      <field name="fulltext">by RICHARD BUCCI</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the opening panel of the 2001 conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship, some interesting remarks about copy-text were delivered by John Unsworth, a member of the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions (CSE). Unsworth said that he had originally planned to tell his audience that "the Greg-Bowers theory of editing" or "copy-text theory" had once enjoyed "hegemony within the CSE," but no longer did, owing to challenges from outside the Greg-Bowers school, where the focus was on other "periods, languages, and editorial circumstances." Unsworth submitted this thesis to Robert H. Hirst, the chair of the CSE at the time, for his thoughts, and reported receiving the following reply:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You seem to imply that all this change is coming from outside the hunkered down group of copy-text editors! . . . it has been chiefly copy-text editors over the decades who have insisted on refining and changing the application of copy-text theory. After all, Tom Tanselle is the only editor I know who's actually published an essay advocating "Editing without a Copy-Text." And long before that, Bowers published his essay on "Radiating Texts," that is, texts for which the very idea of a copy-text was inapplicable. So from my point of view, the hegemony of copy-text theory (both inside and outside the CSE) is mainly in the eye of the beholder, as opposed to the everyday practitioner . Practitioners have always sought to broaden or change everything from the "final intention" goal to (in Tanselle's case) the very idea that any one text should be automatically preferred in cases of doubt. 1 1. "Reconsidering and Revising the MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions' Guidelines for Scholarly Editions," address by John Unsworth from the panel on "New Directions for Digital Textuality," Eleventh International Interdisciplinary Conference of The Society for Textual Scholarship, 18-21 April, 2001, Graduate Center of the City University of New York; quotations taken from printed handout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unsworth was kind to pass on this private communication, since it contains many points worthy of deeper consideration. Hirst's phrase " hunkered down group of copy-text editors" appropriately summons the false image some critics have projected of adherents of the editorial approach inspired by W. W. Greg's 1949 essay, "The Rationale of Copy-Text ," and developed by Fredson Bowers—the better to dismiss them as relics of a by-gone age. This criticism ignores the rich practical experience of "copy-text editing" and the satisfying—one could even say exciting—theoretical developments it has engendered over the years. Hirst also names two outstanding moments in this experience when he mentions Bowers's encounter with what he called "radiating texts," and, most importantly, G. Thomas Tanselle's essay "Editing without a Copy-Text ," which appeared in the pages of this journal in 1994. 2 2. Studies in Bibliography 47 (1994): 1-22, repr. in G. Thomas Tanselle, Literature and Artifacts (Charlottesville: Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1998), pp. 236257 . Tanselle notes that he first presented this paper on 12 July 1993, "as a Book Arts Press lecture during Rare Book School at the University of Virginia" (p. 1); the citations in this paper refer to the SB printing. This essay, which is indeed one of the most important writings on editing to appear in recent times, is concise and not intended to be exhaustive of its subject in and of itself. It stands, however, upon a great body of knowledge, having arrived on the morrow of a long period during which many literary scholars were deeply engaged both practically and theoretically with the Greg-Bowers-inspired idea of copy-text. Tanselle has been the most insightful and far-seeing participant in this collective engagement, and so his recommendation to "move beyond" Greg's "often useful but nevertheless inherently restrictive concept" (p. 2), so that editorial problems may be understood more immediately and with less technical prejudice, should arouse intense interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Tanselle's essay focuses our attention on the point where Greg explicitly limits the role of editorial judgment, and then demonstrates that this seemingly modest restriction has had unexpected adverse consequences. We are reminded that Greg's "strong endorsement of editorial freedom" extends only to the text's substantives (Greg's term for the wording); the copy-text "accidentals" (his term for the spelling, punctuation, word division, and emphasis) are accepted almost automatically (p. 8). While Greg also insisted that the editor be free to emend either the substantives or the accidentals whenever there was cause to do so, his assumption that a copy-text was needed at all was, in Tanselle's words, "founded on a belief that there was usually insufficient evidence for reasoning about accidentals" (p. 9). The copy-text, according to Greg, is to supply the accidentals when variant accidentals from other authoritative texts are not clearly superior—that is, obviously authorial or having more recent authority. Tanselle argues that if the copy-text is used as the "fall-back" text to decide among variant accidentals, and if copy-text accidentals and substantives are to be altered by the editor whenever there is cause to do so, then it stands to reason that the copy-text will tend to be treated as the fall-back text for the substantives as well. This amounts to the " tyranny of the copy-text" which Greg sought to avoid (p. 9)—that is, the copy-text as monolith, unyielding of any word or mark of punctuation that has not been decisively disestablished by the editor. Greg's rationale presumes an ancestrally linear series of texts, from author's manuscript to printed editions. Other kinds of textual traditions exist, and in the late 1960s Fredson Bowers encountered the most common of these in some of the stories of Stephen Crane. The stories were printed more than once, but each time from different, now-lost documents of equal authority. Some appeared in one American and one British periodical, with one printing based on a ribbon and the other on a carbon copy of a typescript made from Crane's manuscript. Other stories were syndicated in American newspapers: the syndicate received a manuscript or a typescript of the MS from Crane, made a proofsheet of it, and sent copies to subscribing newspapers, which used them as printer's copy. The prepublication documents are all lost, so the extant tradition for each story consists of multiple newspaper or periodical printings. Each printing was independently derived of the author's manuscript and therefore all have equal authority. An interesting variation occurred when, surmised Bowers, second typescripts (also now lost) were made of the manuscripts of some of the stories that had appeared in periodicals, in order to furnish printer's copy for book collections . For these stories, all printings have equal authority, but the periodical printings descend from one typescript, and the book versions from the other. 3 3. A typical example is "An Indiana Campaign," a story that was syndicated by Bacheller, Johnson and Bacheller, and printed in the Kansas City Star, the Buffalo Commercial, the Nebraska State Journal, the Minneapolis Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Bowers demonstrated that these six newspaper printings, as well as subsequent printings in the English Illustrated Magazine and in Crane's book, The Little Regiment and Other Episodes of the American Civil War (New York: D. Appleton, 1896), were all based on separate copies of a master proof, and therefore of equal authority. This proof was made, Bowers surmised, of a typescript of Crane's manuscript . The typescript (either the ribbon or carbon copy) was, furthermore, probably the source of another printing, in Bacheller's own Pocket Magazine. Thus, in all, nine printings radiated from the lost typescript, independently transmitting its authority. A variant example is "The Revenge of the Adolphus, " which appeared in Collier's Weekly, Strand Magazine, and Crane's book, Wounds in the Rain: War Stories (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1900). Here, Bowers believed that the two periodical printings were based on a single typescript made from the manuscript, one on the ribbon and the other on the carbon copy, while the book printing was based on a second MS-based typescript; see Tales of War, The University of Virginia Edition of the Works of Stephen Crane, Volume VI, ed. Fredson Bowers, with an introduction by James B. Colvert (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1970), pp. lxix-lxxv, cxxix-cxl. Bowers gave the term "radiating texts" to the tradition he encountered because the multiple printings of each story "radiate" independently from their lost manuscript. Though Bowers recognized that each printing was therefore of equal authority, he still attempted, apparently, to base each critical text on a copy-text as defined by Greg—"apparently ," because, as Tanselle pointed out, he chose his copy-texts "not for their authority but for the extent of their agreement with what he had already decided the text should contain." 4 4. "Editing without a Copy-Text," p. 15. That is, after comparing the texts of each printing, Bowers chose as copy-text the printing that departed least from what he believed were the readings of the lost source. He usually settled on the printing that was most often with the majority wherever there was a variant. Bowers's apparatus reported all substantive variants but only those accidental variants which had required him to emend his "copy-text." Generally, according to Greg's rationale, accidental variants in later editions in a linear series are assumed to be more corrupt than those of an early copy-text, so excluding them from an apparatus could possibly be justified. Radiating texts, however, are not ancestrally linear, and the excluded accidental variants came from documents of no less authority than those Bowers had chosen as copy-texts. Bowers discussed radiating texts in a group of essays, the first of which, called "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," was published in 1972. As the title indicates, Bowers maintained that editing a group of radiating texts involves choosing a copy-text , even if the choice is a "theoretically indifferent" one, made only for the sake of "convenience," after the editor "has reconstructed the lost, common printer's-copy. . . ." 5 5. Library 5th ser., 27 (June 1972): 81-115, quotations from pp. 101-102. Bowers's later considerations of radiating texts appear in "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof 4 (1975): 31-76, and "Mixed Texts and Multiple Authority," Text 3 (1987): 63-90. Since Bowers chose his copy-text after he had established his critical text, the copy-text was completely outside his purposes, and imposed out of mere habit. His insights about radiating texts recalled the way editors of ancient and medieval works reconstruct a lost source when multiple manuscripts descending from it survive—as Tanselle suggested in "Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," an essay from 1983 containing many forward-looking discussions on the relationship between judgment and method in editing in all literary periods. 6 6. Studies in Bibliography 36 (1983): 21-68, see pp. 65-66. Bowers, it may be added, even hit upon a simple guideline loosely applied in the editing of ancient texts, known in that field by its Latin name, "difficilior lectio potior" (the difficult reading is preferable). Bowers did not explicitly cite this guideline, but he caught its gist when he observed that a less common variant might be the authorial reading, since "a majority of compositors faced with an unconventional accidental may sometimes opt for normality, leaving the true authorial reading preserved only by the dogged or indifferent few." 7 7. Bowers, "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," p. 99; for the customary version of this insight, see L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991), pp. 221-222; and Paul Maas, Textual Criticism, translated from the German by Barbara Flower (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), p. 13 (C § 16 (a)). On this subject, Sebastiano Timpanaro has explained (through the English translation of Kate Soper): "anyone who has anything to do with the written or oral transmission of texts (including quotations learnt by heart) knows that they are exposed to the constant danger of banalization. Forms which have a more archaic, more high-flown, more unusual stylistic expression, and which are therefore more removed from the cultural-linguistic heritage of the person who is transcribing or reciting, tend to be replaced by forms in more common use." ( The Freudian Slip: Psychoanalysis and Textual Criticism, London: NLB; Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1976, p. 30 [English translation of Il lapsus freudiano: psicanalisi e critica testuale, Firenze: La nuova Italia, 1974].) Had Bowers pursued the relationship between modern radiating texts and situations faced by editors of older texts, instead of attempting to impose Greg's rationale on his problem, he might have felt comfortable enough to allow his practical insights to shape his theoretical overview . It was Tanselle who recognized the true implications of Bowers's insights, which he revealed in his 1974 article, "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts." Here he recommended editing without a copy-text , explaining that the critical text might be constructed of all the independently derived printings, and supported by an apparatus recording all variants, substantive and accidental. 8 8. Library 5th ser., 29 (September 1974): 330-337; Bowers took note of this article in both "Remarks on Eclectic Texts" and "Mixed Texts and Multiple Authority" (see note 5), but viewed Tanselle's discussion as an intriguing practical suggestion, without recognizing its theoretical significance. Some years earlier, on the other hand, Paul Baender had recognized that a copy-text would be out of place in textual situations defined by multiple independent witnesses of a lost original: see the discussion toward the end of section VI of this essay. In 1979, Robert H. Hirst became the first editor to follow Tanselle's recommendations, in his treatment of radiating texts in Early Tales &amp; Sketches, an edition of some of Mark Twain's early writings. Both volumes in this edition contain critical texts reconstructed from contemporary, independently derived reprints of passages that first appeared in letters in now-lost issues of the Virginia City (Nevada) Territorial Enterprise. In his commentary in the first volume, Hirst cited Tanselle's 1974 essay, and stressed that for the radiating texts, "no copy-text is designated because none of the authoritative texts is genetically closer to the original than the other." 9 9. Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 1 (1851-1864), ed. Edgar Marquess Branch and Robert H. Hirst, with the assistance of Harriet Elinor Smith, The Works of Mark Twain (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: Univ. of California Press), pp. 658, 659 n. 236. Following his own inclinations as much as Tanselle's recommendations , Hirst also reported in the editorial apparatuses of the radiating texts all substantive and accidental variants from all his sources. When in 1990 Tanselle reprinted "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts," he remarked provocatively that "the idea of editing without a copy-text, set forth briefly here in relation to one particular kind of situation, has further applications that ought to be explored." 10 10. G. Thomas Tanselle, Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (Charlottesville: Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1990), pp. 167-176, quotation from p. xiii of the preface. That Tanselle himself undertook the exploration was to be expected. In "Editing without a Copy-Text" he reminds readers of Greg's warning concerning the "tyranny of the copy-text," in which Greg maintained that the failure to understand that accidentals are more often subject to casual alteration, and substantives to purposeful—and therefore, more potentially authorial—change has naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an edition, and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past generation. 11 11. "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography 3 (1950-1951): 19-36, quotations from p. 26. Greg's now-famous essay was delivered for him in 1949 at that year's conference of the English Institute; it was also reprinted posthumously, with a few revisions and corrections he left in manuscript, in W. W. Greg, Collected Papers, ed. J. C. Maxwell (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966), pp. 374-391. References in this paper are to the first, SB printing. Tanselle points out in his essay that like Bowers in his encounter with radiating texts, Greg too was "somewhat tyrannized by the idea of copy-text ," since he also recommended choosing a copy-text in a situation where two or more texts are of equal authority—that is, when there would be no justification for presuming the accidentals in one document to be more authoritative than those in the other (p. 10). What clearly concerns Tanselle most, however, is that in situations where a copy-text is warranted according to Greg's rationale, it tends to interfere with good judgment, by extending its influence, despite Greg's wishes, over the wording of a text as well as the accidentals. The "role of the copy-text," Tanselle remarked, "turns out to be that of supplying readings (of both substantives and accidentals) whenever there seems no other basis for deciding" (p. 9).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The history of editing has moved according to its own logic, marked, on the positive side, both with methodological advances and with compelling demonstrations of the importance of informed judgment. The two elements, method and judgment, tend to appear on the intellectual stage as opponents, and are sometimes identified, respectively, with the ideas that the past is best recovered by either objective or subjective means. The tension in this opposition has generated its share of pointless negativity, but like all dynamic relationships the struggle has its creative potential. In the cycle referred to by Tanselle on the first page of "Editing without a Copy-Text," in which editorial discussions are alternately dominated by objective or subjective orientations, come points where deeper, synthetic breakthroughs seem possible. Not that such breakthroughs necessarily emerge from the discussions to guide editorial activity, but that the potential for holistic understanding exists for editors to exploit, in the best work of those identified with both sides. Ultimately, an editor can draw the two sides into a unitary approach , as A. E. Housman did. Housman the scholar may be most widely remembered for the sharp arguments he advanced in the prefaces to his editions, and in his lectures, favoring informed judgment over the mechanical application of methods. He is also recognized for his great talent for conjectural emendation—the ability to detect and correct corrupt passages without the direct support of documentary witnesses. 12 12. The term is somewhat misleading, since it implies that a reading produced of an editor's thinking is generally more doubtful than a reading present in a documentary source. Good emendations, however—and many of Housman's were very good—can be self-evidently authorial, and may restore or repair a passage that is no longer truly represented in any surviving document. In recognition of one such emendation, G. P. Goold was moved to remark, "It verges on the miraculous that Housman, unaware of what actually happened, was able, by sheer intuition of the poet's words, to restore them" ( Elegies of Sextus Propertius, ed. G. P. Goold [rev. ed., Loeb Classical Library, Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1999], p. 17). Goold's enthusiasm will be familiar to anyone who has encountered such an authentic restoration, though Housman himself might have contested the idea that his emendation (of Propertius 2.12.18) was based on "sheer intuition": see the following discussion. Tanselle discussed conjectural emendation in "Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," calling "delusory" the suggestion that readings based on documentary evidence are necessarily more objective than those based on an editor's thoughts; see Studies in Bibliography 36 (1983): 25-27. Less known is that Housman did not edit by his emendatory power alone. He recognized the importance of all pertinent knowledge and understood the significance of Lachmann's method of the genealogical classification of manuscripts better than those who believed in its oracular powers. On his many-sided considerations, including his careful recensions and careful handling of the recensions of others, did Housman's insights flourish. So dazzling were some of these insights that even canny admirers failed to notice the full range of scholarship which supported them. In La genesi del metodo del Lachmann ( The Origin of the Lachmann Method ), Sebastiano Timpanaro cited the testimony of another that his own teacher, Giorgio Pasquali, once declared excitedly, "C'è uno solo che può far emendazioni, è il Housman" (There is only one who can make emendations: he is Housman). 13 13. Timpanaro, La genesi del metodo del Lachmann, [4th ed.], con una Presentazione e una Postilla di Elio Montanari (Torino: UTET Libreria, 2003), p. 103, 103 n. 39. The earliest version of this work appeared in Studi italiani di filologia classica, nuova serie 31 (1959) and 32 (1960). Timpanaro's source for Pasquali's remark on Housman is the published form of Otto Skutsch's centenary address, Alfred Edward Housman, 1859-1936 ([London]): Athlone Press, University of London, 1960), p. 7. Timpanaro adds that in a lecture he attended, Pasquali admired the genius of Housman's famous interpretation of Catullus 64. For all his admiration of Housman, however, Pasquali did not, Timpanaro notes, hold him in as high esteem as he might have. Pasquali appreciated Housman's great gift for emendation, his ear for language, and deep understanding of poetry, but believed these were humanistic talents, which came at the expense of a more developed scientific orientation to his subject matter. Pasquali's misconception was partly due to Housman's reputation as a critic of the routinized application of editorial methods, and to Pasquali's inability to obtain Housman's edition of Manilius, 14 14. In his Storia della tradizione e critica del testo, Pasquali acknowledged that Housman's Manilius was "inaccessible" to him (see latest reprint of 2nd edition, Firenze: Le Lettere, 2003, p. 392 n. 3). By indicating the importance Pasquali attached to editorial method, the mistaken criticism of Housman paradoxically reveals just how close in outlook these two great editors were. Like Housman, Pasquali is mainly recognized as an uncompromising advocate of thoughtful editing. His famous book grew out of a long critical review (published in Gnomen 5 [1929]) of Textkritik (1927), Paul Maas's (intentionally) severe disquisition of stemmatics. Storia is a monumental demonstration of the unique and concrete character of each textual tradition, and of how the differences limit the usefulness of abstract editorial principles. For Pasquali (and it must be acknowledged that Maas did not disagree with him on this point), there was no acceptable substitute for erudition, careful investigation of each textual situation, and the free exercise of informed editorial judgment. Storia was first published in Florence by F. Le Monnier in 1934, and a second edition was brought out by the same publisher in 1952, with a new preface by the author and three appendixes (including one by Paul Maas). This edition was previously reprinted in 1974 by Mondadori (Milano), and by Le Lettere in 1988. "where," said Timpanaro, "the genealogy of the codices are delineated with a sure hand" (p. 103). To his teacher's view that Housman's genius was "unmethodical," and even "antimethodical," Timpanaro countered by referring to his " profound `methodicity,' " according to which rigorous methodological criteria always guide his emendatio: the material gathered by him, in the prefaces and in the notes to the editions, and in many articles, on the various types of corruptions and their origin, confirms what he always emphasized—that the `intuitive' element necessary to make conjectures must be confirmed by experience and reason; and in this same vein go the syntactical, stylistic, and prosodic-metrical observations that he always considered were necessary to support his conjectures (or his defense of variant traditions: these also exist, and they are, for the most part, excellent). (p. 104, 104 n. 42; translations original to this article) What Timpanaro would have us understand is not so much that Housman struck some adequate balance between method and judgment, but more that Housman allowed his own intelligence to guide his approach to textual problems, selecting and applying the relevant criteria in accordance with the material and his purposes. The example of Housman illustrates the fairness of the view that the opposition of method against judgment is only apparent: method is rather a creation of judgment, a development of it, a particular judgment, concentrated and abstracted. A method, an analysis, or a rule is often independently developed numerous times, and may therefore have more than one author. La genesi del metodo del Lachmann contains the incontrovertible demonstration that the method to which Lachmann gave his name was not really his. Lachmann formally divided the process of editing a text with multiple surviving sources into sequential halves. In recensio (recension), the relationships between the sources are established through collation and the analysis of errors held in common, to determine, ultimately, whether one of the sources is the common ancestor of the others, or whether the common ancestor is lost and must be reconstructed of its independent surviving witnesses. In emendatio (emendation) the common ancestor that has emerged from recensio — whether a surviving exemplar or a conjecturally reconstructed one—is corrected. Emendatio, Timpanaro pointed out, was an art as old as late antiquity, revived by the humanists, and practiced with moments of brilliancy in subsequent centuries by figures such as Giuseppe Giusto Scaligero (1540-1609) 15 15. Scaligero, a Huguenot of Italian heritage but born in France, is known there as Joseph Justus de l'Escale, and to English speakers as Joseph Justice Scaliger, or the younger Scaliger, to distinguish him from his well known father, humanist physician and philologist Giulio Cesare Scaligero (1484-1558). and Richard Bentley (1662-1742). Timpanaro then demonstrated that recensio was the outcome of the collective work of several nineteenth-century predecessors and contemporaries of Lachmann , and its principles were already in place by the time Lachmann summoned them into service for his Greek New Testament (first published in 1831) and his famous edition of Lucretius (1850). Greg's rationale is more rightly named, since it is mainly his alone—though, like all good insights, it rests on the earlier, partial advances of others. Whether a method or a type of analysis was created by a single individual or was the outcome of an entire intellectual tradition, however, it can never be anything more than the distilled thoughts of human beings. Methodological and analytical approaches to editing emerge from the thinking of their creators possessed of some objectivity, for they likely were developed over time, as responses to a variety of experience . Yet they are not natural laws; they can only suggest ways in which judgment might be profitably focused in order to re-create the past. They may be continually tested against new evidence, and adjusted or abandoned, according to the limitations that are revealed by this. They are, in other words, within our control. To regard them as independent of human thought, as existing above and beyond judgment , is a conceptual error that is bound to impede the understanding and resolution of editorial problems. "Editing without a Copy-Text" shifts the editorial point of view from Greg's methodological design to the immediate evaluation of the work being edited. This is as it should be. As every experienced editor knows, textual situations vary, so it may seem axiomatic to say that it is best to approach each new project without the preconceived intent to apply a particular method. Editorial history, however, mainly runs in the other direction, and the shift that Tanselle makes in "Editing without a Copy-Text" is also away from older and more restrictive (and more enduring) points of view than Greg's. That Tanselle carefully prepared the way for this shift is known to the readers of his many essays, in which, over the years, he has investigated a great many of the editorial and bibliographic questions that literary scholars face. The essays are rich in interesting, relevant details, and the discussions are clearly presented, if sometimes driven by an intense logic, which can seem inescapable when a particular point is being made. After all, however, most readers will agree that the true object of Tanselle's discussions has never been to make points but to stimulate serious thinking about texts, and countless passages are given over to fair assessments— and sometimes optimally judicious restatements—of alternative viewpoints . The idea that editors might pursue different goals has been understood by Tanselle's readers as far back as 1976, when his essay "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention" appeared in Studies in Bibliography. 16 16. This essay has an even earlier history, since Tanselle prepared a version of it for another journal in 1968; see the asterisk on p. 166 of SB 29. Here it was suggested that critical texts may be prepared of earlier, unrevised versions of works, or of later, revised versions . The recognition that literary works are defined by a series of historical moments has emerged as an essential principle of critical editing, as the texts of works from more recent periods have come in for scholarly treatment. The chronology includes the moment of first publication, but also earlier and possibly later moments, whether or not these are also adequately represented in existing documents. The failure to grasp this principle has led both to editorial blunders and to the mistaken charge that critical editing is a platonic striving toward a single ideal text, by means of unprincipled or aesthetics-based eclecticism. Over the years, however, Tanselle has clarified and emphasized the centrally historical nature of literary works to such an extent that by now this may be overlooked only through prejudice. Of course in 1976 it was assumed that readers of critical editions were most interested in the text the author wanted, no matter what point in the history of a work the editor was seeking to re-create. This Tanselle noted in "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" ( Studies in Bibliography, 1991), at the beginning of a consideration of the ideas of Donald F. McKenzie, Jerome McGann, and others, which move editorial attention away from the author's text, toward the text as published and received. "Editing without a Copy-Text" appeared at a time when the ideas of McKenzie and McGann had already become popular, if not yet with many practicing editors, then with many who write about editing. In these writings, the emphasis on the social nature of texts is often accompanied by a rejection of the author-centered editorial past and Tanselle's role in shaping that past. The time at which "Editing without a Copy-Text" appeared, then, was not the most opportune for a widespread positive reception. Inevitable is the comparison with the essay it is meant to replace, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," which Bowers used to signal the dawn of a new age in American literary scholarship. Every age has its moods, and presently most editors in this field have the sense of a setting rather than a rising sun. But if an "age" of editions of American authors has entered into a decline, valuable knowledge and experience of the editorial problems of modern literature has accrued. Greg's essay presented the wisdom of a half-century of thinking about English Renaissance texts, which Bowers energetically applied to his astonishing array of editions, including works from each of five centuries . "Editing without a Copy-Text" comprehends both the wisdom of Greg's considerations and another forty-five years of editorial practice and thought. While Greg was tentative about the reach of his recommendations , Tanselle—relying on further history and experience— can confidently advance an "overarching framework" (p. 21) for approaching all editorial goals, in all literary periods. He helpfully calls what takes place within this framework "constructive critical editing," emphasizing that editing is a form of "historical reconstruction," wherein each word, each mark of punctuation, is critically determined by the editor, according to his or her knowledge of the author and the author's associates, the physical evidence, and the purpose of the editorial project (p. 22). Constructive critical editing is therefore not an editorial method, but rather a highly informed state of mind, which, according to the design of each project, draws to its attention all the relevant evidence and applicable supporting methodologies. Greg's rationale, Tanselle points out, may be one of those methodologies, but used to its original, restricted purpose—as an aid, that is, to judge the authority of the accidentals , and not as a base text for relieving the editor of the responsibility for making editorial decisions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Genuinely important discoveries of ways to evaluate physical evidence systematically generate enthusiasms which can sometimes temporarily obscure the abiding importance of judgment in editing. So it was with the discoveries of the "New Bibliography," and so it was with stemmatics. The discoveries of Lachmann and his predecessors certainly put an end to some bad editorial practices, such as the one which favored majority readings blindly, without considering whether the majority was constituted of derivative repetitions of the same error. So much basic confusion and so many worthless manuscripts did stemmatics clear away that some less restrained practitioners applied it in pseudo-scientific fashion, thus achieving insupportable results. On the one hand, it was claimed that the method produced correct readings whenever it did not produce impossible ones; on the other, eliminatio —that part of recensio in which codices wholly derivative of others surviving are eliminated from editorial consideration—was practiced falsely and with a vengeance, so that all that remained afterwards was a sole source. By these errors, described by E. J. Kenney as the "brutal simplification of the textual evidence," errant Lachmannians came close to anticipating by several decades that agnostic rejection of Lachmannism known as the "best text" approach. 17 17. Kenney, The Classical Text: Aspects of Editing in the Age of the Printed Book (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1974), p. 138. Housman, who ranked Lachmann as high as Scaligero and Bentley in his editorial pantheon, did not think so much of Lachmann's mistaken followers, whether they mindlessly believed that stemmatics could extract correct readings from any number of manuscripts automatically, or pretended that it was a just means of eliminating troublesome evidence. Of the motives of those who labored under either misconception, Housman reported, "They must have a rule, a machine to do their thinking for them. If the rule is true, so much the better; if false, that cannot be helped: but one thing is necessary , a rule." 18 18. Preface to D. Iunii Iuvenalis Saturae [ Satires of Juvenal ], ed. A. E. Housman (London: E. Grant Richards, 1905; repr. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1956); quotation taken from extract in A. E. Housman, Selected Prose, ed. John Carter (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1961), p. 58. The term "best text" is usually associated with the anti-Lachmannian approach to medieval literature introduced by Joseph Bédier some years after Housman made these remarks. It nonetheless accurately describes a commonly recurring approach to editing literature of any period. Housman was certainly familiar with earlier generations of it, for in the same preface quoted above he criticized the "precious precept of following one MS. wherever possible." 19 19. Ibid., p. 58. Housman's bold advocacy of critical judgment would have an important if not immediate effect on the editing of literature from the printed age. The founders of the New Bibliography were at first not averse to the best-text approach. Ronald B. McKerrow did not believe that the documentary evidence could sufficiently support much critical emendation of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literary texts. A response to the presence of unreasoned eclecticism in the Shakespearean editorial heritage, as well as to some contemporary scholarship which he regarded as overly speculative , McKerrow's skepticism, while understandable, led him generally to discount the role of judgment in editing. Hence, as Greg made known, McKerrow, in his edition of Thomas Nashe (1567-1601), held that an editor of a work existing in more than one edition, each deriving from the one preceding, had no choice but to base himself on the latest edition known to contain the author's modifications. This text McKerrow called the "copy-text," and he recommended retaining it more or less whole, even though he knew well that but for those late modifications, it was probably less reliable than the earlier text. McKerrow's edition of Nashe appeared in the first years of the 1900s. In later years McKerrow reversed the direction of his practical recommendations , though even then, when he seems to have turned his own theory of copy-text upside-down, he persisted in an agnostic outlook: It might, indeed, be better if in the domain of literary research the words `proof' and `prove' were banished altogether from statements of results obtained , for they can seldom be appropriate. . . . Nothing can be gained, and much may be lost, by a pretence of deriving results of scientific accuracy from data which are admittedly uncertain and incomplete. 20 20. McKerrow, Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare: A Study in Editorial Method (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939), p. vii. McKerrow may have held agnostic views generally, but here and elsewhere in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939) he seemed illogically to suggest that knowledge of the literary past is especially unobtainable. Paul Werstine lately argued that McKerrow's skepticism was provoked by the high-flown conjectures of J. Dover Wilson, and by Greg's (early and selective) endorsement of them. 21 21. Werstine, "Editing Shakespeare and Editing Without Shakespeare: Wilson, McKerrow , Greg, Bowers, Tanselle, and Copy-Text Editing," Text 13 (2000): 27-53. In a 1930 appraisal, Greg drew attention to the allure and the dangers of Wilson's talents ("The Present Position of Bibliography," Bibliographical Society address printed in Library, 3rd ser., 11 [December 1930]: 241-262, repr. in Collected Papers, ed. J. C. Maxwell [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966], see pp. 217-218 of Collected Papers ). Fredson Bowers discussed Wilson's scholarship as a point of tension between McKerrow and Greg in On Editing Shakespeare, a collection of lectures and articles (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1966), see nn. 2-3, pp. 181-186. Yet the Prolegomena also expressed a more positive outlook, in its formulation of a new view of copy-text: Even if, however, we were to assure ourselves on what seemed quite satisfactory evidence that certain corrections found in a later edition of a play were of Shakespearian authority, it would not by any means follow that that edition should be used as the copy-text of a reprint. It would undoubtedly be necessary to incorporate these corrections in our text, but unless we could show that the edition in question (or the copy from which it had been printed) had been gone over and corrected throughout by Shakespeare, a thing in the highest degree unlikely, it seems evident that, allowing for the usual continuous degeneration customary in reprinted texts, this later edition will (except for the corrections) deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript. This deviation is likely to be mainly apparent in spelling and punctuation. . . . We may indeed, I think, take it as certain that in all ordinary circumstances the nearest approach to our ideal of an author's fair copy of his work in its final state will be produced by using the earliest `good' print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author. (pp. 17-18) By these remarks McKerrow seems to have opened the way to editorial judgment that he had previously barred. His death in the year following the appearance of the Prolegomena left his edition of Shakespeare unrealized, but here he seemingly signaled an intention to edit with an awareness of the problem Greg addressed more directly in "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Greg defined the dimensions of the problem with greater clarity and precision, especially by drawing the operative distinction between accidentals and substantives. By identifying and segregating these two categories of the problem of authority, Greg was able decisively to release editorial judgment from the constraints of McKerrow's early view. Among the examples Greg used to demonstrate what he was getting at was McKerrow's critical text of Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller. 22 22. McKerrow repeatedly referred to his critical editions as "reprints"—thogh he emended his copy-texts. Greg called this peculiarity "symptomatic," though he did not say of what; later, Tanselle offered clarification: " `symptomatic'—that is, of McKerrow's pervasive reluctance to give rein to individual judgment" ("The Rationale of Copy-Text," p. 24 n. 9; Tanselle, "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," Studies in Bibliography 28 [1975]: 176 n. 9). McKerrow based his text on the second edition, since evidence indicated that it had been revised by the author. But the editor also believed that Nashe was not responsible for all the changes, and that the accidentals of the second edition were less reliable. Unable to see his way clear to a rational eclecticism—which might have allowed his text to reflect what he knew about the author—he surrendered the better part of his judgment to the confines of what amounted to a "best text." 23 23. That McKerrow was a reluctant conservative has been lately and sensitively demonstrated by Marcel De Smedt in his engaging review, "R. B. McKerrow's Pre-1914 Editions" ( Studies in Bibliography 55 [2002]: 171-183); obviously aware of the issues on which the copy-text debate turned, De Smedt focuses some attention on works within McKerrow's edition of Nashe that survive in more than one authoritative text. One need not accept De Smedt's view that Greg "misleadingly" applied the "best text" (p. 179) label to McKerrow's choice of late copy-texts to agree with him that McKerrow (not, in this respect, unlike Bédier) was a thoughtful editor and did not treat these copy-texts with undue reverence. Worth nothing is that The Unfortunate Traveller is a romance in prose, and by using it as one of his central illustrations, Greg demonstrated that he was not focusing his analysis on a particular literary genre—that is, dramatic works—as is often assumed. Greg was also aware that the "underlying principles of textual criticism" were held in common across literary periods and languages. 24 24. "The Rationale of Copy-Text," p. 23. He especially recognized the relation of the problems he was facing in the literature of the English Renaissance to those faced by editors of classical literature, and he introduced his discussion with an illuminating sketch of editorial trends in the classics, concentrating on the tension between method and judgment . Of course Greg recognized the differences also, mainly nothing that editors of early modern literature concerned themselves with their authors ' spelling, whereas editors of classical literature usually normalize spelling, since their source texts were at too great a remove from the original manuscripts to do anything else. But when Greg warned that "the classical theory of the `best' or `most authoritative' manuscript . . . has really nothing to do with the English theory of copy-text," 25 25. Ibid., p. 20. he did not mean to discourage readers from seeing connections between the two editorial fields. Rather, this warning had the special purpose of preparing scholars of early modern literature to accept what for some would be difficult propositions: that textual authority relevant to the reconstruction of a particular moment in the history of a literary work might be preserved in more than one document; that for the reconstruction to be credible, the editor must be free to draw upon all the authoritative documents, as well as upon his or her own thinking; and that governing power over the editorial process is the mind of the critic focused on this historical problem. Greg's copy-text is not a "best text" or a base text, since it is not meant to decide the wording. It is fair also to say that Greg intended for his copy-text to decide even less than the wording, since he expected an editor to think about spelling and punctuation too, and alter copy-text forms whenever there was reason to do so. While Greg's rationale has a methodological appearance , it is reasonably conceived, since chances are that the earliest surviving document in a series is the one which will preserve the most authorial details. Greg did not believe, however, that the manuscript details of the Renaissance works he was concerned with could be generally restored by his rationale. Few manuscripts, of course, survive. Collateral holographic evidence is usually scarce, and so an author's customary spelling and punctuation patterns cannot often be identified. Overall norms for such details, furthermore, had not yet emerged, and one need not doubt the technical competence of Renaissance scribes, compositors, and proofreaders, nor their disposition to follow copy faithfully, to suspect that they would not hesitate to alter manuscript spelling and punctuation which they believed were deficient or erratic. In view of these factors Greg noted: Since the adoption of a copy-text is a matter of convenience rather than of principle—being imposed on us either by linguistic circumstances or our own philological ignorance—it follows that there is no reason for treating it as sacrosanct, even apart from the question of substantive variation. . . . I see no reason why [an editor] should not alter misleading or eccentric spellings which he is satisfied emanate from the scribe or compositor and not from the author. If the punctuation is persistently erroneous or defective an editor may prefer to discard it altogether to make way for one of his own. He is, I think, at liberty to do so, provided that he gives due weight to the original in deciding on his own. . . . 26 26. Ibid., pp. 29-30. By his eloquent restatement in the Prolegomena of the idea of copy-text , McKerrow revealed that he had been uncomfortable with his earlier conception of it. The new conception that Greg took up, with its reasonable eclecticism and emphasis on informed judgment, was bound to make another kind of editor uncomfortable, one who, unlike McKerrow , was at ease only when hunting in a single text for obvious errors. Greg's rationale challenged editors to face the difficult editorial choices. Aware of the extremes to which classical stemmatics had been taken, the author hedged his recommendations against misuse, by emphasizing that his intention was to clear the way for the intellectual resolution of textual problems, and by his warning about the "tyranny of the copy-text." When the subtlety of Greg's thinking is taken into account, especially his pronounced distrust of even the copy-text accidentals , then the warning seems to have more to do with the original conception of copy-text than with his redefinition of it. The experience of Lachmannism, however, showed that methodological approaches can lose some of their theoretical subtleties in the course of a widely-based practical application. The very presence of a method can entice some editors to focus their energies on questions of its application (in the case of Greg's theory, the choice of copy-text, whether to emend it, etc.), rather than directly on the work being edited. Owing to Fredson Bowers's strong personality and his unique interdisciplinary expertise, Greg's rationale was widely applied, as everyone knows, to the editing of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature. In this field, published works had not received much critical editorial attention, and so it was inevitable that the literary scholars who assembled to prepare the texts of the many editions coordinated by the CEAA beginning in the early 1960s would have had little or no experience with textual problems. Some early efforts were not surprisingly marked by a conservatism characteristic of inexperience, and provide ample evidence of the tyrannizing influence of a designated copy-text. Such a beginning could have been predicted, and over time—just as predictably—better results were achieved more often, as editors gained experience. It must be said, however, that the granting of undue influence to the copy-text continued and continues, in editorial endeavors that stick to copy-text readings rigidly, or select a copy-text with the disguised or half-disguised purpose of excluding other evidence from editorial consideration altogether. Of the two transgressions, the former is the less troubling, provided that the rejected variants are recorded in the apparatus; the second is the more harmful, since the copy-text is chosen in order to withhold evidence from the reader. Either way, however , adherence to Greg's rationale is often proclaimed in the textual essay, while the ostensibly critical text more truly reflects a best-text approach. The failure to recognize radiating multiple authority remains a persistent problem. More than once in the field of American literature , for example, critical editions have adopted as copy-text a first book edition of a work that was also printed serially in a magazine, with both printings deriving from the same typescript copy of the author's manuscript. While the first book edition's accidentals may be followed carefully, with as small a detail as a broken comma reported in the apparatus, the accidentals of the magazine printing are simply ignored, owing to the mistaken notion that scholarly editing means never having to report accidental variants. Bowers, as we have seen, was partly responsible for fostering this notion, which, like the kind of copy-text choice described above, compounds the ill effects of misconceived editorial choices with a deceptively spare apparatus. The main thrust of Bowers's recommendations on apparatus, however, went in the other direction. Here he followed McKerrow's good example, laid out in the Prolegomena, and improved upon it over the years. In 1962 he revealed his plan for the informative apparatus criticus now familiar to scholars of American literature. The plan advised editors to report many textual details, including what came to be called "pre-copy-text variants"—varior evidence of revision found in documents preceding the selected copy-text. 27 27. Bowers, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," paper read on 22 November 1962 at a meeting of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association, published in Studies in Bibliography 17 (1964): 223-228, see p. 228. It should further be remembered that Bowers was also responsible for those deeply penetrating writings on radiating multiple authority, which should convince modern editors of what is more commonly understood by editors of earlier texts—that the existence of multiple independent witnesses of a lost original is an editorial blessing and not a curse. From multiple independent authorities the substantives may be established more securely than from a single line of descent, while at the same time informed choice about the accidentals becomes possible. With his bibliographical experience and familiarity with English Renaissance studies, Bowers was well prepared to direct the attentions of American literary scholars to textual matters, and introduce critical editing into their field. Taking stock of the better preserved historical record of modern literature, Bowers did not simply transfer the lessons of editing English Renaissance texts to the new period. He rather extended the logic of Greg's and McKerrow's recommendations, guided quite naturally by the same overriding interest in what the author wrote. This interest, Bowers understood, could be pursued further in modern works than in works from more remote periods. He also developed the concept of the "author's final intentions," first named by McKerrow, 28 28. Bowers, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," Studies in Bibliography 17 (1964): 227; cf. McKerrow, Prolegomena, p. 6: "For scholarly purposes, the ideal text of the works of an early dramatist would be one which . . . should approach as closely as the extant material allows to a fair copy, made by the author himself, of his plays in the form which he intended finally to give them." in recognition of the ample documentary record of many modern works, which often preserves more than one moment in the development of an author's intentions. The "ancestral series" on which Greg based his rationale was a series of printed texts containing at least two " substantive " texts—that is, texts carrying authority, such as the earliest, or a later one bearing an author's revisions. 29 29. The term "substantive text" was ordinarily used in this way; Greg's use of the word "substantives" to mean the wording of any document was thus doubly unhappy: it could suggest to readers that punctuation was insignificant, and also that wording, by virtue of its being wording, was authoritative. For editors of modern literature , the series may include early draft manuscripts, a fair copy manuscript, typed or handwritten amanuensis copies, galley and page proof-sheets, prospectuses, periodical printings, and first and subsequent book editions (and possibly separate series of these in different countries) . Any of these documents might contain the handwritten revisions of the author or an assoociate; its genetic development may be linear to a point and then radiate from there. Several extant "substantive" texts may predate the first book edition of the work. Bowers created a scholarly edition that made use of this evidence, in a critical text ordinarily (not always) reflecting the author's final intentions for the work at the time of his or her last revision of it, and an apparatus recording much of the history of the text to that point. The author's earlier intentions— whether expressed in a draft manuscript, or a first edition (when there was a later revised edition also)—would therefore be recoverable in the apparatus. Like any good historian—for scholarly editors are historians of the written word—Bowers suited his approach to the evidence. The history of editing is defined not only by advances made within a particular subject period, but also by the belated movement of scholarship through literary time. With each succeeding chronological period coming in for editorial attention, the level of documentary evidence rises, improving in both quantity and quality. Speaking very generally, the evidence available to editors of ancient texts is the most compromised; the situation improves, slowly at first, and then more dramatically, for editors of Medieval, Renaissance and early modern, and modern texts. As Greg noted, editors of ancient texts tend to normalize spelling and punctuation , since the evidence rarely permits them to know anything at all about their authors' preferences. Some authorial details may survive in Renaissance books, and preserving these in a critical text is the purpose of Greg's rationale. Obviously editors of modern literature can recover much more textual history, since they may be able to call upon multiple surviving "substantive" documents, including authors' manuscripts, and possibly external evidence as well (such as letters and other collateral documentation). The intentions of the author might now be understood in their development—how they changed over time, on the author's own initiative, or through a collaborative interaction, with a reader whose opinion the author valued, for example. The degree to which these intentions were respected in the publication process might also be discoverable , and where they were not respected, a cause might be revealed, such as careless typesetting, the application of a publishing-house style, or factors more deeply related to the substance of the work in question. The author's text, for example, might have displeased the publisher, an agent, or even a government censor, for reasons ranging from the commercial to the political. Many editors who have focused on authorial intention are familiar with these relationships and factors, having recorded the evidence of them in their editions and analyzed their significance . Their interest in the author helps them understand that in such situations, authors have sometimes had no recourse but to alter their works, or allow them to be altered by others, according to the demands of those with the power. The essence of editing is in the treatment of the historical evidence. Unfortunately, the vitally important historical aspect of author-centered editing has not always been recognized by its contemporary critics. Those lately emphasizing the social nature of texts have thus negatively evaluated eclectic texts as things unto themselves, without referring to the scholarship—which ought to be published in the apparatus—on which they depend. Of course some editions are more competently edited and therefore more informative than others, but the uneveness in quality has not been an essential target of these criticisms. A well-edited work, however, should contain the evidence of how the author's text was "socialized."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV An unintended consequence of the recent disputes over editorial aims and methods has been the uncovering of a great deal of confusion about the meaning of copy-text and what constitutes the "Greg-Bowers approach." This development is potentially promising, since latent misunderstandings are the more damaging. The shift in editorial focus, from preconceived method to immediate thought, suggested by Tanselle in "Editing without a Copy-Text," provides the logical grounds for clearing the confusion away. Thoughtful Greg-Bowers practitioners, social textual theorists, or adherents of any other editorial approach ought to find in this essay the intellectual inspiration to achieve their particular aims to a high standard of scholarship. While "Editing without a Copy-Text" attempts to move editing beyond the limits of the particular methodological preconception of the Greg-Bowers approach, it also preserves and proceeds from the approach's universal advantages. Among these are, first of all, a great body of practical editorial experience, from which emerge the other advantages—the intense focus on textual history, the high scholarly and technical standards, and the tradition among its best practitioners of the free exercise of informed judgment. Sustaining this common editorial heritage , it may even be said, is the better part of Tanselle's aim. Today's editorial climate, however, is clouded in places with barely qualified rejections of the entire Greg-Bowers experience. While the critics have made many valid points, they have also fallen too often into fundamental misunderstandings . If these are allowed to stand, then little advantage will be taken of Tanselle's essay, and so any assessment of the essay's prospects must engage the criticisms. The most convenient way to do this involves considering the social text as advanced in Jerome McGann's writings, since here the criticisms are reasonably conceived. Jerome McGann has been the most conscientious in attempting to give the sociological approach to editing a theoretical foundation, and in his writings one finds many fair assessments and criticisms of the Greg-Bowers editorial approach. These are marred, however, by some less informed remarks, indicating that McGann has absorbed a few tired misconceptions about author-centered editing. Despite Tanselle's many painstaking demonstrations of their illogic, these misconceptions have appeared year after year as straw-men, set up and knocked down by the opponents of author-centered editing, and sometimes mistakenly defended by those in favor of it. From these misconceptions a reductive shadow of the Greg-Bowers approach is cast, devoid of the approach's defining nuances and flexibility of application. The emphasis on the exercise of sound editorial judgment is especially absent, as is an awareness of the theoretical and practical growth the approach has gone through in recent decades. In place of variegated thought and rich editorial experience come the impoverished notions of the copy-text as a "best text," and of the critical text created according to the Greg-Bowers approach as a timeless, ahistorical, and therefore ideal representation of the author's intentions for his or her work—or, in McGann's words, "a pure abstraction." 30 30. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1983; repr. with a foreword by D. C. Greetham and preface by the author, Charlottesville : Univ. Press of Virginia, 1992), p. 57 (all citations to reprint edition). This second notion is openly proclaimed; the first tends to steal into discussions or take hold of editions semi-surreptitiously . Indicative of the problem is a passage in McGann's 1991 collection The Textual Condition in which two editorial outcomes are falsely set in opposition to each other—"the production of an eclectic text" and "the production of an edition which displays and analyzes the historical descent of the work." 31 31. McGann, The Textual Condition (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991), p. 50. The former idea is identified with the Greg-Bowers approach, and the latter is represented as being foreign to it. Yet the two outcomes are not logically opposed, and a scholarly edition of a work taking the Greg-Bowers approach should contain both an eclectic critical text reflecting a particular moment in that work's history , and a critical apparatus with the evidence necessary to reconstruct other historical moments. Bowers has been much criticized by McGann and other editors on subjects ranging from his overall interest in reconstructing authorially intended texts, to the particular choices he made in the works he edited. What is interesting about a great deal of this criticism is that it is based, at least in good part, on the evidence that Bowers published in his editions. One may go as far as to say that the second of McGann's two editorial outcomes—"the production of an edition which displays and analyzes the historical descent of the work"—owes more to Bowers than to any other editor of anglophonic literature. Early on in his project of transferring to the field of American literature the more exacting standards of English Renaissance bibliography and editing, Bowers declared it the duty of editors to place all their "textual cards on the table—face up." 32 32. Bowers, "Textual Criticism," in The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures, ed. James Thorpe (New York: Modern Language Association, 1963), pp. 23-42; 2nd ed., 1970, pp. 29-54, quotation from 2nd ed., p. 54; Bowers made similar statements in his 1962 paper, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors" (p. 228), and in "A Preface to the Text" in The Scarlet Letter, The Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Volume I, ed. William Charvat, Roy Harvey Pearce, Claude M. Simpson, Fredson Bowers, and Matthew J. Bruccoli (Columbus: Ohio State Univ. Press, 1962), p. xlvii. He demonstrated what he meant in his series of editions, beginning with the Centenary Hawthorne , which presented literary works as they had rarely been presented before. A critical reconstruction of an author-focused text which aimed at what Bowers called an "inferential authorial fair copy" 33 33. Bowers, "Textual Criticism," in Thorpe 1970, p. 33. was accompanied—indeed , inextricably linked with—an unusually full apparatus criticus, containing not only editorial reasoning (textual notes), but the history of the work in its variants from document to document. Bowers even reported authorial alterations in the manuscripts he preferred as his copy-texts. Along with these illuminating innovations, however, Bowers's editions, as was subsequently shown, also contained not a few errors (great and small), needless inconsistencies, and even some apparent sloppiness of form. That Bowers did not always practically fulfill the promise of his pioneering editorial outlook, however, should not be allowed to obscure his achievements. His editions left a good deal of room for improvement, but much of this could be (and was) made on Bowers's own terms—with more careful historical collations, clearer presentations of the relevant textual evidence, a better understanding of the relationship between the critical text and the apparatus, and a greater appreciation of pertinent biographical and historical evidence relating to the author and the work being edited. Since Bowers presented his critical text within the larger context of a scholarly edition, his editorial choices were by and large open to general scrutiny—that is, the alternatives which might be argued over were published in the apparatus. The regular exception, of course, was the accidental variants, which Bowers for the most part did not report. The guidelines of the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA), which attempted to codify Bowers's approach to editing, did not, as a practical matter, require scholarly editions to report them. In his own editions, Bowers cast this practical compromise in more theoretical terms—citing in the Centenary Hawthorne, for example, not only the "copiousness" of the accidental variants as cause for omitting them, but "their basic lack of significance" as well. 34 34. The Scarlet Letter, The Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Volume I, p. xli; the assertion about the insignificance of accidentals was repeated in volumes II-IV of the edition (in "The Centenary Texts: Editorial Principles," the revised version of the essay which appeared in Volume I as "A Preface to the Text"). The unfortunate appearance of this claim—that accidentals are basically insignificant—in the edition to which many apprentice editors looked for guidance had the predictable effect of routinizing the omission from scholarly editions of a class of evidence which at least sometimes was important. Bowers preferred to take an author's manuscript as his copy-text when this was possible, and so generally it was the accidental variants of the first edition that went unreported. The many critics of Bowers's preference for manuscript copy-texts—most prominently, James Thorpe, Donald Pizer, Philip Gaskell, and Donald McKenzie—would not, however, have been satisfied with mere lists of the missing variants. While they disagreed among themselves on a variety of issues, they all believed strongly that the critical text itself ought to reflect the process by which an author's manuscript accidentals were subject to printing-house modifications. Yet given that the alternative accidentals would not be reported in the apparatus, Bowers's choice was, from a scholarly standpoint, the less inconvenient one. First-edition accidentals are, after all, in first editions, copies of which are usually easier to consult than authors' manuscripts. Harder to investigate would be variant manuscript accidentals left unreported in an edition using a first-edition copy-text. McGann endorsed the argument in favor of first-edition copy-texts in A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, holding that it is "clearly more sound than Tanselle's and Bowers's, for it takes better account of the social dimension which surrounds the process of literary production." 35 35. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, 1992, p. 113. McGann's statement shifts the definition of copy-text, if Greg's rationale is at all being taken into consideration, since that was designed not to emphasize the social dimension of texts, but to keep as close as possible to the author's manuscript accidentals. We hardly need wonder what Greg's recommendations would have been if authors' manuscripts of the works that he studied had survived. Despite his overall emphasis on the socialized text, McGann does favor fairly heavy editorial intervention in certain circumstances— though his reasons for doing so are not obvious. He defends, for example , a regularized and modernized "reading text" for early modern works, "to preserve the continuity of a . . . cultural resource." 36 36. Ibid., p. 104. While arguments for modernization have long been made, McGann's is peculiar in its aggressively negative assertions against those who eschew modernization. Tanselle, as McGann notes, has made the obvious point that casting a work of literature in the wording and spelling of a different time period is an "ahistorical" practice; for this McGann accuses him of failing to "recognize the historical dimension of all literary productions ," and failing to understand that "[e]very literary production is `ahistorical.' " As if it were not hard enough to understand how the same person could be guilty of both these transgressions at once, McGann goes on to chastise scholarly editors who seek to conserve Shakespearean spelling and vocabulary, for burying "the factor of the intended audience" under their "social and institutional ideology." 37 37. Ibid., pp. 112, 113. Whatever may be McGann's precise meaning here, what comes through generally is, on the one hand, the belief that an editor's prejudice against the competence of modern readers to understand old texts is a sufficient basis for radically altering them, and, on the other, the denial of scholarly legitimacy to attempts to move closer, by following the evidence, to what might have been the text of the author's final manuscript. According to McGann such efforts are deceptive and reveal a "hypnotic fascination with the isolated author." 38 38. Ibid., p. 122. Or so it would seem. In "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," Tanselle appraised McGann's initially keen appreciation of Hans Walter Gabler's edition of Ulysses. 39 39. Studies in Bibliography 44 (1991): 83-143, see pp. 103-113. Tanselle pointed out that despite its use of some counterproductive novelties—including a confused redefinition of the term "copytext" (without the hyphen), to mean both the constructed critical text and a stage in its construction—Gabler's method of editing was essentially author-focused. Tanselle further showed that McGann's endorsement of Gabler's edition as textually innovative was misplaced. While the mode Gabler chose for presenting the textual history of Joyce's work may have been unusual, the same kind of history is also present in any good scholarly edition with a substantial apparatus. McGann once believed that Gabler's arrangement of this history was a fundamental improvement on Bowers's, while Tanselle explained that such arrangements may reasonably differ as long as the history of the text is expressed adequately. McGann eventually underscored Tanselle's point, by backing away from his earlier appraisal. In his essay on Gabler's Ulysses, McGann praised the editor's "synoptic continuous manuscript text" as a "brilliant editorial reconstruction" that allowed "seriatim reading" of Joyce's work as it had developed. 40 40. "Ulysses as a Postmodern Work," in McGann's Social Values and Poetic Acts: The Historical Judgment of Literary Work (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1988), pp. 173-194, quotations from pp. 175, 181; McGann's reason for not typographically emphasizing " Ulysses " in his title is not explained. A few years later, however, he questioned whether Gabler's edition could "illuminate" issues of textual variation, and ironically asked, "Would anyone think that Hans Gabler's edition of Ulysses is a work to be read ?" 41 41. McGann, The Textual Condition, pp. 52, 96. Tanselle noted that Gabler's understanding of "copytext," the term he attempted to redefine, was problematic to begin with, reporting Gabler's belief that "By common consent, an editor chooses as the copy-text for a critical edition a document text of highest overall authority ." 42 42. Tanselle, "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," p. 106 n. 30. McGann expressed a similar understanding of the concept of copy-text in his essay: In the post-Greg context, the term signifies what an editor chooses to take as the text of the highest presumptive authority in the preparation of an eclectic, or critical, edition. . . . The copytext serves as the basis of the critical edition that is to be produced. The theory is that the readings of the copytext will be taken over in the critical edition unless other readings . . . are positively shown to carry a higher authority. In this theory, copytext is practically equivalent to some document or set of documents. 43 43. "Ulysses as a Postmodern Work," p. 177. This definition of copy-text is not McGann's own, of course, but it illustrates well enough the difficulty that even the most astute scholars have had with Greg's conception of divided authority. McGann has also written subsequently of "establishing" a copy-text, and of the copy-text becoming "eclectic." 44 44. The Textual Condition, pp. 72, 73. This difficulty caused mischief in the interesting appendix of A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism. Here, under the title "A Possible Objection" (pp. 125-128), McGann discusses exceptions to his overall recommendation of an editorial focus on the socialized text. He concludes that in situations of textual "expurgation, suppression, and mutilation," editors had better focus on recovering and presenting the text of the author. The inconsistency of this position remains quite striking. One could expect an interest in texts as social products to sharpen when dramatic differences separate authors' texts from the versions permitted by publishers or governments or some other controlling social factor. The examples McGann used to illustrate the need for author-centered rather than social editing include the published works of John Cowper Powys, which, according to McGann, were ill-affected by the author's fear of lawsuits and a post-war paper shortage. These are social factors, of course, as surely as others whose effects McGann wants editors to respect, such as the imposition of printing-house styles or publishers' wording changes on authors' texts. In his 1986 study "Historicism and Critical Editing," Tanselle well expressed the dilemma McGann faced by selectively advocating a socialized text: either, he argued, McGann is recommending a socialized text only when the editor finds it preferable—which amounts to a call for aesthetics-based editing— or he is recommending it only when the author preferred it—which shifts the overall editorial focus back to the author, where McGann supposedly does not want it. 45 45. Studies in Bibliography 39 (1986): 1-46, see p. 23. The dilemma is complicated by a tangled discussion involving copy-text , which turns on the apparently needless question of whether the expurgated, published version of Powys's novel Porius —the version that, we are told, was "drastically cut back" because of the paper shortage—or the unpublished, unexpurgated typescript text, should be used as the copy-text of a critical edition of the unpublished text. In 1983, when McGann's discussion appeared and most scholarly editors were concerned with representing an author's final intentions, it was generally thought that some works exist in versions too different to be adequately presented in an edition containing a critical text of but one of the versions . 46 46. For these works it was assumed that an apparatus record of the variants necessary to re-create the other versions would be too complex to use easily. Such assumptions— another holds that accidental variants are always too numerous to print—are easily made, and rarely tested; see Tanselle's study, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention ," in Studies in Bibliography 29 (1976): 167-211, especially the discussion in section III, pp. 191-207. Editions had already appeared, however, that ran counter to this supposition, or at least demonstrated that scholarly editions could present a great deal of textual history, including the details necessary to reconstruct more than one version of a work. One of these editions, Early Tales &amp; Sketches, the previously mentioned collection of some of Mark Twain's early writings edited by Robert Hirst, presented critical texts of the early versions of magazine and newspaper stories that Mark Twain later revised—sometimes extensively and sometimes more than once—for a series of book collections. The variants from the later versions were recorded in the apparatus. An editorial precedent for treating a situation even more closely related to the one McGann describes, in which an author's work was grossly altered for clearly practical reasons, had also been set by that time. The Northwestern-Newberry Typee, edited by Tanselle, Harrison Hayford, and Hershel Parker, appeared in 1968, and presented a critical text reflecting Melville's original intentions for his work, as expressed in the first British edition, before he acceded to the demands of his American publisher to soften his criticisms of missionaries. In line with these examples of author-centered editing (though without reference to them), McGann favors presenting readers with an unexpurgated Porius; once this view is taken, it would seem no choice remains concerning a copy-text, since we have been told that there are but two significant documents—the author's original typescript and the expurgated book version. By "copy-text," however, McGann has McKerrow's meaning in mind, since Greg's rationale is only a tool for preserving in a later, revised text, an earlier and presumably less corrupt level of accidentals. McGann does mention accidentals, but the meaning of his discussion about copy-text obviously turns on the widely differing wording of the two versions of the novel. Mix-ups like these have plagued Greg's conception of copy-text for most of its history, partly because its adherents have employed the term as loosely as its critics. Greg recognized two meanings for the term, corresponding respectively to textual situations defined by a single authoritative document, and those involving multiple authorities whose texts relate to each other in linear fashion. His unique contribution—his "rationale"—addressed only the second type of situation. Bowers, with Tanselle's help, came to understand that it could not address situations defined by multiple authorities which descend independently from a common ancestor—that is, a nonlinear tradition. For clarity, he might have added that neither can Greg's rationale be applied to works surviving in a single authoritative source—a situation which, logically speaking, is also nonlinear. Yet when creating critical texts of such works (as Hawthorne's Fanshawe, for instance), Bowers and most CEAA-CSE editors have called the single authorities their copy-texts. Greg also endorsed this wholly different use of the term copy-text, meaning the document whose text the editor "copies" out and then corrects: If the several extant texts of a work form an ancestral series, the earliest will naturally be selected, and since this will not only come nearest to the author's original in accidentals, but also (revision apart) most faithfully preserve the correct readings where substantive variants are in question, everything is straight-forward, and the conservative treatment of the copy-text is justified. Here the "copy-text" is the only "substantive" text. Greg then reemphasized his special rationale for situations defined by "more than one substantive text"—where the copy-text is followed "in accidentals," but "allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings are concerned." 47 47. "The Rationale of Copy-Text," p. 29. Terminology is sometimes regarded as a secondary question by innovative thinkers such as Greg, but one need not subscribe to the views of Derrida to see that the labels by which ideas are known can sometimes decide whether they are understood rightly or not. As Greg noted, McKerrow "invented the term `copy-text' " in his edition of Nashe, "giving a name to a conception already familiar," being "that early text of a work which an editor selected as the basis of his own" (p. 19). The precedence of this definition of copy-text, its simplicity, and its compatibility with the sound of the term itself probably explains why it continues to be used in the way McKerrow defined it. Had Greg labeled his innovation "the rationale of multiple authority editing" or even "the rationale for an accidentals text," some confusion might have been avoided. As it was, Greg's modified definition of copy-text never took full hold in the minds of many professed adherents, and so it is not really surprising that its critics also should have found the concept difficult to grasp. McGann , for example, cites "An Introductory Statement," issued in 1977 by the CSE (the successor of the CEAA), in which it is asserted that a "primary requirement for any responsible edition is that it include a statement identifying the document which supplies the copy-text—that is, the text which the editor is following as the basic text." 48 48. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, 1992, pp. 6-7; McGann quotes a lengthier passage, and refers to his source as "CEAA/CSE Introductory Statement, 3" (p. 131 n. 9). His quotation and citation vary in some details from the version studied for this article, which is: "The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement" (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1977); in this version the relevant passage appears on p. 2. The ancestor of this document, the CEAA's 1972 "Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures," similarly defined copy-text as "that individual manuscript or proof or state of an impression which forms the basis for the edited text; in other words, it is the text which the editor follows at all points except those where he believes emendation to be justified." 49 49. "Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures: A Working Manual for Editing Nineteenth-Century American Texts," rev. ed., Center for Editions of American Authors (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1972), p. 4. Both definitions were augmented with extended discussions of how the copy-text should be chosen and treated, especially in the 1977 document, and generally presented thoughtful and clear guidelines for constructing accurate , informative editions. As official statements, both documents were aimed at imparting vital bibliographic and editorial wisdom to scholars engaged in editorial projects who may not have had much experience in scholarly editing. In line with their educative purposes, the statements may also have deliberately emphasized that aspect of "The Rationale of Copy-Text" in which Greg seems to reduce the importance of the distinction he himself drew between accidentals and substantives, in order to encourage editors to alter either whenever there was reason to do so. Tanselle, a creator of the CEAA and CSE statements, would likely have been responsible for this emphasis. In his influential essay of 1975, "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," he stressed the "pragmatic"—and therefore provisional—nature of Greg's distinction, reminding editors to follow the accidentals of the copy-text only when they had no reason to do otherwise. He noted that resorting to the procedural part of Greg's rationale in such circumstances "is more satisfying than tossing a coin"—an endorsement whose obvious meagerness was meant to illustrate the relative positions of procedure and judgment in Greg's essay. Later in the 1975 essay, Tanselle reasserted that "nothing in Greg's theory . . . prohibits the emendation of accidentals in the copy-text when one has grounds for doing so." 50 50. Studies in Bibliography 28 (1975): 167-229, quotations from pp. 174, 180, 201. This remark was part of a brief response to Paul Baender, who, in his article "The Meaning of Copy-Text," had suggested that the retention of the concept of a copy-text was out of keeping with Greg's main observation, that textual authority might reside in more than one document. Baender was a CEAA editor and inspector, and in this published form of a paper he first read in 1967, he endorsed the use of Greg's rationale for certain situations, while describing other situations for which he believed it was not suited. One of these involved the presence of multiple independently descended witnesses of a lost original—exactly the problem that Bowers would encounter a few years later and acknowledge as insusceptible to Greg's rationale. In hindsight, Baender's early identification of what Bowers later called "radiating texts" is eye-catching, as is his further questioning of whether the concept of a copy-text was ever appropriate, now that editorial "principles have become eclectic." Baender suggested, for example, that McKerrow in his Prolegomena, Greg, and Bowers "may not have realized the full implication of their eclecticism , which in the long run rules out the designation of a single text, basic text, or copy-text when there is more than one text of substantive authority." In an attempt to understand why the concept was retained even though McKerrow's early single-text rationale for which the term was invented had been discarded, Baender guessed that perhaps it was because "with respect to accidentals there still remained a single-text criterion." 51 51. "The Meaning of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography 22 (1969): 311-318, quotations from p. 314. This was the remark that elicited Tanselle's objection, quoted above; in saying this, however, Baender was not quite expressing his own belief, but rather giving his estimate of the belief of others, and the remark by itself does not indicate an aversion to the reasonable alteration of copy-text accidentals. In "The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note," an earlier and more expansive answer to Baender, Tanselle upheld "Greg's theory of copy-text" as applicable "to all situations," while attempting to dispossess Baender of his eccentric insistence on the interchangeability of the terms "copy-text" and "printer's copy." 52 52. Studies in Bibliography 23 (1970): 191-196, quotation from p. 195. This obvious misconception certainly harmed the reception of Baender's other observations, which were also expressed too briefly, perhaps, to encourage exploration of their potential implications. Baender, furthermore , seems never to have pursued these matters, even in his own editorial practices. Instead, in those early days before much editorial experience had accrued in the field of American literature, Bowers and Tanselle sought to foster a position according to which the copy-text of Greg supplied "fall-back" authority for substantives as well as accidentals , while stressing the importance of subjecting the whole copy-text to a thorough critical examination. The plain intention of taking this approach was to maximize editorial judgment, but the approach also risked obscuring Greg's special contribution to copy-text theory; potentially elusive, in other words, especially for newer editors, was Greg's notion that for certain situations, the copy-text is only and at most an accidentals text: "The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text." 53 53. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," p. 26. In the CEAA and CSE statements quoted earlier, the copy-text is represented first as the overall authority for the substantives and accidentals (unless emendation is warranted), whereas in the situations Greg wanted to emphasize, the copy-text would be at most ("generally") the authority for the accidentals. Logically, according to Greg's rationale, no direct causal relationship should exist between the wording of the copy-text and the wording of the critical text. If the two texts agree, it should not be because the wording of the copy-text has simply been followed in the critical edition; rather, the wording of all "substantive" (authoritative) texts in a series collectively establish the wording of the critical edition—where they agree and there is no other contradictory authoritative evidence. Assuming, for example, the goal of a critical text reflecting an author's later final intentions, it might even be said that the wording of the later, revised text is more relevant, even in those places where it agrees with the earlier copy-text, since a revising author who allows some wording to stand might be conferring upon the unchanged passages the fresh authority of his or her new intentions. Where the earlier and later authoritative texts do not agree, the editor chooses from among the variants, according to the chronologically limited set of authorial purposes from which the critical text is being derived. In this example, an editor would favor the later variants (minus errors and changes not ascribed to the author) for the critical text, and report the earlier ones in the apparatus. Those editors of American literature who have understood the meaning of Greg's rationale may not realize that the term "copy-text," in its wider contemporary use—in fields such as Chaucer and Shakespeare criticism , for example—usually carries its original meaning. Editing with a copy-text, furthermore, ordinarily means following the text of a particular document wherever possible, as this typical editorial statement, taken from a (modernized) edition of Shakespeare intended for the college classroom, indicates: Every effort consistent with critical sense has been made to adhere to the declared copy-text . . . , and unnecessary emendation, that pricking devil, has been carefully eschewed. When the copy-text, however, resisted all reasonable attempts to make sense of it, readings from another early printed text or from other editions have, of course, been admitted, but in all such cases the emendation has been placed in square brackets to warn the reader that the text at this point is open to question. 54 54. The Riverside Shakespeare, 2nd ed., ed. G. Blakemore Evans et al. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1997), p. 67. The copy-text is followed conservatively in all matters, that is, for each and every play, whether it survives in a single substantive text or several. The explanation of the use of the brackets invites readers to trust only copy-text readings, and regard what has not come from there with suspicion . Similar statements can be found in other editions of Shakespeare, and also in modern editions of Chaucer's works, where the existence of multiple independently descended manuscript witnesses of all the tales would seem to discourage the assigning of preponderant authority to any one. In "Editing without a Copy-Text" Tanselle acknowledges that the "basic meaning of the term `copy-text' has remained stable from McKerrow's time onward—that is, the documentary text used as the basis for a scholarly edition" (p. 11). On the other hand, he also notes that the term "copy-text editing" is often used by Greg's critics to refer to the editorial practices of his adherents—to the use, in other words, of Greg's rationale. The term therefore signals, after all these years, either of an old pair of opposites—a best-text approach, or an eclectic one based on historical textual analysis. Greg was originator of this duality, and was comfortable using the same term to describe the counterposed approaches , since he felt each had its place. Many of those who took notice of Greg's altered meaning of copy-text, however—whether to adopt it or criticize it—had trouble keeping it apart from the earlier meaning, while editors who were unaware of Greg's considerations (or McKerrow's second thoughts) gave the term in its original sense a wide currency. Whether because the term was too well suited to the meaning McKerrow first gave it, or because the CEAA/CSE upheld an interpretation of Greg's rationale that allowed the copy-text to be used as the fall-back authority for the substantives as well as the accidentals, or simply because easy-to-use "best-text" approaches will tend to drive out more nuanced eclectic ones—whatever the cause or causes, that is—the further existence of Greg's special sense of the term copy-text, as an accidentals text, is in question. In "Editing without a Copy-Text" Tanselle recommends that in constructing critical texts scholarly editors abandon Greg's copy-text (while, of course, preserving his rationale concerning accidentals) , so that it will not be held up falsely, as a truth-giving mechanism , nor used to disguise virtually noncritical reprints of previously published texts as eclectic, critical texts. Should Tanselle's recommendation gain wide acceptance, especially among Greg's followers, the meaning of the term copy-text would, paradoxically, cease its sixty- or fifty-year internal struggle, and resume its original and untroubled one-dimensional appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V If misconceptions about copy-text and Greg's rationale have " mesmerized " (to borrow a term of Greg's) author-focused and society-focused editors alike, it is the latter group alone that has, mistakenly, criticized the authorially intended text as ideal in the philosophical or aesthetic sense. Accordingly, eclectic texts are seen as manifestations of the idealistic philosophical views of those taking the Greg-Bowers approach, views which cause them to pursue a phantom, perfect form of the works they edit. Tanselle has shown that this criticism is not really new: in his entertaining biography of Fredson Bowers, he recorded what must be its earliest appearance, in remarks made by Leo Kirschbaum at an MLA conference in 1959. Kirschbaum believed that an editorial focus on the author's text was out of place in works designed for theatrical performance , and he saw a "Platonic bias" in Bowers's application of Greg-based eclecticism. 55 55. Quoted in "The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers," Studies in Bibliography 46 (1993): 1-154, see p. 105; the persistence of the charge of aesthetic idealism made against "eclectic" editors is partly recorded in Tanselle's later essays, "Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism," SB 49 (1996): 1-60, and "Textual Criticism at the Millennium," SB 54 (2001): 1-80. Kirschbaum was reacting to the very first practical demonstration of Greg's copy-text recommendations, made by Bowers in the first volumes (1953, 1955, 1958) of his four-volume edition, The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker. A quarter-century later, McGann expressed concerns similar to Kirschbaum's: The idea of a finally intended text corresponds to the "lost original" which the textual critics of classical works sought to reconstruct by recension . Both are "ideal texts"—that is to say, they do not exist in fact—but in each case the critics use this ideal text heuristically, as a focussing device for studying the extant documents. Both classical and modern editors work toward their ideal text by a process of recension that aims to approximate the Ideal as closely as possible. Both are termini ad quem which, though not strictly reachable, enable the critic to isolate and remove accumulated error. For the critic of modern texts, the classical model upon which his own procedures are based frequently does not suit the materials he is studying, and has often served, in the end, to confuse his procedures. Because this textual critic actually possesses the "lost originals" which the classical critic is forced to hypothesize, his concept of an ideal text reveals itself to be— paradoxically—a pure abstraction, whereas the classical critic's ideal text remains, if "lost," historically actual. 56 56. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, 1992, pp. 56-57. Critical texts of course do exist. By saying that "they do not exist in fact," McGann presumably meant that they do not exist until scholars perform the necessary historical research and create them. In other words, critical texts do not present the text of any single preexisting document. When speaking of older works, however, it must be recognized that for the most part, the preexisting documents may themselves be described as critical editions. That is, the scribes who made them ordinarily attempted to correct errors that they perceived in their sources, and not infrequently ventured ambitious emendations, whether by conjecture or by consulting manuscripts other than the one they were immediately copying. Many manuscripts are, furthermore, the products of a more thoroughgoing conflation of multiple sources. Most editors, whether they are editing older or more recent works, rather than working "toward their ideal text," seek to reconstruct, according to the limits of the evidence, texts that can be said to have existed "in fact," as long as factual existence is granted to the intentions of the author, whether or not these were ever accurately recorded. In the course of reconstructing the last surviving common ancestor of the extant witnesses, for example , the editor of a classical work may discover that this text—the "archetype"—contained errors. If the editor corrects them, then he or she is departing from the archetype, and moving toward what the author wanted—whether or not he or she ever got it. The same holds true for the editor of a modern work who finds that the author's wishes were contravened by the publisher, typesetter, or even his or her own hand, in the process of writing down the words formed in the mind. Factual existence , that is, can also be assumed of Mark Twain's intentions to write "Becky" and "Rebecca" where he referred, mistakenly and in different books, to Judge Thatcher's daughter as "Bessie" and to the heroine of Scott's Ivanhoe as "Rachel." Tanselle raised the important conceptual points relevant to this issue in "Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism," the 1996 essay (see note 55) that ought permanently to have dispelled the mistaken notion that editors, acting as editors in exercising their judgment, are idealists. He noted that the preoccupation of editors concerned with authorial intention is hardly as McGann has it—with a "pure" artistic form, poorly reflected in the material world—but rather with the more pedestrian problem of "the difficulty of getting words transferred accurately to a physical surface" (p. 12). McGann's misreading partly stems from "his failure to consider intentions as historical events" (p. 13). Furthermore, Tanselle points out, editors create critical texts reflecting authors' intentions not to serve as perfect, stable, or definitive versions of their works, but more basically "because intended texts are not available in documents and therefore cannot be studied without the exercise of critical judgment, leading to attempted reconstructions" (p. 13). For McGann, the idealism manifest in the eclecticism of the author-centered editor goes hand-in-hand with a quixotic desire to fix a "single `text' of a particular work . . . as the `correct' one." If this were true, then his purported counter-emphasis on the "indeterminacy of the textual situation " would be justified. 57 57. McGann, The Textual Condition, p. 62. In his 1994 essay "The Rationale of Hyper-Text ," in the context of an argument against printed forms of scholarship and in favor of electronic forms, McGann expressed his distaste for scholarly editions of the Bowers type as "infamously difficult to read and use." 58 58. Text 9 (1996): 11-32, quotation from p. 13; quotations in this note and the next are taken from the 1996 version in Text. Additional forms in which McGann's "Rationale" appeared are recorded in Tanselle, "Textual Criticism at the Millennium," Studies in Bibliography 54 (2001): 35 n. 54. In his essay, McGann slights the advantages of books, while making exaggerated claims for electronic media. Careful criticism of the "information revolution" is called for from scholars who understand more than its potential advantages. A belief in the inevitability and even the omnipotence of computers has characterized some of the computer advocacy coming from the administrative hierarchies of many libraries, for example, which is causing fewer scholarly books and journals to be purchased, and even the "de-accessioning" of collections, to make room for more computers. Secondary consequences include the depressed state of academic publishing, as scholarly editions of literary and historical works, which were once assured of finding their way into thousands of libraries, can now count only on hundreds. The continuing necessity of books and printed materials from a humanistic standpoint can be demonstrated, in part, by revealing the comparative—and often hidden—disadvantages of computers and computerized texts: their elitism, reflected in the great overall expense and complexity of computers; their impermanence , being subject to, among other inconstancies, the pursuit by their designers, including the U.S. military and the computer companies, of a radical policy of planned obsolescence; the lack of privacy that attends their use; and—not least—their lower compatibility , compared to "hard copies," with human perceptive and cognitive faculties. This remark may explain his willingness to believe that author-centered editors present the critical text as the only "correct" text. Yet what is " difficult " to understand is not the scholarly edition (assuming it is competently constructed), but the "indeterminacy of the textual situation" itself, at least for some works. A scholarly edition allows readers to view a work in its development, by presenting the essentials of its history in the apparatus . The presentation is made mainly by recording the variants, rather than printing multiple versions of the work, but this form is convenient for study, since it focuses attention efficiently, on the changes. If the edition is well-organized, the difficulties inherent in grasping a remote and complex history are minimized with no oversimplification of the evidence. 59 59. McGann emphasizes the inconvenience of the codex form in his "Rationale of HyperText," the better to assert the "revolutionary" nature of the computer: "The change from paper-based text to electronic text is one of those elementary shifts—like the change from manuscript to print—that is so revolutionary we can only glimpse at this point what it entails" (p. 28). The introduction of printing was not a perfect boon to learning (inferior manuscripts were sometimes widely printed; valuable ones were sometimes discarded after serving as printer's copy), but it did make reading easier, or at least no more difficult. McGann's "hypertextual" alternative to printed scholarly editions is, in theory at least, an electronic archive of all the substantive texts of a work in their entirety. Where the apparatus of a print edition traditionally records variants alone, keyed to a single critical text, McGann's "noncentralized" electronic archive would contain all the texts, arranged so that none "is privileged over the others" (p. 31). Such an archive, of course, is to be welcomed, but it must not be regarded as a substitute for original documents or for scholarly books. "Navigating" through a hypertext archive to arrive at the textual history of a work so presented is, for example, a fairly complex process, according to McGann's description of it (p. 31)—and more complex than reading a traditional printed presentation in a book, at least in that it requires special computing skills and access to expensive machinery and Internet connections. A further problem may arise in reader reluctance to read through multiple complete texts of long works, such that this form of presentation could easily obscure, rather than highlight, textual variation. Finally, and not least important, is that like earlier claims about the "paperless office," the claim regarding the "change from paper-based text to electronic text" is in itself misleading. Few readers, that is, will want to read even one version of a novel on-screen, let alone several. The alternative being bulky, unbound computer printouts, the electronic text might be seen as a step backward from the codex, rather than a revolutionary improvement, since for the most elementary purpose—reading—it must rely on a technically primitive form of the technology it is supposedly replacing. McGann is obviously sensitive to many of these issues, but, in "The Rationale of HyperText" at least, he does not clearly separate himself from a kind of triumphalism characteristic of some computer advocacy, warning dissenters, for example, that "no real resistance to such developments is possible, even if it were desirable" (p. 11). The introduction of philosophical language into any discussion ought to signal the deepening of understanding, but the casual laying on of the term "idealist" to author-centered texts and editing has not been helpful. Those who have used it have, most basically, failed to recognize that all scholarly editions present "ideal," or hypothetical, re-creations of past moments in the life of literary works. This is true whether the main purpose of the edition is to present the unaltered text of a document, or an authorially intended critical text. 60 60. It is useful for the discussion that follows to note that Robert Hirst, with his edition of the letters of Mark Twain, has called into question the assumption that the most satisfactory way to represent the texts of manuscript documents is by means traditionally regarded as "noncritical," such as photographic or type facsimiles, or systems of "genetic" transcription. The disadvantages of these alternatives are well known. Photographs unaccompanied by transcriptions force the reader to decipher unfamiliar handwriting (including details of revision) at one remove (or more) from the original; type facsimiles can demand complex feats of typesetting, and at points the principle of visual identity must be abandoned altogether, and some hybrid system developed. Genetic transcription conveys manuscript details through editorial commentary (whether in verbal or symbolic form) inserted into the author's text. That the result is frequently illegible, more closely resembling a textual apparatus than the text of the original document, accounts for why most scholarly editions of letters have opted to make critical presentations in "clear text." Here the editor presents the reader with the text as revised, as if for publication, with the details of revision reported in the apparatus. Legibility is no longer a problem, but fidelity is. For Mark Twain's Letters, Hirst devised a middle way, according to his view that the distinction between noncritical and critical is basically important for scholarly texts, but more a matter of emphasis along a continuum rather than a stark division. His compromise, called "plain text," is a critical text, in that it relegates some manuscript details to an apparatus, though the text includes more of these details than many professedly noncritical systems. Hirst achieved his result by deepening his understanding of nineteenth-century letter-writing and typographic conventions, and by rationalizing the use of symbols and other typographic equivalents accordingly (including strike through horizontal rules for deletions , ⁁ sublinear carets ⁁ for insertions, and italics for underlining ); see Robert H. Hirst, "Guide to Editorial Practice" (revised, February 2002), in Mark Twain's Letters Volume 6: 1874-1875, ed. Michael B. Frank and Harriet Elinor Smith (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2002), pp. 697-725. Either way, a moment from the past is resurrected by a scholar or group of scholars, who collect and evaluate the surviving materials and decide how best to present them, in a process involving human judgment from beginning to end (even when the choices are not explicitly acknowledged as choices). Editors preparing an edition of a work of modern literature must often first decide which moment or moments in the life of that work to present—since sufficient documentary evidence for re-creating several may have survived. As has been discussed, a Greg-Bowers-style scholarly edition usually offers a critical text reflecting one more or less discrete level of an author's intentions for his or her work, while supplying in the apparatus what evidence exists of other levels, as well as a record of errors, and of alterations made by persons other than the author, such as those that yielded the first published text. A social textual editor constructing a scholarly edition around a socialized text must also make a series of decisions. The first and most important of these involves choosing the fundamental conception of socialization that shall govern the text. Two distinct conceptions seem possible: the social text can be viewed either as the outcome of the collaborative intentions of all who took part in the process of publishing a work, or simply as the published text received by its first readers. These two different forms of socialization correspond to different moments in the history of a work, and though these moments may have followed closely on each other, it is unlikely that the same text, nor even the same kind of text, could accurately represent both moments. The earlier moment, the "collaborative" social text, probably cannot be adequately represented by reproducing the text of any one preexisting document, and so an eclectic critical text is here indicated. The later moment, the "received" social text, is by definition the text of a particular document, and to represent it, an essentially noncritical presentation is called for. 61 61. Some years ago Tanselle identified and discussed exactly these two possible varieties of the social text, as "a publisher's intended text" requiring "critical reconstruction" on the one hand, and an "unaltered reproduction" of "what the publisher in fact did publish" on the other. Tanselle sees the latter variety as the most useful complement to authorially intended critical texts; see "The Text of Melville in the Twenty-First Century," his contribution to Melville's Evermoving Dawn: Centennial Essays, ed. John Bryant and Robert Milder (Kent, Ohio: Kent State Univ. Press, 1997), pp. 332-345, quotations from pp. 337-338. To re-create the collaborative social text, the editor must deal with the problem of errors, since, presumably, all involved in the publication process intended for the text to be without errors. Of course once social textual editors admit that human intentions are historical facts, then they are, despite their different goal, operating within the same concept of history as author-focused editors. The decision to correct errors, furthermore , means that social textual editors are sharing a concern with their author-centered counterparts. Here they must resist the temptation , apparently felt by some with social textual interests, to limit their corrections to obvious errors. The reader does not really need a scholarly editor to find obvious errors; however, obviousness is not an essential characteristic of errors. There are also errors that are not obvious, and to correct these, access to original documents and specialized knowledge is needed. For scholars to restrict their own editorial judgment artificially just at this point, where it might be of help to readers, is, it must be said, intellectually irresponsible. On the other hand, an editor presenting a "received" social text would not correct original errors, since here the object would be to reproduce the text experienced by its early readers, and the errors were, of course, part of that experience. A further issue concerning the nature of texts is worth remarking upon at this point, as it helps further reveal the inadequacy of the idea that author-centered critical texts are idealistic abstractions, while preexisting texts are faithful expressions of material reality. It is the observation , made briefly by Tanselle in "Editing without a Copy-Text" and discussed more expansively by him elsewhere, that the texts of documents are not literary works in themselves, but rather sets of instructions for the re-creation of these works. 62 62. "Editing without a Copy-Text," see pp. 5-6; the longer discussion appears in A Rationale of Textual Criticism, A Publication of the A. S. W. Rosenbach Fellowship in Bibliography (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1989); see especially chapter 1, "The Nature of Texts," pp. 11-38. Readers of A Rationale of Textual Criticism, the slightly revised published version of Tanselle's 1987 series of Rosenbach lectures, will be especially familiar with this insight, which memorably relates literary works to works of music or dance, while distinguishing them from works of painting or sculpture. In the former grouping are works conveyed in "intangible" media—language, sound, movement. Their "tangible" artistic compositions—documentary linguistic texts, musical scores, dance notations—are unlike the tangible creations of painters or sculptors in that they are not the works themselves , but rather the forms into which intangible works must be converted so that they may be reconstituted and experienced. These forms consist of complex series of marks—as many (for a novel, for example) as a million or more letterforms, symbols, and spaces. Being highly complex , texts of documents are therefore also potentially highly unstable, prone to heavy levels of accidental alteration every time they are copied. While scholars might agree on what constitutes the text of a particular document, they will likely come up with different answers to the question of how accurately it records the instructions of the author. By embracing the roles of those who worked with the author, social textual editors might expect the problem of the textual fidelity of documents to diminish. Where, for example, the author-centered editor would find infidelity, the social textual editor would presumably endorse a text in which a publisher's copy-editor has regularized an author's punctuation or toned down his or her colorful language. Yet for an editor interested in the collaborative social text, there remain the questions of how accurately the text as first published reflects the intentions of the copy-editor, where alterations were desired, and also of the author, where his or her text was allowed to stand. As for the editor desiring to present a received text to modern readers, he or she faces a number of questions about how best to re-create that early reading experience. The editor may have to decide which of several early published forms of the work to re-create, and whether the chosen text—say it is the first book edition of a novel— should be reproduced in an exact transcription or in photographic facsimile . The text of the chosen edition will have to be investigated by comparing numerous copies. If press variants are discovered, these should, of course, be recorded in the scholarly edition, but their presence would require a basic textual decision, about whether the scholarly text should reflect a particular variant state or the edition as a whole. 63 63. A view of the "edition as a whole" can be attained with more or less clarity, according to the number of copies examined proportional to the original total. The concept of "ideal copy," a bibliographical description of all variations present in the copies of an edition as they left the control of the publisher, emerges in this context. In the course of defining this concept more than twenty-five years ago, Tanselle had cause to refer to the bibliographical responsibility of editors of noncritical editions. These remarks are especially pertinent: "Just because editors of noncritical editions do not have to make critical choices among individual variant readings does not absolve them of the responsibility for knowing what variants exist within the edition they are concerned with; choosing a copy for reproduction is itself a critical choice, and it should be as informed a choice as possible. When a descriptive bibliography has sorted out the various states comprising the ideal copy (or, it might be better to say, the ideal copies) of an issue, the editor of a noncritical edition can use this information with great profit. But when that bibliographical work has not been performed, the responsible editor of a noncritical edition has no alternative but to undertake the task. Editing, even of noncritical editions, cannot be divorced from descriptive bibliography and from the concept of ideal copy. " ("The Concept of Ideal Copy, " Studies in Bibliography 33 [1980]: 18-53, quotation from p. 37.) Answering the questions inherent in a social textual undertaking might easily demand as much critical thinking as is expended in author-centered editing, and whether social textual editors seek to present critical or essentially noncritical texts, they should find the author-centered editorial past full of useful lessons (both positive and negative) on the construction of scholarly editions—especially in the matter of scholarly apparatus. Opposition to the concept of authorial intention and the belief that the eclectic text is an ahistorical, idealistic abstraction turn out to be counterproductive of thoughtful editing, no matter what editorial goal is being pursued. By accepting instead of rejecting historically determined eclecticism, social textual editors not only would avoid falling into logical contradictions, they would find themselves able to correct unintended errors more efficiently, by making optimum use not only of their own powers of observation but also of the ascertainable knowledge of the habits and activities of those originally engaged in the publication process. In discarding logically untenable objections to the Greg-Bowers tradition, furthermore, social textual editors might better appreciate the revealing textual histories available in editions whose critical texts reflect an authorial focus. They might discover that the word "final" in "final intention" has sometimes meant that the contributions of an author's welcome collaborators have been admitted to the critical text, since its aim may be to reflect the text the author wanted, whether or not these wants were influenced by others. Author-centered editing is, of course, also sensitive to what authors did not want. From this sensitivity too comes much that should be of absorbing interest to the social textual editor. Scholars interested in the social text would hardly want to limit their understanding of printing-house styles, for example, by remaining in the dark about the author's competing preferences, if those can be known; nor, when faced with expurgated texts, would they want to investigate the differences between authors' and publishers' texts (as well as the causes of the differences) any less thoroughly than do author-focused editors. The pressures brought by others upon the author to alter his or her text are evaluated with care by the author-centered editor, to determine whether the resulting changes were accepted in the spirit of willing collaboration, or were forced upon an author who had little choice in the matter. While social textual editors may not be interested in a critical text that remakes this result in the author's favor, they should nonetheless welcome the presentation in the apparatus of the evidence of how the author's text was forcibly socialized (if this was the case), and find ways to match or improve on such presentations in their own editions. Such typical editorial problems help reveal that the social and authorial focuses in editing have many concerns in common. What they do not have in common, however, is a history. All of that —the experience, the insight, the technical skill—has been gained in pursuit of the author's text, which is why it is imprudent, to say the least, for those interested in the social text to continue denying the validity of the Greg-Bowers approach . Many benefits would consist in accepting its validity and absorbing the lessons of its historical experience, including, most obviously for the social textual editor, how best to identify and account for non-authorial contributions to the development and production of texts. In the compelling final pages of "Editing without a Copy-Text," the author conveys the essence of his recommendations by calling the reader's attention to the proven editorial conception of radiating texts. The advantages to reading and scholarship of having more than one independent documentary witness of the same lost text are self-evident. That a critical reconstruction of the lost common ancestor, and its accompanying apparatus of rejected variants, do not practically require a base- or copy-text has been proven. The designation of a copy-text in such situations , furthermore, needlessly obscures the textual genealogy, and potentially clouds the editor's judgment. Once it is established that a group of sources descend independently from the lost ancestor, then any text in the group may be right against the others at any point of variance. All editorial choices must therefore be active choices; none can be made by default, by resorting, thoughtlessly, to a copy-text. At points where variants "seem `indifferent,' " Tanselle writes, an editor may of course choose a reading from the text that supplies the largest number of other reeadings; but the decision is still an active one, in which one of the factors taken into account is the apparent general reliability of a particular text. The process remains one of building up a new text rather than making changes in an old one. (p. 19) This is the approach that Tanselle proposes be taken to all textual situations , not only those involving radiating multiple authorities. 64 64. That Tanselle's model for constructive critical editing is the approach to radiating texts already proven by him and Bowers, among others, has implications for the scholarly apparatus, though these are not spelled out. The author's name alone should, however, be indication enough that the scholarly standards inherent in editing without a copy-text are very high, and involve the scrupulous disclosure of bibliographic and textual evidence. If critical editing has permanent scholarly value—and the foregoing discussions have attempted to show that it has, no matter what editorial goal is being pursued—then editorial judgment must not be unreasonably restricted. As we have seen, even the most thoughtful editors have fallen victim to the "tyranny of the copy-text"—despite Greg's warning about it. Accordingly , Tanselle, rather than issuing a stronger warning, has proposed that the truest way to stay clear of unreasoned results is to remove the copy-text from the editing process, since it has proven after all to impede serious thinking about the wording of critical texts. Tanselle's recommendation may be said to consist of two parts: 1) as explained in his essay, the concept of editing without a copy-text, and its practice, modeled on the experience with radiating texts; and 2) the many lessons of a long editorial past, on which his concept depends and which he assumes will have been understood by its practitioners. These lessons contain both negative messages (such as warnings about the potential deceptiveness of facsimiles, the tyranny of the copy-text, or the limitations of mathematical schemes for evaluating variants), as well as many positive ones. The lessons of the New Bibliography, the observations of Greg and others about textual genealogy, the insight about the potential superiority of difficult or unusual variants, paleographic analysis—all editorial and wider historical knowledge, that is—retain their value within Tanselle's framework. To edit without a copy-text, editors focus on the editorial problem with the maximum amount of relevant knowledge obtainable. This knowledge aids, rather than substitutes for, editorial judgment. Judgment is "clearly in the dominant position" (p. 20). The distinctiveness of Tanselle's approach is emphasized in his assessment of the likelihood that an editor employing Greg's rationale but without recourse to a copy-text might "select" some of the same readings that would have been "retained" had a copy-text been designated. Here Tanselle rightly insists that the distinction between the two approaches is nonetheless essential: the difference between these two justifications for the same decision is not superficial: it goes to the heart of what critical editing is. The key point is not whether an editor would make the same decision by following Greg's rationale or by designating no copy-text but still following Greg's argument for the presumptive authority of the text closest to an authorial manuscript. . . . The important point is that the former approach places a rule above reason (as any recourse to a fall-back position must do), whereas the latter restructures the problem so that the editor's decision (even if it is the same decision) results from the positive step of taking a reasoned action (p. 19) Tanselle has taken care that his recommendation embraces all critical-historical editorial goals, including the author's "finally intended" text, earlier or later authorially intended texts, and socialized texts emphasizing the contributions of the publisher's staff. His plan for " constructive critical editing" (p. 22) is therefore "a framework that liberates editorial judgment from the concept of copy-text while being neutral in itself as to the goal toward which that judgment should be directed" (p. 21). Perhaps, as it becomes widely adopted, every truly important editorial insight, such as Lachmann's or Greg's, is fated to go through a period of overwork. Stemmatics was worked very hard for about fifty years, before Housman and others pointed out the uselessness of much of its product and reminded those who were listening that no mechanism can rightly substitute for an editor's good judgment and expert knowledge of his or her subject. As the writings of Giorgio Pasquali, Sebastiano Timpanaro, L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson, E. J. Kenney, Bruce M. Metzger, and many others reveal, the best scholars of literature from the remote past have long since recommended a thoughtful approach to editing, appreciating the limitations as well as the benefits of methodologies and formulaic analyses, drawing upon them as needed, to aid, rather than override, thought. Fraught as the editorial outlook for more recent literature now appears, here too it seems inevitable that the most thoughtful scholars will move in a similar direction, if they haven't already begun the process. The shift in editorial orientation may take a while longer, since divisive, extraneous prejudices against author-centered editing, which have needlessly accompanied the appearance of social textual concerns, have yet to fade from the scene. But sooner or later, the characteristically generous and inviting spirit of G. Thomas Tanselle's profound essay will attract to it the best editorial minds of all orientations.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">by G. THOMAS TANSELLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN JUNE 1971, I PUBLISHED IN THE LIBRARY AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "Book-Jackets, Blurbs, and Bibliographers" (5th ser., 26: 91-134), which set out to give a brief history of the book-jacket, to recite some of the reasons for the importance of jackets in historical research , and to offer suggestions for recording jackets in descriptive bibliographies . To that account I appended a list of some 260 examples of pre-1901 printed jackets, slip-cases, and other detachable coverings. Now, over three decades later, I should like to add a postscript to the earlier piece, reporting on developments in the study and preservation of dust-jackets 1 1. I use "dust-jacket" and "book-jacket" interchangeably; but I never use "wrapper" for "jacket," reserving "wrapper" for paper covers that are attached to a book or pamphlet. in the intervening years and providing a new list of early examples.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I spoke in 1971 of the "general neglect" of book-jackets, I was aware that some collectors had for decades been willing to pay premiums for books in jackets; I was referring to the fact that many people still regarded them as unworthy of serious bibliographical attention. Most printed ephemera go through a stage of being disregarded and discarded before their historical value is recognized; that book-jackets had not fully emerged from that stage in the early 1970s is suggested by an anecdote John Carter revealed to me. My 1971 article originated as a paper that I delivered before the Bibliographical Society in London on 17 March 1970, during Carter's presidency. He had been pleased when I had proposed that topic in response to his invitation to speak, for he always welcomed any scholarly development in the study of nineteenth-and twentieth-century books. He had long been interested in jackets himself, having located an 1832 example thirty-six years before; and his discussion of jackets in his ABC for Book-Collectors (1952) had been ahead of its time, sketching the history of jackets accurately, mentioning their historically valuable features (such as illustrations and blurbs), and noting that the concept of original condition demands their presence, even when they lack such interesting features. I gave Carter a copy of my paper a few days before the meeting, and his way of expressing his satisfaction with it was to suggest that I had justified his advocacy before the Council of the Bibliographical Society: he sent me a note at my hotel saying that "there were a few sniffs among the stuffier characters when your topic was announced (by me, with enthusiasm), as if such things as dust-jackets were a trifle frivolous—and this should blow them out of the water." Even allowing for a little over-dramatizing of the situation, I have no doubt that Carter's characterization of the Council's attitude was essentially accurate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would not wish to claim that no such sniffs would be possible today, but certainly jackets have come to be taken more seriously over the past thirty years, at least by collectors, dealers, bibliographers, rare-book curators, and historians of graphic art, if not always by publishing historians and non-rare-book librarians. Indeed, Brian Alderson has said that the date of my article "may be considered, coincidentally, as the time when disregard [for jackets] began to lessen." 2 2. "Book-Jackets: Their Irresistible Rise," Matrix, 24 (2004), 122-127 (quotation from p. 122). A book published shortly after my article could still refer to collectors throwing jackets away: Philip Gaskell, in A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), says, "The bibliographical importance of twentieth-century dust jackets is obvious enough, although librarians (and, more surprisingly, book collectors) often throw them away" (pp. 249-250). In his brief discussion of jackets, Gaskell states that, "with the exception of the paperback revolution . . ., the most striking innovation in the presentation of books in the first half of the twentieth century was the development of the dust-jacket as an advertising medium." Perhaps the change that Alderson refers to is reflected in Geoffrey Ashall Glaister's Glossary of the Book, where the short entry on jackets, unillustrated in the first edition (1960), is accompanied by a full page of illustrations in the second (1979). The points I made thirty years ago are still valid, and what I have to say now will not supersede them. But I can supplement those earlier remarks in three ways: by surveying what has been written about jackets since 1970; by examining the role of dealers in calling attention to jackets and thus assisting in their preservation; and by augmenting my earlier discussion of the kinds of documentation that jackets offer—the information they transmit and the evidence they provide for the history of jackets themselves—supported by an appended list of early examples that incorporates those I have learned about since 1970. 3 3. One should therefore turn to the earlier article for references to most of the pre-1970 dust-jacket literature and for many other examples (besides those now provided) of jackets that illustrate various points, as well as for observations not repeated here (such as suggestions for describing jackets). The 1971 article was also accompanied by ten illustrations (references to other published illustrations of early jackets and slip-cases are included in the relevant entries in the list appended to the present article). In the end, I hope that these comments will encourage further recognition of the various ways in which book-jackets constitute one of the most significant classes of printed ephemera and a basic category of evidence for publishing history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The most consequential book on dust-jackets is the most recent, Ned Drew and Paul Sternberger's By Its Cover: Modern American Book Cover Design (2005), which studies the influence of European modernism and eclectic postmodernism on twentieth-century American designs for jackets and paperback covers. Its starting point is the "rise of the book jacket as an object of graphic design" (rather than what led to that rise); and it notes perceptively that the rise "coincided with the definition of the field of graphic design as a profession" and with the dominance of modernism as an artistic program. Therefore the jacket was in a position to become a "forum" in which designers could " engage modernism and define their practice" (p. 20). The authors offer a well-illustrated historical analysis of the evolution of jacket and cover designs from Rockwell Kent and Ernst Reichl in the 1930s to Chip Kidd and John Gall at the end of the century, tracing the artistic movements and cultural issues, as well as the commercial demands, reflected in those designs. This book caught the attention of John Updike, who wrote a piece about it for The New Yorker ("Deceptively Conceptual," 17 October 2005, pp. 170-172), thus creating one of the rare instances when a major author has reflected on book-jackets in a popular magazine. Other book-length treatments of dust-jackets in the past thirty years have followed the general pattern of Charles Rosner's pioneering The Growth of the Book-Jacket (1954)—that is, a rather breezy text accompanied by a large number of illustrations, primarily from the 1920s and onward. 4 4. Rosner's book was reviewed in the Bookseller, 11 September 1954, pp. 918-920 ("The Development of the Book Jacket as a Selling Aid"), and several letters followed (see 22 September, pp. 1052-54, and 16 October, p. 1264). Rosner himself published a number of articles on jackets (largely on their design); among those not cited in my 1971 article is "Book-Jackets," Books [National Book League], 295 (September 1955), 149-150. (Letters on jackets appeared in the same journal several times that year: 293 [April/May], 103; 295 [September], 166; 298 [December], 261-263.) There is nothing wrong, of course, with paying attention to the designs of post-1920 dust-jackets, since they constitute an important genre of twentieth-century graphic art; but one wishes that jackets could receive more thorough historical treatments, even for the period covered by these books and certainly also for the earlier period, when most jackets were not artistically interesting. Thus Alan Powers's two recent books, Front Cover: Great Book Jackets and Cover Design (2001) and Children's Book Covers: Great Book Jacket and Cover Design (2003), provide a considerable repository of illustrations of jackets (along with front covers of books, especially paperbacks); and, being organized chronologically, they do make a sketchy start on a historical account. 5 5. They are discussed in some detail by Brian Alderson in the review cited in note 2 above. Although the second of these books shows some covers of children's books going back to the eighteenth century, it pays no attention to pre-twentieth-century detachable coverings (except for one illustration of an 1830 slip-case). And the earlier book, containing a brief chapter called "The Evolution of the Book Jacket" (pp. 6-11), devotes less than one paragraph to the period before 1901 and makes the erroneous statement that "Only after 1900 did book jackets begin to become commonplace" (p. 7). 6 6. Sloppy writing makes another comment of his harder to evaluate: "Even today, collecting book jackets is relegated to a class of trivia unworthy of the true collector" (p. 6). If he is referring to collecting books in jackets, he is clearly wrong, because serious collectors of twentieth-century books do not now usually regard jackets as trivial. If he is referring to collecting jackets without books, he is correct that it is not much practiced (nor should it be, though anyone who encounters a separated jacket ought to preserve it). But perhaps his statement is merely a reflection of the general unease that people have felt in taking jackets seriously. A decade earlier, Steven Heller had brought out two similar books. 7 7. And recently he published a collection of twenty postcards called East Side West Side &amp; Other New York City Book Jackets from the 1920's &amp; 1930's (2003). The first, Covers &amp; Jackets!: What the Best Dressed Books &amp; Magazines Are Wearing (1993), compiled with Anne Fink, emphasizes the artistry, rather than the history, of jackets and magazine covers, offering a large number of color illustrations. The other, Jackets Required (1995), produced with Seymour Chwast, is described by the subtitle on its front cover: "An Illustrated History of American Book Jacket Design, 19201950 ." After a hundred pages of illustrations of miscellaneous designs (first for fiction, then nonfiction), the remaining thirty pages are devoted to "The Great Designers," with sections showing the work of E. McKnight Kauffer, W. A. Dwiggins, Arthur Hawkins, Georg Salter, Alvin Lustig, and Paul Rand. The minimal attention, in the introduction, to the early history of jackets (pp. 11-12) accurately takes note of the "package-style" wrapping used in the mid-nineteenth century but inaccurately claims that jackets' "aesthetic, or even promotional, potential was ignored until after the turn of the century." 8 8. A statement at odds with one made in his earlier book: "By the turn of the century the dust jacket was the publishing industry's primary promotion tool" (p. [16]). One does not go to this book, however, for information on the nineteenth century; and its survey of the great period of 1920-50 reflects a serious historical interest— as shown in the statement that jackets of these years "are artistic treasures every bit as endemic to this modern visual culture as are the great affiches from 1920s and 30s France, Germany, and Italy" (p. 7). 9 9. Another 1995 compendium of illustrations showing an interest in the artists is John Cooper and B. A. Pike's Artists in Crime: An Illustrated Survey of Crime Fiction First Edition Dustwrappers, 1920-1970, which includes an index of artists (pp. 192-198) and notes that interest in these jackets "is intense among collectors" (p. ix). Recognition of the place of book-jacket design in art history has led to books about individual designers and to exhibitions. 10 10. It is also reflected in the inclusion of discussions of jackets in surveys of design history: thus Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton, and Ghislaine Wood's Art Deco 1910-1939 (2003), the catalogue of a great Victoria and Albert exhibition, contains a chapter on "Art Deco and the Book Jacket" by Rowan Watson and Annemarie Riding (pp. 308-311), linking jacket design with the commercial adaptation of the language of avant-garde art. Not surprisingly , George (Georg) Salter, who had already been the subject of an exhibition and a small catalogue at least as early as 1961, 11 11. George Salter: A Third of a Century of Graphic Work (Gallery 303, 1961). Even earlier the Gotham Book Mart had published a small selection of illustrations of Alvin Lustig's jackets ( Bookjackets by Alvin Lustig for New Directions Books [1947]); and Jonathan Mayne wrote a book on Barnett Freedman (1948). has recently been accorded substantial monographs in German and English. 12 12. Jürgen Holstein's Georg Salter: Bucheinbände und Schutzumschläge aus Berliner Zeit 1922-1934 (2003), including a checklist on jacket design; and Thomas S. Hansen's Classic Book Jackets: The Design Legacy of George Salter (2005). And there have now also been books on Vanessa Bell (1984, 1999), Brian Cook (1987), Chip Kidd (1993, 2003), Don Maitz (1993), Wendell Minor (1995), Stephen Bradbury (1996), Richard Powers (2001), and Ezra Jack Keats (2002), among others. 13 13. Details about these books can be located online in WorldCat, where one can also learn the locations of some of the collections of designers' papers that contain material for the study of jacket design. (Other websites with information about jackets can of course be located through Google or other internet searching systems.) One example of a relevant archive is the large collection of Decorative Designers papers in the UCLA Library. Archives also sometimes come on the market: for example the artist A. E. Batchelor's own file of forty-five of the jackets he designed in the 1920s and 1930s was offered for sale by Lea Valley Books (Hastings) in catalogue 81 (February 1978), item 28 (£22). (The album of Hilgenreiner proofs in the 1984 Leach sale is briefly described in part II below.) The 2005 publication of a collection of Chip Kidd's jackets ( Chip Kidd: Book One ) was the occasion for a New York Times article that states, "He put `famous' and `dust jacket designer' in the same sentence" ("The Book on a Graphics Superhero," 3 November 2005, pp. F1, F6). Examples of recent exhibitions of jackets 14 14. The idea of exhibiting jackets is of course not new. As early as 1932 a group of jackets was lent by Lloyd LaPage Rollins for display in the Department of Art at the University of California, Berkeley. And a major international exhibition, "The Art of the Book Jacket," was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1949; it received some skeptical remarks in The Observer from Max Beerbohm, who said he had seen "many such exhibitions " in bookshops, where he could "witness a terrific scene of internecine warfare" between jacketed volumes "striving to outdo the rest in crudity of design and of colour" (quoted by Horne [see note 15 below], p. 35). The Book Jacket Designers Guild began holding annual exhibitions in 1948 (other series of annual exhibitions that include jackets have been held by the American Institute of Graphic Arts—including one on the history of jackets in 1950—and the American Association of University Presses). A few examples of attention to jackets in design magazines are Mischa Black, "The Dust Wrapper," Typography , 4 (Autumn 1937), 7-9; "New Look in Jackets," AIGA Journal, 1 (1947-48), 108-109; and Gini Sikes, "Judging a Book by Its Cover," Metropolis, 6.5 (December 1986), 38-43, 53, 55. Design is the principal concern of William Lowndes in "The Lure of the Book-Jacket," Library World, 53 (1950-51), 280-281 (though some inaccurate comments on the early history of jackets are also included). Examples of discussions of designs focusing on the jackets for single authors are Keith Cochran, "Jerry's Jackets; or, Uncovering Jerry Todd: A Revealing Analysis," Yellowback Library, 35 (September/October 1986), 5-12 (on Leo Edward's juvenile Jerry Todd serits); and Keith Cushman, "Lawrence's Dust-Jackets: A Selection with Commentary," D. H. Lawrence Review, 28.1-2 (1999). are the show Alan Horne organized (drawing heavily on his own collection) for the Robarts Library of the University of Toronto in 1989, on "British Illustrated Book Jackets and Covers"; 15 15. Reviewed by Graham Bradshaw in "British Illustrated Book Jackets and Covers: A Report," Devil's Artisan, 25 (1989), 21-24. Horne later wrote a good brief account of jacket illustrators in a section of the introductory text to The Dictionary of Twentieth-Century British Book Illustrators (1994): "Book Jackets and Covers and Paperback Wrappers," pp. 34-46. a display of American pictorial jackets of the 1920-50 period at the Broward County (Florida) Main Library in January and February 1997 (accompanied by a small catalogue, Pictorial Covers, containing a "Brief History of the Book Jacket" by James A. Findlay, who treats this subject in more scholarly fashion than it usually receives); 16 16. Despite the awkward assertion that it was "not until the 1920s . . . that the modern book jacket became a staple of the publishing world." Jackets certainly were a staple of the publishing world earlier; but whether pre-1920 jackets are to be called "modern" is a matter of definition. an exhibition of "Australian Dustwrappers" at the 25th Australian Antiquarian Book Fair in Melbourne in 1998; and a gathering of jackets (again of 1920-50) on books with a Chicago connection, organized by the Caxton Club in 1999 (and documented in an attractive catalogue, Chicago under Wraps, with an introduction by Victor Margolin). At least two jacket designers, Gary G. Gore and Chip Kidd, have created exhibitions themselves and actively lectured about jackets. 17 17. A traveling exhibition of Gore's originated at Vanderbilt University in 1971, and he gave his illustrated talk on "The Dust Jacket in a Dustless Society" at various places. (The announcement of his appearance before the Pittsburgh Bibliophiles on 18 February 1971 noted, "Part of his slide presentation will show several possible versions of the jacket for one book, as designed to please the bibliophile, the author, the production manager, and the sales manager.") Gore published an article, "How I Design a Dust Jacket (When Dust Is a Secondary Consideration)," in Pages, 1 (1976), 238-241 (one reason for the jacket, he says, is "To exist as an art form" [p. 238]; publishers pay for jackets because "they can feel. Because they aren't selling deodorants—that's a book under the jacket" [p. 241]). Kidd's exhibition , "Mixing Messages," was held at the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York in 1998; his lecture at the Philadelphia College of Textiles &amp; Science on 24 March 1999 was made available by the College on a videocassette entitled Chip Kidd, Graphic Designer, Art Director, Writer (1999). An autobiographical essay by a designer is Michael Harvey's " Book-Jackets ," Matrix, 21 (2001), 117-125. Books on the principles of book design have long included discussions of jacket design: for example, there is a section on jackets in the various editions of Oliver Simon's Introduction to Typography (1945), Seán Jennett's The Making of Books (1951), and Hugh Williamson's Methods of Book Design (1956). Jackets also come up in such reference books as Harold Osborne's Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts (1975). If the preservation of jackets for their artistry is by now well established , there are of course many collectors whose primary interest is the verbal content of books rather than graphic art, and for them the reason for collecting jacketed copies of books is (or should be) simply the fact that books published in jackets are not in their original condition if they lack the jackets. We should expect, therefore, to find that introductory manuals for book-collectors contain a fuller rationale for collecting jackets than is provided in the books on the art of the jacket. But we would be disappointed by the books that appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, when there was a flurry of largely unfortunate guides. 18 18. I reviewed six of them from the 1970s in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 72 (1978), 265-281. The most absurd is Maurice Dunbar's Fundamentals of Book Collecting (1976). Although he is not alone in being uninformed about the early history of jackets (believing that publishers "did not begin the practice of issuing books with jackets until about the turn of the twentieth century" [p. 55]), his manual is the only one to recommend " improving " jackets that are in poor condition (they can often, he thinks, be "salvaged and improved to an astonishing degree" [p. 58]). The first step is to "place high grade drafting tape along the margins" (that is, the edges of the unprinted side); next one uses "a smooth porous-pointed pen to restore the original color"—the preferred pen being a Bic Banana Ink Crayon (p. 59). The idea that jackets are important underlies this silliness, but the author clearly has no understanding of what historical evidence means. When he revised his book in 1980 under the title Books and Collectors, the same advice is, incredibly, still present—though he must have received a few protests because he admits that dealers and curators "wince" at such recommendations. But he cannot comprehend why: "They believe that it is better to leave them [jackets] hanging in shreds" (p. 58). 19 19. Not every dealer was averse to Dunbar. Preston C. Beyer (Stratford, Conn.) included as an introduction to his catalogue 13 (1979) two pages of Dunbar's words on "The Dust Jacket." A more recent article on "Dust Wrapper Restoration," by Robin H. Smiley ( Firsts, June 2001, pp. 47-53), is marginally more responsible because it concedes that "once a wrapper has been restored, it is no longer genuine" and that restored jackets "must be clearly identified as such" when offered for sale; nevertheless, it unfortunately claims that "dust wrapper restoration is beginning to gain acceptance in the book collecting community " (p. 49), if undertaken by professional restorers who can return jackets to "collectable condition" (p. 53). The other introductory manuals of the time do not descend to this level, but invariably they are not fully satisfactory in their discussion of jackets. Seumas Stewart's Book Collecting: A Beginner's Guide (1972) defends the integrality of jackets to books by noting that reference to jacket designs may appear within books (pp. 251-252)—without saying that jackets are in any case part of what the publisher published. Catherine Porter, in Miller's Collecting Books (1975), after erroneously claiming that jackets were not "in common use in Britain or America until around 1910" (p. 51), warns collectors to "be wary of the exorbitant prices demanded for early dust-jackets" (pp. 62-63), without explaining the serious reasons that jackets are "now de rigeur " (p. 51) among collectors . Salvatore J. Iacone's The Pleasures of Book Collecting (1976) reasonably states that the presence of a jacket is of "paramount importance " because it is an integral part of the book (p. 42) but three pages later says, "If one is going to play the book collecting game, one must abide by the rules, one of the strangest and most unreasonable perhaps being the preference for dust jackets." G. L. Brook's Books and Book-Collecting (1980) asks, but does not answer, the question whether a book is complete without its jacket and then pointlessly asserts that publishers should never print on jackets any information that is not also included within the book (pp. 74-75). Robert A. Wilson's Modern Book Collecting (1980) takes for granted that jackets are important (pp. 99-102) and points out that a jacketed copy will sell for twice (and in some cases much more than twice) the price of an unjacketed copy; but he does not explain the reasons, which are obscured by his view that there is no harm in switching jackets from one copy to another. William Rees-Mogg, in How to Buy Rare Books (1985), similarly gives neophytes no idea of why the attention to jackets is more than a fad; anyone who believes that jacketed copies should not bring higher prices is going against the " consensus of opinion in today's market," he says, and "to disregard the sentiment of other collectors may be to throw your money away" (p. 67). 20 20. Two other such books of the period contain very brief references to jackets: Jack Tannen's How to Identify and Collect American First Editions (1976) simply says, "A jacket . . . will increase the price of a first edition many times over" (p. 16); and John Chidley's Discovering Book Collecting (1982) mentions a few designers and illustrators of jackets (p. 61). (Chidley published a somewhat longer discussion of jackets in October of the same year in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review ["Dust Jackets," 9: 376-377], where he recognizes that "The collector who really does want his first editions with the dust jackets now has logic on his side," only to undercut his point by declaring that "the sensible path to follow is one's own inclinations.") However unsatisfactory the treatment of jackets in these books, they at least show that jackets had become a topic that could not be ignored. And all the while, new printings and editions of Carter's ABC for Book-Collectors appeared, with a discussion of jackets that set a standard unequaled by the other books. Its original 1952 entry for "Dust-Jacket" 21 21. Carter's intelligent remarks on jackets go back at least twenty years before the ABC: in a letter to the Publisher &amp; Bookseller on 19 August 1932 (pp. 293-294), he pointed out—speaking of jackets—the need "to stimulate the necessary interest in the historical side of a very significant development of book structure and publishing practice." remained unchanged through the second (1953), third (1961, hardcover and paperback), and fourth (1966, 1967, 1971) editions. For the fifth edition in 1972, Carter made only minor adjustments, adding additional reasons for the importance of jackets (such as biographical information and photographs), along with a reference to my 1971 article. This succinct , sensible, knowledgeable, and witty account has stood the test of time and has remained unchanged through the three succeeding editions revised by Nicolas Barker. The commercial success of the ABC (with sixteen printings of its various editions called for between 1972 and 2005) suggests that more people—fortunately—have read about jackets in this book than in any other. 22 22. It is to be contrasted with what appeared in the last editions of books by Carter's friend P. H. Muir ( Book-Collecting as a Hobby, 1945) and his Scribner colleague David A. Randall (John T. Winterich and Randall's A Primer of Book Collecting, 1966), both of which assert that the jacket is not a part of the book (pp. 51-52 and p. 117). Herbert Faulkner West cited an earlier edition of Muir approvingly in Modern Book Collecting for the Impecunious Amateur (1936), pp. 35-36, referring to the "dust-jacket mania" and advising collectors not to pay "a sum incommensurate with the price of the paper for a dust wrapper." Those who wished to have a more detailed, yet reliable, introduction to all aspects of the subject had to wait until 1998, when Anthony Rota included an eighteen-page chapter on "Book-Jackets" in his Apart from the Text (pp. 124-141). Rota gives an accurate historical sketch of the evolution of the jacket from protective covering to marketing device, and he surveys the characteristics of the jackets of a number of twentieth-century British publishers, noting the artists and designers they employed . After mentioning other reasons for being interested in jackets— such as the "remarkable amount of information about authors" they may contain—he makes, and then elaborates on, a basic point: "Jackets are worthy of preservation and of study, even if they present nothing but the names of the author and the publisher, and the title, because even such scanty information may provide clues to prevailing literary taste, economic circumstances, or snippets of publishing history" (p. 134). Among other topics he treats are the writing of blurbs by prominent authors and the use of advertising bands occasionally placed around jackets ; and he recognizes that jackets are defective if prices have been clipped from them and that the switching of jackets is "tampering with bibliographical evidence" (p. 140). His enlightened approach is epitomized by the conclusion of the chapter: Most standard accounts of book publishing deal with jackets in a few paragraphs , as if they were of only marginal interest or importance. There is in fact a strong case for arguing that they are central to an understanding of the binding and marketing of books over the last two centuries, to the history of the individual books they envelop, and perhaps most intriguingly, as a reflection of changing tastes in the marketplace. For a general introduction to the subject, one can do no better than to turn to Rota's essay. 23 23. His comment about standard histories of publishing is borne out by John Tebbel's four-volume A History of Book Publishing in the United States (1972-81), where there are only a few scattered references to jackets (and the sheaths on annuals); see 1: 95, 96, 256, 257; 2: 164, 657, 660, 668; 3: 28, 326-328, 379, 445, 481; 4: 441, 442. Tebbel does, however, quote two interesting remarks on jackets in vol. 3 (covering 1920-40): a 1919 editorial in the New York Sun predicting jacket-collecting and a museum of jackets ("a Louvre whose walls will be hung with curious and artistic book coverings"), and a 1920 review by William Lyon Phelps complaining about jackets (Tebbel's quotations are from Publishers' Weekly reports in each case, the first from 95 [15 February 1919], 439, and the second from 97 [13 March 1920], 809). It is superior to what had appeared in the glossy book-collecting magazines, though Antiquarian Book Monthly Review did pay considerable attention to jackets, publishing two serious articles on the subject and a number of briefer comments in the 1970s and 1980s. The earlier of the articles, George Locke's "Dustwrappers &amp; Sundry Confusions" of March 1979 (6: 102-105), deals with the process of attempting to identify first-printing jackets when they are separated from the books, and it was the occasion for two important points to be made. One, expressed by Locke himself at the end of his article, is that "systematic bibliographical consideration of 20th century dustwrappers is long overdue." What this amounts to is a request for fuller treatment of jackets in descriptive bibliographies, including attention to how jackets on later printings differ from those on firsts, and there is no doubt that bibliographers should be urged to pursue and record jacket variations. The other point came in a letter written by Alan Smith after reading Locke's article and published in the May 1979 issue ("Jacket Conservation Year?", 6: 213). 24 24. Several other responses to the article appeared in the "Letters" department. In May (6: 212), Jeffrey Stern asks about the claim (made in Derek Hudson's 1954 biography of Lewis Carroll) that Carroll first suggested the addition of printing to jackets, in connection with The Hunting of the Snark in 1876. Stern's question whether anyone had found an earlier example was answered in the July (6: 299) and August (6: 346) issues by John Stephens and Fred Lake, both of whom cite my 1971 article. Another letter, from Peter E. Dyke in June (6: 259), mentions a 1945 jacket with printing on its reverse relating to a different book; and E. Davis in August (6: 346) points out that this practice was characteristic of (but not limited to) the Nelson firm. Smith calls the discarding of jackets "a refined form of vandalism" and finds it a "tragedy" that "most institutional libraries have perpetrated this particular crime" and have thus shirked "their obligation to students of the book"; he then calls for "a national archive of jackets," perhaps to be promoted during a "Jacket Conservation Year." One can only wish that these points about the preservation and recording of jackets had received wider attention, and everyone interested in book history should continue to publicize them. The other substantial article on jackets in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review came nearly a decade later, in December 1988, when John Miller published "The Book Jacket —Its Later Development &amp; Design" (15: 452-461), a thoughtful treatment of the gradual development of the marketing function of jackets, with comments on the practices of a number of publishers. 25 25. Miller also, in the early part of his article, summarizes the factors underlying the growth of printed jackets in the nineteenth century and discusses the role of decorated (attached) wrappers as an influence on pictorial jackets. Other articles in the magazine comment in passing on the early history of jackets: Eric Quayle's "The Evolution of Trade Bindings: Part 2" in September 1977 (4: 358-364) discusses the connection between the rise of jackets and the development of publishers' bindings and recognizes that jackets were not uncommon by the 1860s (p. 361); and Donald Weeks's "Carnan &amp; Stationers'; Almanacks &amp; Wrappers" in September 1989 (16: 332-341) regards the stitched printed wrappers on some early nineteenth-century almanacs as possible precursors of the printed jacket. (That a less enlightened view of jackets could also appear in this magazine is shown by John Turner's comment quoted in the text below at note 50.) Consciousness of book-jackets in the culture at large, beyond the restricted circle of the readers of book-collecting magazines, is shown by the way the subject erupts periodically in mass-circulation publications. To take the New York Times as an example, one may note that Walter Kerr's article on retaining jackets elicited a large response from readers. On 6 December 1978, Kerr published a piece called "Book Jackets Were Not Made for Stripping," in which he expresses his shock on learning that the celebrated editor Maxwell Perkins threw away jackets before shelving books. 26 26. A fact he had encountered in A. Scott Berg's Max Perkins: Editor of Genius (1978). Kerr himself had always kept them and had given his wife "a stern little lecture on the rectitude of preserving a book whole, pristine as the day it was born." His recognition that a book published in a jacket is not "whole" without it showed more understanding than many collectors and dealers displayed. And one of his editor-friends, he reported , saved jackets because of their artistry and the information on them. Six weeks later, on 23 January 1979, Kerr published another article ("Book Jackets: Other Readings"), expressing surprise at the quantity of mail he had received, which reveals that everyone in our "dust-jacket-conscious society" has "very firm thoughts on this particular subject." 27 27. He also comments on the collecting of jackets, citing the inevitable example of the price difference between unjacketed and jacketed copies of The Great Gatsby ($75, he says, versus $500). The New York Times Book Review gave attention to jacket blurbs by well-known authors on 23 July 1978, when William Cole wrote about his experiences in the publicity departments of Knopf and Simon &amp; Schuster ("The Blurb and I"), and on 8 December 1996, when Pico Iyer, citing many interesting examples, called the blurb "a wonderfully coded subset of literature, rich with as many subtexts as a Derridean anthology" and offering "an unrivaled glimpse into the literary pecking order" ("Jacketeering"). And Henry Petroski, the engineer who has written about lead pencils and bookshelves, explained his devotion to jackets (despite the fact that one more book for every forty could be shelved in the same space if the jackets were removed) because they are often better made than the books and "do not strike me," he says, "as ephemera." 28 28. "Dress for Success: The Dust Jacket as Art, Advertisement and Nuisance," 18 May 1986, p. 21; adapted from his book Beyond Engineering: Essays and Other Attempts to Figure without Equations (1986). Other instances of attention to jackets in the Times are Ed Reiter's profile of the numismatic publisher Sanford J. Durst, who regarded jackets as an expensive "frill" that are "ecologically wasteful" (13 January 1980), and Bruce McCall's parodic "Three Centuries of the Dust Jacket" (12 July 1998). (Another humorous piece, published elsewhere, is Robert Halsband's "Dust-Jackets to the Rescue," Scholarly Publishing , 9 [1977-78], 53-55, which describes his practice of giving away copies of the jackets of the books he wrote rather than the more expensive books themselves.) A publisher who had earlier expressed some of the same objections as Durst was Richard de la Mare of Faber &amp; Faber, who had said in his 1936 Dent Memorial Lecture ( A Publisher on Book Production ) that jackets were an "important, elaborate, not to say costly and embarrassing affair," the expense of which could be better allocated (pp. 41-42). Treatments of jackets were not entirely absent from scholarly journals in the post-1970 period. 29 29. One contribution to Quaerendo —A. S. A. Struik's "The Dust-Jacket: Cloth of Gold in the Auction Room," 28 (1998), 185-214 (originally published in Dutch in 1996)—will be discussed below (in part IV) for its primary element of interest (a survey of libraries). The article is additionally useful for its European perspective and its references to publications on European jackets; but its chronology of "important dates relating to the development of the dust-jacket" (pp. 192-195) was out of date at the time of publication. The European collecting of jackets can also be glimpsed in two English-language articles by the creators of two immense German collections, both international in their scope: Ludwig Bielschowsky, "On Collecting Book Jackets," Private Library [then enttitled PLA Quarterly ], 1.6 (May 1958), 66-68; and Curt Tillmann, "A Book-Jackets Collection" (trans. Philip Ward), Private Library, 4.6 (April 1963), 108-109. Tillmann's collection at that time amounted to some 42,000 examples, running "from the middle of the eighteenth century to the present day" and including four thousand German jackets of the period 1895-1914. Serif —the journal of the Kent State University Libraries—was in the 1970s particularly hospitable to the subject, as evidenced by Joan St.C. Crane's sixteen-part series called "Rare or Seldom-Seen Dust Jackets of American First Editions." In this series Crane gives detailed descriptions of "unusual, variant or rare" jackets, mostly from the Barrett Collection in the University of Virginia Library (where Crane was a staff member). What she accomplishes here is not only to place on record thorough descriptions of nearly a hundred scarce jackets from four decades (approximately 1890 to 1930) but also to set a model of what a careful description of a jacket should entail (involving quasi-facsimile transcriptions of texts and Centroid Color Chart designations of colors). All told, she takes up jackets for books by twelve authors, ranging from Bierce and Hearn to Hemingway and Faulkner, and fourteen of the jackets are from before 1901. Her admirable work supplements several author bibliographies and should be better known. 30 30. The citations for and contents of Crane's series are as follows: I.—7.2 (June 1970), 27-30 (Cather, 1905-15). II.—7.3 (September 1970), 70-73 (Cather, 1908-25). III.—7.4 (December 1970), 64-66 (Faulkner, 1924-27). IV.—8.1 (March 1971), 21-23 (Faulkner, 1929-31). V.—8.2 (June 1971), 27-28 (Cabell, Dos Passos, Frost). VI.—8.3 (September 1971), 29-31 (Hemingway, 1925-32). VII.—8.4 (December 1971), 29-31 (Hemingway, 1926-29). VIII [misnumbered "VII"].—9.1 (Spring 1972), 31-32 (Stephen Crane, 1895-1900).

XII.—10.2 (Summer 1973), 37-39 (Hearn, 1890-1904). XIII.—10.4 (Winter 1973), 35-37 (Sinclair Lewis, 1912-17). XIV.—11.1 (Spring 1974), 34-38 (Lewis, 1920-29). XV.—11.2 (Summer 1974), 39-40 (Jack London, 1902-07). XVI.—11.3 (Fall 1974), 56-57 (London, 1911-13). In addition to her series, Serif published two lists of pre-1901 jackets (one from Kent State, one from Ohio State) to supplement my 1971 list, an account of a 1791 printed covering, and a note on a scarce Gertrude Stein jacket. 31 31.

Isaac, writing in The Library in 1975 on "Some Early Book-Jackets" (5th ser., 30: 51-52), reported (and illustrated) three items from his own collection that provide early examples of several features. Two are jacketed books published by Reeves &amp; Turner (London), in 1873 and 1878, with the text of the jacket for the latter printed on the reverse of the jacket for the former; both carry advertising on the front and back, and Isaac notes that the "bibliographical information on the [1878] jacket [such as the size of the edition] is consistent neither with itself nor with that given on the copy" of the book. The third jacket, on Charles Hindley's The History of the Catnach Press (1886), displays twelve wood engravings, including five on the flaps. Twenty-five years later, B. J. McMullin contributed "Precursors of the `Dust Wrapper' " to the Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (24 [2000], 257-266), discussing both the cardboard sheaths that were common on the literary annuals of the 1820s and 1830s and the printed wrapping paper that is known to have been used, at least occasionally, in the 1830-60 period. 32 32. He also reflects on the origin of the inclusion of "dust" in the common name for book-jackets, noting that the top edge of the book, most vulnerable to dust, is not protected from dust in the form of the jacket that became standard. Besides reporting several of the former in Australian libraries, helping to confirm their regular use on this class of book, he explains that an 1860 example of the latter (on The Museum of Classical Antiquities, ed. Edward Falkener) shows— more clearly than had been known before—how such wrapping was originally sealed over the edges of books. 33 33. McMullin quotes a letter from the bookseller Peter Baring recalling an auction where twenty sealed copies of The Museum and eight of Falkener's Daedalus (1860) were consigned by the Falkener family. The wrappings on these copies, he reports, were torn open, and the few that were not destroyed were trimmed to approximate the form of the new-standard jacket. The ultimate test of the scholarly recognition of the importance of jackets is the kind of treatment they receive in descriptive bibliographies . Although a few instances of detailed description can be found in the 1930-70 period, there was also a reluctance to deal with jackets on the part of some bibliographers, who occasionally expressed their views with force in the pages of their bibliographies. 34 34. I have commented on the bibliographies of this period at the beginning of part III of my 1971 article. One not mentioned there is Percival Hinton's Eden Phillpotts (1931), which contains this comment: "I should like to have included in my collations of each book a description of the dust wrapper used, only it was impossible to obtain descriptions of all of them and they are rightly not regarded as an integral part of a book. If the modern use of them continues they will probably tend to become more definitely associated with the books they cover. Many of those used on Mr. Phillpotts's books have a decided interest. The wrapper for `The Bronze Venus' bore a reproduction of a bronze in the British Museum that suggested the story. `Redcliff' incorporated a reproduction of an old print shewing the particular place from which the novel drew its title" (p. vi). And this unfortunate tradition has lingered to mar the work of a few bibliographers of whom one would have expected better. Edwin Gilcher, for example, in his 1970 bibliography of George Moore, is defiantly assertive: "As dust jackets and slip cases can in no sense be considered an integral part of the books they serve to protect and can easily be switched from copy to copy, they are not noted in the descriptions" (p. xiii). Yet even Gilcher makes an exception, for an instance in which the jacket designer is named in the book; one would have thought that this exception might have caused Gilcher to begin rethinking his whole position, but it apparently did not. 35 35. Richard Fifoot did have second thoughts about omitting jackets from his 1963 Soho bibliography of the Sitwells; in his introductory comments to his 1971 revision, he calls this practice "an omission I have regretted since reading Sir Sacheverell Sitwell's `A Note for Bibliophiles' . . . which explains how personal are the wrappers of some of his books" (p. 9) —though Fifoot does not rectify the omission. (It was apparently Fifoot's comment that caused Sitwell to reprint the piece, slightly revised, as a separate; see note 60 below.) Equally disappointing is Dan H. Laurence's position in what is in many ways a major work, his bibliography of Bernard Shaw (1983). Despite his inclusion of a section of dust-jacket blurbs written by Shaw (pp. 851-860), he declines to make jacket descriptions a regular part of his treatment of Shaw's own books: Dust-wrappers have never figured notably in the collecting of Shaw's works, though most of his principal books have been issued in dust-wrappers since at least 1902. . . . Dust-wrappers are recorded only in those instances where Shaw either provided text, aided in the design, or commissioned and passed judgment on the finished dust-wrapper. (pp. xvi-xvii) This statement reflects the outmoded view of descriptive bibliographies as collectors' guides rather than publication histories. And in any case it can scarcely be true: surely the collectors of Shaw do not lag so far behind those of other authors that they have not come to prefer their author's books in jackets. Fortunately, disparagement of jackets by bibliographers has not been an influential attitude in recent years (hard as it is to believe that it exists at all). And because the majority of serious descriptive bibliographies of twentieth-century authors has appeared since 1970, one can now say that the standard treatment of jackets is acceptable (indeed, often admirable) in those bibliographies where the presence of detailed jacket descriptions makes the biggest impact. A helpful influence was the Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography, which began in 1972 with Joseph Schwartz and Robert C. Schweik's Hart Crane. The authors say, Dust jackets have been described in greater detail than is common and often in quasi-facsimile form; this procedure results not from any overestimation on our part of the importance of dust jacket evidences, but rather from the belief that the description, if provided at all, should be sufficiently precise so as to provide bibliographically useful information. (p. xxi) This somewhat apologetic statement was replaced in the next volume, Matthew J. Bruccoli's F. Scott Fitzgerald (1972), with the simple assertion that "Dust jackets for Section A entries have been described in detail because they are part of the orignal publication effort" (p. xx). This is all the justification required, and it was repeated in varying forms in most of the succeeding volumes of the series, which covered more than a dozen other twentieth-century writers. 36 36. Nor did the volumes on nineteenth-century authors neglect jackets: Joel Myerson, for example, recorded nineteenth-century jackets for Emerson (1982) and Emily Dickinson (1984). The main volumes of the Pittsburgh (and other) series are listed in section 4C of my Introduction to Bibliography: Seminar Syllabus (latest revision, 2002). The excellent example that had already been set by Joan St.C. Crane in her Serif articles (1970-74) may have played a role here; it certainly underlay her own admirable Robert Frost: A Descriptive Catalogue of Books and Manuscripts in the Clifton Waller Barrett Library, University of Virginia (1974), which in turn no doubt influenced the thorough jacket descriptions in another series, the Linton R. Massey Descriptive Bibliographies, published by the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia (including volumes on Burroughs, Bishop, Warren, and Jarrell). The Soho Bibliographies have not been consistent, but one that pays attention to jackets is Richard Lancelyn Green and John Michael Gibson's A. Conan Doyle (1983); and the St. Paul's Bibliographies have been similarly inconsistent, with brief jacket descriptions in Robert Cross and Ann Ravenscroft-Hulme's Vita Sackville-West (1999) and thorough ones in Gillian Fenwick's George Orwell (1998). Other bibliographies, not in series, have also sometimes been careful in their treatment of jackets: James L. W. West's Styron (1977) is an admirable instance, and Bradford Morrow and Bernard Lafourcade's Wyndham Lewis (1978) contains some seventy-five illustrations of jackets (because Lewis designed most of them). 37 37. R. A. Gekoski and P. A. Grogan's William Golding (1994) includes eighteen color illustrations of the fronts of jackets (but does not describe the jackets in the entries). Donald Gallup, author of respected bibliographies of Eliot and Pound, wrote in On Contemporary Bibliography (1970) that "the bibliographer should certainly describe them [jackets] when he comes across them"—though his own practice was to give only the colors of the paper and the printing, and nothing more. (His comments on the importance of jackets, with examples, are on pp. 11-13.) I need not cite more examples to make the point that descriptive bibliographers are increasingly cognizant of the necessity for including jacket descriptions in author bibliographies and that a large body of such descriptions is now in print. Because the entries for books in responsible descriptive bibliographies become the standard accounts of those books as physical objects, such bibliographies can play a powerful role in promoting widespread acceptance of the idea that jacket details are an expected, routine part of book descriptions , and thus that jackets are parts of books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II When we turn to the role that dealers have played in the dust-jacket story, pride of place goes to Ken Leach of Brattleboro, Vermont, who in the 1970s and early 1980s assembled, and then dispersed, the largest collection of pre-1901 jackets that has ever been formed (that is, since the days when they were current). In the first of his 1977 catalogues (77-1), he announced, "I am trying to build a collection of American books in their original DUST JACKETS published prior to 1900." After mentioning his two earliest (a printed envelope of 1848 and a regular jacket of 1876), he stated, "If anybody has any for sale I would like very much to hear about. Or if you have any information about any early ones I would like to hear about." By 6 February 1979, about two years later, he had accumulated 212 examples, and in a letter to me (enclosing a list of them) he said, "I am beginning to suspect that probably at least 90% of all books published after 1890 were issued in dust jackets"—a statement he publicly altered the next year by changing the date to "1880" in a letter he published in AB Bookman's Weekly. The purpose of his letter was to correct some errors in Adeline R. Tintner's article "Henry James Writes His Own Blurbs": he noted that decorative jackets appeared at least as early as 1878 (not 1902) and blurbs as early as 1880 (not 1906), citing examples. But he acknowledged that information of this kind was not readily available: "There are probably," he said, "not more than two or three actual collections in the world. But I can walk upstairs to my `collection room' and inspect the shelves that contain over 270 American books printed prior to 1900 in their original Dust Jackets." 38 38. Tintner's only source, as Leach noted, was Rosner's 1954 book; Leach added that my 1971 article was the only discussion of jackets not "written from catch-as-catch-can viewing." Leach's letter appeared in AB Bookman's Weekly, 65 (16 June 1980), 4642; Tintner's article was in the 19 May 1980 issue, pp. 3871-76 (under the heading "Dust Jacket Promotion"). A little more than a year later, in the fourth of his 1981 catalogues (81-4), Leach offered his whole collection, then numbering "over" 440 items, for sale as a lot for $21,500 (item 82). In his description, he called it (accurately) "the largest extant collection of its kind in the world," noted that it "had been about ten years in the building," and gave a correct idea of the "enormous amount of information contained in and on these jackets; the salesmanship (or lack of) of the publishers, the artists involved, the advertisement information, the decorations, etc, etc." He also astutely pointed out that the lot was "two collections in one": since the jackets had protected the bindings, it was also a collection of pristine examples of late nineteenth-century publishers' bindings. Despite these valid points and a listing of some high spots, 39 39. Including jacketed copies of Norris's 1899 McTeague ("which," he said, "has an appraised value of $1,000.00"); the 1892 edition of Parkman's The Oregon Trail, with illustrations by Remington; Remington's Crooked Trails (1898); and John Muir's Picturesque California (1888). the collection did not sell, and Leach wrote to me a year later (on 2 November 1982) asking for suggestions of possible purchasers. By that time, there were about 550 items, and the price was $26,000. Another year and a half passed, with no more success in placing the collection en bloc, and Leach decided to sell it at auction. On Sunday, 10 June 1984, at Hotel Northampton in Northampton, Massachusetts, Oinonen Book Auctions (of Sunderland, Massachusetts) offered as Sale No. 71 The Ken Leach Collection of Nineteenth Century American Books in Original Dust Jackets and Boxes. The sixty-page catalogue contains 608 lots arranged chronologically (and alphabetically by author within each year), with an author index. Since each entry includes some description of the binding and of the jacket (or box) and the name of the publisher, the catalogue is a useful reference tool, as Leach had hoped. In his introduction he says that the catalogue, which will " preserve a record of the collection as a whole," "should continue to provide a valuable sign-post for collectors." Another of his aims in selling at auction—"to establish a price guide for each individual item"—was more ambiguously realized, however, for a third of the lots failed to sell, even at the minimum bid of $5 (they were simply given to the successful bidder for the next lot sold), and books that were of little interest aside from their jackets fetched low prices (139 of them brought $5 apiece). 40 40. In many cases, the purchasers of these $5 items received two or more jackets (as many as five in two instances) because the preceding item(s) had failed to sell. Thus the idea of buying jackets primarily to document their history was not much in evidence in the saleroom, despite the example set by Leach himself. At the beginning of the auction, the entire collection was once more offered as a whole, with a reserve of $25,000, as stipulated in the catalogue , but there were no bidders. In the end, the sale realized a total of $18,632.50—an average of $46.58 for the four hundred lots that sold (or $26.29 if one eliminates the eleven items that brought more than $300). The highest price by far, $3400, was fetched by Norris's McTeague (1899), the other top prices being only in three figures: $700 for Stevenson and Osbourne's The Ebb-Tide of 1894 (the only Stone &amp; Kimball jacket known); $600 for F. O. C. Darley's Six Illustrations of Rip Van Winkle of 1848 (in a printed envelope); $575 for Muir's two-volume Picturesque California of 1888 (in unprinted buckram jackets); $400 for the 1877 edition of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, illustrated by Gustave Doré; $380 for Abraham Cahan's Yekl (1896); $310 for Remington's Crooked Trails (1898); and $350-$440 for three Stephen Crane titles, The Little Regiment (1896). The Third Violet (1897), and The Monster (1899). The only other price that was over $300—the second highest one, in fact, at $900—was for the only lot (no. 31) that did not contain a detachable covering: an album (dated as "collected circa 18811895") of some 250 "original printed proofs of illustrated covers and dust jackets" from the New York firm of A. Hilgenreiner, produced largely for the Century and Scribner publishing firms. The earliest item in the sale was the Darley Six Illustrations (1848), labeled "The earliest recorded American dust jacket" but more accurately described (in Leach's words from his note in catalogue 77-1) as a "printed envelope." The next five lots, from 1851 through 1870, were books in publishers' slip-cases, not jackets. The earliest jackets in the collection were from 1875, represented by three volumes in Scribner's "Bric-a-Brac Series," and only thirteen more lots were for books dated before 1880—including a presentation copy of the first volume of Charles B. Turrill's California Notes (1876), published by the celebrated Edward Bosqui (Leach called this lot "The first California dust jacket?", but it brought only $110). From 1880 on, the rapidly increasing number of lots per year reflected the relative availability of such jackets in general : figures ranged from six for 1880 to twenty for 1888, with the total for the 1880-89 period coming to 108. Thus of the 608 lots in the sale, all but 128 dated from 1890 or later (the number from 1899 alone was seventy). The catalogue therefore offers a good basis for making generalizations about the widespread use of jackets in America in the 1890s. But the range of features represented even in the relatively few pre-1890 examples is considerable. Leach's introduction, for instance, mentions the earliest use of color printing in the collection as from 1878 (for Bryant's The Flood of Years ) and the earliest blurbs as from 1880 (for Mary Russell Mitford's Our Village ). And the geographical spread before the early 1880s includes San Francisco, Richmond, Toronto, and Chicago, in addition to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Useful as the catalogue is, however, it does not come close to having the research value of the collection itself; the dispersal of so large a group of nine-teenth-century American jackets is indeed a setback for the study of this aspect of publishing history. Nevertheless, Leach's attentiveness to jackets was a notable contribution to the growing recognition of their historical value, which is a prerequisite to their preservation. Another dealer that has offered an unusual number of early jackets (though far fewer than Leach) is Wilder Books of Elmhurst, Illinois. In catalogue 9 (1984), for example, there were five nineteenth-century books in jackets, 41 41. Plus one more—a large-paper copy of Stevenson's Underwoods (1887)—in an unprinted (and thus not necessarily the publisher's) jacket (priced at $950); this copy reappeared in Wilder catalogue 15 (1985) at $450. all important but assigned prices that were high for the time (especially in light of those realized at the Leach sale the same year): Kate Greenaway's A Day in a Child's Life (1881), $850, and her Almanack for 1891, $675; Poe's Lenore (illustrated, 1886), $1750; Henry Demarest Lloyd's Wealth against Commonwealth (1894), $1250; and Hardy's Wessex Poems (1898), $3500. The following year, catalogue 15 opened with a section of thirty-nine items headed "Books in Dust Jackets , 1880-1900" (three of which were unprinted). All five from catalogue 9 reappeared here, and except for Wessex Poems they were listed at sharply reduced prices (the Lloyd, for instance, had dropped to $450). Twelve of the items were from the Leach sale, where none had sold for more than $100; their prices now ranged from $100 to $500 (Bellamy's Equality of 1897, for example, had gone up from $80 to $500). 42 42. S. Weir Mitchell's The Adventures of Francois (1898), which had fetched $17.50 at the Leach sale, had been listed in Wilder's catalogue 10 at $400 and now was lowered to $225. Two years later Wilder's List 87-A, consisting of sixty items, was entitled Books in Their Rare Original Dust Jackets, 1881-1915. Half the items predated 1901, but fourteen of them were brought forward from catalogue 15 (many at considerably reduced prices), 43 43. However, one—Irving's The Conquest of Granada (Handy Volume Edition, dated "ca. 1870's"—was increased from $45 to $150. and four came from the Leach sale; of those not previously listed, the most significant were E. W. Waterhouse's The Island of Anarchy (1887), known to science-fiction collectors, and Henry Blake Fuller's The Cliff Dwellers (1893), priced at $685 and $1025, respectively. The Wilder firm's continuing interest in jackets was further shown eight years later with its catalogue 72 (1995), entitled Books in Rare Original Dust Jackets, 1882-1923, though the proportion of pre-1901 printed jackets had declined to twenty out of fifty-three items. Of those, three still remained from the 1987 list, and two (not listed there) had been in the Leach sale. Notable jackets from the early years of the twentieth century should not be overlooked, such as the 1910 jacket reproducing Will Bradley's cover design for Walt Mason's Uncle Walt ($150), the 1910 jacket with a color illustration by Harrison Fisher on André Castaigne's The Bill-Toppers ($175), or the 1903 decorated jacket (possibly printed at the Merrymount Press, as the book was) on Helen Keller's Optimism ($250). Other Wilder catalogues have listed early jackets from time to time, and at least one of them, number 61 (1993), had nine entries for pre-1901 items, including an 1827 slip-case for the 1828 volume of Forget Me Not. The English dealer George Locke also deserves to be singled out for his attention to early jackets. A collector of science fiction and fantasy literature, he sells and publishes books under the firm name Ferret Fantasy, and in February 1988 he published a catalogue entitled Thirty Years of Dustwrappers 1884-1914. It is a sale catalogue only in part, for about half of the 159 items are unpriced, marked "NFS" (not for sale). The primary purpose of the catalogue (inspired, he says in his introduction , by his purchase of two dozen jacketed books at an Edinburgh auction in October 1987) is "to describe a number of dustwrappers of English language books published during the 30 years prior to the first world war." Each entry, besides describing the binding, gives a detailed acount of the jacket, often ending with interesting observations. 44 44. For eample, the "Remarks" section in the first entry, for an 1886 book with a pictorial jacket, notes (among other things) that pictorial jackets not repeating the binding design seem to be "uncommon before 1900, but occur more frequently with children's and illustrated books." Altogether the catalogue contains thirty-four entries for pre-1901 jackets, five of them for 1880s books, including the twenty-five-volume Centenary Edition of Scott's Waverley Novels (1885-88, £385). The prices for individual nineteenth-century jacketed books (as opposed to the Scott set) range from £15 to £350 (for George MacDonald's Phantastes of 1894). Early jackets also turn up in other Locke catalogues, such as Q88 (January 1990), which lists an 1886 Jules Verne item. Locke's interest in jackets has not been limited to the pre-1915 period, however. In the summer of 1978 he purchased, from Picture Books of Brighton, a group of about three hundred jackets from the 1920s and 1930s (jackets only, without the books) that had come from a rental library. His account of the process of cataloguing them 45 45. Another example of a dealer who has catalogued jackets by themselves (at least in one catalogue) is Thomas Boss, whose List 984 (1998) contains entries (41, 42) for two jackets (from 1929-30) with illustrations by Alastair. (in the Antiquarian Book Monthly Review article mentioned earlier) is a good outline of some of the clues (such as prices, blurbs, and the dates of other titles) that must be investigated to determine whether a given jacket is consistent with what could have appeared on the earliest copies of the book or whether it is clearly a later printing. Even in the extensive index to his three-volume catalogue of his own collection ( A Spectrum of Fantasy, 1980-2002), he uses a symbol to mark each pre-1941 title for which he has a jacket. Many other dealers, of course, call attention to early jackets when they have them for sale, generally placing a heading (like "In the Rare Original Jacket") above the relevant entries in their catalogues. 46 46. The names of some of these dealers can be located in the index to the appended list. One unusual instance is Hordern House's 1999 catalogue offering (as item 43) Ernest Giles's Australia Twice Traversed (2 vols., 1889) at $17,500: a full-page description, including a discussion of the history of dust-jackets (headed "UNRECORDED DUSTJACKETS" and quoting my 1971 article), is accompanied by a full-page illustration of the pictorial jackets on this set. Another example of an entry that goes into the history of jackets is in Rulon-Miller Books catalogue 88 (1988): item 151, for Howells's No Love Lost (1869), is headed "Third Earliest American Dust-Jacket Extant" (priced at $3500; relisted at that price in catalogue 92 [1990], item 108). Priscilla Juvelis's catalogues have included an uncommon number of early jackets: her List 97-3 (1997), for example, contains six nineteenth-century examples. And at least one such dealer, Kevin Mac Donnell (of Austin, Texas), who has handled a hundred or more nineteenth-century jackets over the years, has been assembling pre-World War I jacketed books to form a special catalogue. 47 47. I am grateful to him for providing me with a list of many of the jackets and slipcases that have passed through his hands or are currently in his stock. His interest in the s ubject is also shown by two articles (based on his own collections) that he wrote for Firsts, which include discussions and illustrations of several examples: "Collecting Mark Twain," 8.7/8 (July/August 1998), 24-61; "American Gift Books," 11.10 (December 2001), 26-51. For dealers in twentieth-century first printings, jackets have for many years been a major concern; 48 48. One prominent dealer in modern firsts, the late Marguerite Cohn, is supposed to have suggested that her epitaph might say, "Margie Cohn died worrying about dust jackets" (reported by Gordon Hollis in the article cited in note 55 below). and it is no longer uncommon to find such dealers' booths at book fairs stocked exclusively (or nearly so) with books in jackets. Because dealers who list books on the internet often provide images, their websites constitute a large (though uncoordinated and impermanent) archive of illustrations of jackets. 49 49. An example of a website showing thousands of jackets is the one maintained by Between the Covers (Merchantville, N.J.): &lt;http://www.betweenthecovers.com&gt;. One of the major firms specializing in modern firsts, Bertram Rota Ltd., has been a leader in the responsible handling of jackets, as Anthony Rota's admirable 1998 essay on "Book-Jackets" (in Apart from the Text, mentioned above) shows. The Rota firm, indeed, has sometimes been taken to task by those who do not understand the significance of jackets: John Turner, for instance, in his April 1977 column for Antiquarian Book Monthly Review, claims that a Rota catalogue shows how "this rather odd phenomena [of valuing jackets] may have taken root, or is perhaps being nurtured, in this country and not exclusively in the U.S.A." (4: 161). 50 50. Another article critical of the pricing of scarce jackets in general is Jim McCue's "Judging Books by Their Cover," London in June [ The Times ], June 1999, p. 6. Dealers who take jackets seriously (like the Rota firm) condemn the practice of switching jackets as a violation of bibliographical evidence (a point Anthony Rota makes explicitly); and one is therefore not surprised to see that his son Julian has recently chaired an Antiquarian Booksellers Association subcommittee to consider refinements in the organization's "Terms of the Trade," including the matter of replacing jackets. Although Julian Rota's position is the same as his father's, 51 51. As is the subcommittee's, according to Rota's letter in the Bookdealer, 27 January 2005, p. 10. the work of his subcommittee has occasioned considerable debate, first within the ABA leadership in late 2004 and then, in early 2005, in the pages of the Bookdealer. On 6 January 2005 the Bookdealer printed (under the heading "Code of Good Practice") a letter from Jonathan Potter, president of ABA, stating that "the Association is now recommending that its members indicate clearly not only any variance in condition between the book and wrapper, but, where applicable, to state that a wrapper has been supplied from another copy" (p. 9). Two weeks later (20 January 2005) James Fergusson devoted much of his column ("Catalogue Review") to arguing that switching jackets produces "a sort of forgery" and to criticize Potter's statement: "it is surely shocking," Fergusson says, "that the ABA should appear to be condoning or at least licensing the sophistication of modern first editions." Rather than implying that dealers may switch jackets so long as they state the fact, the ABA should, Fergusson says, "be purist in its insistence on authenticity, it should be rigorous about original condition, it should stand up for bibliographical truth" (p. 10). This forceful and admirable statement was echoed by another dealer the following week (27 January 2005): Laurence Worms said, "The switching of dust-jackets can never be a responsible practice, whether declared or not" (p. 8), and he added (p. 10) that "the bookseller's bibliographical duty of care in these matters is actually more important on the humble and humdrum books that (as yet or perhaps for ever) fall outside the scope of the full-scale bibliographies" (which offer "the protection of some other documentation or evidence"). And Potter himself wrote to affirm that "dust-wrappers must be considered an integral part of a book" (p. 10). This whole exchange, and its extension in the ensuing weeks, 52 52. In the number for 3 February 2005, for example, Fergusson again criticized the ABA for thus far not taking a strong enough stand; the organization, he says, should be " straightforwardly banning a practice which seems, on the face of it, as fishy as the Ring" (p. 14). Six weeks later the discussion was continued, rather aimlessly, by Robert Brown ("A Bookseller's Ramblings on the Sophisticated Book," 17 March 2005, pp. 7-9): after several disparaging references to the prices of jacketed copies (for those who "have the money to indulge in collecting pieces of printed paper at hundreds of pounds per square inch"), he suggests taking the position, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that any "book and jacket . . . cannot be assumed to have met before arriving in the shop, book fair or saleroom" (p. 9). (I am indebted to David McKitterick for calling my attention to the Bookdealer exchange.) gives welcome publicity, in a journal aimed at a booktrade audience, to the fact that switching (or "enhancing") jackets is as serious a bibliographical offense as inserting or replacing a leaf within a book. If jackets are both important and scarce, as well as being integral parts of the books they cover, one should expect them to command high prices. Anthony Rota once said, after explaining the significance of jackets, "For all these reasons my firm has always preached that it was worth paying a premium to buy a copy in the dustjacket as opposed to one that lacked it." 53 53. Though he has also said that "the price differential between books with and without their dustjackets has now reached seemingly absurd levels." See "Trends in the International Antiquarian Trade," AB Bookman's Weekly, 88 (16 September 1991), 993-1011 (quotations from p. 1002). That the market has followed this dictum in recent decades is unquestionable, and one regularly sees notable instances cited —such as the 1982 auction prices of £75 and £500 for an unjacketed and a jacketed copy of Ian Fleming's Casino Royale (1953); Biblioctopus's 1984 price of $17,000 for The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1891) in jacket; the 1986 auction price of £2600 for Kipling's Just So Stories (1902) in jacket (called by Sotheby's "the highest auction price, we believe , for a dust-jacket; the book on its own being worth about £100"); and the 1999 auction price of £80,700 for Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) in jacket. 54 54. These examples were cited, respectively, in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review, 9 (October 1982), 376 (by John Chidley); ibid., 11 (October 1984), 410; Sotheby's Market Report on Printed Books, Autograph Letters and Manuscripts in London, 1986, p. 1; and Jim McCue (see note 50 above). F. Scott Fitzgerald jackets have become celebrated for their high prices, but in fact jacketed copies of books by all the major authors of the 1920s and 1930s have been steadily rising for many years. Twenty years ago, for instance, Pepper &amp; Stern (in their List N) asked $7500 for a jacketed copy of Faulkner's Soldier's Pay 926); but at any book fair today one can see a considerable number of jacketed copies of books from this period priced in five figures. Dealers have often made generalizations about the percentage rise in price that a jacket brings about. Allen Ahearn, in The Book of First Books (1975), for example, stated, "On the average the presence of a dust wrapper will increase the value of a book by 50%. On books 20 years old or older the average increase in value added by the dust wrapper would be closer to 100% providing the dw is in fine condition," though he added that for Fitzgerald books the figure would be 300-400% (p. 6). Eight years later the Los Angeles dealer Gordon Hollis was of the opinion that "when a desirable pre-1925 book has its jacket, it is worth 10 to 15 times more than a copy without the jacket" (and a post-1925 book is "next to worthless without its jacket"). 55 55. "The Importance of the Dust Jacket" [with the heading "Pricing Factor" above this title], AB Bookman's Weekly, 72 (5 December 1983), 3891-3902 passim (quotation from p. 3891). Some dealers have even worked out charts to summarize the price levels under varying circumstances, 56 56. For example, see D. W. Howard and Ralph Roberts, "Dust Jackets," Book-Mart, 7.5 (January 1984), 21, 26, 30-31; and the table of prices that The Book Baron (Anaheim) would pay for Alcoholics Anonymous books ( AB Bookman's Weekly, 84 [6 November 1989], 1775). but such attempts at precision can never be more than vaguely indicative. Whether jackets are worth the large premium often asked for them is one of the most ubiquitous topics that jackets have generated, and one of the silliest. If the price difference between an unjacketed and jacketed copy of a book is, say, $500, it is pointless to claim, as some purchasers complainingly do, that the jacket has cost them $500. The truth is that the unjacketed copy is simply a defective copy; and the higher price is what is required (taking the usual factors into account) to buy a perfect copy. Even if one, illogically, were to think of jackets as separate items, there would still be no grounds for complaining about high prices, for jackets would then have to be compared with so-called ephemera, and important ephemera of all classes always bring high prices, given their rarity. Indeed, one should be surprised not at how expensive some jacketed books are but rather at the fact that, in light of their historical significance and their scarcity, they are not more expensive. Gordon Hollis, in his excellent discussion of the reasons that justify high prices for jacketed books, points out that jackets add significantly to the prices only of those books that would bring relatively high prices even without jackets. Then he adds, This standard may change if, in the future, the collector comes to value any early dust jacket the way we today value any incunabulum; it may change if we begin to fancy dust jacket art and come to collect `art deco' or `jazz age' jackets; it may change if we start collecting jackets with blurbs written by collected authors, no matter where those blurbs appear. (p. 3891) Dealers can play a leading role in bringing this desirable change about. They cannot of course afford to set prices that customers will not pay; but they do play an important role in educating collectors, and the respect they give to jackets, manifested in the prices they ask, is a part of the process. Prices support preservation, for items not widely perceived to be valuable are less likely to be taken care of, and dealers have already had a major influence on the preservation of jackets. The pricing of reputable dealers reflects an expert assessment of authenticity, which is complicated in the case of jackets by their detachability . But this problem, though perhaps different in degree, is certainly no different in kind from the task of critically examining every other feature of books. One point that did not emerge explicitly from the Bookdealer exchange is that a distinction must be made between dealers' own switching of jackets and their selling of books that came to them with switched jackets. The former should be absolutely forbidden; it should be considered a practice that no responsible dealer ought ever to engage in. But the latter is impossible to avoid because the changing of jackets has long been widespread, and still is. Every jacket encountered on a book should be initially regarded with suspicion , until a close inspection leads to the conclusion that the jacket is not inconsistent with what could have originally been present on that copy— which is the most one can ever say. 57 57. This is true even in those instances where one can turn to a good descriptive bibliography for guidance. If the jacket one is examining exactly matches a responsible bibliographer's description, one has strong support for treating it as original to the edition or printing in question (just as if one had seen the same jacket on multiple copies oneself), but not necessarily original to the particular copy in hand. If it does not match, it may nevertheless be original, for it may be a variant not seen by the bibliographer. One should also keep in mind that publishers sometimes use up a particular batch of jackets by placing them on copies of printings (or, less often, editions) for which they were not originally intended. A rare situation in which switched jackets would be easy to detect is illustrated by Charles Sanford Diehl's The Staff Correspondent (San Antonio: Clegg, 1931): not only are the copies of this limited edition individually numbered, but the jackets are numbered as well. When dealers find that books in their stock are wearing switched (or probably switched) jackets, they should annotate those books accordingly and report the information in their catalogue entries, just as they would do with any other defects they have discovered. Some mistakes will of course be made, but the goal must always be to present as accurate an assessment as possible of the status of each book in every respect. Once jackets are understood to be an integral element in what "original condition" means, all the rest— both pricing and commentary—follows as a matter of course. The professionalism of dealers requires that they (along with other bibliographical scholars) set an example of how jackets should be approached as historical evidence, just as they have regularly treated other aspects of books in this way. And there are many dealers who have indeed already shown this sense of responsibility and thus have invigorated the study of jackets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Everyone who has ever seen a publisher's book-jacket—and thus virtually everyone—knows that such jackets usually carry both a design (however minimal in some cases) and information. Although not everyone is necessarily interested in either of these aspects of a jacket's content, both constitute historical documentation and offer ample reasons for the importance of jackets and the desirability of preserving them. A jacket's design may be spare or elaborate; it may display only words (in typography or calligraphy) or words in combination with decorations or illustrations. Whatever the design, it shows something of the publisher's taste and of the style of the times, and it may in addition display the work of interesting or significant designers and illustrators. As for the more overtly informational content of jackets, there are several noteworthy categories: (1) commentary on the book, in the form of signed "blurbs" (by the author or by other writers) or unsigned sentences or paragraphs of description and praise (generally written by the publishing-house staff); (2) biographical information about the author, including photographs, lists of books, and summaries of dates and events; and (3) details of publication history, relating both to the specific book (such as the price, the size or date of the printing, or a date or name that supplements or clarifies what is provided within the book) and to other books (such as notices of related books recently published or, in the case of books in series, lists and serial numbers of other titles in the series). Besides these specific items of documentation, all of them taken together help to document the publisher's approach to advertising. In my 1971 essay I gave many examples of these various means by which jackets preserve notable content. To underscore the value of jackets as historical documentation, I shall simply note here a few further examples. In regard to typographic design, one need only mention Berthold Wolpe's jackets for Faber &amp; Faber and Stanley Morison's for Victor Gollancz 58 58. The importance of Morison's work for Gollancz is discussed in Sheila Hodges, Gollancz: The Story of a Publishing House, 1928-1978 (1978, in a jacket designed by Wolpe), pp. 29-30: "Together Morison and Victor [Gollancz] evolved a form of typographical jacket design that became one of the most brilliant and successful innovations in publishing in this century." to make the point that the full picture of these major figures' accomplishment requires access to jackets. The same can be said of the designer-illustrator Warren Chappell, as David L. Vander Meulen has demonstrated in his comprehensive collection, with its rows of jacketed copies. He has made the point 59 59. In an illustrated lecture given in Charlottesville (for the Bibliographical Society in March 2004 and Rare Book School in June and July 2004) and in New York (for the Typophiles in December 2004 and the Grolier Club in January 2005). that a large number of Chappell's designs, because they were on popular books and therefore can be found in many people's houses, have become part of the stock of imagery known to a mass audience, including persons not particularly alert to graphic art—a point that applies equally to the yellow Gollancz jackets and many other famous designs. Some of Vanessa Bell's decorations for Hogarth Press books appear on jackets; and John Minton's illustrative jackets for John Lehmann, Rex Whistler's and John Piper's for Faber &amp; Faber, and Brian Cook's for Batsford suggest the quality of the artwork that can be found on jackets. The drawings by Irene Hawkins for Sacheverell Sitwell's books were overseen by Sitwell himself, who went so far as to claim that "they are perhaps an unique instance of careful collaboration between an author and an artist." 60 60. In A Note for Bibliophiles (1976), a revised version of an essay that first appeared in Cameo, 1 (Spring 1954), 76-85. On the opening page, he also laments the fragility of jackets ("unspoilt copies of them are now very difficult to find") and states, "The degree of care and trouble put into their preparation by both artist and author should make them, I hope, more deserving of attention than much of the ephemera of the day and year." See also note 35 above. The illustrations on jackets sometimes do not appear within the books themselves, a situation that Brian Alderson has noted as a fairly common one in connection with children's books. 61 61. "Bibliography and Children's Books: The Present Position," Library, 5th ser., 32 (1977), 203-213 (see p. 212, where he says that the jacket "may often extend by one or more illustrations—usually in color—the illustrator's contribution to the book"). Jackets may also include illustrations not specifically created for these jackets: the one on the American edition of Pio Baroja's Weeds (Knopf, 1923), for instance, displays a painting by John Dos Passos (as well as a blurb by him). Nineteenth-century jackets are not normally associated with specific designers (understandably, given their generally sparse layout), but sometimes the designer can be identified: for example, The Pageant of 1897 (published by Henry &amp; Co. of London) notes on the leaf following the title-leaf, "The outer wrapper is designed by Gleeson White." Although the designers of the decorative bindings of the 1880-1910 period have received a great deal of attention, there is a tendency to ignore the jackets that frequently covered those bindings, since they were often very plain, but sometimes they reproduce the binding designs. Thus Charles Gullans and John Espey's Margaret Armstrong and American Trade Bindings (1991) gives almost no notice to jackets; but Eunice R. Schwager's notable collection of Armstrong, which contains jackets for thirty-seven titles, 62 62. There are many more jackets in her collection, counting all those on successive printings of particular titles. Most of Ethel Reed's many books and a few others with Armstrong bindings were also published in boxes carrying her binding designs; the Schwager collection has fourteen titles in boxes. shows that contemporary book-buyers would have encountered many of Armstrong's designs first in their usually single-color and sometimes abbreviated form before experiencing their full splendor on the covers beneath. She obviously did not intend her designs specifically for jackets, but one cannot fully gauge the presentation and influence of those designs without taking the jackets into account. Other binding designs by well-known designers of the great period of publishers' bindings also were repeated on jackets, along with their monograms: examples are W. Reader's design for Andrew Lang's Johnny Nut and the Golden Goose (Longmans, Green, 1887), Laurence Housman's for Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market (Macmillan, 1893), Elihu Vedder's for the Rubaiyat (3rd Houghton Mifflin edition, 1894), Amy Sacker's for Louisa May Alcott's A Hole in the Wall (Little, Brown, 1899), and Ernest Seton Thompson's for Frank M. Chapman's Bird Life (Appleton, 1899). In the case of the American edition of Kipling's The Seven Seas (Appleton, 1896; noted on the 1899 printing), the designer's initials appear on the jacket but not on the same design on the cover of the book. 63 63. Any serious collector of nineteenth-century publishers' bindings, from any part of the century, is likely to amass in the process a collection of jackets as well: Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin, whose major collection of bindings is the basis for their The Art of Publishers' Bookbindings 1815-1915 (2000), have nearly a hundred nineteenth-century printed jackets and slip-cases (counting continental European examples as well as British and American ones). (I am grateful to Levin for providing me with his and Morris's thorough catalogue entries for these jackets and slip-cases.) Turning to the explicitly informational content of jackets, we may note that the importance of blurbs has been recognized by at least one collected edition: in 1980 the Pterodactyl Press of San Francisco published a volume of Carl Van Vechten's blurbs for his own books ( Ex Libris, edited by Paul Padgette and Bruce Kellner). This book reminds one of the value of attempting to discover the authorship of unsigned commentary, since it may be by the author or by a well-known member of the publisher's staff. 64 64. One of the most famous staff-writers of blurbs is T. S. Eliot, who wrote them for many Faber &amp; Faber books. In the Hand-List of the Literary Manuscripts in the T. S. Eliot Collection Bequeathed to King's College, Cambridge by John Davy Hayward in 1965 (1973), entry P40 records three Faber catalogues marked by Eliot to indicate his authorship of some of the comments, along with a copy of the Faber edition of William Saroyan's Get Away Old Man (1946) inscribed by Eliot to Hayward with the words "Signed for you by the blurb writer" (p. 19). Sometimes it offers a useful supplement to the book, as in the case of the 1881 American edition of Disraeli's Endymion (Chicago: Belford, Clarke), where the front of the jacket includes a key to the characters of the novel; or the Fugitive anthology Driftwood Flames (Nashville: Poetry Guild, 1923), where the front flap prints a concise summary of what the Fugitives stood for; or Kenneth H. Myers's SRDS: The National Authority Serving the Media-Buying Function (Northwestern University Press, 1968), where the jacket flaps carry an "Addendum" bringing the story to January 1969. 65 65. A special case of writing by the author on a jacket is the reproduction of part of Hardy's manuscript on the front of the jacket for The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall (London: Macmillan, 1923). Among the innumerable examples of signed blurbs by famous authors, I shall simply note that the publisher B. W. Huebsch, whose jackets were usually fairly sedate, went all out to promote Roger L. Sergel's Arlie Gelston (1923) by lining up blurbs from Sherwood Anderson, Ben Hecht, and Theodore Dreiser. This combination can symbolize the groupings of signed blurbs on many thousands of other books and can suggest the ways in which literary reputations, friendships, and rivalries are reflected on the surfaces of book-jackets. The more straightforwardly biographical information on jackets can also be revealing, since the details included in biographical sketches are likely to have been selected by the authors— or written by them, as in the case of Michael Sadleir's signed two- paragraph statement about "the chief influences" on his work for the jacket on the American edition of Forlorn Sunset (Farrar, Straus, 1946), which also includes a picture of him. Indeed, photographic portraits and drawings of authors (sometimes not easy to locate elsewhere) are often striking supplements to other biographical details. One thinks of the famous photographs of Truman Capote and Gore Vidal, but of course there are thousands of less well known instances that are equally communicative of the author's character . A few of my favorites are the photograph of May Sarton by Jill Krementz (different from the one used as the frontispiece) on the jacket for Sarton's A World of Light (Norton, 1978); the Leon Kroll drawing of Nancy Hale on the jacket for Hale's The Prodigal Women (Scribner, 1942) and the Rollie McKenna photograph of her on Black Summer (Little, Brown, 1963); and the drawing of David McCord by Grace Thayer Richards (Mrs. James Bryant Conant) on the jacket of McCord's In Sight of Sever (Harvard, 1963). If one lines up Wright Morris's novels, one has a whole portrait gallery, for nearly every one displays a different jacket photograph—sometimes taken by Morris himself, as on The Works of Love (Knopf, 1952) and Ceremony in Lone Tree (Atheneum, 1960). A picture on the jacket for one of an author's books may also be relevant to the reading of another one. As David L. Vander Meulen has reported to me from his Peter De Vries collection, Henry A. Hagel's photograph of De Vries on the back of the jacket for Comfort Me with Apples (Little, Brown, 1956) includes De Vries's daughter Emily, whose death from leukemia in 1960 provided the backdrop for The Blood of the Lamb (1962). All these photographs are on back panels; but B. W. Huebsch placed a photograph of Joyce on the front panel of the jacket for his edition (1918) of Chamber Music. The effect that jacket portraits can have on readers is suggested by a comment of Ted Morgan's in Churchill: Young Man in a Hurry, 1874-1915 (1982): "On the jacket [for Churchill's The Story of the Malakand Field Force (1898)] was a pensive young man with thinning hair who, dressed in a morning coat with silk lapels, did not look in the least like the officer on active duty whose experiences the book recounted" (p. 93). The usefulness of jackets in reconstructing a book's publication and marketing history is illustrated by instances of variant jackets. The first jacket, in three colors, for J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey (Little, Brown, 1961) was disapproved of by Salinger, and a new one was designed . Frank Conroy's The Disinherited (Covici, Friede, 1933) appeared in a jacket with an illustration on the front and another jacket with blurbs by Whit Burnett and Erskine Caldwell, among others. Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel (Scribner, 1929) also had its first jacket replaced with one quoting from reviews; and two jackets have been recorded for Jack Kerouac's On the Road (Viking, 1957) and for Twelve Poets: A Miscellany of New Verse (Selwyn &amp; Blount, 1918). An unusual instance is Paul Goodman's Stop-Light: Five Dance Poems (Harrington Park, N.J.: 5 × 8 Press, 1941): some copies carry a later jacket, the front flap of which reports new information, introduced by the words "Being obliged to replace lost dust jackets we now may note that . . . ." The survival of proof states of jackets may also preserve variants, as in the case of advance unbound copies of Thomas Pynchon's Slow Learner (Little, Brown, 1984) covered with proof jackets. Discovery of some of these variants has been facilitated by the fortuitous existence of copies of the books carrying both jackets; 66 66. In three of these examples: the double-jacketed Salinger was listed in In Our Time Catalogue 65 (April 1976), item 78 ($300), where it was called "the only copy to appear on the market"; the Conroy showed up in Gotham Book Mart Quick List 78, item 27 ($100); and the Kerouac was in the Goodwin sale (cited by George Bixby in "First Editions," Book Collector's Market, 3.4/5 [September/October 1978], 30-31). As for the Wolfe, Jeffrey Thomas's catalogue 1 (1982) offered a copy in the "first state" of the jacket (item 49, $900); the Twelve Poets was listed in G. F. Sims's catalogue 93 (1976), item 146 (which says that only twelve copies came out in the original jacket, with its typographical error); the Goodman was brought to my attention by the late Richard Colles Johnson; and the Pynchon was listed in Waiting for Godot Books catalogue 37 (1998), item 1553 ($1500). but there are other instances in which books were intended to be clothed in two jackets simultaneously at the time of publication. The second volume of the Parke-Bernet catalogue for the A. Edward Newton sale (1941), for example, was published with two jackets, the one underneath being a replacement for the original first-volume jacket; a printed notice in the second volume states that the original jacket was "not substantial enough to withstand the amount of handling to which the book is exposed." And Alexander King's Mine Enemy Grows Older (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1958) has an outer jacket that includes the following comment: "If this jacket (the author painted it) is too strong for you, take it off. There's a conservative jacket for conservative people underneath." Purchasers of Billy Graham's Just as I Am (Harper/Zondervan, 1997) were offered a similar choice, except that the alternative jackets were not on the same copies but rather were displayed together in bookstores and pictured side by side in advertisements: one showed Graham (both on the front and on the spine) in a suit and tie, whereas the other depicted him in a frayed denim shirt open at the throat. 67 67. An advertisement showing both jackets is in Christianity Today, 16 June 1997, p. 7. I am grateful to David L. Vander Meulen and Elizabeth Lynch for providing the information about the Graham book. (In the Newton and the King instances , by the way, and perhaps in the Graham as well, there is the implied expectation that the books will be kept in jackets.) When a later printing of a jacket appears on a first printing of a book, there is normally good reason to be suspicious, but not always: some copies of the first printing of the American edition of Dylan Thomas's Collected Poems (New Directions, 1953) bear a second-printing jacket (so labeled), but at least one copy is known to have a letter from the publisher laid in, stating that "we simply ran short of jackets." 68 68. Such a copy is listed in Van Allen Bradley's catalogue 44 (1977), item 552. A similar situation was reported to me by John Lancaster: the Holt firm about 1990 had on hand nine copies of the sixth printing of Robert Frost's 1930 Collected Poems, two of which wore an earlier form of the jacket and the other seven a later form. Sometimes information appears on the inside (or reverse) surface of jackets, in addition to the familiar use of that space to list titles in a series. 69 69. The reverse was also sometimes used to print the jacket text for a different book—a paper-saving practice especially employed during World War II. (See also note 24 above.) The inside of the jacket for Bruce Palmer's novel of the Spanish Civil War, They Shall Not Pass (Doubleday, 1971), prints sketches and brief descriptions of seven major characters in the book. And readers' comments on Humphrey Cobb's Paths of Glory (Viking, 1935) appear on the inside of the jacket. Instances of cross-references between the jacket and the book can go both ways: the verso of the title leaf of William Verral's The Cook's Paradise (London: Sylvan Press, 1948) notes an error on the jacket, whereas the jacket for John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman (Cape, 1969) states, "The author and the publisher assure the reader that there are no pagination errors in the final chapter of this story." Among the kinds of information that may appear only on the jacket, the publisher's name is one of the most surprising; but the Golden Hind Press reprint of the Biblion Society's 1927 Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta (Boccaccio) mentions the Golden Hind Press only on the jacket. 70 70. The Verral example comes from Peggy Christian's catalogue 12 (1980), item 354; the Fowles from John Chidley in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review, 9 (October 1982), 377; and the Boccaccio from information given to me by David L. Vander Meulen. Even when jackets survive, they often are not intact, and the commonest kind of mutilation is the clipping off of the price (or the words "Book Club Edition") from the corner of a flap (or from the spine or front, where prices more often appeared in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). Such clipping is of course usually perpetrated by those who give books as presents, but used-book dealers have also been known to conceal books' original prices in this way. Although there are other sources for the price (such as advertisements and publishing-trade journals), the jacket price serves as confirmation and can document price changes. Obviously the documentary value of a jacket is lessened when any part of it is missing, and those collectors who now insist on unclipped jackets (when it is feasible to do so) are to be applauded. There are, however, instances where jacket clipping is done by the publisher in connection with a price change: the seventh printing (1960) of R. B. McKerrow's An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students has a jacket with the price of 28s. printed in the lower corner of the front flap; the eighth printing (1962) has the price clipped off and a sticker with the price of 30s. affixed nearby. 71 71. The McKerrow book also offers evidence of how such a price change can have further bibliographical significance: David L. Vander Meulen reports that the sequence of the taller and shorter forms of what is labeled the 1951 printing is suggested by the fact that the taller one has the printed price of 25s. and that the shorter one has a sticker for 28s. next to a clipped corner. Of course, publishers sometimes simply placed stickers over the prices, without clipping. When prices are printed on the spines or fronts of jackets, clipping is obviously harder; but one does encounter copies with such prices cut out rather than covered up (sometimes no doubt by a purchaser who bought the book as a gift instead of by the publisher). Some publishers have also abetted clipping by printing a diagonal dotted line at the corner of the flap where the price is given or where a concise or coded identification of the book is placed (enabling booksellers to get credit for unsold copies by simply clipping those corners and sending them to the publisher). 72 72. An example on a Dutton jacket of 1947 (on Van Wyck Brooks's The Times of Melville and Whitman ) was reported by Barbara Heritage on the internet discussion group ExLibris (&lt;exlibris@library.berkeley.edu&gt;), 25 April 2005; the next day Kevin Mac Donnell responded with comments on publishers' methods for dealing with booksellers' returns and for keeping track of specific copies. (I am grateful to Terry Belanger for calling my attention to the discussion of jackets that occurred on ExLibris in April and May 2005 and to Mac Donnell for announcing my interest there.) Another kind of situation in which a publisher was responsible for price-clipping has been reported by B. J. McMullin: British publishers' colonial issues were sometimes identified only on the jackets, and he cites an example of the words "Macmillan's Overseas Library" being stamped next to price-clipped jacket corners ("Bell's Indian and Colonial Library," Biblionews and Australian Notes &amp; Queries, 31.1 [March 2005], 3-32 [see pp. 5-6]). And David L. Vander Meulen's jacketed copies of David Cornel DeJong's Around the Dom (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1964) reveal that the publisher placed different prices at the two right-hand corners of the front flap in order to enable the same jacket (with one corner clipped) to serve two markets. One copy of the jacket, with the bottom corner (and lower price) clipped, but leaving a slight trace of printing, is on a book with a centered vignette on the front cover of the binding; another copy of the jacket, with the upper corner (and higher price) clipped, has a "Holt Library Edition" sticker affixed and is on a book with full pictorial binding (matching the illustration on the jacket, but with "Holt Library Edition" added). Jackets with these various features bear witness to marketing history with a level of detail probably not available elsewhere. Further insight into marketing history is afforded by jackets supplied by bookseller-distributors rather than the original publishers: I have a copy of Pio Baroja's Youth and Egolatry (Knopf, 1920) in a printed jacket with the spine imprint of the Chicago bookseller-publisher Argus Books; its spine and front panel give the title and author, but its other surfaces list other publishers' books that were available from Argus. Even the number of surviving copies of jackets for particular books, especially if they are in fine condition, can in itself be evidence of publishing history: that certain books of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are found in jackets more frequently than one might expect suggests that publishers' stocks of those books were not quickly exhausted and that new copies of the original printings were still being sold many years after publication. (The dealer Cedric L. Robinson indicated in a 1977 catalogue that he could supply "new copies" in jacket of an 1885 Lippincott book, Gabriel Harrison's John Howard Payne. ) As with any other class of historical evidence, there is no way of predicting all the kinds of information that book-jackets may reveal or corroborate when examined in context by a knowledgeable person.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Besides disseminating graphic design, transmitting information, and simply being an element in the original published form of a book, every jacket plays its role in documenting the history of book-jackets in general . The account of the early development of the jacket that I offered in 1971 was based primarily on a sampling of only 262 items through 1900; I now know of more than that number just through 1890 (half again as many), and the number from the next decade is close to a thousand. 73 73. By "items" I mean entries in my list; some entries refer to more than one jacket (as in the case of two-volume works or multi-volume sets). But I need not retell the story in detail, for the outline remains the same. There were the sheaths (slip-cases open at one or both ends) that covered the literary annuals, gift books, and pocket diaries during the last years of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries. Then by the 1830s came printed wrappings that were sealed to cover all edges of books—a style that persisted at least through the 1860s, simultaneously with the emergence of jackets with flaps. The latter form—that is, the one that became standard—carried little printing in general during the nineteenth century, often only on the spine (or the spine and front panel), though there were early examples in which advertising appeared on the back and illustrations on the front and back (the flaps were not much used for printing until the 1890s). Although jackets of the 1890s and the first decade or so of the twentieth century frequently had decorations or illustrations, those embellishments were generally derived from, if not actual reproductions of, the binding designs ; and the jackets were clearly secondary to the bindings from the point of view of design and still largely served as protection for the elaborate bindings, though with a marketing function showing up in many instances. It was not until the second decade of the twentieth century that publishers' bindings began to grow plainer and the jackets more decorative. If this familiar story is not altered by the knowledge of a larger number of nineteenth-century jackets, there are nevertheless several contributions made by the expanded list, in addition to serving as a nucleus to which additional examples can be added. One is simply that the story now rests on a broader base of evidence. Second, by providing some help in the task of locating and examining a larger number of early jackets, the new list can encourage further study and potentially support additional insights. Third, it permits more detailed conclusions about the practices of some publishers and thus allows one to postulate the existence of jackets for certain books at the time of their publication, even when none are known to have survived. If, for example, one wondered whether Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge (Smith, Elder, 1886) or the hardcover issue of Howells's A Hazard of New Fortunes (Harper, 1890) originally appeared in jackets, one could consult the list and feel fairly certain in the first case and quite certain in the second that these books were published in jackets (since the list records a Smith, Elder book in 1882 and one in 1885 and shows eight Harper books in 1890). And when one book from a series or set is listed (such as a volume of the Longman "Badminton Library" from 1888 or the Warne "Chandos Classics" from 1889) one can sensibly believe that the others also once had jackets or boxes. Although such an exercise provides useful support for a surmise, one could argue that the range of examples in the list as a whole may give one some reason to suppose that any book from a major firm after the mid-1870s or so is probably more likely than not to have been published in a jacket. The list can serve these various purposes even though it is not a systematic attempt at a census of all surviving examples of early British and American publishers' detachable book-coverings. It is simply a list of those that have come to my attention during more than thirty-five years (including, that is, those in my 1971 list as well as those encountered since), and there are unquestionably many hundreds more that I have not learned about. But even if the total is two or three times the present number, what is now known constitutes a significant mass of evidence for studying an extremely scarce and widely scattered body of material. A few observations not made in 1971 are therefore in order. 74 74. One entry in my 1971 list has now been deleted, despite the attention it had received prior to 1971: William W. Lord's Poems (New York: Appleton, 1845). What was supposedly a jacket for this book was reported by T. O. Mabbott ( Publishers' Weekly, 133 [16 April 1938], 1632) as being bound into a copy at the Huntington Library; it was then mentioned and illustrated in Rosner's The Growth of the Book-Jacket (1954), p. xiv, and was also illustrated in Publishers' Weekly, 159 (10 February 1951), 901, and in Kurt Weidemann's Book Jackets and Record Covers: An International Survey (1969), p. vi. But a copy of this book at the Houghton Library shows that it was published in paper wrappers; and the two leaves of printed decorated paper bound into the rebound copy at the Huntington and another one at Harvard are most likely the front and back of the wrappers, not the front and back of a jacket. It seems reasonably certain that the earliest detachable coverings enclosing publishers' bindings were the sheaths that came with pocket diaries beginning in the late eighteenth century and with children's doll-dressing books beginning about 1810. Examples of the former are known for The Royal Repository, or Polite Pocket Diary for 1796 (London: J. Evance and W. Richardson, 1795) and The American Ladies &amp; Gentlemans Pocket Almanac and Belles Lettres Repository for 1802 (New York: David Longworth, 1801); examples of the latter from 1810 to 1814 survive for a number of the little books with loose paper-dolls and costumes published by S. &amp; J. Fuller at their Temple of Fancy. The German Taschenbuch of this period, with sheaths sometimes printed with calendars, was probably the model, at least for the diaries. Thus when in 1822 the London publisher Rudolph Ackermann, drawing on his knowledge of the German custom, set in motion the vogue for annual gift books in the English-speaking world by publishing the first number of the Forget Me Not, there was already a precedent for enclosing annuals in sheaths. For nine years, through the volume for 1831 (1830), Ackermann published the Forget Me Not in sheaths, as confirmed and explained by the Gentleman's Magazine review of the volume for 1832. According to the reviewer, Ackermann considered the glazed-paper-over-board covers no longer "worthy of this great age of improvement" and therefore had begun to clothe the annual "in the splendid but durable attire of crimson silk, which supersedes the necessity of a pasteboard case, as heretofore, to protect it from the soil of a dusty table." 75 75. "The Annuals. Forget Me Not, for 1832. By F. Schoberl. Ackermann," Gentleman's Magazine, 101 (October 1831), 340-342. This review is quoted by Eleanore Jamieson in "The Binding Style of the Gift Books and Annuals," in the 1973 reprint of F. W. Faxon's Literary Annuals and Gift Books (1912), pp. 7-17 (see p. 8); it is also quoted by B. J. McMullin (in the article cited in the text above at note 32), who corrects the page citation. Many of the other annuals, on both sides of the Atlantic, also employed sheaths during the 1820s. Although the number of examples in my list is small, comprising (in addition to eight volumes of the Forget Me Not ) only sixteen instances, they are distributed among eleven annuals published in Boston and Philadelphia as well as London, and thus they imply a fairly widespread and regular use. Certainly the sheath of the literary annual, which was an extremely popular genre, gave prominence to the idea of a detachable publisher's covering, and one can agree with Ruari McLean that it "can be called the progenitor of the book-jacket, since its function was to attract and protect." 76 76. Victorian Publishers' Book-Bindings in Paper (1983), p. 10. Sheaths were used on other books of this period as well—such as Hoyle's Games (1803), cited and illustrated by McLean (p. 19)—and on children's games and peep-shows—such as The Swan of Elegance (1814), in the Pierpont Morgan Library, and The Areaorama (1825), described in Judith St. John, The Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books (Toronto Public Library, 1958-75), p. 1050. The next step was the use of printed wrapping paper rather than sheaths to cover copies of annuals; the paper—printed with identifying text—was sealed around each book, enclosing it completely. Although the earliest examples known are on British annuals, The Keepsake for 1833 (Longman) and The Juvenile Scrap-Book for 1845-50 (Fisher, then Jackson), this style of covering was also used for other kinds of books at least through the 1860s. Surviving examples are understandably scarce, since these wrappings were likely to have been destroyed in the process of removing them in order to open the books. But a survivor on a book published by Appleton (New York) and Whitaker (London) in 1857 (Richard S. Gedney's Poetical Works ), two others on books published by Longman in 1860 (Edward Falkener's Daedalus and The Museum of Classical Antiquities ), and one on a book published by the Catholic Publication Society (New York) in 1869 (Aubrey De Vere's Irish Odes ) suggest—since at least two of the publishers of these books were major trade firms—that the practice had a continuing life even after jackets with flaps began to be used. Indeed, sealed wrapping is not unknown in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: at least one number of Bradley His Book (no. 3, July 1896) was wrapped in glassine printed with the notice that it was to be unsealed only by the owner; and Oliver Herford and John Cecil Clay's Happy Days (Kennerley, 1917) came completely sealed in unprinted glassine. 77 77. The Bradley was described in Colophon Book Shop catalogue 10 (LaGrange, Ill., 1978), item 106 ($85); the Herford is in my Kennerley collection. The covers were of course visible through the glassine, which was thus a forerunner of shrink-wrapping . Other forms of coverings—related to sealed wrappings in that they cover books more fully than the now traditional jackets with flaps do— have been used over the years for certain types of books. For pamphlets or thin books, the equivalent of a slip-case may seem more like an envelope . The earliest item in my list is a four-flapped wrapping (like the eighteenth-century mailing covers) around a 1791 Philadelphia pamphlet by John William Gerar de Brahm, with a 115-word presentation epistle (to be signed by the author) printed on the inside, where the pamphlet would lie. One might also best describe as an envelope the covering for the 1848 publication of F. O. C. Darley's Six Illustrations of Rip Van Winkle. And some of Kate Greenaway's small books for children—judging from surviving examples of her Almanack for 1890 and 1891 (Routledge)—were provided with mailing envelopes. 78 78. The Gerar de Brahm example, in the Lilly Library, was discussed by Josiah Q. Bennett in the December 1971 Serif (see note 31 above); the Darley was the first lot in the 1984 Leach sale (see part II above); the 1890 Greenaway (with a jacket as well as an envelope) is in the collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin; the 1891 Greenaway was offered in Wilder Books catalogue 9 (1984), item 51 ($675) and reoffered in catalogue 15 (1985), item Q ($275), where the envelope is described as a jacket with an enlarged back flap that can be folded over the front. (Of course, publishers' envelopes—sometimes unprinted—for pamphlets, especially those intended as gifts, continued to appear in the twentieth century, as on some of the Paul Elder booklets.) Another variation was to have three flaps at both front and back, so that a flap could fold over each edge of the covers (tops and bottoms as well as fore-edges): an 1878 example is a cloth jacket (now in the Bodleian) on William Stirling Maxwell's Antwerp Delivered in MDLXXVII (Edinburgh: David Douglas). A possible example, on Herbert Kleist's copy of Love Poems and Sonnets by "Owen Innsly" (Boston: Cupples, Upham, 1883), may instead be another instance of what was once a sealed wrapping, since the flaps are less than an inch wide and may well have originally been pasted together to cover the edges of the sheets of the book. In fact, some of the survivors among previously sealed wrappings are presently soiled, folded, or cut in such a way as to indicate that they survived by being forced to fit the book in the fashion of present-day jackets with flaps, so that they could continue to be used to protect the books during reading. On occasion publishers even encouraged readers to engage in this practice: a surviving jacket (in the Leach sale, lot 65) for John E. Wheelock's In Search of Gold (New York: Thompson, 1884) has a front flap printed with the words "Cut open at this line and use wrapper for outside cover." The activity of converting wrappings to jackets calls to mind the fact that models for jackets with flaps certainly existed in the early nineteenth century, whether or not they were used by publishers (and they may well have been), for the circulating libraries placed books in jackets printed with their names and the rules their members were supposed to follow. Thanks to Michael Zinman, I can report three American examples: one for the Glazier, Masters &amp; Co. Circulating Library (Hallowell, Maine), with the printed date of October 1828; another for Roorbach's Circulating Library (Charleston, S.C.), which includes an advertisement for Roorbach's book and stationery store (this jacket is presently on the December 1831 issue of the London Ladies Magazine ); and a third for the Free Library of the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York. Circulating-library books obviously needed protection, but there is evidence that individual owners also wished to protect their books, sometimes using wallpaper or other decorated paper for the purpose. 79 79. Among the books and pamphlets with wallpaper jackets at the American Antiquarian Society are James Janeway's A Token for Children (1821) and Amos Blanchard's Book of Martyrs (3rd ed., 1832); among the library's books with added jackets inscribed by early owners is a copy of Daniel Adams's The Scholar's Arithmetic (1828), with a jacket inscribed "Harry G. Taintor's book, Plainfield Academy, September 7, 1828." The paper-backed leather jacket—with lettering on the spine—on a copy of the 1819 edition of Richard Martyrs (3rd ed. 1832); among the library's books with added jackets inscribed by early another example of a jacket supplied by an owner; but because it was possibly provided by the author-publisher or his bookseller, I have included it provisionally in the appended list of early publishers' jackets (where a further discussion can be found). The rise of cloth binding clearly produced the urge to protect those bindings, and manufacturers were glad to satisfy this demand with ready-made covers of varying sizes. By at least the 1870s the London firm of Marcus Ward &amp; Co. Limited was selling "Marcus Ward's Adaptable Book Covers, (registered) for Book Clubs, Lending Libraries, Schools and Home Use." Available in seven-, eight-, and nine-inch sizes, at one shilling per dozen, these covers were made of patterned paper with a blank space on the spine for lettering. In America, Sherwood's of New York made for P. F. Van Everen "The `Van Everen' Self-Fitting Adjustable Book Covers" (patented 14 February 1888), advertised as "the Aristocrat of book covers" and as "the standard of perfection since extra covers came into use"; they were offered in three sizes made of "heavy craft paper which sheds water and is impervious to moisture," with flaps to be folded over all edges and glued according to detailed instructions printed on the jacket ("leaving no part exposed, even on flat juveniles"). Discounts were available for libraries and schools, and "Van Everen's perforated and gummed numbers &amp; alphabets" could also be purchased, so that titles and dates could be affixed to the jackets. 80 80. The Victoria and Albert Museum has examples of the Marcus Ward jackets on books in the Alexander Dyce and John Forster collections, which came to the museum in 1869 and 1876, respectively. (I am grateful to Rowan Watson for this information.) Michael Zinman has a copy of an advertisement for the Van Everen jackets, and Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin have an example of Size A. Zinman also has some later examples of jackets for organizations, such as the Eclectic Reading Club jacket, dated 1893, on a copy of Harper's for August 1893, and the "Texan Book Cover" ("Designed for Use in the Public Schools of Texas"), found on a copy of Elementary Spanish Prose Book (Benjamin H. Sanborn &amp; Co., 1924). Many other commercially manufactured jackets for use on school books were produced in the twentieth century. The existence of this kind of product should not be taken to indicate that publishers' jackets were uncommon; rather, the emphasis on the durability and protective features of these "extra covers" seems designed to suggest their superiority to the fragile and easily detached jackets provided by publishers. Many individuals no doubt made their own jackets instead of buying such products, and one can never be sure whether a plain (unprinted) jacket on a nineteenth-century book was placed there by an owner, perhaps to replace a damaged printed jacket, or by the publisher—except in those rare cases where one encounters a number of copies in identical jackets. 81 81. As with the Newberry Library's remainder stock of Memorial Sketch of Dr. William Frederick Poole of 1895 (one of the private printings supervised by Stone &amp; Kimball). That is why I have limited my list of early jackets to ones that are printed, but there are many examples of plain jackets that one is tempted to believe are actually publishers' jackets. 82 82. A few examples (out of many) are the following: J. David Williams (ed.), America Illustrated (Manhattan Printing and Publishing Co., 1877), listed in Bromer catalogue 37 (1985), item 2 ($125); Trollope, How the "Mastiffs" Went to Iceland (Virtue, 1878), cited by Jim McCue (see note 50 above); Stevenson, Underwoods (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1887), listed in Wilder catalogue 9 (1984), item 123 ($950), and 15 (1985), item DI ($450); Twain, The £1,000,000 Bank Note, cited by Kevin Mac Donnell (see note 47 above); Housman, A Shropshire Lad (Kegan Paul, 1896), cited in Robert F. Metzdorf, The Tinker Library (1959), entry 1243 ("original glazed paper jacket"); Wilde, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (Smithers, 1898), listed in Black Sun Books 1976 catalogue ( New York Miscellany ), item 50 ($275); Howells, Their Silver Wedding Journey (1899), listed in Trebizond Rare Books catalogue 6 (1977), item 63 ($60). (See also the 1984 Leach sale catalogue, lots 41, 77, 78, 79, 80 [plus wrapping paper], 82, 101, 114, 115, 118, 129, 148 [through 1890].) An unprinted jacket over wrappers is on Harriet P. James, Cruise of Yacht "Coronet" to Hawaiian Islands and Japan (New York: William C. Martin, 1897), in the Amherst College Library (reported by John Lancaster). Three examples of unprinted cloth jackets are on John Muir, Picturesque California (New York and San Francisco: Dewing, 1888), in Leach sale (1984), lot 110 ($575); Hawthorne, The Marble Faun (Houghton Mifflin, 1890), in Leach sale, lot 146 (two two-volume sets; $5); and Eugene Field, The House (Scribner, 1896), listed in Wilder Books catalogue 15 (1985), item L ($225). Michael Zinman reported to me an unprinted sheath on Elias Smith and Abner Jones, Hymns (Portsmouth: Smith, 1815), and a box (lacking its top, which may have had a label) for the four volumes of Jacob Abbott's The William Gay Series (Hurd &amp; Houghton, 1869); and Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin have (among others) an unprinted box for Sentiments and Similes of William Shakespeare (2nd ed., Longman, 1857). One glassine jacket (out of many) that is likely to be the publisher's is on Henryk Sienkiewicz, In Vain (Little, Brown, 1899), in the Morris-Levin collection. Although in assembling my list I have recorded only British and American examples, it is important to be aware of the European context , as the relation of the slip-cased Taschenbuch to the form of the English-language annuals suggests. 83 83. See the illustration of Das Taschenbuch for 1804 (Leipzig: Gleditsch, 1803) in Anne Renier's Friendship's Offering: An Essay on the Annuals and Gift Books of the 19th Century (1964), plate 2 (facing p. 9). Sheaths continued to be used for French as well as German annuals for several decades, 84 84. The Parisian publishers Louis Janet and LeFuel were responsible for many annuals in sheaths with printed labels on the sides. The collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin contains Janet examples from 1817 ( Hommage aux dames ), 1821 ( Le luth français ), and 1828 ( Annales romantiques ) and LeFuel examples from 1819 ( Le musée des théâtres ), 1823 ( Hommage aux demoiselles ), and 1823 and 1832 ( Almanach dédié aux dames ), as well as a Marcilly example from 1821 ( Etrennes de polymnie ); and I have an 1824 Janet example ( Lyre des demoiselles ). (Morris and Levin in their book [see note 63 above] cite the 1828 Janet [item 8] and two 1823 LeFuel items [9, 10].) In 1971 Charles Mann reported to me two German annuals in Philip Shelley's collection that were published twenty-six years apart: the Taschenbuch auf das Jahr 1804 von Wieland und Goethe (published by Cotta of Tübingen in 1803, with calendars on the sides of the sheath), and the Urania for 1830 (published by Bruckhaus of Leipzig in 1829, with a printed label on one of the narrow sides of the sheath). Morris and Levin report that they have seen a Viennese example from 1826: Aglaja: Taschenbuch für das Jahr 1827, published by Johann B. Wallishausser. but sheaths and boxes were sometimes used to house other kinds of books as well. 85 85. Such as La pastourelle (1819), Blanche Marguerite (1827), and Jean-Pierre Brès's Voyage pittoresque et romantique sur la cheminée (1828), all Louis Janet publications in sheaths; Contes de toutes les couleurs and Musée des dames et des demoiselles (each 6 vols.; Marcilly, ca. 1825-30), in two-piece boxes with title labels on the top panels; and Réglement concernant l'exercise et les manoeuvres de l'infanterie (3 vols.; Levrault, 1831), in a box printed on three sides. (The last example is in the Newberry Library; the others are in the collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin—and the Musée is cited in their book [see note 63 above], item 5.) At least as early as 1839 modern-style paper jackets were apparently in use in Germany. Jerome E. Anderson reported to me in 1971 a copy of an 1839 Bädeker book, Friedrich Hoffmann's Funfzig Räthsel und Bilder für Kinder von 8-12 Jahren, in a jacket of pink porous paper printed on the front (title), spine (title, author, decoration), and back (list of other titles). And by the 1860s and 1870s there are such examples as Chamisso's Peter Schlemihl (Leipzig, 1860), Lessing's Nathan der Weise (Berlin, 1868, with the date on the jacket), Karl Wilhelm Osterwald's Erzählungen aus der alten deutschen Welt für Jung und Alt (Halle, 1868, with the date on the jacket), Album für Deutschlands Töchter (7th ed.; Leipzig , 1871), and Hessel Gerritsz's The Arctic North-East and West Passage (Amsterdam, 1878). Eric Quayle, whose collection contained a copy of the Osterwald jacket in 1971, called it "The earliest printed dust-wrapper that can be dated with certainty. . . . No printed dust-wrapper manufactured earlier . . . is known to have survived." This comment (if we exclude slip-cases and wrappings that enclose books completely) could rather be applied to the 1839 Hoffmann jacket, which—as far as my knowledge goes—precedes the earliest reported English modern-style jackets by about two decades. 86 86. This statement is accurate even if the leather jacket on a copy of the 1819 edition of Richard Phillips's The Universal Preceptor is a publisher's jacket (see note 79 above), for it can scarcely be regarded as a modern-style jacket. The Quayle quotation is from The Collector's Book of Books (1971), pp. 114-115 (including an illustration of the front panel, with its printed date). The Chamisso and Lessing jackets were reported by Thomas Warburton in Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries, 1.4 (October 1935), 6; the Album is in the collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin; the Gerritsz is listed in D. &amp; E. Lake's catalogue 84 (1987), item 108. The Hoffmann jacket makes clear that the idea of using the back panel for advertising occurred early, and it reminds one that the earliest known English paper book-covering, for the 1833 Keepsake, also has an advertisement on the back. In light of the many nineteenth-century jackets that have printing only on the spine, or the spine and front panel, one may be surprised by these early instances of advertising on the back. But one should remember that there was a model ready to hand in the form of the advertisements and testimonials printed on the covers of some books in the boards-and-label period spanning the last years of the eighteenth century and the early decades of the nineteenth century. Although those covers were not readily detachable, publishers assumed that many owners would regard them as temporary and have them replaced with leather bindings. As coverings that were truly detachable and dispensable came to be used over bindings that were meant to be retained, it would have been natural to continue the practice of placing advertising in the same visible position, as the 1833 Keepsake and the 1869 Magnolia (New York: Leavitt) did. But the custom was clearly not universal (nor was it, of course, on the printed boards earlier): examples are known from major publishers in the 1870s (Lee &amp; Shepard, Putnam, Routledge) and onward, but there is a large number of surviving jackets from the 1870-1900 period with blank back panels. This observation reinforces the point (which I made in 1971) that the use of jacket surfaces in the second half of the nineteenth century does not display a steady general development but rather reflects the practices of individual publishers. John Carter was saying much the same thing in his historic letter to the Publisher and Bookseller (19 August 1932) when he noted that the 1860 jacket for Pilgrim's Progress "is so far from looking primitive that it would not look out of place on a book published to-day." Although one can locate jackets of the 1880s with printing on the front, spine, back, and even the flaps, 87 87. The earliest examples I have encountered of text or illustration on flaps are the jackets for the Black edition of the Waverley Novels (London, 1885-87; Ferret Fantasy 1988 catalogue, item 123), Charles Hindley's The History of the Catnach Press (London: The author, 1886; described by Peter C. G. Isaac in the 1975 Library article cited earlier), and two books published by the Chicago firm Belford, Clarke: George Macdonald's Wilfrid Cumbermede (in the "Caxton Edition" series, 1888; Leach sale, lot 108), and Jane Porter's Thaddeus of Warsaw (1889; Leach sale, lot 124). one also finds (for example) many Harper and Houghton Mifflin jackets of the 1890s printed only on the spines. Similarly, the retail price was often included on jacket spines or fronts from the 1870s through the 1910s, 88 88. Prices had earlier appeared on some of the mid-century wrappings (like those on The Juvenile Scrap-Book for 1847-50). or on flaps (I know of Lothrop examples from 1888 and 1895), or on box labels (Macmillan, 1894); but often the price is not given at all on jackets of this period. The indication of the number of copies in print also appeared fairly early (an 1874 example is "Fourteenth Thousand" on the jacket for Poe's poems in Griffin's "Emerald Series"; and a later printing of an 1883 Revell book, Hannah Whitall Smith's The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, carried a jacket proclaiming "Thirty-Fifth Thousand"); but the practice does not seem to have become common in the nineteenth century. Illustrations, too, were used at least as early as 1860 (on the Longman edition of Pilgrim's Progress ) but were not a regular feature of nineteenth-century jackets. And binding designs were repeated on jackets by some publishers in the 1860s (Jonathan Couch's The History of the Fishes of the British Islands, published in London by Groombridge &amp; Sons in 1862-65, and The Bryant Festival at "The Century," published by Appleton in 1865); but many books with interesting bindings in the 1890s have unattractive typographic jackets. Among the few general trends that can be asserted with some confidence is the dominance of the modern-style flapped jacket over other types of covering by at least the mid-1860s. Another, as I suggested earlier, is that such jackets were as commonly used by publishers during the last quarter of the nineteenth century as they were during the twentieth century. I base this conclusion not simply on the number of surviving examples but also on the fact that most of the major British and American publishers are repeatedly represented, with a wide range of types of books, as well as many smaller publishers from a variety of geographical locations. 89 89. The 1875 dividing line is of course approximate, and probably too conservative, judging from the nature of the surviving examples of the preceding ten years; but the small body of evidence makes further analysis difficult. Just as the nineteenth century began with gift books in slip-cases, so the end of the century saw a similar phenomenon. The books were not annuals but rather popular novels, classics, and travel books that could be marketed in fancy illustrated editions, frequently in two volumes; and the slip-cases were not sheaths but boxes with their open sides corresponding to where the spines of the books would show and with printed labels affixed to the opposite side (and sometimes the wider sides). These books, though their bindings were protected by boxes, also were generally supplied with jackets, commonly made of cloth backed with stiff paper and printed only on the spines. 90 90. That the term for what we now call "jackets" was not yet established in the 1890s is shown by an advertisement for a boxed series in Publishers' Weekly, 43 (28 January 1893), 207: "Illustrated Edition of Popular Poets" was said to be available in "cloth slip wrappers, each book in a cloth box." As late as 1932 Henry McAnally, in "Book-Wrappers," Book Collector's Quarterly, 6 (April 1932), 10-17, was speculating about what the object ought to be called; he felt that it had "not yet attained to a settled name" but that "the catalogues of the greater and more conscious booksellers" use "dust-wrapper" (p. 10). In some instances the open (spine) side of the box was covered with a removable lid, and the label was pasted on one end of the box, indicating that these boxes were intended to sit, in the bookshop or on the parlor table, so that the books inside were resting on their fore-edges. When certain one-volume works were given this treatment—especially thin books with elaborate bindings, often containing a single heavily illustrated poem— the lid usually fit over one of the wide sides of the box, exposing the front cover of the book (or the front panel of the jacket) when removed. If such boxes for one- and two-volume gift editions were a striking phenomenon of the late nineteenth century, 91 91. They had not been unknown earlier, in undecorated form, as for Bibles and prayer books. the use of boxes with printed labels or hinged lids for multi-volume sets went back at least to mid-century: they were commonly used for series of children's books, such as "Cousin Lucy's Stories" by Jacob Abbott (Auburn, N.Y.: Derby &amp; Miller, 1850), and for standard sets, such as The Handy-Volume Shakespeare in thirteen volumes (London: Bradbury, Evans; New York: Wynkoop, 1867). In the early years of the twentieth century there was little change in publishers' practices in using jackets and boxes. That their function was still largely to protect decorative bindings is suggested by a jingle printed on the jacket of the 1913 Methuen edition of John Oxenham's Bees in Amber: "This outer wrap is only meant / To keep my coat from detriment . / Please take it off, and let me show / The better one I wear below." 92 92. Quoted by Michael Moon in a letter to the Antiquarian Book Monthly Review, 13 (January 1986), 25. It was not always necessary to take the protective jacket off in order to see the binding, or at least part of it, as my copy of Margaret Turnbull's Looking after Sandy (Harper, 1914) shows: the jacket has an oval hole in the front panel, revealing the picture that is pasted to the front cover of the binding. 93 93. Holes were frequently placed in the spines of jackets for series books, allowing the same jacket to be used for all volumes, since the titles of the individual volumes showed through the holes. Another, far less common, style of jacket that permits the binding to be seen consists of clear plastic with printed paper flaps attached; two examples in my possession are for Monk Gibbon's Seventeen Sonnets (London: Joiner &amp; Steele, 1932) and Christopher Hassall's Words by Request (London: Arthur Barker, 1952). (Bindings can of course be seen through shrink-wrapping when books thus published do not have jackets; for detachable printed material that may nevertheless be supplied, see note 94 below.) Despite the appearance, before this time, of jackets with illustrations and blurbs printed on them, the idea that the artistry and verbiage of jackets could be a marketing tool had not yet become a dominant force in the production of jackets, though it was certainly a growing one. And during the 1910s this situation changed dramatically, so that by the 1920s many publishers thought of jackets rather than bindings as the place for striking designs. Since jackets were an established presence, it made sense to use their surfaces to the full and save money on the less visible bindings. From then on, the history of book-jackets is primarily the story of shifting tastes in graphic design and in advertising style, rather than of changes in form or function. One formal development worth noting, however, is the occasional addition of the wrap-around band or "flash," a narrow strip of paper extending around the jacket, with ends either stuck together or folded inside the book covers along with the jacket flaps. (An example is the one on the American edition of Edward Dahlberg's The Flea of Sodom [New Directions, 1950], which quotes from Herbert Read's introduction.) Such bands were naturally meant to attract additional attention to the books they adorned and often reported a late-breaking news item, such as the award of a major prize to the book or its author. The result for collectors and other students of publishing history was to create an additional challenge, for bands are understandably more ephemeral than jackets, and their survival rate is even lower. 94 94. The same can be said of the printed paper or card sometimes laid on the cover of an unjacketed book so as to be visible thorugh shrink-wrapping, thus supplying the descriptive text that would otherwise be on the jacket (an example is my Guide to the Study of United States Imprints [Harvard, 1971]). A similar challenge is locating the dust-jackets for paperback books. The emergence of mass-market paperbacks in the 1930s was of course one of the major events in Anglo-American publishing history in the twentieth century, and by that time jackets were such an established part of publishing that one should not be surprised by their use on some early Albatross and Penguin paperbacks. 95 95. Jackets over wrappers were not unknown earlier: a famous example is James Whitcomb Riley's " The Old Swimmin' Hole" and 'Leven More Poems (Indianapolis: Hitt, 1883); and an example from the following year is James B. Thayer's A Western Journey with Mr. Emerson (Little, Brown, 1884). (A copy of the Riley was in the 1990 Bradley Martin sale, lot 2236; one of the Thayer was in the 1984 Leach sale, lot 64, and in the current stock of Mac Donnell Rare Books.) But as a category they should be subdivided into two groups, according to whether or not the wrappers are printed. Jackets over printed wrappers are comparable to jackets on hardcover books; but jackets over unprinted wrappers constitute a style of binding, in which the "jacket," though detachable, is an essential part of the binding , not a covering for it. Both the Riley and the Thayer books in fact illustrate both types: the binding of the Riley, for example, consists of a loose cream wrapper, printed like the title-page, folded over an attached unprinted paper wrapper; over this double wrapper is a brown-paper jacket with simpler printing. See Anthony J. and Dorothy R. Russo, A Bibliography of James Whitcomb Riley (1944), p. 3. Kevin Mac Donnell has reported to me some nineteenth-century examples of detachable printed wrappers over unprinted card-stock wrappers (the kind of detachable covering I do not consider a "jacket"): Oliver Bell Bunce's Bachelor Bluff (Appleton, 1883); Don't: A Manual of Mistakes by "A Censor" (also Appleton, 1883); Thackeray's Complete Poems (White, Stokes &amp; Allen, 1884); and Whittier's Saint Gregory's Guest (Houghton Mifflin, 1886). There were even more specific reasons , however, for the jackets that appeared on Pocket Books and Bantam titles in the 1940s: jackets with new illustrations were added to resuscitate slow-selling titles, or to call attention to movies, or to indicate new publishers' takeover of existing stocks. The classic holy grail for paperback collectors (like the Gatsby jacket for twentieth-century hardcover collectors) is the Stanley Meltzoff jacket on some of the later printings (beginning in 1945) of the Pocket Books edition of The Maltese Falcon. 96 96. Illustrated by Piet Schreuders in Paperbacks U.S.A.: A Graphic History, 1939-1959 (1981), p. 167 (on a 1947 printing), and cited by Richard Layman in Dashiell Hammett: A Descriptive Bibliography (1979), entry A3.3a (fourth printing, February 1945). Schreuders also comments on paperback jackets on pp. 27, 52, 85-86, 115-116, and elsewhere. A list of paperbacks with jackets (from five publishers) is offered by Peter Manesis in "Cover Up!", Paperback Quarterly, 4.1 (Spring 1981), 26-30 (see pp. 28-29, including illustrations), supplemented by letters from Bill Lyles and Bob Briney, 4.2 (Summer 1981), 52, and from Daniel Gobbett, 4.3 (Fall 1981), 50 (mentioning additional publishers, including two British ones, Hutchson and Guild Books). See also Bill Crider and Billy C. Lee, "Some Notes on Movie Editions," Paperback Quarterly, 2.1 (Spring 1979), 29-36 (esp. p. 32); Thomas L. Bonn, Under Cover: An Illustrated History of the American Mass Market Paperbacks (1982), pp. 26-27, 99-100; Moe Wadle, The Movie Tie-In Book (1994); and Gary Lovisi, "Collecting and Dealing in Paperback Books," AB Bookman's Weekly, 103 (11 January 1999), 57-60 (see p. 58). (A related phenomenon is the use of jackets on wrapper-bound proof copies: an example, reported by David L. Vander Meulen, is the "Uncorrected Proof" of Frances Parkinson Keyes's The Gold Slippers [Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1958], in wrappers and with a jacket.) If surviving examples of paperback jackets and nineteenth-century hardcover jackets are scarce enough that it is feasible to list them, a different means must be found for gaining bibliographical control over the vast quantities of twentieth-century examples on hardcover books. We can look to descriptive bibliographies of authors and presses and to monographs on graphic artists for the recording of many significant jackets, but the number dealt with in this way will always be a tiny fraction of the total. The logical solution is for libraries to take note of the presence of jackets in their cataloguing of books 97 97. That jackets might actually be useful in cataloguing is shown by Emma Stribling Dendy in The Utility of Book Jackets in Subject Cataloging (Master's thesis, University of North Carolina, 1956). Other library-school theses have dealt with the role of jackets in book circulation: examples are Deborah K. Smith, Check-Out Rates of Books with Book Jackets versus Books without Book Jackets (University of Wyoming, 1989), and Marian F. West, Putting on a Good Front: The Impact of Book Cover Design on Circulation (University of Central Arkansas, 1992). and to make it possible for such references to be located through searching in electronic catalogues. Some special-collections libraries already do this, but others do not. 98 98. An example of a website reporting the jackets in a special collection is "Vietnam War Literature Collection Dust Jackets," listing 245 jackets in the Special Collections Department of the University of Delaware Library, available through the Library's website (&lt;http://www.lib.udel.edu&gt;). The New York Public Library Digital Gallery site (&lt;http:// digitalgallery.nypl.org&gt;) includes "Dust Jackets from American and European Books, 1926-1947," containing over two thousand jackets that NYPL librarians saved from the routine destruction to which most jackets were consigned by the Library. In any case, the prior requirement is for libraries to preserve jackets in the first place—something that research libraries have generally been loath to do, except for books that go into special collections (though public libraries have often kept jackets, with a protective covering around them, on circulating books). The situation is reflected in Robert A. Tibbetts's comment, regarding the Charvat Collection of pre-1901 American fiction at Ohio State University, that "most of the dustjackets that once accompanied its books were lost to library processing before the collection became an entity." Libraries' disregard for jackets is epitomized by the response of a major research library when it was offered the opportunity to purchase en bloc the great Leach collection of American nineteenth-century jacketed books: it rejected the offer on the grounds that a large portion of the books duplicated those already in the collection, ignoring entirely the fact that none of the jackets would have been duplicates. Barbara Ringer, when she was Register of Copyrights in the U. S. Copyright Office, was so "appalled" by the Library of Congress practice of throwing away the "vast majority" of the jackets it received that she arranged to store them at her own expense. 99 99. Tibbetts's comment prefaces his list of nineteenth-century jackets in Serif, 10.2 (Summer 1973), 42. The offer of the Leach collection was reported by Kevin Mac Donnell (the dealer who made the offer) on ExLibris (see note 72 above), 22 April 2005. Ringer's concern for jackets was mentioned in Publishers' Weekly, 215 (20 February 1978), 29-30. Library practices vary, as A. S. A. Struik discovered in the mid-1990s when he conducted a survey of eighteen Dutch libraries and thirteen national libraries in other countries. His questionnaire asked, among other things, whether the jackets of newly acquired books were saved (and if so, how they were described and housed) and whether pre-1900 jackets had been inventoried or were ever purchased as such. The replies were not encouraging. Although many of the libraries claimed to save some of the jackets on newly acquired books, these affirmative responses were often undercut by various qualifications, and only two libraries (both Dutch) reported any effort to describe their jackets, even superficially . And not a single library answered yes to the question whether it intended to "collect or simply save" jackets in the future. As far as pre1900 jackets are concerned, only one library—the Museum Meermanno Westreenianum in The Hague—indicated that it maintained an inventory of such jackets, and only five (the British Library, the Library of Congress, and three Dutch libraries) stated that they had ever bought a book purely for the sake of its jacket. 100 100. The detailed results of Struik's survey are reported in the Quaerendo article cited in note 29 above. Among his observations is surprise that copyright-deposit libraries have no regulations about the retention and description of jackets. That so many libraries, including copyright-deposit libraries, are so unconcerned with jackets brings to mind the language (quoted earlier) of Alan Smith, who calls it a "tragedy" that libraries have shirked their "obligations" to scholars by engaging in the "vandalism" of destroying jackets. This language is not too strong because book-jackets, as an important class of primary documentation of publishing history, are unquestionably part of what research libraries are pledged to preserve. Other categories have been neglected in the past, such as publishers' archives, but for a long time now the value of such records has been well understood. It is shocking, therefore, that in the early twenty-first century , with the field called "book history" flourishing, there should be so relatively little thinking directed toward the preservation and cataloguing of past and future book-jackets. The picture is not entirely bleak: thanks to the understanding of collectors and dealers, which has become widespread only in the past generation or so, special-collections departments are now in possession of a great many jackets, which have arrived largely as parts of collections but sometimes through the purchase of single items. These jackets are likely to be noteworthy because of their age or the fame of the books they cover, and their preservation seems assured. What we need to be concerned about is the fate of all the other jackets that survive and all that will appear on new books in the future. Some large libraries have not destroyed all the jackets that came their way; but those they have saved (often intermittently and inconsistently) tend to be very difficult (or in some cases nearly impossible) to use because of the way they have been stored and the lack of adequate (or any) cataloguing. 101 101. At the conference mentioned in the next paragraph, there were reports on the history of the handling of jackets in four libraries, by Stephen Bury (British Library), Julie Ann Lambert (Bodleian), David McKitterick (Cambridge University Library), and Rowan Watson (Victoria &amp; Albert). These talks dramatically showed how the practices have varied over the years in each of these libraries and have resulted in posing obstacles for scholars. Many jackets of the past are lost, but many others await an act of reclamation. The idea of a "Jacket Conservation Year," proposed by Alan Smith, may be unrealistic; but there is reason to hope that we are entering a period of consciousness-raising in regard to jackets, judging from the conference on jackets that was sponsored by the Institute of English Studies at the University of London on 19-20 September 2005, 102 102. Organized by Philip Errington and Warwick Gould, the conference was called "Dust-Jackets: The Fate and State of Removable Dust-Jackets" and consisted of talks by Brian Alderson, R. A. Gekoski, Alan Powers, Colin Smythe, and me, as well as the four reports mentioned in the preceding note. A thorough account of this conference is provided by Julian Rota in Antiquarian Booksellers' Association Newsletter, 333 (AugustSeptember 2005). along with the news that a future series of Panizzi Lectures may deal with the subject. Libraries must be encouraged to face (and be given assistance in dealing with) three long-neglected tasks. First is the proper housing of all the jackets in their possession that are not in special-collections stacks, as well as all that come with future acquisitions. Whether jackets are kept on the books, with mylar around them, or filed separately will be decided differently by different libraries; the important matter is that they be carefully and systematically preserved. Second is the inclusion of a reference to the presence of a jacket in catalogue entries for books, so that a library's jacket holdings can be ascertained as readily as its book holdings. Third is the requirement for taking jackets into account in acquisition policies for noncurrent books. Besides these basic necessities, the creation of a cooperative database of digitized images of jackets is a great desideratum (despite the problems that copyright may pose), so long as it does not lead anyone to suppose that the originals can be disposed of—a response that has all too often followed the microfilming or digitization of monographs and serials. Reproductions of jackets, like reproductions of anything else, can never replace originals. 103 103. I have elaborated this point in many places, such as the three essays reprinted in part II of my Literature and Artifacts (1998)—"Reproductions and Scholarship," "The Latest Forms of Book-Burning," and "The Future of Primary Records"—and in "The Librarians' Double-Cross," Raritan, 21.4 (Spring 2002), 245-263 (reviewing Nicholson Baker's 2001 book Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper ). And the need for the preservation of multiple copies is just as crucial in the case of jackets as it is for books, newspapers, and all other printed items, since jackets are just as susceptible to variation among copies and since the value of widespread access to originals is just as great. Whenever libraries in quantity begin to regard the collecting and cataloguing of jackets as an accepted part of their mission and start contributing to a union database of images, we will be well on the way to rescuing what remains of a body of material that enriches publishing history, and thus cultural and intellectual history as well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS During the course of thirty-five years, my study of book-jackets has benefited from the help of many individuals. To begin with, I want to record profound gratitude to the late Richard Colles Johnson, who faithfully over many years contributed significant pieces of information (as he did for so many other projects of mine as well). And I am delighted to indicate the great importance to me of the friendship and support of the late John Carter, the pioneer student of book-jackets (as of many other aspects of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books). I also am deeply appreciative of the thoughtful care given to my work by David L. Vander Meulen, editor of Studies in Bibliography, and by his assistant, Elizabeth Lynch.

      <field name="fulltext">A LIST OF PRE-1891 EXAMPLES OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN PUBLISHERS' PRINTED BOOK-JACKETS, SLIP-CASES, AND OTHER DETACHABLE COVERINGS THIS list does not attempt to be a census of all surviving examples; it is simply a record of those that have come to my attention over a period of more than thirty-five years. But because it is a sizable list (with nearly four hundred entries), it provides a reasonable body of evidence for generalizing about the history of publishers' detachable coverings through 1890. (A list covering the next decade will be published later.) It also gives one a basis for extrapolation: by noting which publishers are known to have used jackets or slip-cases in particular years, one is in a better position to conjecture whether any other book from the same period was likely to have had such a covering at the time of its publication. (In the case of series, one can be nearly certain that the other titles in a series, in addition to those listed here, had jackets; but the list records only the specific titles known to have survived in jackets.) Entries are arranged chronologically, and within each year they are ordered alphabetically by publisher (then author). The year of each entry is the date of the copy cited, which may be later than the date of the first printing. I have generally repeated the dates given in my sources without further investigation (which would in any case probably be inconclusive without the copies at hand); but when I have reason to suspect that the year assigned by a source is based on a copyright-page date and that the book may possibly be from a later printing, I have placed an asterisk after the citation. Copies that have been assigned approximate dates are listed separately at the end. The serial numbers assigned to the entries consist of the last two digits of the year, followed—after a period—by consecutive numbers within the year. (For the two eighteenth-century entries, all four digits of the year are used; and for entries in the "Approximate Dates" section, an "X" replaces the year-digits.) The amount of information in the entries varies considerably, depending on what was available in my sources and notes. Each entry normally has four parts (though the third is lacking in some instances). (1) Publisher and city (usually excluding the names of any secondary publishers or cities mentioned in imprints). (2) Author, title, and (if applicable) series or edition (with the names of editors, illustrators, and translators selectively added). (3) A brief description of the jacket and/or slip-case, indicating (when my information allows) the color (if other than white, gray, tan, or cream), the surfaces containing printed matter (with unusual features of the content mentioned), and the color of the printing (when other than black). (4) Source(s), including institutional libraries, private collections (with years signifying the latest date when to my knowledge the books were in those collections), dealers' and auction-house catalogues, published articles and books, and private letters or conversations; when the citations (in all these categories) are brief, they are usually identified more fully in the index. Published illustrations are referred to in the following entries: 03.1, 23.1, 24.3, 26.2, 27.2-3, 28.1-2, 29.1, 30.2, 32.1, 44.1, 46.1, 57.2, 60.3, 61.1, 65.1, 69.4, 70.2, 73.1, 76.3, 78.2, 78.6, 78.9, 82.8, 86.5, 86.13, 88.5, 89.24. The following symbols are used to signal entries for detachable coverings other than jackets of the now conventional type: § envelope or all-over wrapping ¢ cloth jacket(s) † sheath or box ‡ box and paper jacket(s) †¢ box and cloth jacket(s) The index to the list is subdivided as follows: (1) Authors, editors, illustrators , and translators (plus personal-name subjects, and titles without named authors). (2) Publishers and series: British (London); British (other than London); American (New York); American (other than New York). (3) Libraries . (4) Collectors. (5) Dealers and auction houses.

Black limp roan jacket with black paper backing, stamped in blind on front and back (a two-line border around the edges) and in gold on spine (title). One's first thought about this jacket is that it was made by an owner of the book, and it very well may have been. But three pieces of evidence (furnished to me by Selwyn H. Goodacre, the owner of the book in 1982) suggest at least the possibility that the jacket was supplied by the author-publisher or by the bookseller named in the imprint (or another bookseller) at the time of original sale: (1) at the foot of the title-page, the price is stated as "4s. 6d. bound"; (2) the front paste-down endpaper has an inscription dated "October 13 1825"; (3) the binding has no lettering whatever. Thus the binding dates from before 13 October 1825, and in light of the title-page notation (indicating that copies were sold bound) it may date from 1819; and perhaps the reason that the binding has no lettering is that it was to be provided with a jacket carrying a spine-title. This reasoning leads me to include the jacket here with a question mark. [Collection of Selwyn H. Goodacre, 15 October 1982.] 1822 † 22.1. Ackermann (London). Forget Me Not . . . 1823.

      <field name="fulltext">BOOK history is still a relatively new form of interdisciplinary inquiry that has yet to develop historiographical understandings adequate to the complexities of the questions it typically seeks to answer. 1 1. The word "historiography" is here predicated to mean: the principles, theories, or methodologies of scholarly historical research and writing. In other words, what we as researchers of book-historical matters think we are doing and why. The truth of this troubling and troublesome assessment is especially evident, I believe, in the highly ambitious national histories of the book currently in progress. As a co-editor, with Michael Turner, of The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 5, 1695-1830 (hereafter, CHBB5 ), I have been considering for several years now the theoretical and practical implications of current book-historical knowledge about the hand-press period in Britain. I have also been thinking about how the collective understandings of our intellectual enterprise as book historians—that is, the historiographies of book history— affect the ways in which scholars proceed in their investigations. Drawing on the experience of editing CHBB5 (and, to a lesser degree, of working as co-general editor, with Henry Woudhuysen, on The Oxford Companion to the Book, now in progress), I offer some observations on ten salient and various book-historical topics. Although some of the examples come from a particular book-history project, I attempt to raise more general concerns of wider applicability in the hope that presenting this salmagundi of problems and possibilities will stimulate further reflection and discussion among—and indeed between—bibliographers and book historians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. The Interdisciplinary Nature of Book History Writing in 1977, the distinguished Blake scholar Morris Eaves sought to combat the "parochialism" that characterized the study of publishing history by promoting a "comprehensive view that can see a fact in its context, even when that context violates the boundaries of specialized areas of knowledge." 2 2. Morris Eaves, "What Is `The History of Publishing'?," Publishing History 2 (1977), 57-77 [pp. 76-77]. The difficulties attendant upon such interdisciplinarity notwithstanding, Eaves advocated a Janus-like program of research, affirming "that historians of publishing have a right and a duty to set their sights very high, working in decades to come towards a comprehensive history that looks both inwards and outwards." We must direct our scholarly attentions "inwards towards a more precise account of the everyday facts of buyers, sellers, and products" so that our knowledge of book history is adequately grounded in close investigation of the historical record. Yet, we also bear a concomitant obligation to marshal our intellectual energies "outwards towards a more comprehensive account of publishing in its evolution as part of a large history that includes all the aspects of culture that affect and are affected by publishing " (77). Though highly ambitious, this second aspect of Eaves' twin remit is by no means eccentric, and has long been considered a basic tenet of book-historical inquiry. When some of the most consequential scholars pursuing such studies gathered in June 1980 to produce a "Statement on the History of the Book," their manifesto acknowledged the difficulty and the centrality of addressing the impact that books have made on society—and the influence that society has had on the making of books. "The history of the book is fundamental to the historical study of society," they declare, "but we are far from understanding the factors that have shaped the writing and the dissemination of books." Emphasizing the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the book and culture, they insist "These factors have changed over time and have varied from one cultural area to another; hence the impact of the book has also been ever-varied and changing." 3 3. Kenneth E. Carpenter, ed., Books and Society in History: Papers of the Association of College and Research Libraries Rare Books and Manuscripts Preconference 24-28 June, 1980, Boston. MA (New York: R. R. Bowker, 1983), pp. xi-xii [p. xi]. The exigencies of book-historical research accordingly appear to require a range of specialized knowledge that is genuinely intimidating. "Consider the demands on the book historian today," Robert Darnton invites us. First, he or she must command a variety of expertise about the businesses of the book trade: "know[ing] how to make paper, cast type, impose formes, operate presses, correct copy, keep accounts, ship freight, place advertisements, collect bills, satisfy readers and pacify authors." And he or she "must master the variations of those activities at different stages in the evolution of technology and business practices." Fair enough. If this were all, if knowledge of bibliography and the operations of the trades were sufficient, then "the demands on the book historian today" would be ample, but not excessive. Yet, Darnton reminds us that, if we are to attend to the larger purview of book history, then we also "must keep up with the latest varieties of bibliography, library science, literary criticism, sociology, history and economics." 4 4. Robert Darnton, "Histoire du livre, Geschichte des Buchwesens: An Agenda for Comparative History," Publishing History 22 (1987), 33-41 [p. 33]. The scope of knowledge required of those who undertake book-historical research is so broad in part because books "refuse to be contained within the confines of a single discipline when treated as objects of study. Neither history nor literature nor economics nor sociology nor bibliography can do justice to all the aspects of the life of a book." According to Darnton, "By its very nature, therefore, the history of books must be . . . interdisciplinary in method." 5 5. Robert Darnton, "What Is the History of Books?," in his The Kiss of Lamourette (London: Faber and Faber, 1990), pp. 107-135 [p. 135]; originally in Daedalus 111 (Summer 1982), 65-83. Cf. Joan Shelley Rubin's reflections on book history from a more recent and chiefly American context, "What Is the History of the History of Books?," The Journal of American History 90.2 (Sept. 2003), 555-575. Kevin Sharpe recognizes that many scholars "do not always feel at home with sociologists and Annaliste historians, let alone critical theorists," but nevertheless also argues that book history must incorporate a variety of disciplines because "certain types of historical enquiry . . . need to be an interdisciplinary endeavour." 6 6. Kevin Sharpe, Reading Revolutions: The Politics of Reading in Early Modern England (New Haven and London: Yale Univ. Press, 2000), p. 39. On the contributions of the Annaliste school to book history, see Wallace Kirsop, "Literary History and Book Trade History: The Lesson of L'Apparition du livre, " Australian Journal of French Studies 16 (1979), 488-535. Peter D. McDonald so thoroughly insists on the interdisciplinarity of book history that he decries attempts to institutionalize book-historical scholarship into a formalized academic discipline, preferring instead to emphasize the fluidity of its method: "Bokhistorie er en tverrfaglig undersøkelsesmodus og ikke en `disiplin', et skjæringspunkt og ikke et sted." ["Book history is an interdisciplinary mode of inquiry, not a `discipline', an intersection not a place."] 7 7. Peter D. McDonald, "Bokhistorie og disiplinmisunnelse" ["Book history and discipline envy"], in Tore Rem, ed., Bokhistorie (Oslo: Gyldendal, 2003), pp. 71-81 [p. 73]. The consensus among book historians that the nature of texts and the aims of contemporary scholarly inquiry require more than a passing knowledge of several academic disciplines does not alter the fact that most practitioners of book history received their professional training in one, or at most two, disciplines. Thomas Adams and Nicolas Barker have keenly observed, "The passage of the old bibliography to the new history of the book is not simple: it is accompanied by an abrupt change from a reductionist to a maximalist philosophy." 8 8. Thomas R. Adams and Nicolas Barker, "A New Model for the Study of the Book," in A Potencie of Life: Books in Society, The Clark Lectures, 1986-1987, ed. Nicolas Barker (1993; repr. London: British Library, 2001), pp. 5-43 [p. 39]. Cf. the home page for The Centre for the History of the Book, Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, The University of Edinburgh, "BOOK HISTORY is an area of interdisciplinary enquiry, drawing on the methods of Bibliography, Social History, Literary Criticism, and Cultural Theory. Its specific objects of study include literacy and reading practices, relations among publishers, authors, and readers, and media production technology." &lt;http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/ chb/&gt;; consulted 15 April 2004. Yet, most of us have been prepared—both by our education and by the demands of the profession— for intellectual undertakings more appropriately described as minimalist. Although there certainly are notable exceptions, most book-historical scholarship published since the first issue of Publishing History appeared in 1976 has not been authentically interdisciplinary. In book history, as elsewhere , interdisciplinarity too often means doing more than one thing inadequately , the gesture of tacking on a few purloined paragraphs to satisfy a notional demand, a shallow obeisance to subjects the investigator does not genuinely know. No wonder that in an important review, "History of the Book: An Undisciplined Discipline?," Cyndia Clegg appropriately admonishes us: to practice interdisciplinary scholarship requires more than becoming conversant in the recent literature of another discipline; it requires a certain humility in the face of long traditions of bibliographic, historiographic, and critical practice, and a willingness to acknowledge and incorporate these precedents along with often unaccustomed methodologies. 9 9. Cyndia Susan Clegg, "History of the Book: An Undisciplined Discipline?," Renaissance Quarterly 54 (2001), 221-245 [p. 245]. Cf. Stanley Fish, "Being Interdisciplinary Is So Very Hard to Do," Profession (1989), 15-22. "Integration," with its cognate "integrity," should be a principal characteristic of our interdisciplinary endeavors, informing the answers we provide and, most importantly. the questions we pose. The Introduction to the first number of Book History, an annual produced under the auspices of SHARP, enthusiastically declares that the history of the book "is a new kind of history," "that book history is information history," and "that book history provides a more rigorous and empirical approach to such issues as reader response, canon formation, and the politics of literary criticism." 10 10. Ezra Greenspan and Jonathan Rose, "An Introduction to Book History," Book History 1 (1998), ix-xi [p. x]. Although the editors, both accomplished book historians themselves, promise "new perspectives and innovative methods," they discuss neither historiography nor any of the analytical, historical, sociological , or critical methods by which this new kind of historical investigation might be conducted to produce scholarship of a standard allowing them to "promise . . . that every issue of this journal will . . . change the way we read words on paper" (xi). Almost everywhere in this area of scholarly endeavor there is much Panglossian confidence and little facing up to the stark realities of how little we know and how much we need to think deeply about what we are doing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Periodization How do the time periods we routinely use to demarcate our book-historical investigations shape our understandings by opening up certain perspectives while foreclosing others? The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 5 begins with a specific event, the lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695, and ends with the generalized marker of 1830, a date that serves as a terminus ad quem by which the industrialization of the book is firmly established. Thus, CHBB5 chronicles the proliferation of print, the rise of what Samuel Johnson called "the common reader," and the efflorescence of a thoroughgoing "print culture" in Britain. One practical problem we have encountered is that very few scholars are comfortable covering the whole period 16951830 ; many students of the eighteenth century do not dare to trespass beyond the French Revolution, or 1800, or the start of George IV's Regency in 1811. Of course, this difficulty obtains in the other direction as well: scholars of the "Romantic Age" (roughly, 1789-1832) are typically loathe to delve into the early or mid eighteenth century. Periodization is a practical matter, of course, but it also profoundly influences how groups of scholars conceptualize and write about developments in the production, distribution, and reception of printed matter. Just as the periodization of literary history has had a thoroughgoing effect on how that subject is researched, taught, studied, and understood, so too do the ways in which we partition book history, both national and international, have a significant impact on future patterns of perception and knowledge. In The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain we have sometimes selected boundaries based on particularly significant legal developments (e.g., the granting of the royal charter to the Stationers' Company in 1557 and the lapse of Licensing), sometimes delineated major changes in the conduct of the book trade (such as the industrialization of book production), and sometimes chosen temporal limits rooted in a more general heuristic purpose (e.g., 1400 "when Geoffrey Chaucer died" for the start of Volume 3. or 2000 for the end of Volume 7 and the History itself). 11 11. Lotte Hellinga and J. B. Trapp, eds., The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 3, 1400-1557 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999), p. 1. All this seems straightforward enough. Yet, mindful that the forms our questions take often dictate the nature of the answers we develop, it may be salutary to interrogate the matter of periodization in book history, if only as a means of revealing our tacit assumptions and often-unarticulated biases. Every period construction necessarily promotes certain kinds of observations while obscuring others. One way of thinking about periods might be to give more consideration to the kinds of books being produced. If, for example, religious and theological works overwhelmingly constitute the largest category of publishing activity for the first three centuries of printing, then should ecclesiastical and theological developments and events not enter more fully into delineating our concepts of print culture in the hand-press period? Neither Shakespeare nor Pope, but John Wesley, is the most published individual author in eighteenth-century Britain, while the best-selling corporate works are, of course, the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. 12 12. The author with the greatest number of editions 1701-1800 is John Wesley, with 1,168, exceeding even Shakespeare, who is credited with 1,044. See &lt;http://www.cbsr.ucr. edu/ESTC charts/ESTC Slide13.html&gt;; consulted 4 June 2003. For play texts, it might well make sense to consider the so-called "long Restoration" from the reopening of the theaters in 1660 to the establishment of stage licensing in 1737. Such a category could help book historians discern more clearly the complex relationships between dramatic productions of the stage and the production and publishing of the dramatic page. Practitioners of book history have often adhered to traditional divisons operative in either literary or political history because we have inherited these temporal categories as a consequence of our professional training. Yet, it is by no means clear how the reign of Queen Victoria—or, as some prefer, the interval from the passage of the Reform Act (1832) to the accession of Edward VIII (1901)—is especially meaningful for book history as an investigative tool for framing our inquiries, however well it may serve as an heuristic expedient. As we strive to move toward more international histories of the book, should we use wars, or treaties bearing on trade, or the invention of technologies to demarcate the field? Employing technological milestones seems especially appealing, at least for pan-European book history, though such markers in a global context are of limited utility during most of the history of printing . For certain kinds of works, thinking about the timeframes of international , intellectual, or cultural history can help book historians to cross new boundaries and consider their subjects from a fresh perspective. The notion of the Romantic century, 1750-1850, for example, could stimulate new research. 13 13. See Susan J. Wolfson, ed., "The Romantic Century: A Forum," European Romantic Review 11 (2000), 1-45. Considering the ways that book histories might be most helpfully partitioned, we may decide that national histories ought to be rich with "thick description" that attends closely to the significance of local events and circumstances, while international accounts could reasonably adhere to a different chronology in seeking to establish a more capacious view. 14 14. Clifford Geertz, "Thick Description: Toward an Interpretative Theory of Culture," in his The Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973), pp. 3-30. As Geertz attests [p. 6], the concept originates in the work of Gilbert Ryle. See also Geertz, Local Knowledge (New York: Basic Books, 1983). There is a sizeable body of scholarly literature on periodization, but book historians have generally seemed unconcerned about how the partitioning of history affects our perceptions and conditions our understandings . 15 15.

One instance of a temporal boundary that has had a profound effect on scholarly research and the structure of our investigations is the decision to terminate the English Short-Title Catalogue at 1800, thereby forestalling the possibility of our having a comprehensive bibliography of the hand-press book in Britain. 16 16. For an illuminating collection of essays on the history, development, and use of the ESTC, see Henry L. Snyder and Michael S. Smith, eds., The English Short-Title Catalogue: Past, Present, Future (New York: AMS Press, 2003). The consequent lack of bibliographical control for 18011830 vitiates scholars' ability to understand more fully the impact of many significant developments on the book trade, including: government censorship of the press as a response to Radicalism; changes in banking and credit arrangements that fostered the shift from bookselling to publishing; and technological innovations such as stereotyping, lithography, the advent of iron presses (Stanhope, Columbian, Albion, etc.), and the mechanization of paper production. It is a lamentable reality that virtually all the statistical data presented in CHBB5 necessarily terminates in 1800. The Nineteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue, based on radically different principles than the ESTC, does not pretend to the same inclusiveness and is particularly weak in provincial printing, which in the decades under discussion accounts for the production of vast numbers of titles. 17 17. Our best estimate of publishing activity 1801-1830 is found in Simon Eliot, Some Patterns and Trends in British Publishing 1800-1919, Occasional Papers of the Bibliographical Society, Number 8 (London: Bibliographical Society, 1994).

      <field name="fulltext">3. Boundaries If temporal borders have a significant impact upon the ways we think about the histories of printing and publishing, of authorship and reading, then what other kinds of boundaries might help to construct and circumscribe our understandings? As editors of CHBB5, we have had to consider a variety of questions concerning additional boundaries: national, geographical, cultural , legal, linguistic, and economic. (For disciplinary and temporal thresholds , see sections 1 and 2 above.) There is a history of the book in Wales; 18 18. Philip Henry Jones and Eiluned Rees, eds., A Nation and its Books: A History of the Book in Wales (Aberystwyth: National Library of Wales, 1998). the four-volume History of the Book in Scotland is in progress, 19 19. Bill Bell and Jonquil Bevan, gen. eds., A History of the Book in Scotland, 4 vols. (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univ. Press, in progress). The volumes are divided as follows: 1. Origins to 1707; 2. 1707-1800; 3. 1800-1880; 4. 1880-1980. as is a History of the Irish Book. 20 20. Brian Walker and Robert Welch, gen. eds., A History of the Irish Book, 5 vols. (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, in progress). Volumes 3-5 cover "The Irish Book in English" and span the periods 1550-1800, 1800-1900, and 1900-2000. Nevertheless, the Cambridge series is presumptuously called The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain. 21 21. For the record, it should be noted that the general and volume editors wanted the indefinite article— A History of the Book—but the Press insisted that it be The History. CHBB5, to varying degrees, takes cognizance of the book in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, although—because of constraints on the size of our printed volume— nowhere is the attention devoted to these regions as extensive as the editors desired. In much the same way, CHBB5 includes articles on the British book in North America and in India, but, as the first volume of A History of the Book in America, The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World tantalizingly suggests, there is a great deal more that might usefully have been said from the British perspective about the traffic in books and cultural consumption. 22 22. Hugh Amory and David D. Hall, eds., A History of the Book in America, Volume 1, The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000). Perhaps the most challenging boundaries we as editors have had to negotiate are those imposed by the limitations of space in a single-volume printed book (see section 10 below). Robert Darnton has rightly observed that "books themselves do not respect limits either linguistic or national," 23 23. Darnton, "What Is the History of Books?," p. 135. but the reader of CHBB5 will perceive that our geographical reach has been effectively constrained by the boundaries of a physical book. Despite Darnton's assertion in 1982 that "By its very nature . . . the history of books must be international in scale and interdisciplinary in method," most book-historical research in the past twenty-odd years has been genuinely neither. 24 24. Darnton, "What Is the History of Books?," p. 135. For a useful survey of book-historical scholarship to 1997, see Jonathan Rose, "The History of Books: Revised and Enlarged," in The Darnton Debate: Books and Revolution in the Eighteenth Century, ed. Hayden T. Mason (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1998), pp. 83-104. See also Ian R. Willison, "Remarks on the History of the Book in Britain as a Field of Study within the Humanities, With a Synopsis and Select List of Current Literature," in Essays in Honor of William B. Todd, comp. Warner Barnes and Larry Carver, ed.

Bernhard Fabian (Hildesheim and New York: Olms-Weidmann, 1996), pp. 93-120. Writing five years after making his initial declaration, Darnton acknowledged that "the history of the book . . . faces a danger that has restricted the development of other disciplines: nationalization," and urged book historians to "study concrete problems in a comparative manner" that cuts across the boundaries of the nation-state in order to do justice to an object of study that is "international by nature." 25 25. Darnton, "Histoire du livre, Geschichte des Buchwesens," p. 33. See also Robert A. Gross, "Books, Nationalism, and History," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 36 (1998), 107-123. Darnton was by no means the first to affirm that, because books cross borders, book history must do so as well. The 1980 "Statement on the History of the Book" produced at the Association of College and Research Libraries' Rare Books and Manuscripts Preconference observed that "since the book is by its nature a cultural force that transcends national boundaries, both the design and compilation of basic tools require international cooperation." 26 26. Carpenter, ed., Books and Society in History, p. xi. The development of the English Short-Title Catalogue has been an outstanding instance of such international collaboration. See Snyder and Smith, eds., The English Short-Title Catalogue: Past, Present, Future, especially pp. 3-18, 45-63, and 105-154. The tremendous amount of scholarship on national histories of the book that has been published, or is now in progress, may make international book history on a broad scale genuinely feasible for the first time. When read together, such national histories will enable more comparative scholarship across traditional boundaries, a development that bodes well for the future of the field. National histories of the book will also promote international book history by underscoring the degree to which the book trade in any individual country has been allied to the business of books elsewhere. The last two volumes of The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, covering the years 1830-2000, will be global in their reach, but even earlier volumes in the series have necessarily emphasized the importance of international commerce in the conduct of the book trade. From the time that Caxton printed the first book on English soil in 1477 until the early decades of the eighteenth century, most of the paper and type used in the manufacture of English books was imported from the Continent. The experience of Caxton himself, working as a printer in Cologne and Bruges, reminds us too that book trade personnel also frequently crossed international boundaries. Of course, part of the story that CHBB5 has to tell is how England in the eighteenth century went from being heavily dependent on imported books to developing a thriving trade in books for foreign and colonial export. When considering the British book trade, one might also usefully think about the borders and boundaries—geographical, political, financial, and technological—that obtained within the country itself, not least the role of London in relation to the provinces, even after the lapse of Licensing in 1695. For the Renaissance and eighteenth century, it may be useful when thinking about the provincial book trade in Britain to apply a modified version of the "internal colony" paradigm proposed in a different context by Robert Blauner and Michael Hechter. 27 27. Robert Blauner, Racial Oppression in America (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), and Michael Hechter, Internal Colonialism (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1975). See also E. San Juan, Beyond Postcolonial Theory (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998). Still another boundary concerns the kinds of books we study. In book-historical studies of the hand-press period, and in book history more generally , literary texts have been investigated out of all proportion to their representation in the marketplace. The program for the Annual Meeting of SHARP in July 2003 (at Scripps College in Claremont, California) may be taken as generally representative of the work being done by SHARP members and may therefore be used as a convenient snapshot of current research activity among (mostly British and American) practitioners of book history. The range of topics covered was genuinely impressive; yet, approximately thirty-seven percent of the papers delivered in the panel sessions were directly concerned with literary topics: chiefly the publishing or reading of fiction, poetry, and drama. 28 28. &lt;http://sharpweb.org/sharp2003program.html&gt;; consulted 10 March 2004. Given that most scholars conducting book-historical investigations come from literary studies, this tendency toward imaginative literature is understandable, but it may reasonably provoke us to ask, to what extent do `literary' concerns determine the dominant practices in book history? To what extent is this belletristic emphasis desirable? Book history is not literary history; literature, as traditionally conceived, constitutes a relatively small percentage of the books printed in the eighteenth century. In 1753, for example, literary works in English from all genres comprised about 11 percent of all surviving published titles. In the same year, books on religion and theology made up some 21 percent of published works, and writings on government some 20 percent. Nevertheless, such genres are seldom the subject of book-historical investigations. Similarly, the deluge of print necessary for the conduct of business is typically neglected in book-historical studies. 29 29. See John J. McCusker, "The Business Press in England Before 1775," Essays in the Economic History of the Atlantic World (London and New York: Routledge, 1997), pp. 145-176; and McCusker, European Bills of Entry and Marine Lists: Early Commercial Publications and the Origins of the Business Press (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1985). Cf. McCusker and Cora Gravestijn, The Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism : The Commodity Price Currents, Exchange Rate Currents, and Money Currents of Early Modern Europe, Netherlandsch Economisch-Historisch Archief, ser. III, no. 11 (Amsterdam: Nederlandsch Economisch-Historisch Archief, 1991). It seems that the reluctance of many book historians to traverse disciplinary borders by directing their investigations outside the literary field may in time have a much more far-reaching effect on the practice of book history than the difficulties presented by the prospect of negotiating any other boundary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The Sociology of Texts As every pioneer well knows, crossing borders and venturing into new territories can be a difficult and dangerous undertaking. When D. F. McKenzie delivered the inaugural Panizzi Lectures, "Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts," in 1985 at the British Library, it was his application of sociology to bibliography that attracted attention, both pro and con. McKenzie's marshalling of these conjoined disciplinary perspectives was hardly new, however . He first used the concept, "the sociology of the text," and began to develop the idea as a component of his revisionist program in the second of his Sandars Lectures in 1976, 30 30. "The London Book Trade in the Later Seventeenth Century." Unpublished typescript of the Sandars Lectures for 1975-76. Distributed privately; copies deposited in the British Library; the English Faculty Library, Oxford; and the University Library, Cambridge . making further applications in "Typography and Meaning: the Case of William Congreve" (delivered in 1977, but not published until 1981). 31 31. D. F. McKenzie, "Typography and Meaning: The Case of William Congreve," in Giles Barber and Bernhard Fabian, eds., Buch und Buchhandel in Europa in achtzehnten Jahrhundert, Wolfenbütteler Schriften zur Geschichte des Buchwesens, Band 4 (Hamburg: Hauswedell, 1981), pp. 81-125. Reprinted in McKenzie, Making Meaning: "Printers of the Mind" and Other Essays, ed. Peter D. McDonald and Michael F. Suarez, S.J. (Amherst and Boston: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 2002), pp. 198-236. "Type-Bound Topography" (1982) and his 1983 Presidential Address to the Bibliographical Society both enlarged and extended his intellectual project well before the Panizzi Lectures were established. 32 32. "Type-Bound Topography," Times Literary Supplement (17 December 1982), 1403; "The Sociology of the Text: Orality, Literacy and Print in Early New Zealand," Library 6th ser. 6 (1984), 333-365. A revised version was published as Oral Culture, Literacy &amp; Print in Early New Zealand: The Treaty of Waitangi (Wellington: Victoria Univ. Press, 1985). In his first lecture, McKenzie—expert bibliographer, printing historian, and chronicler of apprentices' entrance into the Stationers' Company—explained in summary fashion the necessary elements for conducting a sociology of texts, first by invoking some fundamental principles from Herbert Spencer's classic work, The Study of Sociology (1873): " `Sociology has to recognize truths of social development, structure, and function.' " 33 33. D. F. McKenzie, Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts, rev. ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999), p. 14. Dilating on Spencer's text, McKenzie then commented: As I see it, that stress on structure and function is important. . . . At one level, a sociology simply reminds us of the full range of social relations which the medium of print had to serve, from receipt blanks to bibles. But it also directs us to consider the human motives and interactions which texts involve at every stage of their production, transmission, and consumption. It alerts us to the roles of institutions, and their own complex structures, in affecting the forms of social discourse, past and present. (p. 15) Although it would be a gross oversimplification to suggest that the marrying of sociology to bibliography produces the offspring of book history, it is nevertheless true that an amicable and generative partnership between these subjects is essential if the nascent interdisciplinary endeavor we call "the history of the book" is to mature toward its full potential. Because the future stature of book history depends upon the accommodation—if not the integration—of these two disciplines in scholarly research, it is deeply worrying that at present most of us currently undertaking book-historical investigations are not truly conversant, much less genuinely adept, in either bibliography or sociology. Believing that such an emphasis is consonant with McKenzie's intentions and achievements, it seems both fitting and constructive to stress the "and" in the title of the last book he published in his lifetime: Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts. 34 34. The resistance of some senior bibliographers to this broader remit is evinced, in part, in two highly critical reviews of McKenzie's Panizzi Lectures: T. H. Howard-Hill, Library 6th ser. 10 (1988), 151-158; and G. Thomas Tanselle, "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," Studies in Bibliography 44 (1991), 83-143 [pp. 87-99]. Other scholars warmly endorsed McKenzie's program—see, for example, Roger Chartier, "Texts, Forms, and Interpretations," in his On the Edge of the Cliff: History, Language, and Practices (Baltimore : Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1997), pp. 81-89. Yet, McKenzie himself never developed the sociological program he inaugurated with the thoroughness that one might have hoped for, so that Hugh Amory's critique—" `Sociology', so conceived, has . . . apparently, no methodological content"—must be accepted as an insightful diagnosis. 35 35. Hugh Amory, review of D. F. McKenzie, Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts, The Panizzi Lectures 1985 (London: British Library, 1986) in Book Collector 36 (1987), 411-418 [p. 413]. If the `sociology' in our evolving understanding of the sociology of texts is to be more than a generalized marker for vague and uncritically examined notions of social exchange, then perhaps would-be students of book history would do well to read Anthony Giddens' New Rules of Sociological Method. Chapter 4, "The Form of Explanatory Accounts," which, among other matters , treats "[t]he problem of adequacy," is particularly apposite. 36 36. Anthony Giddens, New Rules of Sociological Method, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1993), pp. 155-162. Generally speaking, Giddens proposes a model of sociological analysis that focuses on "the reproduction of practices." Rejecting the simplistic "dualism of `the individual ' and `society'," he understands social structure as "both constituted by human agency and yet . . . at the same time the very medium of this constitution " (128-129). Giddens thus attempts to develop a sociological method that accounts both for individual human beings as purposive agents and for the larger forms of social life that their actions reproduce and transform. 37 37. For critiques of Giddens' method, see Nicos P. Mouzelis, Back to Sociological Theory: The Construction of Social Orders (London: Macmillan, 1991), a stimulating work in its own right; and Hans Harbers and Gerard de Vries, "Empirical Consequences of the `Double Hermeneutic'," Social Epistemology 7 (1993), 183-193 (with comments and replies, 193-211). More generally, see David Held and John B. Thompson, eds., Social Theory of Modern Societies: Anthony Giddens and his Critics (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989). Giddens' Central Problems in Social Theory (1979) provides an especially illuminating example of a thoughtfully developed sociological method. 38 38. Giddens, Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure and Contradiction in Social Analysis (London: Macmillan, 1979). For a bibliography of works on Giddens' theories and of studies that use them, see Christopher G. A. Bryant and David Jary, The Contemporary Giddens (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001), pp. 287-320. The sociology of texts should begin in the study of the practices and institutions of textual production, transmission, and reception. Such a sociology perforce involves the investigation of economic determinants, aesthetic conventions , and ideological factors as it seeks to understand and interpret the roles of print in the construction and maintenance of social practices and institutions. Books are the products of social processes—sometimes represented as "the communications circuit" or "the literary field"—and they participate in social processes far beyond those associated with textual production and transmission. 39 39. For the "communications circuit" in various manifestations, see Darnton, "What Is the History of Books?," pp. 107-135; Darnton, "Histoire du livre, Geschichte des Buchwesens ," pp. 33-41; and Adams and Barker, "A New Model for the Study of the Book," pp. 5-43. On the "literary field" see Pierre Bourdieu, The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature, ed. Randal Johnson (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1993). For a productive synthesis involving both of these constructs, see Peter D. McDonald, " Implicit Structures and Explicit Interactions: Pierre Bourdieu and the History of the Book," Library 6th ser. 19 (1997), 105-121. Cf. Janet Wolff, The Social Production of Art, 2nd ed. (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1993), pp. 26-48. A sociology of texts should also seek a deeper understanding of how the practices and institutions of textual production, transmission, and reception are imbedded in and informed by larger social and political structures. Moreover, such a sociology must always recognize that print culture at once instantiates and is instantiated by the larger culture of which it is a part. Hence, it is sometimes characterized as "an index of civilisation." 40 40.

For a critique of the concept of print culture, see the first chapter of Joseph A. Dane, The Myth of Print Culture: Essays on Evidence, Textuality, and Bibliographical Method (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 2003). Book historians have already begun to cultivate a sociology of knowledge and its allied discipline, the history of ideas—surely a hopeful development indicative of greater things to come from recognizing the usefulness of the social sciences for the investigation and analysis of the worlds of print. 41 41. Among the seminal Anglo-American studies are: Hajo Holborn, "The History of Ideas," American Historical Review 73 (1968), 683-695; Quentin Skinner, "Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas," History and Theory 8 (1969), 1-53; and Hayden White, "The Tasks of Intellectual History," The Monist 53 (1969), 606-630.

Petras, eds., The Sociology of Knowledge: A Reader (London: Duckworth &amp; Co., 1970), is a useful sourcebook.

      <field name="fulltext">5. The Role of Bibliography in Book History How can scholars effectively traverse the intellectual divide between bibliography and book history? What cargoes might be traded between these territories to the benefit of both? In CHBB5 we have wrestled with questions about the use and display of bibliographical information of various kinds, as well as with larger concerns about the relationship between particular observations and more far-reaching analysis. In any history that gestures toward comprehensiveness, there is an inevitable tension between the communication of knowledge and the limited provision of the information from which it is derived. A still more important matter, however, is the role that bibliography should play in book-historical research. In a thought-provoking paper, T. H. Howard-Hill has asked, "What is the contribution of bibliography to the history of the book?" His answer, in part, is that bibliography enables "already historically-sensitive book historians to attend to the physiscal object in history." 45 45. T. H. Howard-Hill, "Bibliography and the History of the Book," typescript of an as-yet-unpublished plenary lecture delivered at the annual meeting of SHARP, University of London, July 2002. This understanding accords well with the 1980 "Statement on the History of the Book" in which leading book historians situated bibliographical scholarship at the center of book-historical research. "The attempt to understand the influence of changes in book production and dissemination is particularly demanding," they observed. "In the first place, one needs to know the basic facts of what was printed, by whom and for whom," but beyond such fundamental investigations there is also a great deal of exacting bibliographical work to be done, because "[d]etailed bibliographic studies, dictionaries of printers, and inventories of both public and private libraries are among the time-consuming and exacting and fundamental studies that are needed." 46 46. Carpenter, ed., Books and Society in History, p. xi. Assessing the current state of book history in The Journal of American History, Joan Shelley Rubin remarks, "Bibliography remains important." 47 47. Rubin, "What Is the History of the History of Books," p. 557. David Hall offers a more personal testimony, "My education at the hands of the bibliographers is ongoing." 48 48. David D. Hall, Cultures of Print: Essays in the History of the Book (Amherst, MA: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1996), p. 8. Nevertheless, the relationship between bibliography and book history is sometimes characterized by vexing ambiguities and competing demands. Hall has recorded that at a scholarly meeting he attended, "The most explicit disagreement concerned texts and their transmittal: to what extent should historians undertake bibliographical research before they can proceed in confidence? Meanwhile, it was suggested that bibliographers put their skills to work answering questions of importance to historians. . . . This exchange of expectations might not have satisfied either party. . . ." 49 49. David D. Hall, "A Report on the 1984 Conference on Needs and Opportunities in the History of the Book in American Culture," in Needs and Opportunities in the History of the Book: America, 1639-1876, ed. David D. Hall and John B. Hench (Worcester: American Antiquarian Society, 1987), p. 11. One problem facing book-historical studies is that many scholars have an inadequate grounding in bibliography. It seems reasonable to propose that bibliographical literacy ought to be requisite to book history in the way that all physicians—whether surgeons, research immunologists, or epidemiologists—have studied human anatomy. Yet, it remains a disturbing truth that most of us engaged in book-historical scholarship received no bibliographical training as part of our graduate studies. The results when historians of the book are, apparently, ignorant of bibliographical rudiments can be memorably infelicitous. One celebrated scholar recently made much ado about the reprinting of a poetic miscellany many years after its first appearance, adducing from the title page strong evidence of the original edition's aesthetic and commercial success. Regrettably, however, the "new edition" was merely a reissue of sheets that had long been in storage. Such elementary oversights not only bring down individual arguments, they also potentially compromise the integrity and reputation of book historical research as a mode of inquiry. G. Thomas Tanselle, delivering a lecture on "The History of Books as a Field of Study," observed that "The kind of work now labeled ` histoire du livre ' [which Tanselle characterizes as "the study of the role of printed books in society"] and the kind called `analytical bibliography' [that is, the scholarly investigation of "the printing history of individual books"] may be for the most part associated with different groups of people, but both will be less fruitful than they might be if they develop as independent disciplines ." 50 50. G. Thomas Tanselle, "The History of Books as a Field of Study," The Second Hanes Lecture, presented April 15, 1981 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in Tanselle, Literature and Artifacts (Charlottesville: The Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1998), 41-55 [pp. 48-49]. A dialogue between these two areas of inquiry would contribute to book history because the "connection between physical detail [bibliographical signs] and intellectual content, between analytical bibliography and textual meaning, has a logical bearing on the role of books in society" (54, 53). Tanselle is right to acknowledge that " both will be less fruitful," and so it is helpful to emphasize that book history might also enrich analytical (and other varieties of) bibliography as well, since the observation and analysis of bibliographic codes are always interpretative acts. Like book history, bibliography—whether descriptive, analytical, enumerative, historical, or physical—is invariably a critical and critically-laden exercise in historical interpretation. It is critical in the root-sense of the word: bibliography requires the repeated exercise of informed judgment. Concomitantly, knowledge about the production and transmission of individual works (or, in McKenzie's and McGann's terms, of the particular texts of a work), 51 51. D. F. McKenzie, "Typography and Meaning: The Case of William Congreve," pp. 85, 106, and n. 42 [pp. 206, 223, and n. 42 in Making Meaning ]; Jerome J. McGann, The Textual Condition (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991), pp. 163-164; cf. Jerome J. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983; repr. Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1992), pp. 92-93. often the fundamental stuff of bibliography, can be essential to the conduct of intellectually rigorous book history. One of the primary lessons at the intersection of bibliography and book history is that "intellectual content" might not be so easily equated with "textual meaning" apart from all other bibliographic codes in the text, because the book is a complex system of signifiers, all of which contribute to the ways in which meaning is made. 52 52. See McGann, The Textual Condition, where he argues that a text is best understood as "a laced network of linguistic and bibliographical codes" (13). Cf. McKenzie, "Typography and Meaning: The Case of William Congreve." In this regard , the idea of the book as a volume ( volumen ), a capacious container of many and varied codes, is particularly appealing. The rigorous and creative application of bibliographical knowledge to book-historical research is, in my view, the single most important desideratum for book history today. It is difficult to imagine how a sociology of texts that does not integrate the contributions of bibliography could make an important and lasting contribution to book history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. Understanding What the Gaps in Our Knowledge Might Mean When in the late 1980s D. F. McKenzie first proposed the idea of undertaking a multi-volume history of the book in Britain, a number of colleagues wondered whether the state of our knowledge was as yet sufficiently advanced for such a project. 53 53. Cf. Penny Griffith, Ross Harvey, and Keith Maslen, eds., Book and Print in New Zealand: A Guide to Print Culture in Aotearoa (Wellington: Victoria Univ. Press, 1997): "A major history is some years away. Such a work of synthesis must be based on a sufficient foundation of systematic research, and this foundation has yet to be laid" (p. 13). Some fifteen years later, the question is still highly appropriate . The lacunae in CHBB5 are far from trivial. They include: the sale of Irish books in Northern England, especially post 1760; the market for Scottish books in Ireland; the importation of books to the colonies from Scotland, Northern England, and Ireland; and a range of issues concerning piracy (discussed in section 7, below). Although some chapters in the volume reflect outstanding scholarly achievement, others—often of no less merit—indicate that many more specialist studies are needed. Nevertheless, it is the hope of the General Editors and of the volume editors that book history will benefit from the Cambridge History both as a source of knowledge and as a stimulus to further investigation. In The Literary Underground of the Old Regime, Robert Darnton indicates that "we need to know more about the world behind the books" and offers an important series of questions that would help lead book historians to that knowledge: How did writers pursue careers in the Republic of Letters? Did their economic and social condition have much effect on their writing? How did publishers and booksellers operate? Did their ways of doing business influence the literary fare that reached their customers? What was that literature? Who were its readers? And how did they read? 54 54. Darnton, The Literary Underground of the Old Regime (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1982), pp. ix, viii-ix. Commenting on Darnton's professed ignorance, John Sutherland is regrettably imperceptive when he claims, "This questionnaire tacitly admits to vast areas of academic incompetence." 55 55. John Sutherland, "Publishing History: A Hole at the Centre of Literary Sociology," Critical Inquiry 14 (1988), 574-589 [p. 575]. Book historians—perhaps more than researchers in traditional fields or even in longer-established interdisciplinary approaches—should be mindful of avoiding the "Sutherland syndrome": a false belief that the admission of ignorance ought automatically be equated with incompetence. In the case of Darnton, the charge is absurd. The real danger, however, is that book historians—either suffering from the syndrome, or fearing the aspersions of those who are afflicted—will themselves be inclined neither to admit publicly what they do not know, nor distinguish among the several causes of their nescience. As I see it, there are three principal classes to consider: 1) errors of perception , synthesis or analysis, or the failure to adduce what is already known; in such cases the investigator is ordinarily unaware of his or her ignorance; 2) a lack of knowledge that points toward future research which seems tractable, but has yet to be undertaken; 56 56. In the machine press period, some highly desirable research projects—a nineteenth-century enumerative bibliography created to the same standards as the ESTC, for example— have been considered impracticable because of the surfeit of information to be treated in the hundreds of thousands of books that survive. and 3) ignorance arising from gaps in the historical record—surviving documentation is so often incomplete and much that we would be delighted to study is wholly absent. The destruction of vital Stationers' Company records in "the Blitz" of 1940 is merely a recent instance of such losses attributable to a variety of causes, including: the Great Fire of London in 1666; the intentional destruction of correspondence (as when James Dodsley burned the letters of his bookselling brother, Robert); the use of old business documents as wastepaper for bookbinding ; and the sacrifice of old letters and ledgers as "Martyrs of Pies and Reliques of the Bum." 57 57. John Dryden, Mac Flecknoe (1682), line 101. It does us no good to mourn for all that is lost, however, any more than it did for Thomasina Coverly to weep for the library at Alexandria in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia. 58 58. Tom Stoppard, Arcadia (London: Faber and Faber, 1993), p. 38 [Act I, scene iii]. Instead, scholars do a service to their colleagues, present and future, by indicating when their experience teaches them that particular instances of scholarly ignorance fall into one of these classes. In A Nation and its Books: A History of the Book in Wales, the editors Jones and Rees are frank about areas in which "much of the basic research has yet to be undertaken." 59 59. Jones and Rees, ed., A Nation and its Books: A History of the Book in Wales, p. xiii. Such admissions manifest responsible scholarship, rather than incompetence. The candid disclosure of what we do not know, and the careful assessment of the reasons for our incomprehension , can help direct future investigations and lead us to more adequate understandings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7. The De Facto Culture of Intellectual Property Scrutinizing the contents of dictionaries, encyclopedias, poetic miscellanies, magazines, and other works teaches us that, for all the careful tracing of legal cases that scholars have done, we still know very little about the de facto culture of "intellectual property" as it has operated in the book trade. 60 60. Paulina Kewes, ed., Plagiarism in Early Modern England (London: Palgrave Macmillan , 2003) provides useful essays on the evolution of ideas about intellectual property and its theft. Among the general works on this topic are: Alexander Lindley, Plagiarism and Originality (New York: Harper, [1952]); Thomas Mallon, Stolen Words: Forays into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism (1989; repr. New York: Penguin Books, 1991); and Neal Bowers, Words for the Taking: The Hunt for a Plagiarist (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1997). Although this regrettable gap in our knowledge obtains not only for the hand-press period in Britain, but also internationally and during later periods as well, eighteenth-century England makes a good case in point. 61 61. Helpful guides to the history of intellectual property in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain are Mark Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright (Cambridge, MA; Harvard Univ. Press, 1993), and John Feather, Publishing, Piracy and Politics: An Historical Study of Copyright in Britain (London: Continuum, 1995). See also Brean S. Hammond, Professional Imaginative Writing in England, 1670-1740 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), pp. 19-46. Biographical dictionaries and other eighteenth-century works of reference typically recycled information and sometimes reprinted large passages from earlier works with little or no alteration— viz., the Biographia Britannica (1747-66) borrowed extensively from the General Dictionary (1734-41), and Robert Shiells' Lives of the Poets (1753) used material from both of these—without any known accusations of plagiarism being made. 62 62. See Isabel Rivers, "Biographical Dictionaries and their Uses from Bayle to Chalmers," in Isabel Rivers, ed., Books and Their Readers in Eighteenth-Century England: New Essays (London: Continuum, 2001), pp. 135-169, which suggests the degree to which new dictionaries were indebted to their predecessors. As Ephraim Chambers stated in the article on "Plagiary" in his Cyclopaedia (1728): Dictionary-Writers, at least such as meddle with Arts and Sciences, seem exempted from the common Laws of Meum and Tuum. . . . Their Works are supposed, in great Measure, Assemblages of other Peoples, and what they take from Others they do it avowedly, and in the open Sun . . . and if they rob, they don't do it any otherwise, than as the Bee does, for the publick Service. Their Occupation is not pillaging, but collecting Contributions. 63 63. Ephraim Chambers, Cyclopaedia: Or, An Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, 2 vols. (London: James and John Knapton, John Darby, Daniel Midwinter, Arthur Bettesworth , John Senex [and 13 others in London], 1728) 2: 820-821. Even Johnson's highly celebrated Prefaces Biographical and Critical to the Works of the English Poets (1779-81) is very free in its use of sources—the great biographer routinely fails to acknowledge evident debts to published works, especially biographical dictionaries and other works of reference. 64 64. See the editor's "Introduction" to and the treatment of "Sources" for each biography in Samuel Johnson, The Lives of the English Poets, ed. Roger Lonsdale, 4 vols. (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2006). Johnson's work was, in turn, plagiarized almost immediately. 65 65. Thomas F. Bonnell, "Patchwork and Piracy: John Bell's `Connected System of Biography' and the Use of Johnson's Prefaces," Studies in Bibliography 48 (1995), 193-228. Just as with reference books, so too are many eighteenth-century verse miscellanies closely related to one or more earlier publications, though the degree to which `new' miscellanies are indebted to antecedent collections has not been generally recognized. Poems by the Most Eminent Ladies of Great Britain and Ireland Re-Published from the Collection of G. Colman and B. Thornton . . . with Considerable Alterations, Additions, and Improvements (1785) provides an illustrative example. Chantel Lavoie has revealed that the anonymous editors of the 1785 text "borrowed heavily [without acknowledgment] from a four-volume collection compiled by James Harrison and titled The Lady's Poetical Magazine, or Beauties of British Poetry, " published in 1781-82. Moreover, "Harrison had, in turn, borrowed [also without acknowledgment] older material from the first edition of Poems by Eminent Ladies (1755) to include in The Lady's Poetical Magazine. " 66 66. Chantel Lavoie, " Poems by Eminent Ladies: A Study of an Eighteenth-Century Anthology," unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Univ. of Toronto, 1999, 279. Lavoie's argument is convincing; in addition to comparing the contents of the collections, she demonstrates that the error of not knowing that Miss Whately and Mrs. Darwall are the same person is common to both the 1781-82 and the 1785 anthologies. Thus, the 178182 collection utilized the 1755 anthology, the 1785 version of which used material from the 1781-82 volumes. It is plausible that the 1785 compilers may have elected to remain anonymous because they owned neither the Colman and Thornton text, nor the works they had arrogated from Harrison. In the second half of the eighteenth century, such cases of unauthorized appropriation appear to be more the rule than the exception. 67 67. For an extended treatment of this topic, see Michael F. Suarez, S.J., "The Production and Consumption of the Eighteenth-Century Poetic Miscellany," in Rivers, ed., Books and Their Readers in Eighteenth-Century England: New Essays, pp. 217-251. The same is true for song books and jest books; even many grammars and other school books, as well as almanacs—all of which potentially constituted a highly lucrative market—were regularly plagiarized. Imaginative works too manifest an attitude toward intertextuality and literary borrowing that suggests we need to think beyond the body of statutes and legal cases regarding copyright if we are to develop a more realistic understanding of how copyright and its attendant notions of intellectual property actually functioned in the period. The famous diatribe against plagiarism in Book 5, Chapter 1 of Tristram Shandy —which turns out to have been plagiarized from Robert Burton, who himself stole passages of his text from others—is merely one of the more memorable instances of such borrrowing. Jonathan Swift, who may have inspired Sterne's clever joke, also mockingly implicated himself as a plagiarist in his Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift when the persona claims about the Dean, "But what he writ was all his own" ( Poems 493, line 318)—a line stolen almost verbatim from Sir John Denham's 1667 poem, On Mr. Abraham Cowley (l. 30). More seriously, Alexander Pope was routinely accused by his rivals and enemies of " plagiary ," 68 68. J. V. Guerinot, Pamphlet Attacks on Alexander Pope: A Descriptive Bibliography (London: Methuen, 1969), pp. 34, 49, 51, 58, 87-88, 99, 105-106, 118-119, 124, 127, 145, 147, 157, 159, 190, 192, 196-197, 245-246, 255-256, 287-288, and 302. often with good cause. 69 69. Roger D. Lund, "From Oblivion to Dulness: Pope and the Poetics of Appropriation ," British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies 14 (1991), 171-189. Most importantly in this vein, there is a tremendous gap in our knowledge about piracy—especially in northern England and Scotland, and so-called "moral piracy" in Ireland. 70 70. One hopes that a book-length study of piracy by Adrian Johns, now in progress, will provide some redress. So much basic research is yet to be done concerning who the pirates were, the extent of their enterprise, the distribution networks they employed (domestic, foreign, and colonial), and the nature of their economic impact. The paucity of our knowledge on these fronts effectively means that there is a significant flaw in our working models of the ways in which the book trade operated in the British Isles, c. 1750-1830. The work of other book historians and the nature of piracy itself suggests that the de facto culture of intellectual property remains an inadequately understood aspect of book history across most periods and in most places. Although I have not investigated the matter in detail, it seems that, for eighteenth-century Britain at least, the gaps in our knowledge come from all three classes of ignorance: a failure to synthesize what is already known, a promising area of research that has not been properly investigated, and, inevitably, lacunae in the surviving historical record, especially with regard to clandestine activities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8. Some Problems Involved in Reading as a Subject of Book History The subject of reading presents a number of significant problems for book historians, perhaps the most obvious among them being controversies over assessing literacy—do signatures in marriage registers really signify functional literacy? 71 71. For a useful survey of relevant studies on literacy in the eighteenth century, see Harvey J. Graff, The Legacies of Literacy (Bloomington: Univ. of Indiana Press, 1987), pp. 230-248, 313-340. David Cressy's Literacy and the Social Order: Reading and Writing in Tudor and Stuart England (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1980) is a fine guide to earlier periods, while W. B. Stevens, Education, Literacy, and Society, 1830-70: The Geography of Diversity in Provincial England (Manchester: Manchester Univ. Press, 1987) serves well for the years following the long eighteenth century. —and the nature of the so-called "reading revolution." 72 72. On the "reading revolution" see Rolf Engelsing, "Die Perioden der Lesergeschichte in der Nauzeit: Das statistische Ausmass und die soziokulturelle Bedeutung der Lektüre," Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens 10 (1969), cols. 944-1002; and Engelsing's Der Bürger als Leser: Lesergeschichte in Deutschland, 1500-1800 (Stuttgart, 1971). Engelsing's work has been questioned by a number of prominent scholars: Robert Darnton, "Readers Respond to Rousseau: The Fabrication of Romantic Sensibility," in his The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History (London: Allen Lane, 1984), pp. 215-256 [pp. 219-251]; Roger Chartier, The Cultural Use of Print in Early Modern France, trans. Lydia G. Cochrane (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1987), pp. 222, 224-225, 231-233; Robert Darnton, "First Steps toward a History of Reading," in his The Kiss of Lamourette, 154-187 [pp. 165-166]; and John Brewer, "Reconstructing the Reader: Prescriptions, Texts and Strategies in Anna Larpent's Reading," in James Raven, Helen Small, and Naomi Tadmor, eds., The Practice and Representation of Reading in England (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 226-245 [pp. 243-244]. Yet, there is a more fundamental and not wholly insurmountable difficulty in studying the history of reading. It may well be impossible to write a representative history of reading based on the experiences of individuals because the overwhelming majority of reading events are ephemeral and those that are recorded are necessarily atypical. How can we develop historically sound approaches to scrutinizing reading practices when most direct evidence of actual reading is merely anecdotal? Alastair Fowler approaches the same problem from a slightly different angle, noting that scholars seeking to establish a history of reading will "soon encounter an insuperable difficulty: the absence of data." Accordingly, a line of historical inquiry that depends on the close examination of an individual's reading practices—what Fowler styles a "minute phenomenology of reading"—ultimately "depends on a nonexistent history of sensibility and psychological events" and, hence, "is not very practical." "In the end," he argues, "the only reader responses we can know in detail are our own." For Fowler, there is no authentic way to "resolve the impasse of historical discontinuity." 73 73. Alastair Fowler, "The Selection of Literary Constructs," New Literary History 7 (1975), 39-55 [p. 45]. Despite the great enthusiasm among book historians for the study of reading , Andrew Hadfield, co-editor of A History of the Irish Book, Volume III, The Irish Book in English 1550-1800 (OUP, 2006), pursues a similar line of thought, writing of "the sort of problems that plague anyone working in the now ubiquitous but rather amorphously defined interdisciplinary subject , the `history of the book.' " Above all, he notes the simple truth that "Evidence left behind by readers is generally scanty, and all too often scholars are left trying to work out what the reader intended when he or she—if an identity is known, let alone a date—underlined a particular passage." 74 74. Andrew Hadfield, "Editor as Censor," review of Kevin Sharpe and Steven N. Zwicker, eds., Reading, Society, and Politics in Early Modern England (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2004), in Times Literary Supplement (20 February 2004), 26. As such observations suggest, the value of collecting records of readers' experiences—often isolated and invariably anomalous—may be rather suspect. 75 75. A recent example of such collecting is Stephen Colclough, Reading Experience 1700-1840: An Annotated Register of Sources for the History of Reading in the British Isles, History of the Book on Demand Series, 6 (Reading: Simon Eliot, 2000). See also the Open University/British Library project, The Reading Experience Database, the aim of which is to collect the historical evidence for reading in the British Isles 1450-1914: &lt;http:// www.open.ac.uk/Arts/RED/&gt;. An elementary knowledge of statistics and of basic sampling theory indicates a further epistemological problem with such projects—when we consider the vast number of unrecorded instances of reading, the number of surviving recorded reading events must perforce be statistically insignificant because the sample size represents far too small a proportion of the whole. It might well be desirable to know what a person read, especially if we can learn the salient facts of that reader's life (age, gender, occupation, education, income, social contacts, etc.), but to know how that person read is almost always historically unrecoverable. Leah Price also evinces concern about how historians think about reading practices and the historical evidence they find. "Familiarity makes reading appear deceptively knowable," she observes. On the one hand, "[t]he most impassioned reading destroys its own traces" because it goes unrecorded, while on the other, "studies drawing on autobiography or marginalia alike are biased toward certain kinds of readers and styles of reading." 76 76. Leah Price, "Reading: The State of the Discipline," Book History 7 (2004), 303-320 [p. 312]. Price's valuable survey provides an excellent introduction to this area of inquiry and to many of the most important studies on reading published in the past 25 years. See also Roger Chartier, "Histoire de la lecture: selection bibliographique," In Octavo (Spring 1993), Supplement. Even potentially more comprehensive projects such as the Reading Experience Database "are inevitably opportunistic in their cherry-picking of decontextualized `reading experienes' from sources whose own structure and content differ widely" with the result that historians of reading may be "like magpies " (313). These difficulties are of genuine consequence and too often have not been sufficiently acknowledged. Thus, we may reasonably ask: given the frequently suspect nature of the evidence and the troublesome ways that book historians have sometimes used it, how might we conduct research in this important area with a greater sense of intellectual responsibility? However formidable the evidential problems we have been considering, the epistemological predicaments presented by the surviving traces of individual readers' experiences do not mean that we should abandon the history of reading as an area of inquiry . No less an accompished historian and historiographer than Carlo Ginzburg has argued for the admissibility of incomplete and even distorted evidence, provided that the interpreters of such information have a thorough understanding of its limitations. "Without a thorough analysis of its distortions (the codes according to which it has been constructed and/or it must be perceived)," he insists, "a sound historical reconstruction is impossible." 77 77. Carlo Ginzburg, "Checking the Evidence: The Judge and the Historian," in Questions of Evidence: Proof, Practice, and Persuasion across the Disciplines, ed. James Chandler, Arnold I. Davidson, and Harry Harootunian (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1994), pp. 290-303 [p. 295]; reprinted from Critical Inquiry 18 (Autumn 1991), 79-92. See also Ginzburg's discussion of distorted evidence, "The Inquisitor as Anthropologist," in his Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, trans. John and Anne C. Tedeschi (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1989), 156-164 [pp. 158-159]; and his complementary essay, "Clues: Roots of an Evidential Paradigm," in the same volume, pp. 96-125. In addition, it would seem profitable to develop a history of constructing and construing meaning not merely from the isolated and evidentially problematic recorded reactions of readers, but also from bibliography and publishing history, from the ways in which material forms—bibliographical codes of many kinds—both effect and affect meanings. The purposive actions of various agents in the book trade are traceable in tens of thousands of books and are typically calculated to influence their benign reception in as strong a manner as possible. Accordingly, we ought to ground our reading and reception studies more thoroughly in physical bibliography, as well as in the analysis of book advertisements, reviews, promotional campaigns, and the like. This is not to say that such studies could be altogether free from problems of historical interpretation, but at least they would rest on sound epistemological foundations. Understanding that the book, every book, is an integrated system of signifiers and that the bibliographical codes embodied in a particular book most often reflect interpretations and decisions about the audience, meaning, and cultural significance of that book, some of the most adept book historians have convincingly delineated the relationships between forms and meanings. Striving to exhibit the complex relationships between texts and readers in the production of meaning, Roger Chartier has demonstrated that "the editorial history of Molièré's comedies has a significant impact on the reconstruction of contemporary understandings of them," and D. F. McKenzie has done much the same for the plays of Congreve. 78 78. Roger Chartier, "Texts, Printing, Readings," in The New Cultural History, ed. Lynn Hunt (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1989), pp. 154-175 [p. 162]; and McKenzie, "Typography and Meaning: The Case of William Congreve." See also Chartier, The Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in Europe Between the Fourteenth and Eighteenth Centuries, trans. Lydia G. Cochrane (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1994 [originally published in French, 1992]), especially pp. vii-xi and 1-23. Both scholars employ a synthetic method, embracing "textual criticism, the history of the book, and cultural sociology" to show how the presentation of the text is calculated to affect its reception. 79 79. Chartier, "Texts, Printing, Readings," p. 175. If the history of reading and reception were more nearly allied to the study of the material book, we might well find that these areas of inquiry are mutually informing. 80 80. Cf. Kevin Sharpe's expression of concern in Reading Revolutions: The Politics of Reading in Early Modern England at the failure of book historians "to incorporate reception theory into a historical and material study of books and their readers" (p. 39). On the study of reception, see Hans Robert Jauss, Toward an Aesthetic of Reception, trans. Timothy Bahti (Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982), especially pp. 3-75. Moreover, the study of how readers make meanings should not be primarily confined to scrutinizing individual reader responses. Rather, in keeping with the need to develop a richer and more complex sociology of texts (see section 4 above), book historians might profitably focus their efforts on reading as a social practice that is conditioned by other socially constituted practices and institutions—just as it, in turn, exercises an influence on them. Recognizing that even the most solitary reader is, inescapably, engaged in a culturally situated pursuit, we may perceive that there is a tremendous scholarly labor to be undertaken in locating reading within the complex forms of social life that condition this activity at any given moment in history. Accordingly , we ought to seek a better understanding of how the practices and institutions of reading and reception are imbedded in and informed by larger cultural and political structures. So situated in the sociology of texts, the study of reading holds a scholarly potential commensurate with its difficulty as an area of investigation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9. Numbers "Follow the money" is an excellent adage for book historians. The production , distribution, and consumption of texts are almost always co-determined by commercial and/or economic factors. Whether we are calculating the area of pastureland needed by a medieval monastery operating a scriptorium in order to maintain a sufficient number of animals for parchment production (surplus to requirements for food to feed hungry scribes), or are factoring in the cost of severance packages when Bertlesmann has acquired a publisher of scientific journals in North America, we cannot think very far about the transmission of texts before we bump into matters of money because, invariably , money matters. Books are business. It seems strange, then, that so few book historians possess economic knowledge, while the rest of us know almost nothing about prices, income, capital, markets and consumer behavior, financing , taxation, money and banking, and other rudiments of elementary macro- and microeconomics. 81 81. One way to begin developing a sufficient understanding of book-trade economics is to gain a deeper sense of the value of money and, hence, of the prices being charged—see John J. McCusker, How Much Is That in Real Money? A Historical Commodity Price Index for Use as a Deflator of Money Values in the Economy of the United States, 2nd ed. (Worcester, MA: American Antiquarian Society, 2001). Historians of the book in Britain will find McCusker's on-line calculator useful for converting an historical sum in pounds, shillings , and pence into today's money: &lt;http://www.eh.net/ehresources/howmuch/poundq. php&gt;. There is also a calculator for converting historical U.S. dollars into current money. And who among our number knows very much about the history of accounting or the evolution of business practices in our respective periods? If commercial motivations dominate the world of print production and dissemination, then how is it that we so often give them such scant attention? 82 82. Of course, there are notable exceptions; see, for example, James Raven, "The Book as a Commodity," in The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 5, 1695-1830, ed. Michael F. Suarez, S.J., and Michael Turner (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007), chap. 3; Raven's forthcoming history of the English book trade, 1450-1900 (2007); and William St Clair, The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2004). Robert Darnton's The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1979) is exemplary in this regard. Perhaps for a start we should all resolve to read G. R. Hawke's Economics for Historians (1980). 83 83. G. R. Hawke, Economics for Historians (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1980). In studying a business in which capital outlay was so substantial, credit was routinely extended to customers for six months or more, return on investment was slow to accrue, and bankruptcy was common, it is particularly important to recognize how changes in financing and credit arrangements fostered or hindered growth. This is especially true if we are to understand how adjustments in capitalization drove the shift from bookselling to publishing in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In a similar vein, we have yet to develop satisfactory accounts of the book trade's behavior in—and varying responses to—the well-documented fluctuations of national economics. 84 84. For a noteworthy exception, see John Bidwell, "American Papermakers and the Panic of 1819," in Barker, ed., A Potencie of Life, pp. 89-112; see also J. J. Barnes, " Depression and Innovation in the British and American Book Trade, 1819-1939," in Carpenter, ed., Books and Society in History, pp. 231-248. A useful guide for an especially significant period is R. C. O. Matthews, "The Trade Cycle in Britain, 1790-1850," in Derek H. Aldcroft and Peter Fearon, eds., British Economic Fluctuations 1790-1939 (London: Macmillan, 1972), pp. 97-139. Although there is a dearth of surviving business and banking records for the book trade in the long eighteenth century, most of what we do have has not yet been subject to a thoroughgoing financial analysis. Nor has much comparative or synthetic work been done either to document the finances of agents in the trade, 85 85. A noteworthy exception is Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, "Playwrights' Remuneration in Eighteenth-Century London," Harvard Library Bulletin n.s. 10 (1999 [Aug. 2001]), 3-90. or to develop more complete models of how businesses actually worked. Most scholars in the humanities, including many book historians, are virtually innumerate, a liability that affects far more than our general inability to deal adequately with economics and with business records. Much book-historical work manifests a statistical innocence that impoverishes otherwise valuable research. If we are to understand scholarly writings that presuppose the reader knows the rudiments of statistics, then we need to progress beyond the definitions of mode, median, and mean. 86 86. Hugh Amory, "A Note on Statistics," in The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World, 504-518, is right to caution, "precision should not be mistaken for accuracy" (p. 515), but it is nevertheless disconcerting that the only treatments of the data presented are simple percentages and moving averages. More dismaying still is the fact that none of the evidence he offers has been statistically tested to gauge its reliability. Most of us are not at home with such basic concepts as frequency distributions, categorical independent variables, or continuous independent variables, much less multiple regression models. Who among us can interpret a chi-square test, something a first-year undergraduate biologist or sociologist would be expected to do? Roderick Floud's An Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Historians should be required reading. 87 87. Roderick Floud, An Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Historians (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1973). Other helpful guides include: R. Darcy and Richard C. Rohrs, A Guide to Quantitative History (Westport, CT, and London: Praeger, 1995); Lauren Haskins and Kirk Jeffrey, Understanding Quantitative History (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991); Konrad H. Jarausch and Kenneth A. Hardy, Quantitative Methods for Historians: A Guide to Research, Data, and Statistics (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1991); and Michael J. Moroney, Facts from Figures, 3rd rev. ed. (1969; rpt. London: Penguin Books, 1990). The more discursively inclined may wish to begin with Pat Hudson, History by Numbers: An Introduction to Quantitative Approaches (London: Edward Arnold, 2000 [New York: co-published in the U.S.A. by Oxford Univ. Press, 2000]). It would also be salutary for more book historians to be familiar with SPSS, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, the most commonly utilized computer program for basic statistical analysis. 88 88. Among the many guides to SPSS are: David M. Shannon and Mark A. Davenport, Using SPSS to Solve Statistical Problems: A Self-Instruction Guide (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill, 2001); Andy P. Field, Discovering Statistics Using SPSS for Windows (Thousand Oaks, CA, and London: SAGE Publications, 2000); and Brian S. Everitt and Sabine Landau, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SPSS (Boca Raton, FL: Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, 2003). More advanced scholars examining large bodies of data, such as the ESTC, would probably benefit from developments in sampling theory, though in such cases close collaboration with a professional statistician is probably required. 89 89. For a straightforward and genuinely useful application of statistics to analytical bibliography, see David Shaw, "A Sampling Theory for Bibliographical Research," Library 5th ser. 27 (1972), 310-319. One of the chief methodological lacunae in Anglo-American bibliography and book history also seems to stem, in part, from our discomfort with numbers. This oversight in need of redress is our failure to interrogate the bibliographical tools at our disposal—most especially the ESTC —so that we know their strengths and limitations. Virtually all book historians routinely employ enumerative bibliographies for their research, but many apparently give little thought to the details of inclusion criteria, to problems raised by varying survival rates, or to economic constraints and other important factors among the circumstances that produced such research resources. 90 90. We may recognize a closely related case in the ways that bibliographers and book historians have routinely used book auction catalogues for provenance information, even though the commercial circumstances of their production most often makes them unreliable sources; see Michael F. Suarez, S.J., "English Book Sale Catalogues as Bibliographical Evidence: Methodological Considerations Illustrated by a Case Study in the Provenance and Distribution of Dodsley's Collection of Poems, 1750-1795," Library 6th ser. 21 (1999), 321360 . A common scientific adage is: "All measurements are wrong, but some are more wrong than others. The key is to know how wrong your measurement is." This notion has its corollary in the idea of "tolerance" in engineering. 91 91. Cf. G. Thomas Tanselle, "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library 5th ser. 23 (1968), 1-12. W. W. Greg has calculated that, of the 11,000 works entered in the Stationers' Register for 1557-71 and 1576-1640, "6,100 are identified as extant, a percentage of almost 55.5." Reasoning that "there does not appear any very strong ground for supposing that entrance or non-entrance affected survival," he nevertheless concedes: "it is possible . . . that in the field of ephemeral publications, where survival is least likely, the proportion of copies entered may have been somewhat lower." 92 92. Greg, "Entrance in the Stationers' Register: Some Statistics," in W. W. Greg, Collected Papers, ed. J. C. Maxwell (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966), pp. 341-348 [pp. 344, 348]. On factors affecting the survival rates of early printed books, see Joseph A. Dane and Rosemary A. Roberts, "The Calculus of Calculus: W. W. Greg and the Mathematics of Everyman Editions," Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000), 117-128 [pp. 124-127]. D. F. McKenzie's work indicates that what the Wing Catalogue (1641-1700) includes "may not be as high as even 60 to 70 percent of the titles and editions actually published." 93 93. D. F. McKenzie, "Bibliography and History: Seventeenth-Century England." The Lyell Lectures, delivered at the University of Oxford May-June 1988. Typescripts circulated privately. Lecture 4, "[Matthew, Mary, and Samuel] Simmons," p. 4. (Although not published together, two individual lectures have appeared separately in print; " Speech-Manuscript-Print " and "Trading Places.") In his examination of survival rates for ABCs, psalters, and primers from the Stationers' stock in sample years from 1660-1700, John Barnard has documented enormous losses: although some 14,000 psalters were printed annually, only four copies are found in Wing. The loss rates for primers is also astonishingly high: for the 1676-77 fiscal year, "84,000 passed through the Treasurer's hands," yet they "are represented in Wing by a single 16mo black-letter copy in the British Library, dated c. 1670." 94 94. Barnard, "The Survival and Loss Rates of Psalms, ABCs, Psalters, and Primers from the Stationers' Stock, 1660-1700," Library 6th ser. 21 (1999), 148-150 [p. 149]. See also John Barnard, "The Stationers' Stock, 1663/4 to 1705/6: Psalms, Psalters, Primers and ABCs," Library 6th ser. 21 (1999), 369-375. My own calculations for British books in the eighteenth century suggest that, for approximately ten percent of the titles and editions published, not a single copy exists. 95 95. See Suarez, "The Quantity and Nature of Printed Matter: A Bibliometric Analysis in The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 5, 1695-1830, ed. Michael F. Suarez, S.J., and Michael Turner (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007), chap. 1. Survival rates are highly variable, depending on format and genre, among other factors. An overall figure of c. 90% of editions having at least one extant copy is an estimate based on comparing titles and editions from eighteenth-century printers' ledgers and book reviews with entries in the ESTC. Less than one percent of eighteenth-century jobbing printing survives, though such ephemeral publications were the overwhelming majority of presswork—both in terms of sheets printed and of items produced—and the financial lifeblood of most firms, especially in the provinces; see Keith Maslen, "Jobbing Printing and the Bibliographer," cited in n. 40 above. Of course, by definition, none of these lost works or editions is represented in the ESTC, a fact that surely should have a significant effect on many of our searches. 96 96. One problem of information retrieval is that the user may easily detect the irrelevance of some of the "hits" that result from a search, but most often has no way of knowing what potentially relevant data is missing. In information science this is "the recall problem," where recall is "the proportion of relevant information that was retrieved." C. N. Ball, "Automated Text Analysis: Cautionary Tales," Literary and Linguistic Computing 9 (1994), 295-302 [p. 295]. See also D. Blair and E. Maron, "An Evaluation of Retrieval Effectiveness for a Full-Text Document Retrieval System," Communications of the ACM 28 (1985), 298299 , who note that users were confident in the system even when less than 50% of relevant information was retrieved (cited in Ball, 295-296). Because loss rates vary widely according to both format and genre, for certain classes of titles and editions the ESTC is far off the mark. A great deal more work will need to be done before we can calibrate the tools we use and, hence, employ them with greater fidelity to the historical phenomena under investigation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10. Producing a Printed History and Considering Its Use and Readership Both the editors and the chapter authors of CHBB5 have felt enormously constrained by the limitations imposed on us in trying to create a single-volume history that satisfactorily chronicles the major developments concerning the book in Britain and its colonies from 1695 to 1830. Chief among these constraints has been space: the topic of virtually every chapter in the volume is deserving of at least one substantial monograph. In a few felicitous intances we already have genuinely impressive book-length studies to which readers may be directed. Invariably, however, the question of comprehensiveness versus depth presents itself. We have tried to address this tension in part by including case studies and providing tables of data about publications and book-trade personnel. Nevertheless, it is impossible to satisfy the competing demands of depth and breadth in a wholly satisfactory fashion. Closely allied to this issue is the question of what a weighty tome in a multi-volume national history of the book is for: is it a work of ready reference or a book to be read at some length? Is its chief purpose to provide information , or to synthesize vast quantities of information into knowledge? Working in concert with our contributors, Michael Turner and I have tried to produce a book that would be both a serviceable work of reference and an engaging text for more extensive reading. Thorough indexing and cross-referencing have been paramount in making the volume easily navigable for the reference-minded reader. Although CHBB5 tells the story of the efflorescence of print culture in Britain during the end of the hand-press period and chronicles the shift from bookselling to publishing (with its attendant technological and financial developments), we have imposed no orthodoxies, nor prescribed any investigative methods; instead, our hope has always been that a variety of emphases and approaches would reflect the diversity of book-historical studies as practiced in our day. Invariably, we have insisted on scholarly rigor and transparency about what remains unknown , believing that these best serve our readership and the enterprise of book history. It seems inevitable that a book historian should ask: what kind of print product is this and for whom is it intended? Here I must admit to an admixture of pride and shame: its pitch is authentically scholarly and its price is genuinely prohibitive, costing c. £110. The first volume of A History of the Book in America is 662 pages and costs $160 USD; volumes three and four of The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain run to 832 and 920 pages respectively and are currently priced at the paltry sum of £95. 97 97. Amory and Hall, eds., A History of the Book in America, Volume 1, The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999); Hellinga and Trapp, eds., The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 3, 1400-1557 (1999); John Barnard and D. F. McKenzie, eds., assisted by Maureen Bell, The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Volume 4, 1557-1695 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002). Paradoxically , then, in Britain and America we have produced national histories of the book that most book historians cannot afford to own. In contrast, consumers pay just $50 AUS for the first volume to appear in A History of the Book in Australia, making the 444-page book well within the reach of both academics and a popular audience. 98 98. Martyn Lyons and John Arnold, eds., A History of the Book in Australia, 1891-1945: A National Culture in a Colonised Market (St. Lucia: Univ. of Queensland Press, 2001). One way of addressing the problems of inclusiveness, access, and price is to produce a web-based national history of the book, which is free to all. Bibliopolis, the electronic national history of the printed book in the Netherlands from 1460 to the present, offers free access to a survey of the history of the printed book in the Netherlands (in 158 parts written by 40 book historians); an image database for the Dutch history of the book ranging from portraits of printers and publishers to examples of Dutch printing, typefaces, printer's devices, and watermarks; digitized full texts of the most important book-historical studies; and links to relevant databases, websites, and electronic catalogues. 99 99. See &lt;http://www.kb.nl/coop/bibliop/bibl-html/missie_en.html&gt;. Managed and maintained by the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague, Bibliopolis solves many of the most pressing problems associated with a printed national history of the book with sufficient success to make one wonder if books are necessarily the best medium for publishing national histories of the book. 100 100. Of course, such a non-commercial project requires a great deal of funding and institutional support. In addition to the Royal Library, Bibliopolis is supported by the universities of Amsterdam, Leiden, Nijmegen, and Utrecht, and the Nederlandse Boekhistorische Vereniging. One advantage of the web-based project is that it can be updated and expanded over time. It seems reasonable to hope that, in addition to its encyclopaedic entries, Bibliopolis will present more detailed and discursive studies as well. Volume 5 of The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain has more than forty contributors from eight nations writing on topics ranging from printed ephemera to antiquarian books. If it is a success, then the whole will be greater than the mere sum of its individual parts. When the fruit of so much scholarly labor is presented in the aggregate, the reader may reasonably expect that new patterns and new understandings will emerge. As one of its co-editors, I hope that it will be a standard work of reference for many years to come. As a scholar, however, I look forward to the day when book history will have developed sufficiently to require an altogether new version. If the contemporary, educated reader does not find vexing questions as well as helpful answers in the pages of CHBB5, and if the discerning book historian is not led to consider some of the historiographical issues mooted here—to wonder how our historical inquiries might be conducted differently and better—then the book will not have fulfilled its promise. Reflecting on the state of Anglo-American book history and on the ways in which our investigations might develop even greater rigor, creative vision, and sophistication, we may feel with a growing sense of distress that there is a great deal of homework each of us needs to do. It may seem daunting that the demands of book history appear to require a basic knowledge of so many disciplines and, ideally, fluency in several. Clearly, no scholar, however talented , could master all the fields that make essential contributions to book-historical studies. Perhaps, then, it is best that we perceive book history, not as a discipline that any one of us can command, but rather as a multidisciplinary practice that is necessarily collaborative. In his seminal essay of 1982, "What Is the History of Books?," Robert Darnton called attention to the new coordination of activities among an international group of "historians, literary scholars, sociologists [and] librarians." 101 101. Darnton, The Kiss of Lamourette, p. 108. The promise of that statement has yet to be fulfilled, but the need for such collaboration—for a catholic, capacious approach to our undertaking, for promoting a more communitarian scholarly sensibility and practice—is surely vital. Book history is an interdisciplinary endeavor that scholars may creatively undertake together. One vital aspect of such a collegial enterprise concerns our roles as educators in the academy. Because the scholar-teacher is perforce always a student as well, we must instruct and learn from each other, especially as book history continues to develop apace. At the same time, we bear a delightful responsibility for educating our students to surpass us. Accordingly, this medley of observations and reflections from a student of book history with much to learn is tendered, not as a counsel of despair, but in the hope that it might help to invigorate the cluster of interdisciplinary practices we call the history of the book.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">by David L. Vander Meulen * * An earlier version of this article was presented on 24 September 2004 at the University of Toronto as the inaugural lecture of the 2004-2005 program of the Toronto Centre for the Book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"AT this late hour of the world's history," writes Virginia Woolf in "How Should One Read a Book?", "books are to be found in almost every room of the house—in the nursery, in the drawing room, in the dining room, in the kitchen." 1 1. Virginia Woolf, "How Should One Read a Book?", Yale Review 16.1 (Oct. 1926), 32-44 (quotation from p. 32). A considerably revised form of Woolf's essay, without this opening sentence, first appeared in her The Common Reader: Second Series (1932). Her observation is itself a contribution to book history, but it also provides a metaphor of the field: today book history is found in almost every room of the academy, leading to what Robert Darnton has called "interdisciplinarity run riot." 2 2. Robert Darnton, "What is the History of Books?", Daedalus 111.3 (Summer 1982), 65-83 (p. 67). The essay has been reprinted frequently, including in the following places: Books and Society in History, ed. Kenneth E. Carpenter (1983), pp. 3-26; Reading in America: Literature and Social History, ed. Cathy N. Davidson (1989); pp. 27-52; Darnton, The Kiss of Lamourette: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775-1800 (1990), pp. 107-135, 358-362; The Book History Reader, ed. David Finkelstein and Alistair McCleery (2002), pp. 9-26. Whether the subject has a core, what that core might be, and whether it is something more specific than all human perception and communication are therefore topics of great interest. The issue is not one of pedantic tidiness. The attractions and benefits of inquiry that floats above all disciplinary boundaries are great, but when particular approaches are lost sight of, their unique powers of intellectual stimulation also disappear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To suggest what the essence of book history might be, I take my cue from the term "book history" itself, where I consider "book" to be a crucial modifier . I propose that one studies book history by studying books. I will flesh out that vision by identifying some writings that exemplify how different scholars have read this raw material. On the one hand I interpret "book" very broadly to include any written or printed text; but although interesting questions arise as this concept is expanded, for present purposes I want to use "book" as a more limiting or defining term, one that refers to the physicality of the objects carrying texts. What I wish to consider, then, is not so much the history of a play called Hamlet as the history of the printed artifacts known as Hamlet, not so much the history of abstract verbal works but the history of the physical embodiments of the texts of those works.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That simultaneous expanding and restricting of the term is similar to what W. W. Greg did when in 1912 he asked, "What is Bibliography?" Indeed, the current debate over the nature of book history is parallel to the one over bibliography that spanned the twentieth century. Greg too wanted to stretch the bounds as far as possible and presented his own vision in the capacious "I have a dream" passage that concludes his essay. But at the same time he recognized the value of boundaries: the field "attends to the preparation of vellum," he said, but it is "indifferent to the breeding of calves." 3 3. W. W. Greg, "What Is Bibliography?", Transactions of the Bibliographical Society 12 (1911-13), 39-53 (quotation from p. 45). Reprinted in his Collected Papers, ed. J. C. Maxwell (Oxford: Clarendon, 1966), 75-88 (p. 80) and in Sir Walter Greg: A Collection of His Writings, ed. Joseph Rosenblum (1998), pp. 85-96 (p. 90).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I That artifacts are at the core of book history and that their study is an expected activity may seem self-evident, but those contentions have also been widely resisted. To set the stage for the discussion that follows, it is useful first to consider some recent reactions to them. These examples are not intended as a general criticism of the scholars involved, all of whom have contributed significantly to our understanding. But they do suggest that a respect for the centrality of artifacts and their study is not always the guiding principle of work on the subject and that these statements from prominent sources may have encouraged other researchers in less favorable directions. Such rejections come from some of the most widely recognized voices in the field of book history itself. Robert Darnton's put-down of those who analyze original artifacts has become well known. In The Business of Enlightenment : A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775-1800 (1979) he writes, "Step into any rare book room and you will find aficionados savoring bindings, epigones contemplating watermarks, érudits preparing editions of Jane Austen; but you will not run across any ordinary, meat-and-potatoes historian attempting to understand the book as a force in history" (p. 2). Cathy N. Davidson illustrates the phenomenon in a different way. In her book Revolution and the Word: The Rise of the Novel in America (1986) she discusses the number of copies of Susanna Rowson's 1791 novel Charlotte [ Temple ] that were printed (p. 17), and she appends a note that begins, "Few early American publishers kept press figures and even fewer press records survive to the present" (p. 269, n. 9). For what she calls an "excellent discussion" of "the problem" of this lack of extant publishers ' records she refers the reader to two essays by G. Thomas Tanselle. But that reference reveals an incomplete understanding of artifacts in several ways. First, neither article talks about publishers' records, not even to lament their absence, as more direct familiarity with the Tansellean artifacts presumably would have revealed. One of the items, Tanselle's essay "Press Figures in America: Some Preliminary Observations" (from Studies in Bibliography 19 [1966]) is interesting in another regard as well. Davidson seems to interpret the "press figures" of its title as referring to the sales figures of a publisher instead of to the arabic numerals or other symbols inserted at the bottoms of pages to designate responsibility for printing particular formes of the sheets. In so doing she not only suggests a lack of understanding about the physical features of the books she is discussing but also misses completely the point of the article she praises: that the physical books themselves can reveal things about the people who produced them. A couple of publications in 2002 designed specifically for classes in book history also show the tendency to ignore the physicality of books. In The Book History Reader, with its proprietary and pre-emptive definite article, the Editors' Introduction by David Finkelstein and Alistair McCleery begins by saying that "Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the study of the nature of books in Anglo-American circles was dominated by a preoccupation with the physical materiality of books." Without elaborating what that might actually mean, it immediately reassures its readers that the threat posed by such study has greatly diminished: "this tradition of scholarly endeavour" is "still utilized today to a certain extent in courses on bibliographic methods," but "Book history studies has since evolved . . ." (p. 7). Also that year the University of Massachusetts Press, the American Antiquarian Society, and The Center for the Book at the Library of Congress co-published a "book history" anthology (edited by Scott E. Casper, Joanne D. Chaison, and Jeffrey D. Groves) that included the word artifacts in its title: Perspectives on American Book History: Artifacts and Commentary . One approaches the book with curiosity about how it will manage to incorporate physical objects, and in fact it does not. Artifacts here refers not to the objects themselves, or even to the texts of the particular objects under consideration, but rather to quotations from writings about those objects and texts. This emphasis on something other than the actual books is subtle but persistent: the Preface has things backwards, for instance, when it says, "Engaging book history in the classroom demands close attention to the products of print culture: books, magazines, newspapers, advertisements , and so on" (p. vii). A culture characterized as "print" arises from, can only arise from, the existence of printed materials; it is not that some great cultural shift to print culture occurred and then printed objects started to appear. The reluctance to consider printed objects as foundational also pervades the opening essay by Robert A. Gross, entitled "Texts for the Times: An Introduction to Book History," where in the first paragraph he identifies the field under investigation not as books themselves but rather as "the study of communication through writing and print" (p. 1). His account of the pre-history of that field invokes caricatures of earlier workers, among whom he includes "bibliographers, collectors, printers, and publishers": "We hope," he says, quoting Febvre and Martin, "to establish how and why the printed book was something more than the triumph of technical ingenuity " (p. 2). Scholars not consciously pursuing "book history," but whose interests overlap with those who do, have likewise been reluctant to grant respect to printed artifacts. The great collector James M. Osborn sought items of " evidential value," a phrase that a biographer of his says "runs like a leit-motif through . . . [his] conversations about books and manuscripts." 4 4. Laurence Witten, "Contemporary Collectors XXIII: James Marshall Osborn," Book Collector 8 (1959), 383-396 (p. 393). According to Osborn, "only unique copies or books with annotations can be considered to offer the kind of evidential value possessed by manuscripts," and he distinguished the "kinds of printed books appropriate in a collection of evidence ." 5 5. Osborn, "Neo-Philobiblon," Library Chronicle of the University of Texas n.s. 5 (Sept. 1972), 14-29 (pp. 21, 23). Reprinted as Neo-Philobiblon: Ruminations on Manuscript Collecting (1973), in which the quotations are on pp. 15 and 19. Given the influence that a collector of his stature wielded, it is especially regrettable that he did not recognize that all printed books can supply the evidence he so valued, provided one knows how to read them. I happen to have benefited personally from that shortcoming of his, for features of a discarded copy of Pope's Dunciad that I obtained from a dealer distributing Osborn's unwanted books proved the key to unraveling a mystery about Pope's revisions in The Dunciad Variorum of 1729. 6 6. Vander Meulen, "Pope's Revisions during Printing: A Variant Section in The Dunciad, " Modern Philology 78 (1981), 393-398. While acknowledging a collector's prerogative to focus on an area of interest, one can nonetheless think that the world's collective understanding would have been greater had Osborn viewed books differently and recognized the value of keeping this book and others in his own collection. In a call for papers for a special number of PMLA entitled "The History of the Book and the Idea of Literature" (to be published in January 2006) the framers of the invitation encourage potential contributors to develop articles that reflect our new understanding that "print" is above all "a form of social behavior located in encounters with the published word that define both a public life and a private subjectivity." 7 7. " PMLA Special Topic: The History of the Book and the Idea of Literature," MLA Newsletter 35.3 (Fall 2003), 13. Whatever that might mean, it is seen as superseding "an earlier study of books as mere repositories of canonical texts, or as aesthetic objects, or as `evidence' for positivist bibliographic scholarship." The genre of the call for papers exempts it from some other MLA requirements—such as documentation, which might, for instance, identify those past scholars who supposedly argued that books are "mere repositories of canonical texts." The solicitation slips in what has become a cliché in such discussions, that bibliographical scholarship is "positivist"—a term never explained, but conveniently never needing to be, for we all supposedly know that "positivist" means something negative. If contributors heed the guidance of the call for papers, the special number of the journal is unlikely to devote much attention to the physicality of books. In 2001 the Council on Library and Information Resources, or CLIR, issued a report entitled The Evidence in Hand: Report of the Task Force on the Artifact in Library Collections. 8 8. It is available as a printed book and, on the Web, through &lt;http://www.clir.org/ pubs/abstract/pub103abst.html&gt;. The final version followed a draft that was publicly circulated and the subject of hearings at half a dozen or so major research institutions. According to the organizers, it was only at the last stop, the University of Virginia, that questions arose about the core concept of the report, the definition of the title word artifact. As a result of that interchange, some of the most outlandish portions were cut—for instance the contention that "the text [of a printed book] does not vary among copies"; that there is only "one fixed text" of a work, which "Readers may find . . . in hard cover or soft cover; Russian, Spanish, English, or many other languages; edited or unabridged;" that "there is only one `true text' " of War and Peace; and consequently—and this is the point that the statements seemed created to support—that not all forms of the text need to be saved (p. 13). 9 9. The draft report appeared on CLIR's Web site at &lt;http://www.clir.org/activities/ details/artifact-docs.html&gt; but is no longer available. If the removal of this document (ironically, by a group concerned with finding ways to save texts of any kind) occurred because this form of the report was deemed no longer useful, the situation is a reminder of the difficulty of predicting scholarly interests and needs. It also shows the vulnerability of a medium that the report itself advocates as a way of "preserving" printed texts. But the audience was unable to persuade this task force representing more than two hundred academic libraries in the United States and Canada that all printed items—or even the beverage can on the table in the meeting room—are artifacts. As a result, the final report speaks of factors that promote some printed materials to "artifact status" (as, for instance, on p. 23). The practical implications are great. When libraries reproduce printed items in another medium, originals that are of "rare and of artifactual value" should be retained, but "Items that are common, such as journals, and that have content value but little artifactual value" need not be. One suggestion of the report is that everything printed before 1801 has artifactual value and should be saved, but after that date only some printed objects have such value and thus can be retained selectively. The problem with the arbitrariness represented by that date (which seems based simply on the distance of two centuries, a boundary that is always moving) is compounded by an unwarranted confidence in the ability to identify (irrevocably, because items discarded usually cannot be retrieved) the needs of future generations. Among other criteria the report identifies as "best practice" (p. 10) for determining what books are saved is their "evidential value" (perhaps the legacy of Osborn's approach), including whether the object "demonstrate[s] . . . the printing history of the item" (p. 94). As a physical object there is no way that a book can not bear witness to its own history, yet one of the most influential bodies in the library community has lent its support to the view that this is not necessarily the case. A teacher of my acquaintance often begins a course by ripping apart a book in front of his shocked students, aiming to challenge any sentimental notions they might harbor about books. Unlike the authors of the CLIR report, he doesn't deny that the object of his destruction is inherently an artifact. But despite the effectiveness of this dramatic pedagogical demonstration for the point he wishes to make, the gesture encourages an attitude similar to that of the CLIR recommendations and preempts the chance to instill an even more important lesson from the classroom prop: how much it is that any book, even one not deemed worthy of retention, can reveal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II How then might one think productively about artifacts and hence about book history? I would like to consider ten sets of readings that can help, and in so doing to outline what could in effect be the contents of a book history reader. For the readings I propose, I have not tried to work out a representative distribution across time, national literatures, or other demographic categories. Rather, I have attempted to offer different ways of thinking about the same subject, hoping that readers might interchange the examples with ones that come to their own minds. The aspects of my selections that I am emphasizing are suggested by the headings; but each selection accomplishes more, as I try to show, and indeed they all overlap to some extent. I hope that this point too will prove instructive, for part of my theme is that the elements of the field are interconnected. 1. Surveying what exists Katherine F. Pantzer, "The Serpentine Progress of the STC Revision ," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 62:3 (1968), 297-311. Also the STC 10 10. A. W. Pollard and G. R. Redgrave, A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475-1640, 2nd ed., rev. W. A. Jackson, F. S. Ferguson, and Katherine F. Pantzer, 3 vols. (1976-91). entries for the items cited here and relevant excerpts from the STC indexes to printers and publishers and to London addresses. One of the oldest aspirations of human minds has been to accumulate knowledge, a goal at some points concomitant with attempts to identify all the books that exist. Titles such as Konrad Gesner's Bibliotheca universalis in 1545 may better represent goals than accomplishments, but the impulse they reflect is manifested in grand ways in the production of various short-title catalogues and national or international bibliographies. "All good book history—including the most speculative and theoretical—begins with sound bibliography," says Cathy Davidson, having such works in mind. 11 11. "Toward a History of Books and Readers," Reading in America, pp. 1-26 (p. 7). A student of the history of the book might reasonably be expected to recognize the foundational purposes and accomplishments of great projects like these that enable one not only to see all the books of a given time or place together but also to trace given books across time and space. For insight into such catalogues, I propose Katherine Pantzer's article "The Serpentine Progress of the STC Revision." By discussing some complexities of everyday office life, Pantzer reveals the kinds of issues that the authors of the STC had to grapple with, what the work contains, and how it can be used. Her discussion of the search for the people behind the creation of other books has the happy effect of showing the people behind the creation of this one. Primary among their characteristics is a simultaneous interest in books and people: to name dedicatees in books and to identify specific copies when these vary (p. 300); "to track down printers where their names do not appear" and to assign "particular sections of the text when two or more printers were involved" (p. 299); or to state bibliographical format with precision. "I think it interesting to see what information this kind of format description reveals," she says, pointing out that specific features of a quarto or octavo format can show things about the time or place of a book's origin, its genre, and even political circumstances in which it was born: "Some of the Marprelate and John Penry tracts of the late 1580s are probably in . . . [the format they are] because amount of type and size of press were limited by the necessity of traveling light to keep ahead of the authorities" (p. 298). As a case study she offers her investigation of an unrecorded prose broadside. Important elements of her method are to compare the item with other forms of the same work; to consider it in the light of other works whose printed forms have some of the same printer's ornaments, but in different stages of deterioration; and to draw upon findings published by widely scattered scholars who had not known the full implications of "piling up unrelated data" (as their detractors might have said) but who as Pantzer recognizes had placed their discoveries in the collective memory of the world of printed material. She summarizes the outcome of her labyrinthine research in a single word: "Confusion!" (p. 307). But in her modesty and honesty she then provides a further model of how to think about these things. Although she goes on to say, "I was not then and am not now able to make any satisfying sense out of these demonstrable movements of initials, cuts, and factotums," she goes on to make an important contribution. Through the analysis of the physical evidence of the printed objects themselves , she has demonstrated the exact whereabouts of these typographical units at various times, thereby disclosing hitherto unrecognized connections among objects four centuries ago. Moreover, she does have a theory about what this all adds up to, namely, "an aspiring journeyman printer who was buying worn-out stock to have something for starting out in business by himself and who worked both for Mrs. Allde and for the Eliot's Court Press" (p. 307). But, again admirably, she clearly distinguishes this speculation from what she has been able to establish, and she welcomes work by other scholars on the problem she has uncovered. (And, in a footnote added to this passage in proof, she succeeds in identifying the person that her research predicted.) In showing how a great work like the STC is created, Pantzer automatically points to what a work like this is. In a book history reader, her essay might be complemented by the actual entries for the two dozen or so items she cites here, as well as by relevant excerpts from the indexes to printers and publishers and to their addresses, where one can see that the book producers have not only names but also local habitations—ones, moreover , that are in proximity to others. Further natural extensions could be to works such as Peter Blayney's The Bookshops in Paul's Cross Churchyard (1990) or to the online English Short Title Catalogue, with its remarkable capacity for enhancing serendipity through electronic searching. On a still broader plane, one could invoke Tanselle's essay "Some Statistics on American Printing, 1764-1783" 12 12. In The Press and the American Revolution, ed. Bernard Bailyn and John B. Hench (1980), pp. 315-363. as a model of how existing bibliographical reference tools like the STC (or, in this case, Charles Evans's American Bibliography [1903-34, 1955-59]) can be used for imaginative purposes beyond the designs of their creators. 2. Describing, and learning from, physical details Michael Sadleir, Trollope: A Bibliography. London: Constable, 1928. Especially "Preface" (pp. ix-xvi); "Part One. Bibliography: Rachel Ray " (pp. 51-53); "Part Two. Publishing History, Comparative Rarity and Indications of Value of Trollope First Editions : Rachel Ray " (pp. 277-279). Even though the creators of short-title catalogues report only selected details of the books they identify, the range of their investigation often approaches that of descriptive bibliographers, who aim to give a full account of the forms in which a work has appeared. My second proposal is for excerpts from a descriptive bibliography, specifically Michael Sadleir's 1928 volume on Anthony Trollope. Although Sadleir had collectors very much on his mind as he prepared this book, his vision was much wider. It indeed presages the views that inform Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description two decades later and for which Bowers was criticized by those who thought such accounts should serve only the single purposes that were of special interest to themselves. 13 13. I summarize the responses to Bowers in "The History and Future of Bowers's Principles," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 79 (1985), 197-219. The opening words of Sadleir's bibliography challenge those who look to such research as merely a guide to bibliographical points: "At the very outset of this book," he writes in his Preface, I wish to emphasize the general as opposed to the particular element in its potential usefulness. Bibliography can be extended beyond a mere descriptive analysis of the works of any one writer or period; it can be made to illustrate, not only the evolution of book-building, but also the history of book-handling and the effect of a gradually perfected book-craft on the aims and achievements of authorship. Consequently, if I claim for this bibliography of Anthony Trollope that it is not only a reference work for collectors of that particular author but also a commentary on the book and publishing crafts of mid-Victorian England, I am claiming no extreme of attainment for my own book, but rather that it seeks to exploit the several possibilities of its theme and relates its individual subject to the general conditions of his time. (p. ix) Besides looking at an expansion of these points in the rest of Sadleir's Preface, one might turn to a representative entry in Part One, say that for Rachel Ray, and then the parallel section in Part Two, where he considers in further detail the implications of what he has reported in the first section, partly by combining those particulars with information gleaned from sources beyond the books themselves. For Rachel Ray, he offers an explanation for the scarcity of "first edition" copies by interrelating the number of copies stipulated in the publishing contract, the binding variants he has identified, the similarities on the title pages of different so-called "editions," the condition of surviving copies of the latest printing, various features of advertisements , and a short-lived burst of intense competition in 1863 among publishers of novels. The category of descriptive bibliography is a good instance of the potential for interchangeability that I have mentioned. I recommend Sadleir in part because the date of the views he advocates is significantly earlier than some people believe such approaches to have existed. But the principles themselves might be readily shown in other scholarship, as in Patricia Lockhart Fleming and Sandra Alston's Early Canadian Printing (1999), their supplement to Marie Tremaine's A Bibliography of Canadian Imprints, 1751-1800 (1952). In their Introduction they point out that Book historians who use the records in Appendix A to analyze what was actually printed together with the evidence of imprints that have survived and are entered in Tremaine and Early Canadian Printing will begin to chart the economics of the trade and follow the daily rhythm of work in an eighteenth-century print shop. Students of reading will speculate about literacy and posting bills or consider the role of printed forms in everyday life. And, although the accounts of this family of early printers are unique in Canada, a small collection of vouchers transcribed in Appendix B extends the documentation of business practice to other Quebec shops, to Fleury Mesplet in Montreal, and to printers working in the new province of Upper Canada. (p. xix) A series of indexes then guides readers in various systematic ways to part of what has been established in the descriptions themselves, thereby also providing hints of still further ways of mining the bibliography. 3. Using external records D. F. McKenzie, The Cambridge University Press, 1696-1712: A Bibliographical Study. 2 vols. Cambridge: University Press, 1966. Chapter 5: "Organization and Production" (1: 94-146); bibliographical descriptions of editions of Thomas Bennet's An Answer to the Dissenters Pleas for Separation (entries 11, 19, 44, 164); press records for Bennet publications. As the third example, one might profitably study what is almost certainly D. F. McKenzie's greatest scholarly achievement, his account of the Cambridge University Press from 1696 through 1712. This two-volume work consists of three parts: a monograph-length introduction about the history, organization, and policy of the press, a descriptive bibliography of items printed there, and a transcription of press records (which are notable among other reasons for their identification of actual employees). Any one of these sections would be a major contribution by itself, and their combination gives the study unparalleled strength as McKenzie uses the records and his direct scrutiny of the artifacts they describe to provide a narrative of the production of books. The study's third chapter, "Organization and Production," is typical of McKenzie's success in reconciling and giving narrative shape to his two main sources of information, the books themselves and the records about them. In this particular essay he explores how the press worked: who governed it, who superintended the work flow, and who actually performed the physical labor. One of the great values of the extensive records transcribed here is the detail they provide about aspects of production that are otherwise unrecoverable, such as the names, stints, and pay dates of compositors, pressmen, and correctors, the terms of payment by the customer, the number of copies printed, and the (frequently irregular) movement of a project through the press. The accounts of the four editions of Thomas Bennet's An Answer to the Dissenters Pleas for Separation that the press printed from 1699 to 1707 illustrate many such features. With regard to edition size, for example, the Minute Book records that on 7 June 1699 the Curators agreed to print up to seven hundred and fifty copies of the first edition for the customer, the bookseller Alexander Bosvile, but when the book sold well they soon agreed (at their meeting of 20 December that year) to print a second edition of one thousand. In 1701 they raised the print run of a third edition to two thousand, and then eventually printed the book one more time six years later, in a final edition of twelve hundred and fifty. Bosvile's payment terms are likewise specified in the Minute Book, while the Vouchers itemize the charges for individual sheets as they were produced. McKenzie's essay also draws on his examination of the books themselves, many details of which are recorded in the bibliographical descriptions. Only by looking at the actual objects is he able to offer generalizations about daily facts of the worker's lives, such as which side of each sheet they tended to print first, or how they reused skeleton formes. Only by checking the books can he identify a leaf whose replacement is not noted in the records (leaf A2 in the first edition), and only from them can he glean data about the type fonts used and about the size of the printed pages. But McKenzie also shows that the scholar's task is more than to piece together the insights from different sources, for the sources themselves require interpretation. Sometimes the challenge is simply to organize the data into generalizations, as he does when he compares the title-page dates on books with the dates of the completion of printing as reported in the records (1:145). But the evidence of each source also needs evaluation, and when the findings do not mesh they require reconciliation. Though the printing records would seem to be a "primary" source, with respect to the books they are secondary, for they are reports of events represented by the books themselves . Thus, when for the first edition the compositor Bertram twice claims having set gathering U, McKenzie points out that "the first of these claims was presumably in error for T"—implicitly because the book itself has only one gathering U but also a gathering T, and no compositor has claimed T. Likewise for the printers of the second edition: "Cotton and Ponder claimed twice for K, but the later of these claims is almost certainly in error for R." (All statements should be assessed, of course, even if there is nothing apparently wrong with them.) Meanwhile, interpreting the books is in turn helped by the records, which can draw attention to features that might otherwise be overlooked. Vouchers for the first edition record composition and printing of a half sheet for gathering L, but, says McKenzie, "I cannot be sure from the one copy seen which leaves were cancelled." Without the records, this alteration might have passed unnoticed—though it is also possible that L was not changed at all in the particular copy that McKenzie checked. Even in the report of his own uncertainty McKenzie serves as a model: he is straightforward about what he has found (or been unable to find), and he signals the ultimate importance of examining multiple copies, even if circumstances limited him to a single one. 4. Thinking clearly about bibliographical evidence Paul Needham, "Johann Gutenberg and the Catholicon Press," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 76 (1982), 395456 . Paul Needham's "Johann Gutenberg and the Catholicon Press" is important for its insight into the earliest era of European printing, but it has even broader significance as a model of how to employ evidence. Needham sought to figure out the production history of a group of items long considered , on the evidence of their type, to have emanated from the same printer: the lengthy Catholicon of Johannes Balbus, which exists in three separate printings and was produced (according to its colophon) in Mainz, Germany, in 1460, and two short works, each of which is found in two printings. The question has been the subject of long debate, and it has attracted special interest because of the possibility that the unnamed printer was Gutenberg himself. Needham's article has generated more than a dozen major responses and counter-responses, with his own contributions appearing in journals from four countries (thereby incidentally reflecting the widespread locations of the evidence). 14 14. Among the articles generated by Needham's initial one are the following: Walter J. Partridge, "The Type-Setting and Printing of the Mainz Catholicon," Book Collector 35 (1986), 21-52; Needham, "The Type-Setting of the Mainz Catholicon: A Reply to W. J. Partridge," Book Collector 35 (1986), 293-304; two articles in a number of the Wolfenbütteler Notizen zur Buchgeschichte (13.2 [1988]) devoted to studies of Catholicon research presented at a conference in December 1985: Martin Boghardt, "Die bibliographische Erforschung der ersten `Catholicon'-Ausgabe(n)," 138-176, and Needham, "The Catholicon Press of Johann Gutenberg: A Hidden Chapter in the Invention of Printing," 199-230; Richard Schwab, "Some Signs of Stereotyping of the Yale Vellum Copy of the Mainz Catholicon," Yale University Library Gazette 63 (1988), 8-13; Lotte Hellinga, " Analytical Bibliography and the Study of Early Printed Books with a Case-Study of the Mainz Catholicon," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 64 (1989), 47-96; Needham, "Corrective Notes on the Date of the Catholicon Press," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 65 (1990), 46-64; Hellinga, "Comments on Paul Needham's Notes," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 65 (1990), 65-69; Needham, "Further Corrective Notes on the Date of the Catholicon Press," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 66 (1991), 101-126; Hellinga, "Proof for the Date of Printing of the Mainz Catholicon," Bulletin du bibliophile, 1991, 1: 143-147; Hellinga, "Slipped Lines and Fallen Type in the Mainz Catholicon," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 67 (1992), 35-40; Hellinga, "Eltville and Mainz: A Tale of Two Compositors," Book Collector 41 (1992), 28-54; Needham, "Mainz and Eltville: The True Tale of Three Compositors," Bulletin du bibliophile, 1992, 2: 257-304; and Needham, "Slipped Lines in the Mainz Catholicon: A Second Opinion," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 68 (1993), 25-29. His subsequent pieces elaborate on some of his discoveries, and their interplay with the questioning of his challengers provides numerous case studies of contrasting ways of handling evidence. All the essential features of his method are nonetheless available in the initial piece. Fundamental to interpretation is the gathering of evidence. Needham values the great amount of scholarship that has accumulated, but he also recognizes the need to verify its findings. (Some criticisms of his argument prompt him to point out [as in his "Further Corrective Notes," p. 115, and "Slipped Lines," p. 27] that such testing includes going to actual books instead of relying on photographs, which, as he shows, can misrepresent the evidence.) Guided by his predecessors, he first of all refines their reports of paper stocks—and ultimately their interpretations: "three paper historians , all eminent practitioners of their science, have studied the Catholicon question, and have arrived at three mutually contradictory conclusions. As it happens, all three are wrong" (p. 421). His approach also is to seek the widest relevant contexts. That method is not original in considerations of this material—the earlier inference of the "Catholicon printer" from a number of disparate publications is based on the same principle—but he expands it: The recent investigations of the Catholicon press have ended in confusion because they have been restricted, quite arbitrarily, to only a limited sector of the available evidence, namely that of the paper stocks. A wider view is necessary to attain an understanding of how the Catholicon press books were produced. (p. 423) He then enumerates sixteen important "facts relevant to understanding the workings of this press." These particular points in turn rest on bibliographical investigations interconnecting a host of contextual physical features in addition to paper: among them, accidents of type-setting, progressive type damage, type printed upside down, reset lines, shifting type over multiple copies, blind impressions of bearer types, cancel leaves, pinholes, waste sheets used for binding, and early purchase inscriptions. The article thus also serves as a primer of bibliographical techniques, but its effectiveness as a model of reasoning does not depend on bibliographical knowledge as such. Part of that success comes from Needham's stress on logical method, particularly on levels of evidence. The adjectives in his phrase "This is possible, but not probable" (p. 422) become a litany throughout the subsequent debate. Again, he is not original in making the distinction they entail, for it is one that has been emphasized by clear thinkers in all fields. (In bibliography, it is most famously developed by Fredson Bowers in his 1959 Lyell Lectures, published in 1964 as Bibliography and Textual Criticism : Bowers structures his discussion on the categories of the possible, the probable, and the demonstrable.) But Needham makes especially vivid use of the principle as he considers arguments—his own and others'—that have been put forth about these books. Though insight comes by imagining possibilities , to conceive of a scenario is not enough; as he says in a later article, "an indefinitely large number of occurrences are `perfectly possible' without being likely in the least" ("Corrective Notes," p. 50). Nor is it adequate to establish the likelihood that within a given era certain events might have occurred; one needs to show the probability that they happened in a particular instance, and that such an interpretation is more likely than competing ones. To this central point Needham offers various corollaries: that assertion, even repeated assertion, is not proof; that prejudged observations are dangerous; and that one's premises and presuppositions need constant examination. The most striking aspect of the article is the startling conclusion to which Needham's methods lead him. The facts he has identified "appear to me," he says, "to say the following: The Catholicon printer's three books were not printed with movable types. The type pages of these books were composed of indissoluble two-line slugs, arranged into columns or pages as the case may be. After printing, the slugs were retained, and at later times additional impressions were pulled from them" (p. 425). As with most details of early printing, no contemporary attestation of such a procedure is known, and Needham's argument rests strictly on features of objects that were present in the fifteenth century—the books themselves, which bear evidence of their creation. It is how to interpret this evidence that has proven contentious. Scholars have come to general agreement with his observation that the type of these books does occur in two-line units, but the physical mechanism of that pairing has continued to provoke debate. As Needham himself points out, his conclusions bear little relation to the familiar picture of how fifteenth-century shops operated, but they best take into account what has been discovered from the books themselves, and they avoid the objections attendant on other explanations. Eager to confirm for himself what actually happened, over the course of the articles he proposes tests that could refute his explanation. But as he meets the challenges to his proposals, it appears that careful attention to the actual books not only has solved an old puzzle but also has revealed a printing house practice that no one had suspected. All these discoveries in turn lead to resolution of a lingering and important question that Needham discusses in a coda: "I find it impossible to imagine that the Mainz resident who by 1460 was capable of posing and solving this problem ["of permanently fixing typographical compositions"] could have been other than Johann Gutenberg" (p. 432). 5. Defining the field G. Thomas Tanselle, The History of Books as a Field of Study. Chapel Hill: Hanes Foundation, 1981. Also published as "From Bibliography to Histoire Totale, " Times Literary Supplement, 5 June 1981, 647-649. Reprinted in his Literature and Artifacts (Charlottesville: Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1998), pp. 41-55 (the source of the quotations below). All of the examples considered thus far might be viewed as instances of an approach primarily concerned with the analysis of a book's physical features, yet each of them also emphasizes aspects of the human side of book production and the role of books in society. That this mixture is no fluke but rather inherent in thoughtful considerations of book history is the theme of an article in which G. Thomas Tanselle contemplates the field, his 1981 essay The History of Books as a Field of Study. "Linking l'histoire du livre and English analytical and historical bibliography," says Tanselle, "is not a pulling together of separate disciplines; rather, by the very nature of their subject each is inherently a part of the other, and any separation of them is artificial and lessens the validity of their conclusions. . . . All scholars of the history of books . . . are historians," and "since books are physical objects, any study of the history of books, even when it focuses on the ideas disseminated through them, cannot ignore the physical aspects of books and the effects they have had on the works being transmitted" (p. 46). To illustrate what this unified field theory means in practice, Tanselle turns to textual study. Serious readers of texts on any subject need "to have available any textual evidence that may have a bearing on understanding the meaning of the text," and bibliographical analysis is an important way of establishing that evidence. By the same token, if one is interested in discussing "the influence of a work in a particular area and period," perhaps on the basis that it appears in an early catalogue listing, one needs to know "the peculiarities of the texts in which that work was being read" (p. 49). "If book history is to be concerned—as it rightly should be—," he says, "with the role of books in spreading ideas, then textual matters are central to it; and the analysis of the physical evidence found in books is, in turn, central to the elucidation of textual questions. Textual study, in other words, provides a direct and inevitable link between analytical bibliography and l'histoire du livre " (p. 50). Scholars of social and economic history, which also involve the role of books in the world, often draw mainly from surviving business records. But here too, the only full explanations can come by considering the objects that are the subjects of that history. Collectors, both institutional and private, are thus especially important for the study of book history, for they are "preserver[s] of the evidence [that is, the artifacts themselves] upon which all book history must rest" (p. 53). 6. Interpreting variant physical features David L. Vander Meulen, "The Printing of Pope's Dunciad, 1728," Studies in Bibliography 35 (1982), 271-285. From one of my own articles I offer an instance of how the particulars of a text can affect the impact and understanding of a book in society and how those elements themselves are affected by factors that bibliographical analysis can reveal. The example comes from a piece called "The Printing of Pope's Dunciad, 1728." The question at issue was, Which Dunciad came first? The circumstances were similar to those of another eighteenth-century work, Rousseau's Émile, thirty-four years later: its earliest publications, with false imprints, were an octavo and a duodecimo, printed from the same setting of type but with precedence uncertain. 15 15. Jo-Ann E. McEachern necessarily addresses the question about Émile in her Bibliography of the Writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau to 1800, vol. 2: Emile, ou de l'éducation (1999). She concludes her useful summary of the history of the long debate with the observation, "Evidently, the question of the order of the printing has not yet been resolved to everyone's satisfaction" (p. 9)—and then goes on to establish that "The sheets of the duodecimo text were printed first" (p. 17). The Dunciad problem commanded widespread attention from the early 1850s, when W. J. Thoms, editor of Notes and Queries, asked readers to send him their copies of the numerous early editions so that he could untangle the poem's history. His account was soon challenged, but it stood until R. H. Griffith published the first part of his Pope bibliography in 1922. Meanwhile T. J. Wise had been preparing the Pope section of the catalogue of his own collection, The Ashley Library, and the following year he contested Griffith's ordering of the Dunciads. Griffith responded in the second part of his bibliography in 1927, and in this nasty scholarly brawl Wise countered in his catalogue A Pope Library (1931). Wise then died, conveniently allowing Griffith the last word—at least until David Foxon revived the question in a 1958 TLS article and in his catalogue English Verse 1701-1750 (1975). This scholarly wrangling was one impact the forms of the text had on society, as was the vast differential in prices that the two early forms commanded at auction. But most germane to present purposes is the influence the texts had on perceptions of Pope. Much of the debate over priority had centered on a handful of textual variations between the two formats. The most prominent discrepancy involved the opening word: was the preferred reading "Book" or "Books"? The plural form might be expected, for the line "Books and the man I sing" would then parallel the beginning of the Aeneid. Thoms, however, had decided that the singular "Book" came first and that it was Pope's intended form. That reading provided a basis for the controversial but widespread nineteenth-century view that Pope's writing was motivated by petty personal animosities and that The Dunciad was not a general satire on dulness but rather a particularized attack on one person. The 1916 Grolier Club Catalogue of an Exhibition Illustrative of the Text of Shakespeare's Plays shows that such an impact was not simply a possibility but an actuality: amid the editions of Shakespeare it includes what it specifies as the "First edition, first issue" of The Dunciad, with the reading "Book," calling this "Pope's revenge for the Shakespeare Restored of [Lewis] Theobald," which had attacked Pope. By the time I started to work on the question, scholars had offered plausible but conflicting explanations about the direction of the variants. Literary analysis by itself could go no further. By analyzing physical features of the copies I was able to determine that the printing of the duo-decimo and octavo had been unorthodox, with the first half of the poem printed first as a duodecimo and then as an octavo, and then the second half done the same way. The plural "Books" was the original reading, with the "s" falling out as the type was reimposed for the octavo, only to be restored for three subsequent printings from the same setting. Methods of analysis included those of Thoms: comparing multiple copies of what seemed to be the same books, as well as comparing those in a wider context against copies of the three later printings. They also involved examining the paper (which meant of course that only the originals would suffice), tracking running titles as they were reused throughout the book, and analyzing the printer's ornaments, the latter in part to assess contemporary reports about who printed the book. Of the two most significant responses I've had, the more useful has been the one that confirmed my conclusions— useful not because that person agreed with me, but because he had duplicated some of my work, determined that my report of the evidence was accurate, and judged that my interpretation best accounted for the physical features of the book. The disappointing one came from an eighteenth-century scholar who merely said, "They didn't do things that way." His comment neither added insights that would strengthen my argument nor provided objections that could be used to test my case. To refuse to reconsider assumptions is simply not a way to advance understanding. The bibliographical investigation of this set of the publications has incidentally led to a number of other glimpses into their role in their immediate culture. It has revealed that an advertisement in the duodecimo for a poem called "The Progress of Dulness" was false—and that what investigators might consider to be documentary evidence was actually Pope's ruse for disguising authorship from those who had heard he was writing what became known as The Dunciad. (The advertised title had in fact been Pope's original one, but he changed it when he realized that the spine label would be "Pope's Dulness.") Identification of variants brings to light social dynamics by showing how published Keys that tried to identify the poem's characters prompted responses from Pope in subsequent editions. The complex but identifiable pattern of production over five impressions provides detailed insight as well into how working-class folk went about their jobs in a small printing shop two hundred years ago. The analysis has also revealed modern prevarication by bringing to light a leaf that Wise had supplied in a copy now at the University of Texas and on which he had based some of his argument with Griffith. Finally, the fruits of comparing copies remind us in a more general way that, for any era, not all texts of a work are necessarily the same as each other. When, for instance, we read Robert Darnton's oft-reprinted essay "What is the History of Books?" our understanding is affected by the form of the piece that we encounter, and it is increased if we are clear about what the text is that we have before us. Did Rigaud order thirty copies of an edition on "August 16, 1770," as most of the sources listed in note 2 above have it, or on "6 August 1770," as only in Books and Society in History, which falls in the middle of the series of reprintings? 16 16. Daedalus, p. 69; Books and Society, p. 8; Reading in America, p. 32; Kiss of Lamourette, p. 114; Book History Reader, p. 11. Did crates of books have to be "sealed at the point of entry into France" or (as Books and Society in History uniquely indicates) were they to be "unsealed at the point of entry into France"? 17 17. Daedalus, p. 73; Books and Society, p. 12; Reading in America, p. 37; Kiss of Lamourette, p. 120; Book History Reader, p. 16. Is the well-known chart of "The Communications Circuit" intended to include "Trees | Sheep | Papyrus" (as it does in the form reproduced in Thomas R. Adams and Nicolas Barker's essay "A New Model for the Study of the Book"), or is it not? 18 18. The Adams and Barker essay appears in A Potencie of Life, ed. Barker (1993), pp. 5-43 (chart on p. 11). A note of acknowledgment on p. 43 indicates that the figure is reprinted from Daedalus. The chart appears on these pages elsewhere: Daedalus, p. 68; Books and Society, p. 6; Reading in America, p. 31; Kiss of Lamourette, p. 112; Book History Reader, p. 12. 7. Recognizing the cultural values inherent in design elements Stanley Morison, Politics and Script: Aspects of Authority and Freedom in the Development of Graeco-Latin Script from the Sixth Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D. (The Lyell Lectures 1957), ed. and completed by Nicolas Barker. Oxford: Clarendon, 1972. Repr. Oxford: Clarendon, 2000, for Sandpiper Books. Chapter 2: "From Rustic to Half Uncial" (pp. 41-86). The theme of Stanley Morison's 1957 Lyell Lectures Politics and Script likewise is that details of physical artifacts can reveal the past. Morison achieves breadth through focus: his specific topic is the revelatory power of the very forms of alphabetical letters, but he tracks his narrow subject in calligraphic, inscriptional, and printed forms over twenty-five centuries and on surfaces of papyrus, vellum, paper, stone and marble, and precious metals. The appearances of printed letters play an important but relatively small role here, for printed forms occur only in the final half millennium of this grand sweep. His premise is that "The grammatically or philologically accurate transcription of a set of alphabetical signs may not always exhaust the suggestions of the text"; more specifically, "the physical form of an inscription, manuscript, book, newspaper, or other medium of record" can "reveal considerations that appertain to the history of something distinct from religion, politics, and literature, namely: the history of the use of the intellect. So far, that is, as intellect has made its record in script, inscription, or type" (p. 1). His book is not a paleography manual, he points out, but "rather, a detection of some of the causes outside the artists' and workmen's shops that have changed the alphabetical lettering employed in the West for literary and other purposes" (p. 2). Our alphabet, in other words, has been shaped by large cultural factors, chief of which Morison's wide survey leads him to infer as political and religious authority. Morison therefore attempts "to select the forms that are in common use today and to show that much of their long career has been conditioned by movements in religion and politics, friction between Church and State, and schisms between Eastern and Western Christendom" (p. 3). By examining these markers carefully, then, we can find patterns behind them, and ones of far greater significance than might first appear. The grand scale of Morison's study makes it difficult to comprehend the full force of his argument by stepping into it mid-stream, but one convenient place to observe his approach is in Chapter 2, where he addresses a particular historical question. In the aftermath of Constantine's rule as emperor in the early fourth century, significant changes occurred in the dominant letter forms; why? By working back from the artifactual evidence, Morison is able to reconstruct the likely thinking of the era. Earlier he showed that square capitals conveyed the official authority of the Roman empire, and that for efficiency of speed and space a form known as Rustic ("a supreme invention of the Latin mind in the field of practical learning" [p. 43]) had also developed. "Rustic progressed from the second to the fifth century," he says. "It thereafter declined, except for use in incipits and explicits . Why did this capital script lose favour?" (p. 56). "The answer," he continues, "is that a change of attitude in authority occurred which involved changes in texts and scripts. The change in Court calligraphy followed the change in Court religion" (p. 57). Destruction of Christian libraries by earlier emperors as well as the development of an extensive body of Christian theology generated a great need for the production of books. "For writing this mass of new books the appropriate script would clearly not be one closely associated with the persecutors nor with the books which they had honoured ," and thus "what was looked for by the organizers as the basis of this mass of writing was a new script" (p. 58). Morison then goes on to trace the sources from which such a set of letterforms could draw. Despite his main interest, Morison does in fact look at what goes on in "artists' and workmen's shops" and makes equally interesting inferences about quotidian activities of these fourth- and fifth-century people. For instance, he observes that the characteristics of ink marks on vellum are a function of the way the nib of the pen is cut and therefore reveal its shape. The nature of the cut, meanwhile, affects the kinds of letter forms that can be made and the time and materials required to inscribe a text. From examples of those letters Morison is able to infer that the way the nib was cut gradually changed. From the characteristics that resulted he is able in turn to postulate motives: "Economy of speed, effort, and material was bound to effect a change, and, in time, the old roman Square Capital, as a text script, would first be accelerated and next superseded" (p. 52). In using Morison's book, readers should be aware of the benefit of consulting the original 1972 printing instead of the 2000 "Special edition" that, according to the copyright page, the Oxford University Press produced "for Sandpiper Books Ltd." In the reprint, the photographs (which are crucial to following Morison's arguments) have lost considerable quality, and some (such as the lower image of plate 37 on p. 47) have become nearly illegible. Interestingly, although the online catalogues of OCLC, RLIN, COPAC, and the British Library report hundreds of copies of the 1972 impression, none of them includes the Sandpiper printing. It may be that not one of the thousands of member libraries owns a copy, but it seems more plausible that cataloguers simply have not paid adequate attention to the details of these artifacts. 8. Discovering book producers' intentions David F. Foxon, Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade, rev. and ed. James McLaverty. Oxford: Clarendon, 1991. Chapter 4: "Pope's Text: The Early Works" (pp. 153-195). Sometimes it is possible to learn not only what cultural values informed the production of a book but also what specific intentions guided those who were responsible for its physical characteristics. In Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade David Foxon draws on contemporary documents and the observations of his own sharp eye to pin down responsibilities with far greater certainty than is ordinarily possible. These sources reveal, for instance, that a single setting of type for Pope's Works of 1717 was reimposed to print the volume in small- and large-paper folio and in ordinary-and thick-paper quarto, each aimed at a slightly different market. Pope's involvement in the formal presentation of his writings continued throughout his career. For a glimpse of his control, one might read the chapter "Pope's Text: The Early Works," where Foxon shows Pope tinkering with the use of capital letters and italics, reintroducing italics in the cheaper octavo editions of his Works possibly because, according to Foxon, Pope "felt that the vulgar needed help in reading his work correctly" (p. 196). Foxon's work incidentally calls attention to the relative value of evidence from contemporary records on the one hand and from the artifacts those records describe on the other. The contract stipulates that the quarto was to be printed on two kinds of paper, but examination of the actual books reveals that the quarto was printed on three distinct varieties. There may be a way in which the wording of the contract is accurate, but that interpretation must be consistent with the evidence of the books themselves and, if there is an irreconcilable conflict, yield to it. 9. Assessing the responses of readers Monique Hulvey, "Not So Marginal: Manuscript Annotations in the Folger Incunabula," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 92:2 (1998), 159-176. The effect that the presentation of a text actually has on its readers is a related but quite different matter from the effect the producers intended to create. The actual impact on readers is one of the hardest relationships to determine, at least with any certainty, but nonetheless is an area in which possibilities quickly drift into probabilities in the minds of their proposers, without the hindrance of supporting evidence. The easiest situation for ascertaining results occurs when annotations appear in the margins of the book in question. Monique Hulvey's study "Not So Marginal: Manuscript Annotations in the Folger Incunabula" shows not only that early manuscript notations can be guides to the transmission of the text but especially that "readers' annotations document individual reading habits and suggest the kind of dialogue which took place between Renaissance readers and their books" (pp. 161-162). Psychological studies likewise measure with some confidence the effect of textual features on readers. Periodicals such as Visible Language or Applied Ergonomics carry numerous reports on the effects on perception of elements such as line length, spacing, right-margin justification , and serifs. The greatest challenge is to determine whether and how textual features have actually had an aesthetic influence. Consider the following example. Some seventeenth-century editions of the Westminster Catechism have the catechetical text completely surrounded by notes, which are the Biblical verses adduced in support of the theological statements. Has this arrangement influenced readers to think that Scripture is "marginal" here, or is that interpretation merely equivocation on the term "marginal," with a better explanation being that the layout has persuaded readers that the catechism is embedded in Scripture? The question is an historical one and must be answered by historical evidence rather than by commitment to a conclusion the examiners wish to establish. But for present purposes the point is that no answer at all can make sense, or the question even arise, without awareness of the artifact itself. 10.

The very recognition that books are perhaps our most common artifacts from the past has created a problem, one that passenger pigeons also faced. Because printed artifacts are plentiful, individual copies often are thought to be expendable. We have seen the ramifications vividly with newspapers, as libraries desiring to replace bulky volumes with compact microfilms turn for justification to union lists that report many original sets elsewhere, not realizing that those other libraries have used the same reasoning and have likewise discarded their originals. My final proposal is one that also could have begun the list, for it speaks to a fundamental question: should original printed artifacts be saved? The most widespread airing this question has ever had was generated by Nicolson Baker's article "Deadline" in the New Yorker of 24 July 2000 and his book Double Fold the following year. The starting point of Baker's concern was the British Library's disposal of 60,000 volumes of foreign newspapers, a puzzling reversal of the trend elsewhere in the library world to integrate far-flung holdings, as through international union catalogues. A convenient overview of issues involved appears in a series of contributions to the Times Literary Supplement from August 2000 to September 2001. Those articles and letters began with a two-page "Commentary" by the noted scholar and TLS regular Henry Woudhuysen entitled "Vandals of Colindale." In it he surveyed the British Library's activities, Baker's largely unsuccessful efforts to save the volumes, and some questions such dispersals raise. His account touched off related contributions over the next year, including from Lynne Brindley, Chief Executive of the British Library, and from scholar G. Thomas Tanselle. Brindley's first response, "Pulp Fiction about the BL," conveniently summarizes the common defense of microfilm, the medium in which some of the discarded papers were retained: its purported durability, its low storage cost, and its reproducibility. She added, however, "We appreciate that in some cases there are elements of colour, a feel of the paper, or fine detail, which will not be captured on microfilm"— not identifying cases in which microfilm would capture, say, "a feel of the paper," and in any event implying that access to such characteristics is an extraneous luxury rather than essential to all readers for understanding those documents in full. Tanselle addressed the most frequently heard justification for not preserving originals: financial constraints. In "The British Library," he pointed out that "Budgets reflect the priorities of the moment; when there is enough interest in spending money differently, budgets change." Tanselle also talks directly about the importance of original artifacts. His words from "Not the Real Thing" are worth quoting here as a succinct one-paragraph summary of many of the points I have tried to make. He writes this: The reasons why reproduced forms of texts can never be fully adequate substitutes for the originals can be outlined simply, in four statements: (1) Reproductions of all kinds may be defective or incomplete (problems that are not necessarily obvious), or they may be partially illegible (as are many old microfilms now held by libraries); the originals will always be of value as the ultimate authority for settling the questions that reproductions inevitably raise. (2) Physical features that are unreproducible or customarily unreproduced— such as paper, binding, structure of the sewn gatherings, inking—can reveal information about the production history of a book or periodical, information that is relevant to assessing how the text got to be what it is. (3) The unreproducible features of graphic design are part of the evidence readers need for understanding how the content of the text was regarded by the publisher (who chose to present the work this way), and by the original readers (who responded to these features along with the words); without those details, one is deprived of part of the experience of gaining historical understanding. (4) Some verbal works make use of visual effects that can no more be satisfactorily reproduced for all purposes than can other works of visual art; furthermore, knowing when one is in the presence of such a work may require seeing the original. Though D. F. McKenzie did not always hold the bibliographical analysis of printed artifacts in the highest regard, he nonetheless provided one of the most eloquent expressions of the importance of original artifacts. Here is what he said in his Bibliographical Society Centenary Lecture "What's Past is Prologue" in 1992: Once we accept the premise that the forms themselves encode the history of their production, it follows that to abstract what we're told is their `verbal information content' by transferring it to another medium is to contradict the very assumption that the artefact is the product of a distinctive complex of materials, labour, and mentality. As we've seen, even blank books are far from uninformative. Any simulation (including re-presentation in a database—a copy of a copy) is an impoverishment , a theft of evidence, a denial of more exact and immediate visual and tactile ways of knowing, a destruction of their quiddity as collaborative products under the varying historical conditions of their successive realisations. (p. 24) It is difficult to know what else to say after two such lucid statements about the significance of books in human experience. I will, therefore, simply conclude with this reiteration: printed artifacts lie at the core of book history, and keeping them as the focal point not only can give coherence to the field but also can stimulate the richest development of it as a means for understanding cultural and social evolution. How might we best read book history? By going to the books.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ASPECTS OF ITALIAN PRINTED MUSIC OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">by Stanley Boorman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE earliest printed music was presented in two different layouts on the page, both derived directly from those used in manuscripts. The first publisher of music (Ottaviano Petrucci, working in Venice in 1501) used both layouts: for many of his titles, he presented compositions in separate partbooks, so that each voice (or, later, instrument) had a separate book, much in the manner that modern orchestral musicians play from separate parts. For his successors, most books were in quarto or octavo, the choice depending on the repertoire presented. This was by far the commonest method of printing music, and will be the focus of the present study. At the same time, some prestigious volumes (of mass settings, in particular) were printed in what is called "choir-book" layout, with the music which each musician was to sing printed in a different part of the two pages of an opening . Later, and not before the seventeenth century, some music was printed in score, with all the parts synchronised and laid out one below another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Books in choir-book layout or in score presented some problems for the compositor, mostly concerning casting-off and adjusting spacing to allow for different densities of notation for simultaneous music. These problems did not arise when working with partbooks, although the compositor would still have to adjust the spacing of the music to that of the text, or vice-versa. This was difficult only in multiple-impression printing (most frequently found in liturgical books), when music and text were printed at separate passes through the press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, partbooks for a single title do raise problems for the modern bibliographer, in deciding whether or not they are to be treated as separate units. 1 1. I am grateful to the readers of this paper for their comments on this issue, which have led me to clarify many details of my presentation. The easy solution would be to see them as parts of a larger work, akin to the volumes of a multi-volume prose work, even though, textually, they do not work in that manner. The contents of the different partbooks are to be "read", performed, simultaneously; one book is useless alone, for it contains only one voice-part for a multi-voice composition. Further, there is no evidence that single partbooks were ever intended to be sold alone, without the other books of a title. For many titles, the dedicatory letter or a publisher's letter to the reader appears in only one partbook of the set, and even an index may not be in all books—although that is often a result of a shortage of space. Finally, many sets of parts are signed consecutively through the set, from one partbook to the next, and some are even foliated similarly. All these features suggest that the set of parts was seen by the publisher and user as a single unit, only complete when all parts were present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the other side, apparently suggesting that each partbook was thought of as a separate item, is the fact that, after the earliest years of the sixteenth century, all partbooks had full title-pages, with publication details. In practice , this was necessary for most users, for a set of parts was often not kept together. Instead, sets of Tenor books from a number of editions would be bound together—for they would be sung by the same person—and the corresponding Cantus or Bassus books similarly kept together. But this was a matter of convenience, not a reflection of the relationship between part and whole. It is perhaps analogous to the way in which collections of maps were made up, with a selection that met the needs of the owner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If, as I suggest, musical partbooks are seen as strictly part of a single unit, the collation of a set of parts can also be seen as a unit, presented on one line. I believe that printers and publishers saw the books in that way, although they did not always arrange the parts in the same order—Cantus before Tenor before Altus before Bassus. The indication of which part is in a reader's hand does not appear on the direction line, but only on the title-page and headline: because of these features (discussed below), I suggest the addition of editorial indications of the part-names on the collation line— initial letters in brackets with a colon, so that they may not be confused with editorial signatures, as in the following examples. 2 2. With multiple volumes in a set of prose, brackets have not been used to surround the indicator "Vol. I:", etc. However, the letters used to indicate part-names in my musical collations could easily be confused with actual signatures, especially since some printers used various marks of punctuation, including parentheses and colons. This provides the evidence for printers following differing patterns of work, and even for stylistic change in the music itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It also avoids the extensive use of preceding superscripts to indicate repeated signatures: the part-name (abbreviated) is sufficient to distinguish signatures re-appearing in different partbooks, as in Example 43, below. Superscripts are reserved for repetitions within a single partbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The part-name indication is not always necessary in the continuation of a description. When each partbook in a set is signed differently, the signature itself identifies a folio absolutely: only when partbooks repeat signatures is it necessary to distinguish them, and I propose the simple solution given after Example 47.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first three decades of the sixteenth century the period of Ottaviano Petrucci, Andrea Antico, and the Doricos, saw the gradual establishment of standardised procedures for music printing. The following period, roughly that of the second third of the sixteenth century, the period of Antonio Gardano and Girolamo Scotto, saw the appearance in Italy of single- impression type-faces, various techniques fairly stabilised, and methods of production well organised: some of these techniques, such as "vertical composition", 3 3. The most frequent manner of setting a series of partbooks was to complete one book at a time, before moving on to the next. Mary Lewis has adopted the term "vertical composition " for a different procedure, in which the same forme (the first of the second gathering, for example) in every partbook was set before the compositor moved on to the next forme. This was primarily useful for anthologies where each composition took only one page—the same page—in each partbook. As a result, some material—the initial letter, the caption, the composer's name—could remain in the forme for all parts. See Mary S. Lewis, Antonio Gardano, Venetian Music Printer 1538-1569: A Descriptive Bibliography and Historical Study (New York: Garland, 1988- ), vol. 1, pp. 68-75. See also Donna G. Cardamone and David L. Jackson, "Multiple Formes and Vertical Setting in Susato's First Edition of Lassus' `Opus 1' ", Notes, 46 (1989-1990), 7-24. seem to have been new, and a response to the special opportunities offered by repertoires such as madrigals and canzonets. But, by the last decade of the century, we enter a period in which many printers appear to have had difficulty in planning their books efficiently. To some extent, this is probably a result of the changes in style that emerge at the end of the sixteenth century. The appearance of monodic and continuo-supported solo song and motet, sometimes printed in score; the need to present different compositions within the same book in differing layouts on the page: all these helped to reduce the viability of the standard typesetting procedures that had prevailed in the 1550s to 1580s, and the problems were certainly compounded with the emergence of music printers who seem not to have had a systematic mind-set, nor the practical non-musical experience of earlier craftsmen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many printers therefore abandoned "vertical setting" entirely, and lost the benefits of consistency and clear organisation that went with it. Others adopted patterns of format and signing which are remarkably diverse, and (on occasion) seem to be almost haphazard. Not infrequently, we must find it difficult to conceive how the printer could have had a full volume of copy before him and yet have worked as he did. Indeed, the evidence often indicates some change of plan, such as a belated expansion in the content of a book. At the same time, however, it will usually tell us less about the music itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This article comprises a series of illustrations of printers' habits and bibliographical curiosities, drawn from Italian music printing of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They are accompanied by suggestions as to how to describe the printed books bibliographically, and (where feasible) by commentary on their implications for the musical content and its organisation . As far as possible, the descriptive suggestions are built on the methodology outlined by Fredson Bowers, although some minor adaptations are proposed. 4 4.

Evidently, while I have tried to cite only copies that I have examined myself, in the library or (rarely) on microfilm, some of the examples cited below have been drawn to my attention by other scholars working in the field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Standard abbreviations are used in what follows: A = Alto/Altus; B = Basso/Bassus: BC = Basso Continuo (or any of the related titles, for example Organo or Partimento ); C = Canto/Cantus; T = Tenor/Tenore; 5 = Quinto/Quintus; 6 = Sesto/Sextus; etc. Books are given conventional titles, rather than formal transcriptions of their title-pages. Editions are identified by their sigla in the Répertoire international des sources musicales (hereafter RISM ): entries with an initial letter followed by a number are found in Einzeldrucke vor 1800, ed.

      <field name="fulltext">I. Signatures Normal Patterns The most common format for printed music produced during the mid-sixteenth century is well known. Works were printed in partbooks, in quarto (either portrait or landscape). Each partbook was distinguished from the others by two indications. The first was, of course, the part name— Tenor, Cantus Chorus Secundus, etc.—which normally appeared on the title-page, and also on at least one headline of each opening. The other comprised two elements, the system of signatures, and an additional phrase, usually an abbreviated title of the book, printed on first folios of most gatherings. 5 5. This abbreviated title appears on the direction line, usually on the first folio of each sheet—therefore on the first of each gathering in quarto—with the exception of the sheets containing title-pages. For example, the early editions of the most frequently-reprinted music book of the sixteenth century, the first book of four-voiced madrigals by Arcadelt, have slightly different titles. Two editions were published by Antonio Gardano in 1541 (both listed in RISM as 1541 9 ): one has the line "Primo Libro d'Archadelt" (with a final period only on folio R1 r ); the other has the same two versions, though in italic. The third edition, put out by Ottaviano Scotto ( RISM 1541 10 ), has a similar line, though in a mix of italic and roman type: "P rimo libro d' A rchadelte. " Gardano's edition of 1554 ( RISM A1323 = c.1551 12 ) has a line reading Archadelt Primo a 4. At other times, as in the case of some books printed by Petrucci, Pierre Attaingnant and Tylman Susato (among others), 6 6. For descriptions of the books produced by these printers or publishers, see Stanley Boorman, Ottaviano Petrucci: Catalogue Raisonné (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2005); Daniel Heartz, Pierre Attaingnant, Royal Painter of Music: A Historical Study and Bibliographical Catalogue (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1969); and Ute Meissner, Der Antwerpener Notendrucker Tylman Susato: eine bibliographische Studie zur niederländischen Chansonpublikationen in der ersten Hälfte des 16. Jahrhunderts, Berliner Studien zur Musikwissenschaft, 11 (Berlin: Merseburger, 1967), with Kristine Forney, Tielman Susato, Sixteenth-Century Printer: An Archival and Typographical Investigation (Ph.D. dissertation , Univ. of Kentucky, 1978). this phrase was replaced by a typographical emblem or sign, which would differ from those used in other partbooks or other titles. Taken together, these acted for the binder as a confirmation that he was collecting together only the sheets for that one title, and arranging them in the correct order. Normally, therefore, each partbook had a different sequence of signatures, often selected so that the whole series formed a continuous alphabetical sequence. The following examples start from the standard practice of the sixteenth century and diverge into a number of different situations and solutions, all within the basic concept of a sequence of signing letters uniting all the books of a set. 1. Massaino: Quaerimoniae . . . Op. 34. Venice: Alessandro Raverio, 1609. RISM M1288. Copy at Lodi, Duomo, Archivio Capitolare. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 ; [B:] N-Q 4 ; [5:] R-V 4 . This was the most widespread pattern for much of the sixteenth century : the Cantus partbook was almost always signed first in sequence (whenever it was actually set in type), and the Tenor normally second. The Bassus usually appears fourth, after the Altus, and before any subsequent parts— Quintus, etc. This sequence reflected a traditional hierarchy of voices in composition and style, although that hierarchy was largely obsolete well before the middle of the sixteenth century. The pattern would necessarily be modified whenever the music did not fit exactly into a sequence of standard quarto gatherings. 2. Stivori: II Sacrarum Cantionum. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1593. RISM S6447. Copy at Kassel, Landesbibliothek und Murharsche Bibliothek . Quarto: [C:] A-B 4 C 6 ; [T:] D-E 4 F 6 ; [A:] G-H 4 I 6 ; [B:] K-L 4 M 6 ; [5:] N-O 4 P 6 ; [6:] Q 4 R 6 ; [7:] S 4 . 3. Chamatero: II Madrigali à 5. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1569. RISM C275=1569 26 . Copy at Kassel, Landesbibliothek und Murharsche Bibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A-C 4 D 2 ; [T:] E-G 4 H 2 ; [A:] I-L 4 M 2 ; [B:] N-P 4 Q 2 ; [5:] R-T 4 V 2 . The principal parts for each of these books all contain 14 folios, though imposed differently. The Amadino edition supposes that Amadino had decided to have a six-folio last gathering before reaching the middle of gathering C and its equivalents. This was not necessary for Scotto. While Scotto often followed the pattern of Example 3, other printers tended to adopt the other. But all are still following the normal sequence of letters, and signing the parts in the conventional order. This conventional sequence of signatures seems to have been taken seriously during much of the sixteenth century: care is taken to ensure that all the letters are used, and in the correct order within books. In one case, the Gardano firm prepared a book in which the last partbook, the Sextus, apparently started two signature letters too late: a correction was made in the preceding part, by signing gathering T with "T.V.X." and "T.V.X.ij": 4. Agostini: Canones, et Echo à 5. Venice: Figliuoli di Antonio Gardano, 1572. RISM A405=1572 13 . Copy at Augsburg, Staats- und Stadtbibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 ; [B:] N-Q 4 ; [5:] R-T 4 ; [6:] Y-Z 4 AA 4 . For the next example, the only surviving partbook has a similar signing: the last of five gatherings was signed with the double letters "EF". Presumably , the next partbook (probably the Tenor), was signed from the letter G. 5. II delle Muse à 3. Canzon villanesche alla Napolitana. Rome: Antonio Barrè, 1557. RISM 1557 13 . Copy at Leipzig, Städtische Bibiotheken, Musikbibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 EF 4 . This order of parts was not always maintained. Girolamo Scotto was one printer who varied the order of partbooks, even from early in his career. Particularly interesting for an analysis of his craftsmen's activities is the way in which different orders of signing seem to occur only for short periods. The pattern shown here, for example, can be found in a number of books published in 1549, with the Bassus signed first, followed by Cantus, Altus, Tenor and fifth or further books: 7 7. This example is taken from Jane A. Bernstein, Music Printing in Renaissance Venice: The Scotto Press (1539-1572) (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1999), which contains considerable evidence from which one could build up a detailed picture of house-practice in Scotto's printing shop. 6. Gero: II Madrigali à 4 a notte negre. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1549. RISM G1648. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [B:] A-C 4 ; [C:] D-F 4 ; [T:] K-M 4 . Note. The Altus partbook is not extant but must have been signed with the letters G-I. Scotto was certainly not the only printer to adopt different orders of books, though his examples are perhaps the most consistent within themselves . 8 8. A curious example from his work concerns an edition of Arcadelt's first book of       madrigals (RISM A1319=1544 15 ), put out by Scotto in 1544 and signed as follows: [T:] A-F 4 ; [A:] G-M 4 ; [B:] N-S 4 ; [C:] T-Z 4 AA 1 . The book had already gone through several editions, and, although Scotto did rearrange the contents for this edition, it is difficult to see why the Cantus part should have been signed last. Other printers adopted various patterns at odd times, with no apparent reason: 7. Naich: Exercitum Seraficum. I Madrigali à 4-5. Rome: Antonio Blado [in or before 1544]. RISM N7. Unique copy at Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. Quarto: [A:] A-F 4 ; [T:] G-M 4 ; [B:] N-R 4 ; [C:] S-Y 4 ; [5:] a 4 b 6 . 8. Has quatuor missas à 4,5,8. Rome: Giovanni Pietro Collini, 1651. RISM 1651 1 . Copies at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale and Lucca, Seminario Vescovile. Quarto: Choir I: [C:] A 18 ; [A:] B 18 ; [T:] C 16 ; [B:] D 16 ; [Bassus ad Organum:] E 16 ; Choir II: [B:] F 8 ; [T:] G 8 ; [C:] H 10 ; [A:] I 10 . Such patterns must say something about the order in which the partbooks were set for the press, but, in the absence of any other evidence, we can not speculate as to possible reasons for the unusual sequence—in Example 8 because the two choirs are not set and signed in the same order. A different pattern was increasingly adopted during the seventeenth century, in which the Altus was signed before the Tenor: 9. Cazzati: Antifone, letanie e Te Deum à 8, Op. 19. Bologna: Gioseffo Micheletti, 1686. RISM C1608. Copy at Lucca, Seminario Vescovile. Quarto: Choir I: [C] A 16 ; [A:] B 16 ; [T:] C 16 ; [B:] D 16 ; Choir II: [C:] E 16 ; [A:] F 16 ; [T:] G 16 ; [B:] H 16 ; [Organo:] I 14 . 10. Scelta di motetti de diversi. Rome: Lodovico Grignani, 1647. RISM 1647 1 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C1:] A-B 12 ; [C2:] C 12 D 10 ; [A:] E 16 ; [T:] F 10 ; [B:] G 8 ; [Organo:] H 18 . It seems reasonable to suggest that this followed, with the delay traditional to craft skills, a recognition of the declining pre-eminence of the Tenor in the construction of sacred music. It would be interesting to trace the stages at which different publishers adopted this arrangement as normal practice. The rather random evidence that I have collected so far suggests that Filippo Lomazzo in Milan was among the first, for the pattern appears in editions he put out with the Tini heirs in 1607 (B. Regio: I Missarum ac sacrarum cantionum à 5, 8, RISM R725) and 1608 (Baglioni: I Sacrarum Cantionum, Op. 2, RISM B644) and it continues throughout his career: he was followed by Rolla (although with a few exceptions, such as Levi's I Salmi di Terza of 1647). Roman printers soon followed suit, for the Altus is signed second in books by Bartolomeo Zannetti in 1614 ( Selectae Cantiones, RISM 1614 3 ), by Luc' Antonio Soldi from 1620 (Tarditi, II Psalmi [etc.], RISM T225), by Giovanni Battista Robletti from 1622 (Nenna: Sacrae hebdomodae responsoria à 5, RISM N381), though not consistently, and by Paolo Masotti from his earliest editions in 1626 (Talone, Armonicus parnasus à 3-4, Op. 1, RISM T62). Lodovico Grignani was using this arrangement by 1647. On the other hand, the two principal publishing families in Venice, the Magni and Vincenti, both preserved the traditional arrangement for much longer: for Vincenti, the change occurred during the years 1649 and 1650. In 1649 his edition of Capuana's Motets, Op. 3 ( RISM R952) uses the new sequence of parts: although this rapidly became the norm, at least one edition of 1650 retained the old order. For Magni, the change seems to have come even later, perhaps as late as 1660. Bolognese publishers had certainly adopted the new sequence by then: indeed Cazzati takes the practice somewhat further, in that solo instrumental parts are signed first, even before the principal vocal parts: for his Messa e salmi à 5, Op. 36 (Bologna: M. Silvani, 1665), the violin parts are signed with A and B, and the Alto Viola with C; solo vocal parts use D-H and the Ripieno I-L, with the two continuo parts signed M and N. The same pattern can be found in his later books, though not consistently: Le quattro Antifone annuale, Op. 42 (Bologna: s.n., 1667) has the single vocal part signed with C, with the two violin parts using A and B and the Organ part D. However, his Salmi brevi à 4, Op. 58 signs both choirs of singers before any instruments. If the set of books used more than 23 gatherings, the series could be extended with a few conventional signs—an asterisk, an obelus, even an ampersand: 11. Motetti del frutto, I à 6. Venice: Antonio Gardano, 1539. RISM 1539 3 . Copy at Verona, Academia Filarmonica. Landscape quarto: [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [B:] I-M 4 ; [A:] N-Q 4 ; [5:] R-V 4 ; [6:] X-Z 4 * 4 . Note. This is another case where the traditional order of signing books has been changed, in this instance with the Bassus signed earlier in the sequence than the Altus. In his first book of five-voiced Motetti del frutto, of 1538, Gardano signed the Bassus before the Tenor book. If several gatherings were involved, a second alphabet of signatures would become essential. Ideally (and normally during the sixteenth century), this second alphabet would be distinguished from the first by some simple typographical device (perhaps an asterisk following the letter), or, for example , with the use of doubled letters: 12. Villani: V Psalmi à 8. Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1611. RISM V1554. Copy at Piacenza, Archivio e Biblioteca Capitolare. Quarto: Choir I: [C] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 ; [B] N-Q 4 ; Choir II: [C:] R-V 4 ; [T:] X-Z 4 Aa 4 ; [A:] Bb-Ee 4 ; [B:] Ef-Ii 4 . This pattern of four gatherings per partbook, each with four folios in portrait quarto, is surprisingly common, given the wide variety of styles that were included in printed books. It is as if the printers and publishers felt that 16 folios contained as much music (with title, table of contents, and perhaps dedication) as the average purchaser was willing to pay for, or perform. It is even to be found fairly frequently in music for two choirs: apart from Examples 9 and 12, see also Lambardi's Psalmodia Vespertina II of 1605 (printed by the Cenobio Santo Spirito in Venice) or Sorte's Vespertina (Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1593), among many others. The use of small gatherings, usually in quarto, would continue for many years. But already before 1600, Vincenti was printing in longer gatherings , and signing them as in the next examples: 13. F. Anerio: I Sacri Hymni à 8. Venice: Giacomo Vincenti, 1596. RISM A1080. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: Choir I: [C:] A 12 ; [T:] B 12 ; [A:] C 12 ; [B:] D 12 ; Choir II: [C:] E 12 ; [T:] F 12 ; [A:] G 12 ; [B:] H 12 . 14. Sacra Corona. Motetti à 2-3. Venice: Francesco Magni, 1656. RISM 1656 1 . Copy at Washington, Library of Congress. Quarto: [C1:] A 40 ; [C2:] B 42 ; [B:] C 32 ; [ Basso Continuo: ] D 32 . Such large gatherings could raise a problem for the print-shop: the house foreman had to be able to cast off copy fairly accurately, so that a compositor would be sure of the size of a gathering and sheets could be set and printed without any fear of miscalculation. Sometimes, things did not quite work out: the compositor might decide too soon that he had reached the midpoint of the gathering, and start to complete the central formes. The result could then be a need for a short additional gathering at the end of a part-book : 15. Bonetto: Mottecta à 1-12. Venice: Francesco Magni, 1662. RISM B3466. Copy at Wroclaw, Biblioteka Uniwersytecka. Quarto: [C1:] A 64 2 A 4 ; [5:] E 20 2 E 4 ; [Organo:] I 48 K 56 ; [etc.] The first gathering of the Cantus is signed normally, from A2, with arabic numerals. The second gathering is signed on the first sheet with the phrase "A in fine" and on the second with "A2". After 32 folios, the compositor was apparently confident that he was about at the middle of his material, but on reaching the end, he found that there was a little more, necessitating a supplementary gathering. A similar miscalculation marks all the partbooks, and is reflected in the organ book, where the second gathering has to be slightly larger than the first. 9 9. Similar evidence can be found in a number of seventeenth-century editions, even when the gatherings are not particularly large. For example, Califabri's Scelta de'Motetti da cantarsi à 2-3 (Rome: Jacomo Fei, 1665: RISM 1665 1 ) has a Basso book, in quarto, which collates C 12 D 2 . The Canto and Organo have single gatherings, both larger than the Basso. 16. Cazzati: Compieta e letanie à 4, Op. 7. Venice: Alessandro Vincenti, 1647. RISM C1585. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A 14 Aa 2 ; [T:] B 16 ; [A:] C 14 Cc 2 ; [B:] D 16 ; [ Basso Continuo: ] H-I 12 . In this book, it seems that the compositor for the Tenor book had learned from the experience with the Cantus or Altus book. Some editions appear to show a compromise solution, in which two signature letters were allocated to each partbook: the second could act to collect together whatever was left after the first had been set up and printed. This probably explains the irregular structure of gatherings in the following example: 17. Has alteras sacras cantiones. Rome: Lodovico Grignani, 1645. RISM 1645 2 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A 12 B 16 ; [T:] C 16 D 14 ; [A:] E 16 ; [B:] F 12 G 10 ; [Organum:] H-I 12 . For some repertories, given the manner in which they were presented, this may have been almost the only possible solution. The many "scores" for solo madrigals and motets, and so on, printed in score layout in a single book, provide an excellent example. The very diverse rhythmic structure of these works, not to mention the presence of recitative sections, produced different amounts of music to the page: as a result, it would be much more difficult to cast off the music in advance. Only a very experienced musicprinting shop could have divided such a book between equal gatherings, or between two compositors. A second result, for long gatherings, is that we can normally assume the presence of many more sorts in the case for a music fount, whenever the musical text could not be cast off in advance. Added Material The following sequence is clearly different, for the conventional signs do not follow on from the end of a complete sequence of 23 letters, but are found in gatherings added at the end of each partbook: 18. Il primo libro de madrigali, a quatro voci. De diversi autori. A notte negre. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1558. RISM 1558 11 . Copy at London, British Library. Landscape quarto: [C:] A-E 4 + 2 ; [T:] F-K 4 ++ 2 ; [B:] Q-V 4 X 2 . Note. The Alto does not survive, but was surely signed L-P 4 +++ 2 . The placing of the conventional Maltese crosses to sign an additional bifolium at the end of each part is significant. The book was apparently planned to have five gatherings in each part, and signatures were assigned accordingly. Either Scotto miscalculated, and had to add pages at the end of each part, or else the editor produced some additional music after printing was well under way. But the book was set by "vertical setting", so that the Tenor gathering F, the Alto L and the Bassus Q were prepared with the Cantus A, and before any other gatherings. Thus is would not have been possible, if adding another gathering at the end of each partbook, to sign it with the next available letter; for example, the sixth Cantus gathering could not have been signed with the letter F without causing potential confusion. Even so, it is significant that the additional pages were not merely added to the last lettered gathering of each book, to make six folios. 10 10. Most printers tended to have a standard manner of dealing with a final half-gathering of music. Gardano always added a further half-gathering, with its own signature. Scotto did more often than not, though it is notable that there were two periods when he ended with a six-folio gathering—the year 1541 and the years 1549 to early 1554 (during which the only exception was a new edition of an earlier book). Scotto's heirs, however, preferred to end with a six-folio gathering, as did Angelo Gardano, when succeeding to Antonio's business. At the same time, some of their contemporaries were still signing with short final gatherings. By the end of the century, the longer gatherings had become more popular, partly because more printers were in any case using single long gatherings for each partbook. Even so, a number of publishers put out books with both solutions, during the period 1580-ca. 1660, just as a number were inconsistent in presenting quarto in gatherings of a single sheet or in large gatherings. This suggests that the change came late in the printing process, after much of the work on the last lettered gatherings (E, K and P) had been completed, after the midpoint of those gatherings. Given that the last pieces were additional to the contents found in earlier editions, the late decision to include this new music is the likely explanation. 11 11. Bernstein, Music Printing, No. 163, points out that the contents correspond to those found in the Gardano edition of 1557 (described in Lewis, Antonio Gardano, vol. 2, No. 237), with the addition of three pieces at the end of the book. The first of these is attributed to Costanzo Porta, who (as Lewis suggests in Antonio Gardano, vol. 2, p. 37) was still relatively unknown: he may therefore have had something to do with the addition of music to the end of this often reprinted collection. The same effect can be seen in Rinaldo da Montagnana's first book of five-voiced motets (Gardano 1563), with a Maltese cross for the last gathering of each part, although in other ways that is a normal gathering, with four folios. Once again, it looks as though further pieces were added at a late point in preparing the edition. The last four works, occupying six pages, are for six voices, and the first three of them are by a different composer. It seems reasonable to argue that someone other than the publisher was financially responsible for the book, either paying for it directly, or undertaking to take a large number of copies. This is the easiest explanation of the willingness of the publisher to add a whole gathering to each partbook, with the extra costs of labour and (especially) paper, late in the process. A similar phenomenon occurs in Scotto's edition of the combined first and second books of madrigals by Verdelot, published in 1540: 19. Di Verdelotto Tutti li madrigali del primo, et secondo libro a quatro Voci. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1540. RISM 1228=1540 20 . Copy at Wolfenbüttel, Herzog-August-Bibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A-G 4 H 2 ; [T:] a-g 4 h 2 ; [A:] AA-GG 4 HH 2 ; [B:] aa-gg 4 hh 2 . Here again, we might assume that the short final gathering merely included the few madrigals that were left over and to be included after the completion of gathering G—especially since the edition represents a reprinting of earlier books. But the evidence suggests otherwise: at the foot of G4 v in all partbooks is the word FINIS. Gathering H contains three additional madrigals, attributed to Willaert, Verdelot and Barre, none of which had appeared in earlier editions of either book. 12 12. This is noted in Bernstein, Music Printing, No. 14. Given that Scotto had printed a five-voiced anthology in the same year, in which Willaert and his "discipulo" Leonardo Barre were highly featured on the title-page and were first in the contents, 13 13. RISM 1540 18 , described in Bernstein, Music Printing, No. 15. it seems likely that one of these two composers (probably the younger and less well-known Barre) requested the addition to the present volume. A more complex example of the same situation is the following edition, which started out with partbooks planned to be three gatherings long. Apparently a whole gathering of music was added at some stage. The printer could well have chosen to sign the new gathering according to Example 18, above. The solution actually adopted must have raised questions in the minds of booksellers, binders or others faced with unbound sheets. 20. Metallo: Magnificat a quattro, &amp; a cinque. Venice: Erede di Girolamo Scotto, 1603. RISM M2435. Copy at London, British Library. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] D-F 4 Ff 4 ; [A:] G-K 4 ; [B:] K-M 4 Mm 4 . In this example, two different methods of coping with the problem of pre-assigned signatures were used. Cantus and Altus merely employ the next letter (even though that means a duplication of signatures D and K): Tenor and Bassus use a duplication of the final letter (even though that was not necessary for the Bassus). The implication is probably that two different compositors were involved: there is evidence that, even as late as this volume, compositors had some freedom in presentation, not merely of the verbal text (as commonly elsewhere), but also of the musical notation. Therefore, volumes with this sort of pattern should be examined for evidence of the compositors reaching slightly different editorial decisions both in layout and in details of musical notation. An example such as the following might also suggest that two craftsmen were involved; but further examination indicates clearly that there was a change of plan before the book went on sale: 21. Massaino: Sacri modulorum Concentus à 8, 9-12 . . . Op. 31. Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1606. RISM M1285. Copy at Rome, Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia. Quarto: [C:] A-B 4 C 6 AA 4 BB 6 [C2:] N-O 4 P 6 NN 4 OO 6 [9:] Bd-Dd 4 [T:] D-E 4 F 6 DD 4 EE 6 [T2:] Q-R 4 S 6 QQ 4 RR 6 [10:] Ee-Ff 4 [A:] G-H 6 I 6 GG 4 HH 6 [A2:] T-V 4 X 6 TT 4 VV 6 [11:] Gg 6 [B:] K-L 4 M 6 KK 4 LL 6 [B2:] Y-Z 4 Aa 6 YY 4 ZZ 6 [12:] Hh 6 I have arranged the parts in this tabular fashion, in order to highlight several significant features. The most obvious is the use of the two sets of signatures for each of the first eight partbooks, representing two four-voiced choirs. The ordinary run of signatures for the opening gatherings of these books reached into a second alphabet by the end of the second Bassus, with the entirely conventional use of Aa. These gatherings carry a standard presentation and signing for a book of eight-voiced motets, apparently intended to be complete and self-contained. Folio Aal r has the word "finis" after the signature: this reflects a common practice in Gardano's shop, indicating the last gathering of a set of partbooks. In addition, an index of the preceding pieces is found on folio 6 r of each third gathering of these eight partbooks. After the book was completed in this form, it was expanded to include additional pieces scored for more than eight voices. The additional signatures for these works in the first eight partbooks could not use the pattern "Aa", which had been started in the second Bassus: that was more logically used for the additional partbooks for voices 9-12. For the added gatherings of the original partbooks, a new style had to be adopted, and one with double capital letters, "AA", etc., was employed. 14 14. A more detailed discussion of this instance can be found in Stanley Boorman, "Printed Music Books of the Italian Renaissance from the Point of View of Manuscript Study", Revista de Musicologia, 16 (1993 [=1997]), 2587-2602. Miscalculations In many volumes (principally those not containing madrigals or other secular vocal music), the various partbooks had to be of different sizes, to contain music of differing complexity in the various parts. This would not normally cause a problem in planning the signatures: 22. Portinaro: III Madregali à 5-6. Venice: Antonio Gardano, 1557. RISM P5226. Copy at Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A-C 4 D 2 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 ; [B:] N-Q 4 ; [5:] R-V 4 . In this case, a compositor or his foreman realised that all partbooks would need at least part of a fourth gathering, and planned accordingly. It does not matter which voice-part he used to make the calculation, for all would have yielded the same conclusion. Occasionally, however, the lengths of the various parts might differ significantly. A competent compositor (or house editor) could plan ahead, and assign signatures accordingly, before work started: 23. Brumel: Misse. Venice: Ottaviano Petrucci, 1503. RISM B4643. Copy at Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. Quarto: [S:] A-B 8 C 4 ; [T:] D 10 ; [A:] E-F 8 G 4 ; [B:] H-I 8 . 24. Sabino: V Madrigali à 5-6. Venice: Giacomo Vincenti &amp; Ricciardo Amadino , 1586. RISM S50. Copy at Krakow, Biblioteta Jagielloŉska. Quarto: [C:] A-C 4 ; [T:] D-G 4 ; [A:] H-K 4 ; [B:] L-N 4 ; [5:] O-Q 4 . Note. In the second example, Vincenti and Amadino placed the music for the Sexta Pars in the few pieces with six voices at the end of the Tenor book: they provided for this in the pattern of signatures, in which the Tenor was allocated an extra gathering and signature letter. In some cases, the printer seems not to have been able to foresee this need, and was faced, late in the process, with inserting an extra gathering at the end of one or more of the partbooks: 25. Annibale Padovano: I Ricercari à 4. Venice: Antonio Gardano, 1556. RISM A1250. Copies at London, Royal College of Music, and Szombathely , Püpöski Könyvtár. Quarto: [C:] A-C 4 * 2 ; [T:] D-F 4 + 2 ; [A:] G-I 4 ; [B:] K-N 4 . Here, the original plan had evidently been to have three gatherings for each partbook, though in fact three of the parts required more space, only the Alto conforming to pattern. For the Basso, which was last in sequence, there was no problem in assigning a signature: the additional fourth gathering could be signed with the next letter in the alphabet. For the Canto and Tenore, however, this would have resulted in duplicated letters, and conventional signs were used instead. 15 15. This is also an argument that this book was prepared with "vertical setting", so that the first sheets of the lower voice-parts had already been set before the problem with the Cantus was discovered When an additional gathering had to be inserted in this manner, an alternative method (and one perhaps of more use to the binder) was to use a different form, or a double statement, of the immediately preceding signing letter, as for the Altus of the following example: 26. Animuccia: I Madrigali à 4-6. Venice: Antonio Gardano, 1547. RISM A1421. Copy at Verona, Accademia Filarmonica. Quarto: [C:] A-E 4 ; [T:] F-K 4 ; [A:] L-P 4 PP 2 ; [B:] Q-V 4 ; [5:] X-Z 4 . This example does indeed look as though it represents a miscalculation in the printing shop: but in many cases, we can not tell whether the signatures indicate a change of plan (for example, involving the addition of more compositions) or a miscalculation: 27. Lassus and others: I Missae à 4-5. Milan: Francesco &amp; eredi di Simone Tini, 1588. RISM 1588 4 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 e 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 i 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 n 4 ; [B:] N-R 4 ; [5:] S 4 . 28. Corfini: Il secondo libro de motetti. Venice: Alessandro Gardano, 1581. RISM C3932.

A few general conventions need to be noted for the descriptions. A colon followed by a closing bracket, thus, :] is used to indicate that what precedes is comment, and what follows is a quotation from the specific document or source. If further comment is needed after the quotation, the bracket is reopened. For example: Signatures:] A II [$4 (In the example, A II is an exemplary signature from the item in question.) This formulation also allows me to indicate when there is punctuation at the end of the quoted material. The manner of describing the signing pattern in particular is discussed in detail below, at Example 32. No signatures on title-pages. The first of each two-folio gathering signed in the pattern] D3 In both these cases, I suspect, there was a slip on the part of the printer, who had apparently allocated four gatherings (and signature letters) to each voice part. In the first case, he had discovered the problem before the Quinta Pars was set, so that the Bassus could have a normal fifth signature. In the second, it looks as though Gardano planned the book on the basis of the Tenor part. All the other parts have an extra gathering, and all except the Sesto employ a repeat signature. 17 17. This book is another example of the same situation described in Example 18 above: here again, following the Sesto book, there was no subsequent partbook to use BB-EE. On occasion a section of music is omitted. This could occur because the compositor made a simple mistake, perhaps a haplograph, or because the imposition of the pages in the forme omitted one or two complete pages. The latter seems to be the likely cause of the following: 29. Massaino: Concentus quinque vocum. Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1576. RISM M1266. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 (C4 + 1). The folio after C4 is a single leaf containing omitted material. The leaf has a line reading:] Questa Carta Va posta drieto il numero 22 in Cantus. 18 18. An amusing case of faulty imposition occurs in the 1512 edition of Reuchlin's Scenica progymnasmata (printed in Tübingen by Thomas Anshelm), one of the editions which contains music by Megel. Printed in the middle of folio C4 r , an otherwise empty page, is the note] Erratus est hic in supputatione positionis &amp; nihil omissum. | Verte paginam &amp; mox sequitur Loco uix eredito &amp;c. [thereby also indicating the first three words found on the verso. Unsigned Gatherings Many music books, even as early as from the press of Ottaviano Petrucci, used the same title-page for each part, with the minimal adjustment of changing the part-name. This was eminently practical, saving not simply the labour of setting up the type each time, but also the more time-consuming work of centering each line, and arranging the whole into a standardised, possibly pleasing ensemble. By early in the seventeenth century, this practice was sometimes extended from a simple title-page to a complete bifolio, with title on the first recto, and perhaps a dedication, a Letter to the Reader, or a table of contents on the other three pages. Very frequently, these two folios, which needed no change except for the part-name, could be printed as a separate gathering. Then, this initial gathering need not be signed, so that even the signature would not need to be changed. 30. Graziani: Hinni Vespertini, Op. 21. Rome: successori ai Mascardi, 1674. RISM G3690.

In the next example, Muti's compositor allowed for the unsigned gatherings of lower partbooks in his signing pattern: 31. Graziani: I Messe à 4-5, Op. 18. Rome: Giovanni Angelo Mutii, 1671. RISM G3685. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale.

This book illustrates one situation where music in parts benefits from a slight modification to standard practice. The conventional pattern, for example $1-2, is fine for single books (such as choirbooks) , and works well when all gatherings are of the same size, as in many examples above. If only one or two gatherings are anomalous , the pattern can still be followed with an entry such as "$1-2, +C3, F3", or as for this example. But there are many books, as in Example 2 above, where each partbook has the same pattern, of four-folio gatherings signed to folio 2, and a final six-folio gathering signed to 3: and there are others, such as Example 21, which include gatherings of two sizes. In these cases, the compositor normally signed the longer gatherings to folio 3. Then, it is simpler to use the formulation "$1-2, 1-3", with the implication that the different signing patterns correspond to the different gathering sizes. This is a valuable modification of Bowers' practice, not so much because his pattern causes problems in understanding what happened , but because this formulation makes clear that the signing patterns are completely straightforward and normal. In this case, it is certain that two craftsmen were involved, and that there was little contact between them. One man set the Cantus, Tenor and Organ books, using the common pattern in which each partbook was signed sequentially starting with A: it is interesting, too, that he seems to have intended to use a different form of the letter for each book, in the manner shown in Examples 34-36. As was customary, the Organ was signed as if independent of the rest of the parts. The second man set the Altus and Bassus according to the pattern I have just been describing, and assumed (without checking) that Cantus and Tenor would be signed A and B respectively , therefore beginning the Altus with the letter C. The following book shows a common extension of this seventeenth- century practice of an introductory gathering, one that implies a certain lavishness in presentation and the use of white space, a lavishness often at odds with the poor quality of type, paper, and workmanship. 19 19. I will return to this book later, in discussing its collation and signature pattern. 33. Cazzati: Salmi di Terza, Op. 53. Bologna: s.n., 1669. RISM C1654. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: nine partbooks, signed sequentially A-I. Note. In each partbook, a preliminary gathering of four folios is taken up with preliminary material, in the following manner: A1 r , blank; A1 v , blank; A2 r , Half-title; A2 v , blank; A3 r Title; A3 v , blank; A4 r , Dedication; A4 v blank. This was obviously laid out so that it could be used in every partbook, with only the part-name changed. Despite the extravagant use of paper, a large number of seventeenth-century musical books seem to have had half-titles , and quite a few also had a blank folio, preceding that or the title. In many cases, of course, these blank folios have subsequently become lost, or (more probably) used for some other purpose. Yet it is an aspect of describing these books that we determine whether what looks like a fly-leaf was not in fact a blank first folio of the book itself. Diverse Styles in the Same Edition Most of the above examples have started from what was by far the most common pattern, that of a sequential alphabet, followed through all the gatherings of each partbook. Among the possible alternatives, two were frequently used: one involved using some form of conventional sign for each book (as is to be found in the work of Susato, or of Sengenwald in Jena); 20 20. For Susato, see above, note 5. Sengenwald printed in Jena during the mid- seventeenth century. He published his first music book in 1649, and another eleven appeared during the next twenty years. Several were occasional books, commemorating a local death, with the musical composition merely an appendix to a longer literary text. Others comprise the usual mix of sacred and instrumental works by local composers. the other involved different forms of the alphabetical sequence, with each book starting with some form of "A": 34. Arcadelt: III Madrigali à 4. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1539. RISM A1374=1539 23 . Copy at Venice, Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana. Quarto: [C:] A-F 4 ; [T:] a-f 4 ; [A:] AA-FF 4 ; [B:] aa-ff 4 . A number of other editions printed by Scotto in his early years follow a similar practice. An interesting example can be found in his 1540 edition of masses by Morales, Gombert and Jachet: 21 21. The data here are taken from Bernstein, Music Printing, No. 11. The book was apparently constructed so that each gathering of each partbook would contain just one mass. 35. Morales, Gombert and Jachet, Missae cum quatuor vocibus. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1540. RISM G2973=M3576=1540 4 . Quarto: [C:] A1 B-F 4 ; [T:] a 1 b-f 4 ; [A:] AA1 BB-FF 4 ; [B:] aa 1 bb-ff 4 . Note. Here, the first folio is separate from the rest of the book, and the foliation of each part runs [1] VII-XXVI. Evidently, as Bernstein argues, there was originally music for a six-folio first gathering, which was abandoned. It is reasonable to assume that the deleted music was by Morales and Gombert, who are poorly represented beside the three works of Jachet. 22 22. A similar structure appears in the companion edition of five-voiced masses by Morales and Jachet (RISM M3575 = 1540 3 ). Again, each gathering contains one mass, and the first in each book (here intact) contains six folios, including the title-page and a table of contents. Since the Tenor parts are much shorter than those of the other voices, the Tenor collation is unusual: a 6 b 4 c 2 d 4 e 2 . This pattern of roman and italic letters was employed in Scotto's house with fair consistency—and a number of exceptions—for two years, after which a different pattern, in which the Cantus used lower-case letters in italic or gothic characters (as in RISM G269=1543 4 ), was adopted alongside it. Other possibilities involved using a mix of roman and italic initials, capitals and lower case letters, or capitals of different sizes in the same signature: 36.

(Bassus A2 is signed aaaa 2; Quintus B1-2 are signed with B bbb. ) Here is one place where the musical bibliographer needs to modify the practices proposed by Bowers: his general recommendation is that, whenever letters are doubled or tripled (AA or AAA), the bibliographer should use the formulation 2A or 3A to indicate the pattern. Yet clearly such a habit cannot distinguish between the signatures of the Tenor and Altus of Example 39, or indicate the style of letters used in the volume of Villotte (Example 36). To write "2a" in Example 37 may not raise the question of whether one is referring to the Bassus or the Quintus, but to write "2A" certainly does. It seems to me that there is no choice but to spell out all the sequences as they appear in the book, and as I have done above. At the same time, and for the same reason, the collation should normally distinguish between signature letters in roman or italic or boldface, just as it does between capitals and lower-case letters. Similar patterns of change can occur in a single partbook, particularly when each book was assigned only one letter: 41. Bandiera: Psalmi Vespertini. Rome: Giacomo Fei, 1663. RISM B851. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A 8 a 4 ; [A:] B 8 b 4 ; [T:] C 8 c 4 ; [B:] D 8 d 4 ; [Organum:] E 6 e 2 . Note. We can assume that the pattern of one signature per part was already settled before typesetting began. The subsequent need for more than one gathering to a part led to the use of a different form of the same letter for the final sheet. We cannot tell whether this need was the result of a miscalculation on the part of the printer, or of the addition of more material received from the composer. Sometimes, the mix of letters and letter styles seems to be no more than a product of caprice on the part of the typesetter: 42. Mazzocchi: Sacrae Concertationes. Rome: Giacomo Fei, 1664. RISM M1678.

Not surprisingly, there are also errors in the signing of this edition: for example, the second folio of gathering B of the Tenor has the signature "Cc*2", presumably left in the forme after the Quintus was completed . Deliberate Repetition The need to distinguish the different forms of repeated letters is not the only place where following Bowers' (now traditional) procedures produces problems when handling partbooks. One of the simpler is where each partbook has exactly the same form of signatures: 43. Jachet: I Motetti à 5 con la gionta. Venice: Antonio Gardano, iv.1540. RISM J7.

This pattern was also used when some of the parts were of different lengths, sometimes (as in Example 46) reflecting the arrangement of increasing scoring in volumes: 45. Motetti C.

Quarto: [C1:] A-E 4 ; [C2:] A-C 4 D 6 ; [B:] A-B 4 C 6 ; [Organo:] A-D 4 . Clearly, in such cases, no reference can be adequately made to the content or bibliography of an individual partbook without prefacing the citation with the name or initial of the partbook involved. It is perhaps a nuisance, though nothing more, to have to do this: but a form such as "C1:C2 v " is not particularly long-winded, is essentially clear and is still easy to read. 23 23. As will appear, I believe one should use signatures to refer to virtually all features of early printed music. Foliation is often more accurate than not, but pagination patterns are regularly eccentric or incomprehensible. However, signatures are always more reliable, for printers apparently felt the need to correct signatures more often than either foliation or pagination. I have already mentioned the (largely seventeenth-century) practice of printing with large gatherings, one per partbook, and with one signature assigned to each book. As with the earlier examples given here, this is often very straightforward. But there are many instances where the principle of using one letter per partbook clashed with a desire to print in separate quarto gatherings. An amusing example of this clash between two operating principles is the following: 48. Cazzati: Messa e salmi pre li defonti . . . Opera 31. Bologna: erede di Evangelista Dozza, 1663. RISM C1626. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A-C 4 D 2 ; [A:] B-E 4 F 2 ; [T1:] C-F 4 G 2 ; [T2:] D-F 4 ; [B:] E-H 4 ; [Organo:] F-I 4 ; [Violino 1:] G 10 ; [Violino 2:] H 10 ; Ripieno: [C:] I 8 ; [A:] K 8 ; [T1:] L 8 ; [T 2 :] M 8 ; [B:] N 8 ; [Violine, o Tiorba:] O-R 4 . Here, the original intention was apparently to assign one letter to each partbook, in sequence from "A" to "O". However, any part that is over ten folios in length was printed in separate quarto gatherings: these, the principal vocal parts and the two continuo parts (Organo and Violone), were then each signed in a traditional sequential pattern. As a result, there are, for example, five gatherings signed with the letter "F". It may be that two compositors were involved, one assigned to these parts, and the other to the remainder. However, I suspect that further research on editions signed by Dozza will reveal a reluctance to have long single gatherings. More difficult to describe in a modern bibliography is the practice of retaining the same initial for all the gaterings in a partbook, but numbering the signed folios consecutively. 24 24. A brief example of this practice has already been mentioned, with Example 28. The earliest musical instances known to me are in two books of 1549, put out by Antonio Gardano. They are Buus: II Recercari ( RISM B5196), and Werrecore: La Bataglia Taliana ( RISM M1404). I have consulted the copy of the first at the British Library, and take details of both from Lewis, Antonio Gardano, vol. 1, Nos. 128 and 133. Given the practice of signing to the mid-point of each gathering (in which the second half of a gathering was not included in the count) the following signature pattern would be found in a quarto book of 16 folios: folio 1 2 3 4 gathering 1 — A2 — — gathering 2 A3 A4 — — gathering 3 A5 A6 — — gathering 4 A7 A8 — — When the gatherings are not all of the same size, as often happens, the patterns can seem even more complicated—although, in practice, they do reveal the gathering structure very quickly: 49. Cazzati: Salmi di Terza, Op. 53. Bologna: s.n., 1669. RISM C1654. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: Canto primo choro: three gatherings, of 4, 4 and 8 folios: folio 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 gathering 1 — A2 — — gathering 2 A3 A4 — — gathering 3 A5 A6 A7 A8 — — — — Note. Other parts are signed sequentially, B-I in the same manner. It is evident that the leaf signed "A3" in this example is not the third folio of the first gathering, following A2, as one would normally expect: similarly, "A4" would normally refer to the last folio of the same gathering, whereas the printer has used it to designate the sixth folio of the book. In effect, though, the printer's method is entirely logical, for "A4" represents the fourth signed leaf, but it makes a mess of all modern practice of description . 25 25. The collation of a normal book may reveal a great deal about the signature patterns , but only when all gatherings begin with an implicit number 1 in the signature. The present case, and others like it, highlight the problems that can arise when a different practice prevails. Further, the collation does not allow one to assume that a presumed signature will refer only to one folio in the book: therefore, in this as in many other musical volumes, it is not enough merely to refer to a given folio by its presumed signature, without indicating in which partbook it may be found. We have to distinguish these gatherings in the collation, and also to indicate the manner of signing: one can not merely write A 4 A 4 A 8 , for there is no way of distinguishing between the first two gatherings, and the presumption would be that each carried a signature of "A2" on the second folio: nor can one write A1 4 A3 4 A5 8 , for this implies that the third gathering is signed "A5" throughout, 26 26. One could refer to individual folios in this book by using a complex reflection of the signing patterns, in which the third gathering would open with "A5-1", "A5-2", and so on. But this in incompatible with other practices, as well as failing to represent what is found in the book. and the other gatherings similarly. I have already used the convention proposed by Bowers, following on from McKerrow, in which preceding superscripts in the collational formula indicate the repetition of a signing letter or sequence of letters. 27 27. See example 15, above. For him, a book could be described as A-Z 4 , 2 A-Q 4 (note the essential use of the comma), indicating a series of 23 gatherings signed from A to Z, followed by 16 more signed in an identical manner. For such a book, he proposed the shorthand version A- 2 Q 4 . This notation presents certain drawbacks, more apparent in music printing than elsewhere, for the implication is that all the signature letters between A and the second Q are present, a total of 39 gatherings. However, this is rare in musical editions. Let us suppose a music partbook of four gatherings in quarto, all signed with A. To write A- 4 A 4 would imply three complete alphabets of letters, followed by a fourth appearance of the signature A, a total of 70 gatherings. Similarly, to write A 4 2A 4 3A 4 4A 4 or 1-4A 4 implies gatherings signed A, AA, AAA and AAAA. The musical bibliographer would therefore have to describe the book as A 4 , 2 A 4 , 3 A 4 , 4 A 4 ; this could be abbreviated to 1-4 A 4 , even thought this does not indicate the actual signing as clearly as traditional formulae do. In cases of this sort, where this may be the most convenient formulation, the signature pattern could then be shown in a normal manner. Cazzati's book (Example 49) would be described as follows: 50. Cazzati: Salmi di Terza, Op. 53. Bolona: s.n., 1669. RISM C1654. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: Canto primo choro: 1-2 A 4 , 3 A 8 . Signatures:] A 2 [$1-2, - 1 A1, + 3 A3—4. Numbered sequentially through the gatherings, A2 signed A2; 2 A1-2 signed A3 and A4; 3 A1-4 signed A5-A8. 28 28. This book was also used as Example 33, when discussing initial gatherings without music. This may seem clumsy, but it has an advantage over all other possibilities , in being precise, and in allowing the bibliographer to understand how the book was constructed (as well as signed). In practice, musical bibliographers could perhaps adopt a short-hand, using the phrase "numbered sequentially through the part" to indicate this practice of numbering each gathering from where the previous one ended. This would save us having to indicate in detail the numbering pattern in many music books of the seventeenth century, an area of research which is fortunately not yet cluttered with other solutions. 51. Monferrato: Messe . . . Op. 19. Venice: Giuseppe Sala, 1681. RISM M3051. Copy at Paris, Bibliothèque nationale. Quarto: [C:] π 2 1-3 A 4 , 4 A 6 ; [T:] π 2 1-4 A 4 , 5 A 6 ; [A:] π 2 1-5 A 4 ; [B:] π 2 1-5 A 4 . Signatures:] A2 [$1-2, 1-3, including A1. Numbered sequentially through each partbook, from the second gathering. This phrase "numbered sequentially through each partbook" would then imply the pattern of signatures shown here: 29 29. In fact, the first signed folio in the Tenor book, 1 A1 r , is erroneously signed A3. Cantus: folio 1 2 3 4 5 6 gathering 1 — — gathering 2 A1 A2 — — gathering 3 A3 A4 — — gathering 4 A5 A6 — — gathering 5 A7 A8 A9 — — — Tenor: gathering 1 — — gathering 2 A1 A2 — — gathering 3 A3 A4 — — gathering 4 A5 A6 — — gathering 5 A7 A8 — — gathering 6 A9 A10 A11 — — — [and similarly for the other books]. The practice of repeating a signature letter throughout a book becomes a widespread manner of printing partbooks during the seventeenth century, and I have found examples in the work of Camagno, Rolla, Sala and Tradate, among others. It seems to have been particularly employed by printers who specialised in music for many parts. However, there were obviously likely to be other occasions on which it was of use. An interesting example concerns the Armonici Entusiasmi, Op. 9 of G. B. Bassani, printed by Sala in 1690 ( RISM B1186). Each part is signed in this manner, but the choice of signatures suggests a lack of communication between two craftsmen. The four parts of the solo choir are signed with A-D, as are the four of the Ripieno choir: the two violin parts are signed with I and K, and the Organ with M, evidently following a presumption that the Ripieno would be signed with E-H. The Violone (which presumably should have been signed with L) has G as its signature, perhaps assuming that the two violin parts would be signed with E and F. Perhaps one craftsman set solo A-D and I, K and M, while the other was responsible for the Ripieno A-D and G. There are rare instances in the sixteenth century, where a signature letter is repeated as a result of a change of plan or a miscalculation, 30 30. Indeed, I know of no instances from sixteenth-century Italy where the pattern of repeating signature letters can be certainly said to have been planned from the beginning: all those I have seen could plausibly be explained as the result of error, or of a change of plan. and the second gathering is signed according to the pattern of Examples 49-51. The next two examples seem to me to be cases where material was added to the volume during the process of printing. In the first, I do not believe that Gardano, with over twenty years of experience, would have failed to recognise a four-gathering collection, as opposed to a three-gathering one: 52.

Signatures:] Aij [$1-2 including *2 and **2 -all title-pages: gatherings with a repeated letter are signed with arabic numerals 3 and 4. The signature patterns described by this are illustrated here with the Tenor partbook: gathering folios: 1 2 3 4 D — Dij — — E E Eij — — F F Fij — — 2 F F3 F4 — — * * *2 53.

Gatherings with repeated letters are signed sequentially. Note. Canto 2 is not extant, but was presumably signed N-O 4 1-3 P 4 . Signature pattern in Cantus I: gathering folios: 1 2 3 4 1 — A2 — — 2 B B2 — — 3 C C2 — — 4 C3 C4 — — 5 C5 C6 — — I find it impossible to argue that the need to add two full gatherings of music at the end of each partbook, after only three signed normally, was the result of miscalculation. Instead, I assume that the music that begins at the end of the third gathering was a later addition. This comprises works for nine or more voices, while all the earlier pieces were composed for seven or eight voices. The volume is entitled Libro Primo, although no volume 2 seems to have appeared. I suspect that volume 1 was originally intended to contain only the pieces for seven or eight voices, and volume 2 would have contained the larger scorings. At a late stage in the production of the volume (after the signatures had been planned, the title-page printed, and perhaps also several other gatherings finished), these were added to the present book, possibly because there were not enough works to justify a separate title. After all, the pieces for 9-12 voices take up only a little over two gatherings. One other feature of the book's production is interesting. For Choir 2, the Alto is signed after the Basso. This allows the additional gatherings in the Alto to be signed with continuing letters, rather than with repetitions of the third letter of the book. (Much the same pattern can be found elsewhere , in, for example, Falcidio's first book of masses— RISM F68, or Asola's Missae tres—RISM A2505, both printed by Gardano's sons in 1570.) This signing pattern can also be extended to longer gatherings, each comprising more than one sheet of paper. The following example exactly follows the pattern, although the results look even more bizarre: 54. Cozzi: Messa e Salmi, Corr. Op. 1. Milan: Carlo Camagno &amp; Giorgio Rolla, 1649. RISM C4358.

The signatures in the Canto of Choir I read as follows: gathering folios: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 — — A3 A4 — — — — 2 A5 A6 A7 A8 — — — — 3 A9 A10 A11 A12 — — — — 4 A13 A14 A15 A16 — — — — This manner of describing the signing patterns does make it more clumsy to indicate errors: here, for the vocal parts it is necessary to show not only the error and its position, but also the "correct" version, since that will not always be immediately obvious to the reader. Unfortunately, the emergence of two new features mentioned here—a more lavish display of the title and dedication (involving a separate gathering and sometimes blank pages), and the retention of the same signature letter for a whole book—did not happen simply and cleanly. Thus there are many books where the patterns are not consistent, or where we can see intermediate stages in the process: 55. dal Pane: II Sagri Concerti à 2-5, Opera Terza. Rome: il Mascardi, 1675. RISM D825. Copy at Lucca, Seminario Arcivescovile. [C1:] A 20 ; [C2:] B 2 , 2 B 16 ; [A:] C 2 , 2 C 12 ; [B:] D 2 , 2 D 12 ; [Organo:] E 2 , 2 E 8 F 8 G 12 . The first two folios in all partbooks carry the same material: title-page, a blank page, a dedication, and a letter A chi vorrà servirsi deli presenti concerti , all of which could be left standing for each book, with the simple change of the part-name on the first recto. All voices except Canto Primo have a short first gathering, merely a bifolio, to carry this material: all also follow the modified signing pattern that I have been describing above, with the exception of a single error in Canto Secondo. The Canto Primo presents all the material in one gathering, but signs the folios as if in two gatherings, and following a more traditional pattern of beginning each from 1: [C1:] A, -, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, [10 unsigned] [C2:] B, -; B3, B3 [ recte B4], B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, [8 unsigned] [A:] C, -; C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, [6 unsigned] [B:] D, -; D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, [6 unsigned] [Organo:] E, -; E3, E4, E5, E6 [4 unsigned] [F and G signed normally] The following is a more complex illustration of the same point, one in which we can safely assert that two craftsmen were involved, one preparing only five partbooks, and the second preparing the other eight. I have arranged the parts to highlight the pattern: 56. Bassano: Messe Concertati, Op. 18. Bologna: Marino Silvani, 1698. RISM B1209. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bobliografico Musicale.

Signatures: [A 2 [$1-2, 1-3. -all title-pages, and F2 of Violino Secondo. Pagination: all in the first column: [i-iv], 1- all in the second column: [1-2], 3- There is no easy way to describe the signature patterns of the first of these two examples or to lay out the collational patterns of the second. Yet the details are important, and not only for the bibliographer and printing historian. The musical scholar is given clear evidence of exactly those details of presentation which (in manuscript study) are frequently indicative of differences in presentation or indeed content. Continuo Parts With the emergence of basso continuo, the continuo part was often signed last in sequence, as in Examples 9 and 10. (In this context, the placing of the organ in the sequence of signatures in Example 8 is of interest.) However, increasingly, it would be signed from A, independently of the signing of the partbooks, as in Example 54, or the following: 57. Zuchino: I Motectorum et Missarum à 4-5. Venice: Giacomo Vincenti, 1609. RISM Z361. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A 20 ; [T:] B 20 ; [A:] C 20 ; [B:] D 20 ; [5:] E 10 ; [Organo:] A 18 . 58.

Quarto: Choir I: [C:] A 22 ; [T:] B 18 ; [A:] C 20 ; [B:] D 18 ; Choir II: [C:] E 14 ; [T:] F 16 ; [A:] G 18 ; [B:] H 14 ; [ Partimento: ] A-D 4 E 6 . Sometimes this is simple to handle, for the book can be included in a general description, using the processes employed above: entries such as "A:C2 v " or "Part:C2 v " are enough to indicate which page is intended. But there are many cases where the Continuo book not only is signed with letters used elsewhere, but is also different in other ways. Perhaps it is in folio while the other parts are in quarto; perhaps it has a different treatment of the direction line; probably it has a different style of pagination; certainly it is likely to use a different manner of treating the textual incipits, the dedication, the attributions, details of scoring, and so on. Here is an example: 59. G. Belli: Salmi à 5, Op. 20. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1610. RISM B1735. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale.

Music begins on A1 v . There are enough differences in treatment that the organ part needs to be listed and discussed separately. The next example is slightly more complicated , though in fact more typical of many volumes from the seventeenth century: 60. Giacobbi: Litanei e motetti. Venice: Bartolomeo Magni, 1618.

[Parts:] Quarto: Choir I: [C:] A 10 Aa 2 ; [T:] B 10 Bb 2 ; [A:] C 10 Cc 2 ; [B:] D 10 Dd 2 ; Choir II: [C:] E 10 Ee 2 ; [T:] F 8 ; [A:] G 10 Gg 2 ; [B:] H 10 . Signatures:] $1-5, 1, -F5. Abbreviated titles on direction lines on all folios 3 r , and 5 r of the gatherings in 10. Pagination:] [i-ii], 1-. [Per l'Organo:] Folio: I 8 . Signatures:] $1-4. -A1. Abbreviated title on direction lines on all signed folios. Pagination:] [1], 3, 3, 4-. Note. This example is also interesting for suggesting that there was some miscalculation in the setting of the vocal parts. A gathering of 10 folios, such as the main gathering A of the Cantus, implies that 2½ sheets of paper were used. The remaining half sheet was used in the small gatherings, such as Aa of the Cantus. This may not waste paper, but it is clearly wasteful of effort. A similar pattern of change can occur between vocal and instrumental parts. I have already cited Cazzati's Messa e Salmi per li defonti . . . Op. 31 (Example 48) for its unusual pattern of signatures. But is also relevant here. While the principal voices and the continuo parts were all printed with normal quarto gatherings, the ripieno voice and instrumental parts were each printed in one large gathering—still in quarto format, but with more sheets to the gathering. This may be another example of work being divided between craftsmen: it is likely though that the simpler nature of the ripieno and instrumental part-writing allowed a house foreman to cast off copy more accurately. Many of Cazzati's editions from Bolognese presses (not least those where no printer is named) contain bibliographical anomalies of one sort or another . While some may reflect differing patterns of behaviour within the printing shops, others suggest that Cazzati's music was not always provided in a straightforward or timely manner, resulting in changes and problems in planning the printing of the edition. This lends some credence to the idea that Cazzati was himself sponsoring many of these editions, and arranging for their printing. Anomalous Signings While several gatherings can have the same signature, the reverse can also happen, or at least appear to happen, with two sets of signatures in one gathering. One example, not very confusing, has already been mentioned, with the signing of the Cantus Primus in Example 55. A very similar pattern appears in another Roman edition: 61. Alias Cantiones sacras à 3, ed. Sylvestris. Rome: Michele Cortellini, 1655. RISM 1655 1 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. [A:] a 20 ; [T:] b 20 ; [B:] c 20 ; [Organum:] d 20 . Signatures: the same pattern in all books:] —, a2, A, A2, A3-A8, [10 unsigned folios]. Given the signatures, one would expect the book to be constructed as a 2 A 18 . However, it is clearly one continuous gathering of ten bifolios. There are few plausible reasons why a single gathering should follow this pattern. One, and the best, may be simply that the first bifolium, containing only preliminary matter, was originally to have been a free-standing bifolium. In this case, it may have been incorporated into the gathering so that it could be conjugate with added folios at the back. This is to some extent supported by the contents as listed at the end of the volume. After fourteen compositions ascribed to various Roman composers, which end on the verso of folio 18, there is added a setting of Quem vidistis pastores, which is ascribed as a Melos Rusticum. If Sylvestris had wanted to end with the previous piece, the printer would have been left with no room for a table of contents . It seems possible therefore that the original preliminary bifolium was converted at this stage into four folios, wrapped around the rest, initially to contain the table. As a result, Sylvestris added one more piece, this one anomalous in that it is not collected Ab Excellentissimis Musices Auctoribus, as the title-page says (with headlines naming the composers), but is anonymous . There are other problems with signatures and signing patterns, not all of them related to the collation. It is notable how many of the following instances, and also how many of the earlier problem cases, come from printers working in Rome. Some printers signed each sheet, rather than each folio, in the first half of each gathering. In these cases, the gathering structure, and hence the collation is likely to be straightforward: 62. Cifra: VI Madrigali à 5. Rome: Luc' Antonio Soldi, 1623. RISM C2225. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C1:] A 12 ; [C2:] B 12 ; [A:] C 14 ; [T:] D 12 ; [B:] E 10 ; [Basso per L'Istromenti:] F 8 . Gatherings Signatures [C1:] — A1 A2 — A3 — [6 unsigned folios] [C2:] — B2 B3 B3 B4 B5 [6 unsigned folios] [A:] — C2 C2 — C3 — C4 [7 unsigned folios] [T:] — — D2 — D3 — [6 unsigned folios] [B:] — E2 E2 — E2 [5 unsigned folios] [Basso (Continuo):] — F1 F2 F2 [4 unsigned folios] Here, the plan was apparently to sign each partbook with the same letter, and number each sheet consecutively. This pattern was not followed very successfully although the intention is clear. The only completely systematic part is the Canto Primo: the Tenore and the Continuo books are correct, although the actual signing is anomalous, while the other three books contain errors. The evidence is as if the compositor was more used to signing folios and kept forgetting that he had been instructed to sign each sheet only once. If this example showed signing by sheets with the same signature letter in each gathering, another Roman, Paolo Masotti, could occasionally sign by the sheet, and give each sheet a different letter, even when two or more were in the same gathering: 63. Arcadelt: Madrigali a quattro . . . corretto . . . Da Claudio Monteverde. Rome: Paolo Masotti, 1627. RISM A1362 = 1627 7 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale . Quarto: Canto: [I] 16 ; Alto: [II] 16 ; Tenore: [III] 16 ; Basso: [IV] 16 . Signatures: folios: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Canto — A2 B B2 C C2 D D2 [8 unsigned folios] Alto — E2 F F[2] G G2 H H2 [8 unsigned folios] Tenore — J2 K K2 L L2 M M2 [8 unsigned folios] Basso — N2 O O2 P P2 Q Q2 [8 unsigned folios] There are problems here with creating a collational formula, and also with referring to individual folios. The collation probably has to be written with editorial symbols for each gathering (as I have done). It would not be possible to describe the Canto as A-D 16 , for that would imply four large gatherings. The only viable alternative is to call the Canto A 16 (signed A-D), the Tenor E 16 (signed E-H), etc., which is itself clumsy. It seems clearer to give a separate list of signings and as simple as possible a collation line, using editorial collational signs (here roman numerals). In the same way, there is no easy way to use the signature letters to refer to individual folios: the fourth folio is part of the sheet B (B2), and so are the thirteenth and fourteenth (which are actually B3 and B4), while the fifteenth is part of A (A3)! Again, the editorial signing (the roman numerals) allows one to cite folios correctly, with or without adding the signatures found on the page. In effect the book is best treated as though it were unsigned. Books like this provide an exception to my suggestion (presented below) that signatures, rather than pagination, should normally be used for citation. Fortunately, it is also one where the pagination is correct throughout. Faulty Signings Frequently a printer did not sign a folio or two which would normally have been signed. In most cases, especially when the title-page is involved, he allowed for it in his numbering system, for this was important for his own methodology as much as for the binder. Then, the modern scholar can assign the number editorially, in the customary manner. Sometimes, however , the folio is not allowed for in the sequence of numbers, and here one has to examine the source more carefully. 64. Cazzati: Il terzo libro de motetti a voce sola . . . Opera Decima terza. Venice: Alessandro Vincenti, 1651. RISM C1594. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. 31 31. This copy has been published in facsimile in Solo Motets from the Seventeenth Century: Facsimiles of Prints from the Italian Baroque, vol. 6, ed. Anne Schnoebelen (New York: Garland, 1988). One volume in portrait quarto: A-C 16 . Signatures:] A 2 [$1-8, -A1, A2. A3-8 are signed A2-A7. A1 r contains a title, A1 v is blank, A2 r contains the dedication, and the music begins on A2 v . There are several possible explanations for this signing pattern. One is that the printer originally intended the first bifolio to be separate, but found that he had more music than would fit into the resulting smaller volume. The first bifolio was then converted into two bifolios wrapped around the rest of the book. 32 32. This is not the only example of this practice: in 1567, Antonio Barrè printed the third book Delle Muse à 4. Madrigali ariosi ( RISM 15627), for which three partbooks survive. For each part, a single bifolio is wrapped around three quarto gatherings, A-C. The bifolio contains the title-page, a dedication, the privilege, and a contents list, each taking one page: each partbook shows the same setting of all pages, with the simple change of the name of the voice-part. According to Mauren Buja, Antonio Barrè and Music Printing in Mid-Sixteenth Century Rome (Ph.D. dissertation, Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 1996), 349-358, from whence these details are taken, the bifolio is signed on both rectos, A1 and C5: the normal gathering A is signed A2 and A3, B is signed normally, and the four leaves of C are signed C1-C4. The contents give no reason for this pattern, other than the ease of printing the complete run of the wrap-around bifolio apart from the musical content. An alternative, and more probable, suggestion is that the music was always intended to start on A1 v , so that the present folio signed A2 would indeed be the second of the book. The decision to insert the Dedicatory folio would then have been made after typesetting began, but presumably before reaching the 8th folio of music. Fairly often, however, the "extra" folio is not matched by a conjugate in the other half of the gathering, and is truly surplus. This folio may then have been tipped in: 65. Donati: Il secondo libro delle messe da capella . . . Op. 12. Venice: Alessandro Vincenti, 1633. RISM D3400. Copy at Milan, Capitolo Metropolitano. Quarto: [C:] A 26 (A1 +1); [T:] B 26 (B1 +1); [A:] C 26 Cc 2 ; [B:] D 24 ; [5:] E 12 ; [BC:] F 20 . Note. The inserted folios after the first in the Cantus and Tenor carry the list of names of all the dedicatees. It is not clear whether the other partbooks also originally contained this tipped-in leaf. There is another possible solution, especially during the seventeenth century. When the unsigned, extra sheet is a title-page or a half-title, one should suspect the loss of a blank first leaf: the original may have followed the pattern of Example 33, above. More extreme is the practice of publishing a title without any signatures at all. For books like this, Bowers 33 33. Bowers, Principles, pp. 213-219. argues for the use of a greek pi or chi for all unsigned gatherings: and I have used pi regularly in earlier examples. Normally, of course, he is assuming that the unsigned gatherings are part of a book which also contains signatures. There are cases, however, such as the following, where each partbook is completely unsigned. It seems more sensible to assign editorial collational signatures, using either letters or roman numerals within brackets: 66. Capello: Lamentationi, Benedictus . . . Op. 3. Verona: Angelo Tamo, 1612. RISM C903. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: Choir I: C, [I] 6 ; T, [II] 6 ; A, [III] 6 ; B, [IV] 6 . Choir II: Violetta, [V] 4 ; Viola, [VI] 4 ; Viola [2], [VII] 4 ; Violone, [VIII] 4 . Choir III: Chitaroni, [IX] 4 . Folio: Partitura: [X] 6 [XI] 8 . This also avoids a further complication in formulation if Bowers' formulae were followed: the Continuo part would have been described as π 6 π 8 . While Bowers suggests the use of arabic numerals for sequential unsigned gatherings, this seems unsatisfactory for music editions, where arabic numerals are on occasion used for the signatures themselves. Finally, all printers may at times make errors or produce structures and signing patterns which are certainly erroneous. In some cases, the signatures are clearly correctable, and probably indicate something of the procedures in the printing shop. The book of Messa e Salmi, Corr. Op. 1 by Cozzi published in 1649 (Example 54) has a clear indication that the Tenor book was prepared after the Altus: two folios in the Tenor book, C5 and C13 (that is, at the beginning of the 2nd and 4th gatherings) are actually signed B5 and B13. In the case of Has quatuor missas (Example 8), there are three wrong signings in gathering B, the Altus book: the three folios B3-5 are all signed with the letter A, and corrected in manuscript (in the same hand) in both the Bologna and Lucca copies. This must surely imply that these two sheets were prepared after those of the Cantus part, and presumably placed in the same formes. In the same way, the first three folios of the Bassus of the Quatto Libri delle Villotte (Example 26) are signed with the signature from the Tenor book. There is a surprisingly large number of such errors, many of which are most easily explained as representing the retention of a signature in a forme during the insertion of material from a different gathering. However, we can not make this assumption as a matter of course. There are occasions when it raises impossible solutions: 67. Bianchi: Motetti e Messe à 8. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1611. RISM B2497. Copy at Lucca, Seminario Arcivescovile. Quarto: Choir I: [C:] A 12 ; [T:] B 12 ; [A:] C 12 ; [B:] D 12 ; Choir II: [C:] E 12 ; [T:] F 12 ; [A:] G 12 ; [B:] H 12 ; [ Basso Continuo : ] I 12 . Signing errors: C5 signed E5 (corrected in ms.), C6 signed E5; D6 signed G6; E5 and 6 signed B5 and B6; F5 and 6 signed D5 and D6; G5 and 6 signed F5 and F6. It is wishful thinking to propose a sequence of preparing the partbooks on the assumption that so many signatures were erroneously retained in the forme. Such an interpretation suggests that gathering B was prepared before E, and that before C; also that gathering D was earlier than F, itself earlier than G. But then G appears to be earlier than D, and both propositions are clearly not tenable. 68. Bernardi: II Madrigaletti à 2-3, Op. 12. Venice: Alessandro Vincenti, 1621. RISM B2069. Copy at Vienna: Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek. Quarto: [C1:] A 18 ; [C2:] B 18 ; [B:] C 4 ; [Basso Continuo:] D 16 . Note. The signatures on A9 and B9 are exchanged, though the music continues correctly. This seems a relatively simple error: the most likely explanation is that the two half-sheets (A9-10 and B9-10) were set up in the same forme. Indeed most signing errors seem to be explicable through an understanding of printing-house procedures. But there are some printers, among them Soldi, who seem more prone to nonsensical patterns: 69. Tarditi: Psalmi Magnificat à 8, Lib. II. Rome: Luc' Antonio Soldi, 1620. RISM T225. Copy at Piacenza, Biblioteca e Archivio Capitolare.

      <field name="fulltext">II. Pagination and Piece Numbering The signature pattern has implications for unsigned sheets in ordinary gatherings, whereby bibliographers can refer to the second half of a gathering in terms of its "signature". This has produced a simple and easy means, even in most of the books discussed above, for referring to any folio or page in a printed book. Even if a book, such as that in Example 1, is only signed to the second folio in every gathering, a reference to E4 r is clear. However, the second means of referring to each page, a sequence of page numbers, is unfortunately often less reliable than the folio numbers. One reason is that page numbers do not refer in any way to the physical structure of the book, as folio numbers do (or should do). As a result, there is little need for any consistent pattern, or for any real attempt at accuracy. The numbers are unlikely to be used by the compositor or pressman to check for accurate imposition in the forme, nor are they likely to be useful to the binder (especially since many will be hidden within folds of the paper before it is trimmed). The result is not only that pagination patterns could often be erroneous and the printer feel no need to correct them, but also that a number of different patterns for numbering (not always by pages) could co-exist, even in one printing shop, sometimes in one volume. Among them are the following: (i) Pagination from the beginning of the musical content, beginning with number 1, often on folio 2 r . This follows normal book-printing practice, in which the preliminary matter lay on pages without numbers, or with a different sequence of numbers: 70. Sponga/Usper: Messe e Salmi. Venice: Giovanni Vincenti, 1614. RISM U116 and 1614 2 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Folio: [C:] A 12 ; [T:] B 14 ; [A:] C 10 ; [B:] D 10 ; [5:] E 16 ; [6:] F 4 .

Quarto: π 4 A-Q 4 R 6 . Pagination:] [i-viii], 1-124, 123-135 [ recte 125-137], [138-140]. Note. Here the whole first gathering is occupied with preliminary material , and the musical text begins with the page numbered 1, on A1 r . (ii) Pagination from the start of the musical content, but numbered as if earlier pages were numbered: this could involve starting on folio 2 r with the number 3, or on 2 v with a number 4: 72.

(iii) Pagination from the start of the content, but implying a page number 1 somewhere other than on 1 r or 2 r . A compositor accustomed to paginating from 2 r with number 3 might well assign that number to 2 v if an extra page of preliminary material were required: 74. Banchieri: Il metamorfosi musicale, IV canzonette à 3. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1606. RISM B826. Copy at Augsburg, Staats- und Stadtbibliothek. Quarto: [C1:] A 16 B 2 ; [C2:] C 16 D 2 ; [B:] E 16 F 2 . Signatures:] C 2 [$1-8, 1. A3 signed A 2; C3 signed C 2; E2 signed C 2; E3 signed E 2. Pagination, in all books:] [i, 1-3], 4-18, [19], 20-22, [23], 24-. Note. Here is another instance where the signing pattern implies that signatures were kept in the forme: the erroneous number on A3 is retained into C. The attempt at correcting the error in gathering E made the situation worse. (iv) Different pagination patterns in different partbooks, depending on the presence or absence of a dedication or other preliminary matter. This is particularly prevalent when there are organ books, often paginated according to a different pattern (see Examples 59 and 60). 75. Arcadelt: III madrigali à 4. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1539. RISM A1374-5=1539 23 =1556 23 . Copy at Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek . The collation for this copy is given at Example 34. Pagination: Canto:] [i-ii], I-XXXXV, [46]; other voices:] [i], I-XXXXV, [46, 47]. Note. The Cantus part has a Dedicatory letter on folio 1 v . 76. Cazzati: Antifone, e letanie concertata, Op. 32.

Pagination: for gatherings A-E:] [1-3], 4-; for gatherings F,M,O:] [1-2], 3-; for gatherings G-K,N:] [1], 2-. (v) Piece numbering: this is already found before 1520, for example in Petrucci's Motetti de la Corona Libro II of 1519. It is most easily detected in books where the number of voices increases in later compositions, but the additional voices are printed in the same few partbooks. This results in some books having two voice-parts for the same piece on an opening, and the same number at the head of each page. A well-known example is the I Musica de diversi auttori à 7-12 (Venice: Giacomo Vincenti &amp; Ricciardo Amadino, 1584: RISM 1584 4 ). But other books, with consistent scoring, also have piece numbering: they include works from a wide range of printers. In some cases, it can seem to be indistinguishable from pagination, given the possibility (common with villanellas, madrigals and much late sixteenth-century music) of making each piece or pars fit onto one page. Then the index page, as well as the preliminary pages, will be unnumbered. Possibly such a pattern should be called piece numbering if it begins with the number 1 (regardless of the page involved) and does not number the page of contents at the end of the part; it also has to be consistent for all partbooks. There are also instances where the first piece begins on 2 r , but, in some partbooks, the first lines of music are already printed low on the second page (1 v ). In these cases, there may be an additional number "1" before the music on 1 v , indicating that the numerals were intended to be piece numbers, at least at this stage of the book: 77. Il Trionfo di Dori à 6. Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1592. RISM 1592 11 . Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto. [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:[ I-M 4 ; [B:] N-Q 4 ; [5:] R-V 4 ; [6:] X-Z 4 Aa 4 . Pagination begins [i-ii], 1-. An additional numeral "1" appears low on N1 v and X1 v , above the opening of the first piece. (vi) Piece numbering which turns into pagination towards the end of many volumes, as longer pieces or those with more voices take up more than one page. The pattern of inserting a number on each page can continue to the end of the book. I believe this should normally be called pagination throughout, unless there is some strong indication otherwise: 78. Tiburtino: Fantase et recerchari à 3. Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1549. RISM T774=1549 34 . Copy at London, British Library. Quarto: [C:] F-K 4 ; [T:] L-P 4 ; [B:] A-E 4 . Piece numbering, 1-13, for the first 13 items, which then turns into pagination , XIIII-XXV, for the next 8, and again into piece numbering, XXVI-XXXIII, for the last 8. Note. Bernstein notes 35 35. Bernstein, Music Printing, p. 404. that the sequence of arabic numerals changes to roman capitals at the change from instrumental pieces by Tiburtino to a sequence of madrigals. However, she does not detect that the pattern changes from piece numbering to page numbering, nor that it changes back again, at another change of repertoire, now involving ricercars by Willaert. The first change can be deduced from the evidence in her list of contents: and the second was in effect made necessary by the repertoire. Willaert's pieces are only identified by number, for there is no distinctive heading to the relevant pages. Piece numbering was probably more useful for the Tiburtino pieces, too, for they are otherwise identified by the solmisation syllables of their opening, which means that the first piece has a different "title" in the different parts. Significantly, the Bassus changes to roman numerals with piece number 10 (on B1 r ), suggesting that this change was at least partly the result of a compositor's decision. (vii) Pagination which turns into piece numbers. Numbering can begin with any of the patterns already mentioned, and continue systematically as pagination, assigning new numbers to different partes if they are on different pages, but then break down as these large-scale pieces appear at the end of a volume: 79. Gastoldi: Sacre lodi a diversi santi à 5. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1587. RISM G480. Copy at Gdansk, Biblioteka Gdaŉska Oilskiej Akademii Nauk. Quarto: [C:] A-B 4 C 6 ; [T:] D-E 4 F 8 ; [A:] G-H 4 J 6 ; [B:] K-M 4 ; [5:] N-O 4 P 6 . Each part opens with a title-page and a Dedication on the first verso. Neither is paginated, so that number 1 appears on the second recto. Numbering proceeds normally to page number 15, even though some pieces have taken more than one page: in other words, this is true pagination. However , starting at the end of the second gathering, the volume concludes with a large-scale nine-section Canzone à S. Francesco, texted "Sacrati horrori ove la folta chioma". As is normal, some sections are reduced scoring, and other take two pages. At this point, what had been page numbering becomes piece numbering, as shown below. As a result, the contents list does not need to be re-set for each partbook: Piece Pars Canto Tenore Alto Basso Quinto 1 A2 r 1 D2 r 1 G2 r 1 K2 r 1 N2 r 1 2 A2 v 2 D2 v 2 G2 v 2 K2 v 2 N2 v 2 A3 r 3 D3 r 3 G3 r 3 K3 r 3 N3 r 3 3 A4 r 4 D4 r 4 G4 r 4 K4 r 4 N4 r 4 12 1 B4 v 14 E4 v 14 H4 v 14 L4 v 14 O4 v 14 2 C1 r 15 F1 r 15 I1 r 15 M1 r 15 P1 r 15 3 C1 v 16 F1 v 16 I1 v 16 M1 v 16 P1 v 16 C2 r 16 F2 r 16 I2 r 16 M2 r 17 P2 r 16 4 — F2 v 17 I2 v 17 M2 v 18 P2 v 17 F3 r 17 I3 r 17 P3 r 17 5 C2 v 18 F3 v 18 — — P3 v 18 C3 r 18 F4 r 18 P4 r 19 6 C3 v 19 F4 v 19 I3 v 18 M3 r 19 — C4 r 19 F5 r 19 I4 r 19 7 C4 v 20 F5 v 20 I4 v 20 M3 v 20 P4 v 20 C5 r 20 F6 r 20 I5 r 20 P5 r 20 8 C5 v 21 F6 v 21 I5 v 21 M4 r 21 P5 v 21 F7 r 21 9 C6 r 22 F7 v 22 I6 r 22 M4 v 22 P6 r 22 F8 r 22 Tavola C6 v [23] F8 v [23] I6 v [23] M4 v [22] P6 v [23] This evidently sets out to number the pieces—in this case, sections of a larger work—consistently throughout the five partbooks. The two anomalies (Bassus M2 v , and Quintus P4 r ) do not destroy the larger pattern, and are themselves easily explained as temporary reversions to pagination, Amadino's more normal practice as this time. 80.

This copy is reproduced as Edizione Anastatica delle fonti Palestriniane: Prima Serie, vol 2, ed. Giuliana Gialdroni (Palestrina: Fondazione Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina , 1989), pp. 151-181. This volume reproduces other editions of the same Palestrina book, and demonstrates some of the different procedures being discussed here. Quarto: [C:] A-D 4 ; [T:] E-H 4 ; [A:] I-M 4 ; [B:] N-Q 4 . Pagination in all books: [1], 2-30, [31-32]: except that p. 14 of the Altus [O2v] is numbered 12, and 31 of the Cantus [D4r] is numbered 30. Note. The additional number "30" at the end of the Cantus is over the additional fifth voice of the last madrigal, the sixth pars of Ecco oscurate i chiari raggi. In essence, therefore, this is not a page number, but a piece number. However, numbering begins (at least notionally) with the title-page, and so sets out as pagination. 81. Taroni: II madrigali à 5. Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1612. RISM T229. Copy in private possession. [C:] A 12 . Signatures:] A 2 [$1-6, including the title-page. Pagination:] [i, ii], 1-18, 18, 20, 17, [22]. Note. Here the volume ends with two eight-voiced pieces, for each of which the Canto partbook carries the music for Canto Primo and Tenore primo, on facing pages. The two numbers "18" are for the first of these, and the numbers "20" and "17" the second. The "17" (on 12 r ) was an error for "20", and presumably retained in the forme from 10 r . This numbering sequence is strictly piece numbering, but looks in the early stages as if it might be pagination. (viii) Numbering which is based on the numbers appearing in a different partbook. Thus if the Cantus has pagination, the Altus or Bassus may assign the same numbers to the same pieces, regardless of the number of pages they take. This is likely to be most obvious in those volumes which contain pieces in a steadily increasing number of voices or where two voices are sometimes entered in the same partbook. In practice, it is most commonly found with piece numbering: 82. Rota: I Missarum à 4-6. Venice: Angelo Gardano, 1595. RISM R2784. Copy at Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. Quarto: [C:] A-E 4 ; [T:] F-K 4 ; [A:] L-P 4 ; [B:] Q-V 4 ; [5:] X-Y 4 Z 6 ; [6:] Aa-Bb 4 . Piece numbering from 1: the Quintus starts with No. 13 and the Sextus with No. 25. 83. I Canzon di diversi per sonar à 4-6. Venice: Giacomo Vincenti, 1588. RISM 1588 31 . Copy at Basel, Öffentliche Bibliothek der Universität Basel. Quarto: [C:] A-B 4 ; [T:] C-D 4 ; [A:] E-F 4 ; [B:] G-H 4 ; [5:] K 6 ; [6:] L 4 . Piece numbering: since each piece occupies just one page, these can act as page numbers: [C,T,A,B:] [i-ii], 1-13, [14]; [5:] [i-ii], 5, 8 [ recte 6], 7-10, 13 [ recte 11] 12-13 [14]; [6:] [i-ii], 11-13, 4 [ recte 14], [iii-iv]. (ix) There are also still cases of foliation, rather than pagination, usually in books that are in folio format and where the music is laid out choirbook style. Examples include Palestrina: Missarum Liber Primus (Rome: Valerio &amp; Luigi Dorico, 1554) and Lambardi: Antiphonarium Vespertina, Seconda pars (Venice: Cenobio Sancto Spirito, 1597: RISM L366). Among examples which are not in folio format can be cited the so-called "Cancionero de Uppsala", Villancicos De diversos Autores (Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1556: RISM 1556 30 ), 37 37. This has been published in facsimile from the copy at Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket (Peer: Alamire, c. 1984). and Il Lauro Secco (Ferrara: Baldini, Vittorio 1582). Some keyboard and lute books are also foliated, among them Valente's Intavolatura (Napoli: Giuseppe Cacchio dall'Aquila, 1576: RISM V33). Some seventeenth-century books of solo song, usually in a long landscape format, continue to be foliated. A late example is not truly representative , in that it is only printed, from engraved plates, on the recto of each folio: Roncalli: Capricci Armonici, Op. 1 (Bergamo: Sebastian Casetti, 1692: RISM R2447). But the practice was never so common in Italy as it was north of the Alps. (x) In addition, of course, there can be confused situations, just as there are of signatures, in which different books follow different patterns. I have already cited the case of Bassano's Op. 18 (Example 56), and another from his output follows, interesting because the pagination patterns follow those of different gathering structures and signatures: 84. Bassani: Salmi concertati à 3-5, Op. 21. Bologna: Marino Silvani, 1699. RISM B1213. Copy at Zurich, Zentralbibliothek. Quarto: [C1:] π 2 A-E 4 [C2]: A-D 4 [T:] π 2 A-C 4 [A:] A-C 4 D 6 [B:] π 2 A-C 4 D 6 Ripieno: [C1:] A 4 B 6 [etc.] Pagination: [C1:] [i-iv], 1-39, [40] [C2:] [1-2], 3-32 [T:] [i-iv], 1-22, [23-24] [A:] [1-2], 3-34, [35-36] [B:] [i-iv], 1-35, [36] Ripieno: [C1:] [1-2], 3-20 [etc.] Note. There is no evident reason for the two different collation and pagination patterns. All partbooks print the title-page and dedication on the first two folios, and start the music on 3 r . Nor is the presence or absence of an initial unsigned bifolium contingent on finishing the rest of the part without an extended last gathering, as the Altus and Bassus indicate. We are again reduced to speculating about the involvement of two compositors with different practices. The generally difficult nature of numbering patterns, not to mention their frequent inconsistencies, argues strongly against using pagination or piece numbering as a basic manner of referring to bibliographical aspects of a book. Piece numbering may well be the most easy way of referring to the musical content, but it obviously cannot be used to describe the structure or placing of (for example) watermarks. In those cases (common with Gardano and Scotto) where more than two pieces lie on an opening, or in those others (common around the turn of the seventeenth century) where one piece number applies to two or three pages, such numbers become valueless. Apart from all these situations, however, there is another reason why page numbers are not a reliable means of reference. During much of the seventeenth century they are probably the least accurate part of a printed volume of music. It is possible, of course, to say at the outset of a description that the modern writer is "using corrected page numbers" and to proceed entirely consistently. In such a situation, the description will already have cited the actual pagination, and given the corrected versions against any errors: 85. Musica de'virtuosi della Florida I.

The evidence suggests a particular sequence of preparing the books: the Tenor was printed immediately after the Canto (hence the wrong signature), followed by the Basso: the Alto was probably next, and the Quinto last. In addition, we can propose that the inner forme of the second gathering, which would contain the page number "14", was printed before the outer, and that some form of vertical setting was practised. 86.

In a case like this, omitted numbers can be safely inferred, and there are so few actual errors that they can be corrected in the description, and the correct ones used elsewhere. With so few errors, the process of reading the description and correlating it with a copy is not hampered by this style of treatment of errors: and the same is true of a number of my earlier examples. But these are all simple examples, with few and obvious errors. In other cases, although there may be more errors, they are worth entering, and even discussing, because they throw light on the printing patterns or because they show a remarkable consistency: 87. Massone: I Motetti à 2-3. Napoli: Ottavio Beltrano, 1638. RISM M1325. Copy at Naples, Biblioteca Oratoriana dei Geroslamini. [Parte 1:] A-D 4 ; [Parte 2:] F-K 4 ; [Parte 3:] a-b 4 ; [Partimento:] A-D 4 . Signatures:] A 2 [$1-2, —all titles, and a2. 1:B2 signed b2; Partimento B2 signed M2. Pagination:] [1-2], 3-. In Parte 1 pages 25 and 29 are numbered 27 and 31. Parte 2 is paginated:] [1-2], 3-16, 19, 18, 19, 18, 23, 22, 23, 22, 25-37, [38]. In the partimento pages 12 and 13 are numbered 4 and 5. Note. In each of these parts, the mis-pagination was a result of mistakes during imposition. In the Partimento, two page numbers in the first gathering were left unchanged in the second, though the other six page numbers were new: the two lay on the same side of the same forme. Similarly in the Parte 1, two numbers were left unchanged when the inner forme of gathering C was broken up and the outer forme inserted. This is also the explanation for the pattern of page numbers in Parte 2, where all the page numbers of the inner forme were retained for the outer. Incidentally, this evidence provides an argument for setting type continuously through the part, rather than casting off in advance and setting by formes. These are still fairly straightforward cases. Unfortunately, however, there are many other cases where the typesetter has made nonsense of a logical sequence of numbering. Again, it is possible to list all the numbers and to give the numbers that should have been used, and then continue with the "corrected page numbers". However, the list can become so complex that the reader has trouble using it, especially since few of the numbers will correspond to those before him in the source. In these cases it is better not to use page numbers for any references to the content. The following examples should make this point clear: 88. Tudino: Magnificat à 8. Venice: Giacomo Vincenti, 1590. RISM T1337. Copy at Kassel, Landesbibliothek und Murharsche Bibliothek. Quarto: [C:] A 10 ; [T:] B 10 ; [A:] C 10 ; [B:] D 10 . Signatures:] B3 [$1-5, —A1, D1; —all second folios. Paginated as follows: [C:] [i-iii], 4, 3, 6-7, 6-7, 10-11, 10-11, 14-15, 14, 17, [18-19], 20. [T:] [i-ii], 1, 4, 3-7, 10-11, 7, 11, 14-15, 12, 17, [iii-iv], 20 [A:] [i-iii], 4, 3, 4, 3, 7, 9-11, 11-12, 12, 11, [iv], 17, [v-vi], 20. [B:] [i-iii], 4, 3, 6-7, 7, 7, 10-11, 10-13, [iv], 17, [v-vi], 20. Analysis of the pagination shows that two different patterns were in operation. In one (pattern a, below), pagination begins with the title-page, thought not actually entered until a later page; in the other (pattern b), it is presumed to start with 2 r , athough the first indication may again not be until later: Sheet I 1 r 2 v 9 r 10 v 1 v 2 r 9 v 10 r A — 4 17 20 A — — — — B — 4 17 20 B — 1 — — C — 4 17 20 C — — — — D — 4 17 20 D — — — — Pattern a [ 1 ] 4 17 20 Pattern a [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 18 19 Pattern b — 2 15 18 Pattern b — 1 16 17 Sheet II 3 r 4 v 7 r 8 v 3 v 4 r 7 v 8 r A 3 6 11 14 A 6 7 14 15 B 3 6 11 12 B 4 5 14 15 C 3 7 12 — C 4 3 12 11 D 3 7 11 — D 6 7 12 13 Pattern a 5 8 13 16 Pattern a 6 7 14 15 Pattern b 3 6 11 14 Pattern b 4 5 12 13 Half-Sheet III 5 r 6 v 5 v 6 r A 7 10 A 10 11 B 7 7 B 10 11 C 9 11 C 10 11 D 7 10 D 10 11 Pattern a 9 12 Pattern a 10 11 Pattern b 7 10 Pattern b 8 9 The problem is typified by the two half-formes that comprise the innermost half sheet, III. While the inner forme follows pattern a, the outer seems to follow pattern b. The outer forme of the outermost sheet, I, follows pattern a consistently, while the only number on the inner forme represents pattern b. Finally, the second sheet has no clear pattern at all, for while the tendency to pattern b on the outer forme is clear, the inner is far less clear. No single partbook shows a consistent pattern of following one pattern rather than the other: indeed one forme of both Tenor and Bassus seems to change pattern in mid-forme. It is implausible that any one partbook was set up straight through, without pauses or change of compositor. Whether this means two compositors, or one who changed his habits, I cannot say. However, it is clear that any reference to "page 7", "page 11", or "page 18" will raise doubts in the mind of any reader. 89. Strozzi: Sacri Concentus II.

By laying out the pagination like this, traces can be discerned of the manner in which some of the errors were engendered: but the arrangement is of most use in keeping a reader oriented with the list of contents and any other analytical commentary. 38 38. The distinction between those editorial page numbers which are given as if in sequence, [85-86] for example, and those which are truly editorial, such as [vi], is a useful one. In the former, we are assuming that the number was merely omitted but borne in mind by the compositor, an assumption which can be made because the numbers continue in order after the omission. In the latter, it is not possible to assign a number to the omission, for the sequence does not continue in correct order. The editorial roman numeral, customarily given to the page, is useful for drawing attention to what may be a significant feature of the preparation of the book. 90.

As I show, it is possible to make sense of the numbering in two parts (Cantus and Organo), although there is no point in trying to list the correct numberings for the Altus. Further, while the reader would have problems in trying to relate the corrected numbers of the Altus part to a copy in hand, there is also no benefit to be had from referring to the printed numerals, especially in the case of 22 and 29! 91.

Here, the difficulty lies not so much in interpreting the sequence, but rather in explaining the absence of so many numerals. Such cases may seem extreme, although they could be multiplied many times. However, even when the numbering seems logical and relatively consistent , we can not always be sure what it stands for: the difference between piece numbering and pagination is not always clear, the significance of the different patterns of pagination is not yet understood, and the apparent anomalies are as often the result of a change of plan as they are of compositor's error. Since the numbering was not needed by either compositor or binder, but was inserted as a convenience to the user, its accuracy was seldom a matter of concern. While erroneous signatures can often be seen to have been corrected in the printer's shop, this is much less frequently the case with pagination errors. For these reasons, it seems more logical to use for analytical purposes the numbering which was needed by both printer and binder, and which therefore was more likely to be accurate: that is the pattern of signature numbers. These patterns can be quite varied, but they are more closely followed in a majority of books.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">by Conor Fahy * * I am deeply grateful to Richard Hills and Brian Luker, fellow members of the British Association of Paper Historians, for making their technical expertise available to me, to Laura and Giulio Lepschy for help with the translation of Peri's text, and to Anna Giulia Cavagna, Fiorenzo Toso and Paolo Cevini, who offered suggestions on the interpretation of technical terms in Peri's text. Naturally the responsibility for the contents of this article is entirely mine. The material it contains was first presented as part of the Sandars Lecture in Bibliography given at the University of Cambridge on 6 March 2002.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE purpose of this article is to present to English-speaking readers a substantial seventeenth-century account of the buildings and workings of a Genoese white-paper mill, which seems to be unknown to paper historians outside Italy. 1 1. And not very well known inside Italy, either. The only modern edition is in Manlio Calegari, `La cartiera genovese tra Cinquecento e Seicento', Quaderni del Centro di studio sulla storia della tecnica del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, 12 (1984), a publication difficult to come by even in Italy. Peri's account is extensively drawn on in two recent books, Calegari's La manifattura genovese della carta (sec. XVI-XVIII) (Genoa: ECIG, 1986) and Paolo Cevini, Edifici da carta genovesi (Secoli XVI-XIX) (Genoa: SAGEP, 1995). The account is significant for three reasons: the importance of Genoa as a paper-making centre in early modern Europe, the author's access to local knowledge, and the date of the text, which makes it, as far as I know, the earliest description in any detail of a European paper-mill and of the relevant manufacturing processes, preceding by seventy-five years the account in Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728) and by more than a century the authoritative and much more detailed treatments of the subject in Joseph Jérôme de Lalande's L'art de faire le papier (1761) and in the article "Papeterie" by Louis Jacques Goussier in vol. XI (1765) of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and d'Alembert. 2 2. See Joseph Jérôme de Lalande, `Art de faire le papier', in Académie des Sciences, Descriptions des arts et métiers, faites ou approuvées par Messieurs de l'Académie Royale des Sciences Avec Figures en Taille-Douce, vol. I (Paris: Desaint &amp; Saillant, 1761). The work was separately paginated, which facilitated its independent circulation. The Encyclopèdie article is illustrated by a famous series of plates, published in 1767, which comprise the first detailed pictorial representation of the workings of a white-paper mill. All the material in the Encyclopédie relevant to the making of a book, including the plates, is reproduced in Giles Barber, Book Making in Diderot's Encyclopédie: a Facsimile Reproduction (Farnborough : Gregg International, 1973). Giovanni Domenico Peri, like Goussier, was not a paper-maker by profession, nor even the owner of a mill, but, again like Goussier, though not with the same thoroughness, he had informed himself from members of the trade about the processes involved, and had seen a mill in operation, as is revealed by his exclamation of wonder at how quickly the pulp, made of "merely rags and water, which have no viscous or resistant qualities," is transformed into a stout sheet of paper—an emotion shared by all who see paper made for the first time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Italy is the home of European paper making, which developed from Arab paper-making techniques imported into Spain at an early date, and then into Italy in the twelfth century. 3 3. For the history of paper making see Dard Hunter, Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, 2nd ed. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1947), frequently reprinted ; and Peter F. Tschudin, Grundzüge der Papiergeschichte (Stuttgart: Anton Hiersemann , 2002); see also Richard L. Hills, Papermaking in Britain: A Short History (London: Athlone Press, 1988), pp. 13-29. Three innovations distinguish European from Arab paper making: a much more efficient method of beating the rags into pulp, the use of a size based on animal rather than on vegetable matter, and the addition of lime to the beaten rags at some point in the manufacturing process. Together they made European paper far more durable than Arab paper. Fabriano has always claimed the credit for the first two of these innovations , but it has recently been suggested that experiments in these directions may have first occurred at or near the point of entry of Arab paper, i.e. ports on the Tyrrhenian Sea such as Genoa and Amalfi. Certainly the first known Genoese document relating to paper making is very early. 1235. 4 4. See Peter F. Tschudin, `Paper Comes to Italy', in IPH Congress Book 12 (1998): Papers of the 24th International Congress of Paper Historians, Porto, Portugal, 11-20 September 1998 (Basel: Peter F. Tschudin, 2001), pp. 60-66; text of the document, with English translation, pp. 65-66. For a discussion of the reasons for the durability of European paper see, in the same volume, Jozef Dabrowski and John S. G. Simmons, `Permanence of early European hand-made papers: some technological aspects and the evidence of F. M. Grapaldo (c. 1494) and of the Regensburg Regulations (XVI 2/2c)', pp. 253-263. However, if innovations did occur in North Italy in the thirteenth century, it was at Fabriano that they were refined and developed, and made part of a fully integrated production system, which led Fabriano to become in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the undisputed centre of the manufacture of fine-quality white paper in Italy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From an early date paper was manufactured for local consumption, often to a high standard, in or near many other Italian cities, particularly in central and northern Italy. But it was not until the sixteenth century that serious rivals appeared to challenge the hegemony of Fabriano. The vastly increased demand for paper resulting from the advent of print led to the development of a substantial paper industry in the Veneto, particularly in the valley of the torrente Toscolano, on the western shore of Lake Garda, which served the Venetian printing industry (or so it seems: the evidence, though compelling , is entirely circumstantial, at least before 1548). The sixteenth century also saw the rise of a paper industry in Genoa, destined to become by the time of Peri's account the largest centre of paper production in Italy, and indeed in Europe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paper making at Genoa has a long history, as we have seen. 5 5. For more information on early Genoese paper see Charles Moïsé Briquet, `Papiers et filigranes des archives de Gênes, 1154 à 1700', first published in Atti della Società Ligure di Storia Patria, 19 (1887), pp. 269-394, and reprinted in Briquet's Opuscula: The Complete Works of Dr. C. M. Briquet without "Les filigranes", Monumenta Chartae Papyraceae Historiam Illustrantia, IV (Hilversum: The Paper Publications Society, 1955) pp. 171-218. This article contains one of the great understatements of scholarship, when Briquet refers to his contribution, with its 594 tracings of watermarks, as "de simples notes d'un touriste en passage". But the first signs of what can be called an industry do not appear until the second half of the fifteenth century. Genoa was never a centre of printing in the Renaissance ; what fuelled the growth of its paper industry was the increased demand for good-quality writing paper, brought about by the emergence of the early modern state and its attendant bureaucracy. What was a steady growth in the first half of the sixteenth century was turned into a rapid expansion in the second half by political events, which gave Genoese merchants privileged access to the markets of the Spanish New World and made Genoa, rather than Antwerp, the point of arrival of Spanish bullion destined for the European market, and Genoese bankers the means through which it was traded to the rest of Europe. 6 6. It was this which led the period to be christened "the age of the Genoese"; see Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, translated from the French by Siân Reynolds, 2nd ed. (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1995), I, pp. 500-508. Braudel's views on the importance of Genoa at this time are summarized in the article `Le siècle des Génois s'achève-t-il en 1627?', in Braudel, Autour de la Méditerranée, édition établie et presentée par Roselyne de Ayala et Paule Braudel (Paris: Éditions de Fallois, 1996), pp. 433-446.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These developments brought an influx of wealth to Genoa. At the time the paper industry was only third in importance in the republic, being surpassed by both wool and silk. But Genoese bankers and merchants quickly realized its potential for development, and from the second half of the sixteenth century invested their new-found wealth heavily in it. The industry was concentrated in a series of short, steep valleys just to the west of Genoa itself, which run down to the sea from the crest of the Apennines, at this point only a few kilometers inland. 7 7. In what follows I draw extensively on Paolo Cevini's splendid book (see note 1), an erudite study by an architectural historian of the buildings which served the industry, a number of which were still standing in the second half of last century, and figure in many of the numerous black and white illustrations, mainly photographs, contained in the book. For the workings of the mills Cevini relies on Peri's account, fleshed out by much documentary evidence, which helps to recreate the feverish tempo of life in the paper valleys, with the daily comings and goings of rags and paper, the never-ending maintenance work on the mills, and the continual construction of new buildings. Its centre was Voltri, situated on the coast where two separate rivers, one with a substantial tributary, flow into the sea on either side of the town. Several geographical and geological features favoured paper production in the area. The steepness of the valleys created a good head of water, the rainfall was high, and the area windy. Furthermore, the streams were fed not only by rainwater but from deep springs in the rock, so that the flow of water remained constant, or at least adequate, all the year round. Finally Genoese shipping ensured a regular supply of rags and an easy outlet for the finished product.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This product, for which Genoa was famous, was good-quality white writing paper, though there were a few brown-paper mills, mainly to be found in smaller valleys to the east and west of Voltri. According to official figures, in 1544 there were twenty-nine white-paper mills in the three Voltri valleys alone. By 1588 the number had risen to forty, and by 1612 to sixty-three . Documents quoted by Cevini show that Genoese white-paper mills followed more or less the model described by Peri, that is, they were all solid constructions of masonry with two water-wheels and ten troughs, big enough to accommodate, in one building of three floors, all the activities necessary to turn rags into paper. One of these documents, a contract dated 12 March 1493 for the building of a mill, shows that the model, at least in its major production component of two wheels and ten troughs, predated by many years the injection of venture capital into the industry in the second half of the sixteenth century. 8 8. Cevini, pp. 19-20, and notes 29 and 30.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first the mills were situated on the valley floors, but with the development of the industry in the sixteenth century space there ran out, and the mills began to colonize the steep valley slopes. A few were sited on natural water-courses, but many were not, and had to be fed by water brought by artificially constructed channels, called beudi, running across the steep slopes from points higher up the valley. This led to one of the characteristic features of the Genoese paper-mill scenery, the siting of mills on the hillside one below the other, or in cascata, as it was called, so that they could use the same water supply. Surviving structures show that the two wheels were normally sited on the short side of the building, which was itself disposed lengthways on the hillside, but sometimes the configuration of the ground required a building to be aligned in the direction of the slope, with the wheels on the longer side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All the features I have mentioned are epitomized in the most remarkable development in the history of the Genoese paper industry, the construction in the second and third decades of the seventeenth century of an entire village , San Bartolomeo delle Fabbriche, dedicated to the manufacture of paper. This had a small palazzo, a square, a church and no less than nineteen mills in cascata, seventeen of them white-paper and two brown-paper. Water was brought to this complex by two beudi. The upper one, a solid construction of masonry, ran for one kilometre across the hillside, finally depositing its water in a little reservoir above the topmost mill. The village survives to this day, with the buildings now largely in domestic use, many without major alterations to their external structural features.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the form of contract at the end of Peri's text shows, the master of a Genoese mill at this time had little independence, being no more than a salaried employee of the owner. These owners belonged to the upper reaches of Genoese society, with strong political influence, and made sure through punitive legislation that neither the master nor his workforce had any real autonomy. The master was assisted by three salaried staff; the remaining workforce of a dozen or so, men, women, and children, were piece-workers. In addition to the vatman ( lavorante in our text; sometimes, elsewhere in Italy, lavorente ) and the coucher ( ponidore ) this group included the studiente, whose job it was to supervise every aspect of the processes involved in turning rags into stuff. 9 9. In Villa Basilica in Tuscany the term used for this workman was reggente di pila; see Renzo Sabbatini, Di bianco lin candida prole: la manifattura della carta in età moderna e il caso toscano (Milan: FrancoAngeli, 1990), pp. 57-58. In another Tuscan source, the interesting if sentimental memoirs of a twentieth-century mill-owner from Pescia, it is the maestro (called ministro in this area) who is responsible for the preparation and treatment of the rags; the studente is concerned solely with the beating process; see Carlo Magnani, Ricordanze di un cartaio (Alpignano, Alberto Tallone, 1979), pp. 22-34. It should be remembered that the Genoese mills were intended for the manufacture of good-quality writing paper, which explains the time and care taken over the beating of the rags. Without going into the difficult question of the difference, if any, in this period in the manufacture of paper for writing and paper for printing, it is interesting that one of the few features of mills in the Lake Garda area which emerge from the documentation available is their small size, compared to the Genoese mills. In the period up to 1560, mills with two wheels rarely figure in these documents; the typical Toscolano mill of the period had only one wheel and not more than four troughs. 10 10. 152 documents relating to paper mills and the paper trade in the Toscolano area, covering the period 1460-1560, are published in Volume II of Leonardo Mazzoldi, Filigrane di cartiere bresciane, 2 vols (Brescia: Ateneo di Scienze Lettere ed Arti, 1990-1991). Volume I contains tracings of 1036 watermarks, with countermarks where relevant, taken from documents mostly from the Toscolano area now in the Archivio di Stato, Brescia. The documents in Volume II, many relating to the purchase or letting of mill sites or buildings, but also occasionally comprising contracts between paper-makers and mill-owners or financiers, would benefit from a careful study by an expert paper historian. Unfortunately, early mill buildings in the area have all disappeared through modernisation or neglect, and many sites remain unidentified. See also Ivo Mattozzi, `Il distretto cartario dello stato veneziano: lavoro e produzione nella Valle del Toscolano dal XIV al XVIII secolo', in Cartai e stampatori a Toscolano: vicende, uomini, paesaggi di una tradizione produttiva, ed. Carlo Simoni (Brescia: Grafo, 1995), pp. 23-65.n.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the eighteenth century the waning power of Genoa and the growth of strong paper industries in other European countries led to a decline, made terminal by the obstinate refusal of the majority of Genoese mill-owners and paper-makers to modernize. As late as 1846 only eighteen of the 175 mills in Liguria had adopted the Hollander, and only one had a paper-making machine. 11 11. See Cevini, p. 224. These circumstances help to explain why so many mill structures survive to this day, some in ruins, but others more or less intact because, like the buildings of Le Fabbriche, they have been converted to other uses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Giovanni Domenico Peri (c. 1590-1666) is an interesting figure who has not yet been adequately studied. 12 12. He is not to be confused, as has happened in some prestigious recent catalogues— such as the Catalogue of Seventeenth Century Italian Books in the British Library (London: The British Library, 1986), Roberto L. Bruni and D. Wyn Evans, Italian 17th-Century Books in Cambridge Libraries: A Short-Title Catalogue, Biblioteca di Bibliografia Italiana, CXLIII (Florence: Leo S. Olschki, 1997), and the on-line catalogue COPAC—with the poet of the same name, who lived in Tuscany from 1564 to 1639, on whom see Letteratura italiana. Gli autori. Dizionario bio-bibliografico e indici, 2 vols (Turin: Einaudi, 1990-1991), II, p. 1366. I wish to express my gratitude to Anna Giulia Cavagna, who kindly furnished me with the relevant part of a forthcoming study on printing and publishing in Genoa in the early modern period, on which much of this paragraph is based. On Peri see also Maria Maira Niri, La tipografia a Genova e in Liguria nel XVII secolo, Biblioteca di Bibliografia Italiana, CXLIII (Florence: Leo S. Olschki, 1998), pp. 311-318. According to seventeenth-century biographical sources, he received a humanist education and at first devoted himself to the arts. He also appears briefly in mid-century as director of a printing and publishing enterprise which produced sixteen titles between 1648 and 1650. This enterprise was financed by Anton Giulio Brignole Sale (1605-1665), a leading Genoese politician and intellectual, but came to an abrupt end in 1650 when Brignole Sale decided to become a Jesuit. The editions were signed with the unusual formula: `Sotto la cura/direzione di Gio. Domenico Peri', which suggests that Peri's functions in this organization were more managerial than technical. His claim to fame rests on a work on business practices, Il negotiante, of which the first volume appeared in Genoa in 1639 and the second in 1647. I frutti d'Albaro of 1651, which contains Peri's chapter on paper making, is the third volume. The first two volumes were republished in Venice in 1649, and the whole work at least four times there, in 1672, 1682, 1697, and 1707. It is clear from the text of these works that, whatever his youthful education and his other activities, Peri was an experienced businessman. The first volume of Il negotiante starts with general advice on how to run a successful business in seventeenth-century Genoa, but the rest of the volume, and the whole of the second volume, are devoted to an account of the workings of the complex system of international credit, controlled in this period by the Genoese at quarterly `fairs of payment', which facilitated trade between the states of southern Europe. 13 13. See Herman van der Wee, `Monetary, Credit and Banking Systems', in The Cambridge Economic History of Europe. Volume V, ed. E. E. Rich and C. H. Wilson (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1977), Chapter V, pp. 290-392; 319-322. A facsimile reprint of Volumes I and II of Il negotiante, from the 1649 Venetian edition, was published recently as Italian, Volume 3, of the anthology Historic Accounting Literature, Series II (London: Pickering and Chatto, 1989-90). In contrast, I frutti d'Albaro is something of a ragbag. The chapter on paper making has no precedent in the three volumes; no description is offered anywhere of other trades. Perhaps Peri had some connections with the paper industry, or perhaps his curiosity had been aroused during his two years as manager of a printing and publishing business. His account of the paper-making process is that of a well-informed outsider, who describes its major stages without going into too much detail, and at times seemingly slipping into error, as when he describes the vatman as topping up the vat by using his mould, a procedure which is hard to credit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Chapter 14 of I frutti d'Albaro the passage which I have translated is preceded by some rhetorical remarks on the utility of paper, of little interest in this context. In my translation I have tried to express what I think Peri wrote, not what a modern paper historian might think he ought to have written. I have used English equivalents of the Italian technical terms, where possible; when I do not know of an English equivalent, I have left the Italian term in italics. I have annotated the translation where appropriate. For the Italian text I have transcribed long `s' as short `s' and consonantal `u' as `v', and modernised the use of accents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Giovanni Domenico Peri, I frutti d'Albaro (Genova: Giovanni Maria Farroni, 1651) From Chapter XIV (pp. 63-71), "Mill for making writing paper" I come now to describe the mill for making this paper, which on Genoese territory, and particularly at Voltri, reaches perfection. And to speak first of the building and its fittings, I say that the building should be in an airy locality and site, open to the north and west winds, which are suitable for drying the sheets of paper quickly and well, after they have been taken out of the water, and later, when they have been sized. the waters should be abundant and clear, with a good fall, so that they have more force to work the stampers which beat the rags. 14 14. Peri's text confuses here pile (= troughs) with stampers (= mazzi ). I translate what I take to be his meaning; and see note 18 below. the master mason should have previous experience of such buildings, with respect both to the works in masonry, and to the wooden and metal fittings. The site of the building, which is of two storeys, 15 15. I.e. on three floors. is normally about 23-25 m long and 10 m wide. 16 16. I use the equivalence 1 palmo = 25 cm in this translation; for exact measurements of some surviving mill structures, which confirm the accuracy of Peri's figures, see Cevini, pp. 187-188. On the ground floor are placed the troughs and the camshafts; 17 17. The standard length of the camshafts, which were usually made of beechwood, was 31 palmi, that is, about 7.75 m; see Cevini, p. 196 and note 22. the latter are connected to the wheels, which with the force of the water make the stampers beat the aforesaid troughs. 18 18. Once again Peri's text confuses the terms pile and mazzi, and again I translate what I take to be his meaning. Subsequently he uses pile for troughs and mazzi for stampers, without further confusion. There is also a chest 3.75-4 m long and 2-2.5 m wide, in which the rags are placed to rot, so that they are easier to beat, and the chest is called the mettidore. Other containers are needed, also of masonry, to take the rags after they have been beaten. In another room on the same floor there is a vat, likewise of masonry, 5 m in circumference 19 19. About 1.6 m in diameter; see Cevini, p. 198. and about 1 m high, with a chest beside it containing ready for use the material which has been beaten in the troughs, from which the vatman (for this is the name of the workman who makes the paper) transfers with the mould as much of the material to the vat, as he uses in making the paper, so that the level is always the same. Near the vat is a large press, about 2.5 m high, with two beams, one of which is buried in the ground and stands on two feet, also buried in the ground, to give it stability; and to hold the beams firm they have two wooden screws with metal pins, and two nuts on the screws to grip and exert pressure on the upper beam. 20 20. The type of large press described here is illustrated in a sixteenth-century ex voto from Fabriano; two thick wooden screws, inserted into the bottom beam, one near each end of the press, rise vertically to protrude through the upper beam, with the nuts above, in the form of wooden collars with two horizontal handles, with which they can be screwed down; see Calegari, La manifattura genovese della carta, Tavola II and p. 142. As soon as half a ream of paper, that is, 250 sheets, has been made, it is placed between woollen felts and pressed between the two beams, using the nuts, by the physical exertion of three men and the same number of women. On the first floor are the living quarters of the Master, and another room where the paper is burnished, called the lisciadore. A further room is used to clean the rags of dust and shred them; this is called the crolladore. In yet another room is a large copper boiler with a fire, a little over 1 m in height and 2.5 m in circumference, in which the size is heated; near it is a container about 1.25 m long and 75 cm wide, which holds the size, when it is made. Above this container is another small portable press of dimensions proportionate to the container; in this the sheets are pressed so that they become soft and soak up the size, as we shall describe at the appropriate time. The function of this press is to remove the water from the paper, so that all that is left in it is the size. The top floor consists of a single room with window openings all around the walls, which are called rebatte. 21 21. More precisely, the rebatte are the shutters which fill the window openings. The room is called the drying loft, and here the sheets are spread out to dry and hung on certain thin ropes called terragnine, which are attached to wooden frames near the eaves of the roof. Here the sheets of paper dry before being sized. The said rebatte are opened or closed according to whether the wind is favourable or not, so as not to damage the sheets when they are wet. Among the fittings is a grating made of trappe, that is, narrow pieces of wood set close together, where the rags are beaten and shaken to clean them of dust, and this is the first stage. Then they are placed on a bench or table running the whole length of the room, divided into three or four compartments , in each of which is fixed a piece of iron shaped like a hand, a little curved, facing downwards, with sharp edges, to tear and shred the rags, and it is called the squarcio. The rags are divided into three qualities, that is fioretto, fiorettone and gruzzoto. 22 22. The terms fioretto and fiorettone are found in other Italian paper-making areas, though unfortunately not always with the same meaning; see Ezio Ornato et al., La carta occidentale nel tardo medioevo (Rome: Istituto Centrale per la Patologia del Libro, 2001), Tome I, pp. 335-355. They are also used to describe the quality of the finished product. In this text fioretto is the top quality. In Genoa, brown-paper mills, which were smaller than white-paper ones, usually with only one wheel, were called edifici da gruzzo. A workman called the studiente places them in the mettidore, keeping separate the different qualities of rags. Here he sprinkles them with a little water, so that they can heat and rot and thus be more easily beaten. When they are ready they are placed in the troughs on the ground floor; these number ten, that is, five to one wheel, called a cinci, and five to the other, four of which are called da repisto, and the fifth da sfilato. 23 23. a cinci = for the rags; da repisto = for the second beating; da sfilato = for perfecting . The troughs are concave and made of marble, with insides which are almost oval in shape, and each holds about half a barrel of water. 24 24. According to Cevini, p. 190 and note 18, surviving examples are about 70 cm high, 1.3 m long and from 85 c to 1 m wide. The bottom of these troughs is lined for its whole length and width with an iron sheet weighing about 50 kg, 25 25. The cantara of the Italian text is a pre-decimalisation measure of weight, equalling in Genoa 47.75 kg; see Cevini, p. 190, note 19. kept firmly in place with wood and lead. Each trough is beaten by three stampers, made of oak or some similar wood; these stampers have 30 iron nails called biette, weighing about a pound each. 26 26. The Italian pound ( libbra, libra, lira ) weighed about 300 g, considerably less than the British and American pound (about 450 g). Each stamper is attached to a shaft, which fits between another wooden element called a key and has a wooden pivot running through the middle; this allows the stampers to rise and fall, according as the water makes the wheel and camshaft revolve. The stampers are arranged in such a way that, with three stampers to a trough, when the first one rises in the first trough, it is followed by the second in the second trough, and then by the third stamper in the last one, 27 27. So the Italian text; perhaps Peri means the third one. without anyone intervening. And the said studiente knows when the rags are beaten, and goes and takes them out. Water is brought continuously to the troughs by certain small channels, and even though it is clean water, it is first placed in basins and passed over certain filters made of copper and of the hairs of horses' tails, to make sure it is free from bits of wood or straw, or other pieces of dirt, and it flows continuously in and out. It leaves the trough by another hole lower down, which is also provided with a filter, so that the beaten rags do not drain away with the water; and while the material is in the trough the stampers are so cleverly made that as they beat they also stir it up, so that it is continuously washed and at the same time uniformly beaten; and all this happens without the intervention of anyone, until it becomes as white as milk. After the rags have been beaten in this first row of troughs the beaten material is put into the containers already mentioned and sprinkled with powdered lime, and thus it stays for several days; the lime foments it, reduces it, and eats away the hairs, or anything else that might still be in it, and prevents it from rotting. At the appropriate time the material is placed in the four troughs da repisto, and by beating it again, with the water flowing continuously through the troughs, it is purged and made perfect. After this second beating it is placed a little at a time in the fifth trough. This is a little bigger than the others; it has no iron lining or nails, because its function is simply to dilute with water the beaten material which comes into it and then stays there, but it has on the bottom a slab of millstone grit. The stampers have no nails, but it is true that they are larger than the others, and as they beat they dilute the material until it seems just like snow. It is straightaway placed in the chest which we have already mentioned next to the first vat, 28 28. In his earlier description of the mill Peri refers to only one vat, a detail borne out by the surviving documentation, and also by the evidence of surviving structures. to which the vatman adds it as required, in proportion to the material used up in the making of the paper. There is a boy called the lavadore, whose job it is from time to time to stir one or maybe two paddles fixed to the ceiling above the vat, which are long enough to reach to the bottom; by moving the paddles the boy makes the beaten material, which gradually sinks to the bottom , rise to the surface; and thus the stuff is kept uniformly dense, so that the sheets of paper, which are made one at a time, are all of the same consistency . The vatman has two moulds of the size of the sheet he wishes to make, exactly the same in every respect, made of copper wire on a wooden frame, on which is superimposed the device and name of the owner of the mill. To handle the mould he has another wooden frame, made like a picture frame, which he puts over it; he then lowers it carefully with both hands, puts it in the water and pulp of the vat, and then takes it out gradually and gently, shaking it a little, which makes the water run away through the mesh of copper wire, and so the material thickens; then the vatman hands it to another workman, known as the coucher, who places it on a woollen felt. Inclining the mould to the right the coucher gradually transfers the whole sheet onto the felt, to which it immediately adheres, and on this he straightaway places another felt; then he hands the empty mould back to the vatman, who gives him in return a second mould with another sheet, which he places on top of the felt like the first one. So they continue until they have finished a post, which is half a ream of paper, that is, 250 sheets. This post is about 1.12 m high, and they put it immediately under the press, and by physical effort, as we have said, it is pressed until almost all the water has run out. It is immediately taken out of the press and with the help of the boy known as the layer the first felt is removed and the first sheet detached, and in the same way all the other sheets are detached from the felts with such skill, that sometimes out of the 250 sheets not a single one is spoiled; then they are placed one on top of the other so accurately and carefully that they seem like a bar of soap. And so they go until evening, in which time, working from eight o'clock in the morning—a fixed time, all the year round—until sunset, they make about twenty posts, which equal ten reams, which make up a bale of paper. 29 29. In fact the hours worked in mid-seventeenth century Genoese paper mills, and so the daily production of paper, were often greater than those given by Peri; see Calegari, p. 108; Cevini, p. 205. In the evening they put all the posts together, one on top of the other, under a different press, and press them, so that a little more water comes out, and they leave them there all night; the next day they take them to the drying room to dry, and hang them on thin ropes; and so as not to tear them they have to take five or six sheets at a time, which they then hang up on these ropes, folded down the middle; when they are dry they seem like pieces of cardboard, and they are gathered together, opened out, put in a pile, and left until it is time to size them. Sizing takes place from October 1 until the end of June; really hot weather is not suitable. 30 30. For confirmation of this substantial pause in the sizing during high summer see Sabbatini, p. 58. Magagni's comments (pp. 52-53) are more nuanced: both hot weather and really cold weather are unsuitable for making the size, but if it has to be made in summer, it should be done during the night. The pause must have created serious problems, if only of storage, in the Genoese white-paper mills. I cannot help remarking that the way paper is made is a marvellous thing, because, as we have said, the materials from which it is made are merely rags and water, which have no viscous or resistent qualities, and yet the sheets of paper made from them have such consistency that they are better than cloth, and they are made even stronger by the use of size, as we shall now say below. This size is made from carnuccio, that is from remains left over when animal skins are tanned. It is heated in the boiler mentioned above, and then poured through a woollen felt to remove impurities and fat. It is put into the container next to the boiler, and while the temperature of the size is such that it is possible to put one's hand in, the paper is placed in it, and allowed to become fully soaked; then the paper is put through the press above the container and pressed until all the water has come out, and only the substance of the size remains, through which the paper acquires the strength to resist the wind and the rain in window-openings, 31 31. Cevini records (p. 220) that even as late as the second half of the eighteenth century paper was used instead of glass in the window openings of the mills, apart from those in the drying lofts, with their shutters. The use of oil-paper instead of glass in the windows of an inn near Venice is mentioned in an entry in Goethe's diary for 13 September 1786 (I owe this reference to a note by Barry Watson in the British Association of Paper Historians News, 56 [Autumn 2004], 7.) and to take ink. And here we see another marvellous thing, because when they are being sized the sheets are so dry and arid that anyone wanting to separate one from another cannot do so without tearing them, and the only thing which makes it possible to separate them is the size. So the size, which makes everything else stick together, unsticks and separates the sheets—which occurs through some hidden potency and property which it possesses. As soon as the paper has been pressed they take it still warm to the drying loft and, placing it on a table called the predola, with a wooden instrument shaped like a capital T they lay it out sheet by sheet on those ropes, and boys between 8 and 10 years old separate the sheets by hand and by blowing on them, with great agility and speed, without tearing any, and they leave them spread out until they are dry. Then they gather them up, make them into quires, and take them to the burnishing room, where they are pressed once again, and there on a table running the whole length of the room are six to eight sites or places fitted with slabs of marble, on which the paper is burnished by women, who are very suitable for this task, and do it so quickly and with such agility that you can scarcely see their hands. And while they are burnishing it, they also sort it, putting to one side the imperfect sheets; then it is arranged by the Master in quires, in reams and in bundles, and sent to the Owner, who leaves it packaged in reams and puts it into large bales. 32 32. Italian text: balloni. According to Calegari, p. 57, a ballone, comprising about two and a half bales, was the measure in which paper was traded in Genoa. Annual Agreement with the Master of the Mill The Owner of the papermill has to provide the Master who is to make the paper with 400 cantare of rags every year, 33 33. About 190 quintali, or 19,000 kg. and the Master is required to return to the owner for every 100 cantare 75 bales of white writing paper of the usual size and weight, that is 12½ pounds per ream. A bale is taken to be of ten reams, a ream of twenty quires and a quire of twenty-five sheets. In every ream it is understood that there will be three quires of imperfect sheets, two at the bottom and one at the top; these imperfect quires are of twenty-four sheets. The building and the site should be handed to the Master with everything in order, and in this condition he should hand it back when he leaves, and he is required to supply ropes for the presses, stampers, shafts, boiler, impidori, to keep in good repair the nails, shafts, reinette and seo, 34 34. Diligent enquiries among colleagues in Britain and Italy have failed to establish the meaning of these italicized words. In an e-mail of 8 June 2004 Paolo Cevini refers to the problems faced even by an expert such as himself when confronted by (I translate) `the complex nature of an uncodified lexic, half way between the "official" language of the legal documents (often in Latin) and the empirical vocabulary of the workforce, mediated through the interpretation of Peri.' and to supply the materials for maintaining the troughs. The said owner has to provide the size, felts, moulds, ropes for the drying loft, firewood and everything needed to be able to work, and all of this he will charge to the Master. Each Saturday the Master will be given the money he needs, and for making the paper he will be paid eight lire of our current money per bale. For every 400 cantare of rags the Owner is to receive in return 300 bales of paper, and in addition the Master should make from these rags thirty to forty further bales, for which he should be paid at the current rate, that is, the price paper normally fetches, and the owner has to feel the benefit of this increased production, as in the rest of the paper which has been made for him. With regard to this surplus some Masters sometimes use little loyalty, as a custom has grown up whereby they sell it to others, even though this has been prohibited by law with heavy penalties both for the sellers and the buyers. Among the 300 bales of paper there are usually eight to ten bales of inferior goodness, according to the quality of the rags, and these are called gruzzotti, and the owner accepts them, as is customary. The best rags are Florentine, then those from Lombardy, then our own, and the least good come from Naples and other places. There is a difference in price, which arises from the quality of the rags, the best of which give several bales of fioretti, and these are sold at 20-25% more than the ordinary price. With rags of inferior quality the Master of the mill is allowed some imperfections, which even out the difference of price, for the same consignment of rags is used in manufacturing fioretti as in making ordinary paper. From Chapter XIV (pp. 63-71), "Fabrica della carta da scrivere" E per venire alla relatione della fabbrica d'essi paperi, che riescono qua nel dominio genovese, massime a Voltri, perfettissimi, parlando prima della casa, &amp; arnesi stabili dico, che L'habitatione ha da essere in paese e sito fresco, dominato da vento Tramontana e Ponente, che sono a proposito per asciugar i paperi presto e bene, quando sono tratti dall'acqua, e quando poi s'incollano. L'acque hanno da esservi abondanti e chiare, con buona caduta, perché habbia maggior forza per far batter le pile, che pestano le straccie. Il capo d'opera ha d'haver sperienza di tal fabbrica per l'opera di calcina, legnami e ferramenti. Il sito della fabbrica di doi solari, per ordinario va di longhezza palmi 90 in 100 e di larghezza 40 in circa. Sopra il primo piano a terreno se vi mettono le pile con gli alberi congionti alle ruote, le quali con l'acqua fanno pistare le dette pile, o siano mazzi. Ci va poi un troglio longo palmi 15 in 16 e largo otto in diece, in questo ripongonsi le straccie a marcire, perché siano più facili a pistare, &amp; il troglio è chiamato il mettidore. Vi vogliono altre casse pur di materia da riponer le straccie, quando son fatte in pisti. In altra stanza pur nel detto piano ha da esservi una tina pur di materia in giro rotondo palmi 20 e di altezza palmi 4 in circa, con un troglio appresso, ove si tiene la materia delli pisti preparati per lavorare, di dove il Lavorante (che così chiamasi colui che fa il papero) con la forma va somministrando tanta della sudetta materia in detta tina, quanta si va sminuendo nel fare i fogli, accioché stia sempre piena ad un segno. Presso a detta tina vi è una soppressa grossa, che sarà palmi diece, con li doi banchi che vi vanno, uno de' quali sta sotto terra con due zochi pur sotterrati, per tenerlo saldo, &amp; ad essi se vi mettono due vide di legno con perni di ferro, per tenerli stretti, &amp; a dette vide due morse 35 35. 1651 edition: morle. per stringere e calcare il banco di sopra. Subito che è formato il papero, cioè mezza risma, che sono fogli 250, si ripone in mezzo a' feltri di lana, e si suppressa nel mezzo di detti doi banchi con le dette morle a forza di braccio col ministerio di tre huomini &amp; altretante donne. Nel primo solaro sono le stanze per l'habitatione del Maestro, &amp; un'altra dove si lisciano li paperi, addimandato il Lisciadore. V'è un altro sito ancora per purgar e crollar le straccie dalla polvere; questo è detto il Crolladore. Ve n'è anco un altro, ove sta la Caldaia di rame assai grande, con fogone, per cuocer la colla, alta palmi quattro e mezzo in circa, e larga in giro palmi diece; a questa sta vicino un troglio longo palmi cinque e largo tre in circa, ove si tiene la colla, quando è cotta. Sopra questo sta un'altra soppressetta piccola portabile, e proportionata al detto troglio, nel quale si calca il papere, e se vi fa amollire &amp; imbeverare, come si dirà a suo luogo. Bisogna a forza di detta soppressa 36 36. 1651 edition: sorpressa. farne uscire l'acqua, e vi resta sola incorporata la colla. L'ultimo solaro contiene una stanza sola con balconi d'ogn intorno, a' quali si dice Rebatte. La stanza è detta lo Spanditore, perché se vi spandono e stendono li paperi per asciugarli sopra certe cordicciuole dette terragnine, attaccate a' legni presso alla gronda del tetto. Qui s'asciugano detti paperi formati in fogli, e poi s'incollano. Le sudette Rebatte con li venti favorevoli s'aprono, e con li contrarij si serrano, perché non dannifichino li detti paperi così bagnati. Fra gli arnesi sono una grata di trappe, o sia di tavolette strette discoste un poco l'una dall'altra, ove si sbattono e crollano dette straccie per purgarle dalla polvere, e questa è la prima mano. Si ripongono poi sopra un banco, o sia tavola, longa quanto è la stanza, a quale vi son ripartiti tre o quattro luoghi, ad ogn'uno de' quali sta fisso un ferro come la mano, un poco adunco, col taglio che sta all'in giù, per squarciare e stritolare le straccie, e si chiama lo Squarcio. Le straccie si dividono in tre qualità, cioè fioretto, fiorettone e gruzzoto. Un operario addimandato lo Studiente le colloca nel mettidore, ripartendo le qualità; ivi le asperge di poc'acqua, perché si scaldino e marcischino , e si possino pistare più facilmente. Quando sono preparate si mettono in le pile nel primo piano a numero diece, cioè cinque ad una rota, che dicono a Cinci, e cinque all'altra rota, quattro de' quali si dicono da repisto, e l'altra da sfilato. Sono di marmo concave, col vaso quasi ovato, e teniranno mezzo bacile d'acqua in circa l'una; sopra il piano di queste vi è una piastra di ferro di peso un cantaro in circa, che tiene tutta la longhezza e larghezza del fondo, al quale con legno e piombo benissimo si unisce. In ogn'una di esse pile vi batton tre mazzi di rovere o di altro legno simile, a' quali sono fissi trenta denti detti biette, che sono di ferro, in peso una lira l'uno in circa, e li mazzi sono attaccati ad una stanga fraposta ad un legno detto Chiave, con un perno pur di legno, che vi passa per mezzo; questo opera che si possino alzare e calare li mazzi, conforme l'acqua fa girare la rota dell'albero, e vanno li detti mazzi con ordine tanto regolato, che essendo tre mazzi per pila, alzandosi uno nella prima pila, segue il secondo nell'altra, così il terzo nell'ultima, senza che vi assista alcuno; &amp; il detto Studiente sa l'hora che devono esser pisti, e va a levarli. Vi sono poi certi canaletti, che portano di continuo l'acqua in dette pile; &amp; ancorché sia acqua netta, la fanno purgare in trogli, e poi passare sopra certe telette tessute di rame e di peli di coda di Cavallo, perché non vi restino né busche, o sian festuche, né altre immonditie, e di continuo entra &amp; esce. Passa poi nella pila per un'altro buco più basso, e vi è parimente la detta teletta, acciò che con l'acqua non vadino via li pisti, e mentre sta in la pila li mazzi son fatti con tale arte, che secondo che pistano fanno anco voltare il pisto, acciò che si lavi di continuo, e che resti pisto ugualmente, il che segue senza l'assistenza d'alcuno, a tal che restano poi bianche come latte. Pisti che sono a queste prime pile, si mettono nelle casse sudette, e se vi sparge fra mezzo calcina in polvere, stando così in riposo qualche giorni; la calcina li fomenta, li ristringe e gli rode i peli, o altro che vi fusse, e fa che non marciscono. A suo tempo si collocano nelle sudette quattro pile da repisto, e di nuovo repistandole con l'acqua che di continuo vi entra &amp; esce, si purgano e perfettionano. Repistato si mette a poco la volta in sudetta pila da sfilato, la quale è un poco più grande della altre; non ha piastra né denti di ferro, perché solo ha da stemprare con l'acqua la materia che v'entra e più non esce. Ha però sopra il fondo una piastra di pietra da molino, &amp; alli mazzi non ha denti; è vero che son più grossi degli altri, e così pistando stemperano di tal maniera quella materia che pare propriamente neve. Subito si mette nello troglio sudetto presso alla prima Tina, ove il Lavorante n'aggiunge secondo il bisogno a proportione di quelle ne va levando nel papero che si fabbrica. Vi è un Garzonetto detto il Lavadore, che ha cura di tanto in tanto di rimescolare un bastone, o siano doi, che attaccati al solaro sopra detta Tina sono tanto longhi che arrivano sino al fondo di essa, e menando li detti bastoni fa venire a galla li pisti, quali a poco a poco scendono al fondo, per tenire la materia sempre densa ad un modo e poter formare li fogli uguali, facendosi un foglio per volta. Il Lavorante ha doe forme della grandezza del foglio che vuole formare, amendue uguali in ogni cosa, fatte di filo di rame sopra un telaro di legnetti, a cui improntano l'impresa e nome del patrone della fabbrica. Per maneggiarla ha un telaro pur di legno fatto come una guarnitione a modo di quadro, dove fa entrare la detta forma; a doi mani la cala giù per filo, l'infonde nell'acqua e materia della detta tina, poi la tira a poco a poco di piano in piano crollandola un poco leggiermente, con fare che l'acqua vada colando per quelle file di rame, e così si va condensando; e così lo porge ad un'altro, che si dice il Ponidore, il quale lo pone sopra un feltro di lana; piegando la forma dalla parte destra pian piano la calca tutta sul feltro, restandovi subito il foglio attaccato, sopra il quale mette subito un altro feltro, e dà la forma vuota al Lavorante, che gli ritorna un'altra forma con un'altro foglio, e lo ripone come il primo sopra il feltro. Così di mano in mano si va facendo, sin che sia finita una posta, che è mezza risma di papero, cioè fogli 250. Resta questa posta alta palmi quattro e mezzo in circa, e la pongono subito sotto la soppressa, &amp; a forza di braccia (come si è detto) si stringe a segno che n'esce quasi tutta l'acqua; si leva subito, e col garzone detto il Levadore si leva il primo feltro e si stacca il primo foglio, e si vanno staccando gli altri con tanta destrezza, che in tutti li 250 tal hor non ne guasta uno, e li ripone uno sopra l'altro tanto uguali &amp; aggiustati che restano come un pane di sapone. Van così continuando sino alla sera, nel qual tempo, lavorando dalle ott'hore (tempo stabilito per tutto l'anno) sino al tramontar del Sole, fabricano circa 20 poste, che sono risme diece, e queste constituiscono una balla di papero. La sera poi l'uniscono, collocandolo uno sopra l'altro sotto differente soppressa , e lo stringono, e ne fanno uscire ancora qualche poc'acqua, lasciandolo così tutta la notte; il giorno poi seguente lo portano ad asciugare sopra lo spanditore, e lo stendono sopra cordicciuole; e per non stracciarlo bisogna pigliarlo a cinque in sei fogli per volta, e così s'appende sopra dette cordicciuole giusto per mezzo, a poi asciutto restando come tanti cartonetti, si raccoglie, si stende e si mette in mucchio, lasciandovisi stare sino al tempo d'incollarlo. Li paperi s'incollano dal primo d'Ottobre per tutto Giugno, essendo contrarii i caldi. Non lasciarò di dire che resta questa formatione di papero maravigliosa, perché, come si è detto, la materia di che si fa è solo straccie &amp; acqua, le quali non hanno del viscoso né del tenace, e pure se ne fanno questi fogli così ben condensati che son meglio che tessuti, e si fanno poi più forti con la colla, come si dirà qui appresso. La detta colla si fa di carnuccio, cioè di quelli avanzi di pelle di animali, che si affaitano. Va cotta in la caldara sudetta, e poi si cala sopra un feltro di lana per levargli le immonditie &amp; il grasso; si mette nel sudetto troglio appresso detta caldara, e mentre è calda a segno di poterli soffrire le mani, se vi infonde il papero, lasciandovelo imbeverar bene; poi si mette sotto la soppressa che sta sopra lo troglio sudetto, e si stringe a segno che tutta l'acqua esce fuora; ne gli resta solo la sostanza della colla, per la quale piglia forza il papero, per poter resistere alli venti &amp; acqua nelle stamegne, &amp; al ricever l'inchiostro. Hor qui si vede un'altra maraviglia, perché que' fogli che s'incollano sono così asciutti &amp; aridi, che chi distaccar vuole un foglio dall'altro non si può senza romperlo, né si può con qualsivoglia altra cosa che con questa colla staccare; e la colla, che tutte l'altre cose attacca insieme, stacca e separa la carta, il che segue per qualche virtù e proprietà occulta. Subito disoppressato il papero lo portano così caldo nello spanditore sudetto, e posto sopra un tavolino detto Predola, con uno stromento di legno fatto a modo di T grande i Spanditori lo stendono a foglio per foglio sopra quelle cordicciuole, e li putti piccoli di 8 in 10 anni con le mani lo staccano similmente a foglio per foglio e col soffio, con molta agilità e prestezza, senza stracciarne, e lo lasciano così steso sino che sia asciutto. Lo raccolgono poi e ne fanno quinterni, portandoli nel Lisciadore, ove di nuovo si soppressa, &amp; ivi sopra un banco tanto longo quanto è il sito della stanza vi sono sei in otto siti o luoghi con lastre di marmo, sopra quali è lisciato il papero dalle donne, al quale uffitio sono molto addattate, e lo fanno con tanta prestezza &amp; agilità, che a pena se le vedono le mani; e mentre lo lisciano ancora lo distinguono, mettendo da parte li mezetti; &amp; accommodato poi dal Maestro in quinterni, in risme &amp; in fasci, mandandolo al Patrone, quale involtato in risme lo fa metter in balloni. Concerto col Maestro dell'Edifitio annualmente Il Patrone dell'Edifitio da Carta ha da provedere al Maestro che deve fabbricarla cantara 400 di straccie per ciascun' anno, &amp; il Maestro è obligato per ogni cantara 100 rispondere al patrone balle 75 di paperi bianchi da scrivere della solita misura e peso, che sono lire dodici e mezza per risma. Una balla s'intende di risme diece, una risma è di quinterni venti, &amp; il quinterno di fogli venticinque. In ogni risma s'intendono tre quinterni di mezzetto, cioè due nel fondo d'essa risma e l'altro sul principio; questi mezzetti sono di fogli ventiquattro. Al Maestro deve esser dato il luogo dell'Edifitio all'ordine d'ogni cosa, e così deve consignarlo quando lo lascia, &amp; ha obligo di proveder li cavi per le suppresse, masse, stanghe, caldare, impidori, far acconciar le Biete, Leve, Reinette, Seo e le manifatture per far acconciar le pile. Il detto Patrone ha da provedere la colla, feltri, forme, terragnina, legne, e tutto quello fa di bisogno per poter lavorare, e di tutto darà debito al Maestro. Al Maestro si provedono ogni Sabbato li danari che li fanno di bisogno, e se gli pagano per manifattura lire otto moneta corrente nostra per ogni balla. Ogni cantare 400 di straccie rispondono al Patrone balle 300 paperi, e di più danno di crescimento al Maestro balle 30 in 40 e questo si paga al Maestro secondo il corso commune, cioè quello che sogliono valer li paperi, &amp; il Patrone ha da sentir l'utile nel crescimento, come lo sentirà nell'altro per lui fabbricato. In questo crescimento alle volte alcuni Maestri usano poca fedaltà, essendo stato introdotto che lo vendono ad altri, se ben ciò la giustitia sotto gravi pene tanto a' venditori quanto a' compratori l'ha prohibito. In le balle 300 paperi ne sogliono uscire da otto in diece balle inferiori di bontà, secondo le qualità delle straccie, e questi sono domandati Gruzzotti, &amp; il Patrone li riceve, così essendo solito. Le straccie migliori sono le Firentine, poi le Lombarde, appresso le nostrali, e le più inferiori sono quelle di Napoli &amp; altre parti. V'è differenza di prezzo, e nasce dalle qualità della straccia, dando le più fine qualche fioretti, e questi si vendono da 20 in 25 per cento più dell'ordinario. Nelle straccie inferiori si fa buono al Maestro dell'Edifitio qualche tara, la quale uguala la differenza del prezzo, poiché la medesima va a fabbricar i paperi fioretti, 37 37. 1651 edition: firetti. come gli ordinarij.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DISSEMINATION OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS CIRCA 1714</field>
      <field name="fulltext">by Don-John Dugas and Robert D. Hume</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HOW readily available to readers were Shakespeare's plays early in the eighteenth century? Students of Shakespeare's dissemination and reception have generally agreed that the six-volume octavo edition published by Jacob Tonson in 1709 was crucially important in making the whole canon widely available. Most seem further to agree that Tonson's eight-volume duodecimo edition of 1714 brought the price within the reach of ordinary bookbuyers. 1 1. Peter Holland states in his helpful and authoritative introduction to a recent facsimile reprint that the 1709 Rowe edition "was much cheaper and more convenient than a Folio edition," which is a fair summary of almost universal twentieth-century scholarly opinion. See The Works of Mr. William Shakespear edited by Nicholas Rowe, 1709, intro. by Peter Holland (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 1999), 1: ix. Public response to these editions, however, was curiously minimal , and their impact on production in the theatre was virtually nil—facts that scholars have largely ignored. Trying to improve our understanding of what was happening in the realms of Shakespeare distribution and reception around the time of the 1714 Tonson edition, we want to ask three questions. Did Tonson issue most of Shakespeare's plays as separates in 1714? (This claim was made a generation ago and has never yet been challenged, so far as we are aware.) How affordable were Tonson's editions? (Almost all scholars have ignored their price.) And if—as we maintain—most of Shakespeare's plays were not issued separately until the 1730s, why not? The idea of marketing Shakespeare separates as early as circa 1714 was by no means implausible in the theatrical and bookselling contexts of the day, and we shall offer evidence that the publisher William Mears had every intention of doing just that, though his hitherto unnoticed scheme came to nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Were Shakespeare's Plays Separately Published in 1714? This question may seem surprising. H. L. Ford's Shakespeare bibliography lists only a few scattered instances of unadapted plays being issued in separate editions between 1700 and the 1730s. 2 2. H. L. Ford, Shakespeare 1700-1740: A Collation of the Editions and Separate Plays (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1935). Shakespeare bibliographers have for more than half a century emphasized the importance of the Tonson-Walker competition of 1734-35 in generating systematic separate publication of the whole canon, a battle that apparently brought the retail price of a Shakespeare play as low as two or three pennies. 3 3. On "The Tonson-Walker Quarrel," see Ford, pp. 40-45. In an advertisement dated 6 September 1734 in his edition of Merry Wives, Tonson objected to Walker's 4 d editions and said, "Notice is hereby given, That each Play so printed by the said R. Walker, or any other Person, will be forthwith printed by the Proprietors of the Copy of the same . . . [and] shall be Sold to all Hawkers for One Penny each Play, so long as this vile Practice goes on." Since the street-hawkers had to make a profit, we deduce that the retail price they charged was 2 d or 3 d. Michael Harris states (without specifying a source) that the price was 1 d "to the hawkers" and 3 d "to the public." See "Paper Pirates: The Alternative Book Trade in Mid-18th Century London," in Fakes and Frauds: Varieties of Deception in Print and Manuscript, ed. Robin Myers and Michael Harris (Winchester: St Paul's Bibliographies, 1989), pp. 47-69 at p. 56. We owe this reference to the kindness of Professor David Vander Meulen. Why then does any question arise? Writing a quarter-century ago in what is still an important account of Jacob Tonson, Harry M. Geduld says flatly that "During 1714, he [Tonson] issued twenty-five of the plays in separate octavo volumes," and lists them in a footnote. 4 4. Harry M. Geduld, Prince of Publishers: A Study of the Work and Career of Jacob Tonson (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1969), p. 138. If this statement has been challenged, we are not aware of it. The implication is that at this time Tonson published single editions of all the plays he considered important or attractive. Geduld appears to be the direct source of Jonathan Bate's statement concerning Tonson's 1714 edition that "individual plays were sold separately, so the popular ones could be obtained extremely cheaply." 5 5. Jonathan Bate, Shakespearean Constitutions: Politics, Theatre, Criticism 1730-1830 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), p. 23. On the dramatic canon and the standing of Shakespeare at the beginning of the eighteenth century, see Paulina Kewes, Authorship and Appropriation : Writing for the Stage in England, 1660-1710 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), esp. chap. 5. If individual plays were made available in 1714, this fact is of great importance : the inaccessibility of most of Shakespeare's plays in single editions prior to the 1730s has long been a given among students of his reputation. Granting that one cannot prove negatives, we doubt the existence of these "separates," and we shall attempt to demonstrate the extreme unlikelihood of Tonson having published them. Geduld says further that these were a " `stage edition,'—produced especially for sale at the theatres," and this claim we will also dispute. We can find no evidence that the books actually existed, but we will show that even if they had existed most of them could not have been intended as "stage editions." Taking them in alphabetical order, the plays Geduld claims were issued in separate, octavo editions in 1714 are All's Well that Ends Well, Antony and Cleopatra, As You Like It, Coriolanus, Cymbeline, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, 1 Henry IV, Henry VIII, King John, King Lear, Richard II, Richard III, Love's Labour's Lost, Macbeth, The Merchant of Venice, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, Timon of Athens, Titus Andronicus, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night, and The Winter's Tale (224, n. 10). If this group of plays had indeed come into print in 1714 as individually available titles, then their collective appearance would constitute one of the major events in the history of the publication of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, the evidence against the existence of this batch of octavos is overwhelming. Ford found none of these twenty-five titles. (Geduld evidently did not think to check this obvious reference source.) No one has ever reported newspaper advertisements for any of these single-title editions of the plays. Neither the detailed catalogue that constitutes the bulk of Hale Sturges's bibliography of the output of Jacob Tonson, Senior, nor the bibliography in G. F. Papali's biography of Tonson lists a single exemplar (in any format) of any of the Shakespeare plays Geduld asserts were published in 1714. 6 6. Hale Sturges, "The Publishing Career of Jacob Tonson, the Elder, 1678-1720" (Diss. Yale, 1936); G. F. Papali, Jacob Tonson, Publisher: His Life and Work (1656-1737) (Auckland : Tonson Publishing House, 1968). No other scholar has found them, and they are not listed in the ESTC, which at this late date we must take as powerful evidence against the existence of any such editions. Yet Geduld's claim is a troubling error. He was not a bibliographical scholar, but he has left us with a very exact list of titles as well as the specific format of the alleged editions, not just a general assertion. What made Geduld imagine that Tonson had issued these plays separately? We can offer two suggestions as to how this gross error came about. First and most obviously, the Tonson eight-volume edition of 1714 prints each play with its own title-page, giving the title, an ornament, and the information "Printed in the Year MDCCXIV." At that time or at any later date, an owner of the edition could have its volumes chopped up into the constituent plays and get them bound that way. If Geduld encountered such separately-bound titles and recognized them as Tonson's, he may simply have assumed that this was their original condition as they came from the publisher. We point out, however, that each volume of the 1714 edition is continuously paginated, so that with the exception of the first play in each volume, the pagination would be a dead giveaway to the non-separate nature of the printing. 7 7. Ford observes dryly that "Each volume commences with a fresh pagination and consequently the initial plays have sometimes been described as separate entities, whereas . . . they must be considered as excerpts" (14). We must also observe that the 1714 edition was published in duodecimo, not octavo. Our second suggestion as to the origin of Geduld's blunder is that he may have derived four of the titles he lists from a more problematic source than those we have already mentioned. William Jaggard's Shakespeare Bibliography reports the existence of "single editions" of four Shakespeare plays that appear in Geduld's list. 8 8. William Jaggard, Shakespeare Bibliography: A Dictionary of Every Known Issue of the Writings of Our National Poet and of Recorded Opinion Thereupon in the English Language (Stratford-on-Avon: Shakespeare Press, 1911). Specifically, Jaggard records a 1714 duodecimo of All's Well that Ends Well, though he states no publisher or source (281). He records a 1714 duodecimo of Macbeth published by Tonson, the text of which "varies from that in Tonson's edition of Shakespeare's works issued that year" (381). Jaggard cites as his evidence a copy in the Shakespeare Memorial Library, Stratford-upon-Avon (now the Shakespeare Centre Library of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust). That library does own a curious (and apparently unique) copy of a separate edition of Macbeth produced for Tonson in 1714 that seems to have been used as the printer's copy for the Macbeth found in the 1714 collected dramatic works. 9 9. Marian J. Pringle, Special Collections Librarian at the Shakespeare Centre Library, has very kindly informed us that this edition possesses "its own dated title-page." It lacks the frontispiece of the collected edition of 1714, except its "pagination is 233-300 (300 wrongly printed 100) . . . matches the collected works, but where the page numbering has been corrected to read 300. . . . The text wording is the same from one to another, and the spacing across the pages is the same, with one or two longer lines squeezed into the single text which has a larger (almost 11pt) size type to the 10pt of the [1714] Works which is a completely new typesetting from the single issue. The woodcuts on the title page and above Act 1 scene 1 are different from one another, as are the two woodcut initials W on the first page." She concludes that the typesetter for the 1714 collected dramatic works "appears to have copied direct from the single play printed text, but he is not always accurate with spelling, or copying names, or less usual words." Jaggard records an octavo of The Taming of the Shrew excerpted from Tonson's 1714 edition (457). 10 10. Obviously this cannot be correct as stated, since an octavo edition cannot be excerpted from a duodecimo. A 1714 "single edition" of Macbeth is reported in S. A. Tannenbaum , Shakespeare's Macbeth: A Concise Bibliography (New York: Samuel A. Tannenbaum, 1939), p. 1. The fact that this edition is illustrated strongly suggests that it was excerpted from the Tonson edition of 1714. As a rule, only play collections contained illustrations; single editions rarely did. Finally, Jaggard announces his discovery of a 1714 octavo of Twelfth Night, "Until now an unrecorded issue, offprinted from Tonson's anonymous edition of Sh—'s works, for the use of playgoers" (479). Yet again, Jaggard cites no source nor does he explain why he believes this play was offprinted for playgoers. (In these last two instances, Jaggard seems not to have considered the unlikelihood of octavo plays being excerpted from a duodecimo play-collection.) Only one of the four 1714 "single editions" recorded by Jaggard now appears actually to have been produced as a separate edition: Macbeth. The extreme rarity of that edition and the likelihood that it was used as the printer's copy for the Macbeth in the 1714 collected dramatic works suggest it was printed for use as a trial edition, not for publication. Geduld seems to have imagined that the rationale behind the (ghost) edition he reported was a desire to sell the plays at the theatre when they were performed. As we have noted, he states that the group of separates "was the first `stage edition,'—produced especially for sale at the theatres and for disposal by running booksellers, who retailed the plays in rural districts" (138). In the abstract, the idea makes sense, but it does not stand up under scrutiny. By implication, these plays were performed circa 1714 and Tonson published single editions of them in order to profit from performance-generated interest . Performance records for London prior to 1705 are extremely sketchy, but they are essentially complete after that, when all theatre companies started putting advertisements in daily newspapers. One need spend only a few minutes with Volume 1 of Hogan's Shakespeare in the Theatre, 1701-1800 or Part 2 of The London Stage (both of which were available to Geduld by 1960) to see that the plays he lists do not correspond well to known performance history. 11 11. Charles Beecher Hogan, Shakespeare in the Theatre, 1701-1800, 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952-57). The London Stage, 1660-1800, Part 2: 1700-1729, ed. Emmett L. Avery, 2 vols. (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1960); Part 1: 1660-1700, ed. William Van Lennep, Emmett L. Avery, and Arthur H. Scouten (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1965). Surviving evidence records performances of twenty-one Shakespeare plays or adaptations of Shakespeare plays in the fifteen years from January 1700 through 1714. Just seven of the plays were performed "straight": Cymbeline, Hamlet, 1 Henry IV, Julius Caesar, Merry Wives of Windsor, Othello, and Henry VIII. Six of these are in Geduld's list (the exception being Merry Wives )—but Hamlet, 1 Henry IV, Julius Caesar, and Othello were readily available in recent, separate quarto editions, so there was probably no urgent need to issue them in 1714. (There is no evidence of a separate edition of Henry VIII until Tonson published one in 1732.) The fourteen adaptations performed in these years were Caius Marius (Otway's Romeo and Juliet ), The Comical Gallant (Dennis's The Merry Wives of Windsor ), The Injured Princess (Durfey's Cymbeline ), Granville's The Jew of Venice, Tate's King Lear, Love Betray'd (Burnaby's Twelfth Night ), Davenant's Macbeth, Gildon's Measure for Measure, Cibber's Richard III, Sauny the Scott (Lacy's The Taming of the Shrew ), Davenant, Dryden, and Shadwell's operatic Tempest of 1674, Shadwell's Timon of Athens, Ravenscroft's Titus Andronicus , and Dryden's Troilus and Cressida. All fourteen were readily available in their own quarto editions and twelve of them are duly listed in Mears's play catalogue of 1713 (discussed below). 12 12. Mears simply lists all known published plays by title (with an attribution when he can supply one). He is meticulous in distinguishing adaptations from Shakespeare originals, though he does not seem to have realized that Macbeth had been significantly tampered with, and he unaccountably omits Cibber's Richard III. Publishing the original Shakespeare text by way of comparison might make sense, but probably not for sale in the theatres—though eleven of them are in Geduld's list. Six of the plays Geduld includes are not known to have been performed at all between 1660 and 1714, either straight or adapted: All's Well that Ends Well, Antony and Cleopatra, As You Like It, King John, Love's Labour's Lost, and The Winter's Tale. 13 13. Geduld may have believed that Dryden's Antony and Cleopatra play, All for Love, was an adaptation of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, but it is not. The idea that Tonson would have "produced especially for sale at the theatres" stage editions of plays that had not been performed since before the theatres were closed in 1642 is ludicrous. A seventh play, Romeo and Juliet, was performed in both straight and adapted form circa 1663 but found no real favor on the stage until Otway used it in 1679 as the basis for his Caius Marius, a highly popular play that went through eight separate London editions before the source play enjoyed separate publication in 1734. One glaring omission from Geduld's list is The Tempest. Shakespeare's play was adapted by Davenant and Dryden in 1667 (pub. 1670) and then further revamped (probably by Thomas Shadwell) as a semi-opera in 1674. In this form it proved one of the most popular theatrical entertainments of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Indeed, Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume conclude that, based on "fragmentary performance records, The Tempest was the most popular work on the London stage prior to The Beggar's Opera in 1728." 14 14. John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus (1708), ed. Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume (London: The Society for Theatre Research, 1987), p. 74, n. 218. The Tempest would have been very near— if not at—the top of the "must include" list of anyone wishing to publish "stage versions" of Shakespeare plays in order to profit from performance-generated interest, though of course Shakespeare's play was very different from what was being performed in the theatre. Thomas Johnson, a publisher of English books in The Hague, recognized the appeal of The Tempest and understood that he could profit by publishing an edition of the adaptation, which he did in 1710. Unlike Johnson, Tonson actually owned the copyright to this work and had published an edition of it in 1701. If we inquire into the logic of a publisher wanting to issue separate editions of single "Shakespeare" plays, we will do well to start by remembering that booksellers published plays to make money. However foreign the idea is to modern scholars, in the early eighteenth century many of "Shakespeare's" most popular plays were in fact adaptations (many of them radical adaptations) , a fact proved beyond argument by the performance calendar. To capitalize on the theatrical success of those plays with stage editions of the sort that Geduld claimed Tonson issued in 1714, a publisher would do far better to issue a mixture of unaltered and adapted plays rather than exclusively to publish straight Shakespeare texts. This is, in fact, exactly what one progressive publisher chose to do. Between 1711 and 1718, Thomas Johnson produced the first ever "greatest hits" collection of English plays, a twelve-volume set that included forty-eight plays. 15 15. For a list of "Collected Editions of Plays, 1604-1720," see Kewes, Appendix B. Volumes 1 and 2 of Johnson's A Collection of the Best English Plays were devoted to Shakespeare plays and adaptations. The first volume (1711) contains four unaltered Shakespeare tragedies: Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Hamlet , and Othello. The second (1712) contains a mixture of straight and adapted Shakespeare comedies: 1 Henry IV, The Merry Wives of Windsor, the Davenant-Dryden-Shadwell Tempest (of 1674) and Granville's The Jew of Venice (a 1701 version of The Merchant of Venice ). Johnson also published a fifth Shakespeare adaptation, Shadwell's Timon of Athens, in the eleventh volume (1712). Operating in Holland, Johnson was not subject to English copyright law and was free to publish any play he could get his hands on. While genre considerations seem to have been on Johnson's mind, he also appears to have been aware of the importance of publishing plays that were popular in the theatres—a consideration that outweighed any concern he may have had regarding the importance of publishing "pure" Shakespeare. Some of his books are noteworthy for their textual accuracy, but in all likelihood , he had no concern whatever for attributional purity. That Tonson did not issue twenty-five Shakespeare "separates" in any format in 1714 now seems clear beyond reasonable doubt. We may usefully ask, however, whether he could legally have done so even if he had wanted to —an issue that Geduld never raises. Tonson was, technically at least, bound by English copyright law and the rules of his trade, and consequently he could not legally publish works he did not own. And as surprising as this assertion may be, Tonson did not own the publication rights to some of Shakespeare's most important and popular plays. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the right to publish Shakespeare's collected dramatic works seems to have derived from ownership of a preponderance of Shakespeare's individual plays. (Scholars have yet to determine how many plays constituted a "preponderance" in this context.) In what remains the standard discussion of Shakespeare copyright during this period, Giles E. Dawson concludes that while "Separate plays and groups of plays passed from hand to hand by sale and bequest . . . only the ownership of a large number of these entitled a man to initiate the publication of a collected edition." 16 16. Giles E. Dawson, "The Copyright of Shakespeare's Dramatic Works," in Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild, ed. Charles T. Prouty (Columbia, MO: Univ. of Missouri Press, 1946), pp. 9-35, at p. 23. The Tonson firm owned the copyright to enough of Shakespeare's plays to publish the 1709 collected edition and its successors throughout the first half of the eighteenth century. But in 1714 Tonson did not own the copyrights to some important and extremely popular Shakespeare plays, including Hamlet, Julius Caesar, and Othello. Tonson did hold the rights to the adaptations of Macbeth and The Tempest —certainly the ones to own in the early eighteenth century from the point-of-view of turning a profit—but not to the original versions. Tonson's ownership of many of the copyrights aside, he did not, in fact, publish a single unaltered Shakespeare play during the fifteen-year period under consideration. Indeed, the only single Shakespeare editions he published from 1700 through 1714 were of theatrically successful adaptations. Ford records fourteen unaltered and altered Shakespeare plays published in twenty-one single editions in London in this span of years. 17 17. These were Otway's Caius Marius (1703), Dennis's Comical Gallant (1702), Hamlet (three editions in 1703), 1 Henry IV (1700), Granville's Jew of Venice (1701), Tate's King Lear ( ca. 1702, 1712), Burnaby's Love Betray'd [from Twelfth Night ] (1703), Davenant's Macbeth (two editions in 1710), Gildon's Measure for Measure (1700), Othello (1705), Cibber's Richard III (1700), Lacy's Sauny the Scott (1708, 1714), the Davenant-Dryden-Shadwell operatic Tempest (1701), and Shadwell's Timon of Athens (1703, two editions ca. 1709). All of them were in the current repertory at the time of publication. Of these twenty-one editions, Tonson published only three: one of the 1670 DavenantDrvden version of The Tempest in 1701 and two of the Davenant version of Macbeth in 1710. 18 18. In 1712 Tonson also published the bilingual text of the Italian opera L'Ambleto/ Hamlet (Italian words by Apostolo Zeno, music by Francesco Gasparini), which we exclude from this discussion. Tonson published all three editions in quarto. More prominent than Tonson among publishers of single Shakespeare plays and adaptations during this period was Richard Wellington, who published eight of the twenty-one editions listed in note 17. 19 19. For the best discussion of Wellington and his Shakespeare copyrights, see Terry Belanger, "Tonson, Wellington and the Shakespeare Copyrights," in Studies in the Book Trade in Honour of Graham Pollard (Oxford: Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1975), pp. 195-209. Wellington was a long-time friend and associate of Tonson who owned outright the copyright to Hamlet and Othello, and who owned at least a controlling interest in 1 Henry IV. He published three editions of Hamlet in 1703; one of 1 Henry IV in 1700, and one of Othello in 1705. 20 20. The 1700 edition of 1 Henry IV has often been described as an adaptation by Betterton , but it is in fact merely cut a bit for performance. See Judith Milhous, "Thomas Betterton's Playwriting," Bulletin of the New York Public Library, 77 (1974): 375-392. He also owned the copyright to Otway's Caius Marius and to Tate's King Lear, publishing a single edition of the former in 1703 and two editions of the latter circa 1702 and in 1712. All eight editions were published in quarto, not octavo. For reasons of legality, professionalism, and friendship, Tonson is extremely unlikely to have violated Wellington's rights in these plays. The apparent non-existence of the alleged separates seems to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Tonson neither pirated the books nor leased the rights to them. This conclusion prompts us to correct another series of erroneous assertions by Geduld. Near the end of his chapter on Tonson and Shakespeare, Geduld claims that the publisher issued the first separate texts of The Comedy of Errors (1734), King Henry VIII (1714, 1732, 1734), Two Gentlemen of Verona (1734), and The Winter's Tale (1714, 1735). Eleven of the plays he published separately were the first untampered texts to appear in place of the more familiar adaptations. Four others, were the first to be issued separately after the quartos. (147-148) The four "others" Geduld identifies in a note as " Love's Labour's Lost, 1714 and 1735, A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1692, 1693, 1714, 1734, Much Ado About Nothing, 1734, Pericles, 1734." As we have demonstrated, however, Henry VIII, The Winter's Tale, Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, and Pericles were not separately published in 1714. We must also point out that the 1692 and 1693 single editions of A Midsummer Night's Dream Geduld refers to are actually editions of The Fairy-Queen, the anonymous operatic adaptation of Shakespeare's original with music by Henry Purcell. Even more troubling is Geduld's statement in his note 38: "Seven of the apocryphal plays taken over from the Chetwynd Folio, 1664, were published separately in 1709 and 1728, and in collected form, one volume duodecimo, in 1728" (226). In 1664, the London bookseller Philip Chetwind reissued the Third Folio with seven additional " Shakespeare " plays: The History of Sir John Oldcastle, The Life of Thomas Lord Cromwell, The London Prodigal, Locrine, The Puritan, Pericles, and A Yorkshire Tragedy. 21 21. See Don-John Dugas, "Philip Chetwind and the Shakespeare Third Folio," Harvard Library Bulletin, n.s. 14 (2003): 29-46. Only Pericles is now considered to be Shakespeare's. Geduld asserts that Tonson published single editions of these plays in 1709 and 1728. Not only does this oddly contradict Geduld's usual insistence on 1714, but it reveals a staggering indifference to the logic of commerce. These were obscure, nearly forgotten plays. Pericles was performed with some success in 1660, 22 22. See Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, pp. 43-45. but no record of performance after the first decade of the seventeenth century survives for any of the others, and neither had any of them been adapted for performance after the reopening of the theatres in 1660. None of these alleged 1709 or 1728 separates can be found in Sturges, Ford, or Papali. The ESTC records three copies of The Puritan excerpted from an unidentified play collection published in 1709. These were not, however, published singly and neither were they published by Tonson. Geduld is correct in saying that the apocrypha were published in a collected, duodecimo edition in 1728. This was issued as a ninth, supplemental volume to the second Alexander Pope edition of The Works of Shakespeare, published as an eight-volume set by Tonson. Tonson, along with J. Darby, A. Bettesworth, and F. Clay, published the apocrypha "in Trust for Richard, James, and Bethel Wellington"—the heirs of Richard Wellington, who died in 1715. The Tonson firm did not publish single editions of the apocrypha until 1734-1735.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Price of the Tonson Editions If we stop to think about the matter, publishing single editions of Shakespeare plays in 1714 would have been a very odd thing for Tonson to do. Tonson was a great and cultured publisher, but also a hard-headed businessman . Why would he publish a multi-volume edition of the complete works and then undercut its sales by issuing numerous individual titles in direct competition with himself? All the most popular plays were already available in quarto editions, whether straight or adapted. Publishing separate editions of unpopular plays would have done the sales of the collected edition of 1714 no good at all. But if logic tells us that Tonson would have been a fool to issue whatever single plays he had (or could get) rights to, it also tells us that another publisher might have seen possibilities in this situation. Granting the complexities of rights to books at this time, one might expect some attempt to capitalize on Shakespeare. 23 23. As a loose parallel almost a century earlier, we would point to the ten "Pavier quartos" of Shakespeare published circa 1619 (some of them falsely dated). On this "rather shady" and ultimately "abortive" scheme, see W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio (Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1955), pp. 9-16. For a recent reconsideration of the Pavier enterprise as an attempt to exploit a market gap, see Andrew Murphy, Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003), pp. 36-41. At this juncture we need to confront a serious and longstanding misconception . Writing in 1971 Kathleen M. Lynch stated that "The Fourth Folio text was rare and expensive, and it was highly desirable that readers should be able to purchase all of the plays in more convenient volumes and at moderate cost." 24 24. Jacob Tonson Kit-Cat Publisher (Knoxville: Univ. of Tennessee Press, 1971), p. 129. Tonson unquestionably increased the ready availability of Shakespeare's plays, but he did not make Shakespeare available cheaply in either of the two 1709 editions or the 1714 edition. 25 25. Tonson published two editions of Rowe's Shakespeare dated 1709, not one. He ordered his printer, John Watts, to make the second edition an exact copy of the first, perhaps so that Tonson's customers would not realize they were paying 30s for a second edition that was not so labeled in any way. Watts did such a good job that the second edition passed undetected for more than 200 years. See R. B. McKerrow, "Rowe's Shakespeare, `1709'," Times Literary Supplement, 8 March 1934, 168. Skimpy records suggest that the First Folio cost 15 s to £1 (depending on binding) when it appeared in 1623. The retail prices of its successors are not (so far as we are aware) known, but other seventeenth-century folio prices and auction records imply a price normally in the vicinity of £1. A First Folio sold as low as 8 s 6 d in 1687, and a Third as high as £1 8 s 6 d in 1678. Fourth Folios sold between 16 s and 18 s in the late 1680s. Sale prices in the first two decades of the eighteenth century are reported at £1 6 s (First) and £1 2 s 6 d (Fourth). 26 26. See Anthony James West, The Shakespeare First Folio: The History of the Book, vol. 1 (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2001), pp. 16-19, 79, 83. How readily a would-be buyer could locate a folio copy for sale we do not know, but in comparison with these prices the two 1709 octavo editions do not seem "moderate" in cost. The advertised price was 30 s, or 50% more than the average cost of a folio. 27 27. Advertisement in the Daily Courant, 6 June 1709. The first serious challenge to the idea that the 1709 edition was readily affordable was issued by Robert D. Hume, "Before the Bard: `Shakespeare' in Early Eighteenth-Century London," ELH, 64 (1997): 41-75 at 51. While Murphy quotes and endorses this argument, his statement that the edition of 1709 cost "just" 50% more than the price of a folio edition (p. 62) suggests that he may not fully have understood its implications. These editions were not intended to bring Shakespeare to the masses. The idea that the 1714 duodecimo edition was a cheap popular reprint is likewise fallacious. Ford, followed by many scholars (among them Geduld, Bate, and Murphy), presumed that this edition was inexpensive, and hence that it reached "a wide reading public" (as Bate phrases the point): "Tonson, possibly taking into account the Shakespeare plays published at The Hague in 1710 which found their way here, and recognizing a further outlet for the sale of the works in a more convenient and less expensive form to a play-going and reading clientele, thereon produced a second [really third] edition in duodecimo in 1714" (Ford, 3). It seems, however, to have sold for about 27 s, which is 3 s less than the 1709 editions, but still 35% more than the average cost of a folio. 28 28. Ford, p. 15, reports advertised prices of £1 7 s 10 d and £1 7 s in 1715. Edmund Curll's A Catalogue of Books "For the Year 1714" lists under "Books printed with an Elzevir Letter in Pocket Volumes" an entry for " Shakespear 's Works complete, 9 Volumes, 1 10 0." 29 29. An exemplar of this catalogue may be found at the end of A Poem on the Death of Our Most Gracious Sovereign Queen Anne (1715) by George, Lord Bishop of Bristol (British Library 12301.b.12). We are indebted to Professor Paul D. Cannan for calling our attention to this source. The nine-volume version of the edition (the third issue in Ford's enumeration) comprises Tonson's eight-volume edition of 1714 to which are added the poems and critical essays by Gildon that constitute the additional "Volume 7" of the 1709 edition of plays produced by Curll in a uniform format and published in 1710. With the supplementary material the price had returned to 30 shillings. The 1714 multi-volume set seems unlikely to have found its way into a lot of bourgeois homes. At this time the average income of educated people was little more than 20 s a week. 30 30. See "Natural and Politicall Observations and Conclusions upon the State &amp; Condition of England," in Two Tracts by Gregory King, ed. George E. Barnett (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1936), p. 31. Prices changed relatively little in England between 1688 and 1715. Ford says in an oft-quoted phrase that "some copies . . . turn up marked specifically for `The Housekeeper's Room' " (4), but we doubt that many of the gentry indulged their servants with such a purchase. Even at 27 s we are looking at a sum well above the average weekly income of a bourgeois household—a bargain price per play for forty-three plays (apocrypha included), but still a very costly purchase. The idea that Tonson had brought Shakespeare to the masses is simply fallacious. Single plays were normally priced at 1 s or occasionally 1 s 6 d and hence much more readily affordable. An enterprising publisher with no stake in keeping the price of the collected edition inflated might well have seen a potential market for Shakespeare issued in single play form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mears's Advertisement of 1715 Evidence that such a possibility did not go unremarked does exist, though to date scholars have overlooked its significance. Investigation of this evidence will help us understand why Shakespeare's plays were not systematically issued in separate editions until the 1730s. In 1713 William Mears issued a sixteen-page quarto playlist: A True and Exact Catalogue of All the Plays That Were Ever Yet Printed in the English Tongue ([London:] Printed for W. Mears, 1713). 31 31. At the same time he issued a 48-page duodecimo version, reissued in 1714 with the playlist "continu'd down to April, 1714." The first page specifies that the list is "with the Authors Names against each Play (Alphabetically Digested) and continued down to October, 1713." Mears was to publish major continuations and elaborations of his catalogue in 1719 and 1726. Both lists have been widely used by bibliographers . 32 32. On three of the versions of Mears's playlist, see Carl J. Stratman, Dramatic Play Lists 1591-1963 (New York: New York Public Library, 1966), nos. 17, 19, and 20. Stratman does not mention the 16-page quarto version of 1713. What is germane to our subject here, however, is a single printed leaf continuing the 16-page version of the 1713 catalogue "to October, 1715." 33 33. We have used the British Library copy (shelfmark 11903.f.24). The ESTC records other exemplars at Oxford (John Johnson Collection and Bodleian Rawl.4° 141) and the University of Chicago. The existence of this "Continuation" was noted as long ago as 1925. See Clark Sutherland Northup, A Register of Bibliographies of the English Language and Literature (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1925), p. 139 (item 1880). Stratman quotes Northup's reference in a note to his entry no. 17, but he does not otherwise acknowledge the item. The recto continues the catalogue to October 1715, marking with an asterisk those " omitted in the other Catalogues; the others have been since Publish'd. " The verso advertises ninety-one titles available at Mears's shop, including some thirty-eight plays then thought to be by Shakespeare. (See figures 1 and 2.) They are described as " Plays Printed in 12mo in a neat Elzevir Letter, and Sold by W. Mears." Some had come into print or were about to do so. Mears published The Apparition; or The Sham Wedding ("by a gentleman of Ch. Ch. Oxon.") in 1714 and with others "Electra from the Greek" the same year. A number of the works listed were simply new plays from 1712-15 (e.g., Addison's Cato, the Cid translation, Philips's Distressed Mother, Hamilton's Doating Lovers, Rowe's Jane Shore and The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey ) routinely issued after their premières by various publishers, among them Tonson, Lintott , Burleigh, Brown, and Curll. Some titles represent recent duodecimo reprints of plays whose original quarto editions had duly been listed in the 1713 Catalogue (e.g., Betterton's The Amorous Widow, reprinted in the more modern format in 1714). The non-Shakespearean titles seem essentially unproblematical . The Shakespeare-related titles, in sharp contradistinction, are almost all extremely surprising and anything but unproblematical because with the exception of three well-known separates already published in quarto, none of the thirty-eight titles came into existence at this time. Table 1. "Shakespearean" plays listed in the Mears catalogue addendum of 1715. Plays are listed in the order he gives them; titles are given exactly as he presents them, but are printed in italics.

Insofar as one can determine from title alone, he was indicating original texts, not adaptations where they existed. This is a startling list. Mears includes thirty-eight "Shakespeare" titles (including the seven plays added to the 1664 re-issue of the Third Folio), thirty-four of which had never been separately published since 1660 (if ever) in anything like an authentic text. 34 34. The total of thirty-eight does not include Lacy's Sauney the Scott (listed by Mears as Sawney the Scot ), whose presence in the list may be coincidental. This version of The Taming of the Shrew (first performed 1667; first published 1698) remained popular on the stage after 1700. Only thirteen had appeared in adapted form, some of them almost unrecognizable in their new guises. The five non-apocryphal titles Mears omitted are Hamlet, Julius Caesar, The Tempest, Richard III, and Henry VIII. We have been unable to fathom the logic (if any) of the omissions. Neither copyright ownership nor current availability in original or adapted form makes sense of them. The first three plays were extremely popular and regularly reprinted (the third in radically adapted form). Richard III was readily available in print in Cibber's 1699 adaptation. Why Henry VIII was omitted we have no idea, since it had been performed with success but had never been separately printed. Of the thirty-eight plays in Mears's list, only Othello was readily available in straight form (having been many times reprinted, most recently in London in 1705). 35 35. Thomas Johnson issued a separate edition in The Hague in 1710. 1 Henry IV was made available in 1700 in a version reflecting some performance cuts. Macbeth had been published in straight form in 1673 (without an attributed author) but was regularly reprinted in the Davenant adaptation. Johnson published a straight edition of Merry Wives in The Hague in 1710, but how available that edition was in London is hard to guess. Given Mears's interest in drama and the wording of the advertisement on the verso of the 1715 addendum, one might infer he had published or intended to publish (or perhaps merely that he expected to distribute) the ninety-one titles listed. He was greatly interested in publishing and selling plays, and evidently featured drama in his shop. The 1715 catalogue continuation reads "Sold by W. Mears at the Lamb without Temple-Bar. Of whom may be had above five hundred several Sorts of Plays, in 4 to and 12 mo. " Many of the plays he had for sale were old quartos, as a look at the catalogue itself confirms . Most of the extant plays listed in the addendum were published by other booksellers, and analysis of Mears's output does not suggest that he could have put out thirty-eight plays in short order. Combing the ESTC for Mears's activity between 1710 (his first year as a journeyman) and 1730 we find that he published or was associated as seller with 385 titles, an average of some eighteen per annum. But over twenty-one years he published or co-published only about a quarter of that number, including forty-five plays. What then is the meaning of the 1715 addendum? The exact phrasing is " Plays Printed in 12mo in a neat Elzevir Letter, and Sold by W. Mears." This is open to misinterpretation because "Printed and sold by" was commonly employed on title-pages to designate a book's publisher(s). 36 36. For the long-standard discussion of imprint, see M. A. Shaaber, "The Meaning of the Imprint in Early Printed Books," The Library, 4th ser., 24, nos. 3-4 (September 1943March 1944), 120-141. For a very lucid discussion of "The Meaning of the Imprint" with particular reference to the early eighteenth century, see David Foxon, Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade, rev. and ed. James McLaverty (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991), pp. 1-12. But in this instance what is meant seems to be something like " Plays Printed [by W. Mears and Others] . . . and Sold by W. Mears." Where then did Mears imagine he was going to find the thirty-eight separates he apparently though he would be able to sell? Two possible hypotheses occur to us. Conceivably Mears, or someone else, or a consortium, believed that the requisite permissions could be obtained and separates published . These hypothetical venturers might have obtained some of the permissions , or thought they could, and then discovered that Wellington or Tonson (or the two together) had enough clout to get the permissions withheld or withdrawn. A variation on this scenario is that Mears might have thought he could circumvent the copyright/permission problem by collaborating with Thomas Johnson, who could legally do the printing. A London bookseller with the initials "B. L." may already have been selling some of Johnson's titles. 37 37. The name "Bernard Lintott" comes readily to mind, but conventional scholarly wisdom says that so major a figure in the London trade is unlikely so openly to have sold de facto piracies and hence that the imprint must be false or misleading. Whether Mears could also have sold imported books in defiance of his colleagues' rights in them is not clear, but we presume that if this was the strategy, Tonson and Wellington persuaded, threatened, or coerced Mears into dropping the scheme. Mears was (or was to become) a highly respectable bookseller, and there is a fair probability that he thought he could cut a deal with Tonson and other copyright holders and then discovered that in fact he could not. Alternatively, we wonder if Mears's plan was to acquire copies of Tonson's 1714 collected edition, break each volume up into its constituent plays, and then sell them as "separates"? Mears was not among the numerous booksellers named on various versions of the 1714 title-page and neither did he hold (so far as we know) interest in any of the Shakespeare copyrights. Such a scheme, however, would have had nothing to do with copyright since Mears would merely have been reselling bits of Tonson's edition of Shakespeare's plays. One can see why a publisher and bookseller would have wanted to get in on the Shakespeare bonanza circa 1715. Tonson had published two (actually three) editions of the playwright's collected dramatic works in just six years, and he changed the name of his shop, his sign, and the device printed on the title-pages of some of the books he published to "Shakespear's Head." Lintott, and Curll and Sanger brought out editions of Shakespeare's poems in parallel with Tonson's three editions of the plays. And in 1712 John Dennis published the first separately issued pamphlet-length work of criticism specifically devoted to Shakespeare, An Essay on the Genius and Writings of Shakespear. Interest in Shakespeare was running high. 38 38. For an important contribution to our understanding of the growth of critical interest in Shakespeare at this time, see Paul D. Cannan, "Early Shakespeare Criticism, Charles Gildon, and the Making of Shakespeare the Playwright-Poet," Modern Philology, 102 (2004): 35-55. The criticism written by Gildon to fill out the volume of Shakespeare's poems published by Curll as an addendum to the 1709 edition of plays has some claim to be considerd the first book-length work of Shakespearean criticism. Could Mears have made money by carving up copies of the 1714 Tonson edition? We doubt it. Tonson was selling forty-three plays for 27 s at a time when single plays usually retailed for 1 s or 1/6. But how many of those plays would have enjoyed good sales as single editions? By our reckoning, most book-buying play-goers in 1714 would have been interested in just five unaltered Shakespeare plays ( Hamlet, 1 Henry IV, Henry VIII, Julius Caesar, and Othello ) and seven popular adaptations whose titles were close enough to Shakespeare's originals to make corresponding identification easy ( King Lear, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, Merry Wives of Windsor, Richard III, The Tempest, and Timon of Athens ). For whatever reasons, as we have noted, Mears's list excludes five of these twelve ( Hamlet, Henry VIII, Julius Caesar, Richard III, and The Tempest ), leaving him with seven attractive titles and thirty-one rather obscure ones. Cherrypicking the saleable plays would probably have left him a depressing surplus of detritus in the form of All's Well that Ends Well, Locrine, and other drugs on the market. What Mears would have had to pay for copies of Tonson's edition to cannibalize we do not know, but unequal demand for the disjecta membra would almost undoubtedly have rendered such a scheme unprofitable. Did Mears actually attempt to carry out such a plan? We suspect not. The small number of surviving "extracts" from the 1714 collected edition suggests that no such scheme was ever put into effect. We must emphasize that almost all of the Shakespeare titles in Mears's list are chimerical. No such separate printings have ever turned up, and if the plan was to strip off bits of Tonson's 1714 edition, then we must presume that it was never carried out. Mears clearly saw an opportunity he was unable to capitalize on. What happened? We will probably never know for certain, but the books did not get published. 39 39. The fact that Mears co-distributed for Tonson Beaumont's The Prophetess (1716), Dryden's Dramatick Works (1717), Otway's Works (1717-18), and the 1719 editions of Julius Caesar suggests that the two did not have an irreparable falling out over Mears's failed Shakespeare project. The House of Tonson was a major publisher with many important books, but the ferocity with which the firm waged its war against Walker's attempt to print separate editions of the Shakespeare plays in the 1730s is notorious. 40 40. Ford, p. 41, comments that the firm of Tonson (managed by Jacob Tonson's nephew after 1720) employed "nearly every means short of actual murder" in its attempt to defend its rights to Shakespeare against Walker and other competitors. Whatever Mears's plan was in 1715, it came to naught. Tonson's editions of 1709 and 1714 did not make Shakespeare widely accessible to the general public. Copies were indeed readily available for sale, but at a price substantially higher than people had been paying for the seventeenth-century folios. The text was conveniently packaged, and Rowe had made the plays far more readable by regularizing and modernizing Shakespeare's spelling; by adding scene divisions and location indicators; by adding dramatis personae to the more than thirty plays that lacked them; by regularizing, correcting, and completing the dramatis personae of plays that did not; and by uniformly identifying characters within plays. 41 41. For Rowe's contributions as editor of Shakespeare, see Edward Wagenknecht, "The First Editor of Shakespeare," Colophon, pt. 8 (1931), unpaginated, and Peter Holland's introduction to the 1999 facsimile. But Tonson was charging a premium price for these improvements, as well as for the "cuts" (a portrait of Shakespeare and one engraving per play) he commissioned for the 1709 and 1714 editions. Ford's and Lynch's presumption that Tonson's editions were inexpensive and Geduld's erroneous assertion that most of the plays were made available as separates in 1714 (which has long gone unchallenged) no doubt contributed to the mistaken belief that the plays could be had cheaply. Separates would probably have sold decently, but Tonson clearly had no desire to undercut the sales of his pricey collected edition by making individual titles available in competition with himself. We may assume that he had even less desire to allow anyone else to do so. Tonson evidently saw Shakespeare as a premium product, saleable as a luxury rather than a popular item. His next such venture, the six-volume The Works of Shakespear edited by Pope (1723-25), was priced at a staggering six guineas (126 shillings) per set, which amounts to substantially more than a month's total income for Gregory King's average "persons" educated in the "Sciences and Liberal arts." Diluting the market for his 1714 edition with any more single titles than were already available was no part of Tonson's strategy. He did not issue a lot of separates until competition from Walker forced him to do so in the 1730s; when Mears got the bright idea of making individual titles available, Tonson (perhaps with cooperation from Wellington) must have put a stop to the scheme. The result was that much of the Shakespeare canon was to remain expensive and decidedly inaccessible to the general public for nearly two more decades. Scholars have failed to pay attention to the price of Tonson's 1709 and 1714 editions, and in consequence they have seriously misunderstood the nature of the first "modern" edition of Shakespeare, its circulation to the public, and its cultural impact. 42 42.

      <field name="heading_text">NEW LIGHT ON JOHN HOADLY AND HIS `POEMS SET TO MUSIC BY DR. GREENE'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">by H. Diack Johnstone</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was Keith Maslen who, in the pages of this journal, first drew attention to a small but nonetheless interesting volume of poems by John Hoadly (1711-76) which is now in the rare books collection of the University of Otago library and whose contents are said (on its front cover) to have been `Set to Music by Dr. Greene'. 1 1. `Dr. Hoadly's "Poems Set to Music by Dr. Greene" ', Studies in Bibliography, 48 (1995), 85-94. This consists partly of printed libretti (with autograph additions) and partly of libretti in the poet's own hand. As a musicologist long concerned with the wok of Maurice Greene (1696-1755), I was naturally intrigued, and in a companion piece published two years later I sought to fill in some of the musical background; 2 2. H. Diack Johnstone, `More on Dr. Hoadly's "Poems Set to Music by Dr. Greene" ', Studies in Bibliography, 50 (1997), 262-271. neither could I resist the temptation to speculate on what other Hoadly verse known to have been set by Greene might possibly have appeared in the now missing section of this volume. The two men had known each other well since 1730 at least, in which year Greene took a doctorate of music at Cambridge, and Hoadly, his junior by fifteen years, went up to Corpus Christi College (Cambridge) to read law. Shortly after he came down (in 1735) John Hoadly became a clergyman, chiefly, it is said, to avail himself of the rich patronage at his father's disposal. 3 3. See Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. His father was the celebrated Latitudinarian bishop Benjamin Hoadly, translated from Salisbury to Winchester in 1734. William Gibson's Enlightenment Prelate: Benjamin Hoadly, 1676-1761 (Cambridge, 2004) is the first ever book-length study of his life and work. He was also passionately interested in the theatre, and, already intimate with Hogarth, he later on—in the 1740s—became good friends with David Garrick and James (`Hermes') Harris as well. For Greene, he produced not only a great many song texts, but also the libretti for no fewer than five major works: two pastoral operas, two oratorios and a masque. In chronological order these are Florimel or Love's Revenge (1734), Jephtha (1737), The Choice of Hercules (1740), The Force of Truth (1743) and Phoebe (1747). 4 4. As listed here, the title of the first is that of the principal MS source of the music, a facsimile of which (with an introduction by H. Diack Johnstone) is included in the series Music for London Entertainment 1660-1800 (London, 1995). In the libretti as published, however, it is simply titled Love's Revenge. All dates are those of the work's composition, but the printed libretti of The Force of Truth and Phoebe came out one year later, in 1744 and 1748 respectively. The wordbooks were published anonymously, the first in no fewer than five editions, 5 5. The English Short Title Catalogue lists only four, but there were in fact two dated 1745, one with a London imprint, the other with no specified place of publication. Though I have hitherto supposed the edition printed by W. Greenville in Winchester to have been issued in 1737, the ESTC suggests otherwise; it now seems more likely to have been issued for a performance given at the Winchester Festival in 1768. That said, however, it is strange that the only two copies I have seen should contain identical handwritten cast lists for two performances which almost certainly took place some thirty years previously. and printed copies of all but The Choice of Hercules are to be found in the Otago source, where they are, in each case, provided with cast lists, and, for Florimel and Phoebe, a trio of dedicatory poems, all in the hand of John Hoadly himself. 6 6. For the cast lists and dedicatory poems, see the Maslen article cited in n. 1 above. An edition of Phoebe (ed. H. Diack Johnstone) is published as volume 82 in the series Musica Britannica (2004). An autograph copy of The Choice of Hercules (with cast list) is there too, its text written out no doubt because the printed version had not been issued separately, but was contained within A Miscellany of Lyric Poems, The Greatest Part Written for, and Performed in the Academy of Music, Held in the Apollo (London, 1740) where, incidentally, it is entitled `The Judgment of Hercules'. The Academy of Music at the Apollo was a semi-private music club founded by Greene seven or eight years earlier, and at which, as is evident from Hoadly's cast lists, all five works listed here had been performed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the two dedicatory poems which Hoadly inserted into the Otago copy of the Winchester editon of Love's Revenge, one (undated) is inscribed to Diana, Duchess of Bedford; the other, to James Harris, is dated 1743, and must have been designed to accompany a score of the work apparently sent to him by the librettist in the autumn of that year. 7 7. See the letters of 8 October and 5 November 1743 from Hoadly to Harris partially quoted in the postscript to my article of 1997 (p. 271). Diana, the youngest daughter of the 3rd Earl of Sunderland, married John, the 4th Duke of Bedford, in October 1731, and died on 27 September 1735. Hoadly wrote an Epithalamium on the occasion of their marriage , and there is a copy in British Library, Add. MS 35605, fols. 28 r -29 r (as also in a newly discovered manuscript to be considered a little on in this present essay). Also dating from 1743, and evidently intended for Harris himself to set, is an autograph copy of the libretto of the oratorio, The Song of Moses. There is a second autograph copy from the library of the Earl of Malmesbury now housed in the Hampshire County Record Office in Winchester, Hants., and this is the one actually sent by Hoadly to the prospective composer. In the event, Harris never got round to it, and Hoadly, many years later (in 1775), passed a copy to Garrick with the request that he send it on to Thomas Linley in Bath for consideration . It was not the elder Thomas Linley, however, but rather his gifted son (also Thomas), who finally set it to music—and by the time of its first performance (on 12 March 1777), Hoadly himself was dead. 8 8. A fine recording of the work (Hyperion, CDA67038) was issued in 1998, and a full score (ed. Peter Overbeck) was published by A-R Editions, Inc. (Madison, WI) two years later. For the text as sent to Harris by Hoadly in November 1743, see Donald Burrows and Rosemary Dunhill, eds., Music and Theatre in Handel's World: The Family Papers of James Harris, 1732-1780 (Oxford, 2002), pp. 1071-74. As for Love's Arti- fice, a masque based on an episode from Cervantes' Don Quixote (and also in Otago), that too was still unset in 1775. 9 9. See letter of 27 August 1775 from Hoadly to Garrick in The Private Correspondence of David Garrick With the Most Celebrated Persons of His Time, 2 vols. [ed. James Boaden] (London, 1831-32), vol. 2, p. 81. Nevertheless, as will shortly appear, there is some evidence to suggest that it had once been offered to, and probably turned down by, a former Greene pupil, the blind organist John Stanley (1712-86).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so things stood until the spring of 2004 when four volumes of John Hoadly MSS, largely autograph, suddenly appeared on the market, and were shortly afterwards acquired by the Bodleian Library, Oxford, where they are now catalogued as MSS Eng. d. 3623-26. 10 10. Blackwell's Rare Books, Catalogue B144 (item 228). I am grateful to my colleague, Dr Michael Burden of New College, for drawing this item to my attention, and to Mr John King of Blackwell's Rare Books for allowing me to examine it carefully prior to sale. It is the last of these (MS Eng. d. 3626) which is of particular interest in the present context. Not only does this volume contain the same seven works as appear in the Otago source (and in the same order too), but it (together with MS Eng. d. 3623) also includes autograph copies of most of those poems which, in my 1997 addendum to Maslen, I surmised might once have been included there. In the case of the first five works however—i.e., those texts set to music by Greene—it is only the title pages, cast lists and dedicatory verses which are in Hoadly's own hand; the lists of dramatis personae and the libretti themselves are the work of an amanuensis as yet unidentified, but quite possibly Elizabeth Hoadly, the poet's wife. The letter forms used are strikingly similar to those of her husband, and the texts are marked up in such a way (with single, double, and triple underlining) as to suggest they may perhaps have been intended as printer's copy. It may also be worth noting that the `The Choice of Hercules' is here undated but entitled `The Judgment of Hercules' (as it is in the 1740 print referred to above). With Love's Artifice (starting on fol. 76 r ), Hoadly himself takes over, and everything thereafter is in his hand. But whereas the Otago copy (also autograph) leaves blank the space after `Set to Musick by', that space is here filled in by `M r: Stanley'. According to a note later pencilled-in on fol. 84 v , there was once yet another copy signed `J. Hoadly' and dated 1744—and to that, the following memorandum had apparently been added: `This Mask was afterwards somewhat alter'd, and given to Mr. Stanley to set to Musick. J. H.'. 11 11. These alterations (mostly passages omitted) are duly noted on fols. 80 r , 80 v , 81 r , 82 r and 83 v . There is also a reference to `the Mask for M r . Stanley' in an unpublished letter of 19 July 1752 from Hoadly to his friend Richard Warner (Hampshire Record Office, MS 6M59/F9/1/17). Whether John Stanley actually considered the text and rejected it is anyone's guess; what is certain, however, is that no such piece has yet come to light (or is known to have been composed by him). 12 12. Though Stanley did compose an extended cantata entitled `The Choice of Hercules ' in the early 1730s, the words are not Hoadly's. The 1744 date too must remain slightly suspect given that Love's Revenge is here said (wrongly) to have been written in 1736 and set to music by Greene in 1737—and Jephtha to have been composed in 1739.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Between Love's Artifice and The Song of Moses (in a third autograph copy which Hoadly here declares to have been `compos'd for James Harris Esq re. but never set'), there stands an unfinished `Ode on the Origin of Musick' which, if we may believe what its author says of it (on fol. 86 r ), was designed as a text for Greene's 1730 Cambridge Mus.D. exercise, but had been abandoned `on M r. Pope's applying to Him [i.e., Greene], that his Ode on S t. Cecilia's Day might be perform'd on that Occasion'. Its first stanza will serve to illustrate the enviable facility and already quite polished style of the young nineteen-year-old poet:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harmonious Sisters, tunefull Throng, Who 'gainst the Syren's Musick strove, Who boast the Conquest of their Song, And of their Wings your Garlands wove; Forsake awhile your heav'nly Spring, And bless your bestlov'd Seat on Earth: Let Cam's wide shore with Echos ring. While in varied Notes Ye sing The Sounds whence Musick took her Birth. Let the mellow Flute complain When the fair Naiade sighs; Let the shrill Violin express her Cries, And how she ran From Lustfull Pan: And give the warbling Lute a dying Strain, To tell her Grief, and speak her Pain, When midst the Reeds she dies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mimetic possibilities of the last eight lines in particular are obvious, but the remaining five stanzas, much more narrowly focused on the tale of Pan and Syrinx, provide fewer opportunities for musical expression. From a note in John Hawkins' General History of the Science and Practice of Music (1776), 13 13. Modern facsimile reprint of the two-volume 1853 edition (New York, 1963), vol. 2, p. 879n. and from the fact that the text was specially altered and adapted by the poet for the occasion, it has always been assumed that it was Greene who took the initiative in approaching Pope. It now looks, however, as if things might actually have been the other way round. 14 14. The only setting of Pope's Ode on St Cecilia's Day in its original (1709) version was composed by William Walond as an exercise for the Oxford B.Mus. degree in 1759. The Greene setting (ed. H. Diack Johnstone) is published as volume 58 in the series Musica Britannica (1991).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From various bibliographical notes pencilled in by some early nineteenth-century owner of these four quarto volumes, quite possibly the poet's nephew, the Rev. Robert Hoadly-Ashe (1751-1826), it is clear that there were once no fewer than nine octavo volumes as well, some obviously containing yet more copies of some at least of those various extended Hoadly works already discussed. It may be that the Otago source was one of these, but if so, it certainly wasn't the one referred to in the annotations mentioned earlier, since the Otago copy of Love's Artifice is neither signed nor dated, and does not contain any of those later alterations noted in the marginalia to MS Eng. d. 3626. Someone else—just conceivably the poet's widow in extreme old age— also flagged most (though not all) of those several poems by Hoadly included in Robert Dodsley's six-volume Collection of Poems . . . by Several Hands (1748-58). 15 15. For a list of these, see my article in Studies in Bibliography 50, pp. 268-270 in particular. Hoadly's contributions to Dodsley's fifth volume (1758) were sent to the compiler by the poet himself; see letter of 18 October 1757 from Hoadly to Dodsley reproduced in W. P. Courtney, Dodsley's Collection of Poetry: Its Contents &amp; Contributors (London, 1910), pp. 102-103. By 1836, these same four volumes—presumably bound as they are now, in gilt-ruled sprinkled calf and numbered vols. I-IV on the spine bands—had passed into the hands of the well-known London bookseller Thomas Thorpe, who sold them on to Sir Thomas Phillipps as part of the largest single bulk-buying operation of that extraordinary bibliophile's manic career. On that one occasion, Phillipps bought no fewer than 1647 manuscripts at a knock-down price of £6,000. 16 16. For details, see A. N. L. Munby, Phillipps Studies no. 3: The Formation of the Phillipps Library up to the Year 1840 (Cambridge, 1954), pp. 80-86. Thorpe was then beset with financial difficulties, and Phillipps ruthlessly beat him down to half the estimated value of the collection. Thus the Hoadly volumes became MS 9406 in the Phillipps collection. They resurfaced (as lot 303) in a Sotheby's (Phillipps) sale of 19-22 June 1893, and again in 1903 when they were bought by Dobell for two guineas. Shortly afterwards, it would appear, they were acquired by one Samuel John Hoadly, who believed himself (wrongly as it happens) to have been a member of the Winchester branch of the family. 17 17. I am indebted to his granddaughter, Mrs. Sheila Hoadly Barker, for information about this final link in the chain of private owners.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a poet, John Hoadly is now remembered (if at all) solely for his verses written to be placed, one each, under the eight plates of Hogarth's Rake's Progress (1735); these were subsequently included in volume 5 of the Dodsley collection (1758), and there is a MS fair copy of them in volume I here (MS Eng. d. 3623, pp. 184-190). So too (on pp. 222-229) is Hoadly's 1737 (and author-approved) translation of Edward Holdsworth's `Muscipula, sive Kambromyomaxia' (`The Mouse-Trap'). But neither of these is autograph. The first two-thirds of volume I (pp. 1-257) were copied by the same person as copied the first five libretti (i.e., those set by Greene) in volume IV (see discussion of MS Eng. d. 3626 above). Hoadly himself takes over on p. 258 and thereafter continues uninterruptedly to p. 388 (with eight blank pages at the end). He also seems, at some later date—most probably in the mid1760s—to have gone back and made various alterations and additions to those neat fair copies contained in the earlier part of the volume. Included in the autograph section, and hitherto unknown, is a rather charming ` Sonnet in Spenser's Stanza' addressed `To D r Greene, on his setting to Musick the Sonnets of Spencer, [ sic ] and dedicating them to her Grace the Duchess of Newcastle':</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pious Bird along y e boundless Skies His aged Parent on his Back doth bear, With wreathed Neck he feeds him as he flies, And safe conducts Him to a Clime more fair. Noting herein his Love &amp; filial Care. So Thou, to Spenser's Genius near allied, Near as sweet Numbers to harmonious Air, Feedest his Fame, &amp; bearest Him beside To Her, so worthy to be Orpheus' Bride; (He, tunefull Master, charm'd y e dreary Coast, Nor Pluto's self his sweet Request denies;) To Her y e Graces' and y e Muses' Boast. Well may'st Thou on such Basis build thy Name, Sure as her Judgment &amp; thy Poet's Fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greene's setting of twenty-five of Spenser's Amoretti, composed in the summer of 1738 and published in the spring of the following year, is undoubtedly his finest achievement in the field of English solo song. Whether or not Hoadly was involved we do not know, but by a careful selection of poems, the autobiographical narrative of the original (1595) sonnet sequence is neatly preserved, and to that extent the collection may be viewed as a curious precursor of the later romantic song cycle. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Greene ever envisaged the consecutive performance of all twenty-five songs. 18 18. Six of the set are sung by Emma Kirkby on a CD disc ( Maurice Greene: Songs and Keyboard Works ) issued on the Columns Musica Oscura label in 1995.</field>

Famiano Strada (1572-1649), a Jesuit priest best known for his history of the protestant revolt in the Netherlands, De bello belgico, published in 1632-47. The source of the lines quoted by Hoadly is his Prolusiones Academicae, Oratoriae, Historicae, Poeticae (1617), p. 379. are also divided into two parts, the first (pp. 1-22) being described on its title-page as `Poems written while at School', the second (pp. 23-372) as `Poems on several Occasions'. The latter covers the period from 1729 to February 1746. From an autograph index at the end (pp. 375-388), as also from various alterations made to the fair copies in the earlier part of the volume, it might possibly be inferred that the poet once had publication in mind. I rather doubt it, however, since (as appears from his correspondence with Garrick and Richard Warner too) Hoadly the writer was clearly concerned to maintain his anonymity. Just as well, perhaps, as the juvenilia gets off to a rather bad start with a short poem on farting written `Extempore from the French, while at the House of Office ' and introduced by the following pair of lines from Henry Carey's Namby-Pamby [1725]. 20 20. A fanciful formation on the name of Ambrose Phillips, this is in fact the term's first appearance in print; for the complete poem see The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse, ed. Roger Lonsdale (Oxford, 1984), pp. 139-140.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Why anyone should wish to preserve such coarse schoolboy smut I cannot imagine, but there is worse to come in volume IV, a volume whose title page proclaims it to be a collection of `Poems for Musick'. Here (on fols. 94 v -95 v ) we encounter a fairly long lavatorial `Ode to St t. Cloacine by an Epicurean Philosopher: Set to Musick by y e most zealous of her Adorers Maurice Greene Mus: D r. '. The text, in Hoadly's hand, is dated 1745 at the end, and is laid out in cantata form, with three airs, each prefaced by a slab of what must obviously be recitative. Can it really be that Greene, as Organist and Composer of His Majesty's Chapel Royal, Master of the King's Musick, Organist of St Paul's Cathedral, and honorary Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge, actually set (and performed) such stuff, even in the privacy of some convivial (and no doubt very tipsy) all-male gathering? If so, it suggests a far greater degree of intimacy between composer and poet than one had previously assumed. In somewhat similar vein, but much less vulgar, is a five-verse `Ballad' headed `The humble Petition of an ancient Gentlewoman to y e worshipfull the Trustees for the College of Old Maids, to be founded by A. W. Spinster. 1746' (volume IV, fol. 131 r ). This too is said to have been set to music by Greene, but in neither case does the music survive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Also lost is Greene's setting of six cantatas entitled `The Trophy'. Written in 1746 in honour of the Duke of Cumberland on his triumphant return from Culloden, the words were printed by Dodsley in volume 3 of his Collection of Poems (1748), and the autograph is here in volume IV (MS Eng. d. 3626, fols. 102 v -109 r ). 21 21. Another patriotic response to the events of 1745 (but not set) is Hoadly's `Song for the New Year, 1746', also in volume IV (fols. 96 r -98 r ). The words of two other cantatas said to have been set by Greene and previously unknown are also included: one a three-fold set of recitative and aria pairs beginning `Cynthia display'd her silver Ray' and dated 1729, the other, seemingly composed in November 1747 `on the Birth Day of her Grace Mary Duchess of Leeds, lately brought to Bed of a Marquiss [ sic ] of Carmarthen' (fols. 99 v -100 v and 101 v -102 v respectively.) Likewise new are two songs, `Love in thy Youth; Fair Maid, be wise' and `Too late for Redress, &amp; too soon for my Ease' (on fols. 124 v -125 r ), plus two ballads in addition to the afore-mentioned `humble Petition': `The Nymphs around attending' (1737) and `The Syllabub. To Laetilla' (1740), beginning `Who can Laetilla's Skill withstand' (on fols. 127 r -128 r ). At the very end of the volume (fols. 136 r -137 r ) are two metricalised psalms, the first a version of Psalm 23 (`The Lord is my Shepherd, then what shall I need?') apparently set by Greene in 1744, the second (1745) a version of Psalm 137 beginning `Tost by the sedge Side Of Babel's hostile Tide'. And finally, a curious local yokel type of piece evidently written at Farnham (his father's country seat) in 1743; described (on fol. 93 v ) as an `Ode of Horace parodied', it is cast as a dialogue between `Bunney' and `Lunney', who are elsewhere identified as John Burnel, the `BP.'s fat Porter at Farnham Castle' and `his adored Dairy Woman M rs. Lunn'. 22 22. See duplicate copy (also autograph) in volume I, pp. 313-318; only in IV, however, is the piece said to have been set to music by Greene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For none of these, however, does the music survive. Greene's first volume of songs, entitled The Chaplet, was published anonymously in March 1738. That the words of one of the most popular items in that collection, `Fair Sally lov'd a bonny seaman', were by John Hoadly has long been known. 23 23. See the Gentleman's Magazine, April 1776, p. 165. The words were first printed (as `A Song By Mr. H.') in the October 1736 issue, and with Greene's music in volume 6 of The British Musical Miscellany [1736]. It was also available as a single half-sheet song under the title `The Bonny Seaman'. What we haven't known before is that Hoadly was responsible for the words of the other eleven songs as well. They are all simple strophic pieces, and all but two were also published separately, in single half-sheet editions and/or various popular songbooks, and sometimes (as with `Fair Sally') in advance of The Chaplet itself. One of those which did not succeed is `Hob's come home again', the last song in the book. In 47 verses of mummerset, it chronicles the adventures in London of Hob and his `Zister Zuzan', and is obviously a first cousin once removed to the Bunney and Lunney piece just mentioned. But a couple of songs clearly did make it into the charts. Front runner, with no fewer than thirteen editions in addition to its appearance in The Chaplet, is the `Scots Sang' beginning `Sweet Annie fra the sea beach came', its pseudo-vernacular text so stuffed with Scots words as to require a glossary printed after the last verse. 24 24. The glossary is there too in Hoadly's autograph copy of the text. The words of all twelve songs are in volume IV, fols. 109 r -124 r . Greene's setting of `Sweet Annie' and `Fair Sally' are both included on the CD cited in note 18 above. Only eighteenth-century editions are included in the figures given here, as also in the `Descriptive Catalogue' that forms part of my 1967 Oxford D.Phil. thesis entitled `The Life and Work of Maurice Greene (1696-1755)'. Astonishingly perhaps, the piece had, by the end of the century, become `so much naturalized as to pass for Scotish'—and as such it was included (anonymously) in the first book of George Thomson's Select Collection of Original Scotish Airs (Edinburgh, 1793) where it is decked out with `Introductory &amp; Concluding Symphonies &amp; Accompanyments for the Violin &amp; Piano Forte' by Ignace Pleyel. Not far behind (with eleven separate printings of the music) is another convivial piece entitled `Life is chequer'd'. Taken up by Smollett in The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle and there referred to as `The Boatswain's Whistle', the song was a great favourite with Commodore Trunnion and Tom Pipes, his ex-boatswain's mate, whenever they made merry together in taverns. 25 25. Vol. 1, pp. 18-19 in the first (1751) edition of the novel; modern Everyman edition, vol. 1, p. 12.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Also quite popular among the twelve songs in The Chaplet was one which begins `In vain the force of female arms' and is simply headed `Chloe' in both manuscript and print. Its words were first published anonymously (with Greene's music) in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1738. Somewhat later, and also addressed to Chloe, are two other Greene/Hoadly settings : `Chloe resolv'd' (1744), and `The Poet's Picture of his Love' (1745). The latter was shortly afterwards published (but with no mention of Hoadly as poet) in the second of Greene's two books of A Cantata and [ Four ] English Songs (1746), while the words of the former were subsequently included in the third volume of Dodsley's collection (where they are dated 1743). But again, what hasn't hitherto been evident is that the Chloe of the title was no mere Arcadian shepherdess, but the poet's wife, Elizabeth (née Ashe of Salisbury). 26 26. The identification is made by Hoadly himself in a note appended to each of two unset poems in volume I: `Chloe's Tucker of her own Work' (on p. 134), and `Chloe Slighted' (p. 144). The first is dated 1734, and is immediately followed by yet another copy of Hoadly's 1736 `Dedication of the Pastoral (Love's Revenge) to Her Grace Diana Duchess of Bedford', the second by a copy of `In vain the Force of female Arms'. Among several other Chloe-centered verses in volume I, only one, `To Chloe, written on my Birth Day, Oct r: 8. 1734', later found its way into print (in Dodsley volume 3). The couple were married on 10 February 1736, so the verses `On a Bay-Leaf pluck'd from Virgil's Tomb, near Naples' (and dated 1736 in Dodsley's volume 3) must almost certainly have been composed on honeymoon . 27 27. There is a manuscript copy (not autograph) also dated 1736 in volume I (pp. 202204) ; included here too are copies of several congratulatory verses sent to Hoadly on the occasion of his marriage. In the 1782 edition of Dodsley's Collection, this piece (like `The Trophy' and those other Hoadly verses grouped with it in volume 3) is attributed (wrongly) to his elder brother Benjamin, and these misattributions have been allowed to stand in the modern facsimile with introduction, notes and indices by Michael Suarez (London, 1997). Greene's next publication was a volume of Catches and Canons for Three and Four Voices. To which is added a Collection of Songs for Two and Three Voices With a Through Bass for the Harpsicord issued in December 1747. None of the catches or canons is of any interest in the present context, but three of the songs have words now known to be by Hoadly, and all were written for the annual Stepney Feast, the first (`Britain and Belgia joyn') in 1734, the second (`From Zembla's ever-icy plain') in 1735, and the third (`Great ruler of the restless waves') in 1736. 28 28. Autograph copies of all three (with dates) in volume IV, fols. 91 r -93 r . A fourth song for the Stepney Feast of 1733 (`Hail British Isle, of mighty fate') is also included in Greene's 1747 Collection, but whether Hoadly was responsible for this too does not appear. 29 29. The Stepney Feast is one of several minor eighteenth-century London charities about which almost nothing is known. It was held in the church of St Dunstan, Stepney, generally on a Saturday in March or April, and had as its object the raising of money for clothing poor boys, and the putting out of others as apprentices. There is a small portfolio of prints and cuttings in the Hackney (now Tower Hamlets) Public Library which suggests that it may have been a precursor of the much later `Cockney Feast'. It would appear that the link is with Hoadly rather than Greene, for it was at Henry Newcome's well-known school in Hackney that John Hoadly (and his brother) were educated (and so too the two Yorke brothers mentioned in n. 39).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like many other eighteenth-century clergymen, country parsons in particular , John Hoadly turned out reams of such neatly crafted but essentially anodyne verse, and, with a good classical education behind him, also a great many translations and parodies of such poets as Anacreon, Horace, Ovid and Virgil. 30 30. Apart from the so-called `Ode of Horace Parodied' (already mentioned), Greene set only one of these, a version of Anacreon's Ode VIII (`As I on purple tapestry lay'). Though the words were evidently written in 1729, Greene's song did not appear until 1745 when, as `Anacreon's Dream', it was included in A Cantata and Four English Songs. The eleven `Epigrams from Martial' dedicated to James Harris of Salisbury dated 1745 and printed in Dodsley's volume 5 are among the twenty `Epigrammata selecta' at the end of MS Eng. d. 3623. And like many other eighteenth-century poets too, most notably perhaps Pope, he was also much given to the writing of epistolary verses. There are several of these in volume I, and one of them, not dated, but clearly penned sometime in the early 1730s, is addressed to Dr. Greene. It begins with greetings sent to the composer's wife and three children (all named), and then goes on, in another 43 four-line stanzas, to describe, quite amusingly, an incident in which, on a recent coach journey across Salisbury Plain, Hoadly and a couple of cronies had been involved. Having stopped off to whet their whistles at Lord Arundel's place (just next to the ruins of Wardour Castle), they returned to their coach to find their driver blind drunk on his lordship's beer. On mounting the coach box, he got his feet caught up in the reins, fell off, and was run over by the carriage. The party thought him dead,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But when We'd dragged him on his Side Out of the Road, our nose descry'd He'd only piss-spew-shit-ify'd His Breeches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hero of the occasion, the man who got the coachman patched up and back on board and then drove them on to Salisbury, was their mutual friend Dr John Freke (1688-1756), to whom the coach evidently belonged. Freke was a well-known surgeon (like Hoadly's elder brother, Benjamin). He was also very keen on music, and was (with Greene until 1731) a member of the Academy of Vocal (later Ancient) Music. Daringly supportive of his friend, he is said to have maintained (in coffee-house conversation) that Greene `was as eminent in composition as Handel'. And this unguarded remark, passed on to Hogarth not long after, is also said to have provoked the following vigorous response: `That fellow Freke . . . is always shooting his bolt absurdly one way or another! Handel is a giant in music; Greene only a light Florimel kind of a composer'. 31 31. John Nichols, Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth, 3rd ed. (London, 1785), vol. 1, p. 87; also in John Nichols and George Steevens, The Genuine Works of Willam Hogarth, 3 vols. (London, 1808-17), vol. 1, p. 237.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hogarth was quite right of course. But Greene as a composer is by no means to be despised. And neither, for that matter, is Hoadly as poet (though no one, it seems, has yet given him any serious scholarly attention). What is rather curious about the contents of these two volumes is that, with the exception of the pastoral opera, Phoebe, written in 1747, and a dedicatory poem sent with a copy of that work to the Marchioness Grey, wife of his old friend, Philip Yorke (later 2nd Earl of Hardwicke), in 1749, as also one other piece not yet mentioned, they contain nothing later than February 1746. 32 32. For the poem (MS Eng. d. 3626, pp. 58-59), see Maslen, pp. 90-91. What, one wonders, did he produce during the remaining thirty years of his life? We have numerous letters to Garrick (and others) of course, but almost nothing in the way of verse, save, that is, for three items in Dodsley's fifth volume: a six-line poem in French, English and Latin entitled `Verses to be fixed on the Gate of the Louvre at Paris. 1751', together with an epilogue to Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I as acted by `Young Gentlemen at Mr. Newcome's School at Hackney' in 1748 and a `Prologue to Comus. Performed for the Benefit of the General Hospital at Bath, 1756; And spoken by Miss Morrison in the Character of a Lady of Fashion'. 33 33. The latter two are included in Pierre Danchin's monumental The Prologues and Epilogues of the Eighteenth Century, 6 vols. (Nancy and Paris, 1990-97); see vol. 5, pp. 555-556 and 283-284 respectively. Danchin, however, was unaware that both had previously been published by Dodsley. There are also two poems written in 1755 which survive among the Grenville papers in the British Library (Add. MS 57836, fols. 77 r -78 r ), but neither is of any real interest. To these may be added a Prologue to the Siege of Damascus (by John Hughes) dating from 1764, and one last Chloe-centred piece (`When Chloe tried her virgin fires') included in a letter of 8 February 1776 from Hoadly to Mrs Joseph Warton. 34 34. The first was written for a performance at the poet's old school in Hackney, and was printed by John Nichols in his Select Collection of Poems, 8 vols. (London 1780-82), vol. 8, pp. 152-153. It was in this same play that Hoadly himself, whilst still at school, had made his own dramatic debut as Phocyas. The letter, written just a few weeks before he died, is in Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Don. c. 75, fol. 88 v . I am indebted to Professor Roger Lonsdale for bringing both these sources to my attention. There is one further poem (apparently written in September 1775) which forms part of an undated letter from Hoadly to Philip Yorke (now Lord Hardwicke) in British Library, Add. MS 35612, fol. 327 r , also (in Add. MS 37683, fols. 24 r -25 r ) a curious ballad headed `False Knight outwitted' and almost certainly inspired by the appearance of Bishop Percy's Reliques in 1765. Presumably there was a good deal more in that long lost set of nine octavo volumes to which reference has earlier been made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though the emphasis here has been very much on those poems written for (or at any rate set by) Greene, Hoadly produced words for a couple of other composers as well. One was Joseph Kelway (c. 1702-82), who, as `M r. Kellaway', apparently set a five-movement cantata entitled `Venus and Adonis'. 35 35. The music does not survive, but there are two copies of the words: one (autograph) in volume IV (fols. 100 v -101 v ), where it is dated 1734, and the other (undated) in volume I, where it is said to have been `Set to Musick by M r. K'. Another was Greene's close friend Michael Christian Festing (1705-52), whose setting of `The Bird of Passage' was subsequently included in his A Collection of English Cantatas and Songs. Sung by M r . Beard at Ranelagh House [1750]. 36 36. The words were also printed by Dodsley where, as in the MS (vol. IV, fol. 132 r ), the piece is dated 1749. As set by Festing, however, the (presumably) original first verse has been replaced by two others. There was also John Ernest Galliard (c. 16871749) , whom Hoadly himself elsewhere describes as a `most genteel and knowing composer'. 37 37. In a letter of 10 September 1775 to Garrick ( Private Correspondence, vol. 2, p. 94). The words of their enormously popular song, `The Early Horn', were, he says, written `for Rich, in the Cambridge stage-coach, [in] 1731', and, in autograph, they are included here (vol. IV, fols. 133 r -134 v ) in their original dramatic context. This Hoadly explains as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">M r. Rich having two fine Scenes by Him, painted by Lambert, one of the Queen's Hermitage and the other of Merlin's Cave, in Richmond-Gardens, desired me to put together a few Words for Musick to introduce them: which were perform d soon after in the Royal Chace, set to Musick by M r. Galliard. 1731.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is to the first of these two scenes that `The Early Horn' properly belongs. It was to be another five years, however, before The Royal Chance; or, Merlin's Cave, a pantomime generally accredited to Edward Phillips, took the stage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unlike his elder brother Benjamin (1706-57), whose Suspicious Husband of 1747 quickly established itself as one of the favourite comedies of the century, John Hoadly cut no ice as a playwright. He was, however, something of an expert on the theatre, and Garrick's most recent biographers refer to him glowingly as `perhaps the best informed nonprofessional scholar of English drama, past and present'. 38 38. George Winchester Stone, Jr, and George M. Kahrl, David Garrick: A Critical Biography (Carbondale and Edwardsville, 1979), p. 107. He is known to have written the fifth act of James Miller's tragedy, Mahomet the Imposter (1744), and to have revised and completed George Lillo's Arden of Feversham (1759), but, until recently, it appeared that the only survivors among his own original works were those several libretti intended for musical setting and discussed in the earlier part of this article. Among the `Poems on several Occasions' of volume I (MS Eng. d. 3623) are a small handful of prologues and epilogues for plays performed by the boys at his old school in Hackney; 39 39. These include both prologue and epilogue for Rowe's Tamerlane and epilogues for Macbeth, Measure for Measure and The Fall of Saguntum, a tragedy by Philip Frowde (1727). The prologues to Macbeth and The Fall of Saguntum (also copied out here) were evidently written by Philip Yorke (who succeeded his father as 2nd Earl Hardwicke in 1764), while that to Measure for Measure was by his younger brother, Charles (later Attorney General, and subsequently Lord Chancellor). Only the prologue and epilogue to Tamerlane are included in Danchin, Prologues and Epilogues, where they are printed (vol. 3, pp. 210-212) from an anonymous copy in British Library Add. MS 37684; there is another copy of the prologue not known to Danchin in Add. MS 37683 (fols. 22 v -23 r ). also the prologue and epilogue to Mahomet together with a revised version of the prologue designed to be spoken at a Drury Lane benefit for Miller's widow on 24 November 1744. 40 40. There is another autograph copy of the original epilogue (which had evidently been sent to Richard Warner) in Hampshire Record Office, MS 6M59/F9/1/2(enc.). To these may now be added the two five-act historical tragedies and two comedies included in those recently acquired Bodleian volumes not yet mentioned: MSS Eng. d. 3624 and 3625. In the latter is an autograph copy of The Contrast, written jointly by John and Benjamin Hoadly, and first acted at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 30 April 1731. It was, however, withdrawn after three performances, seemingly at the insistence of their father, the bishop, who was concerned that his sons' authorship of the play, anonymously produced, should not be discovered. But all that is another story which needs must be deferred to some other occasion. 41 41.

      <field name="heading_text">WATERMARKS AND THE DETERMINATION OF FORMAT IN BRITISH PAPER, 1794- CIRCA 1830</field>
      <field name="fulltext">by B. J. McMullin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MY concern here is with British paper produced in what may be described as a `transitional' period, extending from 1794 to about 1830. That concern has been stimulated by the recent article by G. Thomas Tanselle, `The concept of format', 1 1. Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000), 67-115. and it is an interest in the relationship between the characteristics of various papers and the format of volumes in which they appear that underlies my observations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the bibliographer there are two major developments in the production of paper in Britain in the period under consideration which are of immediate relevance. One is the change, resulting from legislation which came into force in 1794, in the location of watermarks within the traditional hand-held mould. The other is the transition from hand-made paper (a process by which paper is produced, one sheet at a time, from hand-held moulds dipped into vats of stuff in suspension in tepid water) to machine-made (a process by which paper is produced by machine in a continuous web, to be cut into sheets of the required size at some subsequent stage).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I By the beginning of the 1790s much British paper (still all hand-made) was being produced in wove moulds, which had been gradually supplanting laid moulds from the late 1750s. Wove paper—made, it is assumed, by James Whatman snr.—appears to have been used for the first time in a British publication , John Baskerville's edition of Virgil's Bucolica, Georgica et Æneis, published in 1757 though the paper itself was presumably available as early as 1754. 2 2. Philip Gaskell, John Baskerville: a bibliography (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1959), no. 1. The volume is a quarto, which collates (ignoring the numerous cancellantia) π 2 a-b 2 A-3H 4 . Gaskell notes that `Work on the original edition was in hand by the beginning of 1754, when the first specimens and proposals were issued. The first twenty-eight sheets (A-2E) were printed on an unwatermarked wove paper, the remainder (2F-3H, π-b) on an unwatermarked laid paper. . . . The book was published in 1757, probably in April, over three years since it had been begun.' The use of wove paper had become the norm by the end of the century, even if the demand for laid paper was never to be eclipsed entirely. Not only were moulds increasingly wove; there was a tendency towards the use of moulds without watermarks. At all periods a certain proportion of hand-made paper—both laid and wove, and not always paper of the poorest quality—was produced without watermarks; for volumes printed on wove paper without watermarks it may therefore be impossible to determine their format, given the lack also of chain lines and especially in the likely absence of such alternative determinants as deckle/cut edges, point holes, press figures or sheet numbers. The dilemma for the modern bibliographer is, however, largely resolved by the paper-makers' adherence to the provisions of `An Act for repealing the duties on paper, pasteboard, millboard, scaleboard, and glazed paper; and for granting other duties in lieu thereof, (34 George III, c.20), which came into effect 5 April 1794. Among other things, it provided that British-made paper used for writing, drawing and printing (`first class' paper) was to be taxed at the rate of 2½d. per lb. For present purposes the key provision of the Act was that printed books—whether bound or unbound—were, on export, eligible for a drawback (a refund of part of the duty already paid) amounting to 2d. per lb., with the proviso that `any such printed books . . . shall have visible in the substance thereof a mark commonly called a Water Mark, of a date of the present year of our Lord in the following figures 1794, or in a like manner of some subsequent year of our Lord.' 3 3. Danby Pickering, The statutes at large, from Magna Charta to the end of the eleventh parliament of Great Britain, anno 1761. Continued, vol. 39 (Cambridge: By J. Archdeacon &amp; J. Burges, for J. Johnson, G. G. J. &amp; J. Robinson, and D. Ogilvy &amp; Co., London, 1794), pp. 459-488 (section 31, p. 476). The `or' in this provision of the Act of 1794 is ambiguous, with the result, it is sometimes maintained, either that some paper-makers misunderstood the requirement to use the current year or that it allowed them to continue using moulds dated `1794', thus saving themselves the bother of changing the date in their moulds at the beginning of the new year. 4 4. Presumably for similar reasons French paper-makers continued to include the year `1742', following the Arrêt du Conseil d'État du Roy of 18 September 1741. Indeed, Thomas Balston notes of the Whatman mills, the largest and most highly regarded paper-making concern in the country, that The watermark `J. Whatman, 1794' is found in so many books and letters of the period 1794-1800, and any other date is so rare, that it seems certain that it continued to be used for some years, a not uncommon procedure in paper making. . . . From that year [1801] the correct date seems to have been employed. 5 5. Thomas Balston, William Balston, paper maker, 1759-1849 (London: Methuen, 1954), p. 16 and n. 1. I refer to the `Whatman mills', being the Maidstone mills (Turkey, Poll and Loose) originally owned by the Whatman family but sold in 1794 to the Hollingworth brothers, who continued to use the Whatman name as a watermark. In addition, D. C. Coleman observes 6 6. D. C. Coleman, The British paper industry 1495-1860; a study in industrial growth (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), p. 166. that at most times wholesale stationers were willing to buy virtually all the paper that the paper-makers could produce, in the knowledge that, despite fluctuations in demand, they would soon be able to sell it in a market which was continuing to expand—in other words it is possible that a batch of paper could have remained in the stationer's warehouse for an indeterminate time. 7 7. In fact there were occasions when paper-merchants did refuse to accept paper. For example, there was a slump in 1801, and `A serious consequence of this slump was that large stocks of paper accumulated in the warehouses of the stationers, and they could no longer afford to buy everything the manufacturers offered them as they had done for many years.' And in September 1809 the paper-merchants Keys wrote to William Balston: `We will thank you not to send us any more of the Printing Royal until our present stock is lowered, which at present exceeds 1000 reams, nearer twelve hundred' (Balston, William Balston, pp. 23, 66). Hence (a) the date appearing in a sheet of paper (whether `1794' or some other year) cannot be taken as unequivocal evidence of the date of manufacture of the paper containing it, and (b) paper supplied for a particular job may have been made (and accurately dated) some years earlier than the date of printing. Nonetheless, despite the qualifications just adverted to, observation of the typical intervals between dates in title-page imprints and those appearing in the paper used by James Ballantyne in Edinburgh in printing the works of Sir Walter Scott suggests that by and large the paper was used within a year or two of its manufacture. It might also be noted that there was a `mechanical' reason why moulds were likely to incorporate a current date: a mould in regular use might need replacing in as little as six months, by one presumably bearing the current date. 8 8. Thomas Balston, James Whatman, father and son (London: Methuen, 1957), p. 60, reports that in the eight years 1780-87 James Whatman bought eighty pairs of new moulds for the six vats at Turkey and Loose Mills, an average of 1⅔ pairs per vat a year, or a life per mould of just over seven months. Broadly speaking, therefore, it can be asserted that the date found in British paper used for the printing of books in the years from 1794 is, after all, likely to be not far removed from the year of manufacture. The Act of 1794 was repealed in 1811 (51 George III, c.95), 9 9. The only reason offered in the Act of 1811, `An Act to explain and amend certain laws of excise respecting the duties on estates and goods sold by auction; the allowing dealers to roast their own coffee on certain conditions; and to the water mark of the year on paper intended for exportation', is expediency: `And whereas it is expedient to repeal the said recited clauses of the said act: be it therefore enacted, That the said recited clauses shall be and the same are hereby repealed' ( The statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 51 George III. 1811 [London: Printed by His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers ; and sold by J. Butterworth, 1811], pp. 294-296). meaning that there was henceforth no requirement that a date be included, but individual paper-makers continued to produce dated paper for some years beyond 1811, possibly until the time came to replace their vats and hand-held moulds by machines. 10 10. On the face of it there can be no reason to add a date to the mould if there is no requirement to do so; custom would seem to be the only explanation for the continued practice. For the purpose of claimng the drawback paper-makers placed the date close to the longer edge(s) of the mould, so that it would be visible close to the edge(s) of the resulting sheet and, ideally, visible in a margin of a printed leaf, though, truth to tell, the watermark has often enough to be read through the letterpress, particularly in volumes in octavo and smaller. What follows is a series of illustrations of the disposition of dates (and other watermarks) in paper made in wove moulds between 1794 and the 1820s. 11 11. The illustrations are intended to represent all sheets of dated hand-made wove paper, whatever the time of manufacture. All examples are identified by details of the publication and a note of the gathering/sheet in which the particular watermark is located, 12 12. While on occasion the watermark may not be found elsewhere in the volume, for the most part it will, and of course the incidence need not agree with that in other copies. with, where appropriate, brief comments on the volumes in which the particular examples have been found and more general observations suggested by the particular examples (the location of the copy from which the example is drawn is recorded in a footnote). First there are examples of the date being attached to a laid mould which also contains a watermark and countermark in the conventional positions, resulting in a sheet of paper such as that illustrated in figure 1, 13 13. Copy seen: Monash University, *SW 914.4 Y74S copy 1. which is found in: "A Lady" [Mary Julia Young], A sketch of modern France. In a series of letters to a lady of fashion. Written in the years 1796 and 1797, during a tour through France, ed. C. L. Moody (London: Printed for T. Cadell jun. and W. Davies, 1798), 8°: a 4 B-2K 8 2L 4 χ1, gathering F. This volume is a little unusual in that all the paper, whatever the watermark, is laid. Here the date `1794' is likely to be `genuine', in the sense of having been attached to the mould in that year, rather than the consequence of a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the provisions of the Act—i.e. gathering/sheet F appears to be the remnant of a paper used in an earlier publication. It is found in Monash copy 1 in gatherings F-H only and in copy 2 in gatherings R 2A 2D only; the major run of paper in both copies has the `fleur-de-lys/IV' accompanied by `97' in all four corners, while the final four gatherings (2H-2L) and the preliminary gathering (a) have a paper without watermarks except for `1796' in two corners. Whether the dates were added to existing moulds or not cannot be known, though the `1796' and `97' dates would imply not, I think, given that an undated mould would have been unlikely to survive in use for the two years beyond 1794. The `W' within the fleur- delys suggests that all but four sheets (if not all thirty-three) came from the same paper-maker, whose practice it was to follow the spirit of the Act. More frequently, however, dated laid moulds do not have watermarks in the traditional location(s)—i.e. in the centre of one half of the mould—and from my limited observation I can cite no instance of a laid mould with a maker's name in addition to the date. 14 14. Professor David Vander Meulen has drawn my attention to a style of dating laid paper which seems at odds with the presumed intention to have the date so placed in the sheet as to be visible in a bound volume. In the copy of John Hunter, A treatise on the venereal disease, 3rd ed. (London: Printed by W. Bulmer for G. and W. Nicol, 1810) in the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library at the University of Virginia, the paper is watermarked `fleur-de-lys/IV', and while there are no corner dates the date `1807' appears immediately below the countermark. This paper may also be compared with that illustrated in figure 7. As has already been noted, by the early 1790s much British paper was wove, and often enough without watermarks, thus lacking the traditional indicators of format. Hence the Act of 1794, in requiring the inclusion of a watermark, in the form, at a minimum, of a date, has provided the modern bibliographer with the means of undertaking the analysis of printed volumes, in particular the means of determining format. The Act had the effect of encouraging the migration of all watermarks (now increasingly paper-makers' names or initials) to the edges of the sheet, often accompanying the date. I am not aware, however, that there has been any systematic illustration of the form of watermarks in wove paper from around the turn of the century or their disposition within the sheet. 15 15. Alfred H. Shorter, Paper mills and paper makers in England, 1495-1800, Monumenta chartæ papyraceæ historiam illustrantia, 6 (Hilversum, Holland: Paper Publications Society, 1957), reproduces a number of dated watermarks, but never with any indication of where in the sheet they appear. But since a familiarity with the various patterns may be an aid in determining format (or in undertaking other forms of analysis), I have selected a number of examples from the period for illustration here. 16 16. I am greatly indebted to Kate Gondwana for converting my drawings to digital form. (It is likely that further patterns will be revealed with the use of a differently constructed sample.) Throughout I have illustrated the outer forme of the paper (not the imposed type); dotted lines represent folds, solid lines cuts. The watermark would be sewn or welded onto the mould in reverse so that it could be read in the finished sheet from the mould (or `right') side, and in some instances— depending on whether the watermark lay to the vatman's left or right on the mould—the watermark, though correctly placed in the illustration, would be read from the other side of the sheet from that shown and sometimes actually run in the opposite direction. To give some idea of the resulting location of watermarks within gatherings I have added type-pages to the sheet, using the signature `A' to represent sheets, regardless of how in fact signed, rather than the generally applicable `$' or the actual signature of the sheet from which the example is drawn. Particularly in the earliest years the date might be fairly crudely formed by a single wire, but thereafter it is usual to find a much finer open lettering, an approximation of which I have used throughout. The simplest way of meeting the requirements of the Act of 1794 was to place a single date at one corner of the mould. However, it is certainly commoner to find the date appearing twice (at diagonally opposite corners) or four times (at all corners). Often enough, the paper-maker's initials accompany one of the dates, as in figure 2: 17 17. Copy seen: Melbourne, Fanny Dyne copy, gathering Q. Walter Scott, The lay of the last minstrel, 4th ed. (London: Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, and A. Constable and Co. Edinburgh; by James Ballantyne &amp; Co. Edinburgh, 1806), T/B14Ag; 18 18. Since a number of the illustrations are from volumes of the works of Sir Walter Scott, I have given `T/B' citations—that is, references to entries in William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: a bibliographical history, 1796-1832 (New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 1998). The Scott examples are all drawn from the Poynton collection in the Baillieu Library, University of Melbourne, referred to here as `Melbourne'; since this collection is uncatalogued and there are multiple copies of most of the items, I have added an indication of provenance or binding in order to identify the particular copy. 8°: [A] 8 B-U 8 X 4 Y 2 . This sheet is another remnant, 19 19. Here in the sense of not being part of the main run used for the job; whether the `W S' paper was supplied by the paper merchant for this job or was surplus to the needs of another job going through the printing house I cannot say. found only in gathering/sheet Q in two of the three Melbourne copies; otherwise the paper is uniformly watermarked `D &amp; A C | 1805 | 1 [2]', gathering/sheet Q in the third copy being on the paper with the vat number `2'. (On vat numbers see further below.) Common, too, is to find the maker's full name plus date in one corner— see figure 3: 20 20. Copy seen: Melbourne, green straight-grained morocco copy.

This example also shows how part of the watermark may be lost in cutting, here at the head of A1, as it is in all gatherings/sheets in the copy examined, with nothing surviving beyond the `C'. In this publication the dates in the paper may suggest that the bibliographer should at least entertain the possibility that there was an interruption in the printing of the volume. Gatherings A-2C are watermarked `1802' (no maker's name); gatherings 2D-2G `1804' (no maker's name); gatherings π-e and 2H-2K in the way illustrated—that is, only the last three gatherings of the text and the six gatherings of the prelims (presumably printed last) are on the paper dated `1810'. Volume 2 collates π 2 A-2X 4 2Z 2 , and gatherings A-2A are watermarked `1802', 2B-2P `1804', with the `Dickinson 1810' paper in gatherings π and 2Q-2X only, thus implying that the two volumes were going through the press simultaneously. 21 21. A second Melbourne set has the same disposition of watermarked paper. In this instance the order of the dated papers within the volume provides a strong indicator of the progress of the work through the printing house, an incidental virtue which suggests that, where feasible, a precise record of the incidence of particular papers should be given for at least those volumes on dated paper. The `1804' paper is employed throughout for the octavo edition (in French and published concurrently with the two issue of the English edition), 22 22. Known only from the British Library copy, described at T/B53Ac. except that gathering e is on the `Dickinson | 1810' paper. On the basis of the paper one might therefore hazard that the printing of the French edition began when the English edition was well under way but that the French was finished first, though no doubt other explanations could be advanced, particularly as the papers may be different (T/B records the English edition as on Royal, the French on Demy). The value of dates as watermarks in providing clues to the progress of a work through the press may be further, and more amply, illustrated by Scott's nineteen-volume edition of The works of Jonathan Swift, commenced in mid 1808 and finally published 6 August 1814, nearly four years after the date originally projected. The progress of the work can be followed in Scott's letters, as well as in the volumes themselves—in printers' imprints, press figures and the form of signatures, but more obviously in the paper, where the dates are a ready guide to the breaks in production. Take, for example, volume 9, which collates π 4 A-2I 8 2K 4 (-2K4) *2L 8 *2M 4 *2N1. Most of the volume was worked off by 1809: gatherings/sheets A-2I are dated `1808', and 2K `1809'. It is clear from the asterisks that 2L-2N constitute an addition, while the date in the paper (`1813') suggests that the interval may well have been four years. 23 23. Todd and Bowden give a general account of the salient features of the volumes but have room to provide only a summary of the papers used. The progress of vol. 10 is discussed in B. J. McMullin, `Scott's Swift, 1814, Vol. X (T/B79Aa.10): James Ballantyne and George Ramsay', The Bibliotheck 23 (1998), 49-53. Other paper includes the maker's name and the mill name (plus the date), as in figure 4: 24 24. Copy seen: Melbourne, red morocco copy.

This gathering is the only one to contain the mill name; the remaining gatherings are watermarked `J WHATMAN | 1817 [1818, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1825]'; the sequence of dates is to be explained by the fact that the work was published in ten parts, the first 1 May 1819, the last 14 December 1826, before being issued in volume form. It would seem that the inclusion of a mill name was unusual: in the several hundred volumes of Scott in Melbourne 25 25. Confirmed by the records of paper in T/B. there is apparently only one other publication containing paper bearing a mill name (`J WHATMAN | TURKEY MILL | 1822'). 26 26. Turkey Mill is on the River Len, to the east of Maidstone (Kent). Perhaps a different sample would provide a different picture; for example, I have noticed `IVY MILL | 1812' as the watermark in all but one gathering in George Colman the Younger, Poetical vagaries (London: Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1814). 27 27. Copy seen: Monash University, *820.7 C635 A6/Po. The remaining sheet is from the same mill, watermarked ` PineSmith&amp;Allnutt | 1812'. Ivy Mill (ceased operation in 1924) was on the River Loose, to the south of Maidstone. For details see A. H. Shorter, `Paper mills in the Maidstone district—Part IV', The Paper-Maker 140.1 (1960), 58-65; reprinted in Alfred H. Shorter, Studies in the history of papermaking in Britain, ed. Richard L. Hills (Aldershot, Hampshire: Variorum, 1993), 245-251 (pp. 247-248). Yet other paper includes, in addition to the maker's name and date, a vat number, such as that illustrated in figure 5: 28 28.

The appearance of these numbers is explained by Balston: `When more than one vat was engaged in the making of a paper, FIGURE 1. Laid paper; watermark and countermark centred in half-sheets, and date in four corners. FIGURE 2. Wove paper; maker's initials and date in one corner, commonly with date also in the diagonal corner or in all corners. FIGURE 3. Wove paper; maker's full name and date in one corner. FIGURE 4.

Balston, William Balston, p. 164. By `countermark' Balston intends a mark (words, date etc.) other than a traditional pictorial mark; as `watermarks' Balston illustrates two versions of Post. The subject of vat numbers has escaped the notice of Labarre (E. J. Labarre, Dictionary and encyclopædia of paper and paper-making, 2nd ed. (Amsterdam: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger, 1952). Just as the range of press figures found in the work of a particular printing house will suggest the number of presses in that establishment so will the range of vat numbers suggest the number of vats in the particular paper-mill, though in both instances caution must be exercised in concluding that all—presses or vats—were always in use. For example, during a slump in demand in 1809 the paper-makers Keys commended Balston for having `discharged 3 [of his ten] Vats', 30 30. Letter from Keys, 11 September 1809, reproduced in Balston, William Balston, p. 67. which I take to mean that he had temporarily taken them out of commission. If the `M' preceding the date in this paper also stands for `Mavor' it is redundant, but the inclusion of the maker's name suggests that other paper of the period, with a watermark in the form `M1816' plus a vat number but no maker's name, 31 31. For example, in the third edition of the Tales, T/B79Ac. may well have also been made by Mavor. In all three Melbourne copies of volume 1 of this fourth edition the paper is a mixture of `MAVOR | M1816 | 5' and `MAVOR | M1817 | 6'. 32 32. The three sets at Melbourne agree in having cancel title leaves dated 1818 in all four volumes. This must be a re-issue of T/B98Ad (imprint dated 1817), since the two agree in press figures, but T/B records the watermark for 98Ad as `MAVOR &amp; Co | 1816'. More unusual is it to find the paper-maker's name in the middle of one long side, plus dates in one or more corners, as in figure 6: 33 33. Copy seen: Monash University, *820.5 A225 Z/Ad v.1.

The same paper is used throughout, except that what are presumably the last four gatherings to be printed (P Q b c) are on a paper watermarked simply `1802', the date appearing about a quarter of the way along a long edge—i.e. it appears in the inner margin of $2.7 in those four sheets in the copy seen. Occasionally sheets of wove paper contain an additional number the explanation for which is not obvious: in two publications there are sheets containing—as well as the watermark `W BALSTON | 1812'—a further number below a vat number, in the form `5 | 2022'. One of these publications is the fourth edition of Scott's Rokeby, 1813 (T/B64Af), 34 34. Copy seen: Melbourne, polished calf with gilt border. in which the additional number appears only in gathering/sheet T. The other is Richard Porson, Tracts and miscellaneous criticisms (London: Printed by Richard and Arthur Taylor, for Payne and Foss, 1815), 35 35. Copy seen: Monash University, *889 P838T. which collates [a] 4 b-g 8 [B] 8 C-2C 8 2D 4 and in which the additional number appears in gatherings/sheets B-S Z. At first sight the additional number suggests itself as a mill excise number. These numbers were first allocated in 1712, when a duty was imposed on paper; but by 1861, when the last remaining tax on paper was removed and the practice of allocating excise numbers abandoned, the number had reached only 694. 36 36. On excise numbers see A. H. Shorter, Paper making in the British Isles: an historical and geographical study (Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1971), pp. 122-123. Shorter reports that 694 `appears to have been the highest Number given by the Excise authorities to any paper or board mill in England and Wales between the years 1816 and 1851.' There are no extant records before 1816: they were destroyed under the provisions of the Public Record Office Act of 1877 (Shorter, p. 75). Alfred H. Shorter provides a possible clue to the interpretation of higher numbers when he reports that `Some mills which were founded after 1861 have long been known by a distinctive trade number which is obviously not of Excise origin; examples are Broad Dumers (888) and Withnell Fold (3009).' 37 37. A. H. Shorter, `The Excise numbers of paper mills in England and Wales', The Paper-Maker 135.6 (1958), 540-541; 136.1 (1958), 50-53; 136.2 (1958), 54-56; reprinted in Shorter, Studies on the history of papermaking, pp. 36-54 (p. 54). What I have not established is whether `trade numbers' were assumed before 1861, whether `2022' was a Balston trade number. Nor, it should be said, have I found a number below 695 as part of a watermark— i.e. I do not know whether excise numbers were in fact ever added to a mould. There is even the occasional wove paper with a maker's name (or initials) and a date in the traditional (pre-1794) positions of watermark and counter-mark , an arrangement quite surprising in emanating from a large mill (D. and A. Cowan) and in being so late (1806)—see figure 7: 38 38. Copy seen: Melbourne, ex Sion College. Joseph Strutt, Queenhoo-Hall, 4 vols (Edinburgh: Printed by James Ballantyne &amp; Co. for John Murray, London: and Archibald Constable &amp; Co.

The four volumes are all on the same paper, except that the cancellantia and preliminary leaves are on a paper in which the watermark appears to be `C S | 1806'. In the uniformity of its paper a publication of this extent is unusual in the output of James Ballantyne, though it should be allowed that the particular form of watermark may well obscure any number of vats (and moulds). Shorter reports that `All the available evidence as to the size of paper mills in England during this period [1701-1800] points to the conclusion that the small mill, equipped with only one or two vats, was typical.' 39 39. Shorter, Paper mills and paper makers, p. 69. He calculates that in 1800 there were just over 400 mills in England, 40 40. Shorter, Paper mills and paper makers, p. 72; one reckoning is 417, another 409. more than eighty per cent of which had only one vat; fifty-five had two vats, eight had three, three had four, and two had five. The two largest were both in the Maidstone district, the Whatman Turkey Mill and Clement Taylor's Upper Tovil Mill. 41 41. Shorter, Paper mills and paper makers, pp. 406-409 (Appendix J, `Examples of mills which had more than one vat in the eighteenth century'). Shorter notes that since most of the figures come from advertisements for the sale of mills there may be others, not offered for sale, which have escaped his notice. Numbers increased in the early years of the nineteenth century; among large establishments with known complements of vats were D &amp; A Cowan (eleven vats, 1808) 42 42. The vat number found in eleven of the nineteen volumes of Scott's edition of the Works of Swift, 1814 (T/B79Aa). and T. Balston (ten vats, 1811). 43 43. The vat number found in the thirteenth edition of Scott's Lay of the last minstrel, 1812 (T/B14At). The highest vat number that I have seen is `14', a single instance, found in gatherings/sheets A and B in some copies of volume 1 of Scott's edition of Swift, this volume printed by George Ramsay in Edinburgh. Elsewhere, in Ballantyne's printing of Scott, vat numbers of `10'-`12' are found, in paper dated `1811'-`1814'; 44 44. T/B64Ac, 64Ag, 79Aa and 82Aa, all confirmed in copies in Melbourne. it would seem that by the later date many of the largest paper mills were about to become mechanised, given that vat numbers did not, on the evidence of the paper used by Ballantyne, go any higher. Unfortunately none of this paper contains a maker's name, so that we cannot know who had such a large complement of vats. The fact that a maker's name was not included in some paper confirms that vat numbers (whether or not accompanied by the papermaker's name) were included in the watermark as a means of internal `quality control', of concern to the paper-maker only, in identifying the individual workman or team. 45 45. Just as, perhaps, press figures were included on printed sheets as a form of quality control, at the instance of the master printer. As stated at the outset, the underlying interest in this study has been in the determination of format, by implication of volumes printed on wove paper. For a worked example of using the evidence of watermarks for determining the format of a post-1793 volume printed on wove paper I have chosen Jonathan Swift, The works, new ed., ed. Thomas Sheridan, rev. John Nichols, 24 vols (London: Printed [by T. Bensley] for J. Johnson [and 23 others], 1803), vol. 11. 46 46. Monash University, *SW 820.5 S977 A1/Sh2, v. 11, copy 2. With a cut leaf measuring 155 × 95 mm it collates [A] 6 (A1+1) B-2H 6 2I 4 (2I3+1), 47 47. A1 and 2I4 are `self-ends' (i.e. they form the paste-downs); the two inserted leaves (A1+1 and 2I3+1) are blank, forming the free end-papers. suggesting that the format is likely to be 12°, 18° or 24°, but not 16°. There are press figures only on E6 r H4 r Q6 v X6 v 2D6 v —not enough to be useful for deriving format—and ploughing has removed all point holes, along with all deckles save for a trace at the foot of a few leaves. Watermarks, however, are sufficient to determine the format. Gathering A has no watermark, but from B to T (after which a different paper is used) `L MUNN' appears in CS3.4 (i.e. leaves 3.4 in gatherings C and S) and FIMP1.6, with `1801' in BEH3, DGK6, LOR1 and NQT4. On the basis of the distribution of the watermarks the volume may be identified as an eighteenmo, with a typical printed sheet arranged as in figure 8. Since the sheet was imposed in such a way as to produce three gatherings, actual signatures (B C D) are used for clarity, but in the illustration the sheet has been turned 180° from its actual orientation in gatherings B-D in this copy in order to show the effect that would result from inverting it. 48 48. In fact in K6 and O1 the mark is `8', presumably a vat number (it seems unlikely that the other three digits from `1801' have been dislodged). Two further variant patterns to that illustrated would be achieved by turning the paper over on its long axis, so that the date would appear in B3 and D6 and the maker's name in either C3.4 or C1.6. 49 49. The scheme used to impose the type-pages for this volume is unusual in that it was normal practice to have the deckle fall on the outer edge of the leaves in the first half of all gatherings—i.e. D is anomalous. For a consideration of imposition schemes used to produce eighteenmos in sixes—not all of them found in the contemporary printers' grammars—see Pamela E. Pryde, `Determining the format of British books of the second half of the eighteenth century gathered in sixes', Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin 23 (1999), 67-77. That the scheme derived from the evidence of the watermarks is correct is confirmed by a second, uncut, copy in the Monash collection, 50 50. Monash University, *SW 820.5 S977 A1/Sh2, v.11, copy 1. This copy is the basis for the collation given above (copy 2 lacks A6, blank). which exhibits these characteristics: a deckle on the outer edge of B1-3 and D4-6; a deckle at the foot of BCD1 3 4 6; a tear on the outer edge of B4-6, C1-6 and D1-3; a cut or a tear at all heads and at the foot of BCD2 5; point holes in the outer edge of B4 and B6. What this exercise has done is to show that the watermark evidence is sufficient of its own in determining format, that familiarity with the patterns of watermarking dated paper should enable the bibliographer to establish format independently of any other evidence—just as, of course, the patterns of watermaking pre-1794 wove paper may. Determining the format of a volume in hand on the basis of the disposition of dates and names in the paper may be achieved by reference to the illustrations. The process is to some extent circular, but the resulting determinations will, in my experience, withstand scrutiny, except that a single date in a gathering in a cut copy could just as well indicate a half (or quarter) sheet as a full sheet, though in such instances size and shape, as well as the number of leaves in a gathering, should be a good guide to the relationship between the original sheet and that portion of it represented by the gathering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The second development of the 1790s of obvious interest to the bibliographer is the beginning of the mechanization of the production of paper, a process initiated probably in 1796, by Louis Robert, at Essonnes, south of Paris. 51 51. For the history of paper-making by machine I have depended on R. H. Clapperton, The paper-making machine: its invention, evolution and development (Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1967). The realisation of Robert's ideas was achieved in Britain, financed in part by Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier, stationers and paper-makers of Huguenot descent, by whose name the paper-making machine is still known. The machine was perfected in 1807, when a patent was granted to the Fourdrinier brothers and John Gamble—`perfected' in the sense that modern Fourdriniers operate on the same principles, even if accompanied by numerous refinements and huge increases in scale. The machine comprises an endless moving wire screen onto which the stuff (or `pulp') is dribbled from the stuff chest (or `vat') via the breast box; 52 52. For illustrations of the 1807 Fourdrinier see Clapperton, pl. 14 (opp. p. 34) and p. 40. Philip Gaskell, A new introduction to bibliography (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 217, illustrates a Fourdrinier which he dates to about 1830, though Alistair G. Thomson ( The paper industry in Scotland 1590-1861 [Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1974], opp. p. 165), dates the same illustration to about 1850 (the illustration is reproduced from a publication of 1854). the paper is then wound up at the `dry end' of the machine to form a continuous reel (or `web'). Such paper is conventionally known as `machine-made'; but it is necessary here to consider briefly a distinct variety of machine-made known as `mould-made', which could be produced in one of two ways. The earlier way was the `chain-mould' method, 53 53. See Clapperton, ch. 5, `The chain-mould paper-making machine'. which comprised an endless belt of conventional moulds (and deckles), without the underlying wire screen, onto each of which a measured amount of stuff was poured. It is not certain, however , that any machine constructed along these lines was ever put into use commercially. The later way was to use a composite machine, combining chain-mould and Fourdrinier; 54 54. See Clapperton, ch. 7, `The chain-mould and Fourdrinier machines combined'. whereby conventional moulds could, when desired, be attached to the wire screen; with the moulds removed, the machine was then available again for producing a web. The moulds could be either laid or wove, but obviously the objective of the exercise was to mechanize the production of laid paper, since until 1825 only wove paper could be produced on the normal Fourdrinier. The continuing demand for laid paper was met rather by hand-mades, sheets produced by the traditional method of dipping mould and deckle into a vat of stuff, so that mould-mades may be regarded as little more than a historical curiosity. In any case, as far as the bibliographer can probably determine, there is nothing to distinguish a sheet of laid paper produced by either of the chain-mould methods from one produced by hand. A distinction, however, can tentatively be made between a sheet of wove paper produced on a Fourdrinier and one produced by hand. Before 1839 any sheet containing a watermark, whether or not it includes a date, must have been produced by hand, for it was not until that year that the dandy roll was first employed with a watermark design on its surface. 55 55. A laid dandy roll with watermark is illustrated in Gaskell, p. 218. As first employed on being patented in 1825 the dandy roll was no more than a roller with a laid finish passed over the surface of the web as it was being formed, its purpose being simply to press out more water. From 1828 dandies were also made with a wove finish, though without a watermark. Paper produced between 1825 and 1839 with a laid appearance but without a watermark was probably made by machine, an assumption which it may be possible to confirm by determining which side of the sheet the indentations from the dandy roll are in. Machine-made `laid' paper (i.e. that created with a dandy roll) differs from hand-made (and mould-made) laid paper by the fact that in machine-made the `chain lines' appear in, and the watermarks are read from, the side which was not in contact with the wire screen, the reverse of the procedure with hand-made. In hand-made paper the side which came in contact with the mould is described as the right (or `mould' or `wire') side, the other side the wrong (or `felt') side. With machine-made paper, however, the terms are reversed: according to Labarre, `the upper side is the `right' side, i.e., the side on which the couch-roll acts and not the wire'. 56 56. Labarre, s.v. `Right and wrong sides of paper (c)'. It is also of some bibliographical interest to note the methods by which the web was reduced to sheets of conventional sizes. In the period preceding the introduction of dandies bearing watermarks the web might simply be drawn across a table and cut to the length desired. After 1839 the web might be `cut to register', a process whereby the circumference of the dandy corresponded with the length of the shorter edge of the intended sheet, so that the watermark would appear in a consistent position in the resulting sheets. Unless the sides of the paper can be distinguished it may not be possible to tell a laid hand-made sheet from one cut to register from a web. Conversely paper with a watermark appearing in a varying position within the sheet— as in modern superior paper (variously, and often misleadingly, described) used both for printing and for writing—must be machine-made. It may be impossible to determine whether the wove paper without watermarks used in a British book printed in the early nineteenth century is hand- or machine-made, but an uncut copy may help in the determination. The hand-made sheet will have deckles on all four edges, whereas the machine-made will have either three or four cut edges, depending on how the web was reduced to sheets. The remaining edge (either a shorter or a longer) will exhibit what may be called `deckle strap thinning', created by the stuff seeping under the deckle straps (the revolving leather straps which confine the stuff to the wire screen) 57 57. Deckle straps are clearly visible in many illustrations in Clapperton. and resulting in a deckle characteristically more uniform than the deckle edge created in a sheet of hand-made paper. Though it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish a thinning from a tear, viewing the edge against a light should identify a thinning. Of course cut edges may also result from producing a sheet of the required dimensions from, for example, a double sheet. Nonetheless, whatever the difficulties, it may be worth examining the edges of an uncut copy in attempting to determine format or in undertaking other varieties of analysis. If James Ballantyne in Edinburgh is typical of major printers elsewhere in Britain machine-made paper was not in widespread use in substantial bookwork until about 1820, but by the mid-1820s the transition from handmade was practically complete. In other words, and discounting the small amount of laid paper still being used, up to about 1820 paper used in bookwork was usually wove with a watermark (i.e. hand-made), but from the mid1820s it was mostly wove without (i.e. machine-made) 58 58. The evidence for Ballantyne is a combination of (a) the descriptions in T/B and (b) an examination of items in the Melbourne collection. Thus, in printing the works of Sir Walter Scott, Ballantyne appears to have first used machine-made paper in 1819, for the Novels and tales (T/B269Aa, published December 1819) and the Poetical works (T/B262A, January 1820), both in twelve volumes; thereafter some works are on hand-mades, others on machine-mades, but beginning with Woodstock (T/B190A, April 1826) all the major works are on machine-mades exclusively. This transition within Ballantyne's printing-house parallels the transition within the British paper-making industry : 1824 was the first year in which the output of machine-made paper exceeded the output of hand-made, 14,459 to 12,750 tons. The progress of the transition (and the increase in production) can be gauged by the figures for 1840 (33,463 to 9,937) and for 1860 (95,971 to 3,839). 59 59. Shorter, Paper mills and paper makers, p. 109. Shorter also notes that `The peak year in the yield of hand-made paper in the United Kingdom was 1805, when 16,502 tons were produced, against 557 tons of machine-made paper.' Wove paper was considered preferable to laid because of its greater smoothness and uniformity, and machine-made paper was ready for shipping in five days, rather than five weeks for hand-made. In 1806 the Fourdrinier brothers estimated the annual cost of operating a seven-vat hand mill at £2,604.12s., as against the cost of operating an equivalent machine at £734.12s.; at the same time the cost per hundredweight of making paper by hand was reckoned to be 16s., as against 3s.9d. by machine. 60 60. Richard L. Hills, Papermaking in Britain 1488-1988 (London: Athlone Press, 1988), p. 104. These advantages notwithstanding, paper-makers were slow to install Fourdriniers. Clapperton notes that `Owing to the want of enterprise among the paper-makers, and the opposition of the trade to the introduction of machinery, the business did not at first progress rapidly.' However, we should not overlook the expense involved in acquiring and installing a machine. In March 1808 William Balston was quoted £1500 by the Fourdrinier brothers for a machine capable of producing the equivalent of eight vats, with an annual licence fee of £380. 61 61. Balston, William Balston, p. 52. Despite the assurance that installation of a machine would save him £1000 a year Balston chose to retain his vats. According to Bryan Donkin's `Prospectus of the patent machine for making of wove paper, 1813' 62 62. Reprinted as Appendix 1 (pp. 255-258) in Clapperton, The paper-making machine. even the smallest machine, a mere thirty inches between the deckle straps and producing the equivalent of three or four vats, cost £715 if driven by straps, £750 if driven by wheels, with an annual licence fee of £200 (three vats) or £300 (four vats); Donkin's licence fee for an eight-vat machine was £940 or £980. In other words the slowness of implementation may well have been due to the capital costs involved, not necessarily to any dissatisfaction with the machine itself or to any hostility to the principle of mechanisation. Estimates of the number of machines installed in the 1820s and '30s vary (one estimate for 1837 is that 105 machines were then in operation, another 279); by 1842 there were 356 machines and 372 traditional vats, with the machines calculated as on average equating with five vats. 63 63. Coleman, The British paper industry, p. 198. As can be seen from the figures already quoted, by 1860 hand-made accounted for under four per cent of the paper produced in Britain. 64 64. Coleman, The British paper industry, pp. 205-206. Though published volumes are generally printed throughout either on hand-made paper or on machine-made, that homogeneity almost certainly is merely a reflexion of the paper-merchant's supply, not a desire for uniformity on the part of the printer. Indeed, some volumes were printed on a mixture of papers, apparently indicating an indifference within the trade. The three volumes of Scott's Quentin Durward, an octavo, published 20 May 1823, 65 65. T/B167A, `Watermarks: seldom in volume 1; irregular thereafter.' provide a convenient example. One set, 66 66. Melbourne, `McKelvie &amp; Sons, Greenock' binding. which differs only in the odd sheet from other sets in the Melbourne collection and so may tentatively be taken as representative of the edition as a whole, is predominantly without watermarks , but thirteen of the twenty full gatherings/sheets in volume 2 and six of the twenty-two in volume 3 do have watermarks. Hence of the sixty-two sheets making up the three volumes nineteen are clearly hand-made. That at least some of the remaining forty-three are machine-made is confirmed by the occasional presence of a seam mark, a mark in the paper produced by the seam joining the two ends of the wire screen on a Fourdrinier. 67 67. A further discussion of seam marks and cut vs. deckle edges will be found in my `Seam marks and bibliographical analysis', forthcoming. That all forty-three sheets without watermarks are machine-made, derived from a web, is suggested by the patterns of cut and deckle edges—for example, in the three uncut sets of Quentin Durward in the Melbourne collection the fore edge of $1-4 in the sheets without watermarks is invariably cut, whereas those sheets with a watermark invariably have a deckle edge in that position (i.e. those sheets with a watermark were produced in a traditional hand-held mould). From copies which have been cut this degree of certainty cannot be arrived at: it will not be possible to distinguish sheets produced by hand in moulds without watermarks from sheets produced by machine in a web, also without watermarks. In the transitional period (and specifically in the years around 1820), therefore, it is possible that three sorts of paper may be found in the one volume. As a counter to the suggestion of indifference just made is the curious case of the eighth edition of Scott's Waverley (published, according to Lockhart , in an edition of 2000 in April 1821), 68 68. John Gibson Lockhart, Memoirs of the life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., 7 vols (Edinburgh : Robert Cadell; London: John Murray and Whittaker &amp; Co., 1837-38), vol. 3, p. 296. of which there are two issues; 69 69. T/B77Ak (`Watermarks: None except for the beginning of volume 2: 1819 | 2.') and 77Al (`Watermarks: none. ') copies of both are in the Melbourne collection. Pace Todd and Bowden, all three volumes of 77Ak are watermarked `1819 | 2', whereas 77Al has no watermarks at all; that the paper in 77Al is at least in part machine-made is again demonstrated by the presence of an occasional seam mark, though the paper is palpably not uniform. 77Al is distinguished from 77Ak in having `†' in the direction line of $1 r , but the two agree in press figures, demonstrating that they were printed in one continuous run (Todd and Bowden mistakenly regard the latter as a reimpression). The siglum clearly serves to distinguish the two issues, but why would the printer (anonymous) or the publisher (Constable, in Edinburgh) wish to make a distinction between hand-made (or watermarked) and machine-made (or without watermarks)? Were the two papers considered as of different qualities (and therefore sold at different prices)? 70 70. In fact there is a handful of instances of (i) variant press figures, (ii) a `wrong' sheet being bound up, (iii) a `wrong' paper bearing the siglum, and (iv) a `right' paper lacking the siglum. Such exceptions are commonly found in editions comprising issues on two or more qualities of paper—see, for example, B. J. McMullin, `Paper-quality marks and the Oxford bible press 1682-1717', The Library 6th ser., 6 (1984), 39-49. —Lockhart makes no distinction. The change from hand- to machine-made paper corresponds also with the transition from printing with a hand-press to printing with a machine, and perhaps it could be claimed that it was the development in printing technology which encouraged the transition in the process of paper-making by increasing the demand for it. 71 71. Though printing from the web, rather than from sheets, was possible as early as 1813 the process was not applied to bookwork before the 1860s—see Gaskell, A new introduction , p. 263. In Ballantyne's printing-house the two changes do indeed run in parallel. From a Scott letter it appears likely that Ballantyne introduced machines (how operated is uncertain—perhaps manually) in 1823, 72 72. Nan Jaboor and B. J. McMullin, James Ballantyne and press figures, with a checklist of volumes printed by James Ballantyne (1803-1833), Monash Occasional Papers in Librarianship, Recordkeeping and Bibliography, 4 (Melbourne: Ancora Press, 1994), pp. 7-8. and Jane Millgate reports that two steam-powered machines were acquired in early 1830 for use in printing the magnum edition of Scott's collected works; 73 73. Jane Millgate, Scott's last edition: a study in publishing history (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univ. Press, 1987), pp. 35, 38-39. over that seven- or eight-year period the transition—both in paper-making and in printing (the latter reflected in the abandonment of press figures)—was complete. The widespread adoption of machine-made paper by the end of the 1820s may be just one element in the transition in book production from the hand-press period to the machine-press, but for the bibliographer it is the element which most emphatically marks that transition. To return to my original concern: the determination of format in British books printed on locally-made paper in the 30-odd years from 1794. Until 1811 much of the paper used for printing was hand-made, containing a watermark comprising a date and often other elements, and the practice of dating paper was continued well beyond that date, seemingly as long as paper was being made by hand in a mould. Uncut volumes on dated paper should readily reveal their origins in a hand-held mould, and hence their format. Cut volumes on dated paper may be less revealing; nonetheless the illustrations presented here suggest that a familiarity with the patterns of placing watermarks on moulds from 1794 onwards should enable the bibliographer to determine the format of such volumes. However, over the course of the 1820s there is a clear decline in the capacity to determine the format of the volume in hand, given that by 1830 the volume may well be among the majority printed on machine-made wove paper without watermarks of any kind and cut in the process of edition binding, thereby removing all the supplementary evidence which might have been brought to bear on the task, notably the original edges of the sheet. From this decade onwards alternative sources of evidence will need to be sought if the bibliographer is to determine the format of the volume in hand.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">BEGUN in the late 1960s, "The Writings of James Fenimore Cooper" (www. wjfc.org) is a critical scholarly edition subscribing to the guidelines of the Modern Language Association Center for Scholarly Editions (and to those of its predecessor, the Center for Editions of American Authors.) As editorial policy, the Cooper Edition (CE henceforth) has followed a conservative interpretation of the prevailing theory and practice used to edit American fiction in the last half century. Specifically, CE has subscribed to the rationale of Walter Greg, as practiced in the editing of nineteenth-century American texts by Fredson Bowers, G. Thomas Tanselle, and others, by invoking the crucial importance of the "author's final intentions"—identifying and preserving what the editors believe the author finally intended for every aspect of the form and substance of the work at hand. As evidence of Cooper's final intentions, CE has taken holograph witnesses (extant authorial manuscripts and revisions) as well as variants which collateral evidence (based on Cooper's known practices in the extant holograph revisions) suggests are likely to be authorial. CE scholarly texts are thus eclectic: CE editors chose variants they judge to be authorial from texts subsequent to the copy-text to create a text ideally embodying Cooper's final intentions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the 1980s, these governing procedures for CE practice concerning the authority of final intentions, especially the distinctions between accidentals and substantives, were strongly challenged. Cultural and language theorists, from the New Critics through the post-modernists, had questioned on social and psychological grounds the capacity of individual authors to exercise full autonomy and control over their texts. Such theorists argued that overpowering relationships to other authors, to readers, to broad cultural movements and constraints, and to the body of language itself demanded a revision of the assumption that authors consciously understood and controlled "final intentions " in their works. Jerome J. McGann's A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1983) brought these arguments home to the editorial community by showing from Byron's oeuvre and elsewhere that authors (especially poets) often produced multiple versions of texts for different occasions. Further, McGann argued forcefully that authors submitting manuscripts to compositors expected and often welcomed their interventions to perfect intentions indifferently realized in the manuscript delivered for composition. McGann's demonstration that Byron expected professionals in the printing shop or friends copying his manuscripts to normalize lapses and inconsistencies in his spelling and grammer rendered the concept of identifying and following authorial final intentions deeply problematic. 1 1.

Thomas Tanselle, "The Varieties of Scholarly Editing," and Joel Myerson, "Colonial and Nineteenth-Century American Literature," in Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research, ed. D. C.

      <field name="fulltext">This essay approaches the still-continuing debate about final intentions in the belief that the argument is best engaged not with theories or generalities but by illuminating the discussion through examining what is known about the practice of a specific author. My aim here is to examine these questions of final intentions and of the role of authorial collaborators through reviewing what we have learned about Cooper in the course of editing the twenty volumes of "The Writings of James Fenimore Cooper." Cooper did not set out as an author consciously to enlist collaborators, in the printing shop or elsewhere. Rather, through hard-won experience in seeing his manuscrripts through the press, he came to realize and value the roles compositors and others inevitably played in getting his words before the public. His challenge was to understand these roles and then to supervise, as closely as circumstances permitted, the inevitable limited collaborations that ensued. The issues are: How and where did collaborators (licensed and otherwise) succeed—or fail—in realizing Cooper's final intentions for his works? More specifically for editorial purposes, when manuscripts of Cooper's work in his own hand are extant, should CE scholars use as copy-texts such holograph witnesses? Or should they turn to first editions for which Cooper is known to have read proof and which may benefit from the improvements of his collaborators?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cooper and His Copyists Fortunately for Cooper editors, Cooper in one invaluable letter briefly overcame his customary reluctance to discuss his processes of composition. When responding on 12 April 1835 to a flattering request from the then Princess Victoria for an autograph of his work, Cooper wrote to the intermediary Aaron Vail (U.S. chargé d'affairs in London) that he chose to honor the princess' request by present[ing] myself to Her Royal Highness, republican as I am, in my working clothes. In other words I send a rough manuscript precisely as it was written, and which contains a chapter of the Bravo [published in London in 1831]. The work in question was written in this manner by myself and then copied by a secretary [his nephew William and his wife Susan and daughter Susan all apparently served in this capacity]. The copy was corrected again by myself, and then it passed into the hands of the printers. The sheets were subjected to another correction, and the result was the book. Now it is more than probable that the work will differ materially from this manuscript, but they who take the trouble to compare them will have an opportunity of getting an insight into the secrets of authorship. 2 2. The Letters and Journals of James Fenimore Cooper, ed. James Franklin Beard, 6 vols. Cambridge: Belknap Press of the Harvard Univ. Press, 1960-68). Future citations to this edition will be cited as L&amp;J immediately following the reference in my text. The present source is L&amp;J, 3.144-145; italics are mine. The work of several Cooper editors (see especially James P. Elliott, The Prairie, and Thomas and Marianne Philbrick, The Red Rover ) confirms the broad lineaments of Cooper's description here of his habitual practice of writing , proofing, and publishing in the 1830s and beyond. Two points concerning his disclosures about his inscribing the text, collaborating with an amanuensis , and overseeing the resulting corrected copy through the press, need to be made more explicit. First is the role of the amanuensis. Cooper indicated to Vail that he corrected the fair copy before it passed "into the hands of the printers." But he does not state that he made such corrections against the original manuscript itself. Doubtless in the commerce of his family circle he easily could have responded to queries from his copyists about passages they had difficulties with; but without a zealous comparison of their version with his original, he would not have caught plausible substitutions his copyists made, consciously or by accident. Thus the amanuensis fair copy represents a close collaboration of author and family members, but one that, in the absence of a careful comparison with the original, began the process of introducing variants into those final intentions Cooper had expressed when he completed the manuscript. As was his practice, first with his nephew William and later with his wife and daughter, while traveling in Europe (1826 to 1833), Cooper preferred to have someone in his family circle make a fair copy for the press of his own first draft. Cooper, as we shall see, had problems enough with the New York printers who set the six novels (through Last of the Mohicans ) which he published before leaving for Europe and which established his early fame. But at least with the New York printers and publishers, he had the benefit of personal associations and frequent visits to the city. However, for the seven new novels and Notions of the Americans written during the European sojourn , he had to endure printing and publishing variously in Paris, Dresden, Florence, and London. Cooper doubtless decided that the necessity of entrusting to non- English-reading printers the setting of his manuscripts made it prudent to oversee the re-copying of the original by someone who could unpack his own dense and crabbed writing into a script easier for compositors new to his hand to set proof from. Early and late, Cooper's handwriting is difficult. Writing with paternal advice to his son Paul on 9 November 1843, Cooper urged him to "attend to your hand-writing. I am a living proof of the importance of such an accomplishment" ( L&amp;J, 4.426). After Cooper began journeying in earnest on the Continent, attendance in person at the printing shop became inconvenient (though he continued insisting on reading and returning proofs); providing a fair-copy manuscript to foreign printers became all the more worth the extra labor. Apparently anticipating the need for a confidential amanuensis while abroad, Cooper had made arrangements for his brother William's son, William Yeardly Cooper (1809-1831), to accompany the family in Europe. William faithfully carried out the copyist duties for Prairie, Red Rover, Water-Witch, and part of Bravo until his terminal illness and untimely death on 1 October 1831, after which Cooper's wife Susan and daughter Susan assumed the duties of copyists. Cooper subsequently tried unsuccessfully to persuade his niece Elizabeth Caroline DeLancey to join the Coopers in Europe to take on William's tasks ( L&amp;J, 2.159). Only one chapter, a late one not in William's hand, survives of the amanuensis copy of Bravo, but the CE scholarly texts of Prairie and Red Rover (both 1827) and The Water-Witch (1830; in preparation) disclose William's practices as collaborator with his uncle. James P. Elliott has studied William's role in detail in his 1985 edition of Prairie, the Cooper title with the most material, in more varied forms, available for critical editing. Eliott's analysis substantiates Cooper's 1835 comments to Aaron Vail concerning his practices of composition. The extant witnesses for Prairie demonstrate that Cooper lightly revised his manuscript, presumably before William's recopying. In his copying , William made numerous small changes, doubtless both intentional and from misreadings. William guessed at words he could not read (Cooper's "deserted swale" becomes "detested swell" in William's version); he dropped phrases and simplified or made parallel phrases and constructions; and he often imposed his own grammar and pointing, altering his uncle's characteristic rhetorical pacing. 3 3. See the Textual Commentary to The Prairie: A Tale, ed. James P. Elliott (Albany: SUNY Press, 1985), especially pp. 394-397. Further, when he admitted defeat in reading an authorial word or phrase, William left a blank—for which often as not, his uncle, when revising William's copy, provided wording different from the original manuscript. In short, while William's fair and large hand made the labors of the Paris printers of the novel far easier than Cooper's would have, he made many small changes in accidentals and substantives that found their way into the first and subsequent editions. Thomas and Marianne Philbrick, the editors of the CE text The Red Rover, for which William's amanuensis copy survives, report very similar findings about William's practices as copyist. They identify 740 substantive variants introduced by the amanuensis, of which Cooper caught almost half (360) and restored his holograph final intentions. But for 380 other readings, William's version passed into the first edition and persisted until critical editorial scrutiny caught such errors as William's "stopping," "resumed," "superiors," "rain," and "accompanied" for, respectively, the author's " stooping ," "returned," "seniors," "vain," and "unaccompanied." 4 4. See the Textual Commentary to The Red Rover: A Tale, ed. Thomas and Marianne Philbrick (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991), especially pp. 466-470. Only (as Cooper rightly speculated to Vail) when the diligent CE editor became one of those "who take the trouble to compare them" (the various witnesses) did we gain "an insight into the secrets of authorship" in terms of Cooper's collaborations with his amanuensis ( L&amp;J, 3.145). The second point from Cooper's letter to Vail requiring comment is the author's practice of not referring to the original manuscript when reading proofs. Except under the most unusual circumstances, Cooper read and corrected the printer's proofs set from his own manuscript or from the fair copy (in the case of Bravo, printed by Richard Bentley in London). As is known from those few cases where proofs survive ( Prairie and Afloat and Ashore ), he corrected errors as he saw them, and made changes in areas always of concern to him (for example, the proper registration of dialect.) But, as with the fair copy, he did not correct the proofs against either his own or the amanuensis copies. In accordance with Richard Bentley's interpretation of the legal obligations for obtaining British copyrights, Cooper's manuscripts were sent to Bentley, who kept them. Thus they were not available to Cooper when he read the proofs set from them. Indeed, he made clear to Bentley that in setting Bravo, "[i]t is not necessary to send back the copy [of "nearly all of the manuscript of second volume"], as I scarcely ever refer to it . . ." ( L&amp;J, 2.93). In summary, the first printed text of Bravo was subjected to two transcriptions of the author's extant manuscript, the fair copy and the first proofs, both of which Cooper read and revised—but not against his own final intentions inscribed in his manuscript. The experience of the CE strongly confirms Cooper's speculations—those CE editors who have "take[n] the trouble to compare" extant manuscripts with the printed texts Cooper proofread have indeed found that the latter "differ materially from the manuscript."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cooper and His Printers Having examined Cooper's characteristic degrees of control over his closest collaborators, his family copyists, let me turn to a more detailed discussion of his relationship with the printers of his first proofs. Except on rare occasions where time or distance precluded review, Cooper always examined and corrected the first proofs himself. For Cooper, the interventions of the printers such review disclosed were ones he alternatingly welcomed and abhorred . Unfortunately, his letters disclose far more concern with these collaborators ' missteps than with their improvements. Writing to his first publisher, Andrew Thompson Goodrich, on 2 July 1820, Cooper concluded a letter filled with the anxieties of a first author with the plea to "Hasten the first proof sheet [of Precaution ], as it may suggest some alterations in the Chapters and I hourly expect the " Union " in, and must go to Sag-Harbor as soon as I hear of her arrival" ( L&amp;J, 1.46). Most curious is this conjunction of concerns about his two immediate commercial prospects: authorship and whaling. At this stage in his career, Cooper knew a good deal more about the commerce of the sea than that of publishing. But in his extensive correspondence with Goodrich, we see Cooper beginning to learn the technicalities of composition, proofreading, and publishing the hard way—on the job. After several months of intense struggle with Goodrich, the best Cooper could do to close the gap between the holograph final intentions and printed text for Precaution was to include an errata sheet. But from his experience with seeing his first manuscript through the press (discussed below), Cooper developed practices to execute textual revisions that he used throughout his career. He learned from Precaution how to define for publishers and their compositors specific and delimited roles as collaborators in trying to construct his final intentions for his major works. As we shall see, the unanticipated demand for his second novel, The Spy (1821), provided Cooper with an opportunity Precaution did not offer—to make significant revisions after the first edition for three distinct new editions (two in 1822 and one in 1831). Through 1831, his correspondence discloses that he revised, at least once, every novel he wrote. His correspondence does not always indicate all the editions he revised; editors must undertake extensive collations of all texts possibly under his control to determine which contain variants likely to be authorial. Although Cooper revised for subsequent editions only three ( Pathfinder , Deerslayer, and The Two Admirals ) of the twenty-one novels he wrote after 1831, for many of these titles manuscript and other pre-publication materials exist to aid the Cooper editor in determining the author's final intentions for both substantives and accidentals. Whatever romantic notions persist about the circumstances of Cooper's writing Precaution, his correspondence with Goodrich about seeing the novel through the press is grimly realistic. As a body, these letters show Cooper beginning to develop his career-long expectations and demands for the kinds of cooperation he wanted from the printing shop. Once the proofs began to arrive , Cooper was appalled with the errors he soon detected. Cooper's first extant response of 4 July 1820, in his characteristically conversational prose, begins with polite but firm correction: Yours has been received—I am obliged to you for any little suggestions you may make in relation to its success—but the faults I apprehend; (in the page you have sent me) rest with the printer. I have corrected it, as I am persuaded the manuscript reads—or is meant to read—in one instance they have made nonsense. I never use the term "relax from embarrassments" though " release " is what we all wish under those circumstances—the Book is certainly written hastily—but the style is not bad . . . I must revise the proof sheets myself, as I now feel certain the compositors will not be able to make it out without me—the spelling is in many cases bad—the consequences of looseness in my manner of writing—I will however examine the manuscript more closely, as it proceeds and you must send me the proof sheets. ( L&amp;J, 1.46-47) The substance here of the first sentence echoes throughout the thirty years of Cooper's career that lay ahead with respect to the dual appeal for collaboration with his various publishers: make "any little suggestions" that may improve the work's success but correct the faults that "rest with the printer." To guide this collaboration, Cooper exhorted his publishers and printers to take care where he had not, especially to understand the idiosyncrasies of his writing and orthography: (28 June 1820): My writing is so bad and I am so very careless with it that unless great care is taken with the printing and orthography—the Book will be badly gotten up— The business of paragraphs is an important one and I have made little marks * where I think there should be a new one—the speeches should be in lines by themselves generally, but to write closely I have omitted it in many cases. ( L&amp;J, 1.44-45) (2 July 1820): I expect the compositors will curse the scribe not a little, but they must be patient as the thing is remedyless, &amp; by all means let them be particular to the punctuation, without which no book is " readable. " ( L&amp;J, 1.46) Cooper's first encounters with printers led him to pledge to take more care with his writing and especially the punctuation ("I have paid more attention to the pointing, and think it will be easier work as they proceed," 12 July 1820, L&amp;J, 1.49). To aid his collaborators in the printing shop, in the same letter to Goodrich he sent them "the spelling of the names —which written off plainly on bits of papers will prevent the mistakes which occur sometimes in the manuscript, creepin[g] into the proof sheets—." These early letters to Goodrich—like several later concerning Precaution and many about his subsequent publications—disclose Cooper's clear sense of how he wanted his publishers and printers to collaborate. His role was to acknowledge his own lapses and identify general problems (like consistency of names). Their obligation was to locate and correct these lapses, as well as to correct any other authorial oversights they detected. Reading more proofs brought more problems and more appeals for care, along with practical advice on difficulties compositors were likely to encounter in an orthography Cooper was unwilling or unable to change: "I like the frequent use of the dash—and believe they have ommitted [ sic ] it in one or two cases where I was at pains to insert it. They must observe however that I never use the period but close most of my sentences with the dash. This of course is not to be printed so—" (17 July; L&amp;J, 1.50). Cooper concluded a second letter to Goodrich of 17 July with the expectation he would soon be able to submit manuscript for the second volume of Precaution. He anticipated that in his final review of the remaining manuscript of the volume he might overlook "grammatical errors, and some words may be omitted as I read it over very rapidly from necessity. If any such meet your notice you will please alter th[is?] and I can see the proof afterwards . . ." ( L&amp;J, 1.51). Two days later, he informed Goodrich of the necessity of leaving Angevine (the farm near Mamaroneck that Susan Cooper's father gave them in 1817) to attend to other business (including the newly returned whaling ship). In his absence he pressed Susan into the role of proofreader, making clear to Goodrich that her corrections should also be incorporated into what he hoped was the increasingly correct text of Precaution. However, three letters at the end of August convey his anguish at finding the proofs of the second volume riddled with errors, most vexingly in passages where he had already provided corrections. A letter (27? August 1820) details Cooper's concerns with errors in the first volume, which Goodrich had presented to Cooper as " ready for the public eye. " In addition to numerous gaffes, Cooper protested vehemently about the misuse of articles, since "the judicious use of the articles and the qualifying words—is one of the characteristic distinctions between American writers and the English[,] also of the affected sentimental and plain good sense" ( L&amp;J, 1.56). Eight more letters follow in September with more evidence of specific passages requiring correction, resulting in Cooper's finally assenting to and composing a detailed errata notice: [t]he evil consequences [of bad printing] pervade every chapter in the Book after the 15th and those not in commas and dashes —but in sense —grammar—and execution to an almost ruinous degree—(7-8 September; L&amp;J, 1.58) I send you a few more corrections for the errata —there are many more mistakes in the proof but such as will pass one or two of grammar—but I will leave them for the general apology—In future I shall not notice the spelling at all—leaving it solely for you—unless a proper name occurs spelt wrong—there are so many mistakes in the last proofs that I am afraid my corrections will be so numerous otherwise they will overlook some—the insertion or omission of the letter S—is of much more importance at the end of a word than the printers seem to think—it alters the grammar always and frequently the style materially—(12-14? September; L&amp;J, 1.60) And finally in an almost stream-of-consciousness blending of concerns about printers' errors, timely publication, and other business and personal matters, Cooper wrote to Goodrich in mid-month: I return the proof—the book drags on very heavily—and I am afraid Van Winkle does not employ competent compositors—the mistakes they make are ludicrous and since I have urged the division into paragraphs they have in several instances made them in the middle of sentences . . . cannot the thing be hastened—I am extremely anxious to go to Sag-Harbor and Mrs. Cooper is afraid to undertake it [proofreading] again in my absence—the second volume is far—far better than the first—but they still leave mistakes unnoticed—the letter S at the end of words—its omission or insertion is of great importance and there are at least a dozen mistakes of that nature most if not all of which are notic'd by me— (13-25? September; L&amp;J, 1.60-61) When the two volumes of Precaution were finally printed and bound in mid-October, Cooper confessed he could "honestly own I am pleased with my appearance" (19-20 October?; L&amp;J, 1.66), diplomatically blaming the faults on his own casual approach to authorship rather than on Goodrich. But seeing his first work through the press was a painful lesson in collaboration. His volcanic outburst to Goodrich of 25 August records his bitterness with how " they " (the printers) perverted his work with their unwanted interventions, to the point where their collaboration destroyed his efforts. Indeed, with mock solemnity, he invited Goodrich's printers to write their own book rather than intrude on his: if the book be printed in this careless manner revision by the author is useless—it is possible from haste there may be grammatical errors—but I wish my own language printed—having quite as much faith in my own taste as in that of any printer in the Union—let them give me a fair chance—the work is mine and I am willing to keep the faults—if they want to write I will suggest the expediency of their taking up a new subject where they can find full scope for their talents—let my book be literally my own. They cannot possibly understand my meaning as well as myself. . . . if they wish to write—let them begin de novo. ( L&amp;J, 1.54-55) (Ironically, Goodrich's printer was the highly-respected Cornelius van Winkle, author of an important book on collaboration in the printing shop, the 1818 The Printer's Guide, or an Introduction to the Art of Printing, Including an Essay on Punctuation, and Remarks on Orthography. ) 5 5. Fortunately—especially given the harshness of Cooper's comments on Goodrich's professionalism—the publisher donated the surviving manuscript of Precaution itself, with the cache of letters, to the New-York Historical Society in 1838. Cooper neatly numbered each page of the manuscript folios, which he covered in small script on both sides. Cooper clearly thought of the project in two volumes, since after folio 113, the numeration system restarts with "chapter 1" and page 1. While the manuscript for volume 1 is complete, volume 2 lacks folios 9-10, 29-34, 37-42, 45-58, 61-80, and all folios after number 82. The first several pages disclose Cooper taking care to write neatly and space his lines well. However, the manuscript soon shows Cooper lapsing into a more cursive and difficult hand, and the number of lines per sheet increase from 35-36 to as many as 44. As was his practice throughout his career, the author jammed the text into the right-hand edge of the sheets, so that (given the wear on the sheets) ends of words and punctuation are often now unrecoverable. New chapters begin immediately after the conclusion of the previous one, signaled by an appropriate heading of "chapter" plus the relevant number. Cooper's occasional revisions—word changes (such as "that" to "which," in punctuation, and additions or substitutions)—demonstrate his review of the manuscript before committing it to the printing shop. The marks (crosses or asterisks) which Cooper used to direct the printers (according to his letter to Goodrich of 28 June 1820) to start new paragraphs where he ran the manuscript text together are quite visible. Further, in the margin of folio 104, Cooper clearly instructed the printers to "let this conversation be printed in distinct speeches." The passage in question must have been a compositor's nightmare—Cooper, either in the heat of composition or to conserve paper—had run a dialogue together without separate lineation. At some point the manuscript was bound: the left-hand side has one-inch margins and stitch holes are apparent. Printer's marks on the manuscript show that the printing shop used it to set type. Precaution was a modest success, but Cooper had, as early as his third letter to Goodrich of 28 June 1820, begun work on a new work, The Spy, which he reports "my female Mentor [doubtless his wife Susan] says . . . throws Precaution far in the back-ground" ( L&amp;J, 1.44). Not until the second American edition of 1839 did Cooper appear to return to his first novel to effect a revision. While his last letters to Goodrich on Precaution disclose, on balance, his pleasure with getting his first work through the fires of collaboration with his printers, he entrusted his next two works—the ones that established his career and reputation—to the more experienced New York firm of Charles Wiley. The first editions of both The Spy (1821) and The Pioneers (1823) sold very well, and popular demand in both cases led promptly to new typesettings. And both novels were among the eight novels Cooper revised in the early 1830s for the Bentley Standard Novels series. These opportunities to prepare revised editions for Spy and Pioneers provided Cooper with a new set of challenges in collaborating with more experienced and professional firms to revise early texts to embody his final intentions. However, the first editions of The Spy and The Pioneers, published by Charles Wiley of New York, are almost as error-laden as Precaution; indeed, Pioneers also required an errata note. For better or worse, no correspondence between Cooper and the publishers survives regarding the lapses of these first Wiley editions. Fortunately, Cooper's second and third novels proved to be sufficiently popular successes that the market immediately demanded new editions for both. As the CE critical editions show, in both cases Cooper worked hard and fast in these new editions to repair the blunders that had escaped his notice in proofing the first editions. 6 6. For detailed accounts of the initial and subsequent revised editions of both novels, see the Textual Commentaries of The Spy: A Tale of The Neutral Ground (New York: AMS Press, 2002), ed. James P. Elliott, Lance Schachterle, and Jeffrey Walker, and of The Pioneers: or The Sources of the The Susquehanna (Albany: SUNY Press, 1980), ed. Lance Schachterle and Kenneth M. Andersen Jr. After the enormous success of Spy at home (and its pirating in London), Cooper pursued the potential British market for Pioneers vigorously, and initiated practices that continued for much of his career of sending his London publishers corrected proofs of his American first editions. To John Murray , the first London publisher to issue a Cooper novel by arrangement with the author, Cooper sent the following instructions for collaboration on the first British edition of The Pioneers: I ought in justice to myself to say, that in opposition to a thousand good resolutions , the Pioneers, has been more hastily and carelessly written than any of my books—Not a line has been copied, and it has gone from my desk to the printers—I have not to this moment been able even to read it—The corrections I have made are from Queries of Mr. Wiley, or by glancing my eye over the work, so that if you find any errors in grammar or awkward sentences you are at liberty to have them altered— Though I should wish the latter to be done very sparingly, both because that one mans [ sic ] style seldom agrees with anothers [ sic ], and because a similar liberty was abused to a degree in "Precaution," that materially injured the Book— ( L&amp;J, 1.86) From a collaborator's point of view, this combination of license to correct and of caution to respect "one mans style" must have been perplexing, doubtless even more so to London publishers with an established British house style than to Goodrich (who received similar entreaties to correct Cooper's lapses without interfering with his meaning.) Three weeks later, Cooper sent the remaining text (in "two complete sets and part of a third") for Murray's next volume, with a detailed commentary on how to respond to authorial revisions made on the various proofs: You will perceive that corrections are made in some of the pages that are omitted in the duplicates—I wish them all to be made. The difference arises from my making corrections as my eye accidentally detected the error—The words "kind of" and "sort of" occur too frequently in the book, though sometimes properly—You are at liberty to strike out most of them— I am ashamed to say that I have not even read the printed book, regularily [ sic ]— but I trust much to your proofs— ( L&amp;J, 1.91-92) Clearly Cooper expected his new London publisher to exercise a prudent, limited collaboration in preparing the novel for British audiences. In 1831, Cooper returned to both Spy and Pioneers to prepare revised texts for the "Bentley Standard Novels" series. He continued to count upon his British publishers, now Colburn and Bentley, to instruct their printers to rectify errors Cooper missed in preparing these early novels for re-issue in texts he revised with more care than at any other occasion in his career. "I return the whole of Spy, corrected," he wrote to Colburn and Bentley from Paris on 12 April 1831. "The proof-reader must be careful, and consult the sense, for it is possible in the haste which you have exacted I may have made one mistake in correcting another. The book was full of faults and I am amazed to see how many had crept in through the carelessness of the printers, though Heaven knows, there were enough of my own" ( L&amp;J, 2.67-68). The interleaved text Cooper prepared for the Standard Novels revision of Spy is extant, and provides scholars with the best evidence we have of the kinds and degrees of changes Cooper made while revising the novel he deemed the most in need of "a severe pen." 7 7. CE used Cooper's extant holograph for the Bentley Standard Novels revision directly in preparing our edition of The Spy as well as collateral evidence for the kinds of variants Cooper most likely made in the Bentley revised texts of The Pioneers and The Last of the Mohicans. The interleaved revisions include hundreds of changes, ranging from full pages through the smallest details of the text (often involving the heightening or consistent registration of dialect). Cooper even attended to punctuation changes, providing a good case study of how authors can revise accidentals as well as substantives. In the first paragraph alone of the revised Spy, he deleted six commas, presumably to pick up the narrative pace. On the front of the interleaved copy, Cooper further instructed the British printers as follows: "note Bene—No attention will be given to the spelling, except in words of local use, the names, or those which are evidently intended to be corrupt. The proof reader will take care of the others." 8 8. CE edition of The Pioneers, p. 483. In other words, in making his revisions Cooper sanctioned the British compositors and proofreaders to correct errors in common words that missed his attention, but to respect any changes he made in formal names or in dialect ("words of local use . . . or those which are evidently intended to be corrupt.") This "note Bene" on the manuscript revisions for Spy captures Cooper's expectations for his collaborators in the printing and proofing stages: correct those errors you believe are authorial oversights but preserve those unconventional forms that you believe are intended as such. However, the achievements of Cooper's collaborators in this regard were often indifferent. As the textual commentaries of many of the CE texts show, Greg and Bowers were correct in arguing that successive re-composition of texts such as Cooper's tended to move unconventional forms, especially dialect, towards conventional ones. 9 9. See especially the Textual Commentaries for The Spy and The Pioneers for detailed descriptions of Cooper's efforts while revising to reinstate or create dialect forms appropriate to the backgrounds of his characters. The CE texts of Spy and Pioneers also disclose that the Bentley compositor followed Cooper's interlineated corrections with remarkable fidelity (dialect aside), occasionally correcting errors Cooper had missed. Subsequent letters to Bentley concerning the three historical novels set in Europe show Cooper's appreciation of their workmanship. Concerning The Bravo, set in Venice, Cooper admonished Bentley's staff in early June 1831 to respond appropriately to both American and Italian forms: Let me beg you will have the revises carefully read. I pay no attention to any of the spelling, except in words of particular signification and proper names. There is a great difference in the spelling in England and America. We use one g in wagon, no u in honor and words of that class, e in visiter &amp;c &amp;c. The Italians spell feluca with one c, and I have corrected the proofs in that manner, but if your reader thinks there is sufficient English authority to use two cs he is at liberty to do so— ( L&amp;J, 2.93) Here as in all other London editions, Colburn and Bentley consistently followed British usages in the spelling variants Cooper cited, with no known protest from him. Even after his return to the United States and residency in Cooperstown, Cooper continued to entrust Bentley's staff with the difficulties of printing from his manuscripts, as shown in his letter of 6 July 1837 concerning his naval history: . . . I have sent you the manuscript of this work, instead of printed sheets. It is pretty carefully corrected, but will require a vigilant proof-reader, one like him who corrected the Headsman. I might have sent a more fairly written copy, but I thought it might be some little compensation for the extra trouble, if I gave you the original, in my own hand. Some one may give you a few pounds for it, possibly. ( L&amp;J, 3.269) Cooper again praised the Headsman (1833) proofreader when sending the manuscript of Homeward Bound on 17 October 1837: The manuscript is corrected with some care, and is copied pretty plainly, but I beg you will give it a thorough reader, and one who will attend to the sense. The person who read Headsman is a capital fellow, let him be who he may. ( L&amp;J, 3.298)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cooper and John Fagan In the productive final decade of his career beginning in 1840, in which Cooper wrote sixteen of his thirty-two novels, for the most part the author relied on his own handwriting to produce clear enough copy for his printers. Manuscripts from this last decade show an author determined to make his hand easier to read. During revision, Cooper often reshaped letters and, crucially , by writing on lined folio sheets he avoided overcrowding his lines of script (except at the unlined tops of pages where he often reverted to his old habits of packing the lines in!). And from at least 1838, Cooper began to rely more on a new form of publishing, involving his adapting of a fairly new printing technology: stereotyping of standing type to enable printing (and reprinting) from metal copies of hand-set type-pages without the expense of recomposition. In his professional career, Cooper probably came to trust no one in the publishing business more than John Fagan, who regularly made stereotype plates for the Philadelphia firm Carey, Lea, and Blanchard. Carey and Lea had published Cooper's last novel completed in America before his departure to Europe, The Last of the Mohicans, in 1826 (which, according to Robert Spiller, Fagan stereotyped.) 10 10. Robert E. Spiller and Philip C. Blackburn, A Descriptive Bibliography of the Writings of James Fenimore Cooper (New York: R. R. Bowker, 1934), p. 7. Upon Cooper's return to the United States in 1833, Carey became his favored American publishers until their collapse in the 1840s and his shifting of business to New York publishers in 1844. Even after Cooper no longer used the Philadelphia publishers, he counted on Fagan to oversee the typesetting and to prepare the stereotyped plates for all his works from Home as Found (1838) to Ways of the Hour (1850). As James Franklin Beard notes, "[t]heir relationship was a particularly close and happy one, especially after Cooper began [with Afloat and Ashore ] the practice of financing the stereotyped plates of his books and leasing them to publishers or booksellers for stated periods" ( L&amp;J, 4.446). For example, Cooper counted on Fagan to deal with a minor problem of inscription that vexed him through his career—keeping the spelling of his characters' names consistent. As he wrote to Fagan on 4 March 1845 of his new book Satanstoe: You will find the name of the heroine printed "Aneke"—It must be altered wherever it occurs to "Anneke," or with two nn's—I add, when it is used the first or second time, "Anne"—This must be altered in this way, "Anneke (Anna Cornelia, abbreviated) ." ( L&amp;J, 5.12) Instructions of such complexity betoken a collaborator who had earned Cooper's trust. Perhaps this trust was in part born of economic necessity. Having in Fagan a trusted collaborator probably assisted Cooper materially in the 1840s when he was publishing typically two books a year (and for each receiving half or less the income his earlier fiction had generated). Further evidence of Cooper's close working relationship with Fagan comes from the CE text of the two volumes of Afloat and Ashore (1844), edited by Thomas and Marianne Philbrick. The editors have shown that Fagan not only corrected Cooper's manuscript readings (and inevitably introduced errors in the process); he also freely made small stylistic changes and queried Cooper both on dubious readings and passages where he disagreed with Cooper's intent. Fagan's copy-editing in preparation for initial typesetting and subsequent stereotyping often effected Cooper's desire to save the author from grammatical lapses. Without any known protest from Cooper, Fagan subjected Cooper's manuscripts to careful and detailed copy-editing involving hundreds of small, silent changes of Cooper's holograph, in both accidentals and substantives. But by consulting the extant manuscripts, the editors have identified over 1,100 substantive variants between the manuscript and the first American edition where neither Fagan nor Cooper noted the corruptions of Cooper's final intentions as inscribed in his manuscript. 11 11. The Philbricks kindly made their Textual Commentary in their CSE-approved edition available to the current author before publication. Their text provides the most detailed analysis of Cooper's collaboration with Fagan (or for that matter, any other collaborator) that we have. Passages relevant to the current discussion are reprinted in the Appendix below. Not only did Cooper entrust his new books during this period to Fagan, he counted on Fagan to see through the press the eleven revised texts he prepared, at the end of his life, for the "Author's Revised Edition" issued 1849-51 by George P. Putnam. The first book in the series was the much-revised Spy, for which Cooper admitted continued concern with printers errors: The English edition [the Bentley Standard Novels revision] from which you will print has many mistakes I find; principally from not reading my writing well [the reference is presumably to Cooper's extant holograph revisions for Bentley, which are more detailed and numerous than any other extant authorial revisions except The Prairie. ] They often mistake an "on" for "in," my o resembling an i. I find other mistakes. You will have to read the proofs carefully, and let nothing unintelligible pass. In very difficult cases, the proof might be sent to me. ( L&amp;J, 6.15) Cooper's implied license here, to "let nothing unintelligible pass," is for him an extraordinary show of confidence in a collaborator who over the years clearly he had grown to rely on implicitly—a collaboration far different from his first with Andrew Thompson Goodrich in 1820. In the absence of textual witnesses, however, assessing Fagan's role versus Cooper's own in making the comparatively few revisions CE editors consider substantive in the Putnam texts is difficult at best. 12 12. Clear evidence of Cooper's attention to making changes for the Putnam edition other than adding or revising introductions is scant. Many of the variants disclosed by collation are indifferent. The CE editors of The Spy and The Pioneers, arguing for Cooper's continued concerns for these much-revised texts, accept a small number of variants as Cooper's work. In contrast, Thomas and Marianne Philbrick consider the Putnam variants in The Red Rover to lack "the boldness that is the best internal evidence of authorial intervention ," rejecting them all. See their Textual Commentary to The Red Rover (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991), p. 478.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion: What Cooper Intended His Collaborators To Do The answer to the first question posed early in this paper should be fairly clear: "How and where did Cooper and his collaborators (licensed and otherwise) succeed—or fail—in realizing Cooper's final intentions for his works?" From Goodrich to Fagan, Cooper expected those professionals in printing and proofreading, with whom inescapably he had to collaborate, to distinguish between his errors and oversights (which they were to set right) while preserving faithfully what he told John Murray was "one mans style" (clearly his own) which "seldom agrees with anothers" ( L&amp;J, 1.86). Cooper pressed into collaboration even artistic friends like Horace Greenough, to whom on 17 February 1830 he sent a manuscript letter (to the Edinburgh Review, never published) with the injunction "to read, for typographical and grammatical errors, and when these are corrected, I shall want to see a proof myself" ( L&amp;J, 1.404). Typographical and grammatical errors—or, as indicated elsewhere, inconsistencies in proper names or even (to the trusted Fagan) anything " unintelligible"—he expected his collaborators to correct. But concerning substance and style, he was firm. From Precaution on (when he distinguished between British and American conventions in using articles) he brooked no interference with his final intentions with respect to substantives. Even suggestions for "improvements" from the trusted Fagan the Philbricks have shown in Afloat and Ashore often met with peremptory rejection. 13 13. In "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," Studies in Bibliography 29 (1976), 167-212, G. Thomas Tanselle reviews in detail issues associated with the legitimacy of critical editors accepting as authorial intention changes made by collaborators licensed and closely instructed by the author. Tanselle argues that "if an author accepts what someone else has done not in a spirit of acquiescence but of active collaboration, the result does represent his active intention" (191). CE believes that Fagan's collaboration is an excellent example of active collaboration representing the author's final intentions in those areas Cooper requested Fagan to address. In short, he intended his collaborators to perform the services of copy-editors , but no more. As he specified on 18 June 1839 to Richard Bentley, he preferred his English publisher to print from corrected American proofs, not the manuscript British copyright law required Bentley to have: "So many improvements in style &amp;c are made in going through the press, that I greatly prefer sending the sheets [along with the manuscript]" ( L&amp;J, 3.393). He required typesetters and proofreaders to correct any minor errors, but also to capture his final intentions for style and substance as he inscribed them. As he wrote to wife Susan on 22 May 1850 when attending to business in New York, including proudly seeing daughter Susan's Rural Hours through Putnam's press, "I . . . hav[e] got the printer cornered, so that he must do his duty" ( L&amp;J, 6.80). No where in his extant correspondence is there evidence he entertained collaborative suggestions of any more substance, except perhaps for dutiful references to accepting the advice of his "female Mentor," wife Susan, in general ways in his early fiction. 14 14. As Thomas Philbrick has reminded me in a personal communication (25 March 2003), on many matters large and small in his nautical fiction Cooper readily accepted the advice of his closest friend of thirty years, Rear-Admiral William Branford Shubrick (17901874) . By comparison, even Fagan's suggestions were sometimes subjected to Cooper's peremptory dismissals. After he was established as an author, he rarely changed his mind about the shape of his projects. (At least one example of altering his original intentions does exist: after cajoling Bentley for several years about a pet experiment, to write a novel with ships— not humans—as characters, he backed off from this radical project in The Two Admirals by introducing human actors as well as the fleets they command. 15 15. See Donald A. Ringe's Historical Introduction to The Two Admirals (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990), pp. xiv-xv. The second question raised in this essay was: "For editorial purposes, when manuscripts of Cooper's work in his own hand are extant, should CE scholars use as copy-texts such holograph witnesses? Or should they turn for copy-texts to first editions for which Cooper is known to have read proof and which may benefit from the improvements of his collaborators?" This question is crucial for framing the debate about recovering authorial intention. Using the holograph where extant as copy-text grants final authority to the author alone, at the expense of losing any improvements the author may have desired and expected from professional collaborators. Using as copy-text any authorial version (subsequent to the extant holograph) upon which collaborators have made sanctioned or unlicensed revisions potentially captures those collaborators' improvements but at the price of introducing non-authorial variants. To establish a text that most fully represents Cooper's intentions at all stages of his engagement with his text, CE editors exercise critical judgment to identify those post-copy-text variants certain or likely to be authorial and incorporate them into the copy-text (always the holograph if available), rejecting variants not believed to have authorial sanction. To use again Cooper's words to Aaron Vail when forwarding the manuscript for Princess Victoria, the CE critical editors have "take[n] the trouble to compare them" (the manuscripts with subsequent authoritative witnesses) and have thus seized the "opportunity of getting an insight into the secrets of authorship." These "secrets" enable the CE to identify Cooper's final holograph intentions, as disclosed by the extant witnesses closest to his hand, while also preserving those variants in subsequent witnesses which the editors deem likely to be authorial. 16 16. The twenty published texts of the Cooper edition show the received wisdom about many of Cooper's practices as a professional writer is plainly wrong. William Charvat's pronouncement that "rewriting and revision of manuscript seem never to have caused him [Cooper] any pain—simply because he did not rewrite" simply discloses that Charvat failed to look at manuscripts readily available to him or to study the history of revision of printed texts sketched in Spiller and Blackburn's bibliography. See William Charvat, "Cooper as Professional Author," in James Fenimore Cooper: A Re-Appraisal (Cooperstown: New York State Historical Association, 1954), p. 499. And in many college surveys, Mark Twain's jealous attacks on Cooper still too often lazily substitute for actually reading Cooper. See Lance Schachterle and Kent Ljungquist, "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Defenses: Twain and the Text of The Deerslayer," Studies in the American Renaissance (1988), 401-417, for an examination of the text of Deerslayer Twain invented (which is quite different from the one Cooper wrote). With respect to editorial policy for authorial final intentions, one other issue needs to be discussed. Authors may well revise a text for audiences different from the original one and with a different intention in mind. In such cases, the revision could well be considered a new work whose variants should not be conflated with the text of the first edition. The question for Cooper thus is: when he revised earlier texts, did he consider himself to be perfecting his initial intentions? Or was he creating a new work as well as a new text? The best evidence on this issue is the text he revised most in his life, The Spy. His two revisions accomplished within months of the December 1821 first edition for the most part correct egregious errors, which (as with Precaution ) doubtless resulted from both his and the printers' lapses. When the author returned to the work in 1831, he not only provided much more extensive rewrites of many passages, but (as he did for all the Bentley Standard Novels texts) he added footnotes identifying specific historical references. His immediate audience for these notes was obviously British, and one might argue that because of this new audience and context, the Bentley text thus is a sufficiently different work such that its variants should not be conflated with the text of the first edition. However, in writing to Bentley on 14 March 1831 ( L&amp;J, 2.60-61) about the project for the new texts for the Bentley series, Cooper emphasized continuity—rather than an esthetic disjuncture—with the earlier texts. He called Bentley's attention to his earlier attempts in "revising the books," which he had already done in "[a]ll the American editions" which were "cursorily revised down to Pilot." For Spy he looked forward in a new Preface to putting down the claims of "an impudent rogue in America, who pretends to be the original of the Spy . . . I should not dislike an opportunity of stating what gave rise to the conception of the character—." Cooper's emphasis falls on making the Bentley revisions the embodiment of his final intentions coincident with those original objectives that failed in execution because of earlier editions "full of errors." Arguing that "it is harder work to read these things than it is to write them," Cooper somewhat disingenuously asked "Do the public care enough about these things? How much will you give a volume, or rather a book, for new prefaces, notes and hints explanatory." But Cooper immediately added that the "new prefaces, notes and hints explanatory" must be shared with his American audiences: "In every case, I must condition for the privilege of giving the same notes and prefaces simultaneously to Messrs Carey and Lea, for with me, it is a point of honor to continue rigidly as American author." As I have argued elsewhere, 17 17. See my "Cooper's Spy and the Possibility of American Fiction," Studies in the Humanities , 18 (1991), 180-199. Cooper's intention with the notes here is to open up the historicity of The Spy, which was part of his initial conception . ("The task of making American Manners and American scenes is an arduous one," but clearly one he accepted with energy as he wrote to Goodrich when Spy was draining his imaginative energy away from Precaution; see L&amp;J, 1.44). In each text of Spy he revised after the first, he realized these intentions with language of increasing precision as well as with notes explicating his original intentions because of what, for his readers, increasingly was becoming American recollection rather than immediate experience. But the record shows he viewed his labors as progressively refining and clarifying his original aims, rather than creating (as Byron clearly did) variant texts reimagined for new audiences. One letter from late in Cooper's life nicely captures Cooper's recognition of his need for collaborators in the process of getting his words before his public. Often the extant letters of Cooper's last several years disclose an author more willing than earlier to let his guard down. These letters show Cooper communicating with chatty, human affection to family members and with conversational warmth to those colleagues—principally John Fagan and, in more guarded ways, Richard Bentley—with whom years of collaboration had yielded a measure of trust. Let me conclude with one of the happiest examples of such letters, a mock-humorous, tongue-in-cheek but revealing letter to the New York Typographical Society, a professional organization that literally embodied Cooper's dependence on collaborators from the printing shop. Writing on 5 January 1850, twenty months before his death on 14 September 1851, Cooper made his last recorded comment on his collaboration with those professionals who saw his various inscribed final intentions into print. Declining with regret an invitation to the annual dinner in January 1850 of the printers' society to celebrate the first career of Benjamin Franklin, Cooper wrote: Man and boy, my connexion with your craft has now lasted quite half a century. Commencing as a caprice, the accidents of life have caused it to become a very serious occupation. Amateur and writer, I have got to be so familiar with types as to regard them as old friends. 18 18. Cooper's reference here to a half-century "connexion with your craft" suggests Cooper is recollecting his childhood play in the Phinney printing shop in Cooperstown. (See L&amp;J, 1.47, note 2, for Beard's comment on Cooper's 4 July 1820 letter to Goodrich, which disclosed some earlier familiarity with the mechanics if not the business of printing.) But as Thomas Philbrick pointed out to me in his personal correspondence of 25 March 2003, Cooper's reference to his career "commencing as a caprice" probably reinforces his carefully cultivated position that he began authorship with Precaution as a lark. More likely, authorship for Cooper was one of several competing potential sources of income (along with farming and whaling) as his finances got more desperate at the beginning of the 1820s. After a long paragraph celebrating "the increasing list of American writers"—who owe their existence in part to their collaborations with the sponsors of the printers' dinner—Cooper assured the members of the New York Typographical Society that [A]fter all, then, we [authors] shall owe our immortality to you. In short, we are mutually necessary to each other, and the circumstance should produce and perpetuate good feeling between us. Franklin, and others of name, connected with your art, will be properly remembered in your toasts, and I crave permission to offer one that refers to a member of the craft who might otherwise be overlooked, viz— THE DEVIL—a link between the author and the printer; may he come with queries well put, and return with every error corrected. ( L&amp;J, 6.107-108) After a long career as recorded in the letters presented here of being bedeviled by links between the author and the printer that often failed to " return with every error corrected," Cooper's jovial salutation recognized at last that, with respect to communicating his final intentions, author and printer were, of necessity, "mutually necessary to each other, and the circumstance should produce and perpetuate good feeling between us." Given the difficulties Cooper's crabbed manuscripts and exigent but often vague demands imposed on the society of typographers for three decades, his final acknowledgment of mutual need was not only just but also generous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX Observations on the collaboration between Cooper and John Fagan, reprinted with the permission of Thomas and Marianne Philbrick from their Textual Commentary for their CE edition of Cooper's 1844 novel Afloat and Ashore (AMS Press, 2004). The surviving proof sheets of Afloat and Ashore . . . provide a revealing glimpse into the relation of author and printer in the production of mid-nineteenth-century American texts in general and, more specifically, they supply an extensive demonstration of the process by which Cooper and Fagan collaborated to produce the novels of the writer's last twelve years. For the first time the entire sequence of steps that led from the author's manuscript to the printed pages of the first American edition can be followed in detail. It now becomes clear that Fagan's compositors not only corrected obvious errors in the manuscript and introduced the usual number of errors of their own but freely initiated stylistic "improvements," many of which, in the absence of the proof sheets, would be virtually impossible to distinguish from Cooper's revisions. Moreover, the proof sheets display Fagan's important role in the process, for it was he who initially proofread the typeset copy, comparing it to the manuscript and catching many of the compositors' errors and innovations (but missing many others), and it was he who acted as a copy-editor by querying phrasing that he regarded as infelicitous and proposing changes for the author to consider. Finally the proof sheets afford a full picture of Cooper's role, as he responded positively or negatively to Fagan's queries, corrected some of the errors that had eluded Fagan's proofing, and continued the revision of his text that he had begun with his manuscript alterations—all the time, it would seem, working without further reference to the manuscript. The text that resulted from this process, the basis for the first American edition and for all subsequent printings of Afloat and Ashore, is a highly imperfect one. As the proof sheets reveal, in Part 1 alone more than 600 substantive departures from the author's manuscript, consisting of compositorial errors as well as innovations, escaped the scrutiny of Fagan and Cooper. Some of those printers' variants merely blunt the edges of Miles Wallingford's narration, as when (at 1.226.26-27) Emily Merton's "bright, blue, English eye" becomes her "light, blue English eye," or muffle the tones of a character's speech, as when Marble, asserting that he has enough needles and thread to "set up" a slop shop, is made to say that he has enough to "supply" one (at 1.435.17). But many other such variants do serious damage to Cooper's meanings, as when the compositor drops whole lines of the manuscript (at 1.459.14-17 and 1.471.79) or misreads "into the colony" as "in the valley" (at 1.16.22), "even more" as "comrade" (1.23.6), "gleaned" as "gained" (1.66.4), "sly" as "shy" (1.166.5), "hint" as "point" (1.181.16), "more" as "men" (1.278.25), "sheers" as "shores" (1.359.27), "Callao" as "called" (1.383.27), "minx" as "miss" (1.475.16), "artlessness" as " restlessness " (1.515.17), and even "south" as "north" (1.231.1). In setting the text of Afloat and Ashore from Cooper's manuscript, Fagan's compositors applied what would seem to be a house style in the treatment of capitalization , spelling, and punctuation. Thus at the same time that the compositors correct a good number of the mechanical errors in AMS, in many more instances, though with varying consistency, they obscure Cooper's acceptable, if at times unconventional , accidental forms. For example, the printers regularly capitalize his lower case "state" (in reference to the American political division) and use the lower case for his capitalized "Street" (as in "Wall Street"); they print his "favor" as "favour" and his "any thing" as "anything"; and they often normalize his characteristic treatment of the comma, by which it functions only sporadically in its familiar grammatical role of signaling such things as the distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses but persistently as an indicator of the pauses that a speaker might make, almost in the manner of phrase-marks in a musical score. The styling of Cooper's text by the compositors extends to his words and word-order . They frequently tinker with his prepositioned idioms, as when they change "edifice in stone" to "edifice of stone" at 1.16.26; they update his verb forms, as when they change "sprung" to "sprang" at 1.50.17; they fuss with his connectives, as when they change "Then" to "Besides" at 1.212.24 or "for" to "as" at 1.413.4; and they rearrange his adverbs, as when they change "got subsequently" to "subsequently got" at 1.52.16. But beyond such piddling refinements and wholly apart from the hundreds of compositorial misreadings of AMS is a large class of substantive variants in the uncorrected proof (subsequently referred to as PR) that can only be seen as attempts by the printers to re-write Cooper. These variants have nothing to do with styling, nor are they forms that have any visual resemblance to those of AMS. Rather, they are free inventions, apparent efforts to improve upon the author. Thus AMS "named" becomes "called" in PR (1.50.26), "in that day" becomes "at that time" (1.55.12), "steeples" becomes "spires" (1.55.22), "senses" becomes "soul" (1.60.10), "square-built" becomes "square-rigged" (1.62.11), "direct" becomes "enclose" (1.68.17), "portion" becomes "part" (1.77.25), "threshing" becomes "good threshing" (1.78.18), "passage" becomes "voyage" (1.80.21), "oddities" becomes "peculiarities" (1.81.1), "the tale" becomes "it" (1.82.12), "in the spring" becomes "early in the spring" (1.82.17) and "as soon as" becomes "at the time" (1.92.4). These examples are drawn from just two of the thirty chapters of Part 1, but they are representative in kind of this whole class of variants. All of the extant proof of Afloat and Ashore except that for the first seven paragraphs of the Preface to Part 1 is marked with notations—corrections, queries, and occasional comments—made distinctly in black ink and written in a hand that is clearly John Fagan's. Fagan's copy-editing (hereafter referred to as FPR) performs a number of different functions. For one thing, it corrects many printer's errors, most of them typographical, such as the use of the wrong font, the misalignment of type, or the setting of an inverted letter. Some of those corrections, as when FPR supplies AMS text that the compositor has dropped, could only have been made by reference to the manuscript. The many occasions on which Fagan overlooked compositorial departures from AMS, however, suggest that he did not read the proof against the manuscript but only consulted the manuscript when he encountered obvious anomalies in PR. In addition to making corrections, Fagan continues in proof the process of styling that the compositors had initiated in PR, attending to spelling, capitalization, and punctuation and making a few minor substantive changes on his own authority, such as replacing PR "as much as" with "so much as" at 1.115.27-116.1, PR "quick" to "quickly" at 1.357.15, and PR "sung" to "sang" at 1.370.16. But nowhere does FPR embody the bold substantive changes to Cooper's language that PR so frequently (and silently) does. Rather Fagan almost always poses substantive changes as proposals or queries, at times only underlining the forms that he regards as questionable and at others both underlining the form and suggesting an alternative in the margin along with the abbreviation "qr." The queries that he addresses to the author range from such small matters as changing PR "dove" to "dived" at 1.362.5 (a proposal that Cooper rejected) to issues of plot and character: at 1.453.14-16, for example, he marks Miles' joke about the width of Neb's grin during the battle with the Malay pirates and then comments marginally, "This remark seems scarcely to consist with the gravity of Wallingford" and at 1.455.13 he underlines Miles' mention of the Bay of Naples, querying, "Will Wallingford see Naples?" Although Cooper usually responds to Fagan's stylistic queries by revising the text, he never makes changes in response to Fagan's comments on his narrative, and some he strikes out with a thoroughness that suggests a degree of fury.</field>
