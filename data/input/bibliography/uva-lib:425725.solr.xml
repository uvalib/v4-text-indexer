      <field name="heading_text">Historicism and Critical Editing by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All scholarly editors must decide to what extent the texts they present in their editions can be permitted to depart from the documentary texts that have come down to them; no more basic theme runs through the history of scholarly editing than the perennial debates over the role of editorial judgment (necessarily subjective, to a greater or lesser degree) in the production of responsible texts. Even those who acknowledge the value, under certain circumstances, of critical texts (that is, texts incorporating the results of critical judgments as to whether alterations are required) sometimes wish to restrict as much as possible the operation of individual judgment. They may say, for instance, that emendations should be limited to the correction of what are thought to be printers' errors in a given text and should not be drawn from the variant readings of other texts, which represent different stages in the history of the work. Critical editing by definition moves one away from documentary texts, because it admits the possibility of emending those texts. This process need not be unhistorical, for the scholarly goal of emendation is to recreate texts that once existed, even if in some details they existed only in their authors' minds. But the fact remains that critical texts (if emendations have actually been made in them) do depart from the particular texts that have survived from the past; and any recreation of something that does not exist is conjectural and inevitably reflects, to some degree, later attitudes. These issues—which, taken together, might be called the question of historicism—have been discussed at length by generations of editors, and they will always be discussed. It comes as no surprise, therefore, to recognize that they have been prominent in editorial debate in the early 1980s; but they have, I think, been approached in these years from some neglected directions, offering new twists to old dilemmas. This trend in editorial theorizing is not unrelated to what has been happening in scholarly literary criticism. Although recognition of the interdependence of textual scholarship and literary criticism has not advanced as far as one could wish, there is no doubt that recent writers have increasingly explored the connection. Editors have always known implicitly that any actions they took as editors reflected particular assumptions about the nature of literature and of verbal communication; but over the years they have not been inclined to confront this fact very explicitly. An age of criticism that has emphasized theory, however, has naturally provided a setting in which editorial discussion becomes more self-conscious regarding the theory of literature underlying it. That editors must be critics and that critics must understand textual history are truisms just beginning to be understood beyond a small circle of scholar-critics. The elements of a new historicism emerging in literary study have recently been usefully surveyed by Herbert Lindenberger, 1 who contrasts the "suspiciousness and self-conscious playfulness" of the new history with the "detachment and self-effacement" of the old, pre-New Criticism, variety. One of the reasons for this shift of tone, he suggests, is directly connected with textual scholarship: the theoretical questioning of the organic unity of individual works has been supported by some of the evidence produced by editors, evidence showing (as he says the Cornell edition of The Prelude of 1798-99 shows) that a literary work "consists essentially of layers of text—often, in fact, unfinished layers—none of which necessarily commands more authority than the others." This line of thinking leads to suspicion of "authorial authority" (p. 17) 2 and in turn to rejection of "objectivity" and "permanence" as attributes of historical scholarship (p. 22). Another link between critical and textual work is the recent critical interest in reading (that is, in readers' "responses"), which encourages a concern with the texts available to readers in the past and the reception accorded them (p. 20). Although Lindenberger's account does not emphasize textual matters, it does illustrate some of the ways in which developments in critical and in editorial theory and practice have begun to feed each other. The new historicism in textual matters that I wish to examine has a somewhat different emphasis, however. After all, the "new history" Lindenberger describes is new in part because it recognizes the importance of historical context in literary analysis and comes after a period in which historical considerations were slighted. But textual study has always been, and is in conception, historical. The recent concern with historicism among editorial theorists does not result from a rediscovery of the value of historical research (which was never lost) but from new approaches to the nature of literature that dictate new limitations on an editor's freedom to be eclectic. In the pages that follow, I propose to examine the literature of editorial theory of the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s from this point of view. This report is conceived as a continuation of my previous surveys of recent editorial discussion. 3 That its focus is on historicism reflects the way the field has developed, for the most significant discussions of the last five or six years can profitably be examined in terms of their stance on this issue. I begin with some discussions (largely by historians) that cannot be considered to have advanced editorial thinking but that are representative of an unsophisticated attitude toward historicism still often encountered. I shall then turn to the two extreme positions that define the recent debates: the view that literature is social and collaborative in nature and therefore that the historical forms in which a work was presented to the public are of primary significance; and, at the other end of the spectrum, the view that literary works are the products of discrete private acts of creation and therefore that their essential forms do not include alterations by others nor even later revisions by the authors themselves. Finally I shall look at some efforts to assert the validity of multiple texts, recognizing that different historical interests may require different approaches to editing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I What I am calling a debate about historicism has chiefly engaged the editors of writings by literary figures, not the editors of statesmen's papers and other historical documents. The reason is that the debate is primarily concerned with critical editions, in which the principles underlying an editor's emendations determine how far the critical text departs from the documentary text 4 that served as its basis. Historians 5 have not generally dealt with these issues because the material they have typically edited consists of letters, journals, and other similar manuscripts, which are more likely to call for literal transcription than critical emendation. For them, the issue of historicism in editing is apt to be whether eclectic texts (products of critical editing) can ever be preferred to diplomatic transcriptions of single documentary texts. Even though many historical editors have practiced critical editing in the sense that they have normalized or regularized certain features of their texts, and have not simply produced diplomatic transcriptions, many of them have not been able to see the value of the further step that literary editors have often taken when dealing with multiple texts of a single work, the step of emending one text with variants from another. Not having progressed beyond this elementary stage in the process of thinking about editing, they have not been in a position to enter into the more sophisticated discussions of historicism in critical editing. It is an unfortunate fact that what historians have published on the subject of editing has not contributed to the development of editorial theory. 6 Just prior to the period under review here, in September of 1978, a Conference on Literary and Historical Editing was held at the University of Kansas, under the joint sponsorship of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. That such a conference took place was encouraging, for it was the first organized effort to open the lines of communication between literary and historical editors. 7 But the title of the conference, like the title of the 1981 volume collecting some of the conference papers, Literary &amp; Historical Editing (edited by George L. Vogt and John Bush Jones), was misguided in suggesting that the nature of editing shifts at disciplinary boundaries (assuming they can be located). It is perhaps permissible, if not very felicitous, to speak—in convenient short-hand—of "literary editors" and "historical editors," when referring to the editors who deal with the writings of literary 8 and historical figures; but it is surely illogical to speak of "literary editing" and "historical editing," as if differences in editing arise more from the subjects involved than from the kinds of materials. Letters pose similar problems, if they are from the same period and country, whether they are written by statesmen or by novelists; 9 and works published in a series of editions pose a different set of problems, regardless of whether the author is a politician or a poet. I endeavored to make this point in my contribution: although it was entitled "Literary Editing" (pp. 35-56) because that was the assigned topic, it explained that the real distinction is between writings of the kind normally intended for publication and those of the kind normally not so intended (critical editions often being most appropriate for the former, diplomatic transcriptions for the latter). Blurring this distinction in the title and organization of the conference was effectively to discourage participants from recognizing the extent of their shared concerns. The paper that represented "historical editing"—at the conference and in the volume—set forth a viewpoint, largely through implication, that has not yet died out from its own illogic and therefore must be glanced at here. George C. Rogers, Jr., entitled his paper "The Sacred Text: An Improbable Dream" (pp. 23-33) and seemed by the title to be implying that too much attention can be paid to texts, an interpretation borne out by his reaction to an essay of mine: "The text, the text, it is always the text!" (p. 33). One gathers that he believes textual details to be less important for historical than for literary scholars, for he seems to think that the former deal with ideas (and are presumably above such minutiae), whereas the latter deal with language. This astonishing position (which, I hasten to add, Rogers is not alone in holding) is apparently what underlies his statement that the "work to preserve the words of the founding fathers . . . provides us with an understanding of our republic," whereas "the work to find out what Shakespeare himself had to say" provides us "with an understanding of our language" (p. 27). On this basis, presumably, he can report with approval that the texts in the Papers of Henry Laurens incorporate silent alterations to increase "readability"—dashes, for example, are deleted "unless it is obvious that they should be retained as they would be in modern writing," and commas are added "only when the editors are sure that the addition will clarify the meaning of a passage" (p. 29). More important to him than offering a record of such alterations is the provision of historical annotation, for a textual apparatus "tends to confine thinking to the text at hand" (mere language, that is), but annotation "tends to release thinking in a thousand new directions" (p. 31). The connection between nuances of language (including punctuation) and nuances of thought is not made, and thus there is no recognition of the fact (which follows from it) that textual details are of equal importance to all who wish to read with the fullest understanding, regardless of the nature of the writings to be read. Much of Rogers's paper—after an introductory section explaining incorrectly what literary editors do 10 —sets forth the practices of the Laurens edition, as an example of what historical editors do. But nothing in that account explains how the "work to preserve the words of the founding fathers" (or other historical figures) is furthered by concealing certain details of the manuscripts (and depriving readers of the opportunity to arrive at their own evaluations of the significance of those details); 11 nor is any coherent rationale offered for preferring annotation, however stimulating, to information about the words and punctuation of the text itself, the text presumably being the reason for the existence of the edition. 12 Rogers's Kansas paper makes no contribution to editorial thinking nor—unfortunately, given the occasion for which it was prepared—to the promotion of mutual understanding among editors in different fields. 13 Resuscitating it here is no doubt unkind; but its essential position, however ineptly set out in this instance, continues to be argued. Two years later, at the Williamsburg conference of the Association for Documentary Editing (which had been founded a few weeks after the Kansas conference, with the same goals), Robert J. Taylor still found alterations for the sake of readability to take precedence over the presentation of literal transcriptions. 14 He claims that the inclusion in the edited text of "inconsequential" authorial deletions, "incomprehensible" authorial punctuation, and "superfluous" authorial dashes "could well annoy a modern reader" and that "reader annoyance itself could block the reader from sensing a writer's mood" (p. 5). It does not seem to have occurred to him that any serious reader will be more annoyed by an editor's officiousness in withholding documentary evidence and will find incredible the idea that the "burden of proof" should be on those who introduce no alterations rather than on those who do. 15 Curiously, Taylor presents an excellent statement explaining why anyone who is bothered by unfamiliar or inconsistent spelling and punctuation reveals thereby "an unhistorical attitude"—for he does not see that this point demolishes his own argument. He proceeds to say that "slavish copying" can sometimes "get in the way of the meaning of the words and the spirit of the document" and that the "main objective" is "the illumination of history" (p. 6). We thus come back to the same basic misunderstanding that was present in Rogers's paper, but Taylor is more explicit: "the aesthetic interest is central in the study of literary documents," whereas the "overriding concern" in the study of historical documents is "their contribution to the understanding of history" (p. 6); therefore "the principle of the sanctity of the text" is "not necessary for many, perhaps most, of the documents that an historical editor works with" (p. 7). Aesthetics has nothing to do with the issue, of course; what is being missed here is the simple fact that a careful reading of any piece of writing involves attention to details of wording and punctuation, whether or not the writer is generally considered to be an effective user of the language. 16 Those inclined to agree with the views expressed by Rogers and Taylor often make a further point, which in fact renders their brand of historicism rather paradoxical. They are likely to disapprove of eclectic texts on the grounds—as Taylor puts it—that such texts have "no historical validity," not having "a real existence" and not representing "what was" (p. 7). Wayne Cutler has concisely stated this position by saying that "the historical editor speaks only for one document at a time"; "conflation," he says, "breaks down the time factor that is so important in linking written witnesses to particular past events." 17 These editors therefore put themselves in the peculiar position of saying that one loses the evidentiary value of individual documents by any conflation of the texts of two or more of them but that certain kinds of editorial alteration within the texts of single documents are permissible, and indeed can even assist readers in seeing the historical significance of those documents. An additional irony is that the editors who produce eclectic texts generally provide records of variants and emendations (thus recognizing the importance of documentary evidence), whereas those who favor individual documentary texts often (especially in the field of history) furnish no detailed records of their normalizations (thus suggesting a less rigorous concern with such evidence). But the issue should not be how important documentary evidence is: obviously it is fundamental, whether or not one decides to take the next step and make critical use of that evidence. Some editors who do not wish to take that step, however, are not willing to think about its potential usefulness. The result is the sad spectacle of scholars asserting—sometimes with a touch of pride—their own closed-mindedness. Cutler unfortunately serves as an example: To what uses literary critics may put bastard documents is for them to say, but the saying of the same will not likely change the historical discipline's rules of evidence and citation. I am far from being convinced that a common definition of terms would inform our dissimilar approaches to editing, for it may well be the case that on the subject of methodology we have little of consequence to exchange. (p. 9) It would be a great misfortune if editorial discussion were to stall for long at this level. Yet attempts to deal with the supposed differences between "historical" and "literary" editing persist in getting off the track. An egregious instance is Claire Badaracco's proposal for a paper for the first conference (1981) of the Society for Textual Scholarship. 18 One can readily concur in her dissatisfaction with the use of the words "historical" and "literary" to designate two kinds of editing, but it is hard to see what is gained by her substitution of "documentary" and "textual," based on "principles emerging from one's philosophical stance in relation to the problem of VALUE" (p. 43). When she explains that "textual" editors 19 value "the author's intention," whereas for "documentary" editors "it is not the text but the document itself which is of the greatest value" (p. 42), she is merely perpetuating a misguided approach, adding to it some new confusions. Her piece would not be worth mentioning except that it elicited from Fredson Bowers a splendid reply, which in memorable fashion cuts through to the heart of the whole question and says what needs to be said. Naturally the reporting of evidence is central. Bowers concisely makes the essential criticism of historical editors' common practice of omitting any record of the authorial deletions and revisions present in the texts of the documents being transcribed: "All one can ask is, Is this documentary?" (p. 65). 20 These editors, he notes, have repeatedly "turned a blind eye to the superior possibilities for the transmission of information that have come to characterize the new school of editing making its way in the humanities" (p. 49). The emphasis is on the "possibilities for the transmission of information," not on the nature of the edited text, since "for the purposes of historical interpreters it may be moot whether an eclectic conflated text made up from multiple authorities is better suited than a transcript of a single document, provided in both cases an apparatus records the variants" (p. 66). Critical editors, Bowers rightly insists, place just as much value on documentary evidence as diplomatic editors do, but the kind of edition they generally construct, containing both a critical text and an apparatus, meets the varying interests of different audiences and releases the editor from being "the victim of the requirements of only one segment of an audience" (p. 73). Bowers's essay—as this brief summary of a few key points suggests—deserves a wide readership among those who have had suspicions about the scholarly seriousness of critical editors in the field of literature and who have not been able to see that all who deal with texts confront the same problems. The observations he makes are in fact self-evident, as he several times suggests; but past debate does not give one grounds for hope that they will be soon understood, in spite of his effective statement to ease the way. Even David Hall, who is particularly interested in the history of books and reading, found it possible in his 1983 Wiggins Lecture to refer sarcastically to "the work of analytical bibliographers and their holy of holies, the text." 21 The depth of his misunderstanding is revealed by his further saying, "The very concept of a perfect text is an invention of the twentieth century, and cannot be imposed upon the past" (p. 335). 22 Students of the history of reading and of the role of books in society are rightly interested in the texts available to readers at particular times in the past; but so are students of the history of literature, and no critical editor of a literary text would pretend that a newly constructed critical text (as opposed to its apparatus) would be appropriate for analyzing earlier readers' reactions. 23 Whether historians are in fact as concerned with past texts as they ought to be is a question one cannot avoid raising, if Rogers's exasperated exclamation "always the text!" and Hall's slighting reference to "holy of holies" are at all representative of a common feeling. The truth of the matter is that, because analytical bibliography developed primarily among literary scholars, many historians have not yet come to understand the lessons it has taught about the role of physical evidence in uncovering textual problems (lessons relevant to the study of manuscripts as well as of printed books) and therefore have not recognized that the task of identifying "the text" read at a given time is often more complicated than the simple location of a single copy. Indeed, the growing numbers of historians interested in what is often referred to (following the lead of the French in this field) as histoire du livre , dealing with books in their broadest social contexts, have surprisingly often failed to see how important analytical bibliography and textual study are for their endeavors. 24 Despite extensive discussion of these matters in recent years, encouraged in part by the activities of two organizations devoted to fostering interdisciplinary communication among scholarly editors, the split between literary and historical editors regarding the responsible handling of historical evidence has not grown significantly smaller. That so much energy has been invested in debating such elementary—such essentially undebatable—points is regrettable; there are, after all, real issues waiting to be further explored. No one doubts the importance of making transcriptions or reproductions of the texts of certain individual documents (both manuscript and printed); and it seems scarcely credible that anyone would question the desirability, in connection with such transcriptions or reproductions, of reporting as much as possible of the textual evidence those documents contain. 25 Similarly undebatable, one would think, is the idea that in certain instances a further usefulness might result from the production of a text embodying alterations made at the editor's discretion 26 (with the alterations recorded). 27 Both literary and historical editors acknowledge this point, but some do so only in a limited way. Many editors who disapprove of eclectic texts nevertheless produce critical texts, for they make certain kinds of alterations, aimed at bringing a text to what in their judgment is a higher standard (whether of readability, mechanical correctness, correspondence to the author's intention, or something else). Any editor who normalizes or modernizes a documentary text is obviously engaging in critical editing, for the resulting text departs from all the historical witnesses through the operation of the editor's critical judgment. Some of these editors balk at the idea of drawing any of their alterations from another text of the same piece of writing, labeling such a practice "eclectic" and charging that it destroys the integrity of individual documents. But that integrity has already been violated by the editor's own intrusions; "eclecticism" only alludes to a particular source of such violation. No one would argue that editors have any obligation to produce eclectic texts when they find such texts inappropriate; but surely editors who understand the usefulness of even one kind of departure from absolute fidelity to a documentary text can also conceive of the usefulness, under some circumstances, of such eclectic texts. Whatever the field, scholars must engage in interpretation of the raw materials of history, and eclectic texts are one product of such interpretation. 28 Literary scholars may have more occasions for producing them than scholars in other fields; but it seems inconceivable that any scholar can fail to comprehend the rationale for and function of such texts. Yet that is precisely what much of the argument has been about. We are not talking here about which materials are most appropriate for eclectic treatment or what the principles for emendation ought to be but simply whether eclectic texts can ever be justified as historical scholarship. Clearly they can be: critical (including eclectic) texts have a place in the scholar's repertory as surely as diplomatic texts do. And in either case the scholar has an obligation to report the details of the documentary evidence. On this level, there is nothing to debate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The more interesting and potentially fruitful discussions of textual theory begin at the point where these unsophisticated complaints of historical editors leave off. They start from an acceptance of the value of eclectic texts and consider the problem of historicism from a higher plane. The issue is not whether eclectic texts as a genre are defensible but how best to produce them: when to be eclectic, how much departure from a documentary form of a work is allowable and desirable, whether editors should introduce emendations of their own in addition to readings drawn from other texts, and what principles or standards should underlie alterations of either kind. Discussions of these matters are usually concerned with works of the kind normally intended for publication (usually, in fact, with works actually published, after the fashion of their times), for critical editing is more likely to be of service in connection with such works than with private writings. How one conceives of the nature of such works and what concept of authorship it entails are therefore crucial questions, the answers to which determine the goal one is aiming toward in making alterations to a documentary text of a work. One family of answers to these questions proceeds outward from the author to the author's social context, tending to make authorship more a social than a private activity and sometimes expanding the concept of text. In some of his recent work, D. F. McKenzie has been moving in this direction, calling for a "sociology of the text." For instance, the paper he presented at a 1977 Wolfenbüttel symposium (the proceedings of which were published in 1981) 29 deals with "Typography and Meaning" and argues, as one illustration of the connection, that Congreve's altered treatment of scene divisions and stage directions in his collected Works of 1710 was inextricably tied up with their typographic presentation, which resulted from "a new and intimate form of teamwork" (p. 110) between Congreve and his publisher (and friend) Jacob Tonson. McKenzie is saying, in other words, that in this instance features of a printed book that are often regarded as nontextual cannot in fact be separated from the words and punctuation in considering the author's textual intentions. Congreve is a particularly interesting case, for the contrast between the original quarto editions of his plays and the Works of 1710 marks the transition between the seventeenth-century " dis junction of playwrights and printers" (p. 82), which resulted in printed forms "insensitive to the problems of mediating a theatrical experience" (p. 83), and the eighteenth-century effort to give "typography a voice in the hand-held theatre of the book," which made the printed form more than a makeshift report of something that had its real existence elsewhere. Despite the special circumstances of the Congreve example, McKenzie intends it to be emblematic of a broader point, not limited to Congreve, the eighteenth century, or printed drama: that the book itself is "an expressive means," in which "the substance of the text" cannot be divorced from "the physical form of its presentation," for the book conveys "an aggregation of meanings both verbal and typographic" (p. 82). As he concisely puts it, "A book's total form is itself a significant historical statement" (p. 99). In support of this generalization he offers a wide-ranging survey, filled with characteristically acute observations. 30 No one, I think, would dispute the view that every detail of a printed book carries historical meaning, though few critics have adequately integrated the evidence offered by format, paper, type design, and page layout into their readings of works, and McKenzie is quite right to stress the seriousness of this failing. 31 But we can all agree that readers' responses are affected by typography and book design without feeling that such features of books are necessarily inseparable from the works conveyed by the books. The issue turns on whether one is willing to admit the legitimacy of being interested in the artistic intentions of authors as private individuals rather than as social beings accommodating their intentions to various pressures emerging from the publishing process. On this fundamental question McKenzie wavers, and his imprecision weakens the foundation of an essay that is admirable in so many ways. A distinction has to be made between the books that were available to be read and reacted to at particular times in the past and the forms of works as intended by their authors. If one wishes to reconstruct how earlier readers reacted or to analyze their written reactions, there is no doubt that the physical features of the books they read are relevant and can in that sense be considered part of the "texts." But if one is more concerned with assessing a writer's mind and ideas than in examining how they were perceived by the contemporary reading public, some or all of the elements of book design may be nontextual, if the writer was not interested in them or did not put any of them to special use. Even in these cases, a scholar should not ignore such features of original printings, for they are part of the historical setting; 32 but the physical arrangement of the scholar's critical text need not be affected. Situations will vary: there are writers, as Congreve apparently was, who are so intimately involved with the design of the printed presentation of their works that the design (or some parts of it) must be regarded as textual; for other writers, the design does not reflect authorial intention. Critical editors must judge which is true in each case, just as they must make judgments about words and punctuation. McKenzie's essay suffers from not being built on this distinction. 33 His insistence on the necessity of eclectic texts, for example, is confusing in the context of a concern with the "sociology" of the text. In discussing Congreve's revisions for the 1710 Works , he says that an editor "must seek to serve the play at its fullest and best 34 by restoring a reading when he believes its suppression to reflect a narrow moral, rather than a literary, judgement on Congreve's part": "Conflation is inevitable" (p. 109). Although his defense of eclectic editing is well stated, it is likely to leave readers puzzled. Congreve's self-censorship, he believes, resulted sufficiently from "external pressures" (p. 107)—legal constraints on coarse language and Tonson's attitude toward it—to justify an editorial decision to restore the canceled language; but such a decision emphasizes the author's own wishes over the product that emerged from the social process of publishing. Of course McKenzie is right to assert that responsible textual decisions must be based on an understanding of the "complex of attitudes—personal, social and trade—" (p. 109) that lie behind variant readings; presumably he is referring to the same broad range of considerations later when he says that variants should be "interpreted in the context of book trade history" (p. 117). Editors must naturally be as informed as possible about all aspects of the historical context; but being so informed does not determine what view of authorship they should take as a basis for textual decisions. For in many—no doubt in most—instances one cannot accommodate both the private wishes of the author and the collaborative product of the publishing process simultaneously. 35 If McKenzie can speak of interpreting variants in the light of book-trade history and still opt in the case of Congreve (who worked closely with his publisher) for restoring readings that the author deleted under the publisher's influence, then he is not claiming that one must necessarily give preference to the historical product of the book trade (the "historical statement" conveyed by a "book's total form"). 36 He is saying only that editors' knowledge should include book-trade and typographical matters, and he does not go on to confront the fact that more than one responsible approach to critical editing can be followed by editors who have this knowledge. What he recommends for Congreve is the same, in the end, as what many of the editors who are considered followers of Greg would have done in this situation. All McKenzie is really saying is that editors have frequently had insufficient historical knowledge to recognize the textual role that typography can play. It may be fair to call this lack a "failure of historical imagination," but it is an overstatement to assert that "most recent work in textual bibliography" (p. 105) is guilty of it, for editors routinely consider which (if any) typographical features of the printings of an author's work must be defined as textual; and a decision not to classify them as textual, in an edition focusing on authorial intention, does not necessarily signify that the editor has failed to take the whole book, or the whole historical context, into account. McKenzie's misunderstanding of Greg's rationale 37 has led him to think that "current theories of textual criticism" are "quite inadequate to cope" with the connections between typography and meaning; actually there is no theoretical problem on this score at all, and the value of McKenzie's piece is rather to have provided us with some illuminating examples of these connections and to have reminded us forcefully how essential a knowledge of typographic and book-trade history is to editors (not to mention other things they must know). He makes no case in this piece for the necessity of what he grandiosely calls "a new and comprehensive sociology of the text" (p. 118). But in his impressive Presidential address to the Bibliographical Society five years later, he more calmly and more stimulatingly defines the "sociology of texts," not in relation to a supposed crisis that it can rescue us from but as the "substance of bibliography" (p. 365), thus expanding bibliography to include the study of orality, literacy, and "the recording function of memory" (p. 333). 38 His encompassing view enables him to offer one of the most eloquent testimonies we have to the indispensability of textual eclecticism in reaching some understanding of the past, showing that it in no way violates "historicity" (p. 334). 39 Even those bibliographers who feel uncomfortable with the idea of becoming anthropologists (as well as sociologists) will come away from McKenzie's humane manifesto with an enriched understanding of their role as textual historian-critics. 40 Although McKenzie's position emphasizes the social settings in which authors work, it does not deny the primacy of unconstrained authorial intention as a guide for critical editing. Others who focus on the social side of authorship go farther and believe that the collaborative nature of the publishing process makes artificial any attempt to isolate an author's uninfluenced intentions. Jerome J. McGann has become the most prominent advocate of this point of view, particularly as a result of A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983). 41 He attacks the approach developed by Bowers (and derived from Greg) for editing works of the last two centuries because it emphasizes authorial intention; he believes that it has "tended to suffocate textual studies" by limiting them to a narrow "psychological and biographical context" (pp. 119-120). In its place he calls for an editorial theory that would recognize literary works to be "fundamentally social rather than personal" productions (p. 8). Locating authority in authorial intentions, he says, causes works to be seen in "the most personal and individual way," and "the identity of the author with respect to the work is critically simplified through this process of individualization": The result is that the dynamic social relations which always exist in literary production—the dialectic between the historically located individual author and the historically developing institutions of literary production—tends to become obscured in criticism. Authors lose their lives as they gain such critical identities, and their works suffer a similar fate by being divorced from the social relationships which gave them their lives (including their "textual" lives) in the first place, and which sustain them through their future life in society. (p. 81) This passage sets forth, as effectively as any in the book, the view that "words do not by themselves constitute a system of communication" and that "literary works are not produced without arrangements of some sort." Thus, for him, the very existence of works (and not merely their publication) depends on collaborative effort: "the authority for the value of literary productions does not rest in the author's hands alone" (pp. 47-48). McGann's book serves a useful purpose in asserting the importance of seeing one's own scholarly endeavors against the background of the historical evolution of the field and in focusing renewed attention on the social context of literary production. The treatment of the latter is disappointing, however; the book does not achieve its aim of developing "a fully elaborated argument for a socialized concept of authorship and textual authority" (p. 8). Such a book would be valuable, for—despite increased interest in the historical study of the profession of authorship—scarcely any careful and thoughtful analysis has been made of the implications, for textual criticism, of the social structure of authorship. McGann does provide several interesting examples, often drawn from the writings of English Romantic poets, to illustrate some of the ways in which works become collaborative enterprises, and he offers from time to time variations on his fundamental observation that "an author's work possesses autonomy only when it remains an unheard melody" (p. 51); but he expends much of his energy on a criticism of the position of Bowers and those who, in one way or another, have followed his lead. Even if this criticism were well-founded, 42 it is hard to see how the discrediting of one approach amounts to a "fully elaborated argument" for another. The underlying assumption, of course, is that there are only two alternatives and that only one of them is valid. A far more productive way to proceed would be to recognize that a variety of approaches is justifiable and then to concentrate, with positive arguments, on the merits of the one under discussion. McGann obviously believes that the structure of modern publishing does not admit of any approach to authorship that stresses individual artistic creation and that to take such an approach would be a falsification of history. But surely it is a legitimate (and natural) historical pursuit to be interested in the minds of particular persons from the past, particularly if their writings (or other accomplishments) have any reason to command our attention. However much those writings as published and read were a collaborative effort, we are not being unhistorical in wanting to know just what the initiating mind contributed to that effort. The initiator, by virtue of being the initiator, is forever set apart from those who follow, however necessary they may have been for the completion of the act of communication (and, indeed, however beneficial we judge their ministrations to have been); and if we are concerned with more than one work "by" the same person because we feel that they may illuminate one another, the creating mind is the link between them. The attempt to establish what an author thought and wrote when not making concessions to pressure from others is an essential activity for understanding history. 43 But those who engage in it are not thereby denying the value of examining as well the forms of works that came off the presses and went into readers' hands. No one can reasonably claim (and I am not aware that anyone has tried to claim) that the texts of works as they in fact appeared in successive printings and editions over the years are not important for historical study or that publication is not a social process. The opposite in each case is a truism, and McGann in these respects is stating the obvious (which is not a bad thing to do). But it is equally a truism to say that intellectual (and thus literary) history is concerned with the private as well as the public, with the minds and ideas of individuals as well as with the transmutations of those ideas in their passage through the world. The two approaches are complementary and both are necessary, though one may be more appropriate than the other for certain purposes. These observations, I believe, provide the proper context for reading McGann's book; with them in mind, one immediately recognizes the fallaciousness or narrowness of many of his statements. It is ironic, given his emphasis on breadth and on the need to free textual study from constricting ideas, that his own position is narrow-minded in limiting the acceptable approaches to a single one. Studying literature as a social product is only superficially more inclusive than studying it as the product of a single creator, since one must explore all the same areas of concern in either case; but one is clearly taking a restricted view if one is not open to the values of both approaches. There is nothing wrong, of course, with being an advocate of one position, so long as one is not blinded to the contribution of the other. Insofar as McGann is committed to denying the usefulness of an author-centered conception of editing, his argument is doomed to failure; and his advocacy of a society-oriented one is weakened by his lack of balance. It also suffers from a lack of clarity. The role of authorial intention is central to the whole discussion, and yet at the end one does not quite know what McGann is suggesting about its place in editing. In an appendix called "A Possible Objection," he reports that a reader of his manuscript objected to his generalization that a first edition "can be expected to contain what author and publishing institution together worked to put before the public" (p. 125), by citing instances in which D. H. Lawrence was "an unwilling partner in a downright repressive process." One might well wonder how this is a "possible objection" to McGann's general line, for if a work achieves its existence through the interaction of author and publisher, then an expurgated work must be accepted as readily as one we might regard as improved, for both can be the result of the particular chain of historical events that constitute the publishing process. 44 But McGann surprisingly replies that the collaboration of author and publisher does not always turn out well and that "the editor must examine carefully the early publishing history in order to arrive at a reasonable decision" regarding the choice of a "textual version" (p. 127). 45 He adds that authorial intention is "only one of many factors to be taken into account, and while in some cases it may and will determine the final decision, in many others it cannot and must not be forced to perform that function" (p. 128). Similarly, he had earlier stated that "Shelley's manuscripts frequently assert a strong demand to be adopted as copy-text, whereas Byron's rarely do": despite the fact that Shelley "published in a fashion that was normal for his period," it would be "a disservice to Shelley's work . . . if a critical edition today neglected to consider, in the matter of copy-text, the sincerity and integrity of Shelley's manuscripts" (pp. 108-109). If McGann's point is that we should accept the results of the publishing process only when we feel that the work has benefited from it, we are then being asked to engage in a very different kind of editing, in which our choices are dictated by our personal preferences; the results may be admirable artistically but are not designed to increase readers' understanding of the past. 46 If he is saying that we are to follow a published text only when (or at those points where) the author can be thought to have sincerely approved of and desired it, then the focus is on authorial intention after all, and the procedure is not really different from the one that editors in the Bowers tradition have been using. They have habitually made judgments to distinguish which revisions made or suggested by others (whether publishers or other acquaintances) were fully accepted by the author in the spirit of active and welcome collaboration, and they have rejected only those revisions that the author appears to have accepted grudgingly or been forced into accepting. These editors have normally recognized the social side of authorship by acknowledging that an author's intentions can sometimes include the results of collaboration. Of course these matters require subjective judgments, based on historical evidence, but so do most decisions in critical editing. In the Bowers tradition, however, those judgments are made in a clear conceptual framework, with authorial intention at its center; but McGann offers no equally clear alternative, for he seems to waver in regard to what is at the center. It is not very helpful to be told that authorial intention is one of "many factors" to be taken into account and that sometimes it will be the "determining one": when the author's intentions and the publisher's actions are in conflict, what does one do? Naturally, one can go either way, but these are two different approaches to editing. McGann believes that "to see 'author's intentions' as the basis for a 'rationale of copy-text' is to confuse the issues involved" (p. 128); one should rather say that confusion is promoted by maintaining that an undefined mixture of two distinct approaches constitutes a useful rationale. 47 Clear thinking is better served by recognizing at the outset that individual desires and social pressures, though they may in specific instances be in harmony, are conceptually irreconcilable and that an editor's guiding principle in textual decisions must favor one or the other. It is understandable that many editors have regarded authorial intention as the more sensible choice for a scholarly critical edition, since one can argue that to represent the historical results of the publishing process a diplomatic edition or photographic facsimile would be preferable. But I do not mean to suggest that there are no possibilities in between: one could decide, for example, to accept all the publisher's alterations but to correct typographical errors, thus producing a critical text representing the publisher's intention; or one could decide to remove from the text of a single printing the textual features imposed on it against the author's wishes, thus producing a critical text reflecting the author's intentions at that particular time (regardless of any later authorial revisions). Such alternatives, however, have clear aims, giving priority either to the author's intentions or to outside influences. McGann's account contains no hint of this rational structure of possibilities within which critical judgment can operate purposefully. 48 The issue here is not subjectivity, for all critical editors—in the Bowers line or any other—make judgments (which are inevitably subjective) at every turn. It is difficult to understand why McGann thinks that "Giving up the rule of final intentions" will "introduce a subjective factor into the critical process" or that his proposal involves "the re-emergence of a 'subjectivity'" (p. 107), as if subjectivity had not always played a central role. 49 Because one of the factors influencing subjective decisions in a given instance is, he believes, the history of the previous editing of the work and what needs the present audience for the work has, it is not surprising that he welcomes modernizing as a legitimate scholarly activity. 50 He accuses those who reject modernizing of not understanding that all editions, even unmodernized ones, are—like all other literary efforts—time-bound, reflecting the concerns and attitudes of the age in which they were produced. All thoughtful people, including many scholarly editors, are perfectly well aware of this fact, but it is irrelevant. If one engages in historical scholarship, one is attempting, through an informed imaginative effort, to escape into the thinking of another time, even though one knows that the escape is never complete and that it will have to be reattempted by others in the future. Scholarly editors of critical editions do not really imagine that they are packaging up textual history for all time or preventing the further alteration of the text (see p. 93). But these realizations do not invalidate the effort of historical reconstruction. Modernized texts, like some kinds of critical essays, are attempts at elucidation, which may be more or less helpful to the readers of a given time; but those readers (even the "nonspecialist" ones) 51 who are interested in a work as testimony from the past will need to have the best results that historical scholarship has achieved in the recovery or imaginative reconstruction of particular texts and versions of that work. 52 McGann considers his discussion of modernized editions to be "the final phase of the argument" (p. 94), and it does epitomize his dual conviction that literary production is "not an autonomous and self-reflexive activity" (p. 100) and that critical editions, like all other works, are "always produced under the pressure of contemporary demands" (p. 96). But it also perpetuates the blurring of essential distinctions that permeates the book. One must deeply regret that a book offering the hope of a systematic exposition of a social view of authorship and its editorial implications must finally be judged to have left the issues more confused than clarified. 53</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III A convenient pairing was brought about the following year by the publication of Hershel Parker's Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons: Literary Authority in American Fiction (1984), 54 for that book locates the other pole of the debate over authorial intention and its place in the historical study of texts. Parker takes the position, with a vengeance, that authorial intention is central: he believes that the important intention is what authors manifest during the creation of works and that even authors' own later revisions often have no more right to become part of those works than the alterations initiated by others. His and McGann's books, therefore, serve to define the limits of the area under discussion. What they share is a sense of urgency about the need for a renewed historical orientation in literary studies and a conviction that textual criticism is central to literary criticism. From there on, of course, they are in contrast, and in more ways than one might anticipate. For McGann's book, despite its incoherence, calls attention to a fundamental theoretical issue, whereas Parker's book, though far better written and organized, is principally of interest for its detailed case histories, not because its basic thesis is of theoretical significance. Parker begins with the assumption that "All valid meaning is authorial meaning" (p. ix); 55 he is concerned not with arguing this general point but only with proceeding from it to a more precise definition of authorial meaning. Drawing especially on John Dewey's Art as Experience (1934) and Albert Rothenberg's The Emerging Goddess (1979), he describes the creative process as one that "begins, continues (as clinical observation records, with varying admixtures and sequences of excitement, arousal, boredom, anxiety, and determination), then ends—ends with stubborn finality" (p. 34). Because this process is "by nature determinate, revising authors very often betray or otherwise blur their original achievements in ways they seldom intend and seldom become aware of" (p. ix). He therefore concludes that Greg's rationale of copy-text is not an appropriate guide to the establishment of texts reflecting their authors' intentions because it assumes that authors' later revisions are, as a general rule, to be accepted in preference to the earlier readings. 56 According to Parker, "all empirical evidence should tell us that Greg is wrong, that in any mature human being, writers included, a state of indefinitely sustained arousal toward one object is unnatural" (p. 35). Thus authors' later revisions—as illustrated by a number of examples, particularly Henry James, Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, and Norman Mailer—may introduce inconsistencies (of detail, characterization, tone, or theme) and produce "maimed" texts. Critical editors, he believes, should not assume that "every author retains full authority over anything he has written for as long as he lives" (p. ix); they should instead reject later revisions that result in "unreadable texts" (p. x). This argument, as set forth by Parker, is not a helpful or clarifying one. The key to the problem is the fact that even if the creative process is granted to be "determinate," in the sense that it comes to an end, one is not provided by Parker with any historically oriented guideline for defining that ending point. It does not make sense, as he recognizes, to fix any quantitative limit: obviously one cannot say that any revision made within twenty-four hours, or three days, or six weeks, of the writing of the last sentence of a work emerges from the heat of the creative process, and that later revisions do not. 57 Even during what seems a single period of creative intensity, writers going back to an earlier paragraph may not be fully in tune with its context and may make revisions that seem to weaken or confuse the passage. Furthermore, as Parker admits, it is possible for some revisions to appear successful even though they were made at a time when one would assume the creative process to have ended. "No hard and fast limits can be drawn," he says, and he offers a few of the obvious reasons: "some writers have better memories than others" or refresh their memories with more rereadings of their works, and "a great deal always depends on how prolonged and overwhelming the creative process had been and how thoroughly the author is compelled to put it behind him and go on with a new work" (p. 40). The creative process is as various as are the temperaments of creators. Therefore none of Parker's generalizations about late revisions can be unqualified (he says that writers "very often"—but not always—"blur their original achievements"), for some late revisions are not inappropriate. If satisfactory revisions do sometimes occur after the creative process has ended, then clearly some factor other than the heat of sustained creativity is responsible for their success. Alternatively, one could define the creative process so as to include all satisfactory revisions; thus one could say that the existence of such revisions shows that the creative process had not yet ended at the time they were made. Either way, how has the introduction of the idea of a "determinate" creative process been of assistance? The focus of attention has been placed on distinguishing revisions that are satisfactory, or not inappropriate (or however one wishes to describe them), from those that are the opposite; and, it turns out, the concept of the creative process is not the analytical element that enables these distinctions to be made. What does underlie them is the editor's aesthetic judgment. Deciding whether a revision is successful (or satisfactory, or simply makes sense rather than nonsense) depends on individual judgment. Some revisions that produce clear inconsistencies are indubitably blemishes (when one can be sure that no authorial purpose is served by them), but many of the revisions that Parker discusses can be (and have been) the subject of disagreement as to their worth or effectiveness. The fact that he is asking editors to make literary value judgments is not in itself a problem, for all critical editing requires editorial judgments, which involve literary sensitivity. 58 Nor can one accuse him of simply telling editors to choose whatever variants happen to please them, for he explicitly couches his proposal in historical terms, with its goal the establishment of the author's—not the editor's—intended wording and punctuation. Yet on a more sophisticated level there is a sense in which this accusation is justified. One must remember that Parker is concerned only with revisions that authors made of their own free will; naturally those they were forced into making do not reflect their uninfluenced intention. The essential issue, then, is whether revisions that seem to the editor to introduce inconsistency or incoherence can be considered to represent the author's intention. Normally one is safe in assuming that authors do not intend to make their works incoherent or to make revisions that damage their works. But the kind of intention Parker is rightly concerned with is the intention in the act of writing, the intention to place a certain word or mark of punctuation next, not the intention to produce a particular effect. By definition, then, authors who make revisions of their own free will are producing intended texts (which may of course contain slips), even if those revisions, in the opinion of some or all critics, were executed with insufficient thought and are damaging in their effect. Everyone agrees that authors can make mistakes. But their revisions, however mistaken, are historical facts, and we cannot deny that unsatisfying versions of works are what authors have sometimes left to us as their finally intended texts. Parker believes that in such cases we should be concerned with the earlier intentions that produced better results. In effect, therefore, he is saying that—even as scholarly editors, who inform ourselves with historical facts—we should reject authorial revisions that do not strike us as successful. This position is not necessarily untenable, but we are not likely to be persuaded of its cogency by an argument enveloped in an irrelevant discussion of the creative process (interesting concept though it is). The more direct way to justify such an approach is to say that, if one is producing a critical text (in which the choice among variants involves the editor's judgment in any case), one should present the work in the most successful of the various forms dictated by the author's shifting intentions. (If the goal is to remain historically oriented, the editor must be limited by what the author wanted at some point, whether at the last stage of revision or not.) One way this decision has previously been approached 59 is in terms of whether a set of revisions can be judged to have turned a work into a different work (or an independent version): if grounds do exist for believing that particular revisions (regardless of their extent) affect a work so profoundly that the result ought to be thought of as a separate work, then one is free, if one chooses, to edit the earlier work rather than the later. This approach gives editors considerable scope for exercising their literary judgment—first, in making the subjective decision that the revisions produce a new work and, second, in valuing the earlier work more highly. But there is a great difference between this line of thought and Parker's, even though both rely on editors' aesthetic judgments. This one places those judgments squarely within a historical framework (admittedly, and necessarily, a subjective historical construct): one can reject later revisions if they appear to represent a new departure and turn a work in a new direction, for the result is being postulated as a historically separate entity requiring independent editing. If, however, one cannot make such a case, one must then consider the revisions as attempts to perfect or complete the work along the general lines already manifested in it, and one cannot reject some of them, simply because they seem misguided, if one's historical aim is the author's last intentions for each work (or aesthetically independent version). 60 Parker's approach, on the other hand, reverses the priorities and places the editor's aesthetic judgments above the historical succession of authorial revisions: those revisions considered by the editor to damage the work are not, in Parker's plan, allowed a place in a critical text meant to show the author's intentions. This way of proceeding involves shifting "final intention" in one of two ways: either the term means artistically final intention (however early or late such intention revealed itself) rather than the chronologically final intention of each independent version, or else it refers to the intended results, thus excluding revisions that do not, as they turned out, promote the intention of improving the work. In either case editors are asked to determine when authors' free-willed revisions were not in the best interests of their works and to construct their critical texts accordingly. It is not uncommon for critical editors to have to decide what authors "really" wanted, as opposed to what they actually did, in situations where their freedom of choice is suspect; but to protect authors from the literary consequences of their unconstrained textual decisions, as Parker recommends, is in fact to remove the author from the center of attention. The role of subjectivity in Parker's plan is thus fundamentally different from its place in the approach that requires—to justify the absence of late revisions from a critical text—a demonstration that they actually produced a new work (or an independent version, whichever one wishes to call it). Parker's rejection of that approach is characteristic of his reasoning. In discussing the 1907 text of James's The American , he asks whether a work can be "new" when "a good many lines at a stretch, occasionally, are wholly unrevised, while some other revisions respect the structure of a long paragraph while altering it stylistically sentence by sentence" (p. 107)—as if the presence of unrevised passages, or passages with unrevised structure, are incompatible with the existence of a different work. He later ridicules critics who seem to think that an author "confers meaning on a completed text with the wave of a hand or by ripping a book apart and reordering a hunk of it" (p. 218). When "hunks are re-used, unaltered or only slightly altered," he asserts, "what goes unrevised to a greater or lesser extent goes unrethought, unrestructured, carrying its original intentionality in a new context where that intentionality is more or less at war with the different intentionality in the altered or newly written passages" (pp. 228-229). These comments suggest a quantitative test, implying that a new work must be largely constructed of new sentences: "If unaltered or scarcely altered hunks of the original text remain in the later text, that later text is not truly a 'separate' one" (p. 229). Of course unaltered passages do sometimes clash with their new contexts, but at other times they do not. A writer may make only a few crucial changes in a work, leaving the rest unrevised, and yet the import of the whole may be changed; the unaltered passages will have taken on altered significance, and the fact that they are unaltered does not necessarily mean that they are "unrethought." Parker's firm belief that "textual meaning is not something living in a text" as an autonomous entity (p. 219) should be seen to argue against, not for, his view: a passage, not being autonomous, will not necessarily carry its original meaning into a new context. If it seems to fit successfully into the new context, are we to say it has been rethought and that the result is a new work? And if it does not, that it is unrethought and the result not a new work? Parker is really saying that a new work can come only from successful revision, making "new work" an evaluative term referring to a successful work. His argument seems to run as follows: writers infuse meaning into works in the process of composition; moving passages around is not a part of the composition process unless the shifted passages are thoroughly rethought; we can tell that they have been thoroughly rethought if they function well in their new contexts; if they do not function well, we cannot consider the new versions to be new works, regardless of the nature of the revisions that were made, but only botched versions of the original work. Ironically, if he could accept the idea that revisions can produce unsuccessful new works, he would have a stronger argument for offering—what he favors—a critical text containing unrevised readings. Parker's main thesis is built on a patent inconsistency. He repeatedly insists that the only meaning we should be interested in is what the author put into the text: we must think of the author as "a human being who worked meaning into the text line by line and page by page," for "authorial power is the only literary power there is" (p, 219). Nevertheless we are also told that authors frequently do not know when to stop revising their work and that what some of their revisions produce is nonsense rather than valid meaning: "the creative process, like any other process, has bounds, beyond which no author, however fine a craftsman, is apt to intervene with impunity" (p. 51). There is apparently a higher authority than the author, after all. Because Parker believes that unrevised passages in new contexts, not having been built up word by word anew, exemplify the doomed effort to prolong the creative process and are thus unlikely to succeed, he is scornful of authors and critics who claim—as in the instance of Tender Is the Night —that a rearrangement of sections has resulted in dramatic improvement. "It is," he says, "as if the right order were latent in what Fitzgerald wrote, awaiting only a magic touch to restore it to a platonic ideal which had had no reality during the years of composition" (p. 219). But Parker, too, has his platonic ideal, for he states that "the working assumption of any student of the creative process is that the direction of any developing aesthetic object is toward unity" (p. 217). The creative process has an end, and the work is then at its most unified, though authors do not always realize that they have reached this point and may try to make further improvements. Parker professes to put the author back into literary criticism: he deplores the tendency to see a work as "a verbal icon, a unique, perfect, and essentially authorless entity" (p. ix). But he also attacks the idea "that an author had the right to do whatever he wanted to do to his text" (p. 60), 61 and he believes that allegiance to the unity of the created work (whether or not we call it an "icon") finally takes precedence over a concern with what the author in fact did to the work. Parker surely senses the trap he has set for himself, for at one point he says that we often "revere" the creator and the icon at the wrong times, the creator "after he has gone from creator of his own work to merchandiser or promoter of it" and the icon "not in the form it had when the artist was most in control of it" (p. 49)—a statement that epitomizes all the inconsistencies of the argument, even while it almost acknowledges them. The theoretical scaffolding collapses; but we are left with a series of incisive discussions of individual works, showing how a knowledge of their compositional and publishing histories (including what can be inferred about them through close reading) brings one in touch with basic critical questions about each work. These analyses, along with similar ones that Parker has published separately, 62 stand on their own, and it is regrettable that he tried to erect a theory around them. He thinks of himself as promoting a new movement and wishes he had found a name for it, recognizing that his earlier term, "the New Scholarship," was not right (p. 241). 63 In fact his achievement is to have provided some telling examples of the connections between good textual scholarship and good criticism; no label is needed to dignify that accomplishment, and his awkward attempt at a unifying theory of the creative process only detracts from it. Once we see that Parker's approach actually moves away from the author, we should not be surprised to find that a reader-response critic takes the same general line. 64 Steven Mailloux is a rarity among such critics in feeling the need to discuss "Textual Scholarship and 'Author's Final Intention'"—as he entitles one chapter (pp. 93-125) of his book Interpretive Conventions: The Reader in the Study of American Fiction (1982). 65 He sees himself as offering a "third alternative" for the editor between the "originating view" of the author as an "isolated figure freely expressing his uniquely individual and privileged intention" and the "collaborative view of the writer as merely one among many text-producers": the "convention-based" view, in which authorship is a "convention-governed role" (and thus "socially constituted") but one that "individuals can take on" (p. 107). Although this approach combines some aspects of the other two, he considers one "advantage" of it to be that "it preserves scholarly editing's traditional emphasis on the 'author's intention'" (p. 108). There is no question that he takes the author's side when external pressure is involved; changes made under such pressure are invalid, he says, and editors are "fully justified" in rejecting them (p. 118). From there on he gets himself into the same predicament as Parker. Some revisions freely made by the author result in an "illogical or inconsistent restructuring of reader response" (p. 117), which "provides an aesthetic reason for giving the original version priority" (p. 120). In other words, "editors can take control of the intended text out of the author's hands if justified by an examination of historical evidence and the intended structure of the reader's response" (p. 121). 66 This approach "preserves" the "traditional emphasis" on authorial intention in a strange way, by shifting textual authority from author to editor (who is also a reader). Mailloux, in the end, makes editorial decisions the same way that Parker does, but he does not begin from the same premise, since he believes that "literary authorship is socially constituted" (p. 107). Here we have a social view of authorship that nevertheless sanctions editorial interventions on the supposed grounds of authorial intention. And thus have we come full circle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV These proposals to treat literature either as a social product or as the outcome of a private creative process are marred by various flaws of argument, but the weakness they share is their assumption that only one approach is valid. Editorial theorists who recognize (as most of them do) that a critical text is based on critical judgment should also see that no one critical text can be the best one from everyone's point of view or for all purposes. If there is a legitimate interest both in a writer's process of creation and in the vicissitudes that writings undergo in the process of initial and subsequent publication—as there obviously is for any historically minded person, since both are historical processes—then various approaches to textual criticism, emphasizing one or the other of these interests, must be acknowledged to be acceptable, depending on their own internal logic. Thoughtful editors have long recognized this point, and even if they have become advocates of a particular approach they have not denied the usefulness of multiple editions reflecting different approaches. 67 Yet the lure of the single text is so strong 68 that it has made many, perhaps most, editorial debates less fruitful than they might have been. Among recent writers on editorial matters, two—Hans Walter Gabler and Peter L. Shillingsburg—have particularly addressed themselves to the question of how to accommodate multiple texts of a work. For both of them a theory of literature supports the argument for the necessity of multiple texts; but they both also give serious thought to the practical matters of apparatus, because the chief problem for this capacious view is the challenge of adequately displaying variant readings. 69 Gabler's position, far less well thought out than Shillingsburg's, serves to focus some of the issues. In a paper for the 1981 Society for Textual Scholarship conference, 70 Gabler argues that we take too limited a view when we concentrate on the "synchrony" of a particular version of a work and that we ought to be alert to the "diachrony" of the evolutionary stages through which a work develops. We must distinguish, he says (and few would contradict him), between transmissional variants (which are deviations from what the author intended) and authorial variants (some of which are too often regarded as further deviations from an ideal text). The former should be corrected through emendation, but all of the latter, he believes, have a place in the literary work, which "may be said to comprise all its authorial textual states." What Gabler calls "a natural condition of the literary work" is "the manifest existence of discrete authorial versions of a text." In his pretentious language, the "total text" of a work "presents itself as a diachronous structure correlating the discrete synchronous structures discernible." The variant is not an "extraneous irritant" but an "integral textual element of pivotal significance in the textual totality of the work" (p. 309). One sees what he is getting at here, despite the expression and despite two serious conceptual flaws: first, he continually refers to transmissional errors in such a way as to suggest that it is no problem to separate them from authorial revisions, when of course making that distinction is in many instances a central editorial activity; 71 second, he repeatedly speaks of "discrete textual states" (even claiming that "there must always have been discrete textual states, in temporal succession, of a literary composition") without facing the fact that revision frequently does not proceed in readily separable "discrete" stages and that—when it does—such stages do not necessarily coincide with those represented by surviving documents. Having set forth this view of the nature of literary works, Gabler proceeds to outline a method for presenting the evidence, for he believes that the traditional apparatus is at odds with that view. Since "revisional variation" is "meaningful only in its contextual relations," we need to "devise modes of apparatus presentation which leave the contextuality intact": "Lemmatised fragmentation is categorically not suitable for the purpose" (p. 311). Instead, what "would seem an absolute necessity" is "some manner of 'integral apparatus' for the visualisation of revisional variance in invariant contexts, which in this case should display the work's entire shape, or sequence of variant shapes, in apparatus form before the critic's eye." Whatever form is chosen, it must not lose sight of "essential tenets, such as those of the situatedness in context of the revisional variant and its integrity to the work's total text" (p. 313). The point that emerges from this verbiage is that authorial variants, being part of the literary work, are more appropriately reported in the running text than in an appended list. He illustrates some of the possibilities, such as texts in parallel columns and the "synoptic" text he has adopted for Ulysses . However much Gabler wishes to make the presentation of variants a matter of theory, it remains a practical issue. All editors, whatever their theory of literature, recognize that variant readings, to be understood, must be placed in context; and when editors decide that the most suitable form of report under the circumstances is an appended list, they are not suggesting that the variants are somehow less significant than those that other editors choose to print (marked with various symbols) in the text. Readers who have used texts with integrated apparatuses (such, indeed, as the Ulysses ) know that they are not necessarily easier to follow than appended lists. 72 Gabler implicitly recognizes the difficulty of reading such texts when he provides for "an orientation text for the apparatus," or a "reading text" (p. 316), or even "the edition text" (p. 318). 73 But why, one is bound to ask, should there be a separate "reading" text if all the variants are an essential part of the work? Why should "the object of scholarly and critical analysis and study" (which is "the totality of the Work in Progress") be seen as "opposed" to "a general public's reading matter"? If the "work of literature possesses in its material medium itself, in its text or texts, a diachronic as well as a synchronic dimension" (p. 325), does it make sense for the "general public's reading matter" to be something less than the whole work? Is Gabler saying that scholars and critics need the real work, but ordinary readers can make do with what amounts to an abridged version, offering less than the full aesthetic pleasure that the work in its entirety provides? Gabler's position has obviously not been carefully thought through, but it is worth noticing here because it calls attention to questions that must be faced by anyone who hopes to defend the idea of multiple texts. Peter Shillingsburg handles these issues with far greater sensitivity. His book, Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age: Lectures in Theory and Practice (1984), 74 is so thoughtful and refreshing that one hesitates to mention its problems, for they (as opposed to the flaws in so many more limited efforts) do not stand in the way of the salutary effect it can, and should, have. Like Gabler, Shillingsburg believes that "literary works of art, unlike some other forms of art cannot safely be treated as single end-products" and that variants resulting from authorial revision form "an important part of a reader's experience of the work" (p. 31); 75 thus he, too, considers the handling of apparatus crucial to the reader's understanding. In contrast to Gabler, however, Shillingsburg bases his conclusions on a thorough reexamination of all the concepts that underlie textual and editorial work, and he does not limit his recommendations to a single approach. His rethinking of the whole process of editing gives weight to his recognition that the various approaches to editing, and the various approaches to literature from which they arise, are irreconcilable and must all be accepted. 76 He deplores the "single-mindedness of each school in thinking theirs is the higher course" and urges that editors "acknowledge, not the correctness, but the legitimacy of opposing viewpoints." Editors ought to "explore the felt needs that the different approaches seek to fulfill" and then to "create editions that at least acknowledge the potential of other approaches" (p. 73). Since a single critical text can represent only one approach, it falls to the apparatus to show that potential. Shillingsburg does not object to appended lists, but he strongly believes that variants should be identified more fully than they normally are in lists, associating each one not only with a "source document" but also with a "source agent (author, editor, compositor)" and a "source time" (p. 32). He argues that lists in which all variants, authorial and nonauthorial alike, are indistinguishably mixed do not encourage readers who are interested in a different approach to explore the evidence: "trivialized tables confirm critics in the habit of not using the apparatuses of critical editions because they cannot imagine what to use them for" (p. 75). 77 Shillingsburg's view here is analogous to Gabler's, both in its emphasis on the separation of authorial and nonauthorial variants and in its feeling that lists can sometimes make information seem less important than it is. Everyone naturally is in favor of making apparatuses as useful and convenient as possible, but whether the segregation of authorial from nonauthorial variants will always help readers is far from obvious: because the distinction between the two is by no means clear-cut and thus depends on critical judgment, readers will have to examine both categories in any case to determine whether their own judgment agrees with the editor's. And even when, as usual, only the documentary source of variants is identified in the apparatus, readers normally know—from the explanation of textual policy for the edition—the agent (or class of agent) 78 to whom the editor has attributed each type of variant in each document. I would not deny that in some instances dividing a long list of variants into categories could be helpful, but the gain does not seem as dramatic as Shillingsburg suggests; and it is hard to believe that readers who do not understand the purpose of apparatus in one form will readily see it when the form is shifted. The impulse to use apparatus is not instilled in readers by the inviting qualities of the apparatus but by those readers' habits of mind; readers who are interested in history will want to examine the evidence, and whatever form it is presented in will not deter them (though of course they are glad to have it in as convenient a form for their particular purpose as possible). One can accept Shillingsburg's advice on apparatus or not, as one chooses: the issue is one of convenience, not substance. His significant point is simply his emphatic reaffirmation of the essential function of apparatuses as supplements to reading texts. Justifying a reading text without interpolated variants poses less theoretical difficulty for Shillingsburg's position than for Gabler's. Although Shillingsburg does not deal directly with this matter, the rationale would be, I think, that in order to accommodate all approaches one has to recognize that for some of them alternative readings cannot be considered part of the text. Apparatuses, then, must be looked at in two ways, as Shillingsburg's varying manner of speaking about them suggests: they may be seen as recording "utterances that were or remain a part of the work" 79 or else as presenting "significant information about the work" (p. 75). Some readers will see them one way, and some the other. What Shillingsburg is saying could be reduced to the standard point that editors normally profess: apparatuses are crucial because they enable readers to take different approaches and make different judgments from the editors'. But this point has not always been made in a spirit of tolerance. Shillingsburg's contribution lies not in his advice on constructing apparatuses but in his restatement of an old truth in an uncommon context, one that stresses genuine openness to alternative approaches. He also makes a contribution in his sane review of the fundamental theoretical issues that all editors must take a position on. Even when they cannot fully agree with him, editors and other readers will benefit from working through his intelligent analyses of such matters as intention, ontology, and what he regards as the four basic approaches to editing. His discussion of intention, for example, is helpful in its emphasis on a writer's "intention to do" (that is, to write "a specific sequence of words and punctuation") rather than an "intention to mean" (pp. 27-29); but in the process Shillingsburg overstates the recoverability of the intended sequence of words and punctuation (he says it is "almost completely recoverable") 80 and underestimates the degree to which establishing an "intention to do" involves postulating an intended meaning. 81 In his chapter on "Ontology," Shillingsburg makes thoughtful distinctions among the concepts of work , version , draft , and text and shows how the entities envisaged in each case have no material existence, 82 though they may be stored in a physical medium (each instance of such storage being a document ). His discussion falters, however, in not accounting for the possibility that some literary works are also works of visual art (which therefore must be acknowledged to have a material existence) 83 and in not sufficiently confronting the fact that versions and drafts need not coincide with the texts of surviving documents. He states that a version "is represented more or less well or completely by a single text as found in a manuscript, a proof, a book, or some other written or printed form" (p. 36) and that drafts "are represented more or less well by the manuscripts containing them" (p. 38). The phrase "more or less" alludes specifically to the fact that texts can incorporate slips or errors not intended by the author to be part of a version or its drafts; 84 it does not seem also to refer to the fact that versions and drafts (in the abstract and, I think, appropriate sense employed by Shillingsburg) cannot be tied to the texts of physical documents. 85 Another chapter 86 enumerates the basic approaches to editing (or "orientations") as the "historical," the "aesthetic," the "authorial," and the "sociological." Much of what is said about them, as one would expect, is sensible; but the categories, as set out, are not entirely satisfactory. The "historical" approach includes texts with editorial emendations as well as diplomatic editions and facsimiles; how, then, does this approach differ from the "authorial" and the "sociological," both of which are critical and historical? 87 The "aesthetic" seems similarly to be blurred in conception, for it encompasses the activity of "Commercial editors, literary agents and other merchandizers of literary works" 88 as well as that of scholarly editors who limit themselves to readings "already existing in historical documents" (p. 16). But does not a distinction need to be made between those who improve a work according to their own aesthetic judgments and those who use aesthetic judgments in the historical task of reconstructing authors' or publishers' intentions? 89 Such shortcomings in Shillingsburg's discussion do not prevent its offering some enlightenment and do not lessen the persuasiveness of its tolerance for differing approaches. 90 It may seem that nothing new has been said by these various writers, and in many ways that is true. The basic issues that confront textual critics and scholarly editors are unchanging, and the attitudes that may be taken toward those issues, though occasionally appearing in altered guises, remain the same. There will be no end to debates over these issues, because they are genuinely debatable; and the process of debate is the way in which each generation of editors thinks through the questions for itself. Some recent editors have claimed that the field is at present in a state of crisis. But the fact that different people hold different opinions about basic issues is not a sign of crisis; it points to the perennial situation in any challenging and lively field. The repeated advocacy of particular viewpoints is not wasteful, except when the advocates do not mend the internal flaws of their predecessors' arguments. Advocates of differing positions need not give up their positions if sound arguments can be made for them; but we do have reason to be discouraged when the arguments continue to suffer from the same defects. There is a prima facie case for the legitimacy of more than one approach to the editorial treatment of historical evidence: editors can produce diplomatic or facsimile editions of individual documentary texts; or they can through emendation create new texts that attempt to be historically faithful either to authors' or to publishers' intentions at particular times. Acceptance of this multiplicity does not, and should not, end debate, for one still has to decide which approach is to be followed in a given situation, and many factors bearing on that decision can usefully be discussed. But the debate thereby moves to a different, and more productive, level. Advocacy of one position then occurs in the context of valid alternative positions; and criticism leveled at a given argument springs not from a belief that only one approach is correct but from the detection of logical flaws in the argument. Enlightened editors who understand this point have always existed; but there is also room, in the field of editing as in any other, for the further spread of enlightenment. Recent writings on editorial theory, like those in times past, provide the basis both for exasperation and for hope. If the acceptance of multiple approaches, as well as the insistence on rigorous argument in support of each, can become more widespread, the quality of the debate will improve, even as the points debated remain (as they must) the same. The recognition that all approaches to the past are partial and complementary helps one to appreciate the full complexity of the issues editors struggle with. Viewed in this way, scholarly editing appears, with more justice than ever, as one of the most demanding and rewarding forms of the critical study of history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "Toward a New History in Literary Study," Profession 84 (1984), pp. 16-23. 2 Lindenberger lacks precision in making this point. His complete sentence is, "Given the suspicion we have developed in recent years toward authorial authority, even an author's authorized text need have no more authority than we choose to give it." However, it is not necessary to question the authority of authors over their texts in order to be wary of "authorized texts," which for many reasons may not fully reflect their authors' intentions. The long tradition of critical editing has involved questioning authorized texts but not normally doubting the authority of authors. 3 The previous two brought the story from the time of W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text" ( SB , 3 [1950-51], 19-36) to the late 1970s: "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," Studies in Bibliography , 28 (1975), 167-229 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 245-307); and "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," SB , 34 (1981), 23-65. As in those pieces, I am again concentrating on general theoretical discussions and normally exclude essays on textual problems in particular authors' works and reviews of individual editions. During the period under review several useful checklists appeared that do include such material: T. H. Howard-Hill, British Bibliography and Textual Criticism: A Bibliography (2 vols., 1979, continuing the series that also contains Shakespearian Bibliography and Textual Criticism: A Bibliography [1971]); Ross W. Beales, Jr., "Documentary Editing: A Bibliography," Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing , 2, no. 4 (December 1980), 10-16; Laurel N. Braswell, Western Manuscripts from Classical Antiquity to the Renaissance: A Handbook (1981); and David Madden and Richard Powers, Writers' Revisions: An Annotated Bibliography of Articles and Books about Writers' Revisions and Their Comments on the Creative Process (1981). There were also several anthologies of essays on editorial matters (other than those mentioned later in this essay), such as N. John Hall's collection on editing the Victorians (volume 9 of Browning Institute Studies , 1981) and recent volumes in the Toronto Editorial Conference series: e.g., William Blissett (ed.), Editing Illustrated Books (1980); A. H. de Quehen (ed.), Editing Poetry from Spenser to Dryden (1981); Trevor H. Levere (ed.), Editing Texts in the History of Science and Medicine (1982). Also during this period Donald H. Reiman published two perceptive accounts of editorial history: "The Four Ages of Editing and the English Romantics," Text 1 (1981), 231-255; and "Romantic Bards and Historical Editors," Studies in Romanticism , 21 (1982), 477-496. And two general introductory treatments of textual and editorial scholarship came out in Modern Language Association publications: my essay on "Textual Scholarship" in Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. Joseph Gibaldi (1981), pp. 29-52; and William Proctor Williams and Craig S. Abbott's chapter on "Textual Criticism" in An Introduction to Bibliographical and Textual Studies (1985), pp. 52-90. 4 A "documentary text" can of course be the text of either a manuscript or a printed item: in either case the text is documentary in that it is what has been preserved in the historical record. 5 Editors of literary works are historians, too; but for convenience I use "historians" to refer to editors of the documentary texts largely used by students of history. 6 I do not mean to suggest that all historical editors think alike: I am aware that there are many who do understand what the literary editors have been discussing in recent years. But the most vocal historical editors, and those who publish their views, have not generally come from this group. An exception is John Y. Simon, who showed his open-mindedness in his ADE Presidential address, "Editors and Critics," Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing , 3, no. 4 (December 1981), 1-4. Jon Kukla, in his review of the Kansas conference volume (see below), recognized the irony that "as the so-called literary editors push for more thoughtful handling of textual evidence, they are forcing all scholars to confront the fundamentals of historical method" ( Newsletter , 4, no. 1 [February 1982], 5-7). 7 Other lines, within the field of literary studies, need to be opened as well: see Conor Fahy, "The View from Another Planet: Textual Bibliography and the Editing of Sixteenth-Century Italian Texts," Italian Studies , 34 (1979), 71-92. On the need for interdisciplinary discussion, see also my comments in Text , 1 (1981), 1-9. 8 This shorthand use of "literary" encompasses works in other genres as well. Much of the recent scholarly editing of philosophical works, for example, is in the tradition of "literary" editing. See Fredson Bowers, "Editing a Philosopher: The Works of William James," Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , 4 (1980), 3-36. 9 Recent discussions of letters include J. A. Dainard (ed.), Editing Correspondence (1979); Robert Stephen Becker, "Challenges in Editing Modern Literary Correspondence," Text , 1 (1981), 257-270; A. R. Braunmuller, "Editing Elizabethan Letters," Text , 1 (1981), 185-199; Norman Fruman, "Some Principles of Epistolary Interpretation," Centrum , n.s., 1 (1981), 75-94; and Ernest W. Sullivan II, "The Problem of Text in Familiar Letters," PBSA , 75 (1981), 115-126. 10 He begins by saying that the literary editor "usually works with materials quite different from those with which the historical editor works, for the latter is interested in manuscripts" (p. 23). Literary editors do frequently deal with works that have been printed; but, if manuscripts survive, these editors not only are "interested" in them but often make them the basis for a new edition. Not realizing this fact, Rogers proceeds to assert, "Literary editors now agree that the first printed version has the best claim to be the copy-text." There is no hint here of the extensive debate, then and now, over this point, and no suggestion that individual situations might affect the choice of copy-text. Literary editors, he claims, make "no attempt to present a facsimile version" (in fact, of course, they often do). instead preferring critical editions, in which "the editors take liberties with the copy-text in order to obtain what the editors consider a text closer to the authorial intention" (p. 24)— a statement that would have been fair enough if the process of emendation had not been misunderstood and trivialized as "taking liberties." In the collation of texts that provides some of the evidence for emendation, we are told, substantives "receive more attention than accidentals" (the naivete of expressing this view without further elaboration clearly goes unrecognized). "In this scheme of editing," Rogers adds, "there tend to be no silent changes" —as if the mechanical reporting of emendations is a part of a theory of editing. There is no point continuing this recital: nearly every statement he makes about the work of literary editors is incorrect or seriously askew. Similar misunderstandings crop up elsewhere in the conference volume: in one of the two introductions, George L. Vogt says, "Most historical editors probably still balk at the literary editors' idea of a completely 'recoverable' text, with all the back-of-the-book baggage that that implies" (pp. 4-5); but no one would claim that every feature of a manuscript text can be recovered from any edition, and the most detailed transcription imaginable need not have any appended apparatus, either at the back of a volume or at the foot of a page. 11 In a review of the conference volume in the Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (7 [1983], 188-190), Harold Love agrees that the faithful reproduction of manuscript texts is desirable but adds that "the overriding considerations must always be the kind of use such documents are to be put to by historians"; it is hard to believe, however, that any serious use of the texts of documents is well served by the elimination of evidence that could play a role in their interpretation. Gordon S. Wood has concisely said, "For historians, convenience of use apparently overrides their concern for literal accuracy" (p. 875 in "Historians and Documentary Editing," Journal of American History , 67 [1980-81], 871-877). 12 I am not in any sense denigrating annotation, which is one of the kinds of commentary that an edition should set in motion (whether within the covers of the edition or elsewhere). Textual and other kinds of historical annotation are not, in any case, easily separable entities, since textual questions cannot be handled sensitively apart from the historical context. 13 Rogers, as a historian, is surely going out of his way to be hostile when he claims not to understand that the value of research is not determined by how dramatic the results are: he asks (irrelevantly, but with an implied answer that is incorrect), "Have the editors of nineteenth-century texts come up with any earth-shaking discoveries?" (p 25). 14 "Editorial Practices—An Historian's View," Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing , 3, no. 1 (February 1981), 4-8. The counterargument was provided by Don L. Cook, in "The Short Happy Thesis of G. Thomas Tanselle," pp. 1-4 (the reference being to my piece on "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 [1978], 1-56—reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 451-506). 15 It is no defense of editorial interference to take the line (implied by Taylor on p. 5) that such alterations do not affect the meaning. As I have previously pointed out ( SB , 34 [1981], 58), why then go to the trouble of making the changes at all? 16 Literary historians will be surprised to hear that "No one feels the need to study the poems of mediocre poets or to run through their letters, unless they made better friends than they did poems" (p. 6). A number of historians have made statements similar to Rogers's and Taylor's. Fredrika J. Teute, in "Views in Review: A Historiographical Perspective on Historical Editing," American Archivist , 43 (1980), 43-56, says that "the historical editor treats the document as a fact. While perhaps slighting the nuances which literary editors appreciate, he does not produce bowdlerized versions claiming to represent the author's true, though unexpressed, intent" (p. 49). And Nathan Reingold, in "Reflections of an Unrepentant Editor," American Archivist , 46 (1983), 14-21, states that "the literary editors have a sense of the sacredness of the words they process. The historical editors, even those imbued with origins and essences, have a belief in the importance of the purport of the words" (p. 18). In the first number of the Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing (March 1979), William B. Willcox had referred to the "high priests of ipsissima verba , who bemoan our textual impurities" (p. 5). 17 "The 'Authentic' Witness: The Editor Speaks for the Document," Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing , 4, no. 1 (February 1982), 8-9. Cutler's piece was written in reply to David J. Nordloh's 1979 conference paper, "The 'Perfect' Text: The Editor Speaks for the Author," printed in the Newsletter , 2, no. 2 (May 1980), 1-3. 18 "The Editor and the Question of Value: Proposal," Text , 1 (1981), 41-43. Although the paper she actually delivered at the conference was different from the one foreshadowed by this proposal, the proposal is printed in Text because Fredson Bowers based his commentary for the conference ("The Editor and the Question of Value: Another View," pp. 45-73) on it. 19 Bowers properly objects to the solecism "textual editor" and points out that a "documentary editor" must also be concerned with texts (e.g., p. 50). 20 Or, as he puts the point more explicitly, alterations occurring within the text of a document "are as much an integral part of the document as the final form of its inscription" (p. 49). By neglecting such alterations, and variants between separate drafts, historians have not learned as much as they might have from "the writer's veerings of thought" and "changes of mind" (p. 48). 21 "On Native Ground: From the History of Printing to the History of the Book," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 93 (1983), 313-336 (and reprinted as a pamphlet, 1984). I have made some further comments on Hall's views in "The Bibliography and Textual Study of American Books," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 95 (1985), 291-329. Hall once described Charles Francis Adams's 1894 "literal reproduction of the texts" of some antinomian documents and then observed, "Scholarship no longer rests upon such antiquarian exactness" ( The Antinomian Controversy, 1636-1638: A Documentary History [1968], p. 21). 22 He states that American printers and readers of the past "were quite indifferent" to the question of authorial intention. But that observation, however true it may be, has no bearing on our legitimate interest in discovering what a particular author meant to say at a given time in the past. 23 Though of course present reactions are only the latest stage in the history of the reception of various texts of a work. 24 I have tried to set forth this point in my Hanes Lecture, The History of Books as a Field Study (1981)—also printed in the Times Literary Supplement , 5 June 1981, pp. 647-649. 25 As much as possible, that is, within the limits imposed by typography and photography. Some evidence, of course, cannot be reproduced. 26 Stephen E. Wiberly, Jr., in discussing the interesting question of the editing of maps does recognize critical editions; indeed, he asserts—without qualification—that "edited maps are superior to facsimiles" (p. 509). But although he refers to the debates over the editing of verbal historical documents, he seems not to have grasped some of the issues involved in them. It does not seem promising, for example, to distinguish maps from personal papers on the grounds that "a map purports to tell us something about a reality outside the mind of its creators" and to conclude that it is therefore "logical to correct the contents of old maps" but "not logical to change the contents of personal papers" (p. 502). What he advocates is to "take an old map, accept some of its data without reservation, verify and correct other of its data, and then include both types of data in the edited map" (pp. 501-502). See "Editing Maps: A Method for Historical Cartography," Journal of Interdisciplinary History , 10 (1980), 499-510. 27 Whether variant readings and emendations are noted within the body of an edited text or in appended lists is a mechanical matter—not unimportant, but certainly not of the same order as the considerations just mentioned. 28 Bowers says of documentary texts: "Students of history may read these texts to gain a firsthand acquaintance with the undigested material, but at higher reaches these documents provide professional scholars with the necessary data from which formal eclectic interpretation can be made in written histories and biographies" (p. 46). The essential role of subjective judgment in the historical enterprise of reconstructing past texts out of the documentary texts that happen to have survived is affirmed (with somewhat different emphases) by two recent essays on the textual study of early manuscripts: my attempt to show that recension is no less conjectural than "conjectural emendation," in "Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," SB , 36 (1983), 21-68; and Lee Patterson's demonstration that the standard dichotomy between external and internal evidence does not coincide with the distinction between objective facts and interpretations, in "The Logic of Textual Criticism and the Way of Genius," in Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. Jerome J. McGann (1985), pp. 55-91. (For a more traditional summary of some of the flaws in the stemmatic approach, see Paul Oskar Kristeller, "The Lachmann Method: Merits and Limitations," Text , 1 [1981], 11-20.) 29 Buch und Buchhandel in Europa im achtzehnten Jahrhundert , ed. Giles Barber and Bernhard Fabian (1981), pp. 81-125. McKenzie's paper, as he states, "extends the argument" of the third of his unpublished Sandars Lectures for 1975-76 ("The London Book Trade in the Later Seventeenth Century"). 30 James McLaverty, who acknowledges the influence of McKenzie, has also found the early eighteenth century to be the time "when authors first became conscious of the anomalous nature of literature and of the importance of printing" (p. 95). He examines the Dunciad Variorum as Pope's "exploitation of the medium" of the scholarly edition, as "an imitation not of spoken discourse but of written discourse" (p. 96). Like McKenzie, he argues that the visual presentation of a text "can carry special associations, and that a richer understanding of the relation of author, book trade, and public may lead to better interpretation of literary works" (p. 105). See "The Mode of Existence of Literary Works of Art: The Case of the Dunciad Variorum ," SB , 37 (1984), 82-105. Another writer who is concerned with the effect of typographic layout, especially lineation, on the "reader experiencing the play in the 'theater of the mind'" (p. 69) is Paul Bertram, in White Spaces in Shakespeare (1981). 31 Analytical bibliographers, of course, have used physical evidence in an attempt to uncover facts about the printing history of individual editions (and this activity can be regarded as one kind of "reading"—see Ross Atkinson, "An Application of Semiotics to the Definition of Bibliography," SB , 33 [1980], 54-73). But the concern here is with the way in which the physical characteristics of a book play a role in the reader's reaction to the piece of writing contained in it. 32 Scholars should, after all, be aware of the shifting conventions in the use of particular formats and page layouts. 33 It is implicit in his reference to decisions that authors and booksellers "take, or impose on one another" (p. 103), but the point is not developed. 34 The word "best" is troubling here and recalls his earlier statement, "Every variant must of course be scrutinized for what it adds or loses in vitality of character and acuity of language" (p. 108). One has to wonder whether this way of stating the matter sufficiently distinguishes editors' own preferences from their judgments regarding what authors preferred. 35 McKenzie does not acknowledge this point when he refers to "an historic and contextual accuracy in the recovery of every possible element of meaning as intended by the author and perceived by an intelligent and sensitive reader of his time" (p. 92). 36 Though it may seem that he is at other times, as when he speaks of "the most important one [concern] of all—what, exactly, an author in his own age did say to his readers and how he and his printers directed them to respond" (p. 123). What the author did say and what the author wanted to say are not always the same. 37 McKenzie devotes the first section (pp. 83-92) of his paper, rather irrelevantly, to a critique of Greg and three commentators on him (Morse Peckham, Hans Zeller, and Tom Davis). The ostensible relevance is that Greg dealt with the drama of a period in which typographical care was not bestowed on printed plays; and the argument is that recent editorial theory, greatly influenced by Greg, is therefore not equipped to handle situations in which text and presentation are integrated. McKenzie gets off the track in emphasizing the distinction between substantives and accidentals and treating it as a distinction between meaningful and formal elements, which (at least in its use by Greg's followers) "has been utterly divisive, shattering any concept of the integrity of the book as an organic form, a material statement in which all its elements participate" (p. 84). Although he is right to find the criticisms of Peckham, Zeller, and Davis deficient, his own analysis fails to recognize that the distinction between substantives and accidentals is actually based not on meaning but on a generalization about human behavior in the past, that it comes into play only when one has no other means of reaching a textual decision, and that accidentals are in fact treated as extremely important elements in texts. There is nothing in Greg's approach, even as extended and followed by others, that prevents one from regarding typography as a textual matter or from preserving the integrity of particular texts (late or early), if one believes the typography or integrity to have resulted from authorial intention; Greg's rationale is no more divisive than any other plan for critical editing, because it recommends eclecticism only when a unity of elements does not exist and only to bring about greater unity. It perfectly well accommodates McKenzie's demands for a textual theory, and there is thus some irony in his charge that the tradition deriving from Greg suffers from "intellectual timidity" (p. 92). 38 "The Sociology of a Text: Orality, Literacy and Print in Early New Zealand," Library , 6th ser., 6 (1984), 333-365. Another sensitive treatment of oral texts—of "the pleasures and advantages of preliteracy"—is John Miles Foley's "Editing Oral Epic Texts: Theory and Practice," Text , 1 (1981), 75-94. 39 Indeed, it moves outside books and for him becomes a pattern in life. There is, he believes, "a principle of textual criticism operative in the real world which implies the concept of an ideal text that the versions have failed fully to express": "The physical versions and their fortuitous forms are not the only testimonies to intent: implicit in the accidents of history is an ideal text which history has begun to discover, a reconciliation of readings which is also a meeting of minds. The concept of an ideal text as a cultural and political imperative is not imposed on history but derives from it and from an understanding of the dynamics of bibliography as a study of the meanings 'books' make" (p. 364). 40 Another writer who has stressed the importance of original typography is Randall McLeod, but his point is different from McKenzie's. His concern is not primarily with the way typographic layout carries historical meaning or with the possibility that it is an integral part of a literary work; rather, he has shown in a series of articles how typographic evidence can be essential in making textual decisions (as when a particular spelling was caused by the necessity of inserting a type between two kerned types that would not fit together) and how scholarly editions that fail to report such evidence deprive readers of information they need for evaluating editorial judgments. Unmodernized (or "old-spelling") scholarly editions, in other words, do not go far enough toward providing historical evidence, for they separate spelling and punctuation from typography. Facsimile editions are desirable, in this view, not specifically because the original typography is part of the text or is what emerged from the original process of publication but because they make available to readers the evidence present in the original typography (that is, all of it that is reproducible). Whereas McKenzie is concerned with determining what details constitute a literary work, McLeod is talking about the presentation of evidence. If we are to have critical editions at all, we must resign ourselves to the fact that their apparatuses will not contain every piece of evidence used by their editors; but we have a right to expect that editors will recognize, take into account, and comment on the kind of evidence McLeod discusses, and his articles are valuable in calling attention to uses of typographic evidence often neglected. His criticism of the practices of some editors is well taken, but it does not in fact invalidate the concept of critical editions in modern typography. See his "Spellbound: Typography and the Concept of Old-Spelling Editions," Renaissance and Reformation , n.s., 3 (1979), 50-65; "Editing Shak-speare," Sub-Stance , no. 33/34 (1982), 26-55; and " Gon. No more, the text is foolish.", in The Division of the Kingdoms (see note 68 below), pp. 153-193. 41 He had earlier expressed some of the same ideas in essays, as in "The Text, the Poem, and the Problem of Historical Method," New Literary History , 12 (1980-81), 269-288, where he says that "every work of art is the product of an interaction between an artist, on the one hand, and a variety of social determinants on the other" (p. 275). In two other papers presented at textual conferences in 1981 and 1982 (but not published until after his book) he explores the "social nexus" of literary works and the relations between "historicist textual criticism" and literary criticism: "Shall These Bones Live?", Text , 1 (1981 [published in 1984]), 21-40; and "The Monks and the Giants: Textual and Bibliographical Studies and the Interpretation of Literary Works," in Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. McGann (1985), pp. 180-199. The latter piece presents a useful (if rather melodramatic) statement of the role of textual criticism in literary study, depicting textual criticism as a broad field of historical scholarship, in which the production of editions is only one of many agenda (a view I agree with, though McGann believes I do not). 42 It is not, however. But the fact that his criticism of this school of editing is often superficial or incorrect is a secondary point; the more fundamental matter to be examined is his general attack on an author-based approach to editing (whether or not he has the details of the Bowers line right). I shall simply note here three of the deficiencies in his treatment of the Bowers position. The most serious flaw is his failure to acknowledge its flexibility, for it does not demand that a manuscript be used as copy-text in preference to a first edition, or a first in preference to a later edition, when the circumstances suggest otherwise, and it is capable of handling the examples he cites. A prime instance of this flexibility is Bowers's own practice in his William James edition and his own theoretical statement in "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited," SB , 31 (1978), 90-161—an essay cited once by McGann but not really used in his analysis. It is thus incorrect to state flatly, without qualification, that "the Bowers position is that the author's manuscript is a higher authority" than the first edition (p. 55). McGann also stresses the word "final" in "final intention" in an extremely literal way that I think the editors following Greg have not normally done; in practice the term has excluded the intentions reflected in unfinished drafts but it has not been taken to rule out the possibility of different intentions manifested in different completed versions. And several times he speaks of "the rule of final intentions" governing "the choice of copy-text" (as on p. 55), without recognizing that an early copy-text chosen for its accidentals may be very far indeed from the author's "final intentions" with respect to substantives. 43 McGann's unwillingness to accept this point underlies his belief that the Bowers system, based on a classical model (derived, via Greg, from Lachmann), is inappropriate for dealing with modern materials: because the textual critic of modern works "actually possesses the 'lost originals' which the classical critic is forced to hypothesize, his concept of an ideal text reveals itself to be—paradoxically—a pure abstraction, whereas the classical critic's ideal text remains, if 'lost,' historically actual" (p. 57). The force of this observation as a criticism is not clear, for a "pure abstraction" can be a valid goal; and textual critics of classical works (or works of any other period) have the option of attempting to construct texts reflecting their authors' intentions, as well as attempting to recreate lost documents. The concept of "final intention" is not merely a device to help guide editors of modern materials through "the mass of documentary evidence" that often confronts them (p. 56); it leads to a goal worth working toward, regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the surviving documents, a goal that is historical whether or not the text being sought ever existed in written form. (Cf. McKenzie's point in note 39 above.) 44 Even to summarize McGann's position, as McGann himself does, in terms of an author and publisher working together to put something before the public does not, one would think, catch the spirit of McGann's argument, if what is implied here is that they necessarily worked together harmoniously and cooperatively. To think of the production of literature as a social or collaborative process is, one supposes, only to say that a number of people are involved and that any of them may influence the published text—not that they are never in conflict with one another. 45 He says that instances of the kind under discussion "go to the issue of textual versions rather than to the rationale of copy-text," but he is in fact talking about the choice of copy-text, and his summarizing paragraph speaks of "the decision on copy-text." At another point he distinguishes, without explanation, between "copy-text" and "version of a text we choose to work from" (p. 56). 46 They are thus not the product of historical scholarship, in the usual sense that it attempts to reconstruct past events. Of course any activity in the present is historical in the sense that it in some degree reflects its own time (as I shall note further below). 47 Another example of the attempt to mix these approaches is Donald Pizer's "Self-Censorship and Textual Editing," in Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. McGann (1985), pp. 144-161. Pizer's four "'tests' for accepting the belief that self-censorship has occurred and that restoration of an earlier state of the text is required" are: evaluating evidence regarding the composition and publication history of a work, evaluating evidence bearing on the author's motives in making revisions, deciding through critical analysis whether one version is "better" than others, and considering whether "the first published version of a major work" is "a historical artifact that should continue to occupy the role of general reading text even if it has been subject to self-censorship" (pp. 150-151). The latter two are not in fact relevant to "accepting the belief that self-censorship has occurred"; they do represent two possible approaches to making textual decisions, but neither can be combined with the first two to provide a coherent rationale for choosing a single text. Pizer recognizes the value of publishing editions of alternative texts, but he still thinks ultimately in terms of a single text that he would like to see "generally read" (p. 155). (In itself, his account of "the interaction between self and world, which is inseparable from the expressive process" [p. 154], and of the "historical resonance" [p. 156] of long-established texts, is well stated.) 48 The "set of interconnected guidelines" he refers to at one point (p. 107) is not the same thing: it consists of considerations to be taken into account in choosing a copy-text, considerations that include "the character of the audience of the edition," "the early printing history" of the work, and "the current state of textual criticism" (p. 106). 49 He seems to think that he has opened up a wider range of options and thereby increased the area in which subjectivity can operate, but editors have always faced the same options, for there have always been valid alternatives to critical texts reflecting authorial intention (which in themselves present many alternatives). 50 The opening sentence of his chapter on modernizing betrays some confusion in terminology, if nothing else. He says that a "sharp distinction" is usually made "between the scholarly or critical edition on the one hand, and modernized or noncritical editions on the other" (p. 95). Generally the term "critical edition" is used to mean an edition containing a critical text, which is a text that does not agree precisely with a single documentary source because it incorporates alterations reflecting the editor's critical judgment (exercised to make the text more nearly conform with some desired goal). Thus an edition can be scholarly without being critical, and all modernized editions contain critical texts. Of course one can define these terms anew if one wishes, but it seems inappropriate to associate the word "noncritical," which already seems to refer to the absence of critical judgment, as in a facsimile, with "modernized," which involves a great deal of judgment and refers to editions that are at the opposite extreme from facsimiles. 51 McGann continually refers in this discussion to "nonspecialist editions," by which he means "nonspecialist texts," for he is referring to the adjustment of the text, not just the apparatus, for different classes of readers. 52 Arguments for modernizing are always doomed to failure, just as the practice of modernizing is bound to be inconsistent. Yet defenses of it continue to appear. Stanley Wells, in Modernizing Shakespeare's Spelling (1979), believes that modernizing "removes unnecessary barriers to understanding, making it possible for the reader to concentrate on the text itself, undistracted by obsolete and archaic accidentals of presentation" (p. vi). This view of "the text itself" links Wells with generations of compositors and publishers' editors that preceded him in feeling free to alter spelling and punctuation but less free to alter words (the behavior Greg described in his "Rationale"). But after going through Wells's discussion of the problems with which modernizing is fraught, readers are likely to be convinced that the real barrier between them and the text is being erected by the modernizer. Wells ends by explaining that modernizing editors have to give "hard thought" to the meaning of each word, and their choice of a form in each case "communicates the results of such thought." Modernization, he concludes, "may thus be seen not, as some would have it, as a work of popularization, even of vulgarization, but as a means of exploring Shakespeare's text that can make a real contribution to scholarship" (p. 34). It is difficult to see how the case for modernization is strengthened by saying that it forces editors to think hard about every word, for responsible editors of unmodernized critical editions must do the same thing. Editors who modernize, Wells says, "may be surprised to find how much that is of interest in Shakespeare's language has gone unnoticed." But modernizing seems too high a price to pay for a promise that editors have done the work we expect them to do anyway. (Other unconvincing arguments for modernizing have recently come from R. M. Flores in "The Need for a Scholarly, Modernized Edition of Cervantes' Work," Cervantes , 2 [1982], 69-87.) 53 In "Shall These Bones Live?" (see note 41 above), McGann has shown how powerfully he can write about the role of history in literary understanding. I believe that what I have suggested here regarding the validity of two fundamentally opposed emphases in textual criticism is analogous to his acceptance of the necessity for two approaches to literature ("two classes of men [scholars and critics] are always upon the earth of humane letters, and whoever seeks to reconcile them seeks to destroy the existence of their shared world" [p. 25])—and indeed seems to me more in the spirit of his comments than his own Critique is. But he also notes that a productive symbiosis, rather than a sterile co-existence, requires constant prodding from each side. His Critique —and, I hope, my remarks here—can be seen as part of this constructive process. 54 Some parts of the book had been published earlier, as in (among other places) "The Determinacy of the Creative Process and the 'Authority' of the Author's Textual Decisions," College Literature , 10 (1983), 99-125. 55 Thus "some perfectly real aesthetic frissons" are "spurious" (p. 11). 56 His criticism of Greg, the Center for Editions of American Authors, and Bowers is often unfair, so much so that it is self-defeating: for example, he speaks of editors who were moved "to stake their reputations on the validity of the rationale of copy-text set forth by W. W. Greg" (p. 59), as if reputations were the dominant concern; he says that "no editorial formula, even one as appealing as Greg's, can substitute for the expertise which comes only from years of conscientious (and preferably loving) biographical and critical study of the author whom one presumes to edit" (p. 67), as if editors who follow Greg substitute a formula for knowledge; he complains about certain critical judgments by CEAA editors "with well-nigh limitless federal funds" (p. 82), as if the magnitude of funds (which he knows he is exaggerating) were relevant to this issue; and he refers to the "hubris of the Newest Bibliography which at its worst barricaded editing within a mad-scientist laboratory more isolated from the author than any critic or theorist had yet been" (p. 240). 57 Of course one cannot limit the discussion exclusively to whole works, because the process of original composition may be spread out over a long period, or may be interrupted, with the result that the earlier and the later parts of a work may be the products of separate bursts of creative activity and may conflict with each other in various ways. (John McClelland, in "Critical Editing in the Modern Languages," Text , 1 [1981], 201-216, takes a position somewhat akin to Parker's in advocating as copy-text a text representing the point "where the work has acquired its definitive structure, either as the result of the accumulation of variants or by a dramatic revision" [p. 206], for "we are probably being more faithful to the text itself by presenting it in the state at which it was receiving the author's closest attention," since "extensive revision requires as much concentration as does composition" [p. 207]. McClelland, however, is more optimistic than Parker about the possibility of coherent later revision and thus would approve later copy-texts more readily than Parker. In a dubious argument, McClelland also claims that the variants would be "easier to handle" if the copy-text were "the text that will actually be read" [p. 204].) 58 Thus it is no objection to his line of reasoning to say that in rejecting late revisions the editor may not see what the author was getting at. Undoubtedly it does happen that editors find revisions thoughtless or damaging because they fail to follow an author's changed, and perhaps unconventional, mode of expression. But all critical editors take the risk of misunderstanding the authors they hope to serve well. (And they are not to be blamed—as Parker suggests on p. 12 and elsewhere—for trying to make sense of the texts they encounter: literature can be hard to make sense of.) 59 See G. T. Tanselle, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," SB , 29 (1976), 167-211; reprinted in Selected Studies , pp. 309-353. 60 An interest in such last intentions does not of course mean that there is no legitimate historical interest in earlier stages of a work. 61 He also attacks—a different matter—"the superstition that the author is infallible" (p. 51). Whether very many people have ever taken the position that the author could make no mistakes in revision is a real question, but is beside the point here. (Parker does understand that a "maimed text" can still retain power: see p. 8.) 62 Such as "Evidences for 'Late Insertions' in Melville's Works," Studies in the Novel , 7 (1975), 407-424; "Aesthetic Implications of Authorial Excisions: Examples from Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Stephen Crane," in Editing Nineteenth-Century Fiction , ed. Jane Millgate (1978), pp. 99-119; and three articles by him and Brian Higgins: "Sober Second Thoughts: Fitzgerald's 'Final Version' of Tender is the Night ," Proof , 4 (1975), 129-152; "Maggie's 'Last Night': Authorial Design and Editorial Patching," Studies in the Novel , 10 (1978), 64-75; "The Flawed Grandeur of Melville's Pierre ," in New Perspectives on Melville , ed. Faith Pullin (1978), pp. 162-196. 63 See "The 'New Scholarship': Textual Evidence and Its Implications for Criticism, Literary Theory, and Aesthetics," Studies in American Fiction , 9 (1981), 181-197; and Brian Higgins and Parker, "The Chaotic Legacy of the New Criticism and the Fair Augury of the New Scholarship," in Ruined Eden of the Present , ed. G. R. Thompson and Virgil L. Lokke (1981), pp. 27-45. 64 Parker is not receptive to reader-response criticism: see, for example, pp. 219-220. 65 He admits that this discussion "will temporarily submerge the issue of reader response" (p. 94), but he believes that reader-response theory can finally contribute to the concept of authorial intention. Not surprisingly, he characterizes the kind of intention editors are primarily concerned with as "operative intentions," encompassing not only "the actions that the author, as he writes the text, understands himself to be performing in the text" (or "active intentions") but also "the immediate effects he understands these actions will achieve in his projected reader" (p. 99). (He unnecessarily elaborates his set of definitions by introducing "inferred intention" to "characterize the critic's description" of what the author is aiming to achieve, even though he recognizes that "operative intentions" are also necessarily inferred. "I am trying," he says, "to emphasize the inferential process an editor uses to posit a specific authorial intention." Surely this process need not be called an "intention" or brought into the definition of authorial intention at all. Mailloux's confusion is shown by his illustration of how the term is useful: it allows him, he says, "to talk about the operative intention an author claimed he had and a perhaps differing inferred intention an editor arrives at after evaluating all the relevant evidence." But the first of these is simply an author's "stated intention," which editors are always wary of, and the latter is the "operative intention" that the editor infers on the basis of all evidence, including the author's claims.) The upshot of his discussion hardly seems a revelation, because editors have regularly been able to understand, without being schooled by reader-response theorists, that authors use language conventions and therefore have expected their readers to react in certain ways to certain locutions. Explicitly defining the concept of authorial intention so as to include the "immediate effects" to be produced in the reader during the reading process is, perhaps, unobjectionable, but it is also unnecessary; it represents no shift in what has always been meant by the concept of the author's intention to convey a meaning through writing down particular words and punctuation. (Why a concept of authorial intention should imply a "specific rationale for critical interpretation"—a point made several times, as on pp. 108, 110, 112, 113—is puzzling.) 66 Or, perhaps more straightforwardly: "it is possible to reject some authorial revisions because they deface the text after it was finished" (p. 112). 67 Certainly those editors responsible for the wording of the CEAA emblem ("An Approved Text," not "The Approved Text") felt this way; but this gesture has not been taken as seriously as it deserves to be. Tom Davis, in a thoughtful review of the Lawrence and Hardy editions ("Textual Criticism: Philosophy and Practice," Library , 6th ser., 6 [1984], 386-397)—which begins with promise and descends to anticlimax—describes two models of "a text and its history": one emphasizes growing deterioration and corruption, the other a positive process of collaboration. Both, he says, are "equally 'true'" (p. 389). 68 As Randall McLeod puts it, "our tradition is unwilling to allow multiple textual authorities to rest as a simultaneous set of existential entities to be encountered absurdly by the reader" (p. 422 of "The Marriage of Good and Bad Quartos," Shakespeare Quarterly , 33 [1982], 421-431). He goes on to speak of "the infinitive text, which we may define as a polymorphous set of all versions, some part of each of which has a claim to substantive status." The recent controversy over the text of King Lear calls attention to the perennial competition between the attractions of a single text and the messier possibilities of independent versions. Although those who believe that the Lear variants provide evidence of Shakespeare's revision have overdramatized their case, there is no doubt that the possibility of authorial revision must always be in the editor's mind in evaluating variant readings. See Steven Urkowitz, Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear" (1980); Gary Taylor and Michael Warren (eds.), The Division of the Kingdoms: Shakespeare's Two Versions of "King Lear" (1983); and Ernest A. J. Honigmann, "Shakespeare as a Reviser," in Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. McGann (1985), pp. 1-22. 69 Fredson Bowers has recently summarized his views on apparatus in "Notes on Editorial Apparatus," in Historical &amp; Editorial Studies in Medieval &amp; Early Modern English , for Johan Gerritsen , ed. Mary-Jo Arn and Hanneke Wirtjes, with Hans Jensen (1985), pp. 147-162. (He and Paul Werstine have also had an exchange on historical collations that include readings from posthumous editions: Werstine, "Modern Editions and Historical Collation in Old-Spelling Editions of Shakespeare," Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , 4 [1980], 95-106; Bowers, "The Historical Collation in an Old-Spelling Shakespeare Edition: Another View," SB , 35 [1982], 234-258.) 70 "The Synchrony and Diachrony of Texts: Practice and Theory of the Critical Edition of James Joyce's Ulysses ," Text , 1 (1981), 305-326. As the title makes clear, this paper is intended to provide the rationale for the plan followed in Gabler's edition of Ulysses (1984); but it also includes illustrations from Faulkner and Milton and is meant to be a theoretical statement of wide applicability. 71 At one point, for example, he distinguishes between "the authoritative text free of corruption" and "the critically constituted text of final authorial intention established by bibliographically controlled editorial eclecticism" (pp. 310-311; see also p. 318). 72 A distinction should be made between a "genetic" text and the kind of "synoptic" text that Gabler is recommending. A genetic text aims to show the development of the text or texts present in a single document by providing a running text that indicates cancellations, interlineations, and other alterations. Gabler's synoptic text, on the other hand, aims to bring together in a single running text the authorial readings from all relevant documents. The symbols in the synoptic text, therefore, have to serve two functions: to indicate (as in a genetic text) the status of alterations within documents and also (as the sigla in a list do) to identify the various source documents and show their sequence. Furthermore, the synoptic text contains editorial emendations, for it is concerned only with authorial revisions, not with "corruptions"—which are therefore to be corrected in the synoptic text and recorded "in the type of subsidiary apparatus best suited to the purpose, i.e., an appended lemmatised emendation list" (p. 318). 73 In his edition of Ulysses he calls his "reading text" a "new, critically established text," consisting of "the emended continuous manuscript text at its ultimate level of compositional development" (p. 1903). 74 Issued as Occasional Paper No. 3 by the English Department of the Faculty of Military Studies, Royal Military College, University of New South Wales. A revised version will be published by the University of Georgia Press in 1986. 75 As he states this point elsewhere, "reading a single text of a work of art as if it adequately represented the work or was in fact the work may limit the reader's access to the whole work of art" (p. 71). 76 He does not, however, always give adequate recognition to the fact that critical editing is a form of literary criticism—as when he says that "textual critics tried to provide texts that would deserve the new scrutiny" of the New Critics (p. 7), as if the providing of a text is a pre-critical activity. 77 Shillingsburg forsakes his usual even-handedness here by calling lists that include nonauthorial variants "trivialized"; to the person interested more in the text that emerged from the publishing process than one reflecting authorial intention, these variants are not trivial. 78 Often it is not possible to identify the agent more precisely than "publisher's editor or compositor" or "someone other than the author." 79 Or, as he puts it elsewhere, editors should shift their "emphasis from 'the right text' to 'the whole work'" (p. 42). 80 If there were as little doubt about this kind of intention as Shillingsburg suggests, those editors whose aim is to establish authorial wording would not disagree as often as they do. Since manuscripts, as Shillingsburg recognizes, may contain "scribal error, Freudian slip, or shorthand elision" (p. 27), one must use critical judgment, based on an interpretation of intended meaning, to determine where these flaws occur. 81 Editors who talk about authorial intention do in fact generally mean an intended sequence of words and punctuation, but it is understandable that their discussions often contain references to intended meaning: the one is inextricable from the other. Recognizing this point in no way leads editors away from the active authorial intention they should properly focus on and toward such other levels of intention as "an intention to be brilliant or successful, or to write a novel or poem." But Shillingsburg oversimplifies the issue when he adds to this series: "or to convey an idea or emotion or attitude" (p. 26). Of course he is right to say that "several alternative texts of more or less satisfaction to the author" might convey the same meaning; nevertheless, the intention to convey a particular idea is not irrelevant to the intention to write down a particular sequence of words. Shillingsburg (p. 28)—like Mailloux (pp. 96-97) and Parker (p. 22)—complains that my concept of active intention in my 1976 essay (see note 59 above) does not encompass the author's intention in the process of composition. All I can say is that I meant for it to: when I spoke, for example, of "the intention of the author to have particular words and marks of punctuation constitute his text" (p. 182 [324]), I was assuming that such intention manifests itself continuously throughout the writing of a work (and often shifts, producing revisions—a problem I took up in the later parts of the essay). (I am aware of the irony: this situation illustrates the fact that a writer's statement of intention does not always match what readers find in the work.) Shillingsburg himself, though he emphasizes the composition process, is inclined to think in terms of "stages" (as on p. 24) rather than—more realistically—a continuous process, in which any pronounced points of stability that do exist grow out of numerous subordinate stages. Another writer who defines the intention relevant to editors as what the author "intended to write or what he intended to constitute his text" (p. 127) is James McLaverty, whose article on "The Concept of Authorial Intention in Textual Criticism," Library , 6th ser., 6 (1984), 121-138, is an unusually intelligent, if occasionally mistaken, treatment of the subject. McLaverty believes that every published version of a work reflects a different intention and that an editor must choose one version (not necessarily the "final" one) to edit (p. 130); but he does not understand that the editor can draw emendations from the texts of other versions without necessarily mixing versions, for in many cases the only documentary evidence of corrections in one version is the report of them embedded in the documentary text of the next version (cf. note 85 below). His reluctance to allow such eclecticism springs from a general tendency to wish to restrict the area in which editorial judgment operates. Thus he finds a way to argue against any correction of errors of external fact: an author's intention to be correct, he feels, is outside the scope of the kind of intention (to have a certain sequence of words and punctuation) with which the editor is concerned (p. 129). Critical editors, however, if their approach is to be truly critical, cannot eliminate any part of a text—such as references to external fact—from critical scrutiny, even though there will be no universal agreement as to which factual errors are, and which are not, expressed in words that the author intended to write. (See also my comments on "External Fact as an Editorial Problem," SB , 32 [1979], 1-47; reprinted in Selected Studies , pp. 355-401.) His complaint that no principle has been established for determining which versions of a work are so different as to require separate editions similarly represents a desire for rules that would replace judgments. In another interesting essay on intention, James E. May ("Determining Final Authorial Intention in Revised Satires: The Case of Edward Young," SB , 38 [1985], 276-289) attempts to identify those revisions in satires that "presuppose an audience and state of affairs different from those for which the work was originally intended" (p. 277) and to show that they (unlike the ones "compatible with the work's original conception" [p. 289]) should "be denied final authority," thus "preserving the historicity of the earlier version" (p. 277). Despite the repeated emphasis on "final authority," his work appears to recognize that both the original and the revised versions are of independent value as satiric works. 82 Even a text , which is "the actual order of words and punctuation as contained in any one physical form," is immaterial because the text "can exist simultaneously in the memory, in more than one copy or in more than one form" (p. 38). Shillingsburg's point is correct, if awkwardly stated—for if a single text can exist in more than one form (as it can), then it should not be defined as being "contained in any one physical form." A text is simply one particular sequence of words and punctuation (which may or may not accurately represent a version or a draft). James McLaverty has also recently explored the ontological status of literary works—with more sophistication than Shillingsburg—in "The Mode of Existence of Literary Works of Art" (see note 30 above), an essay that helpfully summarizes the debate over whether printed texts of literary works are scores (notational systems) or instances of the work. In his essay on intention (see note 81 above), he makes use of the idea that the printed text is a score (p. 127). 83 I think he is unwise, here and elsewhere, to contrast literary art with pottery, suggesting that a vase does not undergo revision in the process of its creation. ("There is a pleasing simplicity in the notion that texts grow or develop or are shaped toward a final form—rather like a potter shaping a vase on a wheel. But the analogy is misleading. A book does not come in final shape directly from the artist's hands like a vase" [p. 36]). All created works, however, are subject to revision during their creation. The reason we sometimes have versions and drafts of literary works is that the physical forms in which they are recorded are separate from the work itself, whereas the earlier versions of a vase are necessarily destroyed in the process of shaping the final version. If earlier versions are part of the total work, then in many cases the full work cannot survive, and the extent of what does survive is fortuitous. Some versions of literary works never existed on paper but only in the minds of their creators; and often writers who use word processors destroy all trace of earlier versions or drafts as they create new ones. The total work, inclusive of all versions and drafts, is probably never fully recoverable; but in the case of literary works (and other works of which versions are recorded on paper) there is the chance that some of the documents containing versions and drafts have survived. This point has not been adequately dealt with by those who hold that variants are integral parts of works. 84 As Shillingsburg concisely puts it, "Texts may contain non-authorial parts; versions do not" (p. 39). 85 A single set of revisions, for instance, could be spread over two documents, with the result that the text of neither document would reflect the entirety of a particular version or draft. When Shillingsburg describes an eclectic text as one that "mixes material from two or more versions" (p. 40), one wonders whether he is rejecting the usual definition of "eclectic" as referring to the mixing of material from two or more documentary texts or whether he is equating versions with the (sometimes defective) texts of individual documents. A further hint of this problem occurs in his inaccurate description of the "historical orientation," when he speaks of "points in creation when the text reaches stasis in a document" (p. 61). The stasis conferred by a physical document does not necessarily represent a point of stasis in the development of a work. (I call the description inaccurate because the value of reproducing the text of a document does not depend on whether a "documentary form is a complete record of the work at some stage in its development"; no justification is needed other than the fact that the document survives and is therefore a piece of historical evidence.) In his "Key Issues" article (see note 90 below), Shillingsburg deals more incisively with this matter, making clear that he does indeed wish to define "eclectic" as referring to the mixing of versions, not merely of documentary texts. But in doing so he is moving beyond what scholarly editing normally encompasses and into "creative" or "aesthetic" editing: "Eclecticism," he writes, "does not attempt to conform to a single ascertainable version ever existing at one time even in the author's intention (or conception)" (pp. 7-8). If the term "eclectic" is to be applied to scholarly editing at all, it must refer to the mixing of documentary texts to produce a postulated version. Shillingsburg does recognize in his article that the integrity of a version—being an abstraction—is not tied to an individual documentary text; but that recognition should also have caused him to see that an editor who mixes readings from different texts in an effort to produce a text conforming to the author's intentions at a given time (and not to produce simply what the editor likes better) is not mixing versions but rather is reconstructing one. 86 It is rather puzzlingly called "Forms." The opening of the chapter suggests that forms are "details of presentation" as opposed to "substance" (p. 13). But the subject matter treated is certainly not limited to "accidentals." 87 Shillingsburg admits that "all violations of documentary historical forms (including Bowers' and McGann's) are supported by appeals to one or more competing formal orientation which is seen to take priority over the historical, even if only in some limited way" (p. 15). In that case, if the "orientations" are meant to represent the basic positions that are often mixed in practice, why not define the "historical" approach as simply the diplomatic (or noncritical) reproduction of documentary texts? 88 Despite the fact that Shillingsburg says in his introduction that he is dropping "from further consideration" what he calls "commercial editing and copy-editing" (p. 4). 89 Shillingsburg says that "an editorial concern for the 'best' text is always an appeal to an aesthetic orientation" (p. 16) and at another point refers to "readings from several versions selected on the basis of the editor's aesthetic values in his attempt to present the author's 'best' text" (p. 10). But these statements are not helpful because they do not make clear that the best text for each of various historical purposes requires the editor's aesthetic judgment to be put to the service of deciding what someone in the past would have preferred. 90 Because Shillingsburg's book represents a fuller working out of the ideas he had earlier set forth in "Key Issues in Editorial Theory," Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , 6 (1982), 3-16, it is not necessary here to discuss that generally less satisfactory essay. Some passages in it, however, are clearer than corresponding ones in the book (see note 85 above).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">There is some perplexity from this Place between w t is printed &amp; w t written MS note in Bathurst's second folio edition of Swift's Verses (1739)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The text of Swift's best-known poem generated a substantial bibliography of studies before and after Harold Williams's reconstructed text in The Poems of Jonathan Swift (3 vols., Oxford, 1937: second edition, 1958, II, 551-572), but his reconstruction of the Notes has passed without subsequent comment. 1 After Williams, all serious editions of Swift's poems include his notes at some point, conceding if only tacitly their function as part of Swift's total meaning in the poem; but all hover uncertainly around the questions of their provenance and their status, in marked contrast, of course, to the unproblematical but similarly functioning notes added by Pope to The Dunciad . 2 Williams examined only four examples with manuscript additions (from a still unknown total number), and his reconstruction was therefore appropriately cautious. In the absence of definitive evidence caution is still necessary, for the textual depredations of King and Pope have left a permanent legacy of textual uncertainty. Thus to one note (to 1. 345) Williams attaches the contradictory puzzle common to them all: this note, from a single and unique source as far as Williams was then aware, 'may have come originally from Swift himself' (p. 566). 3 What follows is an attempt to penetrate the screen erected by King, Pope, Faulkner, and to some extent Swift himself, and to provide the textual parameters inside which Williams's reconstruction of the Notes may be further considered in the light of new evidence. Swift 'substantially approved' (Williams's words) Faulkner's 1735-8 edition of his Works , and expressed anger and dismay at the 381-line King-Pope edition of the poem, which cut 165 lines, all of the notes, and added 62 lines from The Life and Genuine Character of Dr. Swift (London, J. Roberts, 1733), for the first folio version published by Bathurst in 1739. We also know that Swift took steps to ensure that Faulkner produced an authentic version of the original poem. There are thus two questions at issue. What is the evidence for Swift's authorship and sanction of those parts of the Notes and additions which have come down to us only in manuscript form and in other than Swift's own handwriting? And secondly, is a minimally uncertain reconstruction of these Notes possible?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I There is a remarkable degree of consensus amongst those surviving copies of Faulkner's 1739 Dublin octavo editions of the Verses which contain manuscript additions. Without being able to prove that Swift himself supplied the Notes, his modern editors assume that the burden of internal evidence leans the other way, i.e. in all likelihood Swift did supply the Notes because one can conceive of no other candidate in Dublin at the time who could have done so. The specific impetus for my discussion is two-fold: Irvin Ehrenpreis's recent comment that 'A careful study of Swift's [ sic ] notes to the Verses would be a valuable work'; 4 and secondly, a previously unknown copy of Faulkner's 1739 Verses containing substantially all other examined manuscript additions plus two unique and pertinent additions, the whole volume carefully matching manuscript notes to the space Faulkner left blank in the printed text. 5 The latter tends to confirm Ehrenpreis's hypothesis that Swift wrote the Verses to be published after he died. This hypothesis is presumably based on Swift's letter to Pope (1 May, 1733: Correspondence , IV, 152) disclaiming all responsibility for The Life and Genuine Character of Dr. Swift , and stating that 'the true one . . . is not proper to be seen till I can be seen no more'. 6 Williams's reconstruction was based on Faulkner's Dublin octavo. He filled in all of Faulkner's blanks, made forty minor emendations of accidentals, corrected Faulkner's mis-prints, and introduced one substantive and well-known error (l. 19: him/me). For this he collated the following: his own copy of the 1739 Dublin Verses with Faulkner's firstedition title page (now in Cambridge University Library and described there and here as Williams 410 1 ); his own copy of the same with a fifthedition title page (previously owned by Dowden, also now in Cambridge and known as Williams 410 2 ); a copy of Faulkner's 1739 Verses completed in Forster's hand (Forster Collection, Victoria and Albert Museum Library, described here as LVA-F); and the Huntington Library copy of Bathurst's second, London, folio edition of the poem (1739), for which I adopt Foxon's designation (as for all additional copies below), S922. 7 All have manuscript additions. Foxon gives five locations for copies of the 1739 Dublin Verses (S926) with manuscript additions. I have compared six copies with Faulkner's first-edition title page and one copy each of the second and fifth Faulkner editions.

      <field name="fulltext">II Faulkner's Dublin edition of 1739 makes two calculated and distinct provisions for the reader's additional manuscript contributions, the precise extent of which, the internal evidence suggests, was already known. First, this overt plea entitled 'The Publisher's Advertisement': The following Poem was printed and published in London, with great Success. We are informed by the supposed Author's Friends, that many Lines and Notes are omitted in the English Edition; therefore we hope, that such Persons who have seen the Original Manuscript, will help us to procure those Omissions, and correct any Things that may be amiss, and the Favour shall be gratefully acknowledged. This paragraph is, in one respect, disingenuous. Faulkner, no less than Swift, knew that the English edition was a mangled version of the original (see King's letter quoted below), and his 1739 text had as its main commercial advantage an exposure of the Bathurst folio. In plainly stating that what follows is still textually incomplete there is also the implication that informed sources knew very well what had been cut out. King and Pope were the initial recipients of the complete text and notes of the Verses ; but they would be unlikely to send back for distribution in Dublin material which they had already deemed unsuitable for printing and circulation in London, thereby exposing their own edition as a textual travesty of the original. Faulkner's appeal, perhaps, was directed primarily at his Dublin readers. 8 To an English readership, the close working relationship between the only reliable source (Swift) and his only authorised publisher (Faulkner) would render this appeal supererogatory. If Swift remained (at least in public) unwilling to provide an authoritative version of the Notes, then Faulkner could only appeal to those in the Dublin circle who possessed manuscript copies. My hypothesis is that in all important respects as to substance and wording of the Notes Faulkner knew exactly what was missing; that he had no unequivocal sanction for publishing them from Swift himself, and therefore provided virtually a do-it-yourself edition in which the most inflammatory of the Notes were toned down by excisions. Agreement among the various transcripts of the manuscript notes suggests a single source, perhaps a copy of the complete and original manuscript quite separate from the manuscript sent to and edited by King and Pope for Bathurst. Faulkner's Advertisement coolly functions if (as the MoU copy indicates in a manuscript note on [A 2 ]) Faulkner was simply carrying out Swift's original intention to have the complete poem published only after his death. Certainly, the notes on the Irish parliament and on Walpole and the Queen would provoke both English and Irish interests, as King and Pope realised. They would also have done Faulkner a deal of harm. His publishing relationship with Swift, both profitable and dangerous, had led to his arrest for libel on three occasions between 1731/2 and 1737. 9 The second provision Faulkner made for readers' additions also suggests that very little indeed lay outside Faulkner's ability to provide. The simple fact is that he left exactly estimated space beneath the printed text for all subsequent manuscript additions as we know them (with the possible exception of the note at l. 345 on the Irish Parliament, which is cramped even in the MoU copy) and ostentatiously inserted clues to their continuation. The notes which in particular carry the Swiftian tone, i.e. on Queen Anne and the medals (l. 184), on Whig vengeance after the Queen's death (l. 379), and on the pusillanimity of the Irish peers (l. 439), all break in the middle of a printed sentence, and yet provide no more and no less space for the various versions of known manuscript continuations. Swift's scathing attack on the Irish parliament (l. 445) generated a footnote simply beginning with the word The , but again the space to be filled—by a neat secretarial hand (MoU) if not by an untidy scrawl (ICN)—is precisely calculated. It would seem, therefore, that although Faulkner's Advertisement may be explained by political discretion, there is no compelling reason to see it as an excuse for an imperfect text. There is reason for regarding it as a coverup, a device to catch the reader's inquisitive instinct. The MoU copy does state that the Notes were 'printed against the Author's Judgment (not to say Co¯ands)', and if this says anything, it suggests that Swift's Notes were supplied to Faulkner in a provisional form, i.e. complete enough to allocate space for them, but not 'final' versions ready for publication. Finally, the examination of copies unknown to Williams above yields the following: l. 194 n. The CSmH Bathurst folio, p. 12, has the MS reading became his mortal Enemy which ICN S926 gives, the latter stating that the alternative reading exists 'in another printed copy.' The reading common to both copies therefore comes from an as yet unrecorded copy of S926. The Bathurst folio does have some textual importance, since it is copied from at least two printed versions of S926. All of its readings and alternatives are to be found in known copies, except this one. l. 294 n. The reading 'Jesus' (LVA-F, CSmH, 410 2 ) also exists in TxU 1 , and unless the latter were copied from one of the former provides further confirmation (if any were needed) of this being the intended reading (rather than, for example, 'Moses', a reading for which Williams gives no source). l. 340 The four lines of verse marked in LVA-F for insertion (as by Dowden on the flyleaf of 410 2 , taken from 'a copy of the second Dublin edition'), also appear in TxU 2 : this may be the hitherto unidentified copy Dowden used, or an indication that a further sub-group of annotations existed. l. 345 n. Williams used the CSmH Bathurst folio, S922, to supply this note, stating that it existed in no other copy ( Poems , II, 566). But the note appears in three other copies of the Faulkner edition, from which the Bathurst copy was completed, i.e. MoU, ICN, TxU 1 . This can only strengthen Williams's supposition that this note 'may have come originally from Swift himself.' The CSmH Bathurst folio MS additions incorporate all of Faulkner's printed notes, completes them in manuscript, includes the lines suppressed by King and Pope, and even copies out verbatim the Advertisement which only appears in Faulkner's Dublin edition. Williams cites Bathurst S922 (the Huntington copy) for ll. 360, 384, 422, 427, 447. All of these readings are to be found in TxU 1 S926, however. If copies of annotated S926 are at one remove from Swift's manuscript, the Bathurst folio is at two removes, and has no independent textual authority, except in making clear that MS textual variants exist in at least two printed copies of S926. Teerink indicates that Faulkner's five 1739 editions of the Verses are all of the same printing, the alterations concerning especially some of the notes, and afterwards almost exclusively the punctuation, and that variants occur because sheets from one edition were wrongly mated with those of another. 10 One previously unnoticed error is the apparently random correction of an erroneous catch-word between pp. 24-25 (C4 v -D1 4 ). Incorrect in MoU, CSmH, TxU 1 , TxU 2 (and in the unannotated Yale copy) but corrected in 410 1 , 410 2 , ICN, it is possible that page 24 was set without the footnotes being included, i.e. with the average of 20 lines of text. But in that case the oversight was remedied before printing started by simply removing six lines and taking them over to p. 25. In either case the footnote was available whilst setting up type, and before printing began, a further indication that Faulkner possessed full knowledge of the complete text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III On January 5, 1738/9 William King wrote to Swift explaining the reasons for cuts made in the original manuscript. Having taken legal advice, which apparently suggested that the lines on Queen Anne's death and the lines on the Whig ministry's actions following the accession of the King could be construed as treasonable, cuts were reluctantly made. Other cuts were made in deference to Pope's judgment (letter to Mrs. Whiteway, January 30, 1738/9), and King goes on in the former letter to say that since the story of the medals 'is pretty well known . . . care has been taken that almost every reader may be able to supply the blanks.' As we have seen, variants crept in; but the note is far more inflammatory than the text and is present in all copies with ms. additions. The likelihood of this note coming directly from Swift is undeniable. As a gesture of conciliation towards Swift's supposed displeasure at the cuts, King offered the following: "if after having received the printed copies, which I will send you next week, you shall resolve to have the poem published intire as you put it into my hands , I will certainly obey your commands, if I can find a proper person to undertake the work. I shall go to London the latter end of the next week, when I'll write to you by a private hand more fully than I can venture by the post ( Correspondence , V, 133 [my italics]). But King was forestalled. On March 6, King wrote again to Mrs. Whiteway, revealing Faulkner's undoubtedly authorised scheme to expose the discrepancy between the King-Pope version and the original manuscript: "I was not a little mortified yesterday, when the bookseller brought me the Dublin edition, and at the same time put into my hands a letter he had received from Faulkner , by which I perceive the Dean is much dissatisfied with our manner of publication, and that so many lines have been omitted, if Faulkner speaks truth, and knows as much of the Dean's mind as he pretends to know. Faulkner hath sent over several other copies to other booksellers; so that I take it for granted this will soon be reprinted there from the Dublin edition. . ." ( Correspondence , V, 139). Such obliquity is characteristic of Swift's methods of arranging the publication of his works, and although only incomplete printed notes were added in Faulkner's Dublin edition, it was in conformity with Swift's known intention as expressed in the letter of May 1, 1733, to Pope. There would be no point, and some danger, in Faulkner sending to King's London bookseller transcriptions of notes which King and Pope had already cut out on treasonable grounds. Again, it would appear that the complete Notes were to be kept for private release, if at all, by Faulkner in Dublin. There could have been only two sources for this: a manuscript by Swift himself, or more likely copies circulated with Swift's tacit approval, in which relatively minor variants flourished in the absence of an authoritative printed text, as ICN makes clear at 278 n (see above) and as Faulkner's Advertisement makes plain. Additional evidence for the latter is contained in the prefatory matter to Faulkner's Dublin edition of Swift's Works , 4 vols., 1735, for the second volume of which (containing the poems) corrections were made from a copy of the Miscellanies , 1727-32 (Rothschild) in Swift's own hand. In the Publisher's Advertisement the formula 'the supposed Author' (also used in S926) is used half a dozen times. Williams is led to suspect on stylistic grounds that the Advertisement was actually written not by Faulkner but by Swift himself. Be this as it may, the Preface describes Swift's willingness to allow manuscript copies to circulate: "If we are truly informed, the supposed Author hath often protested, that he never did write three Copies of Verses with the least Intention to have them printed, although he was easy enough to show them to his Friends, and at their Desire was not very scrupulous in suffering them to take Copies." 11 Williams (III, 827-829) describes the same circumstance in relation to the Legion Club (1736), and reproduces Faulkner's claim to have used Swift's own manuscript for his text of the poem in 1762/3. Of the 1762 Works , Faulkner writes in 'To the Reader' of how Swift 'corrected every Sheet of the first seven Volumes that were published in his Life Time, desiring the Editor to write Notes' (I, vii). Faulkner goes on to affirm that the intimacy and professional trust between author and printer extended even to Swift's private admission of A Tale of a Tub 's authorship. Even so, it is beyond belief that Faulkner himself could have written, except to Swift's dictation, the notes on the Queen, the medals, and on the Irish parliament—all of which were withheld from the Notes. Faulkner's role as editor and publisher was explanatory, not evaluative. Of the nearly seventy notes by Faulkner included in Williams's edition a very few supply names for textual blanks, seven are broadly concerned with defining cant words or linguistic usage; eleven concern details of Dublin topography or Irish customs; fifteen deal with textual history and dating of the poems; thirty-four are concerned with details of characters mentioned, with biographical notes and comments on Swift's circle of friends. Only two quite exceptional notes rise to the level of either rage or raillery comparable with the notes to the Verses . That on Smedley (III, 893)— 'A very stupid, insolent, factious, deformed, conceited Parson, a vile Pretender to Poetry, preferred by the D. of Grafton for his wit'—reads like Swift's own revenge on the compiler of Gulliveriana (1728) and the author of An Epistle to . . . Grafton contained therein. 12 The second, on Sheridan (III, 1012-13), includes a signed affidavit from Sheridan himself and appears to be a fragment of the Swift-Sheridan bagatelle which flourished for many years, and which Faulkner simply reproduces. Swift's efforts were often deliberately employed to resist attempts at attribution. He delighted both to cover his tracks and to observe closely the efforts of his pursuers. For this reason Faulkner especially was required to adopt a policy of seemingly naive ignorance. Proximity to Swift demanded impersonal detachment as a publisher, hence my argument that Faulkner knew more than he could say and possessed more than he could print. Negative external evidence, paradoxically, only increases this conviction. Thus, if Faulkner knew precisely what was missing in the 1739 octavo Verses , in 1746 he had an opportunity to bring out a truly complete (and posthumous) edition of the poem in the Works . The new Publisher's Advertisement promises exactly this: The following Poem was printed and published in London, with great Success. Many Lines and Notes were omitted in the English Edition, which we have here inserted, to make this Work as compleat as possible. Faulkner does make some emendations, but only of a minor stylistic and factual nature. For example, the note on Pulteney is updated (he was made Earl of Bath in 1742); Friendship replaces Favour in the note on Lady Suffolk; the variant line ' I led a Heart ' persists; the last note states that Swift had died in Ireland; and the earlier note stating that Swift was 'not acquainted with one single Lord Spiritual or Temporal' now reads 'not acquainted with many Lords Spiritual or Temporal.' But with only one important exception (l. 277, where Walpole's name is inserted), all the blanks remain blank, none of the known manuscript continuations is included, and no space is provided for the missing notes. Moreover, the fact that Faulkner makes no reference to his own 1739 edition but states on the 1746 title-page that the Verses were 'Printed in the Year 1743' suggests that this edition of the poem was determined by other than a desire for a canonical text. As a testimony of loyalty to Swift's known desire not to have the complete poem printed before his death, Faulkner's continuingly incomplete text is, at the very least, a remarkable example of a self-denying ordinance. For subsequent editors, this could have closed the door on all attempts at reconstruction. But it is in no sense the last word. Instead of settling questions, it poses more. At lines 183-187 (the medals episode) Faulkner's 1746 text provides yet another set of variants, indicating if nothing else that none of the manuscript additions in the S926s examined here could have been transcribed from this later edition. All relate back to an earlier and arguably single manuscript source. Faulkner thus evaded the task of producing a public text of the Verses 'as compleat as possible' in 1746. It is only to the purchasers of the 'private', annotated text of the 1739 octavo that we can refer for evidence that complete notes certainly existed, remarkably consistent with each other across at least eight different contemporary manuscript copies, and in a form known to Faulkner in 1739. Swift's death did not stop the flow of dangerous new copy to Faulkner, as the analogous publishing history of An Epistle to a Lady and On Poetry: A Rapsody shows; 13 the printer's risky game of textual hide-and-seek was still necessary in order to avoid the continuing threat of legal consequences. But as far as the Verses was concerned, at least some of Faulkner's customers had fully availed themselves of his invitation to fill in the blanks for themselves. 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Although my primary concern in what follows is neither with the textual history of the Verses nor with its critical interpretations, it would be foolish to separate discussion of the Notes as a narrowly editorial and textual problem from judgments about Swift's style, intention and motives in the text of the poem. My argument is that the Notes belong integrally to the text. There is no previous discussion of Williams's reconstruction of the Notes, but for the textual and critical fortunes and misfortunes of the poem, see A. H. Scouten and R. D. Hume, 'Pope and Swift: Text and Interpretation of Swift's Verses on His Death', Philological Quarterly , 52 (1973), 205-31. 2 Cf. John Hayward, ed. Nonesuch Swift (1934), pp. 812-813, 866-868; Pat Rogers, ed., Jonathan Swift: The Complete Poems , Harmondsworth, 1983, pp. 846-857 (the gaps in Rogers's text are 'normally filled out from' the copy in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library and two copies in the Williams Collection, Cambridge University Library, and they are sometimes referred to as Swift's and sometimes as 'note in Faulkner edn'); and, most recently, Angus Ross and David Woolley, eds., Jonathan Swift (Oxford Authors), 1984, pp. 514-530, who restore the footnotes to their proper place but make no comment on their provenance or status. 3 All quotations are from Williams's second edition of The Poems of Jonathan Swift (1958), and are given in the text by volume number and page. 4 Irvin Ehrenpreis, Swift: The Man, his Works and the Age (1967-83), III, 713. 5 Reproduced by permission of the Librarian, Monash University.

(1975), I, 774-775. 8 Sherburn suggests ( The Correspondence of Alexander Pope [1956], IV, 129-130) that Lord Orrery may also have had a hand in editing the Verses . This is possible, but the evidence suggests only that Orrery delivered a copy of the poem for Pope's opinion. Pope wrote to Orrery on 25 September, 1738: "I return the Verses you favord me with, the latter part of which is inferior to the beginning, the Character too dry, as well as too Vain in some respects, &amp; in one or two particulars, not true." Scouten and Hume have pointed out that this accurately foreshadows the nature of the changes King and Pope were to make in the Bathurst edition. Their question is: Why, if the MS Verses were circulating in London in mid-1738, did Swift bother to send a copy to William King? This rhetorical question conceals a particular and largely neglected literary alliance formed between King and Swift in the mid-1730s. The first element in King's poem The Toast (Dublin, 1732-36), Epistola ad Cadenum , was inscribed to Swift and 'contains some of the most elegant tributes ever paid to Swift. None of the standard works on Swift makes reference to it, and . . . no English translation of it has appeared' (David Greenwood, William King: Tory and Jacobite (1969), p. 57). In Political and Literary Anecdotes of his Own Times (second edition, 1819, pp. 97-98) King says that Swift not only perused 'the greatest part of it in the manuscript' and encouraged King to finish it, but had been 'chiefly pleased with the notes'. Inspired by the example of Pope's Dunciad , King put his defamatory attacks into (Latin) notes. Thus King and Swift share the feature of libellous annotations, and King may have provided Swift with a textual model. King also remarks that Swift informed a lady relative that 'if he had read the TOAST when he was twenty years of age, he never would have wrote a satire.' It seems to me that the real mystery is not Swift's choice of King, to whom the MS of The Four Last Years was also to be entrusted via Orrery in July 1737, but the role of Orrery in relation to the Verses . Greenwood cites a previously unknown letter from King to Orrery, for 8 July 1738, stating that 'Roch [i.e. the Verses ] is in the press, and shall certainly be published in September or the beginning of the next Term. I believe I mentioned to you the accidents which had retarded the publication of this work so long, when I had the honour of seeing you last' (pp. 86-87). On 9 November 1736 ( Correspondence, IV, 542) King writes to Mrs. Whiteway about 'the little MS' (i.e. not the History of the Four Last Years ) which he will soon put to the press. Teerink ( A Bibliography of the Writings . . . of . . . Swift (1937), pp. 303-304) suggested that this may have been the C version (i.e. what became Faulkner's 1739 Dublin octavo), in which case this is the earliest conjectured mention of the complete Verses . Orrery wrote to Swift, 23 July 1737, that 'Your commands are obeyed long ago. Dr King has his cargo' (referring, apparently, to the History ), and he also acted as go-between for the affair of the Pope-Swift letters (see Ehrenpreis, III, 887-898). If Orrery also carried the MS Verses for Swift to England, it seems that the MS may have been sent back from King to Orrery via Pope. It is a pity that Orrery, a trusted emissary of Swift in other respects, was also prone to exaggerate and therefore obscure if not deliberately distort his knowledge of Swift's publishing strategies: on 6 October 1740, he informed Pope: 'I shall not be surprised to see the dean's manuscripts of all kinds in print. To give you one instance of the careless unsuspicious manner in which they are kept, out of thirteen volumes in manuscript on one particular subject he has lost ten' ( Correspondence of Pope , IV, 276). Even so, the possibility exists that Orrery may be one of the targets for Faulkner's 'Publisher's Advertisement', which solicits help from those who had seen the MS. 9 See Robert E. Ward, Prince of Dublin Printers: The Letters of George Faulkner (1972), pp. 9-14. 10 Herman Teerink, A Bibliography of the Writings of Jonathan Swift , second edition, Revised and Corrected, ed.

      <field name="heading_text">The Album (1826): The Significance of the Recently Discovered Second Volume by James Everett Kibler, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In 1952, the editors of The Letters of William Gilmore Simms made known the existence of The Album (1825) for the first time. 1 Heretofore, this earliest Charleston literary magazine, unique in the South to its day as a journal devoted exclusively to literature and significant because it was W. G. Simms's first editorial venture, had not been known beyond a prospectus in the Charleston newspapers. W. P. Trent, Simms's biographer, had not mentioned it; 2 and various scholars had concluded that The Album was never published. "Projected but did not appear" and "failed to materialize" were the verdicts. 3 Still after three decades, the copy used by the editors of the Letters in 1952 is the only one to surface. 4 John Guilds, in the first study of The Album , explored the magazine's importance, which he rightly found to be considerable. 5 His article, while still largely accurate in its assessments, now requires a few corrections, some refinings of several points, and the addition of significant new information, some of which is of major importance to Simms biography. All are made possible by the recent discovery of a second volume of The Album , 6 the existence of which no one had guessed. The Album , Volume I, was published from 2 July 1825 to 24 December 1825, for a total of 26 numbers in 210 pages. 7 Volume II began with a first issue of 7 January 1826 and ran at least through the 25th issue of 24 June 1826, for 200 pages. (Volume II may also have continued with a 26th number, but issue 25 is the last we have to date.) The format 8 and editorial policy of Volume II remained essentially unchanged, as an octavo weekly costing 25 cents per week, and published by Gray and Ellis at No. 9 Broad-Street. Its editors continued to encourage local Southern contributors of original material and repeated that they would not serve up European reprints and translations, or borrow heavily from the files of other periodicals for copy. Their three great emphases remained demanding high literary quality, publishing original productions, and "cultivating Native Talent ." For the last-named purpose, they began offering premiums in March 1826 for the best original essay and story, to be judged by a "Committee of Literary Gentlemen" II (11 March, 1826), p. 76. One significant alteration in format, however, was the addition of the subtitle, " Or, Charleston Literary Gazette ." This change pointed even more clearly to the editor's intention of making The Album the South's first exclusively literary magazine. More importantly, it suggests the possibility of continuity between The Album and Simms's next editorial endeavor, The Southern Literary Gazette , published in Charleston from 1828-1829. 9 It is not unlikely that there was some 1827 bridge between The Album, Or, Charleston Literary Gazette of 1826 and The Southern Literary Gazette of 1828, particularly when one considers Simms's statement that he "commenced editing" at 18 and "continued to do so until I was 23," in other words from 1824 to 1829 (16 October 1841, Letters , I, 285). Although no issue of a Volume III is known, the strong possibility of its existence should not be discounted. For after all, it has taken over a century for Volume I to surface and a century and a half for Volume II. With the discovery of Volume II and thus a knowledge of another six months of life for the periodical, John Guilds's statement about The Album 's quick demise requires adjustment: "in view of the fact that the Album was admittedly a literary miscellany in a political-minded section, was edited by inexperienced hands, and lacked even the attraction of European reprints or translations, it seems surprising that it survived for as long as six months" ( SB , 8 (1956), 175). The record now stands that the journal lasted at least a year, and perhaps continued more or less unbroken in a new form, The Southern Literary Gazette , until 1829. Charleston, once called "that deathbed of Southern periodicals," may thus have claimed one less casualty. Judging from Simms's own recollection of the great number of rival literary societies of young men in the city in the 1820's, who pooled their books and encouraged the performance of drama and the writing and discussion of essays, poetry, and fiction, one must conclude that there was a very great interest in and vigorous support of literature. In fact, Simms recalled that there were during the time of The Album 's publication "fully twenty or thirty of these juvenile societies, counting each from twenty to forty members." 10 It was, he concluded, "a period of great literary activity, among all classes." The extent of Charleston's support of literary activities in the 1820's may thus require further examination. The Album did not fold so rapidly as has been thought. The section was indeed "political-minded"; but there was apparently much more interest in the arts than the popular twentieth-century view has credited. The mistaken assumption that there were few interested in literature in the Charleston of this time may have also led to the conclusion that Simms was very possibly the sole editor of The Album and indeed wrote most of its copy. 11 Volume II proves conclusively that he was not, and did not. The editors of The Album called themselves a "Society of Young Gentlemen," and they indeed were. One should not "hazard a guess that young Gilmore was the only editor, posing as the 'Society of Young Gentlemen' in an effort to hide his identity and to win supporters for what seemed a community project" ( ibid. , pp. 171-172), for it certainly was just that, an undertaking in which several members of a segment of the literary community each had a hand. As the evidence of Volume II reveals, Simms made a journey to the Southwest from January through April 1826 and was thus not in residence while most of Volume II issued from Charleston week after week. Although he continued to send poems and letters back for publication through the post, this "Society of Young Gentlemen" kept up its work and in the manner it had before his leaving, and, as already shown, with emphases and editorial policies unchanged. In other words, although he was likely a most valuable staff member, perhaps even the most energetic one, he was not indispensable. The "Society" continued to rely heavily on his pen for original contributions, to an amazingly great extent considering he was some thousand miles distant; but at least one other prolific contributor, most probably a member of the editorial staff, can now be identified. That contributor was William Allen, a young Charlestonian whom Simms recalled in 1870 as "another of those promising lads of literature in our city . . . a ready and indefatigable writer in prose and verse, . . . the writer of more than one novel, or romance, of the old English narrative school, . . . a thin, nervous person, of spasmodic eagerness and impulse" who "dabbled in chemistry as well as literature" and who died young, "having swallowed a solution of phosphorus in mistake for water" ( Reminiscences , pp. 921-922). Simms further recalled that among Allen's pennames were "Juan," "J. A. O.," "Rinaldo," and "St. Eustace." (Simms probably erred slightly here; the last two should read "Roderick" and "St. Pierre.") To Volume I, Allen contributed at least twelve poems and five prose works under these pseudonyms and his initials "W. A." 12 For Volume II, he wrote at least four poems for the eight extant issues, using pseudonyms "Juan," "I. A. O." and "St. Pierre"; and there are prose works also likely by him. In addition to Allen, the publishers Gray and Ellis had some hand in important matters; 13 and James Wright Simmons (1790-1858), coeditor with Simms of The Southern Literary Gazette of 1828, may have been a member of the editorial circle. He was a very strong influence on and close friend of Simms during the time, and had worked on the staff of the New York Mirror , which periodical Guilds has proved to be a model for The Album . 14 Hence, though Simms was an active member of the editorial staff, The Album in no way could be considered a one-man project. Later, as editor of The Magnolia and The Southern and Western Monthly Magazine , he would indeed be sole editor and primary contributor; but with The Album he was an important part of a communal effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Simms in THE ALBUM (1826) The newly-discovered volume reveals biographical information about Simms which is of the first importance. For here he published a series of four letters from the West 15 that documents a heretofore unrecorded trip to the frontier in early 1826, thus requiring certain revisions of our notions about this primary formative influence on his career. In 1933, Hampton Jarrell and William Stanley Hoole explored in three articles the significance of the frontier travels as a shaping force on Simms's writing. 16 As a result of their work, they were able to prove two Southwestern journeys; whereas Trent (fifty years before them) had shown positively only one. These two trips were made in 1824-1825 and in 1831. The Album 's second volume now proves a third journey of 1826, thus Simms's second jaunt West, this time carefully detailed as to route. His excursion can be reconstructed from the letters as follows. Simms sailed from Charleston 12 January 1826, then passed the Florida Keys within fifty miles and in sight of the Cuban shore "at 54° North," before stopping on land for the first time eighteen days later at the Balize, "a resort for Pilots and Fishermen" some ninety-five or a hundred miles from New Orleans. He then sailed up the mouth of the Mississippi to within fifteen miles of New Orleans, where he took "a kind of chariot" into the city. There, on the day of his arrival, he wrote his first letter of 3 February 1826. From New Orleans he travelled "by water" to Mobile, crossing Lake Pontchartrain and Spanish River. He arrived at Mobile some time before 13 February 1826, from where he wrote his second letter. He then "took passage on board a steam boat . . . up the Tombigbee River" to Columbus, Mississippi, where on 1 March 1826, he wrote Letter III. After having remained at Columbus for "a week or more," he proceeded "over the Tombigbee" by "flat" to the Choctaw Nation and proceeded by horse through swamp and prairie to Pearl River. Although he did not give his specific destination, Simms no doubt made his journey, as he had the year before, in order to visit his father who lived at Georgeville, Holmes County, Mississippi, some sixty miles north of Jackson. By 12 April 1826, he had completed "my excursion to Pearl River" and was back in Columbus, Mississippi, where he wrote Letter IV. After his stay in Columbus, he planned to "start directly on to Charleston," which likely meant that he travelled downstream from Columbus to Mobile and thence home. 17 The date he returned to Charleston is unknown, but the entire Western journey must have been of no less than four months' duration. In his four letters, he gave impressions of customs, social life, women, the theatre, the court room, 18 steamboat travel, and flora, descriptions of squatters, Indians, the Choctaw Nation, and candid opinions about New Orleans, Mobile, Columbus, the backwoods between and the frontier beyond. These early accounts would be significant enough in themselves even were the author unknown, but the value to our understanding of Simms's life and career is rather staggering. First of all, they are his earliest surviving letters. The six volume Letters of William Gilmore Simms begins with an entry dated 16 July 1830, over four years later than The Album epistles. Considering the scarcity of primary information on the young author, who was but nineteen years old at the time, the material gleaned from these sources is of paramount importance. The letters reveal their writer to be a strongly opinionated young gentleman who has carefully viewed his world and made up his mind about certain things. He has the highest scorn for materialistic values and finds the mere money-seeker dull and base. He himself has already chosen to devote his energies to higher goals. Nature is obviously a first love. Her beauties are a great solace throughout his travels, which are at times tedious and strenuous. For wild nature, he reserves his only unqualified praise. The Mississippi River, he calls "majestic" and a "proud and beautiful sight." The Southwestern prairies are "not only singular, but stupendous." In short, the unspoiled landscape inspires and awes him. The works of man, however, are a terrible disappointment, and he describes his dissatisfaction in no uncertain terms. New Orleans is "nothing more" than a "mere place of business" where money is the great measure, and money-making the chief drive of life. Gambling, and every other form of money-oriented vice, is carried on "to a most enormous extent." At the New Exchange, "at one view, will present an auctioneer straining his lungs to the utmost; a bar keeper circulating through the medium of a tobacco burnt atmosphere, his spirits ; a couple of foggy CANAILLE . . . diabolically intent on the result of a layer of domino; and in several other sections of the room, cards, dice, billiards, and as many other modes by which money can be won or lost, as ---- himself could invent." He is finally "disgusted" by the city—its vice, filth, and shoddiness, all faults stemming from mistaken values. Even the American Theatre leaves him "completely disgusted." And as for the Masquerade Ball he attends, it is but a "ridiculously odd assemblage," where a "scamp of the first water, wore the fool's cap and bells, ill assorted with Minerva's underclothes, etc." His summation: New Orleans is "a vile reservoir of infamy and baseness," a raw boom town revolving around the marketplace. Of Mobile, he is only slightly less critical, her central focus likewise being the making of wealth. Its theatre is better than the American in the former city, but there are frequent interruptions by backwoodsmen who had never seen such things before. The pitiful tribal outcasts from the Choctaw Nation line her streets, sadly a "public nuisance and offending forever the eye of delicacy." Of the Mobile Bar, its pleadings are "dull, heavy and unimportant." He sets out at last for the wilderness "perfectly fatigued with Mobile." These works portray the world realistically as he found it and without idealization, but always measured against an implied high ideal. The author is finally, then, bored by these specific "places of business" and in general with a frontier society based on the philosophy of getting rich quick. The last he will simply not tolerate; and as for himself, after visiting his father, he would return home to Charleston. By 1826, the young Simms had apparently reached the conclusion, which he was to voice frequently throughout his life, that the impulse to westward migration was largely ignoble, stemming from the basic vice of material greed. He thus found the frontier a deleterious force on society, encouraging rootlessness, the breaking of ties, and the undermining of those established centers necessary to the furthering of the noble ideals of high culture which he already espoused. These letters thus point to what must have been a central conflict within the young writer in 1826: whether to reestablish familial ties in a West he abjured as a destructive force, or to remain without family in his home community which encouraged the higher cultural values he had come most to admire. At the age of nineteen, Simms was obviously a high-toned young patrician who valued honor, dignity, propriety, and artistic endeavor, and deemed materialistic values at best boring and at worst "disgusting." When encouraged by his father to relocate to the West and make his fortune, he would, therefore, judging from the philosophy expressed in these letters, understandably, say no. That the young man was doggedly devoted to principles, intolerant, and headstrong, these letters also provide considerable proof, thus demonstrating the necessary ability to make his decision stick. These epistles also contribute, beyond revelations about the life and personality of the man, key insights into a time when Simms's literary career was being born. As an example of their great significance in this sphere, one has only to consider the last section of Letter IV. From Columbus, Mississippi, 12 April 1826, in writing of incidents of travel through the Choctaw Nation, Simms presented this comic sketch: One of our companions was altogether an oddity. A Frenchman by birth; [he] had been much of a traveller—but was altogether unacquainted with our pristine neighbors [the Choctaws]—and the sight of one of them appearing suddenly before him in the road, was sufficient to elicit from him "Diable! vat is dat?" "Why that," said a rigid featured moralist, who had joined us at the same time, and was apparently disposed to make as much of the Frenchman's ignorance as possible, "that is an alligator, Monseure." This was evidently an overstretch, and Monsieur cut his eyes sharply on the respondent but said nothing. "Is it not singular," said my former companion, "how those Indian horses will endure fatigue. A journey that one of our noblest steeds would sink under totally nerveless, will rather induce so their vigor, and the long gallop of that little tackey will be continued without interruption during the whole day and for weeks." "Yes," said our new comer, whom I now observed, pretended somewhat to the character of a wit, "Yes, they are certainly a singularly fine animal; they do not hesitate to ascend rocks perfectly perpendicular, and the Indians frequently send them up the hickory trees for the purpose of gathering the nuts from them; and it is not uncommon where no rocks can be found for the owners to dislodge their hoops to crack them on." We smiled—and the Frenchman betrayed his wonder by the wonted—"Diable." By this time, the Indian, whom we soon discovered to be a Chief, by his scarlet cloak, cocked hat, plume and nose ring, and the other various concomitants to manly display, approached us; and after the usual salutation, "How do?" our jovial companion desired to know how much ahead the traveller was who had passed yesterday. "Ek-sho," (gone away!) "You one very fine hors, Monsieur," observed the little Frenchman, rather cautiously to the rover. "Yaow! chickamafena," (yes, very fine, good or great.) "Your chick-a," said the inquirer to himself half mutteringly, yet afraid to press the question to the Chief that presented itself to his mind. "He means," said the little man's tormentor, "that he should be good when fed on chickens." The Indian showed some dissent to this explanation and it was explained to the satisfaction of all. Whiskey, the staple of the country, and almost the only liquor drank, was produced from the saddle bags of one of the party, and after passing it round, we parted with our savage brother mutually satisfied. Here, then, in rough and fledgling form, is Simms's first known use of backwoods humor, and published, incidentally, nearly a decade before the issuing of A. B. Longstreet's Georgia Scenes (1835), commonly accepted as the seminal work of the genre. The vigorous little sketch which comes to dominate the Pearl River epistle shows enthusiasm for this material. Though he could never favor Western migration, he was quick to realize the lively drama it presented. It is as if Simms, while writing this sketch for a Charleston audience, opened his eyes wide for the first time to rich sources which would lead very shortly to realistic treatments of the Border in five novels, 19 and finally to such excellent backwoods humor stories as "Sharp Snaffles" and "Bald-Head Bill Bauldy." It is interesting to note also that no such backwoods rendering had been published in The Album in 1825 after his first trip west. The introduction of the awe-inspiring Choctaw Chief, the description of his clothing and ornament, and the rendering of his speech all likewise demonstrate a knowledge of materials Simms was perhaps to find useful in his treatments of the Indian in such works as "Indian Sketch," the story of a Choctaw which was Simms's first fictional treatment of the Indian (1828), and The Yemassee , his Indian novel of 1835. It is not surprising that Simms's treatment of Indian character would be called "probably the most balanced" in American literature. 20 For records such as these letters prove that he knew the material first hand and was interested in recording the facts. One of the most significant bits of information to be gleaned from this letter of 12 April is Simms's statement that he was keeping a good "note book" of what he was seeing and hearing. Was he not, then, intending to make literary use of these backwoods experiences? And was not, then, one purpose of his travels, to gather such native American materials for future use? The material in this same note book may have been either in hand or in mind when he came to write "Sharp Snaffles." 21 While Simms drew most heavily for this story from lore that he recorded in an 1847 journal of hunting trips in the Carolina mountains, 22 The Album sketch and "Sharp Snaffles" have some interesting similarities. First, "Yaou" is the name given Sharp Snaffles by the members of the hunting camp. One hunter explains that "in the Choctaw dialect" the word "simply means 'yes,'" as it is related in The Album sketch. "Snaffles," he remarks, "had rambled considerably among the Choctaws, and picked up a variety of their words." So, evidently, had Mr. Simms. And Sharp, renowned as the best teller of tall yarns in his parts, bears some resemblance to the local "wit" of the sketch, whose great pleasure comes in trying to create belief in outlandish statements delivered in deadpan manner—the whole purpose of the hunter's "lying camp" as recorded in "Sharp Snaffles." Finally, The Album sketch ends by the group "liquoring," an action also important to the framing device of the short story. Further, this sketch is likewise significant as the first known example of what would become a separate story type in the Southern backwoods humor genre—that of the dandy greenhorn being gulled by the backwoodsman. The greenhorn was frequently to be a Yankee city-slicker, or only a city-slicker come to the country; but often enough too he would be a European, and most frequently a Frenchman, as he is here in the Simms sketch. In addition to "Letters from the West," Simms contributed by post to the eight extant issues of Volume II, sixteen poems certain to be by him and another two which may be his. Three of these are again biographically significant. "Song" describes the voyager-narrator's impressions of sea travel around the Florida Keys 23 within view of the Cuban shore at sunset. The poem was written on the spot in January 1826 and sent back to Charleston with the first Western letter. In the letter itself, he noted that "Song" was composed during a calm at sea and "without much regard to meter." Of such poetic endeavor, he wrote in Letter I during a moment of weariness and depression: "I have grown quite indifferent to such efforts, and will in future endeavor to forget that I was ever capable of them. They have been more a pain than a pleasure; and in other views have been an injury." No matter, later issues of The Album continued to contain his verse sent from the West in undiminished quantity. "I Do Not Ask Thy Tear" is dated Columbus, Miss., 10 April 1826; and another "Song" is said to be written while on the Tombeckbee River in Alabama. 24 Moreover, of the sixteen proved poems, ten are heretofore unrecorded, 25 and the other six are the original publications of later versions. The newly discovered poems are marked with an asterisk and are reprinted in the Appendix. 26 Through these issues of Volume II, therefore, knowledge of the early poetic career (his first proved poem had appeared only less than two years before), has been substantially increased. The following listing, based on the format of John Guilds's article on The Album , presents Simms's contributions to the newly-discovered issues of Volume II: 27 I.

Not mine the joys of gilded balls, Their sweets are vain to me; Sweeter the breath of music falls, Amid the mountains' airy halls, For there my form is free; No fetter'd duties bind my soul, I spurn their slavish—cold controul, For Oh! I love to be A fellow with the desart rock, That meets unmoved the tempest's shock. Soul of my soul! for there I meet Objects, like thee in ruin laid: Young Fancy, whom I hold most dear, Leads on my wayward footsteps there, To rocks in gloom arrayed; And tells me that I now am free— These tempest-riven sites for me, And no one else were made; These rocks—this firmament divine, In all their solitude, are mine. And then I hold myself alone; No slavish thought can dare Intrude upon my desart throne, Or bid me for a moment own, A lord or rival there; But every dream, like morning light, Be pure, fantastical and bright, Dress'd in such gaudy glare, That rime shall pause and feel his power, Subdued even by the desart flower. TO --- --- The dreams that in my slumbers glow, Dear maid, thou well mayst deem, Derive their source from hopes that now, Within my bosom teem. And how can dreams do ought than give, Imagined joys with thee, Since waking, all that bids me live, Are dreams, I hope may be. In dreaming joys, my nights are spent; And hopes, dear Love, divide The hours that gaudy day has sent, Like sunbeams on the tide. And these are joys—but ah! too vain, Since hopes are apt to fly; And dreams we know will sometimes pain, When known, reality. Then would'st thou chasten doubt, and quell The grief that yet may rise, Each dream that gives a charm, compel Thy heart to realize; And give the spell that ever seems, To call forth joys ideal; Let all my early hopes be dreams But let those dreams be real. INVOCATION. By Almirez. Come, o'er the waste of water's blue, The Memory of other years; Come, and recall my infant view— My early joys and tears. Shadows of former times—again With icy lip, and sunken eye, And pallid brow, and rattling brain, Ye wander sadly by. I'll wake a harp of former tone, Again a being shall ye dream; And all that once ye deem'd your own, Shall either be—or seem. Sorrows—the shades of former years, Joys—that ye thought could never fly. Each in the visioned scene appears, To pain or please the eye. And whilst ye wander o'er the hours, That wizard fancy waken yet; Beware! ye rove in other bowers— The present, ye have never met. The present! lo! his form is here, There's sadness in his very smile; A mingled tint of hope and fear, That cannot grief beguile: A frozen image that seems fix'd, In death's embrace with smiling lips, Whilst light and darkness there is mix'd, Like Phoebus in a brief eclipse. [Untitled] Come! Let thy hair my fingers twine, That rosy lip be laid on mine, That eye so soft, so purely bright, Upon me rest its azure light. Those arms of snow, ah could I dare, I'd have thee softly throw them there, And ah! so kind; so gentle too, Thou'st done what I would have thee do. Those lips—forgive me if I press, They were but formed such hours to bless; Come let those arms around me twine, That throbbing heart be laid on mine. That head, reclined upon my breast, Thus—thus I'll lull thee Love, to rest, And reigning o'er my bosom's throne, Now Rosa, thou art all my own. Thy brow upon my heart is laid, Thy lips are mine, my own dear maid, My daring hand hath wreathed thy hair— Live Rosa, live forever there. BY ALMIREZ. Go, shed the lustre of thine eyes, On other lands, remote from this; And ere their starry brillance dies, Perchance they yet may lead to bliss, But here the charm thou would'st impart, Lacks lustre, for it lacks the heart. And other dreams may wake thy truth, And other beauties lure to love; Then may'st thou whilst in prime of youth, Learn those wild passions to reprove; Which cannot lure, and will not die, But pain in deep intensity. Another land—another hope, May with thy former feelings strive, And, whilst they each for being cope, Still whisper to us that they live; But oh! be mine—the genial sky, The love, the heart that will not fly. DITHYRAMBIC SONG. Fill up the bowl, for why should sorrow, Dim a cup so purely bright; Fill up, and think not on the morrow, Come sun or cloud—be blest to night. Now the ruby Juices flowing, Wit is casting pleasures o'er, Love's arrows set the Goblets glowing, Die away and are no more. Then in wine forget the hour, Love could charm thy soul away, Passion with resistless power, Bids the force of love decay. Cupid angry, lost his glances, Peep'd within the door and frownd; Wit turn'd round, checked his advances; Loves arrow blunted met the ground. Fill up the bowl, Time's wings are moving, Fill up the bowl arrest his flight; O, that we could such joys improving, Change the day and make it night. TO SPAIN. Go weep, go weep—yet not the tear, That from each patriot bosom springs, To Freedom's shrine is half so dear— As those of tyrant kings. 'Tis well, 'tis well—ye yet can weep, If stings of shame ye feel, Go burst the torpid charms of sleep, And rush to meet the steel. It is not tears, it is not tears, Tho' deep the fountains flow, That now can wake a nations fears— And rouse them to the blow. But 'tis the heart, that dares to do, And 'tis the arm that does the deed, One soul of fire, one falchion true, And ye might yet be freed. SONG. Wake, wake, the song! the tyrant care Shall fly e're we shall leave the bowl, Whilst peace and joy shall hover near In all the unity of soul. Wake, wake, the song. Tho' distant regions here unite, Like brothers of one land they join, The cup is sparkling ruby bright, And freedom's nectar is divine. Wake, wake, the song, &amp;c. Here shall no foreign despot wave, His sceptre o'er the free born mind, Or, may the foe who such can brave, The vengeance of a Free-man find. Wake, wake, the song, &amp;c. Wake, wake, the song, in freedom's land, A Freeman's song, must needs be dear, Unclogg'd by slavery's iron band— Undim'd by slavery's burning tear. Wake, wake, the song, &amp;c. Here, torn from every genial tie, The exile seeks no more to roam, He meets a smile in freedom's eye— A solace in a Freeman's home. Wake, wake, the song, &amp;c. THE BLIGHTED TREES. By Almirez. It was but late I sported young, With youth and friendship 'neath these trees, The birds around me sweetly sung, In strains that youthful hearts can please. So green and fresh they bloomed around, That youthful fancy kissed each flower— Alas! tho' bright—they quickly found, The general gift of nature's dower. When friends and boyhood pass'd away, I shed the burning tear of grief, But I have felt my heart decay, More, when I've seen your wither'd leaf. For ye recall those early hours, When joy had lent to youth its ray; When with some school mate plucking flow'rs, We've wil'd unheeded, Time away. Ah! little in those dreams of bliss, My bosom thought on future scenes; 'Twas pass'd away in happiness, Devising youthful frolic schemes. And 'neath these yellow drooping trees, Then bright with life and deep with green, I've lain in youthful hours at ease, Panting, fatigued upon the plain. Each sound, each murmur then seem'd sweet, Some nightingale the boughs beneath; But now those sounds, those murmurs beat, Just like the tempest storms of death. Sweet trees, tho' faded still so dear, Some short time and I too shall fade; Like ye—my heart's already sear, By sorrows frost, like ye decay'd. SONG Written on the Tombeckbee River. Long, long, dearest maiden my footsteps may wander, And find not a resting place ere they return; Yet still o'er the past shall my musing heart ponder, And bury each feeling in memory's urn. The stream I now float on, the dark trees o'er shading, Still recall to my bosom those moments of bliss; When o'er my rapt vision the guileless young maiden, Shed her first ray, 'twas pensive 'twas lovely as this. Oh! deem not the youth, all those feelings despising, Forgetful can dream of another than thee; His bosom but blest when thine own it is prizing, Only longs for the moment when thine it shall see. Thro' the copse dimly seen the pale moonbeam is streaming, O'er the water it mirrors its tremulous glow; And thus thro' my heart thy deep influence is gleaming, With a smile that, tho' pensive, still kindles its flow. Could I task but the winds, and obedience awaken, In aught that opposes my flight love to thee; How soon would I prove that thou wert not forsaken, Nor forgot for a moment by a lover like me. They tell me, and let them, it never can kindle, One doubt of the truth that thy young heart hath sworn; That in absence, the influence of feeling must dwindle, And love be forgotten before his return. But they know not who say it, how tender thy bosom, Nor the truth that dictates it and rules with its sway; But judge that in others the original blossom, As that in their breast will as quickly decay.</field>

It is understandable that one might reach this conclusion in light of Simms's later editorial practice, but The Album proves to be the exception to the rule. 12 Guilds is correct in deducing that "Juan," "Roderick," and "W. A." are one and the same, but errs in believing them to be Simms. See "Simms's First Magazine," p. 183. 13 See The Album , I, 138, and II, 76.

S." may not be Simms is put to rest by the poem sent back with Letter I. "Song" (Calm o'er the wave . . .) was collected the following year in Simms's Lyrical and Other Poems (Charleston: Ellis &amp; Neufville, 1827), pp. 13-14. 16 Hampton Jarrell, "Simms's Visits to the Southwest," American Literature , 5 (1933), 29-35; William Stanley Hoole, "A Note on Simms's Visits to the Southwest," American Literature , 6 (1934), 334-336; and Hoole, "Alabama and W. Gilmore Simms," Alabama Review , 16 (1963), 83-107, and 185-199. 17 On the 1824-1825 trip, William Hoole ("Alabama and W. Gilmore Simms," p. 87) reports that Simms returned "directly" home to Charleston by going from Columbus, Mississippi, eastward to the Warrior River, then down that stream to Mobile, and thence to Charleston. Getting to the Southwest on this trip, he travelled from Charleston "by stagecoach through Augusta to Milledgeville and Fort Mitchell to Montgomery, then down the Alabama River to Selma and Mobile and up the Tombigbee to Demopolis and up the Black Warrior to Tuscaloosa. The last 160 miles westward from Tuscaloosa to Georgeville [Mississippi] he made overland, via Columbus, Louisville and Kosciusko (Mississippi)." In 1831, he used this same 1824 route to Mobile, where he this time took a stage to Pascagoula and from there a steamboat to New Orleans. From New Orleans, he crossed Lake Pontchartrain, rode to Covington, Louisiana, and thence to Columbia, Mississippi. From Columbia, he took a long "hazardous" journey on horseback into the Yazoo region and to Georgeville. See Letters , I, 10-38 for details and descriptions of his travels. It appears likely from a comparison of these routes that Simms was consciously varying his itineraries in order to see more of the country and thus to gather a greater store of material for future literary use. 18 In one such account, he noted attending in Mobile "the trial of a set of Gamblers." To young lawyers of Charleston who cannot find enough business at home, he noted "a fair field open" owing to the "extreme" inferiority of the Bar. The fact that Simms himself would be admitted to the Charleston Bar the following year is of significance in this light. 19 Guy Rivers (1834), Richard Hurdis (1838), Border Beagles (1840), Confession (1841), and Beauchampe (1842). 20 Albert Keiser, The Indian in American Literature (1933), p. 296. 21 "How Sharp Snaffles Got His Capital and Wife" in Writings of William Gilmore Simms , 5 (1974), 421-465. 22 See James Kibler, "Simms' Indebtedness to Folk Tradition in 'Sharp Snaffles,'" Southern Literary Journal , 4 (Spring 1972), 55-68. 23 Simms notes the specific Keys as "Double Headed Shot" and "Dead Men's." 24 Hoole in "Alabama and W.

      <field name="heading_text">Scribal Errors and Textual Integrity: The Case of Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960 by Stephen K. Wright</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few manuscripts can claim to hold as much interest for students of early German religious drama as Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960, the so-called "Innsbrucker Spielhandschrift." 1 The manuscript, which consists of sixty undecorated paper leaves filled with narrowly spaced verse, is essentially the work of a single scribe known to us only as "Johannes," who according to his own testimony copied out the entire book during a period of about two weeks late in the summer of 1391. 2 Despite its rather unprepossessing appearance, the Innsbruck codex is a rare treasure in that it preserves a complete fourteenth-century playbook containing three highly innovative vernacular dramas: a unique tripartite play depicting the preaching of the Apostles, the Assumption of the Virgin, and the conquest of the Jews (fols. 1r-34v); a justly famous Easter play (fols. 35v-50r); and a spectacular processional play designed for the feast of Corpus Christi (fols. 51r-59r). The manuscript is all the more remarkable for two other reasons. In the first place, each of the plays in the book is the earliest extant complete work of its kind. 3 Secondly, each play manifests such theatrical, musical, and literary sophistication as to deserve extensive critical attention in its own right. Indeed, a recent bibliography of studies devoted to the three plays in Innsbruck Cod. 960 runs to more than two hundred and thirty items. 4 Despite a healthy tradition of scholarly interest in its contents, however, Walter Neuhauser's introduction to the facsimile edition of the manuscript remains one of the very few paleographical or codicological analyses of the book itself. The purpose of the present study, then, is to enlarge upon Neuhauser's meticulous description of Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960 by showing that the physical condition of the manuscript still has a great deal to tell us about the history of the three plays and their association with one another, about the way medieval readers responded to the allegedly disordered or fragmentary state of the plays, and about the process which may have brought the texts from their native Thuringia to their final home in the Tirol sometime between 1391 and 1445.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Since much of what is to follow concerns the nature of the lost source from which Johannes was working, it is necessary to begin this study with a brief review of what is already known about the composition and transmission of the plays in Innsbruck Cod. 960. To begin with, the confusion surrounding the provenance of the plays is reflected in the long-standing uncertainty as to what they should properly be called. In the past, the plays have commonly been referred to either as the Innsbrucker Spiele or the Neustifter Spiele . Both terms are misleading. The only connection that the plays have with Innsbruck is the fact that the manuscript in which they are preserved was transferred to the university library sometime between 1809, when the monastery which had once housed it was dissolved, and 1840, when Franz Joseph Mone discovered it as an uncatalogued item in the university collection. 5 The second designation has a somewhat better claim to accuracy. It is evident that by 1445 the manuscript had come into the possession of the Augustinians at Neustift bei Brixen, since fol. 60v contains a note in the hand of "Scribe C" describing the burial of Oswald von Wolkenstein at the writer's own monastery. 6 Nevertheless, for reasons which will be explained below, it is highly unlikely that the plays were copied down in their present form at Neustift, although there is some evidence to indicate that they may well have been performed there at a later date. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessary confusion in discussions of the plays' provenance and influence, it seems best simply to refer to them by the titles which Johannes himself used in 1391: Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis ; Ludus de resurrectione domini ; and Ludus de corpore Christi . 7 Johannes' dated explicit establishes that the Innsbruck codex was completed on September 5, 1391, and the obituary added by Scribe C confirms that the book had come to Neustift by August, 1445. But where and when were the plays actually composed? Dialectical peculiarities shared by the Easter play and the Assumption play indicate that the original home of both works is to be sought in the Henneberg region of western Thuringia, probably in the prosperous mining town of Schmalkalden. 8 In this regard, it is worth noting that according to the Heiksche Chronik , Schmalkalden boasted a rich dramatic heritage which included not only plays on Biblical subjects, but also dramatizations of the destruction of Jerusalem, that is to say, plays similar to the final episode of the Ludus de assumptione . 9 One cannot pinpoint the provenance of the Corpus Christi play with the same degree of accuracy, but dialectical evidence demonstrates that it too was composed in Thuringia, probably somewhat to the east of Schmalkalden. 10 Although it is difficult to assign a precise date to the plays, it is generally agreed that all three predate the manuscript by at least fifty years. Topical allusions to papal and imperial politics place the date of the Easter play between 1323 and 1347. 11 The Assumption play, which may be slightly older than the Easter play, also dates from the second quarter of the fourteenth century, while the Corpus Christi play may have been composed as early as 1314-1320. 12 There can be little doubt that the plays were intended for performance. The narrow half-folio format of the leaves, the rough manner in which the book has been handled, and the presence of red marginalia and underlining to indicate role assignments and stage directions all suggest that the manuscript may have been used as a director's script sometime after 1391. 13 But were the plays actually staged at Neustift? Until recently, it was simply taken for granted that the manuscript was the work of one of the brothers at Neustift and that the plays must have been performed within the walls of the monastery itself. However, the only tangible evidence connecting any of the three plays with the monastery is a late note in the hand of Scribe C (fol. 50v), which recommends the Corpus Christi play for performance and suggests when and by whom it should be staged: "Incipit ludus utilis pro devocione simplicium intimandus et peragendus die corporis Christi vel infra octavas de fide katholica. Sumentur persone litterate et apte et sic de aliis." A second argument for performance at Neustift can be made on the grounds of the commonsense supposition that the monks of that house would not have bothered to acquire and preserve such a copious playbook out of sheer antiquarian curiosity, but rather must have intended to use it at least as a model for theatrical productions of their own. Finally, the play with which the manuscript begins, the Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis , seems to be particularly appropriate for performance at Neustift. The central action of the play, the death and assumption of the Virgin, preserves much of the formality and musical complexity of the liturgical observances upon which it is based. What is more, the church at Neustift annually commemorated the dedication of its sanctuary on August 15, the feast of the Assumption. 14 Nevertheless, recent studies have cautioned against the facile acceptance of the notion that all three plays were performed at Neustift around 1391, and that the monastery thus represents the source of the great flowering of Tirolian drama in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 15 With the possible exception of a Latin Visitatio Sepulchri (Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek MS. 610, fols. 182v-183r) which has tentatively been associated with the monastery, 16 an intensive search has failed to uncover any evidence proving that religious dramas were ever staged at Neustift, much less a vernacular play of the magnitude of the Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis , a 3200-line music drama which required a cast of nearly fifty well-schooled performers and took no less than two days to perform. 17 Even if Innsbruck Cod. 960 were in Neustift in 1445, the further hypothesis that the scribe who copied the plays from a Thuringian source more than half a century earlier was also a brother of the same house is, as Barbara Thoran has emphasized, "kühn und gänzlich unbewiesen" (p. 361). Indeed, since the extant texts show no signs of Tirolian dialectical influence, one ought rather to assume that the manuscript did not arrive in Neustift until after 1391. 18 Hans Moser (pp. 183-184) argues that the finished playbook was probably obtained by the Augustinians at Neustift much closer to 1445 than to the actual date of its production in 1391, and that it therefore came to the region far too late to affect the local dramatic traditions which were already well established in Hall, Sterzing, and other neighboring towns. Likewise, neither Thoran (pp. 362-377) nor Moser (pp. 180-183) is able to detect any definite traces of the 1391 text of the Ludus de resurrectione domini in later versions of the Tiroler Passionsspiel , thus refuting the widely held notion that performances at Neustift profoundly influenced the development of the Tirolian dramatic tradition. If the plays were staged at Neustift at all, Moser (pp. 184-186) suggests that the extant manuscript would have been used only as a model from which revised acting scripts would have been rewritten in a more familiar dialectical form. For these reasons, it seems best to think about all three plays in terms of their original home in early fourteenth-century Thuringia, rather than as examples of fifteenth-century Tirolian monastic drama. Accordingly, the task of the present study is to consider the technique and work habits of the scribe Johannes in order to learn as much as possible about the history of the plays before their inclusion in the extant Innsbruck codex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In the explicit to the Ludus de resurrectione domini (fol. 50r), Johannes tells us that he finished copying that particular play on "sexta feria in die Egidij" (Friday, September 1) in the year 1391, only five working days after he had completed the Assumption play on the Saturday after St. Bartholomew's day, that is to say on August 26. Since he was apparently working at a steady pace of about five to six pages a day, it is tempting to guess that Johannes was just beginning his second day's work on the Easter play when, at the top of a fresh page (fol. 38r), he made the only serious blunders in an otherwise carefully executed piece. 19 After having lost his place in his source, Johannes twice began to insert speeches from the preceding Assumption play into the Ludus de resurrectione domini . He quickly caught each mistake in turn, deleted the offending passages, and continued on with the appropriate lines from the Easter play. Apart from being mere paleographical curiosities, these scribal errors are worthy of our attention because of what they have to tell us about the lives of both of the plays in question prior to their inclusion in Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960. Even more importantly, the botched work on fol. 38r can shed some light on the vexed question of the completeness and performability of the Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis , and can also help establish the correct sequence of several crucial episodes in the Ludus de resurrectione domini . It is necessary to begin by describing the errors themselves in some detail. After having transcribed the first 194 lines of the Easter play without mishap during what was probably a single session, Johannes left off work at the bottom of fol. 37v. As is often the case, the end of the page did not exactly correspond with the completion of the speech in question. Consequently, fol. 37v breaks off abruptly in the middle of an apology by "Quartus Miles," one of Pilate's hapless guards who has just been awakened beside the empty tomb by the fulminations of the Roman procurator himself: Ach czetar und waffen! hy e ist czu e lange geschlaffen, uns ist gestolen der lichnam . . . (ll. 192-194) At the top of the facing page, however, Johannes began not with the continuation of the same speech, but with lines 2864-72 of the Assumption play which he had finished copying only a few days before. As soon as he recognized his mistake, Johannes underlined the erroneous insertion as a conventional sign of deletion and promptly returned to his task. Unfortunately, he again failed to find the correct place in the speech of the fourth knight, but copied instead lines 2906-25 from the same Assumption play. Perhaps more out of sheer frustration than out of any attempt to re-establish clarity for his readers, Johannes crossed out all twenty-seven lines with hasty diagonal slash marks, scribbled the warning "non pertinet" in the upper margin, left the bottom third of the ruined page blank, and began anew with the correct speech from the Easter play at the top of fol. 38v. The reasons for these unusual errata are not difficult to explain. As has already been noted, the three dated explicits in Innsbruck Cod. 960 confirm that the scribe was copying difficult and perhaps unfamiliar material at a rather rapid pace. In his haste, it appears that Johannes was misled by a number of superficial similarities between the interrupted speech of Quartus Miles in the Easter play and the two passages which he inadvertently cited from the Ludus de assumptione . Both passages are taken from an elaborate initiation ceremony during which a recently converted king institutes a new order of Christian chivalry. Specifically, lines 2864-72 of the Assumption play are part of the obedient reply of a certain "Tertius Miles" to his sovereign, while lines 2906-25 come from a dialogue between the king and "Secundus Miles." The close resemblance of the speakers' names ("Quartus Miles" in the Easter play, "Tertius Miles" and "Secundus Miles" in the Assumption play) and the similar dramatic contexts of all three of the speeches in question (a dialogue between a ruler and his knights) temporarily blinded Johannes to the fact that he had begun copying at the wrong place. His confusion was perhaps compounded by the close proximity of the two speeches from the Assumption play and by the possibility that both speeches stood at the top of their respective pages. It cannot be known, of course, how closely Johannes was following the original line divisions of his source, but in their existing form lines 2864-72 are found at the very top of fol. 31v, while lines 2906-25 are the first lines on the facing page, fol. 32r. Beyond giving us a vivid momentary glimpse into the scriptorium of a conscientious but apparently overtaxed medieval copyist, the errors on fol. 38r are important because of what they can tell us about the lost source from which Johannes was working. Clearly, Johannes could not have made mistakes of this nature if he had been copying the text from a manuscript which contained only the famous Easter play. Nor could he have copied the two incorrect speeches from his own transcription of the first play in Innsbruck Cod. 960, since this would require us to imagine the absurd scene of a scribe so befuddled as to miscopy a text by repeatedly paging back and forth between fols. 31v and 32r of his recently completed Assumption play and fol. 38r of the still unfinished Easter play in the same manuscript. It is, of course, barely possible that Johannes copied the speeches from the wrong playbook altogether, if one assumes that he was so negligent as to go back to the book containing the Assumption play, which he had already finished and laid aside on August 26, rather than resume copying from the manuscript of the Easter play which he had handled only the day before. It is far more reasonable, however, to suppose that Johannes began his day's work by mistakenly turning to the wrong page of the same book which he had been using for more than a week. By the process of elimination, then, we are left with what is by far the simplest and most plausible explanation, namely, that Johannes was not working from a set of separate codices containing a single play each, but from a small collection of plays, a lost fourteenth-century Thuringian anthology which must have included at least the first two works in the Innsbruck manuscript and probably the Ludus de corpore Christi as well. The argument that Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960 represents a copy of an earlier, non-extant collection of Thuringian dramas has several important corollaries for the textual history of the three plays. In the first place, the nature of the errors described above rules out the possibility that Johannes himself may have been the author, redactor, or even the first anthologizer of the plays. Only a copyist working quickly, mechanically, and somewhat too inattentively could have transposed two fragmentary speeches from one play to another with so little regard for the grammatical correctness or logical continuity of what he was writing. Furthermore, the mistakes on fol. 38r demonstrate that whether or not Johannes was ever a brother at Neustift bei Brixen, the lost anthology which served as his source certainly could not have been either a product or a permanent possession of that house. It is difficult to imagine a set of circumstances which would cause the small group of Augustinians at Neustift to make an identical copy of a lengthy collection of plays already in their own library without first bothering to alter at least some of the unfamiliar Thuringian dialectical forms into the more readily comprehensible speech of their own region. One can only conclude that like its lost precursor, the anthology preserved in Innsbruck Cod. 960 was copied in or around Schmalkalden before making its way to its final home in the Tirol. Given that the extant Innsbruck codex is based on a lost anthology, one can also safely infer at least one other prior stage in the textual history of the three works when archetypal versions of each play existed as independent documents. As has already been mentioned above, the home of both the Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis and the Ludus de resurrectione domini is to be sought in the Henneberg region of western Thuringia, whereas the Ludus de corpore Christi must have been composed in eastern Thuringia in the first half of the fourteenth century. The provenance and transmission history of the three texts can thus be described by a simple stemma. In the following diagram, α, β, and γ represent the archetypes of the Assumption play, the Easter play, and the Corpus Christi play, δ is a hypothetical intermediary collection consisting only of the two western Thuringian plays, and ε is the lost three-play anthology used by Johannes as the source for the Innsbruck manuscript: What we know about Johannes' lost source has important implications for readers of the Ludus de assumptione beatae Mariae virginis , a complex and fascinating music drama in its own right. As was noted above, the play concludes with the representation of a pitched battle between armies of Christians and Jews, an episode based loosely on the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian in 70 A.D. 20 The Christian warriors are initially driven back by the defenders of the castrum Judaeorum , but their king rallies them to a counterattack with a rousing battle cry: Ir stolczen ritter wol gemut, stellet uch czu e were, daz duncket mich gut. und wendet uch kegen den Juden alle, dy e czyen uns noch mit yrem schalle, sy e wullen uns vahen und wyczin; nu e schicket daz baner an dy e spiczen, und ryt wir sy e an, ir ritter czart, ez taug uns lenger nicht gespart. (ll. 3161-68) At this point the play suddenly ends. The conclusion of the battle scene seems so abrupt that some readers have argued that the text preserved in Innsbruck Cod. 960 is in fact a fragment which lacks the anticipated ultimate Christian victory over the Jews. David Brett-Evans, a surprisingly unsympathetic student of the play, has gone so far as to suggest that Johannes omitted the closing lines of the work out of sheer boredom: "Damit läβt der Verfasser die Belagerung von Jerusalem beginnen, aber gerade an dieser Stelle bricht der Text mit einem lakonischen et cetera, explicit ludus de assumptione ab. Man kann sich freilich des Eindrucks nicht ganz erwehren, daβ der Kopist eher das Interesse an seiner Aufgabe verloren hatte, als daβ ihm die fehlenden Verse nicht vorlagen" (II, 25-26). Needless to say, there is absolutely no evidence to warrant such a disparaging pronouncement. On the contrary, Johannes assures us in the explicit that the Ludus de assumptione "est completum." His use of the phrase "et cetera" after the king's last speech merely implies that the final assault upon the Jews is meant to be portrayed by means of mimed stage business, with the specific manner of the performance being left to the discretion of each subsequent producer of the play. Brett-Evans neglects to mention that the playwright (or his copyist) uses the phrase in exactly the same manner at the end of the Ludus de resurrectione as well (fol. 50r), a play whose completeness and performability have never been called into question. In the context of the present study, it is worth emphasizing that what we know about the relationship between Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960 and its lost source also suggests that the Assumption play should be read as a complete work as it now stands. The errors on fol. 38r demonstrate that Johannes did not copy the play from a defective manuscript which lacked the final pages of the text, but rather from an anthology nearly identical in appearance to the surviving Innsbruck playbook. This means that the version of the Ludus de assumptione in the lost ε-manuscript must have contained the same abrupt conclusion ridiculed by Brett-Evans, namely, the spectacular battle scene outside the walls of Jerusalem. It follows, then, that at least two dependable fourteenth-century readers—the scribe Johannes and the unknown redactor of the lost Thuringian anthology—both perceived the extant version of the play to be a coherent, finished text, comprehensible and playable exactly as it has come down to us. Since neither Johannes, nor his precursor, nor any of the later users of the manuscript seem to have doubted the structural or thematic integrity of the work, modern readers might be well advised to consider the Assumption play in terms of its own carefully plotted musical and dramatic symmetries before dismissing it out of hand as a tedious and hopelessly truncated fragment. Evidence from fol. 38r of the Innsbruck playbook can also help us ascertain the proper sequence of several episodes in the Ludus de resurrectione . In the manuscript itself, the dramatization of the Harrowing of Hell culminates with a typical piece of social satire in which the demons repopulate their recently invaded domain with the souls of recognizable scoundrels from all walks of medieval urban life. This satirical interlude concludes with a long lament by Lucifer, who adopts the unlikely role of a preacher in order to warn the audience against the dangers of the sin of pride (ll. 406-21; fol. 41r). In his 1937 edition of the Easter play, Eduard Hartl transferred Lucifer's poignant monologue from the end of the satire to its beginning, immediately after the procession of the redeemed souls into paradise, on the grounds that "nur an dieser Stelle findet die Klage ihre innere Berechtigung: Lucifer, der seit seinem Sturz nur das Böse sah und das Böse übte, sieht jetzt auf einmal wieder die ganze Reinheit und Herrlichkeit des Himmels vor sich, es überkommt ihn wehmütige Erinnerung an sein einstiges Leben, in dem auch er ein strahlender Engel war, und nun befällt ihn tiefe Reue" (p. 124). Hartl justifies his radical departure from the testimony of the manuscript on the grounds of supposed theatrical effectiveness, claiming that his reconstruction would generate a more highly charged emotional response in medieval and modern audiences alike. 21 Unfortunately, this subjective and wholly arbitrary approach to the text is uncritically adopted by Rudolf Meier, who reprints Hartl's drastic rearrangement without comment in what is now the most widely available edition of the play. 22 The only manuscript evidence Hartl can present in support of his revision is his interpretation of a phrase found among the otherwise indecipherable pen strokes and random scribblings which fill the lower third of fol. 38r, the portion of the page left blank by Johannes after he crossed out his two erroneous insertions. Hartl (p. 125) notes that the following lines appear near the bottom of the page: "Awe awe hoffart daz din ie erdacht wart / Dar umb wart ich vorstosen." 23 Hartl identifies these lines as the opening verses of Lucifer's monologue, and then contends that their inclusion at this point in the manuscript proves that Lucifer's entire speech on fol. 41r requires editorial repositioning: Wenn also der Schreiber nach dem Vers 241 [Mone, l. 194] andere Verse, die in der Handschrift viel später kommen sollen, hier als Federproben niederschreibt, so kann man wohl daraus schlieβen, daβ die (losen!) Blätter der Vorlage nicht in der richtigen Reihenfolge geordnet waren, wie sich dies aus der nochmaligen Niederschrift der nicht hierher gehörenden Szene aus der Himmelfahrt ergibt. Wie weit nun die Unordnung in der Vorlage gegangen ist, kann man kaum mehr nachprüfen, doch jedenfalls steht das eine fest, daβ das Bl. 38r noch von dieser Unordnung Kenntnis gibt. (p. 125) As we have already seen, however, the reasons for the presence of the two speeches from the Assumption play have nothing whatsoever to do with misordered sequences of scenes in the plays themselves, much less with what Hartl imagines to have been the haphazard looseleaf state of Johannes' source manuscript. The errors on fol. 38r testify to the fact that a confused scribe twice turned to the wrong page in his source; they do not indicate that the pages in that source were themselves in a state of confusion. What is more, Hartl seriously misconstrues the significance of the verses which he cites. Although the lines clearly echo Lucifer's autobiographical monologue, there are glaring discrepancies between the two passages in terms of orthography, morphology, syntax, and sheer content. One need only compare the italicized lines in Lucifer's actual speech in the Easter play with the lines from fol. 38r cited above in order to appreciate the striking differences which Hartl completely disregards: Awe awe hoffart , daz din y e erdacht wart , ich waz eyn engel klar und luchte ubir aller engel schar, ich hatte mich dez vormeβen daz ich welde hochir han geseβen wen der ware got, der da ist der hoste rat; dar czu e brachte mich myn hoffart , daz ich ernyder gestoβen wart vil tyff in dy e helle, ich und alle myn gesellen. (ll. 406-417; fol. 41r) Clearly, the lines on fol. 38r are not an exact transcription from a misordered page in the source manuscript as Hartl contends, but rather an extremely loose paraphrase of Lucifer's lament which has been jotted down in an empty space on a ruined page already half-filled with meaningless penstrokes, a page so disfigured and irrelevant to the text of the play itself as to be an open invitation to the casual graffitist. Indeed, the fragmentary verses on fol. 38r are almost certainly the addition of a later user of the manuscript rather than the work of Johannes himself. The lines are spaced more than twice as far apart as the width uniformly maintained by the scribe throughout the rest of his work, and the first two lines of the inscription are run together without being separated by the clear vertical stroke which Johannes customarily employs to indicate line divisions in the verse. The ink is of a different quality from that used by Johannes and has thus faded noticeably more than the rest of the writing on the page. Finally, the handwriting itself, while closely resembling the cursiva textualis of Johannes, shows features absent from his work, including an idiosyncratic loop above the A , a larger, less sloping, and more fully rounded loop above the b , d , and h , the lack of exaggerated ornamental descenders on the f , h , s , and z , and the use of a final b and an unusual ligature over the word umb. Perhaps the most plausible way to account for the addition of these lines by a later hand is to read them as a humorous commentary on the unsightly appearance of the page itself, an oblique joke at the expense of the unfortunate Johannes. By means of this tongue-in-cheek allusion to Lucifer's lament, the unknown graffitist playfully equates the proud angel's calamitous lapse from grace with the lapsus calami of the inattentive scribe, suggesting that in both cases the parties in question were guilty of spoiling an otherwise perfect creation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III By way of conclusion, it is worth pausing to consider the question of how Johannes' anthology migrated from Thuringia to the Tirol. Walter Senn adopts the romantic but wholly unsubstantiated view that the book was acquired by Oswald von Wolkenstein during his travels, and that the minnesinger bequeathed it to the monks at Neustift when he died in August, 1445. 24 Similarly, Wolfgang Michael, who has long been intrigued by the possible influence of Goliardic verse on the development of German religious drama, speculates that the playbook may have been carried south by wandering scholars. 25 Although it is true that the Ludus de resurrectione concludes with St. John's plea to the audience to donate "braten / schuldern und ouch vladen" to the hungry students in their midst (ll. 1176-77), the three plays are all conceived on such a vast and elaborate scale as to make them totally unsuitable for performance by a small troupe of vagantes . Indeed, Hartl (pp. 130-131) and Neuhauser (p. 5) are correct to point out that a reference to the prayers of "dy pristere und dy schulere alle" in the exhortation by St. John cited above (l. 1183) suggests that the play was staged by a monastic schola cantorum . There is no need to invent such colorful intermediaries as minstrels or vagantes , however, if one accepts the more mundane premise that the Augustinians at Neustift simply acquired the plays from brothers of their own order in Thuringia. During the fourteenth century, the Augustinians enjoyed a period of great expansion throughout central Europe. Even as early as 1300 the order had over forty houses in Germany. It is surely not without significance that two of the oldest and most prominent Augustinian houses were those at Gotha and Schmalkalden, in the very heart of the region which produced not only the three plays in Innsbruck Universitätsbibliothek Cod. 960, but also a number of similar plays now preserved elsewhere. 26 What is more, there is considerable evidence of direct contact between Thuringia and various Tirolian monasteries throughout the period in question. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, for example, numerous clerics from central Germany served as bishops, abbots, and provosts in the Tirol, including such a distinguished figure as Nicholas of Cusa, who was bishop of Brixen from 1450 to 1458. 27 Walter Neuhauser (pp. 13, 18, n. 29 and 30) records the names of several scribes who found their way from central Germany to Tirolian monastic scriptoria, and notes that a certain "Georg, genannt der Heuss" (the Hessian) resided at Neustift in 1384. Taken together, this evidence suggests that although the plays in the Innsbruck codex may not have been originally composed by or for monks, 28 it is quite likely that they were collected in the vicinity of Schmalkalden by Augustinians who eventually carried their small anthology south to their sister house at Neustift bei Brixen. It has recently been argued that because every new performance of a play is tantamount to the creation of a new textual variant, it is unreasonable to criticize editors who propose fanciful, if dramatically effective, emendations of the manuscripts which we have inherited. According to this line of reasoning, it is not the individual extant text, but rather the dramatic tradition itself—a process predicated on constant variation from performance to performance—which is the legitimate object of critical attention: Therefore, even if the same man composed the baker's speech and the speeches of the other tradesmen [in the estates satire of the Easter play], even if he wrote them on the same page, all that is irrelevant. The tradition allows them to be broken up and placed anywhere in the manuscript or in a production of the play where they seem appropriate. . . . Hartl's edition of the Innsbruck Easterplay, then, is not wrong; it is no more than an indication of another potential variation, which Hartl transforms into a real variation by creating a text. . . . 29 Few would argue that later adaptations and performances are unworthy of study in their own right. Nor can it be claimed that codicological evidence alone enables one to make definitive pronouncements about a playwright's intentions or about how a play may have been staged at any given performance. Nevertheless, it remains true that manuscript studies can teach us a great deal about the origin and transmission of medieval plays. 30 Moreover, as this study has attempted to demonstrate, the analysis of scribal errors can be an especially useful test to help us decide whether a copyist was acting as an independent redactor or as a scrupulous transcriber of texts which, to him at least, seemed authoritative, complete, and performable exactly as they had come to his hand. In the present case, the palpable embarrassment of the scribe who crossed out his own errors on fol. 38r, only to be mocked for his carelessness by a later reader, testifies to the fact that the maker of the Innsbruck playbook understood that his task was not to alter or improve his source, but to preserve it. While directors and actors must indeed be free to manipulate texts in order to serve their own theatrical purposes, historians and editors can surely do no less than adhere to the same strict standards of textual fidelity which Johannes and his peers adopted for themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 A facsimile of the manuscript has been published by Eugen Thurnher and Walter Neuhauser, Die Neustifter-Innsbrucker Spielhandschrift von 1391: Cod. 960 der Universitätsbibliothek Innsbruck , Litterae, 40 (Göppingen: A. Kümmerle, 1975). The only complete edition of the plays in the manuscript is that of Franz Joseph Mone, Altteutsche Schauspiele (Quedlinburg and Leipzig: G. Basse, 1841). All future references to the playbook are cited from these sources. 2 The scribe's name appears in his own hand on fol. 59r. Dated explicits at the end of each play (fols. 34v; 50r; 59r) allow us to trace the copyist's progress: "Explicit ludus de assumpcione; est completum anno domini M° CCC° nonogesimo primo sabato die post Bartholomei" [August 26, 1391]; "Explicit ludus de resurreccione domini anno domini M° CCC° nonogesimo primo completus est liber iste sexta feria in die Egidij" [September 1, 1391]; "Explicit lyber de corpore Christi anno domini M° CCC° nonogesimo primo tertia die ante nativitatis Marie virginis" [September 5, 1391]. Two other hands have made marginal notes in the manuscript. Sometime after 1391, Scribe B added a 56-line compendium of Latin incantations and formulas for exorcism (fols. 59v-60r). In 1445, Scribe C added an obituary notice on the death of Oswald von Wolkenstein (fol. 60v) and comments on the performance of the Corpus Christi play (fols. 50v and 51v). See Thurnher and Neuhauser, pp. 11, 14-17. 3 The only German Assumption play to predate the one in the Innsbruck codex is the so-called Amorbacher Marienhimmelfahrtspiel , a garbled fragment of less than 150 lines dating from the early fourteenth century; see Rudolf Heym, "Bruchstück eines geistlichen Schauspiels von Marien Himmelfahrt," Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur , 52 (1910), 1-56. The only earlier surviving Easter play is a 612-line fragment dating from about 1250; see Friedrich Ranke, Das Osterspiel von Muri: Faksimiledruck der Fragmente und Rekonstruktion der Pergamentrolle (Basel: Alkuin, 1967). The so-called "Innicher Osterspielfragment," a 9-line fragment which may be part of a lost Easter play, dates from 1340; see Wolfgang Michael, "Zum Innicher Osterspielfragment von 1340," Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie , 87 (1968), 387-390, and Ursula Hennig, "Zu dem sogenannten Osterspiel-Fragment von Innichen," Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur , 101 (1972), 358-368. No earlier Corpus Christi play or fragment survives in any language. 4 Thurnher and Neuhauser, pp. 20-28. The overwhelming majority of these studies are devoted to the Easter play. 5 For the history of the manuscript, see Barbara Thoran, "Das Osterspiel der Innsbrucker Handschrift Cod. 960: Ein Neustifter Osterspiel?" in Tiroler Volksschauspiel: Beiträge zur Theatergeschichte des Alpenraumes , ed.

Dane, "MS, Text, Allusion: The Critical Description of Medieval Drama with Particular Reference to the Innsbruck Easterplay (1391)," Germanic Review , 57 (1982), pp. 159-161, is alone in supporting Hartl's free-handed reordering of the manuscript on the grounds that the medieval playbook does not deserve to be considered a definitive text, but rather must be regarded as "a free variation of certain generic material, and thus less a text than an allusion to what has been or what might be staged within a particular dramatic tradition." Dane's misunderstanding of the erroneous citations from the Assumption play is nowhere more apparent than when he interprets the scribbling on fol. 38r as the scribe's conscious effort to create a legitimate "variation" of his inherited material (p. 161). 22 Rudolf Meier, ed., Das Innsbrucker Osterspiel; Das Osterspiel von Muri (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1962). Despite their widely acknowledged importance in the history of early German religious drama, there is still no satisfactory modern edition of any of the three plays in the Innsbruck manuscript. 23 The present transcription, which differs slightly from Hartl's emended version, has been checked against the manuscript for accuracy. 24 Walter Senn, "Wo starb Oswald von Wolkenstein?"

      <field name="heading_text">The STCN Fingerprint by P. C. A. Vriesema *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The STCN, The Short-Title Catalogue, Netherlands, is the national retrospective bibliography for the period 1540-1800 in the area now called the Netherlands. 1 One of the difficulties facing cataloguers in such an enterprise is how to discriminate between line-for-line reprints that look identical and how to avoid mistaking them for copies of the same edition if the copies are spread over more than one library. But we also have to know how to discover whether a given copy is a reissue of a particular edition with a cancellans title-page suggesting a different edition or else an authentic reset new edition. After all, the information given on the title-page may suggest a separate, different edition, not a reissue. For a catalogue in which the entries are to be for individual editions and issues these are very real problems. The need has long been felt for a reliable and economical method of identifying different editions. The fingerprint is such a method. It is a formula which indicates some particular exclusive features of a piece of printed matter and hence of a particular edition. After Madan's invention of two identification tests at about the turn of the century 2 the formula developed in two directions in the seventies. The principle in either case is that a reprint, even if at first sight it appears identical, is never exactly the same as its example. One method was developed by J. W. Jolliffe et al. for the LOC project. 3 Jolliffe started from the differences that might occur at the ends of lines at particular places. His method, the details of which were worked out by an Anglo-French working group, is set out in a manual 4 which is now used in many libraries in Britain, France and Italy. The second method starts from the position of the signature relative to the text in the bottom line of specified leaves. It is not infrequently described in the literature and is recommended by Foxon, Laufer and Gaskell. Foxon used it in his English Verse 1701-1750 and it is demonstrated by Todd in his article on The Gentleman's Magazine . 5 Up to that time no rules for using the method had been available. In about 1971 the method was introduced to the Netherlands by Prof. J. Gerritsen for use on the STCN, and rules were drawn up by a working group. 6 Because the fingerprint has been designed specifically for books printed with movable types before 1800 the method cannot be used with books containing little or no typographic text, such as books of plates, atlases and music books. With computerization in mind, Prof. Gerritsen's fingerprint was revised by the editors of the STCN in 1982. The result is the version presented here. The software to enable the computer to bring together wholly or partially identical fingerprints is currently being developed. In the meantime, and very successfully, identification of typesetting is being done 'by hand'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Example of 'Discriminating' and 'Matching' The STCN fingerprint consists of a signature and the text appearing immediately above it and wholly within its width. Letters of which only a part falls within these limits are ignored. The signatures used are the first and last of separately signed preliminary, principal and postliminary matter (in so far as this is present). The formula consists of: year and format of the book, an indicator , the signature and the text above it, and punctuation between these components. For example: Barlaeus, Caspar. Orationvm liber. By C. Barlaeus . Amstelaedami, ap. J. Blaev, 1661. 12 : * 12 A-X 12 Y 6 . H has the fingerprint: One of the chief advantages of the STCN fingerprint in its present revised form is that it enables computer discrimination between editions even where the copies concerned are line-for-line reprints. Five editions of Vondel's Palamedes are known with the imprint: Amsterdam, A. de Wees, 1652. The title-pages all have the same text in the same typography, 7 and the books have the same collational formula and format. That is, the books are line-for-line reprints. How do we determine to which edition a particular copy belongs? The standard descriptions would be identical. The fingerprint is an economical and reliable tool to enable the cataloguer to solve this problem. Unger's Vondel bibliography also distinguishes between these editions. 8 He usually gives a number of textual variants to discriminate between copies. However, his system is not watertight because he can make distinctions only when a second copy has already been identified as belonging to a different edition. The STCN fingerprint provides positive identification of every copy and can therefore be used for discrimination purposes from the first copy described onwards. The STCN entry for all these copies would be: Vondel, Joost van den. Palamedes of Vermoorde onnozelheit. By J. v. Vondel . Amsterdam, f . A. de Wees, 1652. 4 : A-K 4 L 2 . However, calling up the description on the terminal at once reveals the differences in fingerprints: Unger 121: 165204 - b1 A2 en$b : b2 L uw Unger 122: 165204 - b1 A2 de$e : b2 L we Unger 123: 165204 - b1 A2 ade$e : b2 L e Unger 124: 165204 - b1 A2 ade : b2 L we Unger 125: 165204 - b1 A2 ade$ : b2 L $w An overview of the relevant signatures and bottom lines appears in the Appendix. To enable the user of the catalogue to compare any copy with the STCN entry to establish its identity, each entry has an additional note giving a textual variant peculiar to that edition. Matching , i.e. bringing together copies appearing superficially to represent other different editions, or even different texts, can be most easily accomplished by getting the computer to gather together all the identical fingerprints in a catalogue. This is something that can always be done, regardless of where the copies themselves are kept. Under shelf-mark 447 G 65 the Royal Library in The Hague 9 has Buysero, Dirck. Korte beschrijvinge van Parys. [ By Dirck Buysero ]. Vlissinghe, pr. A. van Laren, [3rd quarter 17th cent.].4 : A-K 4 L 2 . H The fingerprint is: 000004 - b1 A2 ant$ : b2 L r Under shelf-mark 760 E 24 the same library also has: Leven. Het leven en bedrijf der monsieurs en juffers in Vrankryk. Vlissingen, A. Schot bsr , 1676. 4 : A-K 4 L 2 . H In this case the fingerprint is: 167604 - b1 A2 ant$ : b2 L r Such a fingerprint is a signal that one of the two is a reissue. The chance of two copies really having nothing to do with each other and yet having the same fingerprint must be regarded as so minute as to be negligible. A useful first check, since in such cases the dates will naturally differ, is a comparison of the collational formulas. Here they are identical. The decisive factor is that the main part of the fingerprint is identical. The laws of probability together with empirical observation indicate that where two entries contain not only the same fingerprint but also the same collational formulas and formats, one of them is certain to be a reissue. In the case of this particular text, of course, identification means that Het leven en bedrijf der monsieurs may now be attributed to Buysero. The entry in the STCN then becomes: Buysero, Dirck. Korte beschrijvinge van Parys. [ By Dirck Buysero ]. Vlissinghe, pr. A. van Laren, [3rd quarter 17th cent.]. 4 : A-K 4 L 2 . H ___. [ Reissue ]. Het leven en bedrijf der monsieurs en juffers in Vrankryk. [ By Dirck Buysero ]. Vlissingen, A. Schot bsr , 1676. 4 : A-K 4 L 2 . H</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rules for Using the STCN Fingerprint 0 Introduction 0.1 In the case of works consisting of more than one volume a separate fingerprint is made for each volume. 0.2 The fingerprint is based on the ideal copy of the book. Any errors in binding or imposition are ignored and tacitly corrected. 0.3 Each fingerprint is composed of the following elements: 1 date/format (see §1); 2 the indicators (see §2); 3 the signatures (see §3); 4 the text above the signatures (see §4); 5 Punctuation (see §5). 1 Date and format 1.1 The year , transcribed into arabic numerals but not converted to the Christian era from the Jewish etc., and without correction of printing errors, is given as it appears in the imprint on the title-page: e.g. 1692, M.D.Lij = 1552, An 7 = 0007. 1.2 If no explicit year of publication appears in the imprint, the date is given as 0000. Dates taken from copy imprints etc. are used, however. 1.3 Printing errors in roman etc. numerals which result in a non-existent date (e.g. M.D.Mij) are replaced by 0000. 1.4 The format is given as 02, 04, 08, 12 etc.; oblong is not indicated. If the format cannot be determined with certainty it is shown as 00. 2 Indicators 2.1 The signatures selected are named as follows: 1. Preliminary matter, first/last: a1, a2; 2. Main text, " " b1, b2; 3. Postliminary matter " " c1, c2. 2.2 Any subdivisions within a work which are marked by a new series of signatures are mentioned separately in the fingerprint. The indicator is then given a serial number. For example: a collational formula A-2B 4 , 2 A-P 4 may refer to a work whose fingerprint is: 1b1 A2 aa : 1b2 2B3 bb - 2b1 A cc : 2b2 P3 dd 2.3 Positions that do not occur are not indicated as such. If the first and last positions coincide they are shown as b1=b2. 3 Signatures 3.1 The signatures are given in simplified form, e.g. AAA iij becomes 3A3. 3.2 If more than one signature appears on a page, the bottom one, or the one nearest the right, is used. 3.3 Selection . The signatures used are the first and last in every primary or secondary bibliographical (not textual) unit, i.e.: 3.4 Preliminary matter if and in so far as it has a separate sequence of signatures. It is regarded as a single whole even if illogically or arbitrarily signed. The procedure is repeated if more than one subseries in the signatures coincide with clear subdivisions of the preliminary matter (e.g. * -3 * and a-d, preface and index respectively). 3.5 Text (in the bibliographical sense, i.e. including preliminary and postliminary matter if not separately signed). The text is regarded as a single unit if one or more alphabets are used in regular succession for the signatures (even if interrupted by, for example, a title and preliminary matter for a second part: of A-2C, *, 2D-3P only A and 3P). The procedure is repeated if a new subdivision of the text begins with a new alphabet ( 2 A, a, 2A, etc., even if the previous one happens to have ended in Z), or if a new subdivision starts in the middle of a gathering but still begins using a new alphabet for the signature from that point on. Even a collational formula such as A-5D 4 a-g 4 5E-7F 4 counts as three elements. 3.6 Postliminary matter , if and in so far as it is separately signed. For the rest as 3.4. 3.7 In the case of works consisting of more than one volume a new fingerprint is made for every volume. Each fingerprint is then preceded by the volume number and a mark which the computer can recognize (here: £), e.g. 1£166112 - etc. 3.8 If the last line ends at a point to the left of the end of the signature of the gathering, i.e. directly above it, that signature is not used; if the last line ends to the left of the beginning of the signature, then the line above that is used. 3.9 If a book (or the main text in it) is entirely without signatures, or if none of its signatures can be used (in accordance with §3.11), then a note is made of the piece of text, on a number of pages, of the second line from the bottom falling above the third word of the bottom line (or the third and the second from the bottom if the bottom line is shorter than three words). The pages chosen are the first and last printed rectos of each textual and at the same time bibliographical subdivision of the book: if the collational formula is [A]-[F] 4 the pages chosen are A2 and A4, B1 and E4, F1 and F4 if, say, prelims, main text and index begin on A1, B1 and F1 respectively; if text and index start in the middle of a gathering, only A2 and F4 are taken (A2 and not A1 because not the title-page but the page after it is used). The rest of the procedure is as usual, i.e. the third word of the bottom line is treated as if it were the signature of the gathering. If a main text occurs without signatures while the preliminary and postliminary matter are signed, then the usual rules apply to the preliminary and postliminary matter. 3.10 If the above procedure cannot be carried out (e.g. in the case of atlases, books of plates, sheet music, tables and diagrams), no fingerprint is made except for year and format. 3.11 If a signature cannot be used , the following respectively previous one is used. A signature is unusable if: 1. the bottom of it is more than 25 mm from the bottom of the bottom line of text, or if there is no text above it at all; 2. it occurs below an illustration, graph, table, musical passage, map, etc., i.e. not below a bottom line of text; 3. the symbols referred to are not in a Roman or Greek alphabet (e.g. Arabic, Cyrillic etc.). 3.12 Sometimes it will be useful or necessary to use a signature that would ordinarily be unusuable, e.g. if it is the only one, or the only remotely usable one in that section of the book. 3.13 If a signature is used that is 'wrong' according to 3.11-12 this is indicated with an asterisk (*) before the indicator: * b2 etc. 3.14 By signature is meant the entire signature, i.e. including surrounding brackets, points, ornaments etc. 4 Text 4.1 The piece of text appearing above the prescribed signature is recorded, i.e. those characters that fall wholly or virtually wholly within the prescribed limits. ('Virtually wholly' means: where it is impossible to decide whether the character does or does not fall wholly within the limit.) Characters which only partly fall within the limit are disregarded. If a signature falls under only a part of one character or under parts of two successive characters, these parts count as whole characters: M = M , MA = MA , nu w el = nu w el. 4.2 By characters is meant: typographical units such as letters, numerals, diacritical or punctuation marks, symbols etc. A space, regardless of length, counts as one character and is represented as a $. The characters are transcribed in accordance with the relevant rules. 4.3 Contractions and the ligatures Æ/æ, Œ/œ &amp; and β, whether or not they are taken over into the fingerprint, (like &amp;) or written out in full (like β = ss) are treated as a single character. Other ligatures are regarded as more than one character: ffi etc. 4.4 In Greek every ligature is treated as a single character, though transcribed as if expanded: (A|ὐ|χ ε|ῖ|ζ| |εἶναι| |τό|δε| |τοὖ|œ|γο|ν| |ἐ|μό|ν|) is nineteen characters (spaces included). 4.5 Other alphabets (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic) can also be processed using transcriptions. If this is out of the question because of staffing problems the best solution is to take the following or previous leaf. If it is still impossible to find a suitable leaf, a fingerprint will have to be dispensed with. (What is left over: date/format - ) 5 Punctuation (optional) 5.1 This punctuation is designed first and foremost for our computer program. Other users may use it as they wish. 5.2 The fingerprint is punctuated as follows: Between date/format, preliminary group(s), main group(s) and postliminary group(s): space, hyphen, space ( - ). Between the first and last notation within a group: space, colon, space ( : ). At the end, no closing point.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Booklets in Medieval Manuscripts: Further Considerations by Ralph Hanna III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the most important recent contributions to codicology, the descriptive bibliography of manuscript books, has been the identification and discussion of a unit called the "booklet" or "fascicle." This unit, associated particularly with the work of P. R. Robinson, 1 may be described as a group of leaves forming at least one quire, but more likely several, and presenting a self-contained group of texts. Booklets thus form units intermediate in extent between the quire and the full codex. In Robinson's handling, the booklet has proven a powerful analytical tool; I offer the following qualifications and extensions of her views in an effort at achieving an instrument at once more precise and flexible. An initial problem has been created by Robinson's attempt, perfectly comprehensible in her effort to elaborate her findings, to show booklets in a variety of manuscript contexts. However, this extension of the concept has sometimes, I think, obscured important distinctions. Robinson, especially in her important contribution to Codicologica , conflates different bibliographical situations as if they reflected the same forms of fascicular production. Two major classes of booklet manuscripts, one of these divisible into two subclasses, should, I think, be distinguished. One can consider booklets from two perspectives—that of the vendor or owner of books and that of the producer of books. 2 From the first perspective, a booklet basically exists as an object found at a stationer's or a bookseller's; it presents a desired text, and can be purchased, perhaps to be joined with other texts in a "composite manuscript." Here one would, I think, want to consider two possible subclasses distinguished on a basis purely historical. On the one hand, some such "composite manuscripts" have been joined together by private citizens, rather than persons involved in book-production, during the Middle Ages; others, in contrast, might be considered binding accidents, collections acquired after the Middle Ages and bound together for reasons of convenience alone. 3 The first subclass might include a variety of products, perhaps emanating from the same scribe or scriptorium: potentially, such a volume may be indistinguishable from the second large class of fascicular manuscripts. From this second perspective, a booklet is an object produced. Rather than merely something found or desired by a purchaser, it is an object intended, and perhaps one intended to be joined with other booklets in the same or a similar format. Booklets provided medieval booksellers, who typically produced works to order in what is considered a "bespoke trade," 4 a way to have some ready stock, especially of popular texts, without the major investment inherent in producing a full codex "on spec." Booklets further provided a useful way of building up such large codices out of a series of small sections—a procedure which may have been useful both in terms of marketing and in terms of flexibly planning out the production work. This perspective on the booklet seems to me potentially more interesting than an emphasis on composite texts (which are primarily problems of cataloguing): rather than what may have been largely accidental collocations conceived by a purchaser or an owner several centuries after the fact, this view of the booklet involves actual bibliographical interest in production itself. These two perspectives—the booklet as purchased/the booklet as produced—need to be clearly distinguished. For only the second is of real importance for a pure descriptive bibliography. In the first instance, one cannot with any safety talk about anything other than the taste of the collector of a composite manuscript or the diverse paths of transmission along which the pieces of the book may have passed. Only in the second instance does one deal with the real object of descriptive bibliography, a work with a single mode of production which must, in its more or less problematic nature, be defined. For this reason, it is especially important to distinguish with booklet texts of medieval provenance whether these have been conceived and produced as single volumes or merely reflect the eclectic tastes of an owner. Robinson defines the booklet in the context of other codicological units, such as the quire and the pecia. A booklet is a textual unit which "could circulate independently and at the same time provide a complete copy of a text." Or again, "the existence of a 'booklet' is established only if its content forms a self-sufficient unit. The beginning and end of a 'booklet' always coincides with the beginning and end of a text or group of texts." 5 The definition is designed to separate this unit from both the quire and the pecia, which frequently present only pieces of texts and cannot have an independent life. Again, certain refinements seem necessary. These may be suggested by converting Robinson's definition into questions: "Are all self-sufficient textual units in manuscripts 'booklets?'" Or alternatively, "Are all textual units not self-sufficient in manuscript not 'booklets?'" The first question asks whether groups of quires where the first text begins early in quire 1 and the last text concludes near the end of quire n must necessarily form a booklet. This version of the issue is perhaps best deferred until one considers Robinson's procedures for the recognition of a booklet. The second question asks whether booklets are necessarily self-sufficient and independent units. Here, it seems to me, Robinson's definition of the booklet requires some revision: it seems out of touch with some facts of book-production. Robinson's identification of the booklet directs attention to a fundamental way of forming books in the middle ages, the creation of larger codices from relatively small textual units. Reasons for the prevalence of such a procedure are not far to seek, and I have suggested some of them above. In sum, the booklet occurs with such frequency because of its cheapness and its flexibility: this unit involves a rather minimal commitment of resources while still allowing ongoing book-production. Moreover, the use of the booklet in production forestalls or delays quite indefinitely any very absolute decisions about the form of the final product. That is, for its producer, the booklet creates an infinitely flexible situation in which the codicological form of the resulting book may never be fixed during production. In this case, the booklet will be sold as a single booklet, and it will thus reflect the producer's interest in marketing. The subsequent fate of such a booklet becomes, as I've already suggested, a function of the purchaser's resources and tastes. But other scenarios are possible, if not equally or more probable, and these serve to qualify Robinson's definition. In contrast to the situation I've just described, in which the booklet is simply sold as a small limp bunch of bifolia, at various points in production booklets can become contextualized. That is, a plan for the incorporation of several such units into a single codex may emerge. In many, perhaps most, cases, this plan involves no disruption of the booklet format: a group of booklets is taken up and joined end to end, put additively together, into a single codex. These efforts are ambiguous: they may be indistinguishable from a series of separate booklets bought from a single bookseller and joined by the purchaser. And they offer no challenge to Robinson's definition. 6 But on other occasions, substantial changes may accompany contextualization or codicizing of booklets. In effect, such changes reflect revisions in plan: rather than conceiving of the booklet as a basic unit, the producer begins to conceive of the unit of the whole codex. And when this step occurs, although production proceeds (or has proceeded) within booklet format, the "self-sufficiency" of the booklet is frequently lost. There are, I should think, two models for such a procedure, although both share the same ultimate effect, the obscuring of the existence of booklets altogether. First, booklets of less than a single quire in length can be imbedded into other textual units, typically at their middle, sometimes at their end. Second, larger booklets can be integrated or joined in ways which obscure the original separateness of their production. Such procedures, by readjusting textual linkages, in effect disrupt the appearance of "self-sufficiency" without changing the fact that the codex has been produced by means of booklets. A pair of examples will clarify the point. Robert Thornton's miscellany, Lincoln Cathedral 91, contains at least one hidden single-quire booklet. This codex has been recognized as a fascicular production ever since the manuscript was rebound a decade ago. 7 However, recently John J. Thompson has argued persuasively that what has been taken as the second booklet (quires 4-10) of the manuscript was in fact originally two booklets later joined by adding intermediate quires. 8 Originally, quire 9, folded in reverse so that f. 154, now the eleventh sheet of twenty but originally the twelfth of twenty-two, stood at its head, opened a booklet. This textual unit began, on f. 156, with The Awntyrs off Arthure , which ends on f. 161. At a later date, the quire was refolded and its blank second half, now made its head, used to accomodate runover from the intermediate texts copied from the end of quire 6 through quire 8. To join the two sets of texts, some brief filler items were copied into quire 9. And in the new second half of the quire, an additional text was added, beginning at f. 161 and running over to the end of quire 10 (and of the apparent fascicle). As a result of this sequence of actions, the boundaries of the original have been virtually lost in the extant manuscript. 9 Although one-quire booklets may seem, on an a priori basis, especially useless in the production of manuscripts, the reverse is in fact the case. One's presumption that the single quire would be of minimal aid in preparing a codex is essentially based upon a content-oriented view of production. A single quire quite simply appears a unit of too brief a compass to carry any very viable group of literary texts. Such a view is probably incorrect, 10 and it overlooks a more persuasive reason for using the one-quire booklet, flexibility in production. As I've suggested above, a fundamental reason for booklet production is the possibility of delaying any step which would absolutely determine the shape of the resulting codex. The producer of a codex, in a single-quire booklet, possesses a bibliographical unit which can potentially be fitted into nearly any context. First, so long as the quire remains less than half filled, the size of the single-quire booklet can be adjusted: the scribe has only to fold additional sheets and insert them at the center of the quire to expand his writing space. Even at a later date, booklet size may be expanded by "quiring" the extant booklet within other bifolia. With equal ease, the booklet can be reduced in size. Obviously, the scribe may either remove leaves from the center of the quire, or, if he has begun by leaving one or more outer bifolia as a blank cover to protect his writing, he may reduce booklet size from the outside. And the single-quire booklet can either be utilized "as is"—inserted into the codex alone or at the head of a larger booklet of variable length—or it can be reversed, folded inside out, for use in the middle or at the end of a larger unit. But in this last case, the integrity of the booklet may apparently be lost within the codex which ultimately results. Other processes which seem of tolerably frequent occurrence also render Robinson's effort to associate the booklet with a clear textual unit moot. One might, in this regard, consider the case of Lambeth Palace 491, a manuscript produced by a scribe who elsewhere utilizes booklets. 11 The Lambeth text certainly contains at least parts of two booklets, the materials of quire 21 (ff. 275-290) being the fragmentary opening of a second textual unit. But somewhat less evident is a further booklet division, between lines 632 and 633 of The Siege of Jerusalem , at the end of quire 16 (f. 216 v ). This juncture of two originally separate units may be recognized by four features—excessive wear on some leaves of quire 16, some difficulties of textual presentation within the quire, a change in the signing of the manuscript, and a change in materials at the start of quire 17. First, the scribe finished a copy of the prose Brut on f. 205 v : this leaf and the facing f. 206 r are more heavily worn than the outside leaves of the quire, a fact which suggests that the quire was left for some time folded open to the last copied text page. Some time lapse, apparently fairly protracted, separated copying of ff. 205 v and 206 r . Second, the disposition of the text of The Siege in ff. 206-216 suggests that this portion was copied independently of the remainder of the poem. The scribe apparently began by copying Siege (and conceivably other materials) into subsequent quires, beginning with line 633. He thus had to perform some "casting off" procedure, estimating the amount of copy necessary to fill ff. 206-216; but, unfortunately, he underestimated the number of lines the blank leaves could hold. As a result, these folios show an effort at splaying out the text in hopes of filling the too extensive codicological unit. This effort fails: the scribe writes only sixteen text lines on f. 216 v , rather than his normal twenty-eight to thirty. In addition, this leaf carries a double juncture with the following quire. Originally, the scribe wrote a catchword "As rathe" in his normal fashion at the foot of the then-blank page; but when this last page ended up short of material, as a sign that the textual unit was complete, even though the leaf remained one-third blank, he added after the last text-line the notation "As rathe in proximo folio." Two other features support the notion of independent copying. First, quire 17 is written on a different paper stock than is quire 16, a sign that copying may have proceeded only after a period in which the scribe exhausted his original paper stock. 12 Second, the method of signing leaves changes in the course of quire 16. The scribe has two forms of signing. One is a set of predictable page-foot signatures for the first halves of quires only; these are comprised of a quire letter plus leaf number. The second system is made up of two numbers, one for quire and one for leaf, and appears in the upper right corner of all rectos. The first system runs through the entire manuscript down to f. 274 (quires b-v ); the second covers only the single text, the prose Brut , and ends at the top of f. 205 (running 2.1-16.5). The variation in form, the loss of the second method of signing, again testifies to the separateness of copying. Lambeth 491 thus provides another example of codicizing which obscures booklet boundaries. The procedure here might be contrasted with what Robinson presents as the normal booklet procedure, the cancellation of blank leaves at the end of a booklet. 13 In Lambeth, the scribe simply refuses to waste a substantial amount of material and finds an alternative way to fit his booklets together into a sequential text. But in this process, he did begin by considering ff. 1-216 and 217-274 as separate units; only the sloppiness of his efforts at codicizing them, fusing them into a single manuscript text, allows one to see them as originally separate. And that separateness reveals that booklet production, in this case, does not respect the integrity of textual units. 14 Robinson's effort at defining the booklet then leans too much on the notion of textual self-sufficiency, and not enough on the notion of separately conceived production. In part, this imbalance of presentation should be viewed as not simply pardonable but perhaps almost inevitable. That is, Robinson, in defining the booklet as a unit in a codex must, of course, prove that such a unit in fact exists. Because of this logical necessity, identification of the booklet is crucial: Robinson must work from extant texts and must point out to the reader how to recognize ways in which these texts divide into separable units. In such a context, the evolution of a new codicological tool, the stance of the researcher, seeking examples, rather than of the scribe, producing books for specific purposes, is inescapable. Thus Robinson seems to overemphasize content at the expense of form, and she tends to overlook that feature which I would think most basically distinguishes the booklet from other forms of production, the postponement of any overall plan for a finished book, in some cases until after production has ceased. Since Robinson is interested in defining a codicological unit, a great deal of her work identifies those features which may aid in establishing the existence of a booklet. In her fullest listing, Robinson provides ten such features, not all of which are necessarily present in any single booklet: 15 1. Variation in size of leaves in different parts of a manuscript. 2. Variation in scribal hand or in page format in different parts of a manuscript. 3. Variation in style of decoration or illumination in different parts of a manuscript. 4. Absence of catchwords at ends of quires (which may indicate once independent sections of a manuscript). 5. Independent sets of quire signatures in different parts of a manuscript. 6. Soiled or rubbed outer leaves of a quire. 7. Quires formed of varying numbers of leaves in different parts of a manuscript. 8. Variation in size of possible final quires of a textual unit—either an excessively large quire or a quire containing very few leaves so as to exactly accommodate the end of a text. 16 9. Blank leaves at the end of quires, often cut away. 10. Short texts, filler, added, sometimes in later hands, in originally blank spaces at the end of quires. To these features, one can add three others, one of which has already emerged in previous discussion: 11. Variation in the material from which different parts of a manuscript are made: shifts between paper and vellum, shifts (insofar as these are recognizible) among kinds or qualities of vellum, shifts among different paper stocks. 12. Variation between sources from which different parts of a manuscript have been copied. 13. Variation in subject matter in different parts of a manuscript. Feature number 12 directs attention to one of the most basic causative forces underlying booklet production. That is, if one adopts the view that the most basic definition of the booklet would insist upon the lack of overall planning of a codex until late in production, one reason for desiring such openendedness is simply the limited availability of manuscript sources. Not all texts are universally available to the compiler. As a result, the literary manuscript becomes produced like a commonplace book, a gathering of materials which meet, for whatever reason, the interests of a compiler. Such products, excessively miscellaneous in their contents, frequently reflect, not a single parent or source copied in its full sequence, but an eclectic melding of works derived from different sources. This procedure, the creation of the eclectic miscellany, the volume which testifies to individual and idiosyncratic taste, is one goal easily served by the booklet. In this model, the compiler acquires an exemplar containing some desired texts. These he copies off, perhaps supplementing them with additional texts, heretofore unknown to him but present in the exemplar. This material he copies, very likely retaining the contents order of his exemplar, into a series of quires which may be tailored to form a booklet. Acquisition of a second exemplar leads to the production of a second block of material, which again may be self-contained. At some later point, these various booklets may be bound into a single volume, with or without utilizing those procedures I have earlier called codicizing. In terms of feature 12, verifying apparent booklet limits turns out to be a protracted process. The booklet becomes that manuscript unit most or all of which is based upon use of a single exemplar or archetypal manuscript. 17 It will be identified, first, by noting other codices with which the booklet shares some or all contents, preferably in a similar order. The approach to relatively definitive proof will require collation of the texts in the booklet with those texts putatively related and identification of which textual version is most proximate. This step only approaches identification, since in most cases, at the very best one is only identifying a text which shares with the booklet a common archetype. 18 Feature number 13 calls attention to another principle commonly used in organizing a miscellaneous manuscript. That is, rather than group together materials on the basis of source, all desired texts from the same archetype or exemplar being copied in sequence, a compiling scribe may attempt some rough differentiation by literary type or genre. Robert Thornton is perhaps the most well-known compiling scribe who devides booklets in this way: in his Lincoln 91, for example, items of religious instruction, medical recipes, and romances each appear in different booklets. Similarly, in British Library, Additional 31042, the two alliterative dream debates, Winner and Waster and Parliament of the Three Ages , occupy a separate fascicle. All these features, the ten adduced by Robinson and the three which I add here, share common debilities. For none of them necessarily appears in any given booklet and thus, a priori , the absence of any one neither confirms nor denies the possible presence of a booklet. Moreover, none of the features seems the exclusive property of the booklet as a codicological unit; rather, each equally typifies other forms of manuscript production. These facts create a substantial methodological problem, signalled above by the question, "Are all self-sufficient textual units in manuscript 'booklets'?" That is, ignoring for the moment the issue addressed above of whether booklets are limited only to self-sufficient groups of texts, on finding such a unit how can one be certain that it is in fact a booklet? Can the thirteen criteria mentioned be in any way prioritized? Or, can one identify any necessary criteria for a booklet? First, some of Robinson's criteria can be pretty much eliminated as necessary to the existence of this codicological unit. Some of these features, those which reflect Robinson's effort at explaining "composite" manuscripts, are in effect only useful in separating the products put into shape by a purchaser, someone joining a variety of texts with separate genesis. Of the criteria suggested by Robinson, numbers 1 and 3 and number 2 insofar as it refers to scribal hand (but not to page format) may be rejected from consideration rather quickly. To these, one should probably add numbers 4 and 7, not because they typify "composite," rather than "booklet," manuscripts, but because they form so usual a part of medieval scribal behavior that they cannot be taken in isolation as indicative of any specific bibliographical situation. In fact, catchwords at textual boundaries of any sort are infrequent to rare in occurrence, and odd-sized quires occur frequently and unpredictably in codices clearly planned as full units from their inception and written by single scribes without any apparent interruption. 19 Those criteria which rely on disposition of texts may also be eliminated from consideration. First, if booklets which are textually non self-sufficient occur, some question should arise as to whether disposition of texts can in actuality identify the presence of such a unit. Moreover, the two criteria, numbers 10 and 13 above, which are predicated upon textual contents do not necessarily typify fascicles. 20 Manuscript books of all types can be organized on a subject matter basis; given that some literary productions, lyrics for example, may be by their nature brief, their appearance in no necessary way identifies the conclusion of a textual unit. In fact, some scribes may seek the neatness of beginning, where possible, new major works at the tops of blank rectos or at the head of blank quires; they may thus reserve some leaves to pick up short works without considering or consciously planning their works as fascicles. Following these eliminations, one is left with a group of criteria which deal with the physical formation of quires. The discussion turns, in this case on simply a logical basis, toward items concerned with the basics of book-production. Left for consideration are categories 2 (so far as it relates to page format), 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12. These can be ranked in terms of the persuasiveness of the information each offers, the degree to which each necessarily presents evidence for the presence of a fascicle. In these terms, two of the criteria indicate strongly the probable existence of such a unit; one should consider the remaining features as at best sources of evidence to confirm the first two. Most persuasive, indeed practically definitive, is criterion 5: independent systems of signatures in different parts of a manuscript, even in a codex written by a single scribe, if the scribe is careful, argue strenuously for production as units conceived as independent. 21 Criteria 8 and 9 define booklets with somewhat less, but still a high order of, clarity. These features reflect, in fact, two possible responses to a single production problem, the conclusion of a text. Feature 8 directs attention to the use of casting off procedures to conserve copying materials; feature 9, alternatively, to the willingness to retain a consistent quiring format even at the expense of some wastage. But both procedures clearly mark conclusions and thus probable fascicular boundaries. In this context, the remaining features are of secondary importance. Use of criteria 5, 8, and 9 provides "best evidence" for identifying fascicular boundaries: these limits may be confirmed and supported by recourse to these additional features. Here especially category 12 may be of particular importance: certainly, its inclusion suggests the desirability of rapprochement between the descriptive and analytical bibliography of the manuscript book. One cannot, with propriety, be concerned only with the texts contained in a codex or only with the physical composition of the vehicle for communicating texts. The two studies may properly meet and support one another in the discussion of booklet production. I hope that this treatment of booklet problems draws attention to a particularly valuable and provocative tool for manuscript study. Robinson's insistence upon the piecemeal quality of a great many literary manuscripts has important implications for literary history, insofar as it suggests the independent circulation of texts in very small chunks. This information, when coupled with the findings of such studies as dialectology, may allow for quite precise localizations of medieval literary works and give depth to our sense of the local literary scene in the later middle ages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I am grateful to the Committee on Research, University of California at Riverside, for support which helped in the writing of this paper; and to Robert N. Essick for suggestions which improved it. 1 See the following: "A Study of Some Aspects of the Transmission of English Verse Texts in Late Medieval Manuscripts," unpub. B. Litt. thesis (Oxford, 1972); "Self-Contained Units in Composite Manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Period," ASE , 7 (1978):231-238; (with Frances McSparran) Cambridge University Library Ff.2.38 (London: Scolar, 1979), esp. pp. xii-xvii, xxi-xxv; "The 'Booklet': A Self-Contained Unit in Composite Manuscripts," Codicologica , 3 (1980):46-69; Manuscript Tanner 346 A Facsimile (Norman: Pilgrim, 1980), esp. pp. xix-xx, xxv; and, less relevantly, Manuscript Bodley 638 A Facsimile (Norman: Pilgrim, 1982). 2 N. F. Blake, in a review of the Tanner facsimile, ES , 63 (1982):73, offers an analogous qualification or extension of Robinson's views. In the Tanner volume, Robinson argues strenuously (as she did in the paper, "Some Codicological Implications for the Transmission of Chaucer's Verse," read at New Chaucer Society, San Francisco, April 1982) that the exemplars of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and minor poems may have been fascicles. Blake points out that the production of saleable manuscripts of such works in fascicular form may be more important than the conception of a fascicular exemplar. Blake's view returns to that enunciated by Aage Brusendorff, The Chaucer Tradition (1925), p. 179. 3 All the examples discussed by Robinson in Codicologica belong in the first class. "Binding accidents" of post-medieval origin abound, perhaps most notoriously in the Ashmolean collection of the Bodleian Library and in the Sloane manuscripts at the British Library. 4 See Graham Pollard, "The Company of Stationers before 1557," Library , 4th ser. 18 (1937):1-38, especially pp. 14-18. 5 Codicologica , 3 (1980):46, 47. 6 Huntington Library manuscripts HM 114 (described by Robert K. Root, The Manuscripts of Chaucer's Troilus , Chaucer Society 1st ser. 98 [1914; rpt. New York: Johnson, 1967], p. 35) and HM 144 (described by John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales [1940], I:289-294) are both of this sort. In HM 144, the booklets, with their separate signature systems, probably reflect a purchaser's tastes shortly after 1500. HM 114, in contrast, was apparently planned as three separate units ultimately to be joined: the final verso of each booklet, in what may be the informal script of the scribe, gives a total of quires for the booklet, in the third instance with the added notation "summa 20." The only absolutely certain way of distinguishing fascicles planned to be joined from those bought loose or joined by the purchaser is a series of consecutive signatures, all in the original scribal hand. But such a discovery does not amount to proof positive, unless the signatures are written in an ink indistinguishable from the text (not an invariable expectation even with the signatures of non-fascicular manuscripts). Like the notation of quire totals in HM 114, such signatures may have been affixed only as a way of facilitating binding; see, on this point, Nicholas Barker, "Quiring and the Binder: Quire-Marks in Some Manuscripts in Fifteenth-Century Blind Stamped Bindings," in Studies in the Book Trade in Honour of Graham Pollard, Oxford Bibliographical Society , n.s. 18 (1975):11-31. 7 D. S. Brewer and A. E. B. Owen, The Thornton Manuscript (Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91) (1975), pp. viii-ix. 8 "The Compiler in Action: Robert Thornton and the 'Thornton Romances' in Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91," in Derek Pearsall ed., Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England (1983), pp. 113-124, esp. pp. 119-124. Thompson's conception of how copying proceeded builds on George R. Keiser, "Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91: Life and Milieu of the Scribe," Studies in Bibliography , 32 (1979):158-179, esp. pp. 177-179. 9 George R. Keiser, in an unpublished paper, has suggested that Thornton refolded another one-quire fascicle later in the volume, quire 15, which Keiser believes originally began with f. 271 and the text of The Abbey of the Holy Ghost . I am very grateful to Dr. Keiser for a chance to read his paper, "'To Knawe God Almyghtyn': Robert Thornton's Devotional Book." 10 One-quire booklets seem to have been commonplace in certain contexts; for their use in the transmission of Chaucer's minor poems, see Brusendorff, Tradition , pp. 178-205. A great number, including some very small quires, occur in manuscripts of medieval Latin lyrics; see A. G. Rigg, "Medieval Latin Poetic Anthologies," MS , 39 (1977):281-330, 40 (1978):387-407, 41 (1979):468-505, 43 (1981):472-497; and for further medieval Latin examples, the literature cited by C. N. L. Brooke and R. A. B. Mynors at Walter Map De Nugis Curialium (1983), p. xxix. A Middle English example, also common as a one-quire exemplar (of which thirteen copies in whole or part are known) is identified by A. I. Doyle in his unpublished 1953 Cambridge dissertation, "A Survey of the Origins and Circulation of Theological Writings in England . . .," I:171-74. The texts in question survive in one-quire booklet form as Cambridge, Trinity College B.15.39 (181). Another Middle English example is discussed by Anne Hudson, "A Lollard Quaternion," RES , 22 (1971):435-42. See further n. 17. 11 He also copied HM 114, mentioned above. 12 Similarly Robert Thornton's different booklets seem associated with different paper stocks. These are identified by Sarah M. Horrall, "The Watermarks of the Thornton Manuscripts," N&amp;Q , 225 (1980):385-86. When aligned with the quires of the Lincoln text, these allow one to see examples of unique paper-stocks beginning and ending at booklet boundaries. For example, the Liber de Diversis Medicinis forms a single booklet, entirely on Horrall's stock P, not found elsewhere; the introductory prose Life of Alexander also occupies a whole booklet, about half on stock K, found elsewhere only in three odd sheets within quire 10. 13 Codicologica , 3 (1980):48, criterion 9 for booklet identification. Such a procedure occurs, for example, at the end of quire 3 of Lincoln Cathedral 91, where Robert Thornton cancelled eight leaves. 14 A closely-related but clearly distinguishable case may be mentioned in passing—that of manuscripts copied by several scribes from dismembered exemplars. Here the codex is planned as a sequence of bundles of quires, booklet-like units. And textual boundaries are not apt to be relevant to the separateness of the codicological units. Moreover, such parcelling out of the text may show not simply changes in handwriting but also awkward junctures of units reminiscent of Lambeth 491. Two examples would include "The Trinity Gower" (Cambridge, Trinity College R.3.2), discussed by A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes, "The Production of Copies of the Canterbury Tales and the Confessio Amantis in the Early Fifteenth Century," in Parkes and Andrew G. Watson eds., Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts, and Libraries: Essays Presented to N. R. Ker (1978), pp. 163-210; and Cambridge University Library Ff.v.40, where apparently a portion of the exemplar containing Scale of Perfection I was given to two scribes, one of whose work was eventually cancelled. But such production should be distinguished from the booklet insofar as it generally involves the planning of a fixed unit, the codex, rather than an evolving one. In her discussion of the similar production of Tanner 346, Robinson seems not to wish to make this distinction; see Tanner 346 , pp. xix-xx, xxv. 15 Codicologica , 3 (1980):47-48. 16 One might expand this conception by renaming it "signs of casting off copy," since that idea is clearly present in the expansion or contraction of the normal quire size. Such an expanded notion would allow one to include examples like Lambeth 491 discussed above. 17 Qualifications are necessary, since "filler" items of several folios duration may be derived from a different source. Such is the case, for example, with Bodleian Library, Rawlinson C.285, ff. 64-73, a one-quire booklet, into which one scribe (also responsible for the booklet ff. 40-63) copied the text printed C. Horstmann, Yorkshire Writers (1895-96), I:112-21. Into the blank remainder of the booklet, a second scribe copied two pieces of filler, longer than the original text (printed ibid. , pp. 122-128); a third added Latin notes (printed ibid. , p. 128). 18 The first of these procedures is suggested by A. I. Doyle in his study, "University College, Oxford, MS. 97 and its Relationship to the Simeon Manuscript (British Library Additional 22283)," in Michael Benskin and M. L. Samuels eds., So Meny People, Longages, and Tonges: Philological Essays . . . Presented to Angus McIntosh (Edinburgh: privately, 1981), pp. 265-282. I expand upon Doyle's findings in my forthcoming article, "Origins and Production of Westminster School MS. 3." 19 See, for example, the bemusement of M. B. Parkes and Richard Beadle about the quiring procedures of Cambridge University Library Gg.iv.27 at III:39 of their facsimile (Norman: Pilgrim, 1979-80). For a further example, see that manuscript of the ps.Bonaventuran Meditationes Vite Christi sold at Sotheby's, 6 December 1983, as lot 61 ( Catalogue of Western Manuscripts and Miniatures , p. 62). The codex may be collated as 1-5 8 6-7 6 8-10 8 11 6 12 8 13 6 14 4 (—4); the entire text is present in the hand of a single scribe "Braybrook" (s.xv 1/4 ), and the alternations between 8's and 6's appear totally unmotivated. Indeed the last such alternation, in quire 13, is thoroughly irrational. Had the quire been constructed as an eight, Braybrook could have finished the text on its last leaf (f. 98 v ; the text now ends on that folio); he would not have needed to form the extra, deliberately short, quire 14, nor, having done so, to leave its last two leaves blank and wasted. (A slightly later hand has added as filler on f. 99 excerpts from Isidore of Seville's Synonyma ; the original f. 100 has been cancelled.) 20 Category 10, when the texts have been added in hands subsequent to the main scribe, I take as the functional equivalent of category 9. 21 The inverse, however, is untrue: consistent quire signatures throughout a manuscript may join together units originally planned as booklets. Such is, for example, the case with the texts discussed by Kathleen L. Smith, "A Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Manuscript Reconstructed," BLR , 7 (1966):234-241. Bodleian Library, Douce 324, for example, forms quires designated I and K in a later hand but was planned to form a single fascicle, identifiable on the basis of Robinson's criterion 8.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Two Scribes of the Cardigan Manuscript and the "Evidence" of Scribal Supervision and Shop Production by Daniel W. Mosser *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The desire to establish a definitive ordering of the Canterbury Tales has generated a number of ingenious and sometimes hard-to-follow arguments based both on the internal evidence of the Tales themselves and on the ordering found in those manuscripts which have been determined to be most authoritative (the growing consensus favors the Ellesmere a order 1 ). Too often, the scholarly debate ignores the MSS, but even when the focus is on MS evidence, the risk incurred by assuming too much can undermine the resulting argument. Larry D. Benson describes the usual tendency: "The still flourishing debate over the order of The Canterbury Tales , which has narrowed to arguments for or against the 'Ellesmere order' and the 'Bradshaw shift,' has been carried on pretty much free of any necessity to consult the mss, and proponents on both sides argue almost purely on the basis of literary analysis." However, in trying to shift the focus to manuscript study, Benson commits the error of remaining at least one step removed from the MSS: "I shall therefore try to avoid elaborate speculation and depend instead on the evidence of the mss (drawing almost entirely on Manly and Rickert for evidence; one assumption I do make—and this seems safe enough—is that their analyses of the contents of the mss are generally correct)." 2 While Manly and Rickert probably are "generally correct," my analysis of the Cardigan Manuscript shows that Manly and Rickert's analysis is flawed on at least two critical points and that the conclusions consequent upon those points are in need of revision. One assumption that arguments about the unity and intended order of the Canterbury Tales must make is that there was a highly structured and orderly system of fifteenth-century manuscript production, an assumption which has been challenged by recent scholarship. 3 Manly and Rickert assert that Cardigan contains evidence of shop production: "The MS was certainly made in a shop and under careful supervision, of which unusual traces survive." 4 Therefore, it is of particular importance, given Cardigan's status among Chaucer MSS, either to confirm or refute this assumption. The present study will show that Manly and Rickert's evidence, while highly significant in establishing Cardigan's textual authority, in fact points toward the diametrically opposite conclusion: that the MS was not made in a shop. This conclusion is contingent upon the refutation of Manly and Rickert's proposed "supervisor," a figure who, like the "corrector" referred to by H. S. Bennett, would have been "a familiar figure in any big scriptorium." 5 While Manly and Rickert are correct in observing that Cardigan was carefully "proofread," it was in fact corrected by the scribes themselves. In order to establish this it will first be necessary to determine the number of scribes copying the text and the distribution of their work throughout the book. Cardigan contains a nearly complete text of the Canterbury Tales , lacking the first 152 lines of the Prologue which were presumably contained on two of the three missing folios at the front of the MS. 6 The text of the Tales occupies fols. 1-244 (present foliation). In this portion of the MS, one scribe (referred to in the present study as Scribe A) wrote from fol. 1 through half of fol. 175 verso (Qq 1-16iv: fig. 1). A second scribe (Scribe B) wrote from fol. 175 verso (l. B 2 3109 of the Monk's Prologue ) to fol. 244 recto (the end of Chaucer's Retraction ), where he finishes Q 24 with a sketchy chronicle (fols. 244 recto through 245 verso). This same scribe (though Manly and Rickert believe it was a third scribe) wrote an inserted leaf, fol. 109 in Q 10, and made some corrections in Scribe A's portion of the MS. Scribe A apparently resumes copying at the beginning of Q 25 (fol. 246 recto) and completes the MS through Q 30, copying Lydgate's Siege of Thebes (fols. 246-304 recto) and Churl and Bird (fols. 304 recto-308 verso; three folios and part of the text of Churl and Bird are missing at the end of Q 30). The text is written on parchment, with an average of 40 lines of text, in single columns, to a page. A page averages 12" x 8½" in size (the parchment is trimmed unevenly). Despite Cardigan's interest and importance, of the published accounts I have found which deal with the MS at any length, only two focus on some of the many paleographical and codicological problems that the MS presents. The lack of attention paid to the MS results at least in part from its previous owners' (the Brudenells) refusal to allow scholars to examine it. 7 Cardigan came into the "public domain" only after it turned up at Vassar College following its mysterious disappearance from the library of G. L. Brudenell (see note 6). Before the return of the MS to the Brudenell estate, Manly and Rickert were able to obtain photostats for use in their study of the text of the Canterbury Tales . And it is through that study that the first detailed description of the codicological features of the MS, and to a lesser extent, of the paleographical characteristics of the scribes, was made generally available. 8 More recently, George Keiser has addressed a curious problem presented by the tenth quire of the MS, which I will discuss in the latter portion of this study. In an unpublished dissertation, Robert Lovell presents an edition of the Lydgate material contained in Cardigan and describes the MS in his introduction. 9 Both Keiser and Lovell repeat, and presumably, accept the conclusions of Manly and Rickert concerning the number of scribes and the evidence of supervision. Manly and Rickert (I, 72) propose that the manuscript was executed by three professional scribes. Their scribe 1, whom I will refer to as Scribe A in order to distinguish my references from those of Manly and Rickert, is described as a "somewhat formal, stiff, though cursive hand." Manly and Rickert express some uncertainty about the hand between fols. 246 and 249, where they say "it is probably the same [as scribe 1], though smaller." This scribe's name may have been Ware, since this word appears in the crosshatching of the page headings on fols. 71 verso (fig. 8), 139 recto, and 261 verso. Scribe 2 is characterized as a "freer, more flourished hand." Manly and Rickert say the third scribe has a "still looser hand" (fol. 109 and "probably some of the corrections"). A careful paleographical analysis of the hands in the MS will demonstrate that Manly and Rickert's distribution of work among scribes needs clarification and revision: specifically, that their scribes 2 and 3 are in fact one scribe, Scribe B. The scripts employed by the scribes are cursive and suggest, along with the lack of ornament and decoration, that this vernacular manuscript was made at the request of a family or individual who desired the work for the purposes of reading and reflecting upon its contents; it was clearly not intended to be a "display copy" in the sense that elaborately decorated Books of Hours or the Ellesmere Chaucer Manuscript were. M. B. Parkes has suggested that these types of scripts, which allow for more rapid copying, were developed in response to the increased demand for books. 10 Scribe A uses many of the characteristic graphs of a script labelled by Parkes as anglicana , but also exhibits some tendencies of what would at the time have been a script recently introduced from France, referred to as secretary . Anthony G. Petti, adopting Parkes' terminology, states that the anglicana script was the "chief literary hand at the time of Chaucer . . . formerly known as a court hand ." 11 To achieve the degree of cursiveness necessary to the speeding up of production, letter forms were developed which reduced the number of strokes and changes of pen direction to a minimum. Scribe A's book hand comes closest to the general category of scripts labelled anglicana formata , though it is a somewhat bastardized form, employing some of the graphs and characteristics of secretary . The hand preserves the circular e (fig. 2, l. 1: "gon e ") and regular e (fig. 2, l. 2: "Wh e re"), and sigma s in initial and final position (fig. 2, l. 2: " s o"; l. 3: "hy s "), characteristics of "normal" anglicana , but evidences a "squatter and squarer" appearance associated with formata (derived from textura , a more formal, less cursive script) as well as penstrokes which are thicker and more angled and ascenders which are taller and more arched than is characteristic of normal anglicana (fig. 2: the "squat and square" characteristics are particularly apparent in the graphs for o and d , which, in addition to the regular e graph, are formed by thicker and more angular penstrokes; the ascenders of the graphs for l , d , and h all reflect the tendency toward taller and more arched forms; cf. Petti, p. 14, figs. 11 and 12, anglicana and anglicana formata ). The hand also exhibits, but does not exaggerate, tendencies of the ductus of the secretary script, described as an "antithesis of broad strokes and hairlines placed in different diagonals according to the angle of the slanted pen," which gives the hand a slight "splayed" appearance (Parkes, p. xix). Especially characteristic of this tendency in Scribe A's work are the graphs for u , m , and n , formed with far fewer strokes than the more laboriously formed graphs of anglicana formata (fig. 2, l. 3: "thr u gh" "stry n ges"; l. 5: " m an"). The hand also tends to emphasize the taper of the descenders, one of the first secretary features to appear in anglicana hands (Parkes, p. xxii). The scribe's habituation to the anglicana graphs is apparent in the retention of the two-compartment a and "double-diamond" g (fig. 2, l. 2: "th a t"; l. 1: "kyn g e"). The d graph remains looped, unlike the hybrid anglicana form (fig. 2, l. 3: "an d ") (Petti, p. 15, fig. 14: hybrid anglicana ). The scribe's confidence in the execution of the script is evident in the consistency of the vertical upright strokes, in the regular spacing and shape of the letters, and in the execution of the complex form of w (a pair of rounded loops with a backwards 3 affixed finally: fig. 2, l. 1: " w ith"). A hand which is similar to that of Cardigan A appears in a copy of John Gower's Confessio Amantis , dated to the early part of the fifteenth century (Cambridge, Trinity College MS R. 3. 2) (Doyle and Parkes, p. 163, pl. 44 [Trinity A]). While this manuscript is dated at least twenty-five years earlier than the Cardigan MS, the A scribe's hand in the Trinity MS is representative of the direction that the anglicana script was moving in the years between 1425 and 1450. Thus it would not be unusual to find this style of anglicana script in Cardigan around 1450. Indeed, characteristics of the script continue to surface as late as 1475, in the hand of Stephen Doddesham (Parkes, pl. 6ii). A very general distinction can be made between the overall feeling of "roundness" displayed by the hand of Scribe A and the angularity of the hand produced by Scribe B. Petti notes that this is a key distinction between the anglicana and secretary scripts, and Scribe B much more closely approximates the secretary script than does A, not only in producing this feeling of angularity but also in the use of characteristic secretary graphs. On the other hand, the wide variety of forms for the individual letters that can be found in Scribe B's script is evidence of the difficulty with which the transition to the secretary script was made. Cardigan B uses both sigma and B-shaped s finally, the latter being especially characteristic of secretary (fig. 3, l. 3: "hi s "; l. 5: "Maximu s "). Also notable is the alternation between a "double-v" shaped w (fifteenth-century secretary ) and the "two-looped l and 3" anglicana form (fig. 3, l. 16: " w as" (inserted); l. 15 "tro w "). Scribe B also uses two other forms of w which fall somewhat in between these extremes. The distribution of these forms appears to be idiosyncratic. Forms of g are also mixed, with both the single compartment tailed secretary and the double compartment anglicana graphs in evidence. The secretary g is less common, but again the distribution follows no set pattern ( secretary : fig. 1, l. 16: " g od"; l. 17: " g entyll" " g oste"; anglicana : fig. 3, l. 1: "Image"). A very distinctive final r graph, long and forked with a finishing stroke forming a leftward loop, is often apparently used to abbreviate a final -re (fig. 3, l. 3 "he r "). 12 Both circular e and regular e are used (fig. 3, l. 12: "pr e chyng"; l. 1: "Imag e ") and double compartment anglicana a is regular (fig. 3, l. 1: "Im a ge"), though single compartment secretary a appears occasionally. The looped d of anglicana alternates with the unlooped form of the hybrid script (fig. 3, l. 1: "an d "; l. 2: "an d "). Scribe B uses a number of abbreviations, especially in the prose sections, but his use of them, as well as his use of þ (thorn) for th , which he does often, is inconsistent. A comparison of portions of Cardigan with a microfilm of the Manchester Chaucer MS (Chaucer and Manchester were copied from a common exemplar) suggests that Scribe B was often influenced by his exemplar. This also holds true for the variation between I/y for the first person singular pronoun, which varies in Manchester in many of the same places where B varies his use in Cardigan. The scribe's hand is cursive, though the letters are frequently not joined, and the thick-and-thin stroke alternation is characteristic of secretary (fig. 3, l. 13: note the contrast between the horizontal and diagonal strokes in the z -shaped r in the word "f r o" and between the vertical and diagonal strokes in the m of "he m " in l. 7), as are the very tapered descenders (more tapered than Cardigan A's), as in the long s and f graphs (fig. 3, l. 2: " s acre f yce"). The upward strokes of the graphs do not lead the eye in one direction consistently, unlike the hand of Scribe A whose graphs tend to slant to the right, and the tension produced by the conflicting directions might convey an initial impression of haste and carelessness (fig. 3: note for instance the way the upright strokes of a and d in "and" at the beginning of lines 1 and 2 slant leftwards, while in "sacrefyce" the upright strokes of the s and f graphs are either vertical or rightward-slanting). The hand is characteristic of the middle of the fifteenth century and bears some resemblence to the hands of William Ebesham and some members of the Paston family. 13 This paleographical analysis shows that two scribes writing with scripts of clearly separate and distinct character copied this manuscript. However, Manly and Rickert also identify a third scribe who copied only one folio, 109, and who made "some corrections." Analysis of this hand reveals the same identifying features found in the script used by Scribe B. A comparison of a sample of the "third scribe's" hand with that of Scribe B shows a clear correspondence between graphs, for example Th at the beginning of a line (fig. 4, l. 11: " Th is"/fig. 3. l. 13: " Th ey"), w (fig. 4, l. 1: " w arne"/fig. 3, l. 2: " w ho" " w olde"), and v (fig. 4, l. 3: "lo v yst"/fig. 3, l. 4: "de v yse"). A further comparison between Scribe B's hand and the corrections Manly and Rickert state were "probably made" by scribe 3 confirms the presence of the same identifying characteristics (fig. 3, l. 3: " h er"; l. 2: " w ho"/fig. 7, marginal correction: " wh er"). A comparison of the inks used provides additional confirmation that Manly and Rickert's scribes 2 and 3 were in fact one scribe, Scribe B. Scribe A uses what is most likely an iron paste base for his ink, which is darker in some places where a fresh batch results in a higher concentration of particulate matter. The usual color of this ink in the MS is a russet brown. This ink has the quality of producing a wash-like effect (gradations of color within individual strokes). Scribe B uses a carbon base ink from fol. 175 verso, where he takes over from A, through fol. 177, where he switches to an iron paste base. The carbon base ink produces a much more uniform stroke (not wash-like) and ranges from black to a brownish-gray, depending on the consistency of the batch. This same carbon base ink is used by the scribe who copied fol. 109 and made some corrections in A's portion of the MS. With the knowledge that Scribe B copied fol. 109 as well as fols. 175 verso through 245 verso, we can now also speculate that he executed fol. 109 shortly before he began work on fols. 175 through 177, using the same batch of ink. 14 It is also now clear from this paleographical analysis that Scribe A was responsible for fols. 246 through 249, which Manly and Rickert had stated was only "probable" and which their description seems to indicate could have been copied by either of the two main scribes. It was largely the difference in letter size which contributed to their confusion on this point, and since both Scribe B and Scribe A are using an iron paste base in their ink at this point in the MS (where A resumes copying) it is not possible to differentiate on the basis of ink analysis. However, despite the difference in letter size (an average body height of 2 mm in fol. 246 compared to an average of 2.5 to 3 mm elsewhere in the MS, except in some of the prose sections where the letter size approximates that in fol. 246) the identifying characteristics of Scribe A's script are clearly present in this disputed section. Thus far I have shown that there are only two scribes copying in Cardigan, Scribes A and B, rather than the three scribes proposed by Manly and Rickert and assumed by others who have faithfully accepted Manly and Rickert's analysis. We have also seen that the scribe who copied the first four folios of the Lydgate material (fols. 246-249) was indeed Scribe A and that some of the corrections made in portions of A's work (i.e. those which A did not make himself) were made by Scribe B. A more detailed examination of the codicological evidence will establish that these two scribes were also the "supervisor" or "examinatur" whose traces led Manly and Rickert to assume that this MS was produced in a shop. It is clear from their description of this evidence that they distinguished the person who left these traces of supervision from the scribes: After numerous corrections by the scribes, made so carefully that they are not always easy to see (sometimes insertions, sometimes changes over erasure), some one else went over the text and made scores of further corrections and changes, using black ink. That the text was read critically by a supervisor appears in the scribbled abbreviation "ex'" (examinavi, examinatur?) which occurs on many leaves, usually at the foot of a verso. . . . Although it is not put in with regularity, it certainly means that the text was, as we should say, proof-read (I, 72-73). We already know that Scribe B made some corrections in portions of A's work, using black ink. Other corrections in black ink can be attributed to Scribe A by making comparisons similar to those above. Manly and Rickert's assertion that the "ex'" notation does not occur with any "regularity" must also be challenged. The notation can be found at the end of Qq 2, 3, 4, 5, 26, 27, and 28 (fols. 18v, 28v, 40v, 52v, 268v, 280v, and 292v). In addition, the notation can be found within quires, usually beside corrections. Manly and Rickert observe this in fols. 47v (Q 5), 69r (Q 7), 212r (Q 20), 214r (Q 21), 248v (Q 25 [see fig. 2]; they are unsure of this one, but it is there), 278r (Q 27), and 289r (Q 28). I have confirmed four additional occurrences not previously noted by Manly and Rickert in fols. 219v (Q 21), 258r (Q 26), 264v (Q 26), and 268v (previously noted above). The "ex'" can thus be found thirteen times in Scribe A's portion of the MS and three times in Scribe B's. The long hiatus between Q 7 and Q 20 interrupts the fairly regular pattern where we find the notation on the last verso of each quire. The regularity is not reestablished until Scribe A resumes copying in the Lydgate portion of the MS. This is a puzzle which can, I believe, be satisfactorily unravelled, and the first step in this process involves a comparison of the "ex'" notation with the hand of the scribe who is copying at those points in the MS where it is found. In each case, the characteristics of ductus and graph formation make an identification with the scribe possible. The usual position of the notation can be seen in fol. 28 verso (fig. 5) where it occurs adjacent to the final catchword of the quire. A comparison of the notation with the first two letters of "exortacyon" (fig. 2, l. 3) reveals a clear correspondence between the graphs for x : a bold downward stroke, slashing from left to right, crossed by a rounded 2-shaped stroke which has an elongated tail crossing the initial stroke at the bottom from left to right. The angle of the initial, circular e 's differs, but an e written at the same angle can be found in the word "on e " (fig. 2, l. 6), and a quick inspection of the variety of circular e 's appearing in fig. 2 confirms that the angle at which the letter is placed is not at all regular. While there are fewer examples of the notation occurring in Scribe B's portion of the MS, a comparison of the x graph of the notation which appears in the gutter of fol. 212 recto (fig. 6) with the x 's which occur in fig. 3, executed by Scribe B (ll. 5 and 9: "Ma x imus") shows the similarity of graph formation: a single stroke, crossing downward from left to right to the level of the bottom (unruled) line, and then curving back upward and left in a very rounded stroke before crossing itself and finishing in a rightward-curving tail. In Qq 10 and 11, where we find evidence of B proofreading A's work, no examples of the notation made by either A or B can be found. Scribe A apparently discontinued that kind of correcting and proofreading (there are still numerous examples of concurrent corrections) following Q 7, only to resume the procedure in the Lydgate portion of the MS. Quite possibly the absence of a notation by A in these intervening quires alerted B to the need to reexamine that material. In Q 10, he must have discovered something which caused him to insert fol. 109 (established above as the work of Scribe B). Manly and Rickert propose that in Q 10, the scribe copied the first 9 leaves (ending at E 1382). At that point his exemplar had lost one folio (82 lines). He, however, did not notice this until he had copied two more leaves. Then another person discovered the omission and copied the 82 lines on a half-sheet (f. 109). Why he did not allow this to make a 13th leaf in the quire is puzzling; but what he actually did was to cut off f. xii (between 111-112), the gemel of i, possibly with the desire of keeping to the scheme of twelves (but Q 3 is a ten) (I, 71-72). The first problem with this analysis is that it is unlikely that a scribe would cut away a perfectly good leaf for the sake of uniformity, which, as Manly and Rickert observe above, is not rigidly maintained anyway. A second problem is that if the scribe's exemplar had lost a folio, why was he able to predict that the first words of that folio would be "I warne the," which he has signalled by the catchword placed at the bottom of fol. 108 verso? Manly and Rickert state that the placing of catchwords on the last 6 folios of a 12-leaf quire is "unusual" (I, 74), so we cannot easily ascribe this knowledge of missing material to a faithful copying of the exemplar. Diagram A: The state that Keiser proposes the supervisor found Q 10 to be in with the i-xii bifolium having been misplaced after the text was copied onto i, but before it was copied onto xii. Thus xii became x and in moving i back to its correct position in the gathering "the order vii-viii-ix-xi-xii-x would have been created." Diagram B: The present ordering of Q 10. The original xii has been excised, leaving a large stub between fols. 111 and 112. The stub between fols. 102 and 103 has, presumably, been left to allow the inserted folio, 109, to be more easily bound into the gathering, the stub being part of the sheet which forms fol. 109. George Keiser offers a different explanation for the appearance of Q 10. Diagram A illustrates Keiser's version of the disarrangement of the quire. He believes that a "supervisor" discovered that "the outer bifolium was accidentally moved so that the order became ii-iii-i-iv-v-vi. (Such a disarrangement would be easily possible in view of the fact that there are no catchwords used in the first part of the quires in this manuscript)." Keiser goes on to say that the proofreader then "discovered the disarrangement and moved i back to its proper position, thereby creating the order vii-viii-ix-xi-xii-x in the second part of the quire. To remedy this problem, he cut away the right half of the i-x bifolium near the inner vertical margin line of x, leaving a stub to facilitate binding of the remaining leaf (f. 100) with the quire." Diagram B shows the present state of the gathering, with the stub left by the cutting away of the gemel of i (fol. 100). Keiser believes that the supervisor assigned the copying of fol. 109, the inserted leaf, to "another scribe," leaving a stub "to facilitate its binding into the quire." That scribe, as well as the supervisor, was Scribe B, as established above. Keiser says that the proof that this explanation is correct is provided by ink marks on the stub between fols. 111 and 112 (fig. 9). This stub is the gemel of i, the out-of-place text having been excised. Not only do the ink marks establish that the folio contained text before it was cut away, pace Manly and Rickert, but, according to Keiser, they also establish that the text contained on the missing folio was the same as that found on the present fol. 109. Of the two ink marks, Keiser says that the first is "a symbol regularly used by the scribes to aid the reader by indicating the beginning of a new stanza in works written in stanzaic form, or in other cases, to indicate shifts in subject or speaker." The key here is that if the stub is held against fol. 112 verso it is clear that the mark occurs at what would have been the tenth line from the top. Manly and Rickert's theory would require us to believe that the leaf that has been cut away originally contained either no text at all or perhaps the text now found on f.112. In the latter case the mark would occur at E.1642, a line that is dependent for its sense on the preceding line and therefore not a very likely place for such a mark. However, the tenth line of f.109a is E.1393, the line at which the narrator, having completed his digression on marriage, resumes the narrative and which reads as follows in the Cardigan text: "This olde knyght Ianuari e the which I told." This, of course, would be a natural place for the scribe to place the mark (Keiser, pp. 333-334). Keiser's "proof" is problematic. The top ink mark on the stub, a stanza marker, does indeed line up with the tenth line of text on fol. 112 recto. But in fig. 4 we can see that the tenth line of text on fol. 109 recto reads: "And namely vpon the wyffys syde." The line cited by Keiser as the "natural place" for such a marker is in fact the eleventh line. A comparison of the text with that in Manchester, the MS sharing a common exemplar with Cardigan, reveals that such a marker is placed in the margin next to the line (E 1393: "This olde knyght . . ."). But there is also a marker in the margin next to the line which corresponds to the first line on fol. 109 of Cardigan, E 1383: "I warne the yf þou wysely wolt worch." Why this marker does not also appear on the stub is a problem. What is important to this study, however, is that it is at this point in the book that we first find evidence of Scribe B at work, while the evidence of Scribe A proofreading his own work, which we find in the earlier and latter quires of the MS, is lacking. When Scribe B does enter the project as the main scribe, he does so rather abruptly in fol. 175 verso (fig. 1), in the middle of a page and in the middle of a quire. This intrusion deviates from the usual practice, when multiple scribes were engaged in the production of a single manuscript, of changing over between gatherings. While Scribe A's gatherings are customarily twelves, Q 16 becomes a gathering of eight, which is usual for B. We may never know what happened to Scribe A at this point, but we can speculate that when B entered the project, he may have noted that Qq 8-16 had not been proofread and so began the task himself, perhaps to acquire a "feel" for the plan and execution of the codex. He then found the problem in Q 10, executed fol. 109, and proceeded to make some other corrections in black ink. After finishing Q 16, as well as the rest of the Canterbury Tales through the Retraction , he then appended the chronicle to complete the gathering of eight which makes up Q 24. The question that must be asked at this point is why Scribe A would have reentered the project in Q 25 (fol. 246 recto, the Siege of Thebes ) without proofreading Qq 8-16, instead turning that work over to Scribe B? If the MS was made in a shop, as Manly and Rickert state, then certainly he would have had access to the material. But what if it was not executed in a shop, but was instead "farmed out" to independent craftsmen? Doyle and Parkes (pp. 196-197) cite the failure of various craftsmen to interact as evidence of a "bespoke" book trade. Scribe B left blanks for initial capitals with guide letters in the margins (fols. 176r, 186r, 188v, 194r (twice), 201r, 203r, 213r, 216r, 217r, and 244r) which were never filled in. In a shop, a limner should have been on hand to complete these initials, the only places in Cardigan where any evidence of intended decoration appears. This evidence, coupled with the absence of a "shop supervisor" (the scribes provided their own supervision), points to the manuscript's having been produced by independent craftsmen. We must therefore conclude that Scribe A either abandoned the work or became unable to finish. A similar case is that of Trinity Scribe A, whom Doyle and Parkes (p. 166) point out was replaced by another scribe before the end of a gathering, in the middle of a line of verse. This change, they say, "suggests that A had abandoned his task rather than a transition from one portion of an exemplar to another." If Cardigan A did abandon the job at fol. 175, it would seem most unlikely that he would then, as the present order of the MS suggests, have resumed the project at a later date. But what if the present order does not reflect the original order of execution and/or intention? While the Siege of Thebes does begin a new gathering, there is neither title nor incipit preceding it, as is characteristic in the MS before and after all the Tales and Prologues . An explicit does occur at the end of the poem, just as one would expect, preceding Churl and Bird . Recall also the confusion caused Manly and Rickert by the relatively smaller letter size of Scribe A's hand at this point, which gradually becomes larger through fol. 249, where it achieves the size characteristic of the rest of A's work in the MS. There peculiarities—the missing incipit, the change in handwriting size, the peculiar changeover of scribes in fol. 175 verso and again at fol. 246 recto—suggest that Scribe A began his work on the MS with the Lydgate material, writing in a smaller hand, gradually acquiring a feel for the constraints of the writing space (where there are space limitations, as in some of the prose tales, both Scribe A and B write much smaller). Then after finishing the Lydgate material, Scribe A began work on the Canterbury Tales , continuing until something interrupted his work on fol. 175 verso. The codicological evidence is inconclusive. The sheet of parchment which forms the outer folios of Q 24 (fols. 238 and 245) is a full thickness of sheepskin, while the Cardigan scribes write primarily on sheets of split sheepskin. The splits result in two types of hair sides (an inner and an outer) as well as two types of flesh sides (an inner and an outer), making it difficult at times to determine whether a given page is hair or flesh (Yeager). While at least two other gatherings, Qq 6 and 27, are also enclosed by full-skin sheets (comprising fols. 53 and 64, and fols. 269 and 280 respectively), Q 24 also has several sheets of full skin within the quire. This may suggest that the last quire of Scribe B's work was especially reinforced as an intended final gathering of the codex, which would be subject to greater wear and strain. The present final gathering (Q 30), consisting of most of Churl and Bird , which begins on the recto of the final folio of the preceding quire, was apparently intended to be a gathering of six, since there is a catchword on iv (fol. 308v) and Scribe A customarily places catchwords on all the versos of the last half of a gathering. One can also see sewing between fols. 307 and 308. Manly and Rickert, overlooking this evidence, suggest that it may have been an "original 12" (I, 71). Churl and Bird would require only part of one more folio, and thus what the remaining sheets contained, if anything, remains a mystery. The fact that the gathering was intended to be one of six rather than twelve indicates that the scribe either anticipated the end of the MS or desired to keep the material discrete from whatever was to follow. Even if the material was intended to follow the Chaucer material, it might very well have been copied first, and the popularity of Lydgate in the fifteenth century makes it at least possible that this portion was considered to be more important than the Canterbury Tales . 15 Another reason why the compiler of Cardigan might have chosen to place the Lydgate material before the Canterbury Tales in the manuscript is the special affinity between the Siege of Thebes and the Knight's Tale : both deal with the Theban story, a story though of today as legendary, but which in the fifteenth century was often referred to as "historical." 16 Given the inclusion of the chronicle in the codex, it would seem that the compiler had an interest in history, and an ordering which placed the Siege of Thebes before the Knight's Tale would present the story chronologically. Admittedly, though, the intervention of the Churl and Bird does pose a problem for this theory. Besides Cardigan, four other MSS contain the Siege of Thebes and the Knight's Tale : Additional 5140, Christ Church CLII, Egerton 2864, and Longleat 257. Of these, only Longleat 257 is presently ordered to place the Siege of Thebes before the Knight's Tale (there called Arcite and Palamon ) (Manly and Rickert, I, 339). In Cardigan, a marginal notation, a flourished n or nota marker, can be found at several points in the Siege of Thebes and the Knight's Tale (and only in those two works) at points of sententia or narratorial intrusion, creating a further bond between the two "historical" tales. 17 The worn, well-thumbed condition of the first full page of the Knight's Tale , coupled with the worn condition of the first page of the Siege of Thebes , suggests not only that these tales were frequently handled and read, but that they may have been kept separate from the other materials in an unbound state, with the two worn pages serving as "cover-sheets" and with the present, bound ordering of Cardigan reflecting a later owner's sense of priorities. That at least fol. 10 (the first leaf of Q 2 and the first full page of the Knight's Tale ) once served as a cover-sheet is strongly suggested by the appearance in the upper right corner of the signature of Thomas Brudenell (cf. note 6). While none of the pieces of the puzzle discussed above offers a conclusive solution to the problem of the unusual interaction between the scribes or to the problem of the "correct" ordering of Cardigan, taken together they do offer a reasonable explanation for the apparent absence of evidence of regular "supervision" of the scribes' work between Qq 7 and 20, that is, the lack of the "ex'" notation in those quires which does occur with great regularity at the end of gatherings at the beginning and end of the MS. First of all, there was no separate supervisor who proofread the entire MS. This task was undertaken by the scribes themselves, as the paleographical evidence presented above so clearly shows. The paleographical and codicological evidence also suggest very strongly that Scribe A began his work on the MS with the present fol. 246 (Q 25) and ended on fol. 175 verso of Q 16, apparently unexpectedly. Scribe A carefully proofread his work in Qq 25-28 and 1-7, but not in what must have been the last portion he worked on, Qq 8-16. These portions were proofread by Scribe B when he took over the project, and while they contain evidence of B's editorial and scribal concern, they do not contain evidence of the usual "ex'" notation. But Scribe B exhibits no regular pattern in his use of the symbol and, indeed, it occurs only three times in his portion of the work. None of this evidence supports Manly and Rickert's assertion that the MS was "certainly made in a shop"; indeed, had the Cardigan MS been executed and compiled in a scriptorium, we would expect to find a regular pattern of evidence of supervision independent from that of the scribes. The evidence suggests instead that independent craftsmen produced the book, that Cardigan was originally intended for one scribe—Scribe A—and that only when he was unable to finish did another scribe begin work on it. I remain hopeful that further work on this and other MSS, especially those containing similar materials, will produce some answers to the question of the intended order of the very important compilation. 18</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A version of this article was presented to the Ninth Annual Conference of the Southeastern Medieval Association held at the University of Virginia, 7-8 October 1983. I would like to thank the staff of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center (HRHRC) at the University of Texas at Austin for all the assistance they have given me during the course of this Study and for the photographs provided by their courtesy. Cardigan is catalogued at the HRHRC as MS 143. Most descriptions date the MS as c.1450, based on the chronicle contained in it which ends in 1449. My paleographical analysis supports this date. The HRHRC also owns Phillipps 6750 (Ph 1 ), an important Chaucer MS containing two fragments of the Canterbury Tales . 1 Charles A. Owen, Jr., "The Alternative Reading of The Canterbury Tales : Chaucer's Text and the Early Manuscripts," PMLA , 97 (1982), 237, 250, n. 31. Owen discusses this "growing consensus" for the Ellesmere a order and challenges it, offering an alternative reading which "sees the text of Chaucer's masterpiece as a collection of fragments reflecting different stages of his plan for the work as a whole" (246). 2 Larry D. Benson, "The Order of The Canterbury Tales ," SAC , 3 (1981), 78, 80. 3 Owen, 237: "the neat pile of manuscript postulated by Robert A. Pratt and other proponents of the Bradshaw shift is a fiction.

Ker , ed. M. B. Parkes and A. G. Watson (1978), p. 199: "we can find no evidence for centralized, highly organized scriptoria in the metropolis and its environs at this time other than the various departments of the central administration of government, and no evidence that these scriptoria played any part—as organizations—in the copying of literary works." 4 John M.

Bennett, "The Production and Dissemination of Vernacular Manuscripts in the Fifteenth Century," The Library , 5th ser., 1 (1947), 174. 6 The three pages missing at the front of the MS were apparently lost when Cardigan was stolen from the Brudenell library. A. S. G. Edwards, "The Case of the Stolen Chaucer Manuscript," The Book Collector , 21 (1972), 380-385, citing the notes of a private detective investigating the theft, states that "'when the Chaucer MS. was at Brudenells two front pages were in it. Maggs says that the first two pages were torn out when he got it [Maggs was the first of several dealers who handled the stolen MS]. As a matter of fact A. E. Brudenell's name was inscribed on 2nd page.' Certainly the manuscript lacks at least two initial leaves in its present state" (382, n. 7). Apparently the leaves were removed to conceal the Brudenell's ownership of the MS when the thief sold the book to Maggs Bros. The theft is also discussed in "The Cardigan Chaucer: Adventures of a MS.," Anon., The London Times , February 19, 1925, p. 15. 7 "Notes on Sales: The Cardigan Chaucer," Anon., Times Literary Supplement , March 19, 1925, p. 207: "for some arbitrary reason the late Lady Cardigan refused all requests of scholars to examine the manuscript. Even Professor Skeat and Dr. Furnival were not allowed to collate it." 8 The Cardigan MS turned up at Vassar College following its theft, having been purchased for the College by Henry Noble MacCracken from a New York dealer on June 20, 1923. While the MS resided at Vassar, Clara Marburg was able to study it. An article by Marburg, "Notes on the Cardigan Manuscript," PMLA , 41 (1926), 229-251, appeared subsequently. In it she asserts that "it is evident that the Cardigan MS belongs to the Dd-subdivision of the A-group" (230), which is contradicted by Manly and Rickert, who associate Cardigan with Manchester English 113 (Ma) in a group distinct from Dd (II, 51-54). Charles A. Owen, Jr. also distinguishes Cardigan from the Dd-group ("The Pre-1450 Manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales ," Unpublished). The article cited in note 7 (above) provides a description of the MS which predates Manly and Rickert. The description is not always accurate. For example, Cardigan is described as containing "244 vellum leaves," the number of leaves covering the Chaucer portion of the MS only (not counting the missing leaves). Marburg (230) states that the MS contains "555 pages." 9 George R.

Apparently with Isidore ( Etymologiarum , XIV, Ch. iv, 10) as his authority Ralph Higden refers to parts of the Thebes story at several points in his Polychronicon . . . and in a passage which assumes historical authenticity for both the Thebiad and Lydgate's poem, Caxton refers his readers to 'Stacius' and the 'siege of thebes' for more information." 17 The nota marker occurs in the Knight's Tale in fol. 19v, l. A1967; fol. 20v, l. A2051; fol. 23r, l. A2155; fol. 23v, l. A2208; fol. 23v, l. A2220; and fol. 33r, l. 2965. In the Siege of Thebes it occurs at fol. 249v, l. 294; fol. 249v, l. 307; fol. 250r, l. 325; fol. 250r, l. 335; and fol. 252v, l. 604. 18 While this article was in press, further research has produced additional strong support for the assertion that Scribe A began his copying with the Lydgate material and then moved on to the Canterbury Tales . In the Lydgate material and the early part of Fragment A of the CT , the scribe favors the pronoun forms here ("her"), here ("their"), and hem ("them"), but gradually, during his copying of the CT , the forms hure , there , and them (for "her," "their," and "them" respectively) become exclusive. This pattern only makes sense if one accepts the reordering hypothesis; otherwise, we would have to believe that Scribe A systematically developed a pronoun paradigm which eventually excluded the use of the " h- " forms and then readjusted his usage not only to include those forms in the Lydgate material, but to favor them over their alternatives.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Thynne's Printing of the Squire's Tale : Manuscripts and Printer's Copy by Donald C. Baker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That William Thynne used one or more manuscripts for consultation during his printing of the Canterbury Tales for his 1532 edition has long been assumed, but the evidence has been both vague and contradictory. W. W. Greg, in his analysis of the early printed editions using the first 116 lines of the Knight's Tale , concluded that Thynne had consulted a manuscript of the large group that Manly was to call the cd * group. 1 Koch had suggested Phillipps 8137 (or Ph 3 , to give it the Manly-Rickert sigil), as a type of the manuscript used by Thynne. 2 But Pearsall, in his Variorum Chaucer edition of the Nun's Priest's Tale , concluded that for that tale there is no solid evidence of Thynne's use of manuscripts. 3 Ross, however, for his edition of the Miller's Tale in the same series, concluded that a manuscript very close to c / d in Manly's classification was used by Thynne for that tale. 4 I remarked in my edition of the Manciple's Tale that, though it was difficult to be conclusive in such a short poem, nevertheless the number of variants introduced by Thynne certainly suggested the use of a manuscript, or perhaps several. 5 The most intensive work upon Thynne's sources has been done by J. E. Blodgett, who in his essay upon Thynne in Editing Chaucer: The Great Tradition , 6 though he is quite specific about Thynne's use of manuscripts for other works, again concludes only that for the Canterbury Tales Thynne did use manuscripts, but does not speculate upon which manuscripts. That Thynne was something of a scholar has long been recognized; we know that a good many Chaucerian manuscripts passed through his hands (Blodgett, p. 39). In the course of studying the printed tradition of the Squire's Tale , I have, I believe, uncovered evidence which allows us to be much more specific about the kinds of manuscripts which Thynne used, at least in the preparation of the text of that poem. I emphasize that I am restricting my conclusions to the Squire's Tale , for there is no reason to believe that, if Thynne had had a number of manuscripts by him for the Canterbury Tales , he would have confined himself to one or two for the setting of the entire work. So, for the moment, my conclusions apply only to that fairly short poem. First, it is spectacularly obvious that Thynne had recourse to texts outside the printed tradition. His text of the Squire's Tale introduces 365 readings not found in the early printed editions: the two Caxtons (CX 1 and CX 2 ), the two Pynsons (PN 1 and PN 2 ) and Wynkyn de Worde (WN). This in a poem of only 700 lines (counting the Merchant/Franklin Link)! The numbers of the lines in which Thynne's new readings occur are given below, 7 but I want to select a number of Thynne's variants which allow us to point rather clearly to one or more manuscripts, not now extant, which seem for the Squire's Tale to be very, very close, perhaps sister manuscripts, to Delamere (Dl), McCormick (Mc), and Rawlinson Poet. 141 (Ra 1 ). McCormick and Rawlinson 141 are, of course, bracketed by Manly and Rickert very closely together as the subgroup Mc , and Manly concludes that Rawlinson 141 is very close to McCormick, ". . . quite possibly copied from it". 8 Delamere is described as being usually attached to the large group cd *. Manly (VI, 506) observes of Dl and Mc that until l. 558 they are together for the Squire's Tale . (Mc Ra 1 are out for the following link.) I shall argue further that, particularly in the latter stages of the poem, Thynne seems to have consulted one or more manuscripts from the Rawlinson Poet. 149 (Ra 2 ) Hatton Donat (Ht) group, or its close relatives. Rawlinson 149 and Hatton are the subgroup Ra 2 , and are together in the Squire's Tale according to Manly (II, 292-293). At line 21, Thynne has the new reading trewe for sooth . This is found, according to the Corpus of Variants in the Manly-Rickert edition, in only three manuscripts, Dl, Mc and Ra 1 . At line 61 Thynne has the reading so royal for solempne . Only Mc and Ra 1 have this reading. Thynne has at line 96 com for were come ; only Mc Ra 1 and Ht have this. For the Thynne reading of instead of with in line 97 corroboration is found only in Dl. In line 107 Thynne reads my commun instead of commune ; only Mc and Ra 1 have this reading. Thynne introduces the writhyng in line 127, a reading found only in Dl Mc Ra 1 . In line 139, Thynne's the for his is found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 176, Thynne's new reading al born was for and born anon is found only in Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's new reading bokes for gestes in line 211 is found only in Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's new reading at 228, certes for and seyde is found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 244, Thynne's eke with al for ther withalle is found only in Dl Mc Ra 1 . In line 257 Thynne's they cessen for cesseth is found only in Dl Mc Ra 1 . In line 280, Thynne's her for his is found in only four manuscripts, three of them being Dl Mc Ra 1 . At line 298, Thynne's new reading hit to rehersen instead of yow rehercen is found in only four manuscripts, three of them being Dl Mc Ra 1 . In 303 Thynne's his for a is found in four manuscripts, three of them being Dl Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's odd reading merthe for much in line 349 is found in only five manuscripts, two of them Mc and Ra 1 (and only those two of the five having drynk in the same phrase as does Thynne). In line 375 Thynne's omission of that is matched in only two manuscripts, Mc and Ra 1 . In line 388 Thynne's an easye for esily a is found in only four manuscripts, Dl Mc Ra 2 Ht. Thynne's construction in line 421 that they wept is found only in Ra 2 Ht. In line 458 Thynne's the loue for loue is found in seven manuscripts, among them Dl Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's certes or for er that is found in only Mc Ra 1 for line 468. In line 504 Thynne's Ther for Tho is found in two manuscripts, one of them Ra 1 . For line 516 Thynne prints a spurious line: With his dissymilynge and fayre assemblaunces . This is found only in Dl Mc Ra 1 . In line 520 Thynne's omission of bothe is matched in four manuscripts, among them Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's crowel for crowned in 526 is only in Mc Ra 1 (and Lansdowne 851). In line 545 Thynne's eke for as is found only in Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's as of for of in line 546 is found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 572 Thynne's ne so for ne is found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 610 Thynne's omission of propre is matched in four manuscripts, among them Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's leue for lete is found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 657 Thynne's which I of for of which I is found in only five manuscripts, among them Mc Ra 1 . In line 660, Thynne's of so grete for so greet is found in four manuscripts, among them Mc. Thynne reverses lines 663-664, an arrangement found only in Mc Ra 1 . In line 680 Thynne's perseueraunce for continuaunce is found only in Ht. Thynne's spekyng for speche in line 681 is found only in Ht. In line 693 Thynne's comyn for commune is found only in Ht and Ra 2 . In line 698 Thynne's your for his is found in four manuscripts, among them Ht. In line 706 Thynne's may for wol is found only in Ra 2 . Among the other Thynne variants from the earlier printed editions, one can point to the following lines of interest: 28, 29, 31, 39, 42, 51, 75, 91, 96, 109, 120, 129, 154, 173, 178, 220, 226, 277, 288, 300, 311, 317, 319, 325, 359, 370, 392, 397, 402, 405, 417, 418, 438, 443, 474, 475, 483, 498, 506, 515, 539, 547, 567, 594, 616, 632. These contain variants from the printed editions which are found in a number of manuscripts, sometimes even the majority, but in each case the manuscripts containing the Thynne variants include Dl Mc Ra 1 (line 300 has only Dl of this group among the other manuscripts). From line 75 onwards Ra 2 Ht play an increasing role. In addition to the instances given previously, one can point to line 75, 87 (three manuscripts only, including Ra 2 Ht), 120, 172, 196, 215 (four manuscripts only, two of them being Ra 2 Ht), 226 (only three manuscripts, Mc Ra 1 Ht), 250 (six manuscripts, Dl Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht and Ma), 288, 359 (only six manuscripts, including Ra 2 Ht), 402, 405, 412, 417, 418, 432 (Thynne's doghter this Canace is found in Dl Ra 2 Ht), 438, 443, 483, 498, 506, 508, 563 (Ra 2 Ht only), 567, 632, 676. The reason for some repetition of line numbers is that Dl Mc Ra 1 or a combination of them and Ra 2 Ht are found with the same reading. Of Thynne's 365 variations from the previous printed editions, many of which must in any case have been mere typesetter's errors, 43, which are pretty clearly not such errors, can be traced with some confidence to a manuscript or manuscripts of the Dl Mc Ra 1 type, nine to a manuscript or manuscripts of the Ra 2 Ht type, and 66 others which are found in a number of manuscripts, always including Dl Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht or a combination of the first three and the second pair. One manuscript, Ph 3 , suggested by Koch as a type of the possible source for Thynne's readings in his Canterbury Tales , does appear occasionally among those manuscripts giving Thynne's new readings, for example, lines 120, 173, 438, 459, 475, 690, 701—but never alone, and not with enough consistency to make it a credible candidate for the type of source. In a number of important instances Ph 3 differs from the manuscripts which provide a new Thynne reading, particularly 161, 483, 498, 567, in addition, of course, to those many instances in which Dl Mc Ra 1 or Ra 2 Ht are, among them, the only instances in a manuscript of a new Thynne reading. In view of these facts, and particularly of the spurious line and the reversed lines, can we be confident that we have located the exact manuscript or manuscripts that Thynne used? Unfortunately, no. The Ra 2 Ht readings, though with Dl Mc Ra 1 in the first half of the poem, tend to separate into another stream. And, of course, Ra 2 Ht do not share the spurious line or the reversed lines, yet they would have provided Thynne with some readings that Dl Mc Ra 1 could not have done. In addition, Thynne has a number of readings not found in any manuscript or printed edition, and although some may be errors, they cannot be simply dismissed as such. Thynne's openly se in line 136 may be a typo for openly , or it may be a version of openly telle in Mc Ra 1 . Line 175's and eek the for and the may again be a typo. But Thynne's courser of Poyle (line 195) seems to be a reading from a manuscript; there were many versions of the Apulian courser, for it caused trouble for the scribes from the beginning. Thynne's omission of that in line 231 is perhaps a typo. His hors for cowrser in line 310 may be an error, but it looks a bit like a manuscript reading. In line 407 Thynne's same knotte for knotte seems very much like a manuscript reading. Thynne's in wode eyther in has got the syntax the wrong way about in line 420 and may, of course, be a printer's misreading, but could as easily be a scribal error. In line 472, Thynne's spitously for pitously could easily be either, as could his omission of is in line 519. However, Thynne's in otherwise for that ootherwise seems a reflection of a scribal reading rather than a printer's mistake in line 534. And Thynne's Adam for the firste man in line 552 seems a clear instance of a no-longer extant manuscript reading. Thynne was something of a pedant, but this kind of gratuitous assistance to the reader seems to have been beyond him (another instance of Thynne's presumed editorial intrusion, the reading of client for clerk or cherl in line 140 of the Physician's Tale is less likely the result of Thynne's consulting Livy to get the facts of the story straight than it is Thynne's picking up a marginal gloss—no longer extant—containing a brief phrase from Livy). Thynne's he flye for the slye in line 672 seems to have been a simple scribal misreading, though, of course, it could have originated in the printing room as well. And in line 684 Thynne's now were fallen for right now were falle is simply the dropping of a word either by a scribe or a typesetter. Of Thynne's unique readings, then, at least four, in lines 195, 407, 534 and 552 may well have originated in one of his manuscripts, no longer extant. There are of course many, many instances in which Thynne's text differs from those of the manuscripts Dl Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht. It is clear that he was using a printed copy, perhaps more than one, just as he was clearly using more than one manuscript. But even in the one spectacular instance of his dependence upon a type of Dl Mc Ra 1 , the spurious line at 516, Thynne's version is slightly different; he prints With his dissimulyng and fayre assemblawnce for With ille dissymelynge and fayre assemblawncis , found in Dl Mc Ra 1 . Thynne's his for ille does not seem an obvious sort of misreading. The more probable explanation is another manuscript with this variant of the line. And, of course, Thynne did not follow his manuscripts down every rabbitpath which they presented to him: at line 592 Mc Ra 1 (and presumably a sister manuscript that Thynne might have been using) have another spurious line, at least as good as the first one, which Thynne does not print. The obvious answer, that Thynne was using Dl only, won't do, for the transposition of lines at 663-4 is found only in Mc Ra 1 , not Dl! And there are readings in Thynne not found in the earlier printed editions which are found in only a few other manuscripts: Barlow 20 (Bw), British Library Additional 5140 (Ad 1 ), Bodleian 686 (Bo 2 ), Cardigan (Cn), Devonshire (Ds), Egerton 2726 (En 1 ), Egerton 2863 (En 3 ), Fitzwilliam Mc-Clean 181 (Fi), Cambridge University Ii. 3. 26 (Ii), Harleian 1758 (Ha 2 ), Harleian 7334 (Ha 4 ), Harleian 7335 (Ha 5 ), Lincoln 110=A. 4. 18 (Ln), Manchester English 113 (Ma), Morgan 249 (Mg), Northumberland (Nl), Royal 17 D. XV (Ry 1 ), Trinity College Cambridge R. 3. 3. (Tc 1 ), and Trinity College Oxford Arch. 49 (To), all figure from time to time among very small groups of manuscripts or single manuscripts which provide the same readings as are found in Thynne. Notably, there are En 1 and Ds exclusively in line 10; Bo 2 Ha 5 Ry 1 in 63; Fi with Ra 2 and Ht in 87; Cn Fi To with Ra 2 Ht in 114; Nl only in 122; To only in 136; Nl only in 147; Fi Ln with Ra 2 Ht in 181; Bo 2 and Ry 1 in 305; Ry 1 with four other manuscripts including Mc Ra 1 in 340; Bo 2 Fi only in 454; Ra 1 and Tc 1 in 504; Fi and To with Mc Ra 1 in 520; Ry 1 with Ha 4 Mc Ra 1 in 610; Ry Ha 5 Bw with Mc Ra 1 in 657; Ry 1 Ii with Mc Ma in 660; To Ln Mg with Ht and Ra 2 in 676; En 3 Fi Ii Ph 3 Ad 1 in 690; Nl with Bw Ha 2 and Ht in 698; Fi Ha 2 Bw with Dl in 708. Three unique manuscript readings matching those of Thynne, two in Nl and one in To, are not much to draw conclusions from. What we know of the provenance of Dl Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht is not very helpful in determining whether precisely these manuscripts might have been available for Thynne. 9 We do know, of course, that Urry and the Thomas brothers made use of Dl for the Urry edition. 10 It is within the bounds of possibility that Thynne actually had one of Mc Ra 1 and one of Ra 2 Ht and perhaps even Dl to call upon, the other eccentricities being explained by errors on the part of typesetters, corrections by Thynne, and the consultation with still further manuscripts for the Squire's Tale . But for the reasons given above I think it not proven that Thynne made extended use of these extant manuscripts. Nevertheless it seems clear to me that he made extended use for the Squire's Tale of at least two manuscripts, one very, very close to Dl Mc Ra 1 and the other equally close to Ra 2 Ht. And, I may add that my study of Thynne's printing of the Squire's Tale has convinced me that the description of manuscript affiliations given by Manly and Rickert (II, 288-297) for that tale are in the main correct. That Thynne used manuscripts similar to those I have discussed seems now clear. A remaining question is: what text or texts did he use? Tyrwhitt (I, xl) suggested the second Caxton; Skeat suggested the first; 11 W. W. Greg (pp. 757-759) argued for WN; and Blodgett (p. 47) has suggested either Pynson edition—these suggestions generally for the Canterbury Tales as a whole, based upon quite select studies as of Greg ( Knight's Tale ) and Blodgett ( Canon's Yeoman's Tale ), or upon impressions as in the cases of Tyrwhitt and Skeat. So we are left with a free field, all earlier editions having been suggested by one or another prominent scholar. For the Squire's Tale , however, I believe that the first Caxton (CX 1 ) can be safely ruled out as Thynne's copy. Although the first Caxton alone among the early printed editions gives the Squire's Tale-Merchant's Tale link and arrangement that Thynne used, I do not believe that that is enough to indicate any other than a very general use of the first Caxton. Thynne certainly knew it, of course, but the arrangement of the Squire's Tale-Merchant's Tale could as well come from Thynne's manuscript or manuscripts: as it happens, Mc and Ra 1 , incomplete manuscripts, do not have the Merchant's Tale and are out for the link, but Dl has the link with the reading "Merchaunt" for "Frankeleyn" and the Merchant's Tale following, as do both Ra 2 and Ht (Manly and Rickert, VI, 502, 570). But the first Caxton commits 136 errors which are corrected by the second edition; it is out for lines 554-557, and transposes lines 183-184, none of which had any effect upon Thynne's edition. Thynne prints a CX 1 reading (which had been corrected by CX 2 ) on only eleven occasions, and all but one of these readings are also found in manuscripts Dl Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht. The CX 2 in addition to its corrections of CX 1 contributes 14 new variants of its own, but is an excellent text for the Squire's Tale . The first Pynson contributes 51 variants of its own, 31 of which do not appear in any other printed edition. There are 19 which appear in no manuscript or earlier printed edition, but which are corrected by PN 2 : 73, 177, 211, 220, 253, 262, 275, 277, 331, 334, 339, 340, 568, 601, 605, 609, 640, 650, 689. The high number of oddities in PN 1 , especially the readings not found in manuscripts, and the fact they did not affect Thynne, would seem to argue strongly against consideration of PN 1 as one of Thynne's texts. WN adds 15 variants of its own not found in the earlier editions, including five not found in manuscripts: 216, 319, 435, 461, 487. WN is also out for line 23. PN 2 , on the other hand, adds only one variant of its own, at line 44, where the only manuscript support is found in Cambridge University Library Gg. 4. 27. It corrects PN 1 as we have seen, and is very close to WN, but ignores 12 of WN's new variants. But where it follows WN in a variant, as in line 689, TH usually follows. In conclusion, since Thynne introduces 365 new readings to the printed editions, it is obviously difficult to be certain of a copy for the text of a poem that runs only to 700 lines. But we have seen that CX 1 is almost certainly out of consideration, as is PN 1 . CX 2 , WN and PN 2 remain as candidates, my own instinct favoring PN 2 with consultation with both CX 2 and WN. 12 By no means all of Thynne's 365 new readings are now accepted as "correct"; but by the simple expedient of looking at several manuscripts in addition to his one or more printed texts, he consistently improved the text of the Squire's Tale , and the evidence solidifies Thynne's claim to be the first true editor of the Canterbury Tales , as opposed to being a printer of them.</field>

It is perhaps worth quoting Greg's summary about the relation of the printed editions to one another (760-761): Caxton printed his first edition from a manuscript closely resembling . . . Tt 2 [Trinity College Cambridge R. 3. 15 or Manly's Tc 2 ] . . . His second edition he printed from his first after it had been extensively altered by comparison with another manuscript whose affinities cannot be determined. Pynson printed his first edition from a copy of Caxton's second in which certain readings had been introduced from manuscript of whose nature we know nothing. Pynson's second edition was printed from his first, but the copy used had beeen collated with Caxton's second . . . and a few readings introduced from a manuscript possibly of the Petworth group. Wynkyn de Worde printed his edition from Caxton's second, and it is probable that he too had recourse to some manuscript source. . . . Lastly Thynne's edition was printed by Godfray from that of de Worde, extensive alterations being again made by comparison with a manuscript. This manuscript may have been closely related to one now extant . . . [Phillipps 8137 or Ph 3 ] . . . which is classed as belonging to the Petworth group . . . and it is quite likely that more than one manuscript was used. 2 J.

The first eight lines, now called the Squire's Prologue , were out in the b family texts which Caxton printed and were not printed until Tyrwhitt; they were also out in Mc Ra 1 Ra 2 Ht, and were present only in the seven-line stanza form as the Franklin's Headlink in D1. Thynne naturally followed his printed copies and manuscripts. 8 The Text of the Canterbury Tales, Studied on the Basis of All Known Manuscripts (1940), I, 451.

Which I haue ryght dilygently serched in many dyuers places" is paraphrased by Thynne: "There can be founde no more of this fore sayd tale / whiche hath been sought in dyuers places."

      <field name="heading_text">The Relevance of Cast-Off Copy in Determining the Nature of Omissions: Q2 Hamlet by Eric Rasmussen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Confronted with the problematic omissions in the First Folio text of Hamlet , Sir Walter Greg admitted that "it is not always easy to distinguish between accident and design." 1 It is, however, one of the primary tasks of a bibliographer, particularly when dealing with texts which exist in multiple early editions, to determine the nature of omissions. One must decide whether a passage present in one edition but absent from another was accidentally omitted by the compositor or was intentionally left out—cancelled by a censor or by a revising hand (authorial or otherwise). Critical analysis of such omissions has generally concentrated on the contextual rather than the bibliographical—concerned with the content of the omission rather than the physical traces which the presence of its absence has left in the text. This brief note will suggest a new methodological approach for bibliographically distinguishing between accidental and intentional omissions in texts which were set by formes. In his seminal studies which demonstrated that the Shakespeare First Folio was set by formes and that the copy must have been "cast-off," Charlton Hinman also concluded that the First Folio printers were not very adept in their casting-off technique. 2 In the casting-off process the compositor had to calculate precisely how much of his copy would be needed to fill each page (by counting words and making computations according to the sizes of type and page.) 3 If the compositor made an error in his calculations, he might reach the end of his stint with too little copy and be forced to fill out his page using such expedients as setting prose as verse or breaking verse lines. Hinman notes a number of these expedients which he classifies as "devices by which compositors were able to compensate for inaccurate casting-off and to accomodate, as it were, the copy to its allotted space." 4 However, Hinman's contention that the Folio printers "frequently misjudged" 5 must be tempered by the realization that another factor would also necessitate such expedients: an accidental omission. Assuming that by accurately casting-off, the compositor had predetermined the exact number of lines which could comfortably fit into a given quire, if the compositor accidentally omitted five lines of his copy, he would then arrive at the end of his stint five lines short, and would have to fill his page as best he could. The presence or absence of page-filling expedients at the end of a compositor's stint may be of use in distinguishing accidental omissions from intended ones. Since passages marked for omission in the copy would not be counted in the initial casting-off calculation, their omission would have no effect on the amount of copy the compositor had allotted for each page. Passages accidentally omitted, however, would have been initially counted and their omission would affect the compositor's ability to fill his page with the copy he had allotted for it. Thus, the fact that the end of a compositor's stint appears to be filled out is not necessarily an indication of sloppy casting-off—rather, and perhaps more importantly, it may indicate that a passage was accidentally omitted from that stint. This theory may now be applied to a short omission in Folio Hamlet . The Second Quarto contains 2½ lines which are absent from the Folio text: 6 Q2: Polo . Hath my Lord wroung from me my slowe leaue By laboursome petition, and at last Vpon his will I seald my hard consent, I doe beseech you giue him leaue to goe. (sig. B4-B4v) F: Pol . He hath my Lord: I do beseech you giue him leaue to go. (sig. nn5v TLN 238-239) The Folio omission occurs on nn5v, the last page in Compositor B's stint. When B arrived at the end of nn5v he was three lines short, so had to expand three lines from Q2 into six Folio lines in order to fill his page: Q2: Ham . I am glad to see you well; Horatio , or I do forget my selfe. Hora . The same my Lord, and your poore seruant euer. Ham . Sir my good friend, Ile change that name with you, (sig. C1v) F: Ham . I am glad to see you well: Horatio , or I do forget my selfe. Hor . The same my Lord, And your poore Seruant euer. Ham . Sir my good friend, Ile change that name with you: (sig. nn5v TLN 346-351) The fact that there is a 2½ line omission in a page which comes up 3 lines short may be pure coincidence. But when this is combined with additional evidence, 7 it seems nearly certain that the omission was not intentional, that the lines stood in the folio copy, that they were counted when the quire was cast-off, and that their accidental omission caused Compositor B to come up three lines short at the end of his stint. This method of distinguishing between accidental and intentional omissions cannot, of course, be applied to all texts. But, as the example of Folio Hamlet demonstrates, this method of analysis can be useful in determining the nature of omissions in texts set by formes.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop by Antony Hammond</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preamble Although The White Devil 1 is one of Webster's most frequently-edited plays, very little original bibliographical work has been done on it since the late Philip Williams's article in the first issue of this publication. 2 In this, Williams, whose primary interest was in the composition of King Lear , attempted to compare the work done on the Shakespeare play with that on two other plays also set in Nicholas Okes's shop, one of which was The White Devil . He identified two compositors who were working for Okes at that time; his study of their habits in The White Devil indicated that Compositor A, with certain exceptions, used terminal -y rather than -ie, generally used the apostrophe in the form 'I'le' and was "predisposed" to the form 'do'. B, on the other hand, frequently used -ie rather than -y, never used the apostrophe in 'Ile', and had a "marked preference" for 'doe'. On the basis of this evidence, Williams assigned B1 r-v , C1 r -F2 v , G1 r -2 v , H2 4-v , H4 r-v , I3 r-v , I4 v , K1 r , K3 v -4 v , L3 r -M2 v to Compositor A, and B2 r -4 v , F3 r -4 v , G3 r -4 v , H1 r-v , H3 r-v , I1 r -2 v , I4 r , K1 v -3 r , L1 r -2 v to Compositor B. John Russell Brown, in his Revels Plays edition, comments that the spellings 'here/heere', terminal -e or -ee and initial -en or -in, confirm Williams's division. But he does not tabulate the evidence, 3 and makes no mention of it in his articles for SB . 4 Some of Williams's assumptions have been queried, 5 and some of his determinations will be challenged in the present article. However, it should be acknowledged that when Williams did his work, the art of compositor-determination was in its infancy, and any defects of his survey may be attributed to this fact. However, it is high time that the work was done afresh. Williams surveyed only the three spellings indicated, and failed to distinguish between prose and verse. 6 Nor, naturally, could he make any use of the more sophisticated discriminators which subsequent investigators have employed. The results of such a new survey are embodied in this article, the research for which was undertaken as part of the textual editing of the forthcoming Cambridge edition of the Works of John Webster. 7 I propose to deal with three questions crucial to the composition of The White Devil . First, what is the effect upon compositor-determination of the physical setting of the type? Secondly, do spelling-preferences and other discriminators allow us to identify the compositors with any greater certainty than Williams and Brown achieved? Thirdly, what information can be derived from a detailed examination of the way type was set from case to forme and distributed thence again? The other possible aspects of such study, namely what light the investigation of printing may shed upon the nature of the manuscript used by the compositors, and the proof-reading and press-correction of the play, were examined by Brown in detail; his investigations in this area (in his edition and in the articles mentioned) hold up satisfactorily, and although they will be addressed in the Textual Introduction to the forthcoming edition, will not be resumed here. Basically, Williams's identification of A and B is shown to be sound in gatherings F-L inclusive (with the relatively minor changes that I2 v must be assigned to A, and that L2 v turns out to be shared between the two compositors). However, the evidence described below weakens Williams's assignment of the greater part of gatherings B-E inclusive to A, and disproves his assignation of B2 r -4 v to B. It has therefore become necessary to postulate another workman as the compositor of gatherings B-E. In order to retain the initials of "A" and "B" for the majority of the book (and thereby, I hope, cause as little confusion as possible to readers of Brown's edition), I have designated this workman "Compositor N". Neither A nor B seem to have been the workmen for much of gathering M; and evidence to assign gathering A simply does not exist. The compositor-distribution then which I have arrived at, and which this article gives the evidence for, is as follows: Compositor N: B1 r -E4 v . Compositor A: F1 r -F2 v * , G1 r -2 v , H2 r-v , H4 r-v , I2 v -3 v , I4 v , K1 r , K3 v -4 v , L3 r -4 v , M2 v . Compositor B: F2 v ** -4 v , G3 r -4 v , H1 r-v , H3 r-v , I1 r -2 r , I4 r , K1 v -3 r , L1 r -2 r . Shared between A and B: L2 v . Unassigned (Compositor C?): M1 r -2 r A1 r -2 v .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part One: The Type-Line Perhaps the single most important distinction to be drawn in attempting a new compositor-analysis is between passages set in verse, and those in prose. Unfortunately, this distinction is not as easy to draw as might appear at first glance. D. F. McKenzie has demonstrated that "indenting the stick" was a common way of aiding justification of verse lines in plays of this period. 8 Examination of The White Devil shows clearly that this method was used extensively. The evidence is a little tedious to resume, but as it has a bearing on the compositor-analysis, it will be necessary to do so. The stick was set at 23 ems, giving an approximate line-length of 96 mm. The usual short line, or indented line, was 19 ems, about 77-78 mm. Naturally these metric figures vary depending on the amount of shrinkage in the sheet of paper as it dried, but the use of a block 4 ems wide was clearly the handiest way of achieving an indentation and thus saving quantities of quads. An examination of The White Devil reveals that in far more pages than McKenzie found in Lear , some such aid to justification was employed. In the following tabulation, "prose" is to be taken to mean that there is some prose on the page, not that the entire page is prose; there are some pages in the play wholly in prose—B3 v and B4 r are instances—but usually the page will contain a mixture. The following pages show no abnormalities: B1 v , C1 r , C1 v , C4 r , D1 v , D2 r , D4 r , G4 r , M1 v ; in addition, the following pages show no abnormalities other than that they contain prose: B1 r , B4 r , B4 v , E2 r , F2 v , G3 v , I2 v , K2 r , K2 v , K4 v , L1 r , M2 v . These pages have therefore been excluded from the Table. Thus, of the 84 pages of text in the play, only 21 reveal no sign whatever of adjustment of the width of the type-line, or of some greater or lesser anomaly in connexion with line-widths. Table 1 Line Widths If "prose" is not indicated, the page contains verse exclusively. The signs '+' and '-' after the number of ems indicate a line slightly longer or shorter than the norm, the difference almost certainly owing to variation in shrinkage of paper rather than to a re-setting of the stick. Where lines have to be turned up or down at the end, this is noted; "optional" means that the compositor had the choice whether to go up or down; "forced" means he lacked such a choice as the line above or below as the case may be was already full. "s-d" means stage-direction; "cw" means catchword. B2 r 23+ ems, prose. B2 v 23+ ems, prose. B3 r 23 ems, prose. The top of the page is some 3 mm. wider than the foot. B3 v 23 ems, prose. The top of the page is some 3 mm. wider than the foot. C2 r S-d line 7 set flush to 19 ems, also line 9. C2 v Up to line 24 only one line longer than 19; 2 s-ds also flush to 19. C3 r Line 8 s-d flush to 19; only 2 lines on page longer (line 34, almost full-measure, and tightly-spaced, and line 36). At lines 16-17 there is an inked mark at the 19 em point which looks like the edge of a block. Immediately above there is a damaged period. C3 v Line 13 only long line in first two-thirds of page; last five letters are disranged (as is final "r" of "thunder", line 17). C4 v Block of verse, lines 16-23, justified to 19 ems; lines 28-31 justified to 18 ems—an obligatory question-mark omitted in line 30. D1 r Cf. C3 v ; last two words of line 9 disranged, break at c. 19 ems. In lines 15-24 five lines are justified to 19 ems, and only three lines on the page are longer than 19 ems. However, one of them (line 17) breaks the 19-em sequence in lines 15-24, so that quads rather than a block must have been used for justification. D2 v 23+ ems, prose (but s-d in line 11 set flush to 19 ems). D3 r S-d in line 11 set flush to 19 ems. A mark of something inking is visible opposite lines 29-33; there are two ampersands used in line 30. D3 v Something left an ink mark straggling over five lines or so in the top right corner, perhaps the irregular face of a large block improperly seated. At line 25 an exit-direction is set to 19 ems, and the line above, and lines 26, 28, 29 following are justified to 19 ems, as is line 36. D4 v There is an ink-mark at the 23 em line opposite lines 20-23; lines 20-21 are justified to 19 ems, but the surrounding lines are shorter. There are inking spaces in the bottom left corner. E1 r There is a turn-up at line 34 (an 18-syllable line!) which could easily have been avoided if the compositor had re-arranged the s-d at lines 24-25 to fit on a single line, for which there was ample room. The s-d at line 20, however, is set flush to 19 ems though lines in the vicinity are longer. E1 v 23+ ems, prose. E2 v 23 ems, but there is serious misalignment in line 5, the break occurring at the 19 em point; the s-d above is similarly affected, from which it is possible to infer the use of a block, imperfectly squared, to the right of lines 6-10. The second line of the s-d at lines 1-2 ends 3 mm short of flush-right, in order to give it a roughly "centred" appearance. E3 r 23 ems. As on previous page, the s-d ends on line 10, 3 mm short. E3 v No line longer than 19 ems until line 24; lines 6, 8, 10 justified to 19 ems. E4 r Line 6 turned up (optional). E4 v Only three lines longer than 19 ems; lines 3, 6, 8, 18, 21, 36(s-d) are justified to that width, none exceptionally tightly. F1 r First half of page 19 ems; lines 2, 11, 13, 19 justified to that width; last sixteen lines are longer, including two (34, 37) full-measure; line 34 is turned down. There is an ink-mark at 23 ems opposite line 5. F1 v Here the upper half of the page has longer lines (none full-measure), and the lower shorter. There is some evidence that an imperfect 5 em block was used, since the last letter of line 23, and the period at the end of line 25, which both slightly exceed 18 ems, seem to have slipped. Lines 34 and 37 are also set to 18 ems. F2 r Lines 2, 10, 11, 18 set to 19 ems. F3 r S-ds at line 23 and line 34 indented 2.5 and 3.5 ems respectively; 28 is on the same line as dialogue; 34 has its own line but is not centred and is incomplete anyway; it reads Enter the French ; the word Ambassador is missing. F3 v Line 28 exit s-d set to 20 ems, as is line 29. A 4 X 3 em block would fill the gap nicely. F4 r S-d at line 34 is set an en-space short of flush-right, in a line where the dialogue approaches the direction closely. F4 v Much seems to be set to 19 ems: lines 1-3, 11, 16, 17, 22, 24-25, 28 are justified to this width, including s-ds in lines 25 and 28; line 11 is especially tightly punctuated, and lines 16-17 tightly squeezed. Only lines 4, 5 and 31 are longer than 19 ems: 4 is set to 22; 5 to 20, and 31 to 21 ems, indicating that these lines were also justified. G1 r Three lines full-measure, all showing inking shoulders (3, 5, 18). Three lines (20, 22, 28) are justified to 19+ ems; in 28 the spacing is extremely tight, a tilde is used, and the usual en-space preceding a speech-prefix at the beginning of a line is reduced to a mid-space. Something is inking against the outer edge of the lower half of the page, perhaps a really big, narrow block turned sideways—which would account for the reluctance to re-justify line 28. G1 v All set to a maximum of 19 ems, including two s-ds, except the cw. G2 r Several lines justified to 19 ems, including the s-d at line 36. Except the cw, no line is justified to 23 ems; even line 10, which contains an exit-direction, is not set to that measure. A small piece of ?inverted type (not pica) has left an impression at the 23-em point in line 28. G2 v All 19 ems, save lines 30, 37 (and cw); lines 22, 24, 28 have s-ds justified at 19 ems, but no lines are particularly tight. There is a mark opposite lines 11-12 in the outer margin. G3 r 23 ems. Two s-ds, lines 7 and 12, set respectively 13.5 and 15 mm short of flush-right. G4 v Ink-marks in lower right corner, no sign of any special justification. H1 r 23 ems; no real sign of 19 ems; line 20 however is very tight, abbreviated by use of a tilde and ampersand (though a VV for W occurs at the beginning—an upper-case W occurs eleven lines below), yet there seems to be ample space for a turn-under. So perhaps a block was used to fill out lines 21-27. H1 v 23 ems; there is a forced turn-up at line 22. No sign of 19 ems. H2 r 23 ems, prose; a rule or reglet is inking at top right. H2 v A s-d located to the right of lines 9-12 has its left margin justified at 19 ems, the right margin is irregular. H3 r The compositors liked to squeeze a whole verse line into a single line of type wherever possible. Note, in consequence, the problems encountered in lines 1-4 on this page: Ser. Vittoria my Lord. Fran. Wel: what of her ? Ser. Is fled the Citty,Fra.Ha ? Ser. With Duke Brachiano . Fra.Fled?Where's the Prince Ser. Gone with his father. Giouanni Only line 3 would not have fit 23 ems, a thing the compositor might not have noticed at line 1. The consequent mislineation reveals clearly the workman's reluctance to re-set botched work. There is also an optional turn-down at line 15, and a s-d justified to 19 ems at line 25. H3 v 23 ems, no sign of 19 ems. However, the register of the first few lines (1 and 2 are filled out with a s-d) is disturbed at about the 20 em point, disturbance which can also be seen in lines 6 and 9. This suggests movement of a block below line 9. H4 r 23 ems, several lines set to 19 ems; turn-up (optional) at line 20. H4 v 23 ems, prose; the last 8 lines do not exceed 19 ems. I1 r 23— ems. Lines 6-21 are all less than 19 ems except for the last letter of line 20, which is either damaged or out of register. The s-d at lines 23-24 ends 8 and 13.5 mm short of flush-right. I1 v 23— ems, prose. S-d lines 9-10 ends on line 10, 8 mm short of flush; s-d lines 11-12 ends on line 11 10 mm short; the direction would have fit on line 11. I2 r 23— ems, prose. S-d lines 28-29 begins on 28, 2 mm short, ends on a line of its own, 9 mm short (and obviously, since 29 has nothing else in it, could have been entirely accommodated in 29). I3 r 23— ems, prose. In line 24, the second line of a s-d is 2 mm short. I3 v 23— ems, prose. S-d at line 19 is 1 mm short of full-measure. I4 r 23— ems, prose. The s-d at lines 11-13 ends 8.5, 11.5 and 15 mm respectively short of flush. The direction would have fit on two lines if it had been flushed. Similarly, a direction beginning in line 18, five lines long, has one line (21) 4 mm short of flush. I4 v 23— ems. S-d lines 15-16: line 16 ends 8 mm short of flush. K1 r 23 ems, prose. Something is inking in the top-right corner, where the longest line is 20 ems. There is a fairly clear impression of an en-space at the end of line 9. K1 v 23 ems, prose. S-d, line 7, set 2 mm short of flush; line 23 9.5 mm short (but this direction has been "centred", cf. E2 v ). K3 r 23 ems; an optional turn-up, line 4; a s-d set to about 20 ems, line 14. K3 v 23 ems; only one full-measure line (11, including a s-d); ten lines justified to 19 ems, including a s-d, line 13. There is an ink-mark in the lower right corner, opposite line 31. K4 r 23 ems; four lines justified to 19 ems, nothing longer than that measure between line 9 and line 26. An em-quad inks in the direction-line. L1 v 23 ems; s-ds set flush right; one turn-down (forced), line 15 (this occurs in a passage alternating between verse and prose, which even John Russell Brown mislines: prose begins at line 13 and continues until the beginning of the dirge). L2 r 23 ems, but only one full-measure line; s-d line 2 set to 21 ems, line 36 to 20 ems. One line (28) set to 19 ems. L2 v No line full-measure; 8 lines set to 19 ems, including 5 lines between 27 and 37; line 37 is abbreviated, employing a tilde, to make it fit. There is also a misprint in line 33 ("the" for "they") which may have been the compositor's unconscious response to his realizing that the line was going to be tight. L3 r 23 ems, but four lines justified to 19 ems. L3 v 23— ems; much of page is short, but only lines 14 and 36 set to 19 ems. L4 r 23 ems, prose; lines 4-5 set to 19 ems. L4 v 23 ems, prose; line 1 is spread out, to 21 ems, perhaps to match line 2, the same measure, but tightly set; there is a disarrangement in the near-full line 9 also at about the 20 em mark; lines 6, 11-12 are set to 19 ems; line 36 turned down (optional). M1 r 23 ems but only two lines, and direction-line, full width. No sign of 19 ems. M2 r 23 ems, prose; one s-d justified to 22 ems. One of the most curious features to emerge from this survey is the practice of ending a stage-direction short of the flush-right margin. The practice is to be found on the following pages: F3 r , F4 r , G3 r , H2 v ?, I1 r , I1 v , I2 r , I3 r , I3 v , I4 r , I4 v , K1 v , L1 v , L4 v ?, M2 r . The instances on H2 v and L4 v should perhaps be excluded, as the left margins of the directions on these pages are flush, so a different aesthetic principle is at work. For the same reasons, the directions on E2 v and E3 r are excluded, as the idea there seems to have been to centre the second line below the first. The other instances listed are clearly idiosyncratic, but they occur in both Compositor A's and Compositor B's work. Prior to F3 r , entry directions were centred in their own line, or set flush-right. Exits are flush-right, as are descriptive directions—always allowing that "flush-right" means to the extent of the available space—i.e. 23 ems, or 19 ems, or sometimes some other figure. The emergence of a new way of treating directions in the middle of the play must be considered significant, especially as the commonest indentations (such as 8 mm) are not multiples of em- or en-spaces. The likeliest explanation is that it is a sign that the composition passed to other workmen than the compositor who had set the first four gatherings. Some other typographical features of the quarto might be mentioned here. One such is the extremely heavy impression made by the headline and direction-line. It is relatively easy to see how the bottom of the pages could be over-impressed by a press with a warped platen (incidentally, there is no sign of this effect in the Pide Bull quarto of King Lear ), but it is hard to see why the headline should be thus affected. For the record, spaces ink at the bottom of the page on B2 v , 3 r , 4 r ; C1 r , 2 r , 3 r , 4 v (i.e. the outer forme of C); D1 v , 3 r , 4 r ; E2 v , 3 r , 4 r ; F1 v , 2 v , 3 r , 4 r ; G1 r , 2 v , 3 v , 4 r , 4 v ; H1 v , 2 v , 3 r , 4 r ; I1 r , 2 v , 3 r , 4 r ; K1 r , 3 r , 4 v ; L1 v , 2 r , 3 v , 4 r ; M1 r . The shoulder of a type also inks on line 35 on C4 v . Naturally there is variation between copies, but this list represents the consensus of the three in the British Library. The effect this over-impression has on the determination of the skeletons will be mentioned below, in Part III. The conclusion to be drawn from this investigation is that the use of blocks to fill out the stick, thereby saving quads, was common in the setting of this play. To the several instances of concrete evidence of this practice—the places where a block has left inked traces—we may add several very plausible inferences, where a line is set very tightly to 19 ems. Consequently, it is probably safe to assume that this method was used wherever convenient. In places blocks of other sizes seem to have been used, but it is not always possible to tell where a line was set to a predetermined length thanks to the presence of a block in the stick, and where upon imposition it was found possible to remove a large number of em-quads by inserting a block in their place. The difference between the two methods is crucial. It has long been accepted, in compositor-study, that prose and verse are apples and oranges that cannot be directly compared nor mixed together to produce composite statistics. When a compositor sets a verse line, he will (so it is assumed) set a standard space between words, follow his habitual preferences in spelling and punctuation and the use of spaces, and then at the end of the line simply fill up the stick with the necessary spaces to justify the line. 9 In prose, by contrast, while the compositor may indeed follow his spelling preferences, he may also be induced to sacrifice some or all of them to the process of justification. His "verse-habits" of spacing will necessarily be abandoned, since spacing between words is the principal method of justification. Hence data drawn from prose setting is suspect, and most investigators either eliminate it from their analyses, or classify it separately. However, it is clear from this study of the indentation of the stick in The White Devil that a substantial number of verse lines were justified as if they were prose: that is, the final character in the line comes hard against the right margin. This is true not only for full-measure (23-em) verse lines, which are easy to see, but for a number of lines set to 18, 19 (chiefly), 20, sometimes 21 ems. Indeed there seems to be something of a preference for justifying a line of verse to a specified number of ems if it exceeded 19 ems. But this is merely an impression, impossible to substantiate. What, then, has happened to our verse-line, supposedly the norm for compositor-determination? It has become a much less certain guide, one which is no longer easy to spot. The text must be gone through carefully (bearing the imponderables of paper-shrinkage in mind) to determine which lines are actually justified to a short measure; these lines must be removed from the "verse" count, and placed with the prose. The conclusion that one must come to is that far more of The White Devil is "prose" than a glance would suggest. This has been carefully borne in mind in the subsequent section of this article. But even in such "prose" lines one can frequently find the compositor retaining some of his more cherished habits. And the bibliographer's life has become harder again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Two: The Compositors 1. Punctuation . Attempts have been made to show that Webster deliberately punctuated his manuscript in order to supply directions to the actors. 10 This notion, pretty unlikely anyway (the prompt-book and parts would have been made up by the book-keeper or his scribe, neither of them particularly likely to cherish Webster's foul-papers punctuation), is proved false by a detailed examination of the Quarto's punctuation. Altogether, not counting punctuation in the headline, the catchword, or that following a speech-prefix, there are used in the text of The White Devil 1476 periods (including 205 black-letter periods), 2043 commas, 245 semicolons, 237 colons (including italic), 92 exclamation marks (including italic) and 291 question marks (including italic). This is light punctuation for a play of over 3000 lines; it works out to fewer than three punctuation marks per two lines. Even so, as experience of contemporary dramatic manuscripts tells us, it is probably a good deal more than was in the holograph. However, more detailed investigation turns up a most surprising fact. Between B1 r and E4 v , the total quantity of punctuation is 1496 items for the 1182 lines, 1.27 punctuation marks per line. From F1 r to the end of the play, there are 2879 punctuation marks in 1923 lines, or 1.5 per line. This is a statistically significant change. More important, the character of the punctuation changes, as the following short tabulation of the number of specific punctuation marks per page will illustrate. The first three columns list respectively the minimum number of each punctuation mark occurring on each page, the maximum, and the average for each page of the text of the play. Columns 4-6 give the same breakdown of figures for the 32 pages B1 r -E4 v ; the numbers in brackets in column 4 indicate the total number of pages in this part of the book entirely lacking the punctuation mark in question. Columns 7-9 break down the figures for F1 r -M2 v . These figures do not distinguish between italic and roman ; : ! ? or between roman and black-letter periods, since there is nothing to suggest that the compositors were doing anything other than picking up the first sort that came to hand, from cases where the punctuation sorts had besome somewhat disorderly. minimum maximum average B1 r -E4 v min. max. average F1 r -M2 v min. max. average . 7 28 17.5 7 24 14.44 11 28 19.33 , 8 56 24.32 9 56 27.34 8 39 22.46 ; 0 14 2.92 0 (14) 4 0.78 0 (3) 14 4.23 : 0 8 2.82 0 (4) 5 1.78 0 (4) 8 3.46 ! 0 5 1.095 0 (24) 3 0.31 0 (12) 5 1.58 ? 0 17 3.46 0 (9) 10 2.09 0 (5) 17 4.31 The semi-colon is used only 25 times up to E4 v , and 14 pages lack it altogether; from F1 r on it is used 5.4 times as often: 220 occurrences altogether, and only three pages are without one. There is significant variation in frequency of use of other marks: the exclamation mark is used 5.1 times as often; the question mark 2.1 times, the colon 1.9, and the period 1.34 times as often (this last being more significant than it seems, in view of the numbers involved). However, the use of the comma drops by nearly a fifth, to 0.82 times as frequently. Both compositors A and B use this "new" punctuation for the remainder of the play without much statistically significant difference. Table 2 assigns 22 pages to Compositor B and 25 to Compositor A (some of them doubtful); L2 v is not included in the count since it was almost certainly shared between the two compositors, and gathering M cannot be reliably assigned to either. In B's pages, the semi-colon is used altogether 106 times, or 4.8 times per page; in A's, it is used 97 times, or 3.9 times per page. The other punctuation marks follow a similar pattern: B uses 61 colons, 2.77 per page; A 82, 3.24 per page. B uses 43 exclamation marks, an average of 1.95; A uses 36, an average of 1.44 per page. The question-mark is used 110 times by B, or 5.0 per page; A's figures are 112, 4.48 per page. These averages are not identical (nor in view of the variety of the copy could they be expected to be), but they inhabit a different statistical world from the averages in column 6 of the table above. Various hypotheses may be advanced to account for these observations, but none is as persuasive as the likeliest and simplest: that two new compositors took over at the beginning of gathering F from the workman who had set B-E. 2. Terminal punctuation of speeches . There are 43 speeches in the Quarto of The White Devil which end with no punctuation at all, (or where the terminal punctuation is in the associated stage-direction only). Although it is possible to argue that absence of punctuation within a speech is merely a sign of rhetorical rather than grammatical punctuation, it is hard to think that there should be nothing at all at the end of a speech. There are also 75 speeches in Q1 of The White Devil which end with a comma, a colon, or a semi-colon. Some of these may, perhaps, employ the mark in order to indicate that the speaker is interrupted, but by no means all. A few times a speech lacking punctuation is followed by a stage-direction which ends in a stop, but this is only occasionally the case, in B4 v , C1 v , and I1 r for instance. 25 of the unpunctuated sentences and 50 of those terminating with a irregular punctuation occur up to E4 v ; the figures for the remainder of the play are 17 unpunctuated, and 25 with another mark: clearly, a much lower proportion than in the earlier part of the play. Of these 42 irregular sentences in F1 r -M2 v , we find, in the pages assigned to A, 6 which end with nothing and 15 with a comma or other irregular punctuation; in those assigned to B, 10 with nothing and 7 irregular, leaving 4 in unassigned pages. This would rather suggest that B was more prone to omit the punctuation mark altogether than A, who in turn was more likely to use a comma to end a speech than B. B-E4 v has an average of 0.81 unpunctuated and 1.56 irregularly punctuated speeches per page; Compositor A's figures from F1 r on are 0.24 and 0.6. The proportion of unpunctuated to irregularly punctuated sentences in Compositor A's pages is 1:2.5; that in B-E4 v is 1:1.92. Collectively, these studies of punctuation go far to establishing that the compositor of B-E4 v was a different workman from the two compositors Williams identified as A and B. I think it fair to conclude that Webster's MS. must have had very defective or irregular punctuation, with which each compositor did his best, with variable success. 3. Compositor-analysis by spacing . Presence or absence of spacing in conjunction with punctuation has become a new tool in compositor-identification in the last few years. It has been recognized that, especially in a Quarto, the number of words revealing idiosyncratic spellings on any given page may be far too few to permit a reliable identification, especially of compositors whose habits are quite close. It seemed that the investigation of a wholly mechanical parameter, such as whether the compositor used a space after a comma, or before a colon, would be a much more reliable way of amassing the kind of objective evidence in quantities that would be statistically significant. However, the malleus bibliographici of our time, Professor D. F. McKenzie, has recently contrived to cast grave doubt on the validity of such an assumption. 11 With evil and puckish delight, McKenzie sets up a case where it looks utterly clear that analysis of spaced commas will determine the compositors, only to demonstrate from irrefutable external evidence in the Cambridge University Press's archives that the spacing evidence tells us nothing whatever about who set what, and that a compositor would space commas on one page, and not space them on another, with a fine abandon. He insists that the burden of proof is upon those who would wish to claim that practices in a commercial London printing house a hundred years earlier were different from those of the Cambridge compositors. Where, then, does this leave the bibliographer with no such external evidence? In a word, in a situation of healthy scepticism and caution. What I have assumed in this article is that if discriminators agree (for instance if we find on one page that a compositor spells -ie and also usually spaces before a colon in verse, where on another page the usual spelling is -y, and the colon does not have a space before it) then the likelihood increases that these are the practices of two distinct workmen. The more discriminators that coincide, the stronger the supposition, but one must be clear that such suppositions are never more than that, and that virtually any pattern of apparently habitual composition practice can be susceptible to some alternative explanation. Nor am I in a postion to argue that Okes's men were different in their habits from those at the Cambridge University Press a century later. It seems to me that it is not unlikely that they were, but the evidence to prove it does not exist. I must reiterate that I speak only of spacing in association with punctuation. It is not yet within the scope of bibliographical knowledge to ascertain the number and kind of spaces a compositor used routinely between words to space them and to justify his lines. Nor do I believe that such information will ever become available. With these reasonable cautions in mind, let us see what an examination of spacing with punctuation in The White Devil can yield. The results are found in Table 2 below, but may be summarized here. The first column lists the number of cases in which the compositor put, or failed to put, a space following a comma. Obviously, commas at ends of lines and those used as terminal punctuation are omitted from the count. Sometimes there is a space before as well as after, or a space before, not after. Taken as a whole, the text of The White Devil contains 899 commas which are spaced (327 of them up to E4 v , 572 thereafter) and 265 which are not spaced (165 up to E4 v , 100 thereafter). The general statistic, then, is that the compositors were 3.4 times more likely to put a space after a comma than not (1.98 times up to E4 v ; 5.72 times afterwards). In B's 22 pages there are only 8 unspaced commas, compared to 257 spaced: he was 32.1 times more likely to space a comma than not, and he averaged 12 commas a page. In the 25 pages more or less firmly assigned to A, there are 256 spaced, and 85 unspaced commas; he was 3.0 times more likely to space a comma than not. This is a significantly lower proportion of unspaced commas than in the B-E4 v section of the play. The possibility that Compositor B could have worked in gatherings B-E is eliminated by the second class of spacing evidence, tabulated in column two of Table 2. In this I list the number of punctuation marks (the ! ? : and ;) which have a space before and after them, compared with those that only have a space after. Up to E4 v , a mere 24 marks have spaces before and after; 107 have the space after, a proportion of 1:4.46. In Compositor B's pages from F3 r on, the numbers are 267 spaced before and after, against 39 spaced after, a proportion of 6.8:1; in the pages assigned to Compositor A the numbers are 31 before and after, against 275 spaced after, 12 a proportion of 1:8.87, or rather more than the opposite of Compositor B. The discrepancy between the proportion for B-E4 v and A's stint after F1 r is statistically significant, though obviously not of the same order of difference as that between A and B. In conclusion, and with due regard for Professor McKenzie's caveat, it seems clear to me that Compositor B almost invariably set a space before as well as after the four marks under discussion, and that by a substantial proportion he preferred to put a space after a comma; Compositor A very seldom put a space before any of the four marks, and was much more variable not only in his treatment of commas, but in the number of them he used on a page. Curiously, it seemed not to make a great deal of difference to these practices whether the compositor was setting "verse" or "prose", though in certain individual lines of course it is possible to detect use or absence of spaces as aids to justification. But it hardly affects the overall pattern, so in Table 2 I have been content to indicate if there is prose on the page in question rather than go into elaborate detail about it. 4. Compositor-analysis by spellings . Compositor-analysis has traditionally been done by searching a number of words for evidence of habitual spellings. The net of potential words has grown larger over the years, but at the same time the method has grown more sophisticated. It has been recognized that the most telling kinds of habitual spelling are often not whole words but the treatment of suffixes and verbal endings such as -d, -ed, -'d or -t to form the preterite. Even so, it must be admitted that less new evidence was yielded by this investigation than by those previously described. I searched the following in Q1 of The White Devil , in this instance using the Malone copy for reference, and the results are tabulated below: Group 1. Endings -ie/ -y; -'d/ (unvoiced) -ed /-d /-t; -our / -or; -'s / -s in possessives; -l / -ll (and also, separately, the words all / al); -es / -ess / -esse. Group 2. The common doublet spellings: do /doe; go / goe; here / heere / [other forms of the word]; Ile or ile / I'll or I'le; were / weare; heart / hart; been / bin / byn / bene; blood / bloud; nere and ere / ne're and e're; mischeefe / mischiefe; whore / whoore; cossin / cousin; lie / lye; truely / truly; pitty / pity; poyson / poison; ith / i'th; tis / 'tis. Group 3. Single or double terminal e: be/bee; me/mee; he/hee; she/shee; we/wee. Group 4. Words which begin in -in or -en. Group 5. In addition I searched and recorded the spelling of 294 other words whose spelling appeared to be idiosyncratic. Of the endings in Group 1, the most useful was the first. There is throughout the play a general tendency to form the preterite in 'd in verse, but the other terminations turn up irregularly and in insufficient numbers to help. Endings in -or are rather less frequent than endings in -our (1:1.3 up to the end of gathering E, 1:2.3 thereafter); both forms may be found however on the same page, and in view of the relatively small size of the sample (about 65 items) and the effect on the figures of the influence of "prose" setting, it does not prove possible to make much use of these endings as discriminators. The contrast between four -our forms on I1 r and four -or forms on I4 v may suggest a tendency on B's part to prefer -our, and A to prefer -or, but I would not put it more strongly than that. Possessives are formed with or without an apostrophe indiscriminately (though E3 v is unusual, with no fewer than seven possessives without the apostrophe; by contrast, I4 v uses apostrophes six times —most pages have far fewer possessives). Terminal -ll is greatly preferred to -l, and most of the times the latter does occur, it is in prose or a tightly-justified line; the form "al" does not occur. The -esse termination is preferred; -ess does not occur, and -es is rare. Philip Williams, in his article, lit upon the two spellings from Group 2 that prove to be most helpful to compositor-determination in this play. The use or omission of the apostrophe in 'Ile' / 'I'le' is the most valuable discriminator, and the use or omission of the apostrophe in 'ne're' etc. follows sufficiently closely on its use or omission in 'I'le', for it to be tabulated in the same column (see below, Table 2). Rather unusually, both forms occur on pages C2 r , D3 r , E4 v , I4 v and K3 v ; elsewhere the pages conform to one or the other form. The compositors' practices in spelling 'do' or 'doe' are helpful, and are also tabulated below. There are only two occurrences of 'goe', both on I4 r ; 'heere' occurs relatively seldom also: on D1 r , G3 r (p), I1 v (but so does 'here'), K1 v (p), K3 r (p), L1 r , twice on L1 v (p), and L2 v ; 'heare' is found on C1 v and L1 r , 'heer' on I4 v and 'heer's' on K2 r . Elsewhere the spelling is 'here'. Few of the other listed variants occur frequently enough to be of any serious help. 'Weare' (=were), for instance, occurs occasionally (five times on B3 r ) up to D3 v , but not thereafter. 'Heart' is the usual form, but 'hart' shares a page with it on B4 v and H1 v . The various unusual ways of spelling 'been' may reflect oddity in the copy more than anything else, with the exception of 'bin', which compositor B seems to have quite favoured: apart from two occurrences in prose on B2 v , it is found on H1 v , I1 r , I1 v , K2 r and M1 v (twice); it also occurs in Compositor A's page K4 v , but there it is a rhyme-word. 'Bloud' is the usual form; 'blood' is found on E3 r , L2 r , and no fewer than four times on M1 v ! These words, together with those of Group 5, occur so seldom that while they may help to confirm the assignation of a page to a compositor, of themselves they cannot determine one. Group 3 proved both helpful and frustrating, and the actual count of words spelled each way is listed in Table 2. It is clear that these discriminators can be misleading. For instance, while I have listed page F4 r as revealing "B" preferences (on the grounds that there are four -ee endings against only one -e ending), at the same time I have shown page I3 r as indicative of A's habits: even though it has five -ee endings, it also has eight -e endings. Clearly, Compositor A could set a few -ee endings per page if he felt like it. The range is from the extraordinarily definite page I4 r , with 22 -ee, and no -e endings, to page G1 v , with none of either! In his edition (p. lxiii), John Russell Brown gives the impression that Group 4 is a significant discriminator, that A preferred -en and B preferred -in. However, I found very few -en forms, and very, very few words spelled both ways: there is 'entreat' on C3 r and 'intreat' on C2 v and G3 r , 'endanger' on C4 r and 'indanger' on D4 r ; 'enough' is the usual form, but 'inough' occurs on C3 r (which rather counters the effect of the 'entreat' on the same page). It seems that this can scarcely be used as a test. Of the Group 5 spellings, 136 had to be dismissed, as being invariant (for instance 'answere' is the only form of the word used in the play), or variable only where the results are uninformative ('claime' for instance is spelled thus in the play except on L1 r , where 'clame' occurs—but in a prose passage), or where the word occurs only twice or thrice in the play. 13 There are for instance some particularly odd spellings in the italic description of the dumbshows on D4 v —E1 r , whch occur nowhere else. A few words, entertainingly, are spelled in different ways on the same page: 'bawdes' / 'baudes' on G1 v ; 'carracter' / 'character' on E3 v ; 'Citty' / 'Cittie' on H3 r ; 'dreampt' / 'drempt' on K3 v , 'Physitions' / 'Physitians' on I4 v . Such events are neither unusual nor surprising in dramatic texts of the period. Very few words recurred sufficiently in clearly different forms to be revealed as characteristic of either Compositor A or B: 11, to be precise, which I now list: Compositor A Compositor B already # allready battels battailes commander(ers) commaund coine # coyne conuei'd conuayd dogs dogges * dost do'st ** fy fie *** gaule gall money # monie or mony (both on K2 r ) oath, oathes othe(s) yeare # yere **** These are slim pickings, which scarcely help at all in identifying uncertain pages. A number of words require some comment. In alphabetical order, they are: 'cousin' (n.) and 'cossin' both appear; the verb is usually spelled 'cosen', but 'cosin'd' and 'coosning' both appear. 'devil' is usually spelled 'deuill' (mainly by B, but by A as well); the plural is 'deuils'. Apart from one 'deuils' on E4 r , the forms found prior to gathering F are 'Deuell', on E3 r and E3 v and 'diuell' on C1 r , D4 r (and K1 v (B)). 'Deuelish' occurs on K2 v (B), but neither 'devil' nor 'divel' are found (except the latter, on the title-page!). 'die' is slightly preferred by B and 'dye' slightly preferred by A, but they use both forms. One of the oddest spellings in the play is 'Eu' on C1 r and 'Eugh' on H4 r for 'yew'. One can guess that the compositors were influenced by their copy. 'nostrils' appears as 'nostrels' on C3 v , 'nosthrils' on G1 v (A) and G3 v (B); 'nosthrills' on G4 v (and 'nosthrill' on E3 v ). The exclamation 'o' with a circumflex (which occurs 18 times in the play) looks at first like a possible authorial form, since it is found throughout the play, and in both A's and B's pages. Confirmation seems at hand when it turns up in A Monumental Column , C1 r , line 6. That is, until one notices that the printer of this work was also Nicholas Okes. It may, therefore, be a "house" practice, if a rather intermittent one. Both compositors use the form 'to th', but 'to'th' (a common form in The Devils Law-Case ) occurs twice, in A pages. 'True' is the usual spelling, but 'trew' is found on B1 v , B2 v , B4 v , E3 v (twice), E4 r and I4 r (B). This is a rare case of a spelling preferred by B being found early in the play. There are ample instances of compositorial inconsistency (that is, using more than one spelling for a word). For instance, both A and B spell 'breast' and 'brest', 'hower' and 'howre' (but never 'hour' or 'houre'); B spells 'flowers' and also 'flowres'; A spells both 'forty' and 'fourty'. 'Murder' and its derivatives are spelled with a d, except on I4 v , where A allows himself a 'murther'; 'neere' and 'ore' are spelled thus by both compositors, but B also uses 'neare', and A usually prefers 'o're'. 'Polliticke' is the usual form in the play; B also uses 'politicke' (G4 r ) and 'pollitique' (G3 v , in prose); A supplies one 'pollitick', but the line is tight (I4 v ). Generally, it must be concluded that wordspellings support, but do not materially aid, the distinction between Compositors A and B. Two important hopes for definitive results from investigations of composition practices were frustrated. The first, and shorter, is the odd case of gathering M, which contains some very confusing contradictions in the evidence, as may be seen from Table 2. Specifically, while M1 r —2 r show clearly Compositor B's preferences for spacing, both of commas and other punctuation marks (columns 1 and 2), and for the spellings 'Ile' and 'doe', these pages show equally clearly Compositor A's preference for -y endings, while the evidence of -e/-ee terminations is ambiguous. In addition, gathering M contains some unique spellings: for instance 'ayre' which elsewhere in the play is 'aire'; 'behould' ('behold'); 'betraid' ('betray'); 'could' ('cold'); 'cought' ('caught') 'noe' (twice, as against 'no'—73 occurrences); 'Sirha' ('sirra' / 'sirrah'); and both 'woeman' and 'woemen' (twice), against 'woman' 22 times elsewhere, and the four occurrences of 'blood' on M1 v already noted. These idiosyncratic spellings occur on M1 r , M1 v and M2 r but not on M2 v . In light of the conflicting evidence elsewhere in the gathering it is tempting indeed to think that another compositor might have taken over the final half gathering and preliminaries. The alternative, that both A and B worked on gathering M in a quite indiscriminate way, is difficult both to demonstrate and to imagine working in practice, especially in view of these unusual spellings. But I hardly think that they prove beyond question the presence of a Compositor C either. The second question deals with the composition of gatherings B—E. The issues to be decided now are, first, whether any of the spelling evidence confirms or refutes the hypothesis already established that neither compositor A or B worked in these gatherings; and secondly whether there is anything to suggest that there was more than one compositor working in gatherings B—E. Evidence for the former is equivocal and scanty. Few of A's commonest word-spellings appear, and though the discriminators listed in Table 2 show a good deal of similarity between most of the pages in gatherings B—E and Compositor A's later in the book, there are anomalies and incomplete parallels in this evidence. The occasional signs of B's preferences surface so irregularly and randomly that we can safely rule out his participation. 14 One line of investigation is to note spellings in B—E against which both A and B agree. There are some: 'eather' on B1 v , against 'either'; 'fayre' against 'faire'; 'fier' on B3 v and E3 v , elsewhere 'fire'; 'only' on B1 v , D3 v , E3 v (and 'onlie' on B3 r ) against 'onely' elsewhere; 'ritch' on E3 v , 'rich' elsewhere; 'voyage' on B2 v , B4 r (prose) and E1 r , against 'voiage' on L3 v . It is not a rich harvest; the spellings of the earlier gatherings tend to have more unusual forms than those of the later, but this could be as readily accounted for by the compositor's increasing assurance with the MS. hand, and consequent decreasing tendency to reproduce copy-spellings, as by a change of workman. In short, the study of spellings does not materially influence the conclusion reached above, that A and B did not work on the book prior to gathering F. It is true that this requires us to posit, in Compositors N and A, workmen whose practices were in many respects closely similar, and only susceptible of discrimination on the basis of statistical analysis rather than by gross variation in spelling preferences. However, this scenario is by no means an unlikely one in a shop like Nicholas Okes's, where much employment was made, as Blayney has shown, of casual journeymen. Also to be reckoned with is the likelihood that an apprentice will learn habits from his master that he will retain as a journeyman. In short, the differences between A and N are subtle but sufficiently clear, when all the evidence is weighed, to assert with some confidence that they were two separate workmen. The speech-prefixes help to confirm this determination. The most suggestive is that for Francisco, the Duke of Florence, whose prefix in B—E is usually 'Fran.' (46 times), but occasionally 'Fra.' (9 times). Compositor A prefers 'Fra.' (38 times, to 8 'Fran.'), while Compositor B's preferences are opposite: he uses 'Fran.' 23 times, to 5 of 'Fra.' This alone would go a long way towards confirming that A and N are different workmen. 15 Flamineo's prefix is 'Fla.', except in gatherings C—E, where it is 'Flam.'; in the same way, Brachiano is usually 'Bra.', except in C—E, where he is (mostly) 'Brac.', though eleven 'Bra.' forms occur. In other words, it seems as if Compositor N agreed with both A and B in preferring 'Bra.' and 'Flam.' in gathering B only . Why he should have used 'Brac.' twelve times, and then preferred 'Bra.' in the proportion 55:12 is hard to guess, but it is worth noticing that 'Brac.' occurs only twice after gathering F begins. As for 'Fla.', it is possible that in casting off for gathering C, Compositor N might have realized that 'Fla.' for Flamineo and 'Fra.' was a potent source of error (Francisco does not appear in gathering B), and decided to distinguish the characters by prefixing Flamineo 'Flam.' If so, he was right: a mistaken prefix for Francisco occurs at least six times, and perhaps once for Flamineo. But why he should have altered the established prefix 'Fla.' instead of adding the letter to Francisco's prefix, I cannot venture to guess. No other prefix occurs regularly enough in variant form to be evidential: Vittoria is 'Vit.' except for three 'Vitto.' prefixes on B4 r ; Camillo is 'Cam.' until his untimely death except for six 'Camil.' prefixes, which share B4 r with four 'Cam.'s. To resume, the most significant speech-prefix is Francisco's, which confirms the distinction between A and N. When we come to try to use occasional spellings in an attempt to determine if there was more than one workman in the B—E section, the evidence is even less promising, as the following list of variant spellings shows. (These variant spellings apply only to the first four gatherings; many of the words, let alone variant spellings of them, do not occur in later gatherings.) It would perhaps be just possible to suggest, on the basis of this listing, that one compositor (N) set B1 r-v , B3 v —C1 r , D3 v , E1 r —E3 v , while another (O) set B2 v —3 r , C1 v —D3 r , D4 r , E4 r-v . There is no evidence for B2 r , D1 v , D4 v . However, this "evidence" is so sparse that it cannot be regarded as more than suggestive (though the cluster of unusual spellings on E3 v is worthy of remark). Besides, the principal discriminators listed in Table 2 fail to support any such assignment. Throughout the B—E section of the book the preferred spellings are 'do', 'go' and 'here', and words which could end in -e or -ee, or -ie or -y, tend to be found in the forms subsequently favoured by Compositor A, or at least in forms which do not give any support to the hypothesis that more than one workman was employed in the first four gatherings of The White Devil . If we return to the matter of ending sentences without punctuation, or with a mark other than a period, we do find a suggestion of evidence that is not inconsistent with the hypothetical distinction between "N" and "O". In the pages suggested for compositor N, there are 10 speeches ending without any punctuation, and 35 with irregular pointing (28 with comma, 7 other marks); in those suggested for O, the figures are 16 without punctuation, and 13 with irregular (9 with commas, 4 other marks). (4 irregular sentences occur in unassigned pages.) That is, the "N" pages show some preference for irregular punctuation rather than none at all, a preference that is reversed in the "O" pages. However, in my opinion, it is best to dismiss all this speculation as the chasing of moonbeams, for the evidence is really no more substantial. The only responsible conclusion at this juncture is that we have no entirely compelling reason to see the hand of more than one workman before gathering F, a workman now adequately discriminated from the compositors who began to set in gathering F. The possibility that yet another workman may have been briefly involved during gathering E is discussed in Part III. As to the question of whether the compositor of B—E could also have set M and A, the answer cannot be firm either, but the likelihood is that he did not. There are spellings (already noted) which occur only in M, and few spellings or practices which resemble those of B—E. I conclude this section by tabulating the various discriminators discussed above. The table reveals that the usual opinion (that compositors normally were responsible for setting an entire page) must be qualified for The White Devil . Note especially the peculiarities in F2 v , H4 v , I4 v and L2 v , all of which show some signs of shared setting, signs amounting to strong evidence in F2 v and L2 v at least. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the use of the letters "A" and "B" in all columns save the last does NOT mean that I am attributing the page to either compositor: on the contrary, as should by now be clear, I believe that gatherings B—E were set by another workman, Compositor N. The purpose of the letters is to show whether the discriminator in question corresponds with the practice of either A or B as described in detail above. The final column lists the compositor I believe set the page in question, on the basis of a comparison of all the discriminators. The very inadequacy of the evidence for either A or B in gatherings B—E is the chief reason why I believe them to have been set by a different workman altogether. TABLE 2 Compositor Determinants Column 1 lists whether or not a comma is followed by a space; the figure to the left of the virgula indicates the number of commas that are spaced; that to the right indicates how many are unspaced. Column 2 indicates the kind of spacing associated with punctuation marks other than commas or periods: the number to the left of the virgula indicates punctuation marks which have spaces before and after them; the number to the right of the virgula indicates those that have spaces after them only. Column 3 indicates if the two kinds of spacing evidence together is characteristic of either Compositor A or Compositor B; a ? following the letter indicates a limited agreement; when a blank is left, this means that the discriminators are ambiguous. Column 4 tabulates optional -ie or -y endings (for example, 'away' is not tabulated because the form 'awaie' does not occur). In this column an entry such as 0/4|2/4 means that there are no -ie forms in verse, but four in prose on the page, while there are two -y forms in verse and four in prose. Column 5 attempts to indicate if the pages reveal either A's or B's habits, on the basis of Column 4's evidence, in the same manner as Column 3. Column 6 simply indicates whether the page as a whole shows signs of Compositor B's preference for 'Ile' and 'nere' or of Compositor A's preference for 'I'le' and 'ne're'. Column 7 tabulates 'do' and 'doe' in the same way. (In fact, 'doe' is not found before F2 v .) Column 8 indicates the number of -ee and of -e endings found, and indicates which compositor's preference the page corresponds to. Column 9 represents a total assessment of the evidence, by assignation of pages to compositors N, A, and B, on the basis of evidence in this table, and elsewhere in this article. In columns 6-9, the presence of a letter indicates strong preference; and a ? indicates equivocal evidence; in all columns an = sign means that the discriminators are equal; a — means the discriminator does not appear on the page in question.

      <field name="fulltext">Part Three: Type-Study I should have liked to report that I had established the order of printing of the formes of The White Devil , but in some embarrassment I must confess that despite diligent attempts, the Povey lamp failed to yield me much illumination on this question. 16 Nor, unfortunately, was an examination of the watermarks very much more revealing. In fact I have not been able to examine the watermarks of every copy of Q1 of The White Devil ; apart from the fact that some libraries take an understandably dim view of the kind of treatment the binding gets in such investigations, and that few institutions are equipped with mechanical devices to make such examinations less damaging to the book, I have not been able to visit every library holding a copy of the Quarto. Of the large number that I have seen, I examined the paper of the three copies in the British Library, and that in the Bute Collection of the National Library of Scotland. These were sufficient to make it immediately evident that Okes did not buy a special heap of paper to print Webster's play. In these four copies, a great variety of pot paper appears, with at least 20 and probably more different watermarks. In addition, numerous gatherings are printed on paper which seems entirely devoid of watermark: half-gatherings A and M in all three BL copies, for instance (Bute has a watermark in M), but elsewhere in the book: BL copy 840 c.37, for instance, has no watermarks in A, C, I, K, M; Bute lacks them in A—D, but has them elsewhere. In view of the evidently random nature of the papers being used, I have not pursued this line of enquiry. Another route to the determination of printing order lies in examination of the skeleton-formes. Although John Russell Brown complained, "The running titles in this quarto are so similar to each other that it is very difficult to trace the press-work in detail," ("Printing II," 117) and although it is true, as was noted above, that for some reason the headline impressed very heavily, thus obscuring the kinds of typographical damage on which identification is based, with care all the settings of the headline can be identified. Altogether, there are ten settings of the running-title, "Vittoria Corombona". Seven settings are used in gathering B (B1 r of course has no running title); that is, two skeleton formes were made up. However, the skeleton employed for inner B was used to print both inner and outer formes of gathering C; the headlines were re-arranged for inner C and the skeleton rotated for the outer forme. Rotated again, this skeleton was used for the inner forme of D, and then for the outer forme of gatherings E—L, in the course of which it was rotated and re-arranged twice more. The headlines used in outer B, with one new one for the fourth page, are used in outer D, and then become the regular skeleton for the inner formes from E to K. When inner K was stripped two of the headlines apparently were distributed, since two new ones were set for inner L. One of these does not recur, but that on L3 v is used again in half-gathering M, together with one headline from the inner skeleton and two from the outer. What this means, in summary, is that most of the book was regularly printed with two skeletons, though an apparent error was made in the early distribution of part of the inner forme skeletons after gathering K was machined. Rather more interestingly, since all of gatherings B and C was in type at the same time (as evidence described below will confirm), Compositor N must have imposed his pages for inner and outer C in separate chases, and transferred the skeleton from the inner forme, once machining was complete, to the chase containing the pages of the outer forme. Yet the skeleton of outer B was not broken up, since its headlines survive to reappear in outer D, and inner E—L. There is thus little in the skeleton-evidence to aid in determining order of printing. These lines of enquiry not having proved particularly fruitful, let us turn to the crucial matter of the analysis of damaged types. The three principal purposes of such an investigation are as follows: first, that such types can be used to determine beyond question whether the book was set by formes. That is, if the same identical type turns up in both inner and outer forme of the same gathering, the inescapable inference is that it must have been distributed back into the case after the forme was worked, and re-set into the next forme. A quarto set seriatim would need to have seven of the eight pages of a gathering in type before the inner forme could be machined. The likelihood, in such a case, that the inner forme could be distributed and its types used in setting the eighth page of the gathering is vanishingly small, unless by some chance there was some kind of a hiatus in printing. Q1 of The White Devil reveals no reliable instance of a type occurring in both inner and outer formes of the same gathering. In view of the number of damaged types recorded, the chance that none of them would have so recurred is distinctly slight, if setting by formes had indeed been used. I did in fact record two highly questionable possible cases: i number 1 on L3 v and L4 v , and half-cap T 3 on L1 r and L3 v . 17 In each instance the identification is classed only as "possible", and doubtless the letters are different, and look similar by mere coincidence. Certainly neither identification is reliable enough for any suggestion that setting by formes was employed to be based upon them. In any event, the pattern of composition already established by other evidence rules out the idea that the book was set by formes. Indeed, it would have been surprising, in view of the battered state of the fount, if no such instances of doubtful identification had turned up. Secondly, some indications of the order of printing can be derived from the re-appearance of damaged types in new setting. The thing to be established is the pages at which previously-used types re-appear, which will indicate when the forme in which the type first occurred was ready for distribution. The assumption has sometimes been made that an entire forme was distributed at a time. The evidence suggests that this was not done in The White Devil ; consequently, the unit adopted here is the page, and even that can be of doubtful validity. In practice, the page to be distributed must be taken from the stone or chase a few lines at a time, and there is no physical reason why the distribution could not be shared by different compositors. The irreducible minimum unit of distribution, in practical fact (as any printer will acknowledge), is the single line, nothing more. However, it is likely enough that, with certain exceptions to be mentioned later, each compositor in the main distributed an entire page. Thirdly, the career of the types through the book can be traced, and from this study it is possible to determine with some accuracy the order of distribution and setting of the pages. It is also possible to indentify the actual cases used. The assumption that each compositor worked from his "own" case is not one that it is safe to make for a shop like Okes's, but where type-evidence supports spelling and punctuation-evidence, it can be valuable additional evidence in the matter of compositor-identification. However, before any of these purposes can be achieved, the types must be identified. The first major work to attempt type-analysis was Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (2 vols., 1963), and Hinman's methods have been followed by most subsequent investigators. However, as Peter Blayney ( op. cit. , p. 91) very rightly observed, the quantity of types that proved sufficient for Hinman's purposes, working on a Folio forme, is quite inadequate for the much smaller dimensions of a quarto. For instance, in King Lear , Hinman's methods enabled him to identify an average of 23 types per forme, but in a quarto set seriatim, a comparable density to Hinman's would result in only about 5 types per page. Blayney's attempt to gather a quantity of evidence of a different order of magnitude can fairly be described as heroic. "Bodleian Library copy 1 of Lear was examined type by type under magnification. Every type which differed at all noticeably from the normal appearance of that character was noted by ringing the corresponding type on a photocopy of a facsimile. Over 7000 types were thus marked." He then repeated the procedure with the Capell copy, compared the results, eliminated inking flaws etc. and ended up with 6000. In the next phase, "many of the types originally marked were rejected . . . either because they were insufficiently distinctive or because there were far too many examples of nearly-identical appearance"; his final haul was "a list of over 2000 appearances made by 571 types", which gave him an average density of about 25 per page ( op. cit. , pp. 93-94). If his procedure had been as reliable as it sounds this would be excellent, but in practice the results he achieved do not bear out his claims. 18 I suspect the density of evidence Blayney sought is simply not available. My working method was different: I kept the three British Library copies of Q1 before me as I worked, in order to avoid (so far as was possible) the process of assembling and then rejecting evidence that Blayney went through. I drew a detailed illustration of each letter that appeared irregular in all three copies, assigned it a number, and referred all subsequent and similarly damaged letters to the illustration, making direct comparison back and forth between the three copies as I went along. This procedure was not alone sufficient to secure an adequate standard of accuracy; in addition to the three British Library copies, I was obliged to seek confirmation also from the three copies in the Dyce collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and from libraries as far apart as the Bodleian, the Folger, and the Huntington. My list of queries includes types that were confirmed only after the consultation of the tenth copy, and some that resolutely refused to yield certainty. It takes an enormous amount of time, but yields more accurate results than Blayney's (which was partly imposed on him by the fact that no library owns more than two copies of the Pide Bull Lear ). What it also does is demonstrate that the kind of density of evidence Blayney hoped to achieve is probably not possible. One must of course make all due allowance for the difference between the type used in Lear and that employed for The White Devil : the fount for the Webster play was larger, and the impression made by the type is less crisp (and therefore subject to far more ambiguity) than that of Lear . Even with these allowances made, the result was at first sight disappointingly inferior to Blayney's: I ended up altogether with 734 appearances of 265 types, or 8.7 per page—but a number of these are of doubtful reliability. This has an important bearing on Blayney's observation (p. 91), "Unless the evidence-density is great enough to reveal at least two prior distributions in every quarto page, the order in which those pages were set cannot be proved beyond doubt". I believe he is right, but I do not believe that all it takes to provide such density of evidence is, like Boxer, to work harder. On the contrary, the more exacting the investigation, the more careful one becomes with unreliable evidence. There are three different classes of damaged letter, which need to be carefully discriminated. First, there are those letters so individually and characteristically damaged that they are evident and unmistakable to the naked eye, and can even be made out on a xerox. Unfortunately, such types are likely to be noticed by the compositor or proof-reader, and discarded rather than distributed. In the present survey, for instance, of the 81 letters of this class which I found to recur, 41 recur once only. Secondly, there are types which have characteristic smaller flaws which can however be positively identified under magnification, if careful comparison of a number of original impressions is made. This is eye-breaking work, if it is to be done reliably; however, it ultimately yields firm results if persisted with. The third class is where frustration sets in on a major scale. Types appear which are at first glance characteristically damaged, but which turn out to share the damage in a way that makes them useless: three lower case h on three successive pages, for instance, all so identically damaged that one cannot be distinguished from another. Letters which have a vertical joining a curve are most prone to damage at the join: b, d, h, n, m, p, q, r, u. Letters with a closed section will accumulate a plug of ink in the eye: a, b, d, e, g, o, p, q; this plug is sometimes permanent, and sometimes removed by washing: one can find a letter which looks identical in half a dozen copies, only to find in the seventh that the ink-plug has been cleaned. Letters with ascenders and descenders will sooner or later get bent: b, d, h, l, k, p, q, y. Anything with a kern will eventually be bent or broken: f, long s, and their associated ligatures, and j. Lower-case o is unusually prone to damage, with cracks at any point in its circumference; and unidentifiable damaged lower-case e are so frustratingly common that sometimes one feels one would do better counting the undamaged ones. Faults in impression must be firmly distinguished from damage to the type, which is sometimes difficult: if one copy shows a damaged letter where the others do not, is it a bad impression, or was the type damaged, and the copy with the flawed letter the last to be printed? Only if the type recurs can one be sure. Another common problem is the letter which, while undoubtedly damaged, prints differently in each copy. It is time to cry "hold, enough": every investigator who works on damaged type will come to the realization that a lot of the "evidence" is worthless if really closely examined: I routinely eliminated from the investigation such false fire as the ligatures long s-t, long s-h and ct in which the ligature is cracked at the top; lower case g in which the lower bowl is not closed; e and s with the ends of the letters worn; tilted or plugged e; plugged a; and a goodly number of other unusable letters. Even after all this elimination, I am left with a substantial number of identifications that must be classed as only "possible", which are listed with a question-mark in the Appendix of Damaged Types at the end of this article. These are letters that I think are the same, but which I will not rely on if other evidence seems to contradict them. Upper-case letters and numbers, italic sorts, punctuation and other typographical signs often offer clearer and more reliable kinds of damage than lower-case letters. But they recur so infrequently that they are seldom useful for the kind of analysis that must be undertaken. And they too can be susceptible to misidentification: for instance, capital I often develops a crushed serif when in conjunction with an apostrophe: compare the two 'I'le's on D1 v , lines 1 and 2, which are virtually impossible to distinguish. With these caveats and reservations in mind, let us proceed to analyse what the evidence of damaged types can tell us, firstly about the order in which the pages of the book were distributed. The results of this enquiry are found in Table 3 below, but some general observations are in order before seeing what the table reveals. First, it is apparent that the fount used to print the play was large enough to enable two entire gatherings (four formes) to be in type at the same time. This is proved by the fact that no distribution of gathering B was necessary in order to set gathering C. 19 I have not gone to the heroic extent of counting each type in these two gatherings, but at a rough estimate a full page of 37 lines in prose would contain almost 2300 characters (including spaces); the first two gatherings are about 75% verse overall, which would work out to around 27,500 pieces of type, or a good deal more than a "quarter bill". 20 There are no special signs of type-shortage in the setting of gatherings B and C, or indeed, throughout the book. The use of italic or roman punctuation (or black-letter and roman periods) seems essentially motiveless (that is, the compositor(s) could not be bothered sorting them out, rather than that they are signs of type-shortages as such). There are, indeed, not a few wrong-fount punctuation marks apart from the black-letter periods (note for instance the comma in line 20, and the second comma in line 29, of B4 r : the first clearly belongs to a fount of smaller size than pica, the second to a larger). The use of italic capital Y instead of roman is occasional throughout the play, but this seems to be the only sort in the fount in generally short supply; occasionally VV is set for W, in E2 r , H1 r (thrice), K3 v (5 times) and K4 r (twice); half-cap vv is set for half-cap w quite often in gathering E: E1 r , E2 r (thrice), E2 v and E3 r : the problem here is the speech-prefix 'Lavv.' for 'Lawyer'. Some of the long s-h ligatures may come from another fount: note the instances in lines 1 and 12 of B4 v , for example, which do not range with the other letters. Either a half-capital o or a zero (in the absence of numerals in the play it is impossible to be certain) is intermittently used instead of lower-case o; the first one is on B2 v line 17, the second o in "consumption"; there are 32 altogether in the play, occurring in pages set from both cases. Elsewhere, a lower-case o may substitute for the half-capital: see the speech-prefix 'Lodo.', B1 v line 10, for instance. However, these isolated instances of petty carelessness hardly amount to evidence of general type-shortage; on the contrary, the absence of any more evidence than this implies that the fount must have been pretty large. One's initial reaction is, that since a single pair of cases could never have held enough type to set four formes, two cases must have been used, and two compositors therefore at work. (As an experiment, I counted the number of lower-case o in my case of 12-point Bembo. The box was about half full, and held 280 letters. Okes's sort-box—assuming it was about the same size—would probably have held between 500 and 600 letters before they started to slide over the rim into the box below. But there are 1508 lower-case o in gatherings B and C of The White Devil .) Of course the assumption is false: if most of the type was locked up in formes, the quantity in the case never need be more than the compositor immediately required. That is, the compositor would distribute into his case, as required, from the chase that held the type in its previous employment, and set B and C from that source. Obviously, by the time all four formes were in type, he must have been scraping the bottom of the barrel, an inference which is supported by the great cascade of types from B3 v (which as the table shows was the first page to be distributed) which show up in D1 r . But the method of working was entirely viable. A second thing which the table makes evident is that as work proceeded, the types from many pages tend to reappear in clusters. Of the 84 pages in gatherings B-M, 23 pages yield types that reappear in some numbers on certain pages (those listed in column 4 in the table). Another 12 pages resurface in minor clusters; 31 pages do not cluster, and 18 pages seem not to have been distributed. The clustering effect is most obvious in the middle of the book, especially in gatherings E, F, G, H and I. Gatherings D and L have a number of pages with minor clusters. The inference is that a cluster occurs when a distribution has just taken place into a depleted case. One note of caution needs to be sounded. It is often assumed 21 that the types last distributed will normally be the first to be re-set. But this is contrary to the experience of those who set type themselves, and are trying to recover a misdistributed sort from a box. Because the cases are at an angle, and because type-metal is heavy, gravity ensures that mixing takes place. The likelihood of a cluster occurring, then, is increased if the case is getting low. Type appears to have been at its shortest in the first pages of E (in which types cluster on E1 r , E1 v , E3 r and E3 v ) when C was distributed. The shortages at the beginning of G, the middle of H, and the beginning of I are accounted for by simultaneous working of two compositors: the activity of the workmen ran the cases nearly dry in I. Subsequently, in K and L some mixing of the cases may have taken place (as is described below), possibly to ease shortages of sorts in one case. Let us now turn to the table, and analyse the information to be obtained from it. It should be stressed that inferences concerning which case a page was distributed into can only be drawn from observing in which pages damaged types from the distributed page recur. Thus E1 r was undoubtedly distributed into case x, since a large number of its types recur in G1 v , set by Compositor A. Only one case was in use during the setting of gatherings B-D; this might be also called case x. But to do so would be misleading, since while much of case y was created by distribution, as described below, this practice would not ensure an adequate supply of all sorts. Types must have been imported from the original case to supply deficiencies during case y's establishment. I therefore believe it to be a more accurate reflection of the facts of the situation to regard the case in use for gatherings B-D as the ancestor of both cases x and y, whose identities do not become distinct until gathering C was distributed. And even then it is too early to say whether the distributor was Compositor N, or one or both of Compositors A, or B, or some other journeyman entirely. Not until compositors A and B begin regular work is it possible to assign the distribution of any page reliably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TABLE 3 Type-Distribution The first column is the distributed page; column two is the first page on which a type from that page definitely recurs; the third column lists any recurrence of a "possible" type earlier than that in column two; column four lists the page(s) in which a major influx of types from the distributed page is found; column five the pages with a minor concentration (i.e. at least two types). Column six lists the pages whose distribution can be assigned to either Compositor A or B; and column seven the case into which the page was distributed, where this can be determined. A summary of the distribution of the book revealed by this table shows that the inner forme of B, beginning with B3 v was the first to be distributed; the remainder of the inner forme followed promptly. B2 v was probably the first page of the outer forme to be distributed (since a type turns up, doubtless as a proof-correction, in C2 r ), and was followed by the other pages of outer B. It seems likely enough, then, that inner B was machined first, followed by the outer forme; both formes of C seem to have been distributed at roughly the same time. This could mean (though it need not) that another workman was aiding in distribution. The first types from inner and outer D likewise show up simultaneously, at E4 v . Then inner E is the first to appear, at F2 v ; outer E does not surface until G1 v , but this gap is undoubtedly accounted for by the distribution now going into separate cases. It does, however, seem that E2 r was distributed before the rest of the forme. F4 r is the first inner F page to appear, as early as G3 v ; the outer forme was not ready for distribution until H3 r ; since both were distributed by Compositor B, it seems clear that a genuine delay was involved. By contrast, both formes of G were ready for distribution at the same time: types from both G1 v and G4 v appear on I1 r , which, together with the rapid reappearance of other pages of G, confirms that type was growing short in this gathering. At this point printing must have been moving ahead briskly; inner H was ready for distribution when I4 v was still being set; the outer forme first appears on K1 v , but thanks to the compositors' division of labour, the rest of the forme does not appear until a good deal later. I1 r appears on K3 v , in advance of any types from the inner forme, the first of which comes on K4 r from I2 r . Evidence begins to fade away at this point; there is a possible appearance of a type from K3 v on L2 r (if it is really the same type, it was probably a proofing-change), but the first reliable occurrence is inner forme K1 v on L4 v ; outer K does not appear until M1 v (K1 r ), and most of K does not turn up at all; nor does any reliable type from L. The conclusion is that the printing would appear to have been entirely regular, with the inner forme routinely being machined first. Outer I was perhaps ready for distribution before the inner forme, but they could also have both been available, and the compositor merely have chosen to unlock the outer forme first. In summary, there is no reason to think that The White Devil was printed in any way other than regularly, inner forme before outer, and that the pages were distributed as the compositor(s) came to them, in no particular order. It is now time to return to columns six and seven of the preceding table. Let us take it that the normal method of operation was that a compositor would ordinarily distribute a page of type into his case, and then set his next page from the same case. Assuming this, it is possible to list in column six the workman in question, from gathering F onwards, and also in column seven to specify the case into which each page was distributed. Some anomalies surface as a result in the form of pages whose types turn up in more than one compositor's stint. These pages are G2 r , G4 v , and I2 r . Readers will recall from Part Two of this article that page I2 v was classed as doubtful, assigned by Williams to Compositor B but in this article re-assigned to A, despite the presence in it of a number of B's preferred spellings. The types from G2 r which occur in it are found in lines 4, 5, 11 and 30—well-scattered, in other words, and therefore not leading one to suspect that the distribution of G2 r was shared, but rather that A distributed the entire page. The likely explanation is that the "possible" type from G2 r found on I1 r (a certain B page) is probably a false identification. In the same way, it is more likely that type m 2 from G4 v is the type found in line 10 of I1 r than that h 2 is the same type as in line 5 of H4 r , which would entail the shared distribution of G4 v . However, I2 r presents a trickier problem. Even without wondering about the unassigned pages from gathering M, there is a conflict between K4 v , an A page, and L1 r , a B page. In this instance the plea of misidentification will not answer, since the type on K4 v , long s 11, is quite reliably indentified, and the cluster of types from the same page on L1 r is unmistakable. It will be necessary to return to this case subsequently. However, it is fairly clear that after Compositors A and B had settled into their stints of work, on the whole the expected pattern prevails: that a compositor distributes a page into his case, and sets his next work out of it. With this evidence to hand, and a number of detailed analyses which I will refrain from reproducing here, it is possible to be pretty definite about the pattern of setting and distribution of type in the text of The White Devil . As has already been observed, gatherings B and C were set before any type was distributed from them. As we have also seen, there was no need for this to imply more than one case or more than one workman. It is difficult to be precise as to how his work progressed in gathering D, partly because by mere chance there happen to be very few identifiable types in outer B (19, including 8 doubtful, against 46, including 12 doubtful, in inner B). During the setting of gathering E, both formes of C were distributed at intervals; indeed there is a sudden increase in types from outer C at E3 r and E3 v . It has already been remarked in Part Two of this article that there is something slightly irregular about these pages: they share a number of idiosyncratic spellings against most of the rest of the play, and the figures for the compositor-discriminators in Table 1 show some signs of difference from those of the preceding gatherings. It is evident that at some point in the composition of the play a second case was brought into use, and the likeliest place for this to have happened is when C2 v was being distributed. This would account for the number of types from pages in gatherings B and C which are found in both compositors' work later in the play. The pages which seem to form the basis of case y are (besides C2 v ) D1 v , D2 r , D3 r , D3 v , and D4 r (though there are some minor anomalies). As to whether Compositor B distributed all these pages, or whether another journeyman created case y and even perhaps set a few pages of E from it, the evidence is just not sufficiently clear to tell. As was made clear in Part Two of this article, there is no evidence of Compositor B's setting anywhere in the book before the last four or five lines of F2 v . On the basis of the evidence already described, it is reasonable to assume that divided setting began with gathering F. In Compositor A's first stint we find types from C1 v , C3 v , C4 r , C4 v , D1 r , D2 v and D3 v . Compositor B's case, by contrast, contained types from C2 v , D2 r , D3 r and D3 v . The only page whose distribution was shared, then, was D3 v , and only one type from that page (M 1) appears in case x; the remaining types recur in case y. A's next stint begins with F4 v and contains types from E1 r (a large cluster on G1 v ), E1 v , E2 r and E4 v , as well as some types from earlier gatherings. When B resumes at G3 r , his next four pages contain types from D1 v , D2 r , D3 r and D4 r as well as more recent ones from E2 v , E3 v and E4 r . Apart from the fact that Compositor B took over the last few lines of F2 v , the division of labour has for these two gatherings been most regular, with A taking the first four pages and B the second. It will be appreciated from this description that (as was said above) the compositors were not each responsible for distributing a forme, but seem to have taken pages from the stone virtually at random. Gathering H is divided differently, into pairs of pages: A set both rectos and versos of H2 and H4, and B of H1 and H3. As the manuscript must have been cast off and divided anyway, this method of working is no more difficult than the other. B must have distributed F3 v before setting H1 r , and A likewise distributed F1 v and F2 r before beginning H2 r . B made another distribution, chiefly of F3 r (from which five types appear on H3 r ) but also of F4 r , and A in turn distributed F1 r , F2 v (which leave respectively four and two types on H4 r ) and F4 v before the gathering was finished. So far the work has been a pattern of orderliness and regularity, and so it continues for the first three pages of gathering I, set by B from case y, into which he distributed G1 v and G4 r . Then Compositor A took over in I2 v , which I re-assigned in Part 2 above from B to A. I2 v contains numerous types from a distribution of G2 r and G2 v , but it also contains types from E3 v , F4 v and G3 r , all of which were previously found in case y. The simplest inference would be that for some reason Compositor A was working from case y at this point: there is one type from case x in I2 v : B 3 from D2 v . But by this time, what with proofing and other possible causes of type-movement (such as accidental pying or stripping accidents), we ought not to take too seriously the anomalous appearance of a type from so much earlier in the book. The problems increase in I3 r , which shares types from case x (C1 v , E1 r , E2 r ) and case y (F4 r , G2 r ). This page is undoubtedly of Compositor A's setting, and the likelihood, in view of the fact that G2 r types appeared in number in the previous page, is that both were set from the same case. If this is correct, it means that while each compositor still set four pages of the gathering, some printing-shop exigency led A to forsake his usual case; in consequence six of the eight pages in the gathering were set from case y. This being so, it is not unlikely that some signs of pending shortage of sorts led Compositor A to transfer various types from case x to case y to replenish it, thereby causing some mixing of the identified types. This does not seem an unlikely scenario: when it happens in my printing shop, I usually raid the case alongside, to even up the numbers, and I cannot see any reason why Okes's workmen should not have done likewise. In such circumstances it is best to be guided by the more recent types, when trying to decide which case was being used. For these reasons, I believe that I3 r was also set by Compositor A out of case y. For I3 v , Compositor A seems to have moved back to his usual case x, since the types in it do not conflict with any case y types. There are very few distinctive types in I4 r and I4 v , but what there are are not in any way inconsistent with their being set regularly, by B from y and by A from x. K1 r shares with I4 v the first types from inner H, H4 r , and was set by A from case x. K1 v (B-y) has types from H1 v , H3 v and I1 v on it, but only one (from E1 r ) from an earlier distribution. Although E1 r was an x page, we may appeal to the sharing of types already postulated to account for this single anomaly, as we may for the E1 v type in the next page but one, K2 v , otherwise regularly from case y; there are no problems in K2 r and K3 r , regular B-y pages. K3 v (A-x) however does contain an anomalous type from G4 r (y) whose presence I am at a loss to explain. Shared distribution will not account for it, for another type from the same line is found on I1 v , the page on which most of the G4 r types recur. There are various possible explanations, all of which entail stretching the long arm of coincidence: such as that type l 5, though I believed it to be reliably identified, is actually two types so identically damaged that they cannot be distinguished; or that some minor chance in the shop led to letter l 5 being dropped by compositor B and picked up and distributed into case x by compositor A, or that it was used from case y by the proof-reader in correcting K3 v . None of these hypotheses is impossible; none of them is susceptible of proof. K4 r is a normal A-x page, but an apparent problem arises on K4 v , on which we find types from both cases: from G3 r and G3 v (y), and from H2 v and H4 r (x). Both pages were set by compositor A, and while we have seen how types from case x could have been used to fill up short boxes in case y, it is difficult to see why the reverse procedure should have been required at this point. However, the recurrence from G3 v is a doubtful one, and we have already seen that Compositor A was setting from case y at I2 v ; it is therefore possible that the type from G3 r was returned by him to case x as part of the process of making proof-corrections in I2 v . Another problem occurs on L1 r , in all respects a normal B-y page, in which types from I2 r appear in some number. However, type long s 11 (also from I2 r ) has just appeared on K4 v (an A-x page) and another type from I2 r subsequently appears on L2 v . This last may be dismissed: the type occurs in the first part of the page, and was therefore set by B. But to account for long s 11, we will have to invoke some kind of coincidence similar to that required for type l 5 in page K3 v . And something similar must be appealed to for the presence on K3 v (A-x) of a type (n 20) from I1 r , which otherwise seems to have been distributed by B and used to set L1 v . These three somewhat intractable letters do not constitute an alarming amount of anomaly in view of the total numbers involved, and in any event effectively bring us to the end of the problems associated with the book. L2 r is a B-y page; the composition of L2 v was shared, and although it is likely that compositor A took over towards the end of the page, it is very difficult to say just where, or which case was in use at what time during this page. Compositor A's stint through the rest of gathering L uses types mainly from I2 v , I3 r , I3 v and I4 v , pages which had not been used before; there are also some types from other case x pages, and one anomalous type from case y (from G2 v , on L4 r ). But G is sufficiently far back that by the end of L some normal minor mixing of types would have occurred. The types that surface in the disputed gathering M are largely case y types, which strengthens the possibility (it cannot be called more) that despite the unusual spelling forms found therein, B might have set the first three pages of the gathering: there is a surprisingly large number of types from early gatherings, but also a few from I1 v and I2 r , both case y pages. To conclude, it is reasonably safe to generalize that while the earlier gatherings shared between Compositors A and B were very regularly divided, there seems to have been increasing irregularity in their working from the middle of gathering I onwards. At this point A set two pages from B's usual case, and evidently "borrowed" some types from his own usual case to replenish case y. Later, at L2 v , the compositors seem to have shared work on the page, and there are a few typographical anomalies in these later gatherings which elude simple explanation. Nonetheless, none of the difficulties with the evidence are so severe as to make it necessary to abandon the hypothesis that two compositors worked out of two cases for gatherings F-L of The White Devil .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion I do not by any means claim this study to be exhaustive. I have certainly not been able to duplicate the scale of the unprecedented researches Peter Blayney undertook into the Pide Bull quarto of King Lear . Within my more modest limits, however, I believe I have gone much further into the physical evidence than has any previous work on Webster, and I have attempted to examine all the bibliographical questions which could shed useful light on the composition and printing of The White Devil . If, after turning over all the stones (some of them mightily massive and slow to be turned, at that) little has been found under some of them, that is in the nature of bibliographical investigation. To say this is not to say that I am disappointed with the results, nor that the time spent in the investigation was not well-spent. On the contrary, I am satisfied that the actual editing of Webster can now proceed with a better appreciation of just how much information concerning Okes and his workmen's share in the production of the text exists, and can be textually exploited. What has been established, I hope beyond reasonable query, is first that compositor-determination in this quarto is unusually difficult because there are so many "concealed prose" lines—lines whose method of justification requires them to be treated as prose. Secondly, Philip Williams's division of the book's composition between two compositors in gatherings F-L holds up well (with only one page needing to be re-assigned, and another to be seen as divided between the workmen). However, his attribution of pages B-E and M is unreliable, and his belief that Compositor B set some of gathering B is surely mistaken. On balance, reviewing all the evidence contained in this article, it seems to me highly probable that a single workman, whom I have nominated Compositor N, set B-E (though the possibility that another compositor, different from A, B, and N, set some of the later pages of gathering E, when case y was being established, cannot be absolutely ruled out). The evidence of punctuation, spacing, and (to a much lesser extent) spelling, suggests that Compositor N and Compositor A shared many practices and preferences, but it does seem possible to discriminate between them on statistical grounds. Some further confirmation comes from the treatment of speech-prefixes. Thanks to Blayney's researches, we know that Okes tended to employ a variety of journeyman compositors, and, in the circumstances, the probability that more than two men could have worked on The White Devil is quite high; and the prospects of reaching absolute certainty in discriminating between them are not as good as one would like. This obviously has a bearing on assumptions made about compositors and their fidelity to copy when actually editing the text. Finally, thanks to an examination of damaged types perhaps more exacting than has hitherto been attempted, it has proved possible to trace the pattern of distribution and composition through gatherings F-L, thereby confirming the evidence of spelling and spacing. While this survey turned up some minor irregularities in the setting of later gatherings, by and large the quarto seems to have been printed very regularly. Perhaps one of the most valuable conclusions to be drawn from the exercise is that whereas the study of damaged types and their distribution and reappearance is a bibliographical tool of value, it will not in itself suffice to determine the compositors, or without some ambiguity, the precise order of setting. It is, in other words, a valuable tool, but not a panacea. It is also perhaps the most time-consuming and potentially frustrating bibliographical labor yet conceived, and should not be undertaken lightly in hope of easy and certain results.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX RECURRENT TYPES The following table lists all identified types in the first quarto. All lines on the page are counted (save the headline and blank lines), and the figure following the virgula indicates the precise letter within the line. Thus, to take the first example, B4 r (33/2) indicates that the first identifiable letter a occurs on B4 r , on the 33rd line, and it is the second a in that line. Where there is no virgula, there is only one such letter in the line. Corrected and uncorrected copies are indicated by "c" and "u". A query following the listing indicates a probable identification, but one which remains slightly uncertain even after examination of multiple copies; a double query indicates much the same degree of uncertainty, compounded by bad inking in all examined copies. An exclamation point indicates absolute certainty of identity. When no indication is given, it means that my investigations satisfy me that the types are the same, without being of that absolute certainty (usually a grossly damaged type) which would be beyond any question whatever (the group marked with a !). Altogether, this table lists the 734 appearances of 265 pieces of type in the quarto. I should add that while all reasonable care has been exerted to ensure that these listings are accurate, it has not been possible to re-check every item recorded here, and in the nature of such a job, it is likely that some errors of transcription and recording may have crept in. The listing is offered, then, as the lawyers says, E &amp; OE.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Trundle and the Book-Trade 1603-1626 by Gerald D. Johnson *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A catalogue of the books issued by John Trundle in the first decades of the seventeenth century would not have impressed the serious-minded reader of his own, or later, time. Here are no translations of the classics, no weighty folios of history or legend, not even any collections of sermons. Instead there are reports of sensational news, accounts of monsters and miracles, advice on "how to live," and sketches of rogues and murderers, together with ballads on similar subjects. There is a scattering of play titles, including the first, "bad" quarto of Hamlet , Middleton and Rowley's A Faire Quarrell and Dekker's The Whore of Babylon . There are as well some topical works by Dekker, and, later on, a few titles by John Taylor, the "water-poet." But the catalogue shows that Trundle devoted most of his twenty-three years in the trade to the publication of pamphlet literature meant to catch the eye of the lower-class reading public. Trundle missed few opportunities to exploit the public's taste for news of the current sensation. His rogues gallery exhibits several notable malefactors, including the famous highwayman Gamaliel Ratsey, and James Franklin and Anne Turner, agents in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. One of his "monsters," the famous serpent or dragon of Sussex, was still being referred to years after its original appearance in print. And one of his last publications recounts the adventures of Richard Peeke, later celebrated as "Dick of Devonshire." When the present scene failed him, he republished old stories with dates expunged or fresh dates inserted, or he offered translations of astonishing news from foreign lands. Of course, other publishers of this time brought out such titles and engaged in similar practices, but none of them seems to have cultivated this area as assiduously as did Trundle, and few of them gained Trundle's reputation for the publication of such items. Trundle's notoriety may be judged from the number of references to him in the contemporary literature. Ben Jonson, for example, in introducing topical references into the revision of Every Man in His Humour , has Edward Knowell refer to a letter sent to his father: "Well, if he read this with patience, Ile be gelt, and troll ballads for Mr. IOHN TRVNDLE, yonder, the rest of my mortalitie" (1.3.62-4, Herford and Simpson ed.). Like that of Nathaniel Butter, Trundle's name made a pun irresistible. Thus the anonymous author of Lachrymae Londinenses , 1626 (STC 16573), cautions the reader against the many "Spuriall Pamphlets, which the Presse hath of late already spewed out, (Broods of Barbican, Smithfield , and the Bridge , and Trundled, trolled and marshalled vp and downe along the Streets . . .)" (B2-2v, quoted by Wilson, Plague Pamphlets , pp. 245-246). And John Taylor, in Taylors Motto , 1621 (STC 23800), refers to the "monstrous newes [that] came Trundling in my way . . ." (E2v). That Trundle was not averse to such publicity is suggested by the fact that the latter title is one of his own publications (with Henry Gosson). So pervasive was Trundle's reputation that it outlived him for a number of years. Alexander Gill, in his satirical verses on Jonson's Magnetic Lady , advises that "As for the Press, yf thy Playe must Come toote; Let Thomas Purffoot or Iohn Trundell doo'te . . ." (Quoted in Herford and Simpson, 11:346-8). Gill was writing later than 1632, at least six years after Trundle's death. 1 Though Trundle cannot be seen as an important publisher, if that is measured by the number of significant intellectual or literary titles, his career is nonetheless of interest to a student of the book-trade. An analysis of his methods in the pursuit of manuscripts and his practices in bringing the editions to the public throws light upon the commercial negotiations involved in the transmission of texts. This area of the trade has received scant attention, at least during Trundle's time. As John Feather has remarked: "bibliographers have to study the book trade as a trade, and to try to recover some of the understanding of its commercial arrangements which were common knowledge among its members. To ignore this, is to ignore a factor which has always been central to the production of books: the factor of profit" (p. 8). Trundle published the majority of his books in collaboration with other stationers, though he also functioned independently in a few instances where books were concerned and usually in the production of ballads and broadsides. A study of his connections with his associates helps to define the areas of specialization that were appearing in the trade at this time. The following article on Trundle's career is divided into three parts. The first is biographical; the second examines his relationships with other stationers; and the third investigates his tactics in the pursuit of copy and comments on the publication history of some of his more interesting titles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I John Trundle, the "sonne of John Trundell late of Barnet in the county of Hertford yoman Deceased," was apprenticed to Ralph Hancock, stationer, for a period of eight years from 24 June 1589, the contract being recorded on 26 March 1590. 2 This delay in recording the apprenticeship evidently got Hancock into trouble, for on this same date he was fined three shillings, four pence, "for kepinge a prentise vnpresented, contrary to order" (Arber, 2:862). If Trundle was at the usual age of twenty-four when he became a freeman in 1597, he must have been born about 1573. The parish register of Chipping Barnet, held at the Hertfordshire County Hall, Hertford, contains no baptismal records earlier than 1603, and, though some transcripts do survive, there is a gap between 1570-1574. The original register, however, does record the marriage of a John Trundle and a Joan (last name unrecorded) on 7 October 1565. This John Trundle was buried on 27 March 1577, after which his widow, Joan Trundle, remarried a Robert Law on 7 October 1577. The inventory of the goods and chattels of this John Trundle shows that he was not a wealthy man. The total worth of his estate amounted to thirteen pounds, eleven shillings. He must have been a trader in livestock and/or cured meat, for prominent in the inventory are "fyve kyne" valued at six pounds, a "weaninge calfe" at six shillings, a "nagge" at sixteen shillings, and twenty-four "flitches of bacon" at four pounds. Joan Trundle made her mark at the foot of this document (Hertforshire County Hall, Ms A25/881). Trundle, presented by Hancock, took up his freedom on 29 October 1597 (Arber, 2:720). He had married Margery Parton some two years earlier, on 4 September 1595, in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, where Hancock's shop was apparently located. 3 The register of this parish also records the christening of "Elizabeth, daughter of Iohn Trundell, prynter" on 15 November 1599 and her burial thirteen days later. On 27 December 1600, another "Elizabeth, daughter of Iohn Trundell, stationer" was christened in this parish (Miller, p. 35). I was unable to find any records of Trundle in this or adjacent parishes for the years 1600-1624, although imprints of books during this period suggest that the Trundles continued to live there (see below). In 1624 Trundle rented space from St. Bartholomew's Hospital, in the area known as West Smithfield, just outside the Hospital Gate, for which he paid a fee of three pounds. The General Accounts Ledger of the hospital notes this payment annually through 1628. The parish register of St. Bartholomew's the Less, however, records the burial of "John Trundle London Stationer" on 12 December 1626. The administration of his goods and chattels, by his widow Margery, was recorded in January 1627 (Guildhall Library, Ms 9050/6, folio 22). I was unfortunately unable to find an inventory of his property. Margery Trundle carried on the business from the Smithfield address for the next two years, which explains the continued payment of the rent. The parish register records her burial on 9 April 1629. The business evidently did not prosper in her hands. The Churchwarden's Account Book records a charitable payment of twelve shillings to her in 1629, and she died indebted to the English Stock. On 4 May 1629 the Court of the Stationers' Company allowed the ballad partners to pay this debt in return for the rights to her copies (Jackson, p. 210). On 1 June 1629 the Register records the payment of four pounds, seventeen shillings, eight pence, in return for six books and twenty-four ballads "Together with all other Booke and Ballades. that belonged of Right to the said Marg. Trundle" (Arber, 4:213). Given the nature of Trundle's business, it is not surprising that he did not distinguish himself in the Company. He was apparently never elected to the Livery, nor did he serve in any official capacity. On the other hand, he was a relatively law-abiding member. He was fined only three times: in 1605, for keeping an apprentice past the normal term (Jackson, p. 438. The apprentice was apparently "Willm Butler"; see McKenzie, p. 128); in 1614 for printing a book without entrance (Jackson, p. 68 and p. 455); and in 1619 "for being absent the last q r day" (Jackson, p. 464). His name also appears in the records as one of the petitioners against the Boislore-Wood-Symcock patent (Greg, Companion , p. 168). In 1603 Trundle set up shop "in Barbican, neere Long lane end" (imprint in STC 16743.3). In 1606, coincidental with his entrance of "The picture of No bodye" (Arber, 3:308) and his publication of the play Nobody and Somebody , he introduced the "signe of No-body" to distinguish his shop in Barbican ( BEPD , #229). According to imprints, he remained at this location through 1620 (STC 13507, 1613; STC 11089 and 17386.5, 1615; STC 20744, 1616; STC 25292, 1620). In 1623 his address is also given as "att the nobodye in Barbican" in the bill filed by Gervase Markham against a number of defendants who had allegedly reneged on their subscription to him (quoted in Bentley, 2:682-3). In 1624, as described above, Trundle moved to Smithfield, at the Hospital Gate (imprints in STC 17308.5, 1624; STC 6520 and 20823, 1625; STC 19529, 1626. STC 10412, 23239, and 19278 are undated but bear this imprint or variations of it). The sign of Nobody was, however, still associated with Trundle after 1624. The anonymous authors of The Run-awyaes [ sic ] Answer (STC 24562, 1625), in their preface, " intreate Some-Body to step to No-Body in Smithfield, neere the Hospitall Gate . . ." (A3). 4 Many of the publications in which Trundle had a part were, however, not sold at his shop but at those of his associates, as will be described below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II There are problems in attempting to reconstruct the practices of any publisher of this period, but a publisher like Trundle compounds the difficulty. The topical and ephemeral subject matter of most of his publications meant that later reprints and assignments of titles were seldom warranted. Thus, in the instances of shared publication, it is often not possible to deduce the conditions under which the titles were issued. Moreover, perhaps also due to subject matter, some of the editions issued by him exist in one or two copies only, often themselves defective in title-pages or imprints; and other titles, registered to him, have apparently perished altogether. 5 Nevertheless, the evidence that does exist is sufficient for certain inferences to be drawn, of varying degrees of probability. For example, as mentioned above, a characteristic of Trundle's publishing practice is that he often found it expedient, or necessary, to form connections with other stationers in publishing and distributing editions of books. He did issue several editions independently, 6 but, of the forty-three titles that I have been able to trace, no fewer than thirty-two were produced in association with another stationer or stationers. Most of this copy was entered in the Registers, either by Trundle alone (twenty-two titles) or jointly (nine titles). In seven instances of joint registration (not including The Fleer , which Trundle assigned before publication), Trundle's name is omitted from the imprints of the editions. In only one example did he, according to the imprint, have a part in a copy that was entered to another stationer alone, and in no instance was copy entered jointly then sold at Trundle's shop. This pattern suggests immediately that Trundle's main interest, or talent, lay in the location of manuscripts which he then published and distributed on a share basis. 7 With regard to distribution, the pattern is even more striking. Thirty-three of the editions give an address of sale in their imprints; of these, twenty-six denote a shop identified with another stationer. (This total includes one edition issued with two title-pages, one of which gives Trundle's name and address.) Since there is good evidence that Trundle had a shop of his own, there must have been other reasons for this practice. The fact that two of the booksellers involved, John Hodgets and Edward Marchant, owned shops in St. Paul's Churchyard, the center of the book-trade, suggests that location was a factor. Trundle may have felt that his shop, in Barbican, would not attract the custom of those in a more popular location. There may have been other factors as well. Most of the men who sold books for Trundle were engaged in this end of the business. They were to varying degrees specialists and must therefore have operated efficient book-keeping and distribution systems. Their skills relieved Trundle, and their other patrons, of these concerns. Though the profit margin for Trundle must have been reduced, the trade-off was worth it. This pattern is not, however, apparent in Trundle's dealings in ballads and broadsides. I have managed to trace copies of thirty such titles published by him. (I have seen examples of all but two of these.) Since most of this copy was not registered, he probably published many other titles that have perished or that have not as yet been catalogued. Of the extant editions, however, in only four instances is it evident that he worked with an associate. 8 Moreover, the eleven imprints which give a place of sale specify his shop. This contrasting practice suggests that he was not only able to meet the relatively nominal charges for publishing single sheet folios but that his shops, in Barbican and then in Smithfield, were suitably located for the dissemination of such material. He probably not only employed ballad sellers (as Jonson's reference to him suggests) but also wholesaled ballads to hawkers like Nightingale, especially during Fair time. Trundle's relationships with his associates in the book copy fall roughly into a chronological series. During the years 1603-1608, he formed connections with several of them in one or two publications. These include Nicholas Ling, Edward Allde, Nathaniel Butter, Eleazar Edgar, John Hodgets, and John Busby, Senior. There is no record of activity during 1609-1611. (He made one entrance in 1609. See note 5.) In 1612-1613, his principal collaborator was Edward Marchant. From 1614 to 1623, he worked mainly with Henry Gosson and John and Edward Wright, and, in one instance each, with George Eld, Phillip Birch, and George Purslowe. In the final years of his career, after he had set up in Smithfield, he published at least two editions independently. Some of these men, such as Ling, Butter, Gosson, and John Wright, were active publishers who regularly entered copy and published editions to be sold at their shops, though John Wright and his brother Edward also sold editions for other stationers. (For Ling's practices, see Johnson, "Nicholas Ling.") Allde and Purslowe were trade printers who mainly printed for other stationers but who, from time to time, entered copy and published it. Busby was primarily a manuscript scout: he often entered titles which were then printed "for" another publisher, though he, unlike Trundle, apparently never owned a shop of his own. (See Johnson, "John Busby.") Edgar, too, at least in the early years of his career, sold the titles that he had entered at shops belonging to others. On the other hand, Hodgets and Marchant were principally booksellers. They made few entrances of copy, but they regularly sold editions for other stationers. Trundle's relations with these men were probably predicated upon the kind of business that the collaborator ran. For example, Nicholas Ling presumably financed the publication of Hamlet and in return not only shared the profits but later claimed the copyright. (See below for a discussion of this publication.) A similar arrangement is likely to have obtained in other connections. Trundle registered Sir Thomas Smithes Voyage on 27 September 1605 (Arber, 3:302). The edition was then printed for Nathaniel Butter, whose interest in such news books is well known, in the same year (STC 22869 and .3). Trundle and Butter jointly entered The Whore of Babylon on 20 April 1607 ( BEPD , p. 22). This play was then printed for Butter ( BEPD , #241). 9 The trade printers probably undertook to print editions for a share in the profits. Edward Allde, Trundle, and Joseph Hunt entered Oxfords Triumph on 19 September 1605 (Arber, 3:301) with Allde printing the edition "to bee sold in Paules Church-yard by Iohn Hodgets. 1605." (STC 18589). On 4 July 1620 George Purslowe and Trundle registered The World Tost at Tennis ( BEPD , p. 32). Purslowe then printed the play to be sold by Edward Wright ( BEPD , #365, two issues). The Artillery Garden probably also fits into this category. Trundle entered this title on 29 November 1615 (Arber, 3:578). The imprint of the single surviving copy reads: "Imprinted at London by G. Eld 1616." (STC 6475.5) In these instances, however, the absence of reprints or assignments in later years makes it impossible to know whether the arrangement included an assumption of the copyright. Trundle's relationship with Eleazar Edgar is slightly more complicated. These two entered The Double PP on 9 December 1605 (Arber, 3:307); the edition, however, was printed by Thomas Creede to be sold by Hodgets. (STC 6498. See below for a discussion of the two issues of this publication.) On 7 November 1607 Trundle registered A Bloody Tragedy (Arber, 3:364), which was then printed for "E. E. and are to be sold at the little shop at the Exchange. 1607." 10 During the years 1603-1608, Edgar regularly entered titles, either jointly or alone, that were sold at someone else's shop, 11 but not, in the above instances, at Trundle's shop. The attraction of Hodget's shop in St. Paul's Churchyard has already been mentioned, and the Exchange was another popular place of resort for those seeking the latest news item. 12 There is no evidence that these titles were reprinted. They do not appear in the transference of copies to Hodgets from Edgar in 1613 where his share in various copyrights is carefully denominated (Arber, 3:520-21), but their absence may simply mean that they had no further value. John Hodgets sold two editions for Trundle in addition to the ones noticed above. The Isle of Gulls was not entered, but the original state of the title-page (according to Greg) bears the imprint: "Printed for Iohn Trundle, and are to be sold by Iohn Hodgets in Paules Church-yard. 1606." 13 This imprint occurs in one copy only; in the other surviving copies Trundle's name is omitted. In 1608 Hodgets sold The Dead Terme (STC 6496), which Trundle had entered on 3 November 1607 (Arber, 3:363). The records show that Hodgets functioned mainly as a bookseller during 1601-1608. He entered only four titles during these years, but he sold ten editions that had been entered by other stationers. He also sold four editions of titles that had not been entered but in which the imprint reads either "for" another stationer to be "sold by" Hodgets or simply "sold by" Hodgets. 14 Trundle made two entries jointly with John Busby, Senior. They entered The Fleer conditionally on 13 May 1606. Trundle then assigned his rights in this play to Busby and Arthur Johnson on 21 November 1606, simultaneously with the approval to print ( BEPD , pp. 21-22). The other title, The Life and Execution of Charles Courtney , which Trundle and Busby entered on 13 March 1612 (Arber, 3:479), was printed "for Edward Marchant, and are to bee sold in Pau[ls] Churceyard [ sic ] ouer against the Crosse. 1612" (STC 5878), the address of Marchant's shop. Trundle worked with Marchant in five additional publications during 1612-1615. The play If It Be not Good was not entered; it was printed for "I. T." to be sold by Marchant "at his shop against the Crosse in Pauls Church-yarde. 1612" ( BEPD , #305). The other copies were all entered by Trundle, and three of them were printed "for" Marchant to be sold at his shop: Witches Apprehended , entered on 23 January 1613 (Arber, 3:514, STC 25872); The . . . Cousenages of John West , entered on 30 January 1613 (Arber, 3:514, STC 25261.5); and A Marriage Triumph , entered on 15 February 1613 (Arber, 3:515, STC 13355). The other title, A Nunnes Prophesie , was entered by Trundle on 13 February 1615 (Arber, 3:564); its imprint omits Trundle's name but reads "to be sold" by Marchant (STC 18747). Despite the discrepancy in those imprints reading "for" Marchant, there is little doubt that he was acting as the bookseller. There are no reprints or assignments that might resolve this question, but a study of Marchant's practices shows that he functioned generally as a bookseller. He made only three entrances during 1612-1616, and two of these were for ballads. On the other hand, he sold seven editions that had been registered to others and five which had not been entered but in which the imprint reads "for" another stationer to be sold by Marchant. 15 A fairly common practice of the period was for publishers sharing the distribution of certain editions to have printed title-pages with variant imprints giving first one then the other name and address, or to have separate title-pages printed, some of which were used as cancels. Marchant, for example, often worked in this fashion (see note 15), but not, so far as available evidence indicates, with Trundle. There are only two surviving instances of such a practice in Trundle's work, and neither of them is a regular example. On 22 April Trundle entered The Bible-bearer (Arber, 3:347). The edition was then printed under that title "for I. C. [Jeffrey Chorlton] and are to be sold at the North doore of Paules. 1607" (STC 18495). One extant copy, however, exhibits a cancel title-page giving the title as Two Faces Under a Hood , with the imprint "Printed for Iohn Trundle dwelling in Barbican. 1607" (STC 18495.5). The variant title suggests that distribution may not have been the primary, or only, reason for the existence of the cancel title-page. The other example, also irregular, is the variant imprint in The Isle of Gulls , described above. Both imprints in this play, however, specify that Hodgets is the seller. It is of course possible that other editions were issued in this manner and that the variants or cancels giving Trundle's name and address have perished. This may especially be suspected in those instances in which an edition is represented by one or two extant copies. For example, the single surviving copy of The Hunting of the Pox , entered by Trundle on 19 February 1619 (Arber, 3:642), was printed for "I. T. and are to be sold by Philip Birch at the signe of the Bible neere Guildhall-gate. 1619" (STC 23624.7). If such were the case, however, Trundle's dependence upon others to help with distribution would still be apparent. In the final decade of his career, Trundle was associated with Henry Gosson, also an active publisher of pamphlets, broadsides, and ballads. These two registered Newes of Sir Walter Rauleigh on 17 March 1618 (Arber, 3: 623). The edition was then printed "for H. G. and are to be sold by I. Wright, at the signe of the Bible without New-gate. 1618" (STC 17148 and .3). On 12 June 1621 Trundle entered Daniel Ben Alexander (Arber, 4:56), which was printed by Allde for Gosson "to be sould in Panniar-Ally [ sic ]. 1621" (STC 6266). Taylors Motto was entered to Gosson on 18 June 1621 (Arber, 4:56), but the edition was printed "for I T &amp; H G" (STC 23800 and .5). This is apparently the single example of Trundle's name, or initials, occurring in the imprint of a book entered independently by another stationer. Trundle and Gosson jointly entered The Unnatural Father on 10 July 1621 (Arber, 4:57) with the edition being printed for "I.T. and H.G." (STC 23808a). In 1622 they published The Lawyers Philosophy without entrance; the imprint reads "printed for I. T. and H. G. and are to bee sold at the Widdow Gossons in Pannier Alley." 16 They registered Prince Charles his Welcome on 7 October 1623 (Arber, 4:105), which was then printed for John Wright to be sold at his shop (STC 23789.7). According to imprints, they also shared in the publication of two ballads; and in 1636 Gosson reprinted the broadside The Red-Cross , which Trundle had published earlier (STC 20824. See below for a discussion of the several issues of this title.). Trundle's work with Gosson is more suggestive of a partnership than is any of the other associations. The joint entries and the occurrence of both names in imprints are not typical of Trundle's involvement with other publishers. But here again none of the imprints gives Trundle's shop as the place of sale. Instead the editions were sold out of one of Gosson's or at the shop of John Wright. John Wright, or his brother Edward, sold several editions for Trundle in addition to those indicated above. A Miracle, of Miracles , which Trundle entered on 15 November 1613 (Arber, 3:537), was printed for him "to be sold at Christ Church gate. 1614" (STC 14068). The imprint reads the same in Anthony Painter , entered by Trundle on 21 January 1614 (Arber, 3:540; STC 19120). A Faire Quarrell was not entered but was printed "for I. T. and are to bee sold at Christ Church Gate. 1617" ( BEPD , #352). In 1620 Hic Mulier (STC 13374) and Haec Vir (STC 12599), entered by Trundle on 9 and 16 February 1620, respectively (Arber 3:665), and Jack a Lent , 2nd edition (STC 23765.5), not entered, bear this imprint. There are two editions of The Life and Death of . . . the Virgin Mary (not entered): the imprint of STC 23770 reads: "Printed at London by G. E. and are to be sold at Christchurch gate. 1620", while that of STC 23771 reads merely "Printed at London by G. E. for I. T. 1622." (This title was among those assigned from the estate of Margery Trundle on 1 June 1629.) The Life and Death of G. Flood , not entered, was printed "for I. T. " and was sold at the Bible without Newgate in 1623 (STC 11090). Altogether, then, the Wrights sold eleven editions for Trundle or for him and one of his associates, and they sold numerous editions for other stationers. 17 Apparently they ran an effective distribution system from their shops near Christ Church and Newgate. This survey of Trundle's career shows that he was responsible for procuring most of the copy for the publications in which he was involved and that he relied upon collaborators to help bring many of these titles to the public. His associates who were themselves independent publishers probably financed or shared the financing of publication costs. In some of these instances it is likely that Trundle traded his copyright for a share of the proceeds, though only in the case of Hamlet is there evidence that his associate actually assumed the copyright. But what of his arrangements with those who were primarily booksellers, like Hodgets and Marchant, or who ran a distribution service as a side-line, like John Wright? In general terms the advantage that they offered to a publisher like Trundle is easy to see. Publishers of topical and sensational pamphlets needed a rapid turn-over, for these items went quickly out of currency. Unsold sheets not only tied up capital but might also lead to losses. Quick distribution was probably of as much concern to such publishers as the paper and printing costs of a three or four sheet quarto. Hence Trundle got his wares into the hands of booksellers who specialized in this end of the trade, men whose shops and distribution networks offered a better chance for quick sales. Trundle's relationship with these men invites comparison with that between certain publishers (called "booksellers") and booksellers (called "trade publishers") that occurred towards the end of the century. These "trade publishers," as described by Michael Treadwell, "only rarely entered works to themselves in the registers" while works bearing their imprints had often been entered by other stationers (p. 116). Their services were used mainly by the "copy-right owning booksellers" for the two motives, according to Treadwell, of "concealment and convenience" (p. 120). They dealt largely in topical pamphlets, often of a political or religious nature, items that had to be sold quickly. They relieved the publisher of the worry of distributing and keeping accounts for these ephemeral items, for which service the publisher paid them a fee for each copy sold, calculated apparently as the difference between the wholesale and retail prices (pp. 121-123, 126). It was also a part of their function "to stand mute between the real proprietors and the authorities in time of any slight unpleasantness" (p. 125), though ultimately the printer and copyright owner were at risk (p. 131). Trundle's arrangement with booksellers may have been upon similar terms. He may have turned over the copies of an edition to them, which they then sold at the retail price from their own shops and perhaps also wholesaled to other booksellers both in London and in the provinces. They kept the accounts of sales, and when these had run their course settled the account with Trundle. The factor of convenience for Trundle is apparent, but what of concealment? Did his booksellers stand as a buffer between him and possible trouble with the authorities? Here, of course, the tenuous parallel with the "trade publisher" of the later era breaks down, for Treadwell conjectures that the political unrest of the 1680's, together with the lapsing of the Licensing Act in 1679, led to the appearance of that specialist. Through his services, the copyright owner could exploit the market for political and religious controversy without having his name associated, at least publically, with the books (pp. 129-131). But it is difficult to see how a publisher in Trundle's time could hope to evade responsibility by this ruse, especially if his name were on record at Stationers' Hall as the enterer of the title. However, Greg does suspect that Trundle "rather meanly" removed his name from the imprint of The Isle of Gulls , leaving Hodgets to take the heat of any consequences due to the topical allusions in the play ("The Two Issues of Day's Isle of Gulls , 1606," p. 307). This play, of course, was not entered, and Trundle's connection with it, at least to our eyes, appears only from the one extant copy with his name in the imprint. But surely this was not the only copy issued with this imprint, and one wonders why, if Trundle was truly concerned, he let any of them out. Moreover, the Stationers' Company did succeed in fixing responsibility for publication even in instances when the copy was not entered and when the responsible party's name does not appear in the imprint, as for example when Allde, Trundle, and Snodham were fined for a book that bears Butter's name in the imprint (see note 9). On the whole, it seems more likely that Trundle's name was removed from the imprint for some other reason, perhaps because it was seen to have no advertising value (compare The Dead Term and Trundle's practice with Marchant). 18</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Although few of Trundle's titles are of intrinsic interest as literature, investigating the publication history of some of them does throw light on his methods, at times none too scrupulous, in the pursuit of manuscripts. Enough speculation already exists concerning the publication of Hamlet not to need addition here. However, it is worth remarking that Trundle's practices, at least later in his career, and the contrasting habits of Ling, who regularly financed the publication of copy for other stationers, support the conjecture that it was Trundle who came into the possession of this manuscript. It is moreover difficult to see how otherwise he could have gained a share in its publication. One other circumstance is worthy of notice. Since much has been made of the connections between James Roberts and Ling, not only in the fact that Roberts printed the second edition of the play for Ling but also that he was and continued to be Ling's favorite printer, it should be noted that he also appears to have printed for Trundle. The first of these printings is of interest both with regard to this connection and for what it reveals of Trundle's methods early in his career. On 27 July 1603 Trundle made his first entry in the Register, for "A Relation of many visitations by the plague &amp;c." (Arber, 3:243), which shows that he already aimed to capitalize on current events. There is, however, no record of a publication with exactly this title. Instead there are two extant issues of a plague bill entitled A true bill of the whole number that hath died in the Cittie of London . . . . One issue (STC 16743.2) covers deaths to "October the sixt day, 1603" and is signed "Henry Chettle"; the other (STC 16743.3) is unsigned and presents the statistics to "October the 20. day." The imprint on both issues reads: "At London printed by I. R. for Iohn Trundle, and are to be sold at his shop in Barbican, neere Long lane end." Wilson says that this bill was "piratically" printed ( The Plague in London , p. 192, n. 3), evidently because it infringed the patent granted to John Windet on 1 August 1603 for "the billes of suche as Dye and are buried this yere of the plague and other sicknesses. . ." (Arber, 3:243). But this bill also includes, as the sub-title indicates, "a relation of many visitations by the plague, in sundry other forraine Countries," in the form of brief notices of the ravages of the plague from Roman times, accounting for approximately half of the text. Had this publication been challenged (there is no record that Windet protested), Trundle could thus have cited his entrance of 27 July as at least a specious defense. At some point it occurred to him that he might improve sales by appending statistics of the current plague to this text, which also meant that the same text could be published weekly with updated statistics. 19 If Roberts indeed printed this bill, as the initials indicate, and if RSTC is correct in ascribing to his press the 1606 print of the play Nobody and Somebody for Trundle, then Trundle resorted to Roberts's print-shop in Barbican at about the same time as and later than the initial publication of Hamlet . 20 Apparently Roberts held no grudge against either Ling or Trundle, the putative filcher of the manuscript, over this apparent infringement of copyright. Other instances, however, show Trundle taking more conventional routes for the acquisition of copy. He was involved in the publication of six (perhaps seven) titles of the works of Thomas Dekker, including two plays. 21 These manuscripts were apparently acquired from the author. The Double PP , 1606, was published anonymously, but Dekker wrote a dedication for a separate issue of this work (STC 6498 and .5). He also wrote dedications for The Dead Terme , 1608 (STC 6496), The Artillery Garden , 1616 (STC 6475.5), and A Rod for Run-aways , 1625 (STC 6520, two editions). The two plays were also evidently published with Dekker's consent. He wrote an address, "Lectori," for The Whore of Babylon , 1607 ( BEPD , #241) and a dedication for If It Be not Good , 1612 ( BEPD , #305). Most of Trundle's other plays also were apparently procured from authorized sources, though whether from the author or the acting company is not always clear. 22 The address "To the Reader and Hearer" in The Fleer , 1607 (entered by Trundle jointly but assigned before publication), implies that the play was published with the knowledge of the author, Edward Sharpham ( BEPD , #255). A Faire Quarrell , 1617 ( BEPD , #352), bears a dedication from William Rowley. The second issue of this play, however, includes an added scene of "M r . Chaughs and Trimtrams Roaring, and the Bauds Song," comic material that must have been a feature of the stage production. Middleton, in his dedication to The World Tost at Tennis , 1620 ( BEPD , #365), avers that this masque was "brought to the press rather by the printer than the poet. . . ." Jo. Cook's Greenes Tuquoque , 1614 ( BEPD , #323), may have come from the acting company. The wording of Thomas Heywood's epistle for this play suggests that Cook was dead. Heywood also states that he cannot "tell whether this worke was diuulged with [Cook's] consent or no: but howsoeuer, since it hath past the Test of the stage with so generall an applause, pitty it were but it should likewise haue the honour of the Presse." Of the play copy (excluding Hamlet ), only The Isle of Gulls , 1606 ( BEPD , #235 and Nobody and Somebody , 1606 ( BEPD , #229) contain no evidence of provenance, though the former of these appears to have been set from an authorial manuscript (Harrison, p. ix). The only other author for whom Trundle published several titles was John Taylor. Trundle brought out five titles by this prolific author during the years 1620-1623, two independently and three in association with Henry Gosson. His connection with Taylor was probably through Gosson, who was one of Taylor's favorite publishers. Beginning in 1612, Gosson published at least thirty-four of Taylor's works. In the light of the above, Shaaber's characterization of Trundle as a "busy miracle-monger and father of lies" (p. 291) seems both overly dramatic and ungenerous. But Shaaber has in mind several "news" pamphlets published by Trundle between 1607 and 1615. The most famous of these was True and Wonderful , 1614, by "A. R.," which reports the appearance, near Horsham in Sussex, of a "monstrous serpent (or Dragon)" that had slain "Men and Cattell, by his strong and violent poyson" (STC 20569). It may be significant that Trundle's entry of this title included the "Caution that if any exceptions be taken he shall stand to the perrill thereof himself" (Arber, 3:553), though it is not clear exactly what risk was involved. The imprint is, however, both laconic and misleading: "Printed at London, by John Trundle." (RSTC identifies the printer as Allde.) Shaaber calls this story "as gross an imposture as cynicism or credulity ever practised" (p. 239). Apparently "A. R." was himself concerned about the reception of his tale, for in his address "To the Reader" (A3-3v), he observes that "the iust Reward of him that is accustomed to lie, is, not to be belieu'd when he speaketh the truth." As well as reporting frightening news, however, the book has a didactic and moralistic purpose. It opens with a long preamble citing the appearances of dragons in history and legend, with numerous quotes in Latin (immediately translated), and the dragon itself is interpreted as one of those progidies of nature like "an Eclips or fearefull Comet" sent as a warning to sinful man "of some Serpentine sinnes that liue amongst vs." Whether this story evoked a frisson or a chuckle is doubtful, but the "dragon" was certainly memorable. Ben Jonson refers to it in News from the New World (acted 1620); Richard Brathwait mentions it in 1631; and a ballad of 1652 promises: "heer's no Sussex Serpent to fright you here in my Bundle, nor was it e-ver Printed for the Widdow Trundle ." 23 Another book of this nature is Fire from Heauen , 1613, by John Hilliard (STC 13507), which purports to tell the story of how one John Hitchell, of Southampton, was miraculously "consumed to ashes, and no fire seene." But, as Shaaber notices, this story is actually only a detail "tucked away among twenty pages of unabashed homilectics" (p. 204). Shaaber infers from this and other examples that the publishers regularly wrote the title-pages for their publications and that they emphasized the sensational as a selling point (p. 214). This detailed title-page, for example, admonishes the prospective reader to " Reade and tremble ." 24 However, Trundle did append to this book an account of a literal fire that had laid waste the town of Dorchester. More seriously, Shaaber shows that Trundle republished old news reports with dates omitted or current dates inserted. Trundle did not enter the copy for Three Bloodie Murders , 1613 (STC 18287). As Shaaber establishes, the first of these murder cases, that of W. Storre, is a reprint of STC 23295, published by J. Barnes at Oxford in 1603. In the reprint, "the text of the 1603 edition is faithfully followed, even down to the testimonials of good character, except all the tell-tale dates are omitted" (pp. 290-291). The other two cases are dated 2 July 1613 and are apparently current. Another example of this practice is A Miracle of Miracles , 1614, by "I. T." This book contains a tale of a headless bear that afflicted a woman in Somerset, a tale of a country maid in Germany who supposedly died and then revived to prophesy to her family and neighbors, and an account of a flood in Lincolnshire (STC 14068 and .3). Of these, Trundle had entered only the latter, with the proviso that it is "to be printed when it is further allowed" (Arber, 3:357). Shaaber identifies the headless bear tale as a reprint of STC 5681, printed for Thomas Nelson in 1584; and his conjecture that the story of the German maid is also an old story is quite correct (pp. 291-292). RSTC points out that this tale is a reprint of STC 21818, which William Wright had published in 1580. In both of these accounts, Trundle changed the dates to give the tales new currency. In this regard, it is amusing to note that the tale of the headless bear resurfaced in 1641 under a new title and with the victim's name changed. 25 Trundle also updated foreign news items himself. For example, he entered a report of the blasphemer Anthony Painter on 21 January 1614 as "translated out of ffrench" (Arber, 3:540). The title-page states that Painter "dyed the 3. of November . 1613" (STC 19120. The title-page is reproduced in Shaaber, p. 145.). This account is based on Punition Exemplaire et Ivgement de Dieu contre Antonine Panetier (British Library, shelf-mark 5423.aa. 24.[1]). This title-page does not date Painter's death, but the book was published in Paris not later than "29. Aoust 1613" and is itself a translation of an earlier Italian version. Both books also include the case of another blasphemer, Nicholas le Mesle. His execution is dated "le 27. iour de Ianuier 1599" in the original and "27. of Ianuarie 1613" in Trundle's version. Trundle evidently resorted to this practice when contemporary events offered no newsworthy items or when some other publisher had already cornered the market. The competition for such items is apparent. Trundle and Busby entered the report of the apprehension, arraignment, and execution of Charles Courtney on 13 March 1612, conditional upon "sufficient further aucthority." The condition was probably due to the fact that they were anticipating the event, for the next entry, of a ballad on the same subject to John Wright, indicates that Courtney was executed on 14 March (Arber, 3:479). Another instance affords a glimpse of publishers scurrying after a lucrative item. On 27 September 1605, Trundle entered a report of the merchant Sir Thomas Smith's "ambassage" to Russia. The entrance is conditional, the copy "to be staid . . . till he bringe further aucthority for yt." But a note appended indicates that the entrance is allowed by "m r Norton" (Arber, 3:302). The edition was then printed "for Nathanyell Butter. 1605" (STC 22869 and .3). This pamphlet recounts events at the Russian court, including "the tragicall ends of two Emperors [one of them Boris Godonov], and one Empresse. . . ." According to the unsigned address "To the Reader," the copy was put together from reports and notes "without consent either of Sir. Tho. himselfe, or of those gentlemen my friends that deliuered it unto me. . . ." Moreover, it appears that several such reports had been cobbled together, for, the address continues, "many way-laid the Newes . . . so that their heads being gotten with child of a Bastard, there was no remedy but they must be deliuered in Paules Church-yard." Apparently Trundle had beat his competitors to the Hall without taking time to get his copy properly licensed and was refused positive entrance until this detail could be cleared to the satisfaction of the warden. 26 If Butter wrote this address, then he may be referring to Trundle as one of the "way-layers." There is no record, however, that Trundle protested Butter's publication, which, together with their later association, suggests that the two reached an agreement. Another news event which spurred competition among several publishers was the trials of the perpetrators in the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury. Shaaber lists fifteen titles associated with the Overbury case, involving eleven different publishers (pp. 142-143). 27 Trundle issued or entered five titles concerning the malefactors. The first of his entries (missed by Shaaber) shows him closely following the course of events. He entered "The reward of the adulterer and adulteresse paid by gods owne hand," on 19 November 1615, with the approval of an official licenser (Arber, 3:577). No copy of this title has survived, but it apparently referred to the executions of the criminals in that month. A note at the conclusion of The Iust Downfall (STC 18919.7) calls the reader's attention to it as " a little Table, called the Spectacles . . ." (D4v). It was evidently a woodcut accompanied by text. Trundle's titles were not "news" in any strict sense but purported first-person accounts of the "repentances" and "tears" of the criminals. The lag between the event and the entrance suggests that there may have been a delay in getting some of the items licensed, perhaps due to the implications to high-ranking nobility. For example, Trundle entered "A little poeme called Mistris Turnores teares" on 29 November 1615 (Arber, 3:579), fifteen days after Anne Turner's execution. On 19 December 1615 Butter entered a report of the speech that Sir Jervis Elwes made at his execution on 20 November; this entry is followed by Trundle's for a ballad "of the same matter" (Arber, 3:580). However, Trundle did publish two single sheet folios of verses without entrance: Mistris Turners Farewell to All Women (STC 24341.5) and Iames Franklin . . . His Owne Arraignment (STC 11332.5. A related title was published by Henry Gosson, STC 11332). As well as exploiting current events, Trundle also responded to popular controversies. Two of his most interesting pamphlets Hic Mulier: Or, The Man-Woman (STC 13374, two editions) and Haec-Vir: Or The Womanish-Man (STC 12599) are his contributions to the argument concerning the position of women, a controversy sparked, in the press at least, by Joseph Swetnam's The Araignment of Lewd, Idle, Froward and Unconstant Women , 1615 (STC 23533, et. seq.). This tract went through ten editions during 1615-1637 and prompted a host of answers and rebuttals (see RSTC). Trundle registered his first title on February 9; the second followed a week later and is a reply to the first (Arber, 3:665). The closeness of these entries suggests to Wright "that the reply was already in manuscript and that the two were designed as a bookseller's effort to capitalize on popular interest in both sides of the controversy" (p. 494). Wright has high praise for Haec Vir : it is "a vigorous dialogue, at times eloquent in the sincere defense of woman's right to personal freedom" (p. 495), and "the Areopagitica of the London woman. . ." (p. 497). Both pamphlets are anonymous, but, according to the editor of the facsimile edition of the tracts, the "differences in style and attitude indicate that two writers were involved." This editor suggests that "Trundle may have commissioned them as a contribution to the continuing argument set off by" Swetnam's tract. 28 Some of Trundle's other titles fit roughly into Shaaber's "feature story" category (p. 160). Whereas several of these emphasize the sensational or moralistic elements of the story, others are straight-forward reports of events. For example, Anthony Nixon's Oxfords Triumph (STC 18589) describes James I's state visit to Oxford at the end of August, 1605. The king was entertained by learned debates on such subjects as "Whether the Saints and Angels doe know the thoughts of our hearts" and (more topically) "Whether in the time of Pestilence the pastors of the Church are tyed to visit the infected?" (Unfortunately we are not told the substance of the disputation, though this debate took "the space of two hours" [B3v-4]). The king's oration to the university is printed in Latin, then in English, and we learn that, on the final evening, "there was a Comedie plaied by saint Iohns men before his Maiestie," who was highly pleased with it (E1v). Similarly Newes of Sr. Walter Rauleigh , 1618 (STC 17148, two issues) and Three to One , 1626 (STC 19529, two editions), are relatively unadorned accounts. The first, based on letters sent " from a Gentleman of his Fleet ," describes the first part of Raleigh's ill-fated voyage. The second is Richard Peeke's lively account of his exploits in the Spanish war. (Reprinted in Stuart Tracts 1603-1693 .) On the other hand, A Bloody Tragedy, or Romish Maske , 1607 (STC 14526.5) and A Nunnes Prophesie, or the Fall of Friars , 1615 (STC 18747) trade upon anti-Catholic sentiment. The former is an especially lurid account of how five Jesuit priests in Germany held sixteen German "maides" in bondage and then ritually executed them once they had become pregnant. It is possible that Trundle himself put together, edited, or translated some of the copy that he published. The "editing" is apparent in those instances in which he changed the dates of old books. Thus the "I. T." of A Miracle of Miracles may refer to him (see above). His entry of "newes out of Germany" is said to be "translated out of the Dutch and French copie by. J. T∧" (Arber, 3:361). Another book, The Hunting of the Pox , 1619 (STC 23624.7) is ascribed to "I. T.," but the entry specifies that this is "J. T. of Westminster" (Arber, 3:642). However, "John T." wrote a dedication "to his best re-spected Friend, M r . Roger Taylor " for Keepe within Compass: or the Worthy Legacy of a Wise Father to His Beloued Sonne , 1619 (STC 14898.5 et seq. ). The dedication states that "it is my true knowledge of you, and my truer loue vnto you, which makes mee send this poore instant of my braine, and slender Collections to kisse your hand . . ." (A2-2v). This is a book of advice, counselling moderation in areas such as "Religion," "Apparell," and "Dyet." As far as available records show, it was Trundle's closest approach to a best-seller. Though most of the surviving copies are imperfect, it evidently went through several editions for Trundle. He assigned the title to John Wright in 1623 (Arber, 4:90), and Wright then published a "tenth impression". 29 Such a book was, however, a rarity for Trundle. Normally his titles demanded no more than one edition, or in some few instances a second edition following immediately upon the first. A publisher of ephemeral pamphlet literature, however, could not count on reprints to keep him afloat; instead he had to be enterprising and versatile in his pursuit of copy. Some authors such as Dekker and Taylor could be counted on to produce with fair consistency. Playwrights and acting companies were good sources, provided that the latter could be persuaded to part with their manuscripts. There were also the hack writers who could be employed to turn out verses on a current event, which could then be hurried onto the street as a ballad or broadside. All of the above, of course, had to be paid, which cut into the already slim profit margin that Trundle enjoyed; moreover they could not always be depended upon. A cheaper source was foreign pamphlets; these required only the services of a translator. Even more expedient, and cheaper, were old pamphlets that had already been published. These evidently did not even require license or entrance fees, and the publisher himself could do the minor editing to give them new currency. It is apparent that the profit motive and the pressure of competition fostered these and other sharp practices. Title-pages promised an astonishment that the text did not deliver. And in some instances, such as the Sussex dragon, it may be suspected that the publisher made a sensation out of a "non-event," a practice all too familiar in our own time. In the absence of a will or inventory, it is not easy to judge Trundle's success in the trade, but there are some indications that his success did not equal his notoriety. For one thing, his manner of working with associates meant that his profits, although they might be better assured, were less. His assignments of titles, increasing in frequency in the 1620's, suggest that he was in need of ready money (see Arber, 4:44, 58, 90, and 101). Finally, his widow's apparent failure in the trade may reflect not only her lack of business sense but also the condition of Trundle's estate at his death. WORKS CITED Arber, Edward.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A grant from the Faculty Research Committee of the University of Alabama in Birmingham helped to fund the research for this essay. I am also grateful to the staff at the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian Library, the Public Record Office, and the Cambridge University Library. To the following I am indebted for special help and courtesy: Miss Ann Pegrum and Mr. P. Walne at the County Record Office, Hertford; Miss Janet Foster, Archivist at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; Miss Eleanor Boulter at the Guildhall Library; Miss Aude Fitzsimons and Dr. Richard Luckett at the Pepysian Library, Magdalene College; and especially to Miss Robin Myers, Archivist at Stationers' Hall. 1 I am unable to offer a solution to the puzzling reference to a John Trundle in the letter from Sir Kenelm Digby to Viscount Conway in 1636 (see McKerrow, Dictionary ) other than to say that this, obviously, cannot have been the publisher who died in 1626 and that there is no evidence that the publisher had a son. In this letter, sent from Paris on the last of January, Digby describes his search for books for Conway's library: "I am promised La conqueste du sang real for you, and the Legend of S r . Tristram. . . ." He asks Conway to let him know what he wishes and also how much he is willing to spend, "for these are of the deerest bookes here." Later, near the end of the letter, he returns to the subject of books: "But that you may see by contributing of a mite to y r . treasury, what j would do if more j could; I haue searched John Trundle his shoppe of Paris, and haue found an Almanake and a Thesis of conclusions in the Sorbone, w ch . for the pictures sakes adorning them j make bold to send y. r Lo: Wherein you shall find our Regall Jupiter in his owne shape thundering, and our glorious Apollo casting influences both w. ch our almighty Cardinall Leuelleth and reflecteth. But if j giue any further scope to these droleries j shall not haue roome to sett downe that w ch . is my serious and necessary businesse w th . y. r Lo: that is, to professe myselfe as j haue vowed euer to be | y r . Lo: most humble and affectionate seruant. . . ." (I quote from the original in the Public Record Office, State Papers Domestic, 16/344 fol. 120-21; Plomer quoted part of the letter in 1904, p. 161; it is quoted in full in Bligh, pp. 197-198). The reference works that I have checked on the Paris book-trade do not mention a Trundle. It is just possible, noting the joking context in which the name is mentioned, that Digby means a certain kind of bookshop rather than any particular shop. Trundle's reputation as a dealer in "droleries" supports this possibility. 2 Arber 2:168. All references to Arber have been checked against the originals at Stationers' Hall and corrected whenever necessary. I cite Greg, BEPD , for all entrances of plays and their identifying numbers. I have silently changed all legal-year dates to the calendar year. 3 According to the records, Hancock was not very active in the book trade. He made only four entries in the Registers: for a "sadd Sonnet" on 24 February 1593 (Arber, 2:627); for a play "the owlde wifes tale" on 15 April 1595 ( BEPD , p. 12); for "an enterlude of Valentyne and Orsson" jointly with Thomas Gosson on 23 May 1595 ( BEPD , p. 12); and for a "gigg" on 26 May 1595 (Arber, 2:298). Apparently only The Old Wives Tale has survived. It was printed by John Danter for Hancock and John Hardie "to be solde at the shop ouer gainst Saint Giles his Church with-out Criplegate. 1595" ( BEPD , #137). This was evidently Hancock's address. The Parish Register of St. Giles, Cripplegate, records the christenings and burials of several of his children and servants during 1583-1592 as well as the burial of a servant of a "wyddowe Handecock, bokebynder" in 1603 (Miller, p. 27). 4 There is a very doubtful reference in The Tempest . Trinculo, referring to Ariel's play on tabor and pipe, says, "This is the tune of our Catch, plaid by the picture of No-body" (TLN 1483-4). But the pun on "Nobody" and "Somebody" was common at the time. 5 For the defective copies, see note 6, below. I have not been able to trace the following titles: (1) the report of a sea battle, entered 17 June 1605 (Arber, 3:293); (2) "Diuerse Lamentable fiers," entered 7 March 1607 (Arber, 3:343), though one of these may be included in Fire From Heaven ; (3) "Powles walkes or a gallant Dismasked," entered by Trundle and Richard Serger on 8 January 1608 (Arber, 3:367). A similar title had been printed by Creede to be sold by Matthew Lawe in 1604 (STC 17781); (4) an account of a murderer, "Morgan Colman," entered by Trundle and Joseph Hunt on 22 May 1609 (Arber, 3:410); (5) "The cold winter," entered conditionally on 12 March 1615 (Arber, 3:564). This may be The Cold Year , printed for Thomas Langley in 1615 (STC 26091); (6) "newes out of Lancashire," entered conditionally 12 September 1615 (Arber, 3:572); (7) "Guy of Warwick," entered 15 January 1620 and assigned to Langley on 13 December 1620 ( BEPD , pp. 31-2), first extant edition 1661 ( BEPD , #818); (8) "Judei oborantis Effigies," entered conditionally on 24 August 1620 (Arber, 4:40); (9) "The first &amp; 2. pte of Tom Thombe," assigned to Langley 13 December 1620 (Arber, 4:44); (10) "Liue within Compasse" is apparently STC 20583, published by John Wright in the 1630's. Trundle may have published earlier editions of this title. He assigned it along with "Keepe within Compasse" to Wright on 24 January 1623 (Arber, 4:90). This assignment refers to "two copies," and the fee was charged accordingly. However, the entrance to Trundle was for one title, "Keep or liue within Compas," with a single fee paid (Arber, 3:642); (11) "A Catechisme called A Briefe exicon of the Christian faith. by J. C." and "A Sermon called, The foode of the soule. by A.D.," assigned to John and Cuthbert Wright on 5 July 1623 (Arber, 4:101). The latter title was apparently printed by Miles Flesher in 1624 (STC 6161). Trundle probably published some lost editions of Deaths Knell . The ninth and tenth editions of this title were published by his widow (STC 19684 and .1), and the title was then assigned to the ballad partners (Arber, 4:213). The same may be true of the "2 d . part of D r Merryman," also included in this assignment (cp. STC 21366). 6 The following titles were printed for Trundle with his address in the imprint: (1) Nobody and Somebody , entered 12 March 1606 ( BEPD , p. 21, #229); (2) Two Faces under a Hood (STC 18495.5), cancel title-page, entered as The Bible Bearer , 22 April 1607 (Arber, 3:347); (3) Fire from Heaven (STC 13507), entered 14 August 1613 (Arber, 3:531); (4) Three Bloody Murders , 1613 (STC 18287), not entered; (5) Keep within Compass (STC 14898.5 et seq. , several defective issues or editions), entered 19 February 1619 (Arber, 3:642); (6) Westward for Smelts (STC 25292), entered 15 January 1620 (Arber, 3:663); A Rod for Runaways , 1625 (STC 6520, two editions), not entered; (7) Three to One (STC 19529), entered 18 July 1626 (Arber, 4:163). The following were printed for him but have no address in the imprint: (1) Greenes Tuquoque , 1614 ( BEPD , #323), not entered; (2) True and Wonderful (STC 20569, with the imprint reading: "Printed at London, by John Trundle"), entered 24 August 1614 (Arber, 3:553). Trundle entered The Life and Death of Gamaliel Ratsey on 2 May 1605 (Arber, 3:287), but the surviving copy lacks the title-page (STC 20753). 7 A curious entry occurs in the Register on 13 August 1608. William Welby entered "a booke called A marte for souldyours Coates procured by the Labour of John Trondell" (Arber, 3:388). Arber's italics make the "procured . . ." look like part of the title, but no such distinction, of course, is made in the original. I am not certain how to interpret this entry. Even if it means that the copy was procured by "Trondell," the publisher had no monopoly on the name. But the entry is certainly intriguing. 8 Two editions were printed for Trundle and Gosson and give no address; one edition, Room for Company , entered by Trundle on 22 October 1614 (Arber, 3:554), was "Imprinted at London for E. W." (STC 21315.4); and The Penitent Sonnes Teares , entered by Trundle and Richard Hodgkin or Hodgkinson on 16 September 1624 (Arber, 4:123), was printed for Trundle (STC 24435.5). 9 There is one other possible connection between Trundle and Butter. On 14 October 1614 Edward Allde, Trundle, and Thomas Snodham paid a fine of fifteen shillings "for printing a booke called the warres in Germany w th out license" (Jackson, p. 455). According to Jackson (p. 68, n. 1), this title refers to STC 11796, which was printed for Butter in that year. Jackson suggests that "Trundle evidently sold the book, and not Butter whose name it bears" (p. 68, n. 3). If this is the title in question, however, Trundle's habits suggest that he had something to do with the procurement of the copy, not the selling of it. 10 STC 14526.5. This shop may have belonged to Thomas Archer. In 1603 a newsbook was printed by Allde "for Thomas Archer and are to be solde at the little shop by the Exchange" (STC 18742). But this is apparently the sole instance in which Archer was associated with this exact address; his usual address was "Popes-head Pallace, neere the Royall-Exchange" (STC 18472, 6537, and 18455, all in 1607; STC 24080 in 1608). I have seen the "little shop at the Exchange" in one further imprint, a newsbook printed by Thomas Dawson in 1608 (STC 18258). RSTC says that Archer sold this edition. 11 Edgar was involved in fourteen publications during 1603-1608. He entered the titles of six of these alone and seven of them jointly (Trundle entered the remaining title). The editions, however, were sold at shops identified with other stationers. For example, Satans Sophistrie Answered was sold at "the signe of the Swanne in Pauls Churchyard," Cuthbert Burby's address (STC 19747.5 et seq ). The Arte of Prophecying , entered by Edgar and Burby (Arber, 3:334), was also sold at Burby's address (STC 19735.4). A Mad World My Masters , entered by Edgar and Walter Burre, was sold at Burre's shop "in Paules Churchyard, at the signe of the Crane. 1608" ( BEPD , p. 25, #276). And Hodgets sold three editions for Edgar: a newsbook (STC 1900, 1605); The Woman Hater ( BEPD , #245, 1607); and The Three English Brothers (STC 18592). From the evidence of imprints, it does not appear that Edgar actually owned a shop until 1609 when he set up in St. Paul's Churchyard at the Sign of the Windmill (STC 24395 and STC 7469). 12 Barnaby Rich mentions St. Pauls and the Exchange as the daily haunts of the "News-monger" ( My Ladies Looking Glasse , 1616, Giv [STC 20991.7]. Quoted in Herford and Simpson, 10:265.) It is possible that A Bloody Tragedy was issued with a variant or cancel-title-page giving Trundle's or another's address. RSTC locates only one extant copy of this edition. 13 BEPD , #235. Hodgets had moved to St. Paul's Churchyard by 1604. Earlier he was located in Fleet Street, near Fetter Lane end, at the sign of the Flower de Luce (imprints in STC 12294, 1601, and STC 18972, 1602). Most imprints between 1604-08 do not specify where his shop was located in the Churchyard. STC 1486, however, places him as "dwelling in Paules Churchyard a little be-neath Paules Schoole, 1605." Although most imprints after 1608 give no address, STC 24028 is "to be sould at the signe of the Kings Armes in Pauls Church-Yard . 1616." 14 Hodgets entered and published the following titles: (1) Ratseys Ghost (Arber, 3:291, STC 20753a); (2) a newsbook (Arber, 3:302, STC 13971); The Romish Spider (Arber, 3:313, STC 5704); and (4) The Dutch Courtezan ( BEPD , p. 20, #214). (This entrance was conditional, and the title was later assigned by Edgar to Hodgets. BEPD , p. 28.) In addition to the titles mentioned in the text, he sold for other stationers: (1) A news report from Bergen-op-zoom (STC 1900), entered by Eleazar Edgar 12 October 1605 (Arber, 3:303); (2) A Defense of Church Government (STC 7081), entered by Henry Rocket 11 November 1606 (Arber, 3:332); (3) The Woman Hater ( BEPD , #245), entered by Edgar and Robert Jackson 20 May 1607 ( BEPD , p. 23); and (4) A report of the travels of the Shirley brothers (STC 18592), entered by Edgar 8 June 1607 (Arber, 3:352). He apparently also sold several editions of The Honest Whore in 1604-1605 ( BEPD , #204), which had been entered to Thomas Man, Junior, in 1604 ( BEPD , p. 20). Some of these imprints read "for" Hodgets, others "sold by" him. Another title, Westward Ho , was entered by Rocket on 2 March 1605, but the entry was crossed out ( BEPD , p. 20). Hodgets sold an edition of this play in 1607 ( BEPD , #257), though he may have been acting for William Jaggard, the printer of the edition. He probably also sold two other editions for Jaggard. A Woman Killed with Kindness was not entered, but Jaggard printed the first edition "to be sold" by Hodgets in 1607, and the title was reprinted by Isaac Jaggard in 1617 ( BEPD , #258). Lady Pecunia was also not entered. John Jaggard had published the first edition in 1598, and in 1605, William Jaggard reprinted the title "to bee sold" by Hodgets (STC 1486). Hodgets evidently changed his manner of work in 1611. (There is no record of activity in 1609-1610.) During 1611-1624, he regularly entered copy which was then printed "for" him. And on 19 April 1613 he took over twenty-two copyrights which Edgar transferred in part or whole to him (Arber, 3:520-21). 15 In addition to the six editions noticed in the text, Marchant sold the following titles: (1) Londons Dove (STC 18588.5), entered by Joseph Hunt 12 May 1612 (Arber, 3:485). The imprint of one issue reads "for" Hunt, the other "for" Hunt, "sold by" Marchant. (2) Epithalamia (STC 25901), entered conditionally by William Welby 10 February 1613 (Arber, 3:515). (3) Epithalamium (STC 23722), not entered, two issues, one "for" Samuel Rand, the other "for" Rand, "sold by" Marchant. [These two books, as well as The Marriage Triumph , were all celebrations of the marriage of Prince Frederick and Princess Elizabeth. The fact that Marchant undertook to sell all three of these editions suggests that he, and apparently the publishers who employed him, was confident of his system of distribution.] (4) A Cast over the Water (STC 23741), not entered. The imprint reads "for" William Butler and gives his address but specifies that Marchant is the seller. (5) A newsbook (STC 18254). This imprint reads "for" Richard Lea and indicates both his shop and that of Marchant as the places of sale. (6) Theeues Falling Out (STC 12235), not entered, first published under a different title by Thomas Gubbin in 1592. The imprint here reads "for T. G. and are to be sould by R. [ sic ] Marchant at the Cross in Pauls Churchyard. 1615." 16 STC 24090. According to RSTC, the "widow" referred to in the imprint was Alice Gosson, Henry's mother. Henry Gosson used the Pannier Alley address several times during the years 1615-1622. In addition to the two instances noted in the text, this address occurs in the imprints of STC 24588, 1615; STC 23748.5, 1617; and STC 23742, 1622. Gosson also had a shop on London Bridge during these years: see imprints in STC 11403, 1608; STC 12724, [1610]; STC 5193, 1613; STC 19997, [1616]; STC 6993, 1617; STC 20746, 1619; STC 15120, [1620]; and STC 25088, [1620]. 17 According to imprints, during the years 1605-1631 John Wright sold seventeen editions the titles of which had been entered by other stationers. During 1615-1640 Edward Wright sold nine editions the titles of which had either been registered by another or the imprints of which indicate "for" another and/or "sold by" Wright. 18 The number of "anomalous" title-pages that occur in plays published or sold by Hodgets causes Greg to suspect that Hodgets was "being used either as a cat's-paw or as a stalking-horse" ( First Folio , p. 74, Note O). But variant imprints and cancel title-pages appear in editions other than plays and in instances in which there seems to be no reason for concealment (see, for example, STC 5704 and 5705, STC 7081 and 7082, STC 18592 and 18593). They may simply reflect some change in the business arrangement, or, on the other hand, they may be due to the manner of distribution. 19 In 1625 Trundle republished this broadside, with new statistics, under the title The Red-Crosse: or, Englands Lord Have Mercy upon Vs (STC 20823). The text with slight variation repeats that of the earlier plague bill, including the accounts of the history of the plague. There are several issues of this later edition. The copy at the Guildhall Library presents the deaths through 7 July; the two copies (printed on both sides of the same sheet) at the British Library give the statistics through 28 July (Lutton, III.69) and 4 August (Lutton, III.68). As well as the revised statistics, Lutton III.69 includes a preservative against the plague (strong tobacco) and a prescription for those infected (bayberries); Lutton III.68 omits the latter. (I have not seen the copy at the New York Public Library.) Gosson brought out still another edition in 1636 (STC 20824). 20 A more astute or imaginative bibliographer might be able to make more out of the coincidence of dates than I am able to. The two extant issues of the plague bill were printed in October 1603. Hamlet , Q1, can be dated as sometime after 19 May 1603 from the title-page statement: "As it hath beene diuerse times acted by his Highnesse seruants. . ." ( BEPD , #197). Thus the edition appeared sometime in the ten-month interval between this date and the new legal year in March. RSTC also identifies Roberts (with William Jaggard) as the printer of STC 22869, a newsbook that Trundle had entered in 1605. This edition was, however, printed for Butter. 21 It is possible that Dekker wrote The Cold Yeare , 1615, which may be "the cold winter" entered by Trundle conditionally in that year (Arber, 3:564). Trundle also entered "Guy of Warwicke" as by Dekker and John Day in 1620 ( BEPD , p. 31). 22 With regard to Trundle's access to play manuscripts, it is of interest to note that the defendants in the Markham suit were "chiefly Actors." These were, of course, Markham's subscribers, but the only publishers mentioned are Trundle and Henry Gosson. See Bentley, 2: "Players," passim . 23 Shaaber says that "this monster was too much even for the credulity of a credulous age and was laughed out of existence" (p. 154), perhaps alluding to Jonson's view that this was the kind of "Newes, that when a man sends them downe to the Shieres where they are said to be done, were never there to be found" (Herford and Simpson ed., 11. 49-51). Braitwait's reference occurs in Whimzies (STC 3591), B3 (quoted in Herford and Simpson, 10:600). The 1652 ballad is reproduced in Spufford (p. 95) and indicates that the story, or perhaps a shorter version in a ballad, had been reprinted. Unfortunately the ballad which tells "the manner of the killing of the serpent in Sussex," entered by Henry Gosson twelve days after Trundle's entry (Arber, 3:553), appears not to have survived. 24 The effect that was probably hoped for is described by Dekker in A Rod for Run-awayes where a "Farmers Sonne in Essex ," being read to from a Trundle broadside, "fell into a swound, and the Calfe had much a doe to be recouered" (C1v). 25 This account, published by John Thomas, gives the victim's name as " Margret Hooper of Edenbyres " in Durham (Wing M2889; see Herford and Simpson, 10:266). Evidently a good news item never went out of date. The "Printer" in Jonson's News from the New World admits that he indulges in this practice (ll. 65-67, Herford and Simpson ed. See the similar reference in The Staple of Newes , 1.5.59-61). 26 Compare the entry on 17 June 1605 in which Trundle brought to the Hall "The copy of A letter" concerning a sea fight near Dover. It is to be his copy "yf he gett sufficient Aucthoritie . . . And shewe his aucthority to the wardens Then yt is to be entred for his copy Or yf any other bringe the Aucthority. yet it is to be the said Jo. Trundelles copy." 27 Shaaber queries whether Trundle also published an edition of The Iust Downfall (STC 18920). The surviving copy of this edition lacks the imprint, but the "I. T." (John Taylor?) associated with it refers to the author of the funeral elegy first published by Gosson in 1615 (STC 2361.5) and added to this edition. Some of Trundle's titles do, however, appear in this collection, which was published, according to surviving copies, by Richard Higgenbotham. (See RSTC.) There is no record that Trundle assigned these titles to Higgenbotham, but there is a connection between the two in the assignment of another broadside on 26 February 1616 (Arber, 3:583). 28 Trundle's contribution to the enclosure controversy appears not to have survived. On 4 September 1607 he entered "A ballad of gods judgementes shewed vpon a couetous incloser of common pasture in Germany who was strangely troden to death by his owne Cattell" (Arber, 3:359). 29 RSTC omits one issue or edition of this book. The imprint of Bodleian Douce A385 (5) reads "Printed at London by G. E. for I. Trundle dwelling i&lt;n&gt; Barbican at the signe of No body [shaved]" and thus is distinct from either STC 14898.5 or 14899.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Dryden and the Fourth Earl of Lauderdale by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Dryden drew near the end of the Dedication to his translation of the Aeneid he listed the "Helps" he had had in "this Undertaking." His first acknowledgment was to the late Earl of Lauderdail [Richard Maitland, fourth Earl], [who] sent me over his new Translation of the Æneis ; which he had ended before I ingag'd in the same Design. Neither did I then intend it: But some Proposals being afterwards made me by my Bookseller, I desire'd his Lordship's leave, that I might accept them, which he freely granted; and I have his Letter yet to shew, for that permission. He resolv'd to have Printed his Work; which he might have done two Years before I cou'd Publish mine; and had perform'd it, if Death had not prevented him. But having his Manuscript in my hands, I consulted it as often as I doubted of my Author's sense. For no Man understood Virgil better than that Learned Noble Man. His Friends, I hear, have yet another, and more Correct Copy of that Translation by them: which had they pleas'd to have given the Publick, the Judges must have been convinc'd, that I have not flatter'd him. 1 This is the by far the most extended statement of debt in the Virgil on Dryden's part, and it has given rise to no little controversy as to the full measure of that debt. Lauderdale's translation was published posthumously in late 1708 or early 1709 with a second edition appearing some time between 1715 and 1718. 2 The editor of this second edition zealously marked lines and passages with double marks of quotation to point to Dryden's borrowings in toto for his Aeneid and with single marks of quotation to signal lesser depredations. What this anonymous editor did not know was that the Earl had made quite free with some early translations of parts of the Aeneid which Dryden had published in Sylvae (1685), i.e. the episodes of Nisus and Euryalus from Books V and IX, of Mezentius and Lausus from Book X, and of Venus and Vulcan in Book VIII. Students of Dryden's work have both defended and condemned him for his borrowings from Lauderdale; more recently attempts have been made to show that Lauderdale was the borrower, not Dryden. The question is more than an Alphonse-Gaston matter of precedence, for the borrowings are so very extensive that even the complacence in these matters of late-seventeenth-century and early-eighteenth-century men of letters would be disturbed. Professor Helene Maxwell Hooker stated, a number of years ago, that comparison of Dryden's and Lauderdale's translations of the Georgics "clearly establishes the fact that Lauderdale sent over not only his Aeneis [she had just quoted Dryden's Dedication on this]; he also sent over his Georgics . Among all the English versions represented in Dryden's Georgics , Lauderdale is first, leading [Thomas] May by a very slight margin." 3 Mrs. Hooker calculated Dryden's debt to be "a total of 241 rhyme words—Book I, 110; Book II, 25; Book III, 50; and Book IV, 56. Dryden uses 5 identical lines, all in Book I. In addition there are 42 questionable lines—2 in Book I; 7 in Book II; 10 in Book III; and 23 in Book IV. In company with Thomas May, Lauderdale served very much as a skeleton for the rhyme scheme of his friend's translation" (p. 296). L. Proudfoot, in his Dryden's "Aeneid" and Its Seventeenth Century Predecessors (1960), bluntly remarks that "there is simply no defence [for Dryden] against a charge of plagiarism from Lauderdale. It must have been in the consciousness of this that Dryden penned his Acknowledgment; but it remains inadequate. . . . Not all that can be written about the difference between literary morality in Dryden's day and our own can conceal the fact that Dryden tried to bluff." 4 Of the forty lines that Dryden took over "either verbatim or nearly so" in his translation of the fourth Book of the Aeneid Proudfoot assigns twenty-one to Lauderdale (pp. 265 and 266). Most recently, Professor Margaret P. Boddy has attempted to defend Dryden by suggesting that he had completed his translation of the Georgics and of the first eight Books of the Aeneid by May 26, 1695, one year earlier than the usually accepted date. By extension of a highly conjectural argument, Dryden is made out to have finished Georgics I-III and Aeneid I-IV in the first five months of 1694. Lauderdale, concludes Professor Boddy, " could have been [my italics] one of the friends to whom Dryden transmitted various parts of his translation as he finished them," and since it is known that Lauderdale saw the "arguments in prose" prefixed to each Georgic , Professor Boddy also concludes that he "certainly must have seen the text of the Georgics ." Even though it is known that Addison provided the arguments in prose, arguments which would not necessarily have been yet added to the text of Dryden's Georgics , Professor Boddy finds it "unlikely that the copying is the other way round," i.e. that Dryden copied from Lauderdale. 5 In a later article Professor Boddy shows that Lauderdale probably had a manuscript version of Dryden's translations of those parts of the Aeneid he published in Sylvae (1685) and goes on to state that "the revisions in both late manuscripts [of Lauderdale's Aeneid ] indicate that Lauderdale revised with a manuscript of Dryden's translation before him, being probably one of the gentlemen of taste to whom Dryden sent copies of his translation book by book as he finished them." At this point Professor Boddy footnotes a reference to her earlier article in support of her statement that "Lauderdale had seen a manuscript of Dryden's Georgics ." And then she makes what is surely another unwarranted assumption when she writes, "Moreover, while the possession of a manuscript of translations of Virgil by Dryden printed in the 1685 Sylvae need not mean that Lauderdale saw the later manuscripts, it certainly helps to establish a pattern." 6 In anticipation of later discussion it will be well to point out that Lauderdale was in France when he may be presumed to have "sent over" (the words are Dryden's) the translation Dryden saw. While there are seven known extant manuscripts and evidence of the existence of two others containing various parts of his translation, 7 there are none of Dryden's translation. Lauderdale, in France, with little hope of publishing his translation, could afford to send a manuscript over to England; after all he had more. Dryden, in England, permitted some of his friends to see his manuscript and transcriptions 8 made from it; whether he would take the chance of sending a manuscript to Lauderdale in France is another matter. What is obviously needed in the vexed question of who borrowed (plagiarized?) from whom is a chronology of events, in so far as one can be reconstructed now. The relevant dates are these: c. 1682 "The Lord Maitland . . . who began his excellent Translation of Virgil" is associated with Dryden in a literary academy begun by the Earl of Roscommon. 9 One should note that the translation is "of Virgil," not of the Aeneid alone. And that it is said to have begun as early as 1682. 1684 Dryden translates Virgil's fourth and ninth Eclogues for Miscellany Poems ; the other eight Eclogues were translated by a number of his friends and acquaintances, but Lauderdale is not among them, possibly because of political difficulties (see DNB ). 1685 Sylvae contains part of the fourth Georgic , translated by "an unknown Hand," which had been attributed to Thomas Creech until Professor Hooker pointed out that the passage, the Orpheus and Eurydice episode, appears as lines 491-637 of Lauderdale's translation (first edition). Professor Boddy believes the translation is Creech's and that Lauderdale simply took it over as he had passages from earlier translations of passages from the Aeneid by Dryden and John Stafford. 10 This collection also includes Dryden's translations of those parts of the Aeneid , listed above, from which Lauderdale borrowed extensively. 1689 Lauderdale translates Book VI of the Aeneid . 11 1689 or 90 Lauderdale follows James II to France. 12 1690 Lauderdale translates Books VIII and IV. 1691 Lauderdale translates Books XII, XI, and IX. 1692 Lauderdale translates Books X, II, III, and V and sells his collection of MSS. 13 This date is of importance in that Professor Boddy ( PQ , [1963], 269-270) asserts that Dryden's request for Lauderdale's "decorations," mentioned in a letter dated April 1695 by both Edmond Malone and Charles Ward, is for the 102 brass cuts (plates) used by John Ogilby in his Virgil and which she conjectures came into Lauderdale's hands. Tonson paid somebody £200 for these plates. What is more, Lauderdale sold his collection of drawings and engravings in 1690 (Boddy, PQ , [1963], 270). Since the Earl needed money all this time, what more natural than that he would have sold the 102 plates in this 1690 sale, if not in the 1692 sale of MSS? By April 1695, a date which Professor Boddy would put back a year, the Earl may have already died; he died in Paris in 1695, but no month or day date is known. 14 1693 Lauderdale translates Books I and VII. Dec. 12, 1693 Dryden writes, "I have undertaken to translate all Virgil: &amp; as an Essay, have already paraphrased, the third Georgique, as an Example; it will be published in Tonsons next Miscellanyes, in Hilary terme." 15 July, 1694 The Annual Miscellany for the Year 1694, Being the Fourth Part of Miscellany Poems contains Dryden's version of the third Georgic and Lauderdale's translation of the first Georgic . April, 1695 Dryden translates the fourth Book of the Aeneid . As he is translating the works in order, this means that the Eclogues and Georgics and the first three Books of the Aeneid are complete. 1695 Lauderdale dies in Paris; only the year date is known. In 1684 Dryden had translated the fourth and ninth Eclogues ; Lauderdale, whose translation of "Virgil" is said to have been begun by 1682, would have translated the Eclogues first, then the Georgics , and finally the Aeneid , as others had before (notably John Ogilby) and as others were to do later (notably John Dryden). Examination of the fourth Eclogue in the two versions shows that they coincide in the rhyme words for ten couplets, "coincide" including what I consider to be such parallels as "shows/foregoes" in the one as against "grow/forego" in the other. However, each or both could have got the rhyme words for seven of these ten couplets from any one of four predecessors. One remains with the rhyme words for three couplets and two possible slight verbal parallels—both have "cluster'd Grapes," and where Dryden has "nauseous Qualms" Lauderdale has "tedious Qualms." 16 Similarities in the ninth Eclogue are confined to rhyme words for four couplets and one verbal similarity—where Lauderdale has "dodder'd Beech" Dryden has "dodder'd Oak," a sufficiently unusual word, the first use of which the OED tentatively attributes to Dryden. There the word is defined as a "word conventionally used (?after Dryden) as an attribute of old oaks (rarely other trees); app. originally meaning: Having lost the top or branches, esp. through age and decay; hence, remaining as a decayed stump." Dryden uses the word in the Aeneid (II. 701-702) to describe an old laurel tree. One cannot believe that both Dryden and Lauderdale came independently upon the word—or coined it—for the same passage in Virgil. The amount and kind of Dryden's borrowings from his fellow translators in the 1684 translation of the Eclogues compared to Lauderdale's borrowings from the volume reveal quite clearly how much more Dryden depends on his predecessors than does Lauderdale. (I have tabulated these in a yet unpublished article.) For one thing, Dryden borrows more words, phrases, and lines than Lauderdale, who contents himself, with very rare exceptions, with rhyme words. Take, for example, the well-known Fortunatus senex passage in the first Eclogue , translated by John Caryll in the 1684 volume and running to fifteen lines in that translation. Lauderdale borrows rhyme words for two couplets—nothing more. Compare, however, Dryden's possible borrowings, indicated by my italics in his version: O Fortunate Old Man! whose Farm remains For you sufficient, and requites your pains , Tho' Rushes overspread the Neighb'ring Plains. Tho' here the Marshy Grounds approach your Fields, And there the Soyl a stony Harvest Yields. Your teeming Ewes shall no strange Meadows try , Nor fear a Rott from tainted Company . Behold yon bord'ring Fence of Sallow Trees Is fraught with Flow'rs , the Flow'rs are fraught with Bees : The buisie Bees with a soft murm'ring Strain Invite to gentle sleep the lab'ring Swain. While from the Neighb'ring Rock, with Rural Songs , The Pruner's Voice the pleasing Dream prolongs; Stock-Doves and Turtles tell their Am'rous pain, And from the lofty Elms of Love complain. This is typical of Dryden's practice throughout the Eclogues . What is more, his reliance on remoter predecessors in the translation of the Eclogues is consistently greater than Lauderdale's. (My unpublished tabulation). All of which is to suggest that given a body of translation—of the Eclogues —available to Dryden and to Lauderdale, the former helped himself much more plentifully than the latter, despite (or was it because of?) his association in one of these translations, the joint effort of the 1684 volume. Thus, when one is confronted with the many parallels in Dryden's and Lauderdale's versions of the Eclogues , the natural supposition is that the borrower was Dryden, since he at least saw Lauderdale's manuscript translation of the Aeneid , while there is absolutely no evidence that Lauderdale ever saw any part of Dryden's final manuscript. The extent of the debt, discounting rhymes, lines, and words and phrases available to Dryden from the other predecessors, is the rhyme words for forty-five couplets, six nearly identical lines, and nineteen words or phrases. Possibly this may seem too little to matter, but when it is added to Dryden's considerable debt to his other predecessors, and he borrowed from every one of them, the total may give rise to questions of literary morality and, more importantly, of Dryden's artistry. It may be recalled that the editor of the second edition of Lauderdale's Virgil used double and single marks of quotation to point out Dryden's indebtedness to this version. And it should also be remembered that L. Proudfoot (1960) analyzed Book IV of the Aeneid to show to what extent Dryden used his predecessors' versions. Despite, or possibly because of, these two attempts to gauge the exact degree of indebtedness, I have myself analyzed the translations of Book IV of the Aeneid by Dryden and by Lauderdale in the attempt to show that the debt is greater than has hitherto been realized. The editor of the second edition of Lauderdale's Virgil was not interested in rhyme words particularly, and Proudfoot was not sufficiently rigorous in the matter of half-rhymes or verbal similarities. First of all, it must be said that Dryden obviously had had access to the manuscript which provided the text for the second edition of Lauderdale's translation, for in twenty-two of twenty-five lines where Lauderdale revised the first edition Dryden is indebted to or follows (or coincides with, although the number is too great for coincidence) the second edition. For example, line 783 in Dryden's version of Book IV reads, "Then shall I seek alone the Churlish Crew"; Lauderdale's first edition reads, "Shall I alone go with some jocund Crew" (l. 597); whereas his second edition reads, "Shall I alone go with the churlish Crew" (l. 628). 17 Proudfoot, it should be observed, does not comment on this similarity. The three places where Dryden seems to favor the first edition are at his lines 399, 864, and 968 where he has " Ascanius ," "the," and "calling," closer to the first edition's " Ascanius ," "the," and "call'd" as opposed to the second edition's "Son Iulus '," "his" and "invok'd." But these may be coincidences, the first being of very little consequence indeed and all being cancelled by the significant similarities between Dryden and Lauderdale's second edition. As one more example, compare the last lines of the fourth book in each version. Lauderdale 1 has, By Heaven's Command I bring. This Present sacred to th' infernal King: I free from Flesh, then cut her yellow Hair, Heat slipt away, her Life dissolv'd in Air. Lauderdale 2 reads, I set thee free from Flesh, devote thee to the Dead: This Off'ring to the infernal King I bear: She said, and strait she cut the yellow Hair; Heat slip'd away, her Life dissolv'd in Air. And Dryden has, And said, I thus devote thee to the dead. This Off'ring to th' Infernal Gods I bear: Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal Hair; The strugling sould was loos'd, and Life dissolv'd in Air. Unless one wishes to believe that the unknown editor of Lauderdale 2 plagiarized from Dryden's version in order to make Dryden's debt to Lauderdale seem greater, the only tenable conclusion is that Dryden helped himself from Lauderdale 2. 18 In the following table I list only the similarities not noted by Proudfoot. Dryden is not quoted when his version is identical to lauderdale 2.

Earlier, Proudfoot had written that Lauderdale's version of Virgil "is not only readable itself, but . . . it was read by the greatest poet of his day and used by him as a standard and store of material for his own attempt" (p. 179). The editor of L2 marks twelve lines with double quotes and 46 with single quotes. 35 Dryden could, then, have got the rhyme-words for one hundred and twenty-two of his couplets from L2, as well as forty-eight phrases (i.e. two or more words together) and forty-five words. This is an impressive total, and when one counts the actual number of lines in which these various borrowings or coincidences or parallels occur, they total 315 of the 1009 lines of Dryden's version of the fourth Book. If one adds to this the number of couplets (69) for which Dryden could have gone to one of his seventeenth-century predecessors other than Lauderdale, according to Proudfoot's analysis , the total number of couplets becomes 191 and the total number of lines becomes 454. Proudfoot is not concerned, it is well to repeat, to explore Dryden's possible indebtedness to his predecessors for single words, except in very rare instances. Nor have I done so either, except for L2, but I have checked the predecessors independently and have discovered that Proudfoot sometimes overlooks additional possibilities of indebtedness on Dryden's part. That Dryden, already up to his neck in debt for rhyme-words, might have derived those for one more couplet from the 1654 Ogilby translation, i.e., suspect/erect (ll. 137-138) from Ogilby's reflect/erect (p. 265) is of almost no interest whatsoever. That Proudfoot should have overlooked the following is another matter entirely. Dryden's version is first, then Sidney Godolphin's part of The Passion of Dido for Aeneas (1658): Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno , lead This wand'ring Navy to your needful Aid (62-63) Propitious Heaven it seems, and Juno ledd These Trojans heere, with soe desir'd an aid (51-52) Impatiently he views the feeble Prey, Wishing some Nobler Beast to cross his way (227-228) Meantime, the gath'ring Clouds obscure the Skies (231) he wishes some incensed Bore his praye or Lyon from the hill would crosse his waye Meanwhile the gathering cloudes obscure the Pole (167-169) (At ll. 235-236 Dryden has to Coverts ride/side and at 171-172 Godolphin has divide/to coverts Ride). Base and ungrateful, cou'd you hope to fly, And undiscover'd scape a Lover's Eye! Nor cou'd my Kindness your Compassion move, Nor plighted Vows, nor dearer bands of Love! (441-444) Could thy dissembling hart consent to flye this hated Land, with cruell secresye Perfidious man, canst thou soe soone remove the Bondes of vows, and dearer bondes of Love? (307-310) Look, Anna , look; the Trojans crowd to Sea, They spread their Canvass, and their Anchors weigh. (601-602) Anna she sayes, thou seest the peopled seas the Phrigeans now their fatall Anchors waye (435-436) 36 Proudfoot fails to note Dryden's almost verbatim borrowing of a couplet from Edmund Waller's part of The Passion of Dido for Aeneas (1658). Dryden has "Witness, ye Gods, and those my better part,/How loth I am to try this impious Art" (710-711); Waller has, "Witness, ye Gods! and thou my dearest part!/How loath I am to tempt this guilty art" (51-52). Compare also the rhyme words; Dryden's version is first: Dome/Tomb (667-668), tomb/come (27-28); above/Love (694-695), prove/love (41-42); Vest/Guest (714-715), guest/dressed (55-56). Proudfoot quotes a couplet from John Vicars's translation (1632) as a possible source for Dryden's lines 188-189 and remarks, "I am not fully satisfied, from the evidence of Book VI, and from such further comparisons as I have been able to make, that Dryden consulted Vicars at all, but I think it likely" (p. 33). He remarks similarities in rhyme words in four more couplets, and that is all. There are, however, thirteen more of Dryden's couplets which may owe their rhyme words to Vicars's version. 37 What is more, although I have not thought it necessary to carry my analysis to verbal similarities, there are some between the two versions. According to Proudfoot, Dryden's "debts" to Robert Stapylton's translation of Book IV (1632) "are small" (p. 125). However small the debts may be, they should be increased to the slight possible extent of the rhyme words for five couplets. 38 Proudfoot has very little to say about Sir Robert Howard's version of the fourth book, published in his Poems (1660). He suggests that Howard "appears to have been consulted by Dryden" (p. 156) and finds that Dryden is indebted to him for one line (p. 266), hardly a significant number. But he says nothing about the rhyme-words for twenty couplets (actually sixteen couplets and four triplets) in which Dryden coincides with Howard. 39 To recapitulate, then. Dryden could have got the rhyme-words for 122 of his couplets from Lauderdale's second edition, as well as 48 phrases and 45 words, so that the total number of lines affected would be 315. Proudfoot's analysis adds another 69 couplets, which brings the total number of couplets to 191 and the number of lines to 454. Add to this the rhyme-words for 48 more couplets (actually 43 couplets and 5 triplets) and the number of lines swells to 555, well over half the 1009 lines in Dryden's version. And this is without any attempt to trace indebtedness as to word or phrase in any predecessor other than Lauderdale. Proudfoot should have a penultimate word. "But for Heaven's sake," he exclaims, "do not let us conclude that he [Dryden] was saving time or work. The perpetual consultation and weighing of texts described by Bottkol and documented by Miss Hooker and myself is unimaginably toilsome and slow." He thereupon undertakes to translate a familiar text faster and with less labor than anybody following Dryden's method. And he concludes "that Dryden's procedure is intelligible only if we presume that he was seeking a definitive version, constantly embodying in his own work what he thought had been well done, and constantly measuring himself against the best version he could find of any given version" (p. 267). Almost surely so, but with some qualification: Dryden had available to him a composite framework of line beginnings, rhyme-words by the hundreds, and a number of words and phrases upon which to build his own version. Only by analysis such as has been attempted here can the extent of that framework be known and the ensuing comparison of that framework with the completed edifice be made.</field>

Ward, p. 64; the legal agreement with Tonson is dated June 15, 1694. 16 It must be understood here and throughout that the verbal parallels do not appear in any of their predecessors unless otherwise indicated. 17 The discrepancy in line numbers between the two editions results from a misnumbering of lines in the first edition after l. 255 (pp. 158-159). 18 For the rest of the evidence for Dryden's dependence on Lauderdale 2 compare the following, the sequence being Lauderdale 1, 2, and Dryden: And think (39) Think you (39) Think you (46); But must not (45) But will you (45) But will you (53); and (80) Where (80) Where (92); fallen Stars (96) falling Stars (96) falling Stars (116); to (128) with (128) with (153); shall (142) will (142) will (170); Messilian (158) Massylian (158) Massylian (187); Leafes (176) Wreaths (176) Wreaths (212); pray'd for (236) promis'd (266) promis'd (335); Now Atlas lofty Top sees as he flies (260) Now sees the top of Atlas as he flies (290) Now sees the Tops of Atlas as he flies (362); flee, and leave (297) Fly, and loaths (327) fly, and loaths (407); pitying Anna (471) pious Anna (501) pious Anna (632); Anna (605) Sister (635) Sister (791); hale (649) haul (679) haul (851); his Houshold (656) his Gods (686) his Gods (859); could (658) should (688) should (861); sees (666) see'st (696) view'st (872); Revenging (669) Avenging (699) avenge (877); I (704) I'll (734) I will (915); Since neither (766) For since (796) For since (997). 19 Both versions have triplets here. 20 In a line distinguished by single quotes. 21 Proudfoot quotes only Ogilby, whose rhyme words are Light/Night. 22 Proudfoot quotes only the second line of each couplet. 23 Proudfoot quotes only the first line of each couplet. 24 Proudfoot quotes only the second line of Lauderdale's couplet, ignoring the other rhyme word. 25 Proudfoot quotes only Ogilby, whose rhyme words are also flyes/Skyes. 26 The second line of Dryden's couplet is marked by double quotes, signifying a direct borrowing from L2. 27 Proudfoot gives no source in any of Dryden's predecessors for this and the next quoted couplets, i.e., L2 (365-366) and Dryden (455-456). 28 The editor of L2 marks Dryden's l. 463 with single quotes and l. 464 with double quotes, thus making quite a cluster from ll. 455-456 to 463-464. 29 Proudfoot quotes a line from Denham and one from Ogilby and remarks, mistakenly, "It will be seen that after the versions of Denham and Ogilby have been combined, 'seek' remains Dryden's." 30 Proudfoot describes "justling" as "expressive and informal" (p. 73), not indicating that it was Lauderdale's word. 31 Waller, quoted by Proudfoot, has rend/bend, but there are more similarities to L2 close at hand. 32 Lines 597-599 in L2 are marked by single quotes. 33 Lines 839-840, 841-842, and 845-846 in Dryden derive from L2 (Proudfoot, pp. 83-84). 34 Proudfoot quotes Denham only, missing the verbal similarity in "gave." 35 I would add five more lines to the latter category: 58, 360-361, 468, and 628. The equivalent lines in Dryden are 66, 449-450, 591, and 784. 36 Compare also these rhyme words; Dryden's version is first: loves/roves (93-94), love/move (75-76); Mind/find (411-412), minde/inclin'd (285-286); report/Resort/Court (431-433), report/resort (301-302); steer/there (499-500), care/there (355-356); part/Heart (612-613), Art/heart (443-444). Close to the first couplet in each version are two significant verbal parallels: Dryden has "careless Hind" (l. 96) and "ranckles in her Heart" (l. 100); Godolphin has "careless Hind" (l. 78) and "ranckells in her breast" (l. 80). 37 neglect/reject (50-51), neglect/reject (p. 88); relate/Fate (109-110), related/waited (p. 90); prepare/there (176-177), there/bear (p. 92); Gate/wait (184-185), gates/plates (p. 92); State/Rate (308-309), late/rate (pp. 95-96); delight/sight (474-475), flight/might (p. 100); Mind/find (529-530), kinde/minde (p. 102); Mind/find (564-565), windes/mindes (p. 103); bind/Wind (603-604), winde/refin'd (p. 104); rear/Air (727-728), aire/faire (p. 108); Light/Night (743-744), Moon-light/might (p. 108); void/descry'd (843-844), spi'de/slide (p. 111). 38 attend/bend (229-230), descend/contend (B6 r ); Skies/flies (231-232), fly/Lye (B6 r ); o're/forbore (520-521), before/ore (C4 v ); Care/Air (712-713), prepare/ayre (C8 v ); Mind/find (774-775), winde/minde (D2 r ). 39 stand/Band (123-124), stand/unman'd (p. 145); inclose/Brows (212-213, goes/inclose (p. 147); Skies/flies (231-232), skie/flie (p. 148); brings/wings (253-254), wings/flings (p. 148); crown'd/ground (292-293), ground/crown'd (p. 149); led/Bed (312-313), bed/fled (p. 150); Shame/Fame (324-325), flame/Fame (p. 150); Days/Ease (330-331), stays/delays (p. 150); plies/flies (376-377), flies/lies (p. 152); here/rear (390-391), ear/here (p. 152); say/obey (423-424), they/obey (p. 153); Flight/delight/sight (473-474), might/flight (p. 154); Pride/ride (574-575), side/ride (p. 157); clears/appears (692-693), appear/clear (p. 160); find/design'd/Mind (722-724), find/mind (p. 161); reliev'd/receiv'd (779-780), leave/receive (p. 162); Shore/bore (859-860), before/bore (p. 164); behind/design'd (929-930), design'd/find (p. 166); embrac'd/cast/last (933-935), cast/last (p. 166); Light/sight/Night (990-992), light/sight (p. 168).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Gleanings from the Scots Magazine (1739-1800) by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very little has been written about the Scots Magazine (hereafter SM ), begun in January 1739 and with a name change in the early years of the next century. 1 The truth of the matter is that for most of the eighteenth century the monthly numbers of the periodical, except for domestic affairs and much of the poetry, were nothing more than a reprinting of all manner of articles, letters, reviews and what-have-you from English periodicals, mainly from the Gentleman's Magazine (hereafter GM ). Sometimes the source was identified; more often, not. Hence, one might read an interesting bit of literary criticism in the book review section of the SM without realizing that it was taken, usually verbatim, from the GM . Many monthly numbers were also eked out by the reprinting of current periodical essays: The Rambler , The Idler , The Adventurer , The Inspector , The World —and others. Hence, the suspicion that something in the SM in its first sixty-two years appeared there for the first time and was otherwise unknown must always be a suspicion, something particularly true when the author of the piece in question was not a Scot. Despite this, the SM is worth studying, both for itself and as an example, in some areas, of what may be found in other eighteen-century periodicals. The National Union Catalogue lists twenty-three locations, and the entire run, ninety-seven volumes, is available on film from University Microfilms of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The editors of the Yale edition of Dr. Johnson's Rambler were able to cite an unpublished dissertation which recorded reprintings of the Rambler in various contemporary periodicals, including fifty in the SM , seventeen more than in the GM , incidentally. No similar study exists for the distribution of the Adventurer essays, that joint effort of John Hawkesworth, Johnson, Joseph Warton, and a fourth party responsible for but seven out of a total of one hundred and forty. It is of no little interest that the SM reprints thirty-five Adventurer essays in their entirety, with Number 16 in the Preface to the volume for 1752, there praised for "the promoting of religion and virtue." Roy M. Wiles has pointed out that the SM reprinted Rambler No. 14 in the Preface of the 1750 volume, praising it as "that periodical masterpiece of learning and genius." 2 In addition, the SM gives the translations of all the mottoes for the reprinted essays. What I find interesting, and possibly informative, is that only five essays are by Johnson, five by Warton, one by the fourth man and the rest, twenty-four in number, by Hawkesworth. Johnson's essays are Numbers 81, 95, 115, 137, and 138, on plagiarism, the story of the Admirable Crichton, on the age of authors, on "Writers not a Useless Question," and on "Their Happiness and Felicity." Did the editors of the Scots Magazine who had reprinted fifty of Johnson's Ramblers know that the essays signed "T" were by Johnson? And if so, did they, for whatever reason, deliberately favor Hawkesworth so heavily over him? The odds are that they did not know the identity of "T," and what one is left with is some probable evidence of taste, i.e., that the SM editors believed their readers would prefer Hawkesworth's tales and moral essays to Warton's critical papers and Johnson's varied efforts. 3 Should a similar examination of the appearance of the Adventurer in other periodicals be undertaken, one might have a more reliable index to the popularity of certain of the essays. Since the GM was at hand, I checked it. The first four Adventurers are briefly summarized therein and eighteen essays are reprinted, with thirteen by Hawkesworth, three by Johnson, one by the fourth man, and Number 90 contributed by George Colman. Duplication exists in Number 23, "Scheme of a new Memorandum-Book for the Use of the Ladies, with a Specimen," by the fourth man; in Johnson's account of the Admirable Crichton (Number 81); and in Numbers 30, 52, 61, 100 and 140, by Hawkesworth. Johnson's other two are Number 69, "Idle Hope," and Number 108, "The Uncertainty of Human Things." [The others by Hawkesworth are 5, 10, 38, 46, 114, 121, 132, 140. I have taken titles from those given in Alexander Chalmers, The British Essayists . . ., vols. 19-21 (1866).] Warton and Johnson joined Hawkesworth rather late in the game, with Johnson's first essay being Number 34 and Warton's Number 49, the admittedly scanty evidence of reprintings in the SM and the GM showing that only five of Warton's twenty-three critical essays were thought worth reprinting in the SM and none in the GM , while Johnson did not fare too much better. Mary E. Knapp's David Garrick . A Checklist of His Verse , Robert Brittain's "Christopher Smart in the Magazines," and Norma Russell's Bibliography of William Cowper to 1837 4 all overlook items that appeared in the SM. Miss Knapp does not record the appearance in the SM for August 1790 (p. 402) of Garrick's "Occasional Prologue Written and Spoken by Mr. Garrick, on Reading his Farce of Lethe to their Majesties, After he had Quitted the Stage, 1777," a first printing of the poem, as it precedes by one month its appearance in the European Magazine in September 1790, recorded by Miss Knapp. One "poem" attributed to Garrick in the SM is not mentioned in the Checklist and will be discussed below. Robert Brittain's listing of Smart's poems in the periodicals does not include the following: Chaucer's Recantation , a specimen of the Seatonian Prize poem On the Power of the Supreme Being , The Brocaded Gown and Linen Rag , The Widow's Resolution , The Duellists , the epigrams On Squab and On Snaggle (both attributed to Smart by Brittain), Fashion and Night , The Snake, the Goose, and Nightingale , Mrs. Abigail and the Dumb Waiter , To Health , and Stanzas on the Distressed Portuguese (these last two from The Universal Visiter ). 5 Five of the reprinted poems are fables, possible evidence of the popularity of that genre in general or Smart's fables in particular. Four of Cowper's poems and an extract from The Task entitled "The Bastille" appeared in the SM in 1789, and one poem, The Negro's Complaint in 1792 (p. 32). The four poems in 1789 are On Mrs. Throckmorton's Bulfinch in April (p. 196), The Morning Dream in May (p. 246), On the Queen's Visit to London , 6 and The Lily and the Rose in July (p. 342); the extract from The Task appeared in September (p. 444). What is interesting about the appearance of the poem on the bullfinch is that in the GM for February 1789 (pp. 162-163) it is not signed or attributed, whereas in the European Magazine (hereafter EM ) printing it follows the Song , "The poplars are fell'd," termed "By Mr. Cowper," while it, the bullfinch poem, is "By the Same." The SM , like the GM , but unlike the EM , has the Latin epigraph "Lugete Veneres Cupidinesque," 7 and makes the fullest attribution, i.e. "By Mr. Cowper." Both GM and SM have the accepted full title of the poem; the EM has merely On the Death of a Lady's Bullfinch . The text of The Morning Dream in the SM is identical to that in the EM , both in May 1789, differing with the November 1788 GM text in thirteen places. The text of The Lily and the Rose appeared in the June 1789 EM ; that in the SM is identical, following the EM by one month. The poem on the Queen's visit is identical in the EM and SM , both appearing in July. [ SB , 34 (1981), 233-240.] The SM text of The Negro's Complaint is a curious one, and in what follows I give its readings first, then that of the GM , and last that of the Oxford edition. Note that Norma Russell records the December 1793 GM appearance of the poem (p. 136) but not the prior appearance in the January 1782 SM . Indeed, the earliest periodical appearance of the poem recorded in her bibliography is that in The Arminian Magazine for January 1783 (p. 134). The variants, other than those of spelling and punctuation are: Sitting/Lolling/Lolling (l. 22); Blacks/backs/backs (l. 23); sweets/sweet/sweets (l. 24); Fetters/Fetters/Matches (l. 30); that/which/which (l. 31); for/of/of (l. 32); Is/Are/Are (l. 36); should/would/would (l. 38); these/their/their (l. 39); whirlwinds/whirlwind/whirlwinds (l. 40); sorrows that we/miseries which we/miseries we have (l. 43); bought/brought/brought (45); smart/mart/mart (l. 46); nation/nations/nation (l. 49). SM and Oxford agree in three readings, ll. 24, 40, and 49. SM and GM agree on the "Fetters" of l. 30, noted as a 1793 edition reading " and quoted by T. Wright from a MS ." (Oxford edition, p. 372). How, one may ask, could the January 1782 SM give the "Fetters" reading a year before the 1793 edition unless, possibly, it had had access to the MS quoted by Thomas Wright? If the GM took the "Fetters" reading from the SM , why did it not follow the SM text in a number of other readings? And if the SM did have access to the MS, what is one to make of the other variants from the received text, many of which variants can be proved to be inferior or actual errors? What remains are two unique readings that need explanation, the "sitting" of l. 22 and the "sorrows that we" of l. 43. Are these also MS readings, and if so, why were they not quoted by Wright? In any event, the textual apparatus of the Oxford version of this poem needs some revision. Since many books, periodicals, single poems, essays, reviews and miscellaneous information conveyed by the printed word exist in small numbers or are inaccessible except at considerable expenditure of time and money, their appearance in reprinted form in some more readily available work is especially welcome. For example, all libraries are not fortunate enough to contain full or lengthy runs of the Monthly Review and the Critical Review , two of the most important eighteenth-century periodicals for the reviewing of literature. One of the most important, or at least well-known and long-expected, publications of 1765 was Samuel Johnson's edition of Shakespeare's plays with its justly famous Preface. Now, the Preface came in for much critical attention in the Monthly and in the Critical , and if one did not have access to the issues for 1765, he might get some of this criticism in books on Johnson. However, access to the SM for 1765 would not only give the Preface in full but also, in footnotes marked "M" or "C," the quoted comments of the reviewers of the two periodicals in question. Another example. While the pamphlet The Chronicle of the Kings of England . Written in the manner of the ancient Jewish historians . By Nathan Ben Saddi, a priest of the Jews , published in 1740 and usually ascribed to Lord Chesterfield, is not a terribly rare book as it went through a number of editions, those with access to the SM would find the entire text of the pamphlet reprinted in the Appendix to Volume X for the year 1748. What is more, a number of periodical essays not always immediately at hand were impressed into service, so that readers of the SM will find essays from Sir John Hill's Inspector , Christopher Smart's Student and his Universal Visiter , as well as from the Universal Spectator , the British Magazine and others. 8 Another way in which periodicals may be of help, and the SM was of such help, is in fixing the date of the first publication of a work. Thus, the catalogue of new books in the SM for October 1773 announced the publication of the late Tobias Smollett's Ode to Independence , noting that a few copies of the poem "were thrown off at Glasgow." Since certain "Observations" that accompany the published poem are dated "Glasgow, February 23d, 1773," the first publication of the poem had to fall between that date and October 1773, the SM giving the necessary terminus ad quem . 9 On occasion, rarely in the SM but in at least one instance, attribution of authorship, mistaken or correct, of a particular piece is first made in the periodical in which it is first printed. A Song, "Say Phoebe, why is gentle Love," first appeared in the SM for October 1769 and was there attributed to Alexander Pope. Gilbert Wakefield accepted the poem as Pope's but it has not been reprinted in later editions. 10 I made mention above of a "poem" by Garrick which is not in Miss Knapp's Checklist of his verse, probably because it is not a poem by eighteenth-century standards. It is entitled "Inscriptions on the DEITY. By David Garrick, Esq;" which, with its headnote, I quote in its entirety, as it appeared in the 1779 poetry section: Many inquiries having been made respecting the religion of Mr. Garrick, the following will be some step towards an investigation of that matter. It contains his sentiments of the Deity, and of a future state, and it is assumed was written and sent by him many years ago to a friend, now highly dignified in the church, and with whom he had had frequent conversations on the subject. Lord of the Universe! Who from Chaos called forth Light, Life, and Beauty; Matter, and Space infinite. Orb above Orb, Beyond the reach of vision Floating in liquid æther— (Self-pendent), And each Orb a WORLD. The blest abodes of each departing soul Whose efforts here were imitating thee Thy FIAT, Passing without exertion, Bids thunders roll, and earthquakes do thy work. The Sun, Bursts from the ocean, And in serene sublimity ascending, Gladdens the face of Nature: The kind Mother, Submissive to Creation's arduous work, Promulgates thy existence. A leaf, a flower proves it. Is there a wretch who doubts? ANATOMY, Rekindling into life, Starts at the infidel: Discordant elements, Hush'd into silence by the mighty theme, Confess their GOD. There is no discussion of Garrick's religious views in the recently published definitive biography. 11 While one cannot be sure of this attribution, and while its very presence in the highly derivative SM arouses the suspicion that it had probably appeared elsewhere earlier, it should be known if only to be proved uncanonical. So, too, with an anecdote in the 1797 SM (pp. 722-723), the gist of which is that a beautiful young lady saw Garrick in the part of Romeo, became enamoured of him, wrote for a tête-à-tête, saw him as Scrub in The Beaux Stratagem , and then wrote again "forbidding him ever to be seen in her presence, for that she would have no connection with one, who, like Proteus, could appear in so many different shapes, and all to the life." This may be apocryphal, but then much anecdotal literature is. As one finds, or thinks he finds, "new" pieces, his suspicion grows that he may be overlooking some obvious possibilities—after canvassing the usual places. Besides the poems already discussed there are unnoticed poems, and now I proceed alphabetically, by James Granger, John Hawkesworth, Thomas Lyttelton, George Lyttelton, William Pitt, Charlotte Smith, William Somerville, and a Mr. Waller (not Edmund), author of a poem on Addison. Most of these deserve little more than mention of their titles and quotation of their first lines, although with some a word or two of explanation will be in order. "Verses to the Author of the Man of Feeling, Found in a blank leaf of the book which belonged to the late Mr. Granger, author of the Biographical History of England" appeared in 1785 (p. 46). Beginning "Whilst other writers, with pernicious art, / Corrupt the morale, and seduce the heart," the poem hymns the virtues of Henry Mackenzie's novel. Granger lived in relative obscurity and is remembered almost exclusively for his Biographical History . I found no connection between Mackenzie (1745-1831), whose novel was published in 1771, and Granger (1723-1776), nor need there have been, of course. Two poems by John Hawkesworth must be thought of as companion pieces, both printed in the 1774 SM on the same page (430). "On Freedom" begins, "Freedom's charms alike engage"; "On Friendship," "Friendship is the joy of reason." The latter poem appeared ten years later in the Westminster Magazine (1784, p. 383). 12 Two Lord Lytteltons, father and son, George and Thomas, are represented by a poem each, the father's being short enough to quote in its entirety. It is, like so many others in the century, an occasional poem, "By Lord Lyttelton, after reading Junius's last letter addressed to Lord Mansfield": In vain an host of foes their weapons wield, Safe is the breast which Truth and Virtue shield; With those, my Lord, to guard and protect you Each dart proves " telum imbelle, sine ictu " (1772, p. 94). The Latin is from the second book of the Aeneid , part of the confrontation of Priam and Pyrrhus, the former of whom hurled his "weak and harmless spear" (Loeb) at his executioner. Junius's last letter to Lord Chief Justice William Mansfield, the fifty-eighth of the Junius letters, is dated 21 January 1772. Lyttelton's poem is marked "Hillstreet, Feb. 2." In his letter Junius accuses Mansfield of violating the law by allowing bail to "a felon, under the circumstances, of being taken in the fact, with the stolen goods upon him , and making no defence ," 13 Thomas, Lord Lyttelton, the so-called "bad Lord Lyttelton," sowed a not inconsiderable crop of wild oats in Italy, thought fertile ground for such activity in the eighteenth century. He married in June 1772, but about two years later he deserted his wife and carried off a barmaid to Paris ( DNB ). A volume of his verse was published in 1780, a year after his death. The poem in the 1792 SM (p. 340) is unsurprisingly titled "Ode to Miss Butts, the Maid of the Pump-room at Bath" and begins "Tho' royal Bladud's healing spring / To palsied age relief can bring." The poet implores Miss Butts to grasp the day, to give up toiling for gold, and to take her joys within Strephon's arms. William Somervile, best remembered for his poems The Chace and Hobbinal, or Rural Games , collected his Occasional Poems . . . in 1727, with pride of place accorded "An Ode, humbly inscrib'd to his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, Upon his Removal from all his Places." But a similarly titled poem in the 1742 SM (p. 116), "To his Grace the Duke of Argyle [John Campbell, second Duke of Argyle], upon his being restored to his places" has, I believe, gone unnoticed. It begins "Intrepid in the field, in senates wise, / You set with honour and with honour rise." Argyle had served with distinction under Marlborough, but I can find nothing about places being lost that had to be restored. Pope, incidentally, praises Argyle as statesman and solder: "Argyle, the State's whole Thunder born to wield, / And shake alike the Senate and the Field" ( Epilogue to the Satires , Dialogue II , ll. 86-87). Charlotte Smith, better known as a novelist although her sonnets received some praise, is represented by three poems in the pages of the SM , only one of which, "Chloe's Picture," "In vain they sweet's ambrosial, fair flow'r" (1793, p. 282), which appeared one month later in the GM (p. 655), being unknown. It is dated "Brighton, June 24." 14 The prose piece by John Hawkesworth mentioned above is a long "Letter from Dr. Hawkesworth, To a Young Lady Just Entering Upon the World," published in the July 1796 SM (pp. 451-454), almost fifty years after it was written, for it is dated from Bromley, Kent, Hawkesworth's home, "14th Dec. 1748." In brief, Hawkesworth advises the young lady to gain the good will of others, to be punctual, to treat servants courteously but not familiarly, and to honor and obey her parents. She should not speak ill of others, flatter, undertake to keep secrets, and ask too much bounty of her father. In conclusion he wrote that "no real present happiness need to be forfeited to purchase the future; for virtue and piety, at once secure every good of body and mind both in time and eternity." With the injunction that she peruse his letter frequently, he signed, "I am, dear Miss, Your affectionate friend, Jno. Hawkesworth." One other prose piece, a letter "From Mr. [Samuel] Foote" to an unnamed "dear H*******," whom I take to be Archibald Hamilton, one of the executors of Foote's will 15 appeared in the December 1797 number (pp. 865-866). It is dated "Paris, Sept. 27"; the year date, ascertainable from the statement "Dunkirk is totally demolished," is 1765. 16 As the number of extant letters by Foote is not great, I quote it in its entirety. YOU receive once again a letter from your humble fervant at Paris: Paris , the paradiſe for women,—the purgatory for men,—and the hell for horſes:—a purgatory from which I can hardly think we Engliſh owe our deliverance to the interceſſion of French catholics: but however it happens, whether from the fervency of their prayers, or the extravagance of their bills, there are very few of our countrymen in it; and to-morrow I ſhall leſſen the number, by a ſhort trip into the province of Anjou. I was yeſterday at the chriſtening of the prince of Conde's ſon, at Verſailles. The archbiſhop of Rheims waſhed his face; which, to ſay truth, it very much wanted. The boy was nine years of age, had the king for his ſponſor, and the whole blood of the Bourbons attended.—Hume introduced three or four of our boobies.—I own I was a little ſtruck, to ſee a Scotch deiflical ſchool-maſter the Engliſh miniſter at the court of his majeſty tres Chretienne .—Dunkirk is totally demoliſhed.—The French are moſt confoundedly frightened at the thoughts of Pitt's being in power.—Wilkes is expected every moment at Paris.—The dauphin is dangerouſly ill.—And ſo much for the news of the day. I hope my little affairs are by this time concluded.—It is impoſible for me to expreſs how much I am indebted to your kind aſſiſtance.—Pray let miſs S******* be ſupplied in all her reaſonable wants.—I wiſh ſome proper proviſion could be thought of for her.—She is really a very good girl, but, you know, my plan is œconomy.—One of our writers obſerves, that "after forty there is no ſporting with life;" now, though I love a joke as well as any man can do, it is high time for me to reflect, that _____ hæ nugæ feria ducunt In mala. So much for moraliſing and Latin.—I ſhall expect, with impatience, a line from you.—Let me know the ſtate of the ſtage, and whether Garrick—but, I think, I gave you my opinion that the great Roſcius would condeſcend to exhibit before a tavern kitchen fire in the dog-days, provided he could get a ſop in the pan. Adieu, dear H*******, and believe me, most affectionately, yours, SAMUEL FOOTE. The letter would seem, then, to be authentic, for, among other things, David Hume was in Paris at this time, having arrived there in October 1763 and not leaving until 1766 ( DNB ). Wilkes, touring Italy, returned to Paris in the autumn of 1765 ( DNB ). He and Foote were old friends. Foote was born in 1720, and hence the quoted reference to "after forty" was true of him in 1765. And evidently this was one of the many times that he felt less than charitably about Garrick. "The dauphin is dangerously ill," Foote wrote on Sept. 27, 1765; the dauphin died on Friday, December 20, some two months later ( GM , p. 589). I have not identified Miss S of the seven asterisks; the Latin tag is from Horace's Ars Poetica (ll. 451-452). Finally, although the literature on Dr. Johnson is so vast, three additional bits should be added, as two of them almost surely have been ignored by Johnsonians, while the third, in the realm of anecdotal literature, may have surfaced in some obscure place I have overlooked, for I have gone to the usual sources. The March 1739 SM (pp. 131-133) printed the third of S. Toupee's "Letter[s] relating to the Stage," one in which he devoted half of the space to Henry Brooke's Gustavus Vasa , the play Johnson defended in his early (May 1739) Compleat Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage , to give it a shortened title. Toupee had nothing good to say about Brooke or his play, during the course of his remarks pointing out that the January 1739 GM contained some verses in praise of Brooke, "with notes." The poem in the GM (p. 40), by George Ogle, "from his Imitation of Hor. E.3.L.I.," praises Brooke's modesty, with a note to the effect that he was thirty years old before his friends could prevail upon him to have his poem Universal Beauty published. Another note states that Brooke "has several pieces by him that came as near as any to Milton in manner and stile," while the last of the four notes is on "A tragedy, whose merits the publick will have an opportunity of judging this winter," i.e. Gustavus Vasa . Toupee writes, penultimately, "Here, Sir, at present, ends the history of the tragedy of Gustavus Vasa ; a piece ruined in its success by nothing but the author's impatient thirst of praise, in not waiting till it was found its due." The fullest account of Johnson's Compleat Vindication does not mention the GM poem, nor, more importantly, the adverse criticism of the play and its author. 17 The anecdotes about Johnson that appeared in October 1797 (pp. 721-722), with one exception, appear not to be known. The first of these has Johnson at Lord Lansdowne's seat in Wiltshire in the company of the late Mr. Cumming, the Quaker. Johnson repeated part of his letter to Chesterfield, but refused to repeat the performance for a late-comer, saying, "I told the circumstance first for my own amusement, but I will not be dragged in as a story-teller to a company." Perhaps less credence may be given to the next anecdote, one about Dr. Johnson's night clothes. Mrs C---- having subscribed for several copies of Johnson's first edition of Shakespeare, she told Mr M---- (a particular acquaintance of the Doctor) that she wished above all things to be introduced to the Author, and that she would wave all ceremony, and pay him the first visit. Johnson, being apprised of this, consented, and a morning was appointed for the rendezvous. The parties accordingly arrived at Johnson's chambers in Gray's Inn about one o'clock; who, after thundering at the outer door for near a quarter of an hour, Mr M---- at last peeped through the key-hole, and observed Johnson just issuing from his bed, in his shirt, without a night-cap (which by the by he never wore), the pot de chambre in one hand, and the key in the other. In this situation he unlocked the door, when, spying a lady, he gravely turned round, "begged she would walk into another room, and he would have the pleasure of waiting on her immediately." As soon as ever Mrs C---- had recovered her surprise, she observed to Mr M----, "what a fortunate thing it was for her, that Johnson's milliner had not cheated him of his linen as much before as she had behind . I suspect this to be apocryphal. Others with other interests will doubtless find matters of some importance, small or great, in the volumes of the SM . Some seven pages (215-221) of F.A. Pottle's Literary Career of James Boswell (1929) are given over to Boswell's contributions to the SM . Perhaps there are other well-known Scots contributions waiting to be identified.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Isaac Reed's 1785 Variorum Shakespeare by William C. Woodson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Studies in Bibliography , Volume 28 (1975), I argued that the 1785 variorum edition of Shakespeare is distinct from its predecessor, the 1778 variorum, and in Volume 31 (1978) I reported the survival of the printer's copy, which confirms that the 1785 text was carelessly seen through the press. In Volume 32 (1979) Arthur Sherbo described the 1785 edition as "George Steevens's Variorum Shakespeare." Professor Sherbo seriously misconstrues the edition, however, both when he dismisses Isaac Reed as the editor, and more inexplicably when he concludes that Edmond Malone made no important contribution to the text or notes. Some of the confusion arises from his belief that Steevens gave the edition to Reed virtually ready for printing: Actually, Steevens handed over a substantial portion of the edition [to Reed], including some 445 additions, revisions, and omissions in his own 1778 notes. Another approximately 470 notes are given over to reductions in the number of parallels Steevens had lavished on passages in the 1778 edition and to cross references . . . . Together, these 900 or more notes comprise the greatest addition to the 1785 Variorum . . ." (pp. 241-242). Apart from the mixed system of classification, in which he counts the subtractions from Steevens' notes among the additions, Professor Sherbo does not mention that Reed took full responsibility for subtracting the superfluous passages, mostly in the event Steevens', as he prepared the edition. Reed announced in the Advertisement that he was "the occasion of their removal" and further "desires it to be understood that no person is answerable for any of these innovations but himself" (I, iii). Reed's determination to make the notes less pedantic and more scholarly also may be seen in his massive importation of notes from Edmond Malone. Professor Sherbo's collation of Malone's contribution badly misrepresents Malone's importance: "Malone contributed only five new notes to the 1785 variorum," he asserts, and in total gave only "about 36 notes" (p. 243). My collation of the thirty plays for which printer's copy survives (i.e. omitting Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet , Julius Caesar , Much Ado about Nothing , Henry IV , Part Two , and Love's Labor's Lost , British Library shelfmark C.117.e.3), finds that Malone gave for these thirty plays 1099 notes. Not only are Malone's notes qualitatively superior to Steevens', but also they repeatedly challenge his textual authority. Fortunately, some significant correspondence among the editors has survived, and it further clarifies Reed's control as well as Malone's participation in the edition. Finally, while I have no objection to Professor Sherbo's account of the continuing amenities observed between Steevens and Malone, it is inescapable that Malone's disdain for Steevens' text (1778) forever drove a wedge between these once intimate friends. John Nichols, a friend to Reed, Steevens, and Malone, wrote in his Literary History (V, 450) that a serious quarrel arose over how Steevens could respond to Malone's 1785 notes. James Prior, in his Life of Edmond Malone (1860), pp. 121-122, also describes this incident, with the stronger conclusion that the quarrel ended their professional relationship. I have not been able to document this quarrel, and Professor Sherbo establishes from published accounts that the two remained courteous after 1785. Nevertheless, Professor Sherbo's conclusion that almost nothing changed because of the 1785 edition would be possible only if his collation were accurate. But Malone's frequent repudiation of Steevens' 1778 text, considered together with the awkward plagiarism of Malone's notes and emendations, reveals that the edition painfully diminished the mutual admiration which had once nurtured their friendship. Far from lionizing Steevens, Isaac Reed's 1785 variorum actually helped focus attention on the question of George Steevens' competence as a textual editor. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Thanks to some surviving correspondence, the events leading up to the publication of the 1785 edition may be examined in more detail than has been possible. In 1783, with the urging of Dr. Farmer, Isaac Reed accepted the task of re-editing the 1778 variorum from his friend George Steevens, who for reasons not entirely clear had elected to retire "forever" from editing Shakespeare. He had edited Twenty Plays from the Shakespearean quartos in 1766, and he assisted Dr. Johnson in bringing out the 1773 variorum, which he revised in 1778. Edmond Malone became his protégé during the preparation of the 1778 edition, to which Malone published a two volume Supplement in 1780. Malone praised Steevens in his 1780 Preface, specifically extolling his mentor's achievement as a textual editor: because of the "diligent collation of all the old copies . . . and the judicious restoration of readings, the text of this author seems now finally settled" (p. iii). Despite his praise for the text, however, Malone suggested a number of textual changes in his 1780 notes, which were meant to supplement the 1778 edition. Malone's criticism of the 1778 text grew more pointed in his 1783 Second Appendix to the 1778 edition, for by this time Malone had completed a full historical collation of all the plays, something to which Dr. Johnson and Steevens had only pretended. Malone to be sure remained openly courteous to Steevens' 1778 edition, actually praising it in the Preface as an "excellent edition" (p. iii). Yet part of the explanation for Steevens' early retirement at the age of forty-seven could have been his aversion to the mounting criticism of his text. Whatever his reasons, Steevens stepped down as the reigning editor and transferred full responsibility to Reed. Although the transfer is competently described by Nichols and Prior, the uncatalogued correspondence by Steevens in the Folger Library actually preserves some of the crucial letters. Steevens wrote Malone on November 28, 1782, announcing that "I never mean again to appear Again as Editor of Shakespeare; nor will such assistance as I may be able to furnish go towards any future gratuitous publication of the same Author. Ingratitude and impertinence, from several of the Booksellers, have been my reward for conducting Two laborious editions, both of which except a few copies, are already sold." On April 15, 1783, Steevens again wrote to Malone, this time to let him know that Reed had been given full responsibility for the 1785 edition: "I return my best thanks for your communication, and, with your leave, will put it into the hands of Mr. Reed, to whom I had already given up your former sheets to be used at his discretion. As to his future publication, I am determined not to see a line of it till I purchase the whole. I shall not therefore become answerable for the reception or rejection of a single note that may be offered." The sheets to which Steevens refers are the proofs of Malone's 1780 Supplement and the 1783 Second Appendix , which had recently been published. Steevens continues the letter by encouraging Malone to prepare his own edition: "there is no man more capable of conducting one than yourself. I have done with the pursuit, and shall abstain even from troubling Mr. Reed with a syllable of advice in the course of his undertaking." In his Literary History (V, 441-442), Nichols records a similar letter from Steevens describing his intention to give Reed full control of the edition: March 27, 1783 If the management of a new edition of that author's Plays (without the slightest interference from those would-be-critics, some of the booksellers) is entrusted to Mr. Reed, and it shall be agreed to pay him satisfactorily for his trouble, my copy will be at his service. I pledge myself also not to molest him about my own notes, or even to see a single page of the work before it is printed off and published. Whatever may be the general resolution as to the editor recommended, my MS. shall pass into no other hands. Thus there can be no doubt that Steevens made a careful and public decision to give Reed a free hand with the edition, and that he had no desire to be regarded as the editor of the 1785 variorum. Reed already was an accomplished editor, with much of his experience coming from his edition of Dodsley's Old Plays . Steevens asked him in 1778 to edit the manuscript of The Witch , and a brief perusal of Reed's bibliography in the Dictionary of National Biography discloses that he had seen thirty-two volumes through the press before the 1785 variorum. Steevens moreover had praised Reed's editorial assistance in his 1778 Preface, writing that "no man is more conversant with English publications both ancient and modern, or more willing to assist the literary undertakings of others" (p. 239). Consequently, Professor Sherbo's belief that Reed had insufficient experience to edit Shakespeare simply disregards his obvious qualification for the task. The charming letter by which Steevens made the transfer of his materials to Reed was written April 9, 1783: "I send you the fixtures of the old shop, together with as much of the good will of it as lies in my power to bestow. You will probably inherit all the custom, except Mr. Malone's, who intends to "froth &amp; lime" at a new house to which it seems he hath got a license." Steevens evidently hoped that the 1785 edition would establish Reed in the Shakespeare franchise; little could he have known that the appearance of Reed's edition would place his text under the long shadow of his former protégé, Malone. Reed meanwhile publicly accepted full responsibility for the editorial work, as we learn from the draft of a letter he wrote in response to Ritson's critique of the 1785 edition ( The Quip Modest; A Few Words . . . Occasioned by a Republication . . . Revised and Augmented by the Editor of Dodsley's Old Plays , 1788): undated I must however intreat if you find occasion to write again concerning the last Edition of Shakespeare you will be pleased to consider me &amp; me only as the Author of every line signed Editor. From the time I undertook the Edition (&amp; surely its imperfections will prove it) no person whatsoever interfered in the conduct of it directly or indirectly but myself nor did any person see a single sheet of it except myself either before or after it came from the Press &amp; the Printers to the best of my knowledge and recollection. Every word therefore under the signature I adopted is I think I may claim in the most unqualified sense. (Folger Mss.c.b.11) Reed to be sure is intent on defending Steevens from the innuendo Ritson launched, that the 1785 notes signed Editor were actually written by Steevens; but in doing so, Reed also independently confirms Steevens' testimony, that Reed absolutely controlled the edition. In view of this correspondence it is not surprising that most of the marginalia in the surviving printer's copy turns out to be in Reed's autograph. Although he was able to tip in most of Malone's clipped proof sheets and many of the new manuscript notes, he also transcribed many notes from Malone's 1780 and 1783 proof sheets, as well as a considerable number from the other contributors, including Ritson's critique of the 1778 edition ( Remarks, Critical and Illustrative , 1783), and John Monck Mason's Comments on the Last Edition of Shakespeare's Plays , 1785. Mason's comments became available late in the preparation of the 1785 edition and they appear only in the last volumes. Reed's most amazing transcriptions, however, are of George Steevens' new notes, most of which in fact are in Reed's hand. Despite the confidence shown in him by Steevens, Reed voiced serious anxiety about his performance as editor in his Advertisement to the 1785 edition: When the very great and various Talents of the last Editor, particularly for this work, are considered, it will occasion much regret to find, that having superintended two Editions of his favourite Author through the Press, he has at length declined the laborious office and committed the care of the present Edition to one who laments with the rest of the world the secession of his predecessor; very conscious, as well of his inferiority, as of the injury the publication will sustain by the change. (p. ii). Reed's profession of modesty was not merely a mannered convention, however, since he had not proofed the 1785 sheets very well at all, and allowed many compositorial changes in the text to stand, as I reported in volume 31, and as he implies in his letter to Ritson already quoted. Nevertheless, he received two hundred pounds from the booksellers, according to the cash receipt in the Folger Library (Mss.a.167), "for revising an Edition of the Works of Shakespeare." Malone warned Reed early on that Steevens had not corrected the 1773 errata in the 1778 edition and inquired if he might not wish to make these changes as subsequent volumes were coming through the press: undated Dear Sir, I am sorry to inform you that Mr. Steevens has omitted to correct the Errata in the last edition of Shakespeare by which means they are all repeated in this. However it is not too late with respect to the remaining volumes, which is the reason of my troubling you on the subject. The table of Errata takes up three pages in Vol. 1. I request the favour of an answer to my former note relative to the time of the volume going to Rivington, &amp; which it is. I beg also you will let me know what signature I shall affix to my edition to such of your notes as are subscribed Editor, in your own. I am, Dear Sir, Very faithfully yours, E. Malone (turn over) When I requested you to change the words "the first &amp; second folio read"—in any of my notes, to "The first folio, the only authenticated of this play, reads"—I meant, to make that change only in those plays, of which there is no quarto edition. In those plays, which are both in folio &amp; quarto, I would wish the change to be—to "The first folio reads" &amp; c. Excuse this minute trouble. (Bodleian Library, Mss. Montagu d. 18, f. 5) This letter indicates Malone's keen interest in the progress of the 1785 edition as it was being printed, his recognition of Reed as the editor, and evidently his access to the 1785 proof sheets. These proof sheets would also let him know, before the entire edition was published, the fate of his 1780 and 1783 notes, as well as the disposition of the new notes he was providing to Reed. Malone's serial reading of the 1785 edition would give him increasing discomfort, and he virtually stopped contributing new notes mid-way through the printing of the edition. Reed's labors were completed late in 1785 and the edition was advertised in The Whitehall Evening Post , December 17-20, 1785, as "this day" being published. Despite Reed's apology for the editorial flaws in the 1785 edition, the publication was well received in the Critical Review , 62 (1786): . . . the edition before us is amended. The corrections are more frequent: the text, though faulty, has still fewer deviations from the original copies than in the former editions; and the quotations are often abridged. There is still farther room for retrenchment. In every view, however, this edition is the best that we have seen. (pp. 322-323) The review continued in the next volume: "We must now pursue Mr. Reed in his improvements . . ." (p. 17). Malone's notes were singled out for approval, and notice was also given to the fact that Steevens gave some new notes. The positive reviews, however, did not deceive Steevens, who knew that Reed not only had botched the correcting of the proofs but also had introduced some fanciful readings of his own. Steevens confessed as much to Malone: "I was so heartily sickened by these Volumes of innaccuracy, that you will find little in them that can be of service to you. I shall never go throughout our Author again with diligence, till he appears in a more questionable shape" (Folger, undated). Joseph Ritson's critique of the 1785 edition observed that Reed even had omitted an errata list, and he offered one of his own devising ( The Quip Modest , pp. iii-iv).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In preparing for the printer a revised copy of the 1778 variorum, Reed's task as editor involved three primary duties: he had to do a number of housekeeping chores, which he performed diligently; he had to select new notes, either pasting them in the margins or transcribing them; and he had the opportunity to make changes in the text. He also of course had the responsibility of seeing the edition through the press. In the following description of Reed's work in preparing the 1785 edition, I will limit myself to the thirty plays in the printer's copy, although I also have collated its 204 marked textual changes against the printed copy of the 1785 edition, Malone's of 1790, and Steevens' of 1793. What emerges is the measurable advance which the 1785 edition made over its predecessors. The housekeeping of the edition gave Reed many opportunities to demonstrate his diligence. In accord with the signature on the will, the spelling of Shakespeare was altered to omit the medial "e," the letter "B." was expanded to Beaumont, the spelling of Grey was changed to Gray, the few missing footnote numbers were added, the singular exit was made plural where necessary, and minor mistakes in printing the 1778 notes were corrected (e.g., "lost" changed to "last" in Dr. Johnson's note, I, 23). More importantly, because Reed deleted most of Warburton's notes, he was obliged to remove also Dr. Johnson's responses to them. As a result, however, the 1785 edition contains very few examples of Dr. Johnson's 1765 notes. Whenever possible, Reed preferred to substitute a cross reference for a quoted passage from Shakespeare, and so began the disappearance of the easily considered similar passages at the foot of the variorum page. To the same end, some superfluous citations were swept out of the notes left standing, so that the number of parallels was somewhat reduced; this occurred primarily in Steevens' notes, since he regularly had offered a compilation of similarities which often was disproportionate to the complexity of what he was glossing. Thus in The Tempest his six instances illustrating "frippery" become three, the five instances of "passion" as a verb are made three, and the seven instances of "flammel" are reduced to two. Reed also added many new notes. Over a thousand came from Malone, including for the early volumes 273 which are handwritten; some of these modified his 1780 or 1783 notes. He also added 305 new notes from Steevens and an additional 24 which were first printed in Malone's 1780 Supplement . Reed completely deleted 370 of Steevens' notes. Some of Steevens' new notes are in his own hand and are tipped in, but for the most part the new notes by Steevens have been transcribed by Reed. Reed himself gives 192 new notes, and he reports the opinions of Ritson, Dr. Farmer, and others in an additional thirty-six notes. Steevens reported Dr. Farmer in thirty-three notes, and this life-long friend of all three editors stands alone in about a half-dozen notes. Dr. Farmer entertained his friends in Cambridge and was entertained by them when he came to the city; in fact, although Professor Sherbo believes that Reed had insufficient time to edit the 1785 edition, his diary reveals that he left on September 27, 1784, for his annual visit to Cambridge. Less is known about most of the other contributors, except John Monck Mason and Joseph Ritson, whose critiques of the 1778 edition were incorporated into the 1785 commentary. A few dozen notes came from Rev. Henley, identified in the 1778 edition (I,85) as being from Harrow on the Hill, and an equal number altogether from Justice Blackstone, Brand, Collins, Henderson, Musgrave, Bishop Percy, Tollet, Tyrwhitt, Upton, Thomas Warton, and of course John Nichols. Dr. Lort, an occasional dinner companion and host to the three editors, also made a few contributions. In isolated instances these minor contributors influenced the text. Dr. Farmer is clearly responsible for eight emendations, and Reed also may claim eight without dispute. Often unacknowledged, Ritson stands behind twenty emendations; Malone is responsible, also at times without acknowledgement, for sixty-three textual emendations. Steevens and Tyrwhitt each are credited with five changes in the text, and ten more are made by various hands. Omitting the corrected errata, the obvious housekeeping, the plural of exit and the alternative spelling of "oh," there are 86 more changes in the text which are unsigned. Because of Steevens' strong repudiation of the 1785 edition, we have good reason to suppose that Reed made many of these changes on his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The fact that Malone had completed a full historical collation of the text gave his commentary notes an authority and cogency seldom present in Steevens'. Malone insisted again and again that the 1778 text return to the reading of the copy-text, usually the first folio or occasionally a quarto. One way to remedy the almost embarrassing intellectual imbalance in the commentary was to take textual emendations from Malone without crediting him, which actually happens in 21 places; the theft is easy to detect, because Malone's printed arguments in 1780 and 1783 for the changes were in all these instances simply omitted. For a similar reason, evidently, four of Malone's collation notes were attributed to Reed, Theobald, and Dr. Johnson, and eight were directly credited to Steevens. At least thirteen of Ritson's emendations are also plagiarized by the edition. Steevens, who announced he had retired forever from editing, reports nine new collation notes, some of which offer to correct Malone's collation published in 1783, while in another twenty new notes he defends his 1778 text against the emendations proposed by Malone. The cumulative effect of this petty plagiarism and sniping must have soured Malone against giving new commentary in manuscript to Reed. Although it cannot be established that the volumes were printed in precise serial order, Malone's new notes and the volumes in which they appear indicate a sharp falling off after the fifth volume: I(78); II(6); III(22); IV(101); V(46); VI(7); VII(3); VIII(4); IX(3); X(1). The highest count of notes stolen from Malone (5), emendations stolen from Malone (7), and new collation notes from Steevens and Reed (9) also comes in the fourth volume. There is only one more note stolen from Malone after the fifth volume, and only once again do Steevens or Reed offer a new collation. Malone's textual emendations are stolen only eight more times after the fifth volume. Malone's reaction to this high-handedness is not recorded in any letters, and a perusal of Reed's diaries reveals that Malone did not break his social or professional relationship with Reed because of the 1785 edition. Unlike Steevens, who was generally incapable of sustaining personal relationships, Malone had the widely acknowledged gift of social grace and ease. Yet in his private hours the treatment he received must have been an irksome experience to contemplate. Some glimpse of his deeper feelings may be revealed in his collection of Shakespeariana now preserved in the Bodleian Library. Among the pamphlets and clippings which record the history of Shakespearean scholarship in his lifetime, Malone preserved many accounts of the damage which Steevens had inflicted on the careers of his contemporary Shakespeareans. What Malone had in common with these men was that each of them had challenged the ability of Steevens as a textual editor. One of the most poignant incidents concerns Dr. Kenrick, who undertook an edition of Shakespeare based on a full collation of David Garrick's superb collection of the quartos. He was apparently double-crossed by the booksellers' cabal, who originally promised Kenrick 100 guineas a volume; when Steevens offered to do the edition gratis, however, the cabal refused to publish Kenrick. Some measure of blame also seems to fall on Garrick, who knew what was afoot even as he made promises to Kenrick. Kenrick recounts the events in the Morning Chronicle (Malone dates it 1774). He was permanently blocked by the appearance of the 1773 edition, also edited gratuitously, for it seems to have tied up the booksellers with copyright obligations. Kenrick casts a scornful eye at the 1773 edition, "replete with typographical errors, inelegant as incorrect . . . . I say nothing of such restorations and elucidations of the text as would be peculiar to my own edition." Kenrick complained that Steevens' gambit to block a potential rival had "rendered the labour and study of a considerable part of my life entirely useless." Charles Jennens also felt hurt and abused by Steevens. His edition of King Lear (1770) received an extraordinarily harsh notice in the Critical Review , and he accused Steevens of instigating it so as to obliterate a rival editor ( The Tragedy of King Lear . . . Vindicated , 1772). Jennens criticized the careless collation in Dr. Johnson's 1765 edition and Steevens' Twenty Plays (1766); both editors, he wrote, having "published an edition of Shakespeare without success (and whose many and gross errors and neglects have, as they occurred in the course of the collating, have been taken notice of in the new edition of Lear ) are combined together, as co-editors of another edition [i.e. the 1773 variorum]," (p. 3). Although Jennens was attacked in the Critical Review for being too exact in his collation, which is the sort of defense Steevens might mount, it is difficult to conclude with Jennens that Steevens controlled the Critical Review . For example, when Capell complained in his Notes and Various Readings (1783), that Steevens had pilfered heavily from his 1768 text, the complaint was fully aired in the Critical Review (56, 404), which printed much of Capell's attack on the "regular system of plagiarism" and "the industry with which the purloining trade has been pursued," even though the reviewer did add the disclaimer that the charge had been "completely refuted." By 1783, when Ritson mocked Malone for having endorsed Steevens' 1778 text, Malone doubtless already regretted what he wrote in his 1780 Supplement . Ritson expresses Malone's dilemma bluntly: What an abuse of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character, to tell them, that "by a diligent collation of all the old copies hitherto discovered, and the judicious restoration of ancient readings, the text of this author seems now finally settled!" To what better cause can we ascribe such unfounded assertions than to indolence and temerity? Since, had the ingenious writer compared the old and present editions through a single play, he must necessaryly (sic) have perceived, that all the old copies had NOT been diligenely collated, that ancient readings had NOT been judiciously restored, and that the text is no more finally settled at present than it was in the time of Theobald, Hanmer, and Warburton: nay, that it is, at large, in the same state of innaccuracy and corruption in which it was left by mr. Rowe." ( Remarks , pp. iv-v) Ritson put his finger squarely on the issue, but Malone chose to suffer in silence, a tactic he maintained even in the publication of his own 1790 edition, when he virtually ignored Steevens in his account of the history of the text. John Monck Mason, who had also collated Shakespeare, aptly summarizes the growing public case against Steevens' competence as a textual editor: he "seems to have acted rather from caprice, than any settled principle" ( Comments , p. viii). Thus it is undeniable that Steevens' reputation as an editor, already under attack from various quarters, suffered further from the inclusion of so many of Malone's notes in the 1785 edition, for in these notes Malone repudiated scores of emendations Steevens had allowed. Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that although the integrity of Steevens' 1778 text was challenged by a number of Malone's contemporaries, Steevens' lack of editorial fidelity never seemed to shake the confidence of the booksellers or his popular successors, for as I reported in volume 29, Steevens' 1793 text was dominant into the mid-nineteenth century, until it was at last rejected by Charles Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Reed's sympathy with the increasing editorial conservatism of his fellow Shakespeareans is unmistakable in the marked emendations in the 1785 printer's copy, for they restore Folio or quarto readings in 117 instances. Only forty-five emendations abandon the Folio readings of 1778, and they are a mixed lot, ranging from the revision of spellings and changes in speech tags, to the less compelling conjectures by his correspondents, including eight by Dr. Farmer. While Steevens claims only a few new readings in the 1785 text, it is possible that he made other changes too. Nevertheless, there is no instance I have seen in the 1778 or 1785 text of Steevens actually defending the restoration of a Folio reading. Consequently, since fifty-two of the eighty-six anonymous emendations in 1785 do restore Folio text, the bulk of them are probably Reed's. He also is the likely hand behind the twenty anonymous new readings which neither Malone (1790) nor Steevens (1793) would follow. Although his editorial self-effacement has obscured his contribution to the 1785 variorum, his quiet challenge to the laxity of Steevens' 1778 text should win Isaac Reed a niche in the history of Shakespeare's editors. In the face of the rising textual conservatism, be it noted, Steevens remained staunchly unregenerate, and in the Advertisement to his 1793 edition (p. xi) he mocked his fellow editors for believing any quarto or the Folio to represent Shakespeare's "genuine text": "few literary occurences are better understood, than that it came down to us discoloured by 'the variation of every soil' through which it had flowed, and that it stagnated at last in the muddy reservoir of the first folio." Only Steevens would be capable of retailing such a belief by this late date, or of comparing the integrity of the Folio text "with the innocence of females nursed in a camp and educated in a bagnio" (p. xii). With such a man, it was better not to quarrel at all.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Variation, Accident, and Intention in William Blake's The Book of Urizen by Robert N. Essick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The relationship between the interpretation of a printed image and its means of production takes on unique twists and turns in William Blake's illuminated books. Because they were etched in relief and white line on copperplates, the printing bodies of these works have the stability and resistance to revision of stereotype plates. 1 In contrast, the exigencies of relief inking and printing and Blake's tendency to add hand work to individual impressions introduce a great many variations into the process. He was also in the habit of arranging his plates in different sequences and producing apparently complete copies of his books with fewer plates than others. A good case in point is The [ First ] Book of Urizen , etched in 1794 and known in seven copies with between 24 and 28 plates printed on rectos only. 2 Six of these copies (A-F) are color printed. This technique, as well as the 1794 watermarks in copies B and D, strongly suggest that all six were printed ca. 1794-1796. The last copy printed (G), on paper watermarked 1815, is the only one colored entirely by hand rather than a combination of color printing and subsequent work on the impressions with pen and brush. Only two copies (A-B) have all 28 plates; no two copies have the plates arranged in the same order. Copies D and F have the same number of plates, but both lack plates 4 and 16, the latter a full-page design the absence of which does not affect the narrative sequence. Copy C also lacks plate 16, contains a second impression of plate 2, and is without two text plates, 7 and 8. Both copies B and C contain plates printed in two colors of ink, suggesting that they are composites of two press runs. The inclusion of plates 8 and 10 in all but copy C adds a further anomaly, for the text on both these plates begins a chapter headed "IV." 3 Copy E lacks plate 4, three full-page designs, and the final plate, the absence of which might be explained by some accident, or action taken by a binder, that altered the original composition of the volume. The last copy (G) is unique in having 27 plates, with only plate 4 absent. As in copy D in 26 plates, Blake foliated copy G in one continuous numbered sequence, thereby indicating that he considered it a complete copy of the book. Among these many major variations, the absence of plate 4 from four copies, two of which are continuously foliated in Blake's hand, is the most difficult to explain. That plate includes the end of verse 3 of Chap. II, begun on plate 2, five additional verses from the second chapter, the heading for Chap. III, and one and a half following verses (see Illustration). Without plate 4, the incomplete sentence on plate 3 can be completed grammatically (and perhaps even narratively 4 ) by the first two lines of text on plate 5, but the verse numbering becomes redundant with a verse "3" indicated at the last line on plate 3 and again at the third line of plate 5. Further, we are left without a heading for Chap. III until the running head of "Urizen C: III" above verses numbered 9 through 11 on plate 6. Unless these inconsistencies are rectified in some way, the reader knows immediately that something is missing. One might surmise that plate 4 contained, in its text or design, something at such variance from Blake's final intentions for Urizen that he felt compelled to leave it out of later copies (perhaps D-F, certainly G) of the book—in spite of the resulting disruptions in his chapter and verse numbers. Much of the text on plate 4 is devoted to Urizen's only speech in the poem. It has generally been taken to be a central passage because it introduces important images of Urizen's self-alienation from the Eternals, his "books formd of metals," and his desire to impose his "one command" on all existence. The design at the bottom of the plate, showing a man seated behind a curtain of dark rain or flames and grasping his hair with both hands, is completely consistent with other tormented figures portrayed in the book, including the full-page design (plate 12) of Urizen submerged in water which may illustrate lines 21-23 on plate 4. In short, much in the text can be considered essential, not peripheral, and nothing in the design leaps to one's attention as a reason for cancellation. Further, in the list of publications Blake sent Dawson Turner on 9 June 1818, he described "Urizen" as having "28 Prints." 5 If Blake's statement in this letter, written long after the initial etching and printing of Urizen , represents his final intentions for the book, then it seems reasonable to assume that copies with fewer than the full complement of 28 plates may have been printed earliest, before all the plates had been etched. This line of reasoning apparently stands behind Bentley's belief that the absence of plates 4 and 16 from copies D-F indicates that they were printed before copies A-B with all 28 plates. But if the presence of 28 plates indicates Blake's later, perhaps even final, intentions for the completion of the book, why does copy G—the most highly finished and the last printed—lack plate 4? A previously recorded, but generally ignored, loose impression of Urizen plate 4 provides some answers to this question (see Illustration). More importantly, its unique characteristics offer insights into Blake's working methods and the ways they influenced the contents of his books and our interpretations of them. In the "Addenda" to Blake Books , p. 953, Bentley lists an impression of Urizen plate 4 in "An Anonymous Collection " and suggests that it was "perhaps . . . intended for copy G," now in the Rosenwald Collection of the Library of Congress. 6 Several features of this print, which I acquired privately in February 1984, indicate that it was almost certainly printed by Blake as part of copy G but rejected by him just before the final stages of production. The paper is the same type of off-white wove found in copy G. Like twenty leaves in that volume, this impression of plate 4 shows no watermark. The pumpkin-orange ink is of the same color and grainy texture as in copy G. 7 The only other extant Urizen plate printed in a similar color is a single impression of plate 1 among a group of three unfinished proofs (Beinecke Library, Yale University). That plate, however, is color printed, a medium which immediately distinguishes it from the separate impression of plate 4 and from copy G. In both, the text areas are very carefully printed but the designs are rather thinly and unevenly inked, as is typical of Blake's nineteenth-century relief prints he intended to color extensively by hand. The hand coloring in blue, orange, and reddish-orange on plate 4 matches those colors on several plates in copy G. Most importantly, the separate print and all plates in copy G are surrounded by orange water color over pencil framing lines between 5 and 9 mm. from each side of the plate image. No other extant Urizen prints have framing lines of any sort. One feature of the separate impression of plate 4 distinguishes it from copy G and indicates why it was not included with its companions. The plate image is not properly aligned relative to the sides of the sheet. Although this problem is difficult to see in a monochrome reproduction, the etched margins in the original clearly show that the printed image is tilted about 5° to the right. The hand coloring Blake added around the periphery of the plate constitutes a rather awkward attempt to correct the improper alignment by painting in new margins. The framing line parallels these hand-painted (as distinct from printed) margins. At some point prior to completing the coloring of the design and numbering the plate, Blake apparently decided that his salvage operation was unsuccessful. He then numbered consecutively the other impressions pulled for what thereby became copy G, complete in 27 plates, and omitted this or any other impression of plate 4. In its stead, Blake placed the full-page design of plate 9 and numbered it "4." To rectify the resulting inconsistency in verse numbers, he scratched out, and drew a tendril over, the "3" preceding the last line of text on plate 3 so that the same verse number on plate 5 (the next text plate) is not redundant. This, however, did not correct the problem with chapter numbers, and copy G has no indication of a Chap. III until the running head above verses 9-11 on plate 6, placed and numbered as leaf "7" in copy G following another full-page design. Misalignment is a common problem when printing with an engraver's rolling press. 8 The solution is generally simple enough: either the plate is immediately reprinted, or the edges of the sheet are trimmed parallel to the margins of the plate image. It is evident that Blake did not take the first of these options in the production of copy G. Perhaps he did not notice the error until after he had disposed of his ink, used all available paper, or altered his press—and thus believed it would be quickest and most economical to attempt to rectify the problem on the misaligned impression itself. But why did Blake not exercise the second option and simply trim the edges of the sheet? The only reason for not doing so is that he must have determined the leaf size for his book, and cut at least plate 4 to that size, either prior to printing that plate or, at the very least, prior to discovering its misalignment. Any cutting of the plate would have created a leaf smaller than all others planned for the book. Oddly enough, that physical inconsistency appears to have been less acceptable to Blake than the cancellation of plate 4, at least after he had disrupted its clear printing with attempted repairs. As Bentley notes, the leaves of copy G of Urizen have been "trimmed" to 28.9 x 23 cm. and "gilt." 9 The separate impression of plate 4 is on a sheet 29 x 22.8 cm. and shows no evidence of having ever been gilt or bound with copy G. None of the edges of the sheet are deckled, and it is very likely that Blake printed plate 4, like all plates now in copy G, on a larger sheet. It may be mere happenstance that the dimensions are so close as to suggest that the plate 4 sheet was at some point cut to the same size as copy G and only subsequent shrinking and stretching, or minor trimming during the gilding process, led to the slight differences. But we need not invent such scenarios, or make any assumptions about original sheet sizes, to account for Blake's failure to realign plate 4 by trimming the edges of the sheet. The reduction of the leaf from a predetermined size to which plate 4 had already been cut is an unavoidable consequence of alignment by trimming no matter what the original size of any of the sheets on which copy G was printed. Nor would the basic circumstances affecting Blake's treatment of plate 4 have been any different if he had printed more than one Urizen plate on each sheet, as distinct from printing each on a separate leaf cut to size. 10 In either case, only a predetermined leaf size would have prevented Blake from trimming plate 4 and instead prompted him to attempt alternative measures with pen and brush. The separate impression of plate 4 indicates that Blake originally intended to produce copy G of Urizen in 28 plates, but that a simple error in alignment and Blake's inability to correct it successfully led to the cancellation of a plate bearing 10% of his text. The graphic processes Blake used in his illuminated books were inherently prone to countless minor, unintended variations in inking and printing, but the final form of copy G demonstrates the extent to which accident shaped his texts. It is difficult to imagine that any conventional printer or publisher would allow mechanical accident to play such a large role in selecting the verbal content of a book. Similarly, a conventional understanding of the relationships between meaning and the means of its (re)production would lead us to entertain only conceptual and fully intentional reasons for the major textual variations among copies of The Book of Urizen . Yet Blake's own aesthetic doctrine of the unity of conception and execution, when understood in its most radically literal sense, offers a rationale for the impact of the material and mechanical on his art. In his Public Address of ca. 1810, Blake insists that "Execution is only the result of Invention." 11 Urizen copy G demonstrates that the reverse is also true, and that the means of execution can shape the inventions of the poet. Because Blake the author was his own illustrator, etcher, printer, and bookseller, his daily labors offered the means for a free intermingling of mental creation and material production, each generating the other as a practical corollary to his aesthetic theories. In light of Urizen copy G and its cancelled plate 4, we should be cautious in our assumptions about the reasons for other major variations in the formats of Blake's books. Those reasons may have as much to do with the contingencies of Blake's presswork as his transcendental ideas. Indeed, to his way of thinking there is no absolute distinction between those realms of act and thought. The format of Urizen copy G and the way it came about dramatize a truth about the potential impact of material production on all texts, a truth of central concern to the bibliographer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In 1822, Blake used the term "stereotype" in reference to his first relief etchings; see The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake , ed. David V. Erdman, Newly Revised Edition (1982), p. 272. For the fullest descriptions of Blake's relief and white-line etching techniques, see Robert N. Essick, William Blake Printmaker (1980), pp. 85-164; and Joseph Viscomi, The Art of William Blake's Illuminated Prints (1983). 2 Unless noted otherwise, plate numbers, copy designations, and bibliographic information on these copies of Urizen are based on G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Books (1977), pp. 166-185. Copy E, in 24 plates, has not been traced since its description in Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf 2nd, William Blake's Illuminated Books: A Census (1953), p. 75. Keynes and Wolf state unequivocally that copy E lacks plates 4, 9, 16, and 24. In what follows I have assumed the accuracy of their description, as does Bentley. 3 As Bentley points out in Blake Books , p. 167, plates 7 and 8 "differ from all other plates with text at the top of the page in having no running heads" and thus may have been "etched after the others." But if plate 8 was meant as a replacement for plate 10, also with six numbered verses, it seems very odd indeed for Blake to include both plates in all but one copy of the complete book. 4 With plate 4 in place, the sentence beginning at the end of plate 3 reads "Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity, | Muster around the bleak desarts. . . ." Moving directly from plate 3 to plate 5, the sentence becomes "Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity, | In living creations appear'd | In the flames of eternal fury" ( Complete Poetry and Prose , pp. 71-72). 5 Complete Poetry and Prose , p. 771. 6 This copy is well known from the excellent facsimile published by the Trianon Press for The William Blake Trust in 1958. 7 Bentley, Blake Books , p. 953, states that the ink is "a slightly different shade" of "Orange" from that in copy G. In many of Blake's illuminated books, the ink color varies slightly, and in some cases considerably, from one plate to another. The ink color in copy G is very consistent, and to my eyes the orange of this separate impression of plate 4 has the same shade and texture. 8 Blake owned such a press during most of his working life—see Essick, Printmaker , p. 58, and Bentley, Blake Records (1969), pp. 29, 114, 272 n. 1, 350-351. It is possible to print relief etchings in a typographic press or a screw press, but it is reasonable to assume that Blake used his engraver's press for the high-quality printing of his illuminated books. I know of no evidence that Blake or the journeymen plate-printers of his day used pins to insure correct alignment. 9 Blake Books , chart on pp. 168-169. Bentley records width followed by height; all dimensions given here record height followed by width, as in most print catalogues. I herein correct Bentley's sheet size of "22.4 x 28.9 cm." for the separate impression of plate 4 ( Blake Books , p. 953). The present binding of copy G is dated 1908. 10 There are a few examples of Blake's relief prints on conjugate leaves, including a copy of "The Song of Liberty" in the collection of Mrs. Ramsey Harvey and perhaps copy B of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (Bodleian Library, Oxford). However, Blake seems to have printed most of his relief plates on individual sheets. 11 Complete Poetry and Prose , p. 576.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Nineteenth-Century English Best-Sellers: A Third List by Richard D. Altick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In The English Common Reader (Chicago, 1957; currently available in the Midway Reprint series) I printed, as Appendixes B and C, lists of bestselling books and of the sales of certain mass-circulation periodicals in nineteenth-century England. A further list appeared in SB , 22 (1969), 197-206. The present one represents the gleanings of fifteen more years, with data supplementing the entries in the original compilation marked by asterisks. As before, prospective users of these figures should be warned that they come from sources of greatly varying reliability and are presented here for whatever they may be worth to students of nineteenth-century English literary, publishing, and social history. Prefacing the second list were several paragraphs arguing that an unelaborated statement of the number of editions a book went through, unsupported by specific numbers of copies sold, is of little value in determining the popularity of such an item, particularly in comparison with similar items for which figures are to be found. Two additional pieces of contemporary evidence support the point. One is from Samuel Warren's novel Ten Thousand a Year (1839-41), describing the writing and subsequent publication and puffing of a work by "Mr. Bladdery Pip, a fashionable novelist": "He had seven hundred copies printed off; and, allowing a hundred for a first edition, he varied the title-pages of the remaining six hundred by the words—' Second Edition'—' Third Edition'—' Fourth Edition'—' Fifth Edition'—' Sixth Edition'—and ' Seventh Edition.' By the time that the fourth edition had been announced, there existed a real rage for the book." 1 Allowing for satirical exaggeration, this is probably a credible report of publishing practice insofar as it shows that an "edition" could consist of whatever number of copies the publisher chose for promotional purposes. The claims of puffery apart, there was a practical reason for this flexibility. The number of copies an "edition" might actually have was determined solely by the routine of the publishing house, and therefore might be large or small, depending on the circumstances. As the court's decision in the case of Reade v. Bentley (1858) put it: . . . [E]dition means every quantity of books put forth to the bookselling trade and to the world at one time; and . . . when the advertisements, the printing, and other well-known expenses and acts by a publisher bringing out such a quantity of copies in the ordinary way, are closed, that constitutes the completion of an edition, whether the copies are taken from fixed or moveable plates or types, and whether all the types or plates are broken up or not, and whether all the copies are given forth and advertised for sale, or retained and stored in the warehouse of the publisher. 2 For the sake of putting the figures in this and the preceding lists in perspective, several recently noted statistics from the Victorian Bible trade may be mentioned. In 1875 "an exceedingly small Oxford Bible on exceedingly thin paper" sold a quarter of a million copies within a few weeks. In the 1870s and 1880s, while the Revised Version was being prepared, "Production of a million copies of the Authorized Version was taken for granted, a routine operation perfected over the years." And when the Revised Version of the New Testament was published in 1881, one million copies were sold in a single day. 3 Impressive though some of the figures in the following list may have been to contemporaries, they were almost minuscule when compared with the demand for Bibles. Nonce Literature (Political squibs and other propaganda; sermons) Attention should be called to the sales figures for radical publications in the Reform Bill era gathered in Patricia Hollis' The Pauper Press: A Study in Working-Class Radicalism of the 1830s (1970), pp. 116-124. 1820-23 * John Wade's Black Book ("a storehouse of factual ammunition for the use of radical agitators"): 14,000 by 1831.

      <field name="heading_text">The Raverat Proofs of Mrs. Dalloway by Glenn P. Wright *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Revision, Virginia Woolf confessed to her diary on 6 January 1925, was "the dullest part of the whole business of writing; the most depressing &amp; exacting" (III.4). From extant proofs and letters, we know that she often revised as she read proof and that the work left her discouraged and anxious, not only because she dreaded harsh criticism from her public, but also because she herself was her most demanding critic. After a novel was published, she rarely tinkered with the text—the notable exception being The Voyage Out (DeSalvo 110ff.)—but in any stage prior to publication Woolf did not hesitate to make extensive revisions. Significant because it is the only one of her novels for which corrected proofs are extant, Mrs. Dalloway allows us to observe Woolf's revising at the proof stage as she struggled to put the novel into its final form. Complicating the analysis, however, there are two extant proofsets with Woolf's autograph corrections, and they do not always agree in their readings: one set used for the American (Harcourt) edition is now owned by the Lilly Library at Indiana University; a second set, with fewer corrections, Woolf sent to her friend Jacques Raverat shortly before his death in March 1925. This proofset is now in the Special Collections Department at UCLA (Lukenbill 11-16). A third set, which was used for the British (Hogarth) edition, is not extant and presumably has been destroyed. 1 A list of Woolf's revises for the Raverat proofs is provided in Appendix I, from which one may reconstruct readings of the proofsheets and observe Woolf's revising. Following each lemma appear transcriptions detailing this revision process, according to procedures set forth by Fredson Bowers in "Transcription of Manuscripts" (212-264). Because so many discrepancies exist between the extant proofs and their corrections, it is important not only to offer a description of them but also to attempt to catalogue them as a means of understanding how Woolf went about revising her novel and what chronology these revisions followed. Woolf completed a typescript of Mrs. Dalloway in December 1924 in order that Leonard Woolf might read it while they were at Monks House in Sussex for the Christmas season ( Diary II.325). Returning to London on 2 January, she mailed the typescript to the Edinburgh printing firm, R. &amp; R. Clark, on or shortly before 6 January, where it was promptly set in type. Proofsheets dated 13-19 January were then returned to her for corrections. Allowing for the mails, it is likely she did not receive proofs until 23 or 24 January. Because Mrs. Dalloway was to be published simultaneously in London and New York by two different presses, Woolf received an additional set of proofs (in this case three), and she found herself in the unenviable position of having to correct two identical sets without introducing textual variants through transcription errors or unclear directions to printers in two different companies. In late January Woolf determined to send her personal copy of the proofs to her friend Jacques Raverat, the French painter and former member of the "Neo-Pagans" at Cambridge in the early 1910s. She had not seen Raverat for some years, but she knew that he was near death, suffering with disseminated sclerosis so acute that his wife, Gwen Darwin (the granddaughter of Charles Darwin), had had to tie paint brushes onto his hands so that he could paint ( Letters IV.423). Woolf also knew that Raverat would not live long enough to see Mrs. Dalloway in print, since the novel was scheduled to be published in May (the actual date of publication was 14 May 1925). Because Raverat had praised her collection of stories Monday or Tuesday and her earlier novel Jacob's Room , she wanted him to read what she considered her strongest work to date. Thus, in a letter to Raverat on 24 January, she wrote (III.154): ". . . if you'd really like it, I'll send out the proofs of my novel, which has just arrived, on condition you don't bother to write to me about it, or even read it; and don't mention it to anyone, for fear we should be asked for it, and it wont be out till May. For no other human being in the world would I do this—why, I dont know. But I'm a little morbid about people reading my books." In his biography of Virginia Woolf, Quentin Bell notes that this is the only time, to his knowledge, that she gave anyone except Leonard a set of proofs to read before her work was published (II.107). Trusting that Raverat would be a sympathetic audience, Woolf was worried nonetheless about some parts of Mrs. Dalloway and had complained to her diary that the novel was subject to criticism for being "disjointed because of the mad scenes not connecting with the Dalloway scenes" and because there was some "superficial glittery writing" (II.323). Her letter to Raverat indicates then that she felt some conflict between the urgency to send him the novel, even in an unfinished state, and the need to withhold her creation until its publication. Soon after writing to Raverat, however, Woolf came down with the flu and was unable to work on the proofs for almost two weeks. On 5 February, she sent him an explanation ( Letters III.163): "I was struck down with influenza the very day I wrote to you [i.e., 24 January], and am still in bed. Otherwise, I should have sent off my proofs before, but they were muddled up, and influenza makes me like a wet dish cloth—even to sort them was beyond me. I have left them uncorrected. Much has been re-written. Do a little re-writing on my behalf. Anyhow, don't cast me from you; and say nothing, or anything, as you like. (It will be sent tomorrow, 6th.)" Woolf could hardly have expected Raverat to do any "re-writing": not only was it physically impossible for him, but there would have been little time to receive a reply and incorporate changes if she planned to meet her May deadline. That she was too ill even to sort the proofs suggests that when she says "Much has been re-written," she is referring either to revisions of the manuscript (October-December 1924) or to proof corrections made only for the American and British editions (24 January-5 February 1925). Two statements in this letter are contradicted by the proofs themselves: (1) whereas Woolf states that they are "uncorrected," this is not the case; and (2) although she asserts they will be mailed on 6 February, it is unlikely that she could have made all revises for Raverat in one day. Moreover, on 6 February the Woolfs left for Monks House where she corrected proofs, including the set for Raverat. On 31 pages of the Raverat proofs (R), Woolf made over 50 emendations and inserted between pages 224 and 225 a typescript revision of the scene in which Septimus Smith commits suicide. All revises, except for this typescript and two pencil emendations on pages 175 and 184, are made in the same bright purple ink she used in correcting proofs for the first American edition (A 1 ) and presumably for the first British edition (E 1 ) as well. 2 Given this evidence, we can conclude that all changes for Raverat were made after 6 February. Jacques Raverat died on 7 March in Vence, France, a small town near Nice. Literally on his deathbed, he listened as his wife read aloud Mrs. Dalloway in proof, with Woolf's corrections; and later he dictated a letter praising the novel ( Diary III.7n). This time frame indicates that Woolf could not have waited long after 6 February to mail the proofs to southern France, and since she returned to London on 10 February, a date in mid-February seems the most probable cut-off point. Relaxing in the seclusion of Monks House for four days, she would have made the corrections for Raverat on a first reading of the proofs. This urgency must have encouraged Woolf to undertake a first-round of corrections at Monks House, and after mailing a partially corrected set to Raverat, to continue making revises for A 1 and E 1 . From 6 January to 18 March, she made no entries in her diary—a hiatus explained not only by her illness which continued throughout this period ( Letters III.167, 170), but also by her need to devote energy to revising proofs for both Mrs. Dalloway and The Common Reader . Corrected proofs for the latter were sent to R. &amp; R. Clark on 18 March ( Diary III.5), and the Woolfs left for a ten-day vacation in France on 26 March ( Letters III.172). It is improbable that she would have taken this vacation if proofs for Mrs. Dalloway still remained to be corrected; thus, we may assume that by mid-March, final revises for A 1 and E 1 had been sent to New York and Edinburgh. 3 This schedule agrees with Woolf's plans to send her novel to Harcourt "about March," as she explained in her letter to Brace on 15 November 1924 (III.142). The hypothesis that R reflects a first-round of general revises would account for the discrepancy in the number and extent of corrections between this set and the American proofs (Apr). Indeed, Apr shows hundreds of changes Raverat never saw, many of them minor revises in punctuation, capitalization, word-choice, and sentence structure. Curiously enough, however, Woolf did not hesitate occasionally to insert punctuation or change a capital on Raverat's set as well. Whereas she began corrections for the first editions as early as page 15, no changes were made on R until page 91. Here, revises agree in four instances, but Apr 91 includes an additional six revises—deletions, insertions, alterations in capitalization—which do not appear on R. Although it is possible that Woolf selected certain revises for Raverat and omitted others, or that she was haphazard in her corrections, these discrepancies are better explained as changes made for A 1 and E 1 after mid-February. This hypothesis is further supported by the change at R 248.17 where Woolf altered an upper-case "H" to lower case, just as she did on the other two proofsets. This is the only alteration in R between pages 225 and 271, although some forty revises occur in the same section of Apr, including two punctuation revises in the same line as the altered "H". It is unreasonable to suppose that she would alter one capital letter in the space of forty-six pages of R, omitting all the intervening substantive changes she made for A 1 and E 1 rather, we can assume that these revises represent changes made after mid-February. A similar argument can be made for her failing to correct a typographical error at R 260.6 where "her" appears for "he", thus rendering the sentence meaningless; likewise, at R 239.18 "nake" appears for "make"; both errors were corrected on Apr, and E 1 gives the correct reading, evidence that suggests Woolf caught the errors on a second reading. Although the Raverat proofs contain revises made early in the proof-correcting process, and although they are in no way as complete as those for the American edition, their importance is by no means diminished. They provide valuable evidence about Woolf's proof-correcting and the order in which these corrections were made; furthermore, the Raverat proofs help to clarify Woolf's intentions where her revises for A 1 and E 1 are ambiguous or missing. In collating the proofsets to determine a sequence of corrections, certain hypotheses need to be set forth about the transcription process. Despite the tangles of the evidence, it is possible to unravel some of the strands if the following five principles about Mrs. Dalloway are accepted: 1. The sequence of correcting proofs and transcribing revises from one set to the other two cannot be determined when all three agree in their readings. 2. Where a discrepancy occurs in the revises, the variance is attributable to one of five mutually exclusive causes: (I) transcription error; (II) authorial oversight; (III) intentional omission; (IV) intentional inclusion; or (V) subsequent revision after one or more proofsets were mailed. These categories are mutually exclusive, but of course it is not always possible to identify each variant as belonging to one or another type. 3. Variants of the first two types (transcription errors and those due to authorial oversight), however, are usually identifiable and can be used to determine a probable transcription order; that is, a transcription error occurring on only one of the three proofsets indicates that that proofset was corrected last in the process. (Because proofs for E 1 are not extant, conjectures must be made about revises by comparing the uncorrected Apr with E 1 , although some variants inevitably were introduced by the Hogarth printer.) Transcription errors, where Woolf miscopied emendations from one proofset to another, can usually be distinguished from those cases of authorial oversight where she simply overlooked her corrections in the transcription process. 4. Variants of the third and fourth types (intentional omissions and inclusions) apply only to the Raverat proofs since there is no cogent reason why Woolf would have sought to produce two different first editions, one British and one American. 5. Variants of the fifth type, those due to subsequent revision, however, account for the large number of discrepancies between the two first editions as well as for many of those between R and Apr. Some three-quarters of the R revises agree with those of Apr as well as with readings in E 1 ; thus, we can assume that Woolf made the same corrections on the proofs from which E 1 was set. In these instances no order of transcription can be determined. An interesting case occurs, however, at R 141.24 where Woolf inserted "she", then deleted the word, recognizing that she had intended the clause "she said, arranging the roses" three lines later at 141.27. This deletion represents a transcription error which Woolf caught, and it indicates that R was second or third in the transcription sequence, at least at this point. Apr, on the other hand, shows that Woolf emended the passage to read "she said, arranging the flowers"; then she deleted "flowers" and interlined "roses" above, in agreement with E 1 . Whether Apr was first or second to be corrected cannot be determined in this instance, but it does appear that here Woolf was transcribing her revises onto R from one of the other two sets. Correcting three sets of proof simultaneously becomes exceedingly tedious. Given that Woolf was not temperamentally suited to this kind of work and that she still felt the effects of influenza, it is not surprising to find many transcription errors on the proofs. Because these errors can exist side by side with variants of Types II-V, some rationale has to be offered for distinguishing one from another. This rationale rests on the assumption that Woolf was intent upon correcting the Raverat proofs as quickly as possible, a job she finished in mid-February; subsequent revising was then done on the other two proofsets before mid-March. In her article on the American edition of Mrs. Dalloway , E. F. Shields argues that Woolf continued revising the Hogarth proofs without informing Harcourt of her changes; later, however, Shields proposes that independent readings of both proofsets may have taken place (158, 173-174n). Ample evidence exists that Woolf continued revising the Hogarth proofs after she mailed the other two sets, but many of the variants Shields cites (159ff.) can be attributed to transcription errors, authorial oversights, or unclear directions which Hogarth and Harcourt printers interpreted differently. Contemplating the burden of correcting three sets of proof, an author might spread out all three sets, read and correct one, transferring each correction as it is made to the other two sets. What this method gains in accuracy and consistency, however, it loses in speed and continuity. Although simultaneous transcription was used occasionally, it is more likely that Woolf corrected one set of proofs at a stint, then used it in transcribing revises. In the next stint she might well have picked up another proofset to correct first. It is reasonable to assume that she read Mrs. Dalloway proofs sequentially, in order of the sections or "chapters," as opposed to the order followed in correcting proofs for The Common Reader , a group of essays which could be corrected in any order. When she marked a new section at Apr 89.19/20, she found a good stopping point; and on continuing her work, she began correcting the Raverat set in addition to the other two. The fact that no revises appear in R until page 91 indicates that she did intend to leave this set "uncorrected," as she says in her letter of 5 February; but whether from error or from recognition that extensive changes were necessary on all proofsets, at this point she began correcting all three. Revises in R tend to occur in clusters within the last seven sections of the novel. As Shields points out (169-171), there are several discrepancies between A 1 and E 1 in the number of sections, so some clarification is necessary. Because of poor printing procedures at Harcourt where the printer left a "blank" line at the bottom margin, the reader of A 1 must count lines on pages 124 and 228 to determine that a space occurs and a new section begins. In two other instances (Apr 142.21/22 and 281.6/7), Woolf failed to instruct the Harcourt printer where to divide the text, although she did mark the divisions for E 1 and in one case (281.6/7) for Raverat. Since this visual device would not be significant for Raverat, we can assume that at R 281, Woolf either confused his set with Apr, or that she forgot to make the same change. Her error or oversight has been perpetuated for all American readers of the novel since 1925. 4 The following table sets forth these discrepancies between the corrected proofs and the first editions of Mrs. Dalloway : Structural Divisions in Mrs. Dalloway American Proofs (Apr) Raverat Proofs (R) Harcourt (A 1 ) Hogarth (E 1 ) 23.4 23.4 19.13 23.4 45.11 45.11 42.13 45.11 74.11 74.11 72.9 74.11 86.23 86.23 85.4 86.23 89.19/20 (89.19/20) 88.3 89.20 99.8/9 (99.8/9) 97.18 99.7-8 125.26/27 (125.26/27) * 124.26 125.27 (142.21/22) (142.21/22) [142.5/6] 142.22 227.15/16 (227.15/16) * 228.26 227.15 248.12 248.12 250.19 248.12 (281.6/7) 281.6/7 [284.4/5] 281.5-6 The first four entries in this table show where blank lines occur on the proofs, indicating five of the novel's divisions. Because they occur in proof, we can surmise that Woolf indicated them on her typescript prepared in December 1924. Line numbers separated by a slash show where Woolf drew horizontal lines to instruct her printers at Harcourt and Hogarth to leave blank lines, as at Apr 89.19/20. Page references within parentheses indicate those instances in which Woolf failed to specify a break in the text; thus, she made no such mark on Raverat's proofs at 89.19/20. Although she did indicate a break in his text at 281.6/7, she failed to make the same correction on Apr. Square brackets around a page reference indicate where structural breaks should occur in A 1 , but do not. As can be seen from the table, E 1 provides eleven divisions for twelve sections, whereas A 1 shows only seven divisions clearly. The two entries marked by asterisks identify those places in A 1 where the blank line Woolf requested on Apr is the last line in the printed text. Although the division at R 281.6/7 is attributable to Woolf's error, that at E 1 142.22 is problematic. To account for it, we must assume either that Woolf forgot to make the transcription from the Hogarth proofs to the American proofs, or that this break represents yet a later revision made after the American proofs were mailed to New York. Because the first two editions agree in other substantive changes made on page 142, the latter hypothesis is more compelling. For purposes of the present argument, however, it is important to establish only the following points: (1) that Woolf sought to use the visual device of the blank line to separate the structural units of her novel; (2) that the proofs allow us to determine when certain changes were made; (3) that the divisions in the text would have provided natural resting points in the proof-correcting process; and (4) that Woolf saw no need to indicate these divisions to Raverat since she knew the novel would be read to him. This argument assumes, then, that ten of the eleven divisions were determined by mid-February and that the division at 142.22 was made late, probably after mid-March. Evidence for this chronology is admittedly scanty, but the hypothesis gains support from other substantive variants between A 1 (where it agrees with Apr) and E 1 . In addition, all the structural divisions Woolf added occur in the last two-thirds of the novel, except for the division at A 1 250.19 which had already been determined in the typescript. Since all of the Raverat revises also occur in the last two-thirds of the novel, it is reasonable to conclude that Woolf devoted most, if not all, of her attention in the first round of correcting to this portion of the novel. This would help explain why most of the R revises tend to occur in clusters within the last seven of the novel's twelve divisions. Having established the location of these divisions, we may now turn to a closer examination of the R revises. Appendix I lists these in sequence by page and line number of the Raverat proofs, followed by corresponding references to the first American (Harcourt) edition. Since pagination in E 1 follows closely that of the original proofs, references to that text are omitted. Using any reprint of A 1 , a reader can determine both the reading of the proofsheets and Woolf's revises for Raverat. Many discrepancies in proofsheet revises can be classified according to the five types outlined above: (I) transcription error, (II) authorial oversight, (III) intentional omission, (IV) intentional inclusion, and (V) subsequent revision after one or more proofsets were mailed. Although not all variants can be absolutely identified in this classification, the value for editorial proceedings is obvious. Because variants of all five types can exist side by side, the clearest and most revealing presentation is to examine these clusters of R revises, with attention to the most significant ones, as they occur within the structural divisions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sections I-V (7.1-89.19; A 1 3.1-88.3) As indicated above, Woolf did not begin her revises for Raverat until page 91, whereas she undertook revision for A 1 and E 1 as early as page 15. In this segment of A 1 she emended some 50 passages on 37 pages of proof, making minor changes in punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and phrasing —many, but not all of which, agree with E 1 readings. These Apr revises are, then, Type III or Type V emendations. As most of them are minor, it is possible that she simply decided not to include them on Raverat's proofset. But it is also possible that all were made after mid-February. At R 33.12, for instance, a blank of about eight spaces occurs either because the Hogarth printer could not read Woolf's typescript or because the typescript itself lacked a word; Woolf corrected the passage for both first editions, adding the word "purity" (A 1 30.5), but Raverat had to fill in the blank on his own. Given the statement in the letter of 5 February that Raverat's set was to be left "uncorrected," the simplest hypothesis is that most of the 50 Apr revises in Sections I-V belong to the third type of variants, those intentionally omitted from Raverat's set.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section VI (89.20-99.8; A 1 88.4-97.17) At Apr 89.19/20, Woolf divided her text and began the sixth section as Peter Walsh awakes from his nap in Regent's Park. Page 90 of the American proofs shows only minor revises (the deletion of two parentheses, an alteration in capitalization, and the insertion of the word "and"). Page 91, however, is heavily revised, and it is here that Woolf began correcting Raverat's set in addition to the other two, perhaps because she recognized that the revises were becoming so numerous or because she momentarily confused R with Apr. In Section VI a cluster of R revises occurs between pages 91 and 95, four of which are transcribed incorrectly. The first passage emended for Raverat, in fact, is one of the most interesting for what it reveals about Woolf's proof-reading. Here, Peter Walsh recalls Clarissa Dalloway in a socially awkward moment at Bourton in the 1890s: Proof ( without correction ): He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing. It was her manner; her timid hardness; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish. Raverat proof (emended) : He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing. but it was her manner that annoyed him; her timid; hard; arrogant; unimaginative; prudish. American proof (emended) : He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing but It was her manner that annoyed him; timid; hardness; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish. E 1 91.1-4 : He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing, but it was her manner that annoyed him; timid; hard; arrogant; prudish. This passage contains revises of Types I and II where transcription errors and authorial oversights are clearly evident, and it suggests not only that the Hogarth proofs were the first to be corrected in this instance, but also that Woolf continued correcting this set later. For Apr she overlooked two deletions she had made for Hogarth: the final "-ness" of "hardness" and the alteration of the capital "I" of "It" to lower case. On its own authority, the Harcourt edition silently corrected these errors to preserve parallel stucture in the sentence (A 1 89.11-15). Had Woolf been transcribing from either Apr or R, it is unlikely that she would have made the right correction for E 1 . The failure to delete "unimaginative" in Apr can be an authorial oversight (Type II), or its deletion in E 1 can be seen as a subsequent revision (Type V), but either way we should consider the Hogarth edition as having the more reliable reading for this passage. The botched emendation renders the passage senseless in the Raverat text, ungrammatical in the Harcourt edition, but correct and readable in the Hogarth. At Apr 93.7, Woolf changed the upper case "O" of "Old" to lower case, making a slash through the capital and writing "l.c." in the right margin. Since E 1 supplies the same reading, we can assume that she made the change on the Hogarth proofs as well. For Raverat, she simply drew the slash through the upper case "O" and wrote "o" in the margin, in accordance with her practice not to use proofreader's symbols on his set. Thus in all cases the texts agree here that Peter Walsh goes in to dinner and sits beside "old Miss Parry." Two pages later, however, the following changes are made: Original proofs and E 1 95.22-24 : "Don't you want to go with them?" said Aunt Helena—poor old lady!—she had guessed. Raverat 95.20-21 : "Don't you want to go with them?" said Aunt Helena—poor Miss Parry!—she had guessed. Apr 95.20-21 and A 1 94.7-8 : "Don't you want to go with them?" said Aunt Helena—old Miss Parry!—she had guessed. On the basis of the change at 93.7, it could be argued that the Harcourt edition provides a more reliable reading than the Hogarth in this instance. The failure of E 1 to include the change has several possible explanations: (1) Woolf forgot to make the change on the Hogarth proofs; (2) she made the change for Hogarth, but the printer overlooked her revision; (3) she made the correction for Hogarth, but on a subsequent reading decided to retain the original phrasing. Without the Hogarth proofs, it is impossible to determine the intended reading of this passage where variants of all five types may well exist side by side. Given the accuracy of the Hogarth printer (based on a collation of Apr and E 1 ), the second option above has the least to recommend it. The third possible explanation is more speculative, but there are several instances in Apr where Woolf emended a passage only to write "stet" in the margin to signal retention of the original phrasing. If this is an authorial oversight (Type II) where Woolf forgot to make the correction for E 1 which she had made for A 1 , then the various revises suggest Woolf's carelessness and confusion in trying to work with three sets of proof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section VII (99.9-(125.26); A 1 97.19-* 124.26) As the narrative point of view shifts from Peter's to Lucrezia Warren Smith's, Woolf marked a structural break at Apr 99.8/9, neglecting to make the same change for Raverat. Although no changes occur in this section of R, she did emend twenty-five passages in Apr, where we find revises in punctuation (14), simple deletions (5), insertions (6), and substitutions (9). These include six significant alterations on page 103 alone, none of which appear in R. This evidence suggests that most of these revises belong to Type V. (A collation of this section in E 1 and A 1 reveals 37 punctuation variants in passages where A 1 agrees with Apr and with R. Since these represent additions to or deletions from the already set British proofs, they must have been made on a subsequent reading of the Hogarth proofset.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section VIII (125.27-[142.21]; A 1 125.1-[142.5]) Section VIII is dominated by, but not exclusively restricted to the viewpoint of Septimus Smith, the paranoid young man whose insanity and suicide occupy half of the novel's thematic interest. For the Raverat proofs, Woolf emended nine passages on pages 128, 129, 132, 134, and 141, all of which could have been accomplished in one stint. In addition to these revises, she continued making alterations (Types III and V) for A 1 and E 1 ; the American proofs, for example, show changes in punctuation (10), capitalization (3), deletions (4), insertions (6), and substitutions (4). These revisions do not affect appreciably the characterization of Septimus Smith or the depiction of madness, but they do affect the stylistic presentation, and they do suggest the degree of Woolf's attentiveness to details. However careful Woolf might have been, the tedium of correcting three sets of proof did produce numerous transcription errors. In addition to the example cited above from R 141.24, two other instances merit attention. Uncorrected, proof page 134 read: Rezia "could remember hearing how wonderful the shops were, from an Aunt who had lived in Soho." Woolf emended the sentence for the published editions by inserting "married and" after "had"; on the Raverat proofs, however, she misplaced the insertion after "who". Had the Raverat set been corrected first, this reading would likely have been transferred to the published editions. As this is a Type I revision, we can assume that the Raverat set was second or, more likely, third to be corrected in this stint. After this transcription error, the next R change does not occur until seven pages later, where Woolf made another error, but this time on Apr. The original proof reading (141.10-11) gave: "It was at that moment (Rezia had left) the great revelation took place." The substitution "gone shopping" is made on all three proofsets, but only on the Raverat and the Hogarth proofs did Woolf correctly delete the participle "left"; for the American edition she incorrectly crossed through the verb phrase "had left" and thus produced the reading "(Rezia gone shopping)" that has appeared in every American copy of the novel since 1925 (A 1 140.18; A 2 93.6).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section IX (142.22-227.15; A 1 [142.6]-228.25) Occupying almost a quarter of the novel, Section IX begins at noon as Septimus and his wife visit Sir William Bradshaw, roundly criticized for his unsympathetic diagnosis of Septimus's illness and for his prescription of rest and a "sense of proportion." The section contains as well a mildly satirical portrait of Lady Bruton who entertains Richard Dalloway at luncheon, and a condemning portrait of Miss Kilman who accompanies Elizabeth Dalloway shopping. It concludes about 6 P.M. with Dr. Holmes's visit to Septimus, who in a gesture of confusion and defiance hurls himself from the window— the climactic scene which Woolf sought to underscore by directing her American and British printers on page 227 to leave two blank lines. For Raverat she made no such revision. Other changes made for Apr in this section are minor stylistic ones, occurring on nearly every page of the 85-page segment, but none of which appear on Raverat's set: revises in punctuation (29), capitalization (5), deletions (17), insertions (20), substitutions (18), spelling changes (7), and syntax (3); in addition, she indicated on page 209 that two paragraphs were to be run together, another alteration she failed to make for Raverat. Since this section was too long to be corrected in one stint, it is likely that Woolf read quickly over the whole, making occasional revises, until she arrived at the climactic scene, finding the final paragraphs unsuitable. Although the stylistic revises on Apr belong to Type III or, more probably, Type V, the typescript revision of the suicide scene inserted between pages 224 and 225 was almost certainly done at Monks House before 10 February. A transcription of the typescript revision for Raverat's set is provided in Appendix II. Although hastily prepared and not carefully proofread, this single-spaced typescript probably served as copy for the similar typescripts inserted in the Hogarth and Harcourt proofsets. The left margin of the Raverat insertion is skewed; one sentence is heavily erased, almost illegible; and there are obvious typographical errors (e.g., "opeining" for "opening"; "throwin" for "throwing"; "stair case" for "staircase") which are corrected in the double-spaced typescript inserted in the Harcourt proofs. 5 The typescript revision borrows liberally from an earlier passage (A 1 139-140) which did not undergo any revision at the proof-reading stage, and Woolf continued to tinker with the passage after proofsets for Raverat and Harcourt were mailed, deleting the second half of the question, "Only human beings—what did they want of one?" The Hogarth edition (E 1 225.12) prints: "Only human beings?" Although other variants between the proofsets and the published editions are less substantive for this depiction of suicide, the main point for this study is that the Raverat proofs allow the dating of this typescript revision to be placed at 6-10 February. A collation of the proofs and the first editions suggests further that in this case the Hogarth edition reflects Woolf's later changes. Section IX contains twelve other passages which Woolf emended on Raverat's set, and two of these represent unique readings unavailable in either of the printed editions. Four others are correctly transcribed from the other proofsets, whereas the remaining six revises appear to be Type I changes, transcription errors, or Type II changes, authorial oversights. Furthermore, these revises cluster in what must have been short proofreading stints: four occur between pages 149 and 155; three, between pages 198 and 201; and three, between pages 220 and 224. No changes appear on R between pages 155 and 198—a lengthy section where Woolf made numerous changes on the other two proofsets—except for the two revised passages representing unique readings to the Raverat proofs. Both of these revises are made in pencil. The alterations at R 175.4 and R 184.10-11 are problematic in that they are the only changes in pencil on the Raverat proofs, and there are no corresponding changes made for Apr. 6 That they are in pencil and that they occur relatively close to each other would suggest that they were made at the same reading of the Raverat proofs, a reading undertaken independently of those for the published editions. If Woolf rushed through Section IX in order to provide Raverat a more polished version of Septimus's suicide scene, then it is possible that she read this forty-page segment and made only two changes at the time. Returning later to the Harcourt and Hogarth proofsets, she made full revises for them (Type V). The alteration at R 175.4 shows clearly that Woolf intended to delete the semicolon after "miracle" rather than merely the top half of the punctuation mark: a slash is drawn through the entire mark, with the abbreviation "d/" pencilled in the right margin, her characteristic symbol for deletion. Although the semicolon is not altered at Apr 175.4, the American printer nevertheless deleted it—a fortuitous error which produces the sentence Woolf probably intended. 7 The first Hogarth edition, on the other hand, prints "miracle," which would suggest that Woolf may have made an alteration on the Hogarth proofs similar to the one she made for Raverat, but that the British printer misinterpreted her directions and deleted only the top half of the mark. In this case the alteration at R 175.4 represents the most reliable reading in the proof corrections, and we can conclude that the omission of this revision in Apr is an authorial oversight. The hypothesis that Woolf intentionally omitted all the other revises made for Apr between pages 155 and 198 and included for Raverat only the one change in a punctuation mark makes her appear more haphazard and idiosyncratic than she was. Rather, it is more plausible that these Apr revises were made after mid-February. The second pencilled revision occurs at R 184.10-11 where Woolf inserted the word "could" and altered "understood" to "understand" to produce the following passage in which Clarissa Dalloway imagines asking Peter Walsh (italics mine): What's your love? she might say to him. And she knew his answer; how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman could possibly underst and it. Very well. But could any man understand what she meant either? about life? If Woolf pencilled in this change only on the Raverat set as she read quickly through this portion of Section IX, it is not unlikely that she overlooked it later when she took up her pen to correct the other two proofsets. In context, the reading provided by R is superior to that in the two first editions, not only because it is consistent with the verb tense of the subsequent sentence, but also because it is more appropriate to the character of Peter Walsh. The omission of this revision for both A 1 and E 1 appears, then, to be another authorial oversight (Type II). As in the previous case (R 175.4), the Raverat proofs here present the preferred reading. In addition to these cases of authorial oversight, instances of transcription errors occur in Section IX. Attempting to account for the variants produced by these errors, E. F. Shields cites two cases and argues that E 1 produced variants which are "perhaps the result of changes which Virginia Woolf made for the Hogarth edition on the final proof-sheets" (160). Shields did not have access to the Raverat proofs, and thus her argument cannot account for existing evidence: it now becomes clear that many of the variants between E 1 and A 1 resulted from Woolf's transcription errors. Thus at R 198.12-13, Woolf inserted the phrase "made one feel so small" after deleting "was quite different from any one she knew." The same change was made on Apr, but not apparently for E 1 which reproduces both the original verb phrase and the inserted revision (198.11-13): Miss Kilman was quite different from any one she knew; she made one feel so small. Similarly, at R 200.9-10, the insertion "she said" was probably intended for the Hogarth printer, but Woolf confused the proofsets and made the change for Raverat instead. In both cases the transcription errors indicate that the Hogarth proofs were, in this stint, last in the series to be corrected, and further, that the Harcourt readings are more reliable in these instances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section X (227.16-248.12; A 1 229.1-250.18) In this section Woolf made no changes on the Raverat proofs whereas she altered twenty passages in the corresponding section of Apr. Again, these are minor stylistic revises: insertions of words or punctuation (12), deletions (7), substitutions (9), altered capitalization (3), and the correction of the typographical error at 239.18. Since there is no cogent argument to explain why Woolf would have intentionally retained a typographical error on Raverat's proofset, we can conclude that this revision was made after mid-February. This is likely to be the case with the other changes made for Apr in this section.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section XI (248.13-281.6; A 1 250.20-[284.4]) The Raverat revises in Section XI cluster between pages 271 and 281, with only one alteration in capitalization made at R 248.17. The Harcourt proofs, on the other hand, show fifteen altered passages between pages 248 and 271, further evidence that Woolf continued correcting that set after she mailed the Raverat proofs. More significant are the revises unique to the Raverat proofset: Apr reading with Woolf's changes . . . closeness drew apart; rapture faded, one was alone. (A 1 281.2-3) Revisions made only on R . . . closeness draws apart; rapture fades, one is alone. (R 278.3-4) . . . revive, send roaring up that immeasurable delight, rubbing stick to stick, one thing with another, she must have perished. But that young man had killed himself. (A 1 282.1-4) . . . revive [∧] send roaring up that insolence [∧] that levity [∧] that immeasurable delight, rubbing stick to stick, one thing with another—she must have perished. She escaped. But that young man had killed himself. (R 279.2-5) She had wanted success. Lady Bexborough and the rest of it. (A 1 282.10-11) She had wanted success,—Lady Bexborough and the rest of it. (R 279.13-15) The last of these three passages contains merely a punctuation variant resulting from a transcription error when Woolf confused the Harcourt and the Raverat proofs. The Hogarth edition omits the dash Woolf inserted at R 279.14, but does show the comma she inserted after "success". (No alterations were made in this passage on Apr. The dash could have been added on the Hogarth proofs, then deleted later; or Woolf simply could have made a transcription error here. Cf. E 1 279.11-13.) It was generally her practice to use the dash without the preceding comma, although instances where both marks appear together can be found in A 1 which in all cases follows Apr: 8.8, 24.26, 69.22, 77.22, 109.1, 117.21, 119.21, 140.6, 198.18, and 206.15. Variants between E 1 and A 1 occur in three of these cases (109.1, 117.21, and 206.15) where E 1 deletes the comma before the dash, presumably at Woolf's instructions on a later reading of the Hogarth proofs. Available evidence thus points to Woolf's inconsistency and suggests that, at times, she failed to attend carefully to punctuation. That she included this revision on Raverat's set, but made no changes on Apr, marks another instance where she confused the proofsets, intending to make the punctuation change for the Harcourt edition. The addition of the words "insolence [∧] that levity [∧] that" at R 279.2 may represent a revision that Woolf wrote out hastily, omitting the commas, but then rejected for the published editions; or it could represent an authorial oversight, if at this point she was transcribing her revises from R to the other two proofsets. In the absence of the Hogarth proofs, it is necessary to resort to an argument based on context. The R addition alters appreciably the character of Clarissa Dalloway in ways for which the novel itself offers little justification. Although she admits that she can be petty, envious, ambitious, and easily irritated, Clarissa is hardly insolent or contemptuously rude. Having flouted some social proprieties in her youth, as a mature woman she is the epitome of civility. If the R addition represents merely a momentary experiment with a new phrase, then Woolf's rejection of it for E 1 and A 1 could be seen as her attempt to maintain this consistency of character. The alteration at R 278.3-4, like that at R 279.2, can be considered an initial revision rejected later in favor of the original: after all, the shift in tenses produced by the revision is an error Woolf rarely committed. Or the failure to include this alteration for the published editions can be attributed to authorial oversight: the R changes are not made in the margins of the proofpage, but interlined or written over the original letters; thus, they could have been easily overlooked in transcription. A third possibility, however improbable, is that these are Type IV revisions, changes Woolf intentionally included for Raverat but not for the published editions. Her awareness that Raverat's death was near might have stayed her hand in deleting these revises or might have encouraged her to alter the phrasing to render it more immediate, more poignant. Since editorial decisions based on R readings alone are tenuous, it is best to consider the changes at R 278.3-4 as rejected revises and to follow the phrasing of the published editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Section XII (281.7-293.14; A 1 [284.5]-296.20) The horizontal line Woolf drew between lines 6 and 7 on page 281 of the Raverat proofs clearly delineated the final section for him, but never for the American readers of the novel for whom the mark was no doubt intended. Nine pages later she made one minor revision, the only change in this final section of the Raverat proofs. Here the reference is to Sally Seton (R 290. 18-21): Despairing of human relationships (people were so difficult), she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women would never give her. Both the Harcourt edition (following Apr) and the Hogarth edition agree in their readings: "a peace which men and women never gave her" (A 1 293.26-294.1; E 1 290.21). Unique to the Raverat proofs, this revision reflects either an authorial oversight or a change later rejected for the published texts. In context, the revised passage presents a more cynical view of Sally Seton; and again, consistency of characterization would argue for retention of the original passage. In this last section of Apr, Woolf made two minor deletions on pages 283 and 293, and added the words "great grandfather" at 283.20 which produced an ambiguous sentence in A 1 (286.17-20): "And Sally used to be in rags and tatters. She had pawned her grandmother's ring which Marie Antoinette had given her great-grandfather to come to Bourton." As Shields points out (162), E 1 follows a different set of revises here, attributing the ring to Sally's great-grandfather, omitting the reference to the grandmother, and making it clear that Sally, not Marie Antoinette, had come to Bourton. These revises were probably made after mid-February, and the one change at R 290.18-21 was most likely overlooked as Woolf hurried to complete the revisions for Raverat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion This argument assumes that Woolf read quickly through the proofs of Mrs. Dalloway while she was at Monks House, 6-10 February 1925, making over 50 revises on the proofsheets for Raverat, including the substitution of a 200-word paragraph at page 225. Several long segments of the novel, most noticeably pages 7-90 and pages 155-198, are left virtually uncorrected in R, but not in the other two proofsets. The clustering of R revises further suggests that these proofs were read sequentially in brief stints, corresponding roughly to the twelve sections of the novel as represented correctly in the first Hogarth edition. Variants between the extant proofsets and between the two first editions are attributable largely to transcription errors, to authorial oversights, and to subsequent revisions after Woolf mailed proofs to Raverat and to Harcourt, although some revises were intentionally omitted (or perhaps included) for Raverat. At times Woolf could be attentive to minute details in phrasing and punctuation; at others she could be haphazard and careless. Correcting proof is always a tedious business, and Woolf's work was made more difficult by having to work under the pressure of self-imposed deadlines and during an illness. Since the Raverat proofs were the first to be mailed, and since Woolf must have returned to the other two sets for further corrections, the Raverat set might be considered merely a literary curiosity. It is more than this, however, because it offers valuable evidence about Woolf's correcting and revising her novel, and it allows the dating of certain of her emendations. Most significant, the Raverat proofs help clarify many of Woolf's revises for the Hogarth and Harcourt editions; thus, no editor or careful reader of Mrs. Dalloway could afford to ignore this proofset.

For clarity, two methods of recording are used. An asterisk marks the beginning of a revision, and the bracketed material describes the alteration from the original proof reading to the Raverat proofs. (A double asterisk indicates an intervening revision.) Notes indicated by superscript letters record variants between R and the Harcourt proofs (Apr), the first Harcourt (A 1 ) and the first Hogarth (E 1 ) editions. A wavy line [˜] indicates the same word appears in the text cited. No attempt is made to preserve Woolf's spacing or strikeovers on the typescript inserted in the Raverat proofset.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Permission to publish this account of the proofs is gratefully acknowledged courtesy of Quentin Bell, Virginia Woolf's nephew, as well as the Lilly Library, Indiana University, and the Library of the University of California at Los Angeles. 1 In a letter of 2 September 1982 Rita Spurdle of the Rights Department at the Hogarth Press informs me that many of the early Hogarth records were destroyed in World War II and that there is no correspondence at Hogarth between Woolf and her printers at R. &amp; R. Clark regarding the proofs of Mrs. Dalloway . 2 For this collation I have used copies of the first American edition (A 1 ) in the Rare Books Department, Perkins Library, Duke University, and in the Manuscripts Department, Lilly Library, Indiana University. Copies of the first Hogarth edition (E 1 ) were checked in the Rare Books Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in the Boston Public Library. For descriptions of the various editions, excluding the second American edition (A 2 ), see B. J. Kirkpatrick, A Bibliography of Virginia Woolf (24-29). 3 An entry for printing and binding copies of Mrs. Dalloway appears for 28 March 1925 in an R. &amp; R. Clark account book, now at the National Library of Scotland. This entry cannot be taken as evidence, however, for receipt of corrected proofs, despite the fact that there is a charge made for "Alt[eration]s and proofs." Nor does it suggest that Woolf was sent second proofs to correct. She did receive word from New York that the corrected first proofs (provided by Hogarth) had been received, and she wrote in her diary on 19 April that Harcourt thought the novel was "wonderful" (III.9). No mention of second proofs is made in her letters and diary for this period, and because the first Harcourt edition follows so closely the corrected first proofs Woolf had sent, it is safe to conclude that after mid-March she made no further revises for that edition. Letter (16 September 1982) from I. G. Brown, Assistant Keeper, Department of MSS, National Library of Scotland. 4 Harcourt continues to issue Mrs. Dalloway in photo-offset reprints of A 1 (1925). A new second edition (A 2 ), re-set and published in 1981, fails to correct the error as well as the omission: cf. 94.3/4 and 186.26/27, where no divisions are indicated. 5 Woolf's typescript for the Harcourt proofs contains errors of its own—"spoilt" for "spoil"; "wiat" for "wait"—both of which are silently corrected by Harcourt (A 1 226.7, 18). Neither of these, however, appears in Shields' list (166), while the one change she does cite from this revised passage—"Holmes and Bradshaw like that sort of thing."—is obviously a printer's error where "like" appears for "liked" (Apr reading). Thus, this is not one of Harcourt's "corrections" of Woolf's revised proofsheets, as Shields asserts (166). 6 Although all of Woolf's emendations on Apr appear in purple ink, there are pencilled corrections on Apr, all of which were made by a Harcourt editor. An unpublished letter (20 May 1925) from Alfred Brace to Roscoe Crosby Gaige explains that "the pencilled corrections are ours [i.e., Harcourt's], but the corrections in ink throughout are in the author's handwriting." In addition to galley marks and other directions to the Harcourt printer, the following pencilled changes occur on Apr: 'a' alt. to 'A' (71.1); hyphen insrt. aft. ' 2 great' (159.10); 'S' alt. to 's' (232.1). Moreover, at Apr 178.2, a circle is drawn in pencil around a quotation mark followed by a period, presumably so that the punctuation would be standardized, as indeed it was (A 1 178.7). The letter from Brace to Gaige is now at the Lilly Library, Indiana University. 7 No evidence in the form of second proofs or letters from Woolf to Harcourt is available to indicate that this change is anything but a printer's error or editorial emendation at Harcourt.

      <field name="heading_text">A New Manuscript of Poe's "For Annie" by J. Albert Robbins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A previously unknown Poe letter and manuscript of a major poem has recently been acquired by the Lilly Library of Indiana University. It exists because a Presbyterian minister in Saratoga Springs, New York, admired Poe and early in 1849 requested an autograph poem. Poe found the request "flattering" and responded with his recent 102-line poem, "For Annie," copied out in his neat, decorative hand. At some time, on or before 1887, this manuscript passed—perhaps as a gift—from the Rev. Anson Gleason Chester (1827-1911) to E. Kirke Hart (1841-1893), businessman, Congressman, leading citizen, and autograph collector of Albion, in western New York. We have a detailed description of Hart's autographs because on April 2, 1887, the Post-Express in nearby Rochester published a lengthy interview and description of the collection. There were signatures of local politicians of very limited reputation; but many names are still famous today: Theodore Roosevelt, Sam Houston, General William T. Sherman, Samuel F. B. Morse, John C. Calhoun, Horace Greeley, and P. T. Barnum. There were autographs of writers great and small: J. Fenimore Cooper, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Charles F. Browne (Artemus Ward), Benjamin P. Shillaber, William Cullen Bryant, Henry W. Longfellow, Rufus W. Griswold, Alfred B. Street, Elizabeth F. Ellet—and Edgar Allan Poe. Though the Poe manuscript was fully described in the Rochester newspaper in 1887, its provenance remained unknown until recently, when the heirs of E. Kirke Hart offered the Poe piece for sale. The new manuscript is in excellent condition, showing few signs of handling or exposure to light. The two leaves, 25 cm by 20 cm, are wove paper, joined at the left edge by a paper hinge. In the upper left corner is an embossed stationer's seal, with an upper and a lower scroll framing the initials "p&amp;s". The verso of the second sheet, folded and sealed with wax, carries the address: A. G. Chester Esqre / Saratoga Springs, N.Y. In the lower left corner Poe wrote his initials, EAP. The postmark reads: NEW YORK / 2 / APR / 5 cnts. Heretofore, only one complete manuscript of "For Annie" was known—the one recently owned by Colonel Richard Gimbel and now in the Poe collection of the Free Library of Philadelphia. The Chester manuscript now gives us two. To the seven variant printed texts, we now, with the reproduction of the Chester manuscript in Studies in Bibliography , have eight on record. Before we examine the variants in the new Chester manuscript let us review the eight extant texts. 1 The inferred chronological sequence of composition is as follows: 1. The Flag of Our Union copy. Poem sold by Poe to the editor of this Boston weekly. Sent about March 20, 1849 or earlier. Ms. letter of transmittal and holograph poem lost. Published in the April 28 issue. Evidence is that the April 28 issue was distributed about April 21 or earlier. 2. The "Annie" copy. Private holograph copy of poem sent in letter dated March 23, 1849 to Mrs. Nancy Locke Richmond, the "Annie" of the poem. Ms. letter lost. (See Ostrom letter 309 for conjectural text of Poe's letter.) 2 Holograph poem in Free Library of Philadelphia is thought by some to be the copy sent to Mrs. Richmond. Holograph poem reproduced (pp. 134-135) in John H. Ingram, "Variations in Edgar Poe's Poetry," Bibliophile (London), 2 (May, 1909), 128-136. 3. The Chester copy. Private holograph copy of poem sent to Rev. A. G. Chester, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in letter of April 1, 1849. Letter and holograph poem now in the Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington. 4. The Home Journal copy. Holograph poem enclosed in letter to N. P. Willis, editor of the Home Journal (New York), dated April 20, 1849 (Ostrom 310). Published in issue of April 28. The first printing is that in the Flag of Our Union , although that printing and this in the Home Journal were in issues dated April 28. The Flag published consistently earlier than the printed date of the paper. Only 52 lines of the holograph poem survive (present location unknown to me). A note in the margin signed "N. P. W." establishes this as the ms. sent to the Home Journal . Holograph poem sold at auction of the library of Fred W. Allsopp (Parke-Bernet Galleries, Feb. 4, 1947). Text available in Selected Writings of Edgar Allan Poe , ed. David Galloway (Harmondsworth, Eng.: Penguin Books, 1967), pp. 84-87. 5. The Spectator copy. Copy (probably a clipping) enclosed in letter dated May 23, 1849, to Edward H. N. Patterson, proprietor of the Oquawka Spectator (Oquawka, Ill.). Ms. (or clipping) lost. Poem published in issue dated May 16. 6. The Examiner copy. Proof sheet, with revisions, for Richmond (Va.) Examiner , made September 1849, but not published. Text available in James H. Whitty, ed., The Complete Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (Boston, 1911), pp. 76-77. 7. The Poets and Poetry copy. In a letter to Rufus W. Griswold in May 1849 (Ostrom 317), Poe wrote, "I enclose perfect copies of the lines 'For Annie' and 'Annabel Lee' . . ." Griswold included "For Annie" in the 10th edition of his The Poets and Poetry of America (Philadelphia, 1850 [actually 1849]), p. 422. Holograph poem lost. 8. The Works copy. Publication in The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe , edited by Griswold (2 vols., 1850-56), II, 48-51. The date of volume II is 1850. In order to highlight successive alterations and make it easy to follow Poe's revisions, I have keyed all variants to the first ( Flag of Our Union ) text. The Flag text is photographically reproduced in John W. Robertson, A Bibliography of the Writings of Edgar A. Poe (2 vols., San Francisco: Russian Hill Private Press, 1934), II, 273.

The varying texts all retain the original stanza structure (ten stanzas of 6 lines, four of 8 lines and one of 10 lines), giving a total of 102 lines. As the collation shows, there is much tinkering with accidentals and some, of no great consequence, with substantives. The principal revision, as noted in the collation, is, commencing with the Chester copy, the reversal of stanzas 4 and 5—a reversal retained in all subsequent texts. In the eight texts there are twenty-four substantive variants—none of them greatly different in meaning, tone, or imagery. Most of them are substitution of a close synonym (italics mine): fountain changed to spring , happily to tranquilly , for example. The most substantial, in the final stanza, is fire to thought to light . A few changes substitute plural for singular ( river to rivers , pansies to pansy ). A few word shifts seem to indicate change in meaning ( glory to Passion , love to truth ), but if viewed in context, they seem not so much shifts in meaning as experimenting with loosely synonymous conceptual terms. Occasionally the emendations verge on the trivial, as when in line 29 the expletives in the eight texts are successively O, oh, ah, ah [no comma], ah [no comma], Ah [no comma], ah [no comma], and ah [comma]. Not one of these changes affects meaning or tone. Of the eight texts, when we examine the record of emendations of substantives, it is the "Annie" copy (text 2) which has the most (nine) substantive revisions. In second rank is the Chester text (text 3) with five substantive word revisions and the unique reordering of stanzas 4 and 5. In only two instances are there substantive emendations in the last four texts: the change of But to And in line 45 of text 6 and the change of a preposition ( of to in ) in texts 6 and 8. The seminal emendations come in texts 2 and 3. Texts 4 through 8 have no textual authority except for these changes of conjunction and preposition. There is a different profile of the eight texts when we consider metrical emendations, and here by metrical emendations I mean shifting words from one line to another. The collation shows that we have one instance of a shift made in text 2, plus two shifts made in text 2 and retained in text 3. Even more striking are metrical emendations initiated in text 4. One shift occurs in text 4 and no subsequent texts, but four shifts occur first in text 4 and are retained in subsequent texts (5, 6, 7, and 8). So many metrical emendations appearing first in the Home Journal text (text 4) surely are what Poe had in mind when he wrote to Mrs. Nancy Locke Richmond that "The [ Flag ] so misprinted them [the lines] that I was resolved to have a true copy" (Ostrom letter 311). As the collation shows, there is much tinkering with accidentals; some alteration of meter, chiefly by moving a word from one line to another; and some changes of substantives, principally adoption of synonyms. As examples of accidentals, note in line 51 that the infinitive to sleep, in texts 1 and 2, becomes to sleep , in texts, 3,6,8, and to sleep , in text 4-5,7. The first two lines of stanza 9 (below) show both accidentals and shifting meter: the commas come and go; and the word "here" moves from the second to the first and back to the second line of the stanza: Text 1 My tantalized spirit Here blandly reposes, Text 2 My tantalized spirit here Blandly reposes, Text 3 My tantalized spirit, here, Blandly reposes, Texts 4-8 My tantalized spirit Here blandly reposes, All in all, one must admit, these various emendations of word and of punctuation are hardly monumental. A study of emendations indicates another, but minor, pattern of changes. These are a shortening of the -ed suffix in seven past tense verbs: conquer'd , drown'd , kiss'd , caress'd , extinguish'd , cover'd , and pray'd . Poe was not given to this type of affectation and since they all occur in text 7 ( The Poets and Poetry of America , 10th edition, edited by Rufus W. Griswold) and since these verbs were all normalized in text 8 ( Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe , also edited by Griswold), we may conclude that it was either editorial policy in compiling that volume, or else was house styling of the publisher, Carey and Hart. It is very likely, it seems to me, that Poe had no chance to read proof of the Poets and Poetry text. Or if he did, he kept silent about such pointless contractions, for, since this printing was his first inclusion in Poets and Poetry he might have been reluctant to demand the resetting of these seven lines.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Sherwood Anderson: Additions to the Bibliography by Charles E. Modlin Hilbert H. Campbell Kenichi Takada</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Walter B. Rideout noted in 1969 that "a complete and accurate descriptive bibliography remains among the desiderata of [Sherwood] Anderson scholarship." 1 And such remains the case today, for the uncovering of material for a definitive Anderson bibliography has proceeded but slowly and in a somewhat fragmented way. Particularly elusive has been the establishment of the complete canon of Anderson's published writings. The first comprehensive bibliographies of Anderson's publications were Raymond D. Gozzi's Columbia thesis, "A Descriptive Bibliography of Sherwood Anderson's Contributions to Periodicals" (1947) 2 and Eugene P. Sheehy and Kenneth Lohf's Sherwood Anderson: A Bibliography (1960). These lists have been supplemented by additional references in later studies: Ray Lewis White's The Merrill Checklist of Sherwood Anderson (1969); Richard Colles Johnson's account of a 1969 Anderson exhibition at the Newberry Library; 3 the bibliography in William A. Sutton's The Road to Winesburg (1972); 4 and White's article, "Sherwood Anderson: Fugitive Pamphlets and Broadsides, 1918-1940" (1978). 5 As another step toward completion of the bibliography of Anderson's publications, we have compiled a list of 36 additional items published between 1916 and 1941: 1916? 1.

      <field name="heading_text">A Textual History of Wallace Stevens' Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise by Richard Alan Schwartz</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In July, 1916, Poetry Magazine published Wallace Stevens' short play, Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise . It was later reprinted in a collection of plays edited by Frank Shay and Pierre Loving entitled Fifty Contemporary One-Act Plays (Cincinnati: Steward and Kidd Co., 1920), and in Opus Posthumous by Wallace Stevens , edited by Samuel F. Morse (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1957). These seem to be the only occasions on which Three Travelers has appeared in print. Nonetheless, the play's textual history, especially its prepublication history, reveals useful information about Stevens' method of composition and about his reliance upon the literary judgment of Poetry's editor, Harriet Monroe. Two typescripts and the author's corrected galley proofs, as well as some of Stevens' correspondence with Monroe, are housed in the University of Chicago's Joseph Regenstein Library, Poetry Magazine 1912-36 Collection (Box 39, Folders 10 and 14). 1 One of the typescripts is free of proof-reading marks and other internal corrections. The other is heavily marked and corrected and was obviously used as the printer's copy. The typescript which is free of corrections has pica type on pages 1-14 and elite type on pages 15-18. Pages 1-14 of the printer's copy are in elite type, and pages 15-19 are in pica. All of the pages typed on an elite typewriter are approximately a quarter of an inch longer than those typed in pica. We may then conclude that there were originally two distinct typescripts—one which was typed on longer paper with an elite typewriter, and one typed on shorter paper with a pica typewriter. The elite page 15 is a continuation of the elite page 14, and the pica page 14 is continued on pica page 15. Furthermore, in the printer's copy, deletions had to be made on the bottom of page 14 (elite) and the top of page 15 (pica) to allow the passages to flow together meaningfully. Thus, it is apparent that pages 1-14 of the elite typescript and pages 15-19 of the pica typescript combined to form the printer's copy. The logical assumption would be that the pica typescript was the original and that the elite typescript was a revised version, most of which was accepted as printer's copy. However, external evidence shows that this is not the case. In his letter of May 29, 1916 to Monroe, Stevens discusses a new, revised version "which embodies at least some of the suggestions made by you and Mr. Michelson. I have eliminated the hanging body. On that point, it seems to me that the creaking of the limb of the tree was more likely than the body itself, which for the most part would have been concealed, to create ridicule." The hanging body and creaking limb appear in the initial stage directions in the elite typescript, but not in the pica typescript. In that letter he also mentions, "You will note that the negroes now have no speeches." On page 15 of the elite typescript the Second Negro twice asks, "Is that you, Anna?" This is the only occasion in either typescript on which either of the Negroes has any lines. In the pica typescript this speech is given to the Second Chinese. Furthermore, Stevens goes on to instruct Monroe, concerning the revised version, "If you prefer this form, use it. Or if you desire still further changes in it, let me know. Or, last of all, if you have doubts and think the original form the better of the two, again let me know. . . . personally, I like the new form." In a note at the bottom of his corrected galleys Stevens wrote that the play, "seems all right. My remark that I liked the second version was a fib designed to give you your choice. But I did rather like the green bandanna. The fuss made about the hanging body was proof of something or other. I have made note of Mr. Michelson's protest." [The bandanna appears only in the pica typescript, and where it appears in the printer's copy, Monroe eliminated it.] This note indicates that Monroe selected the original typescript on which to base the printer's copy, and the printer's copy is predominantly the elite typescript. Finally, there are notes, in Monroe's handwriting, in the margins of the elite typescript referring to particular lines which say "omitted in later version" (p. 7), "changed for the better" (pp. 14 and 15), and "This out in later version" (p. 17). With this evidence we must conclude that the elite typescript is the original and the pica version is the revised, but largely unused draft. Thus the elite typescript represents TS1 and the pica typescript TS2. In terms of Three Travelers' compositional history, then, TS2, except for its final five pages, is largely irrelevant. Thus, except for those instances where elements from TS2 appear in the conflated typescript, this paper will not be concerned with that version. We should note that Monroe was responsible for all the additions and deletions, and for the selective process concerning which materials from TS2 would or would not be incorporated into the conflated version, as well as for the very choice of which typescript would serve as the basis for the printer's copy. Stevens consented to most of these changes; those he disapproved, he changed in the galley proofs. So this Monroe-corrected-composite of TS1 and TS2 can be said to represent Stevens' final intention, except as amended in the galleys. Therefore, I would recommend that composite of pages 1-14 of TS1 and pages 15-19 of TS2, as corrected by Monroe, as the copytext for a critical edition of the play. For the sake of clarity, I shall refer to that composite as the conflated typescript (CT); by "printer's copy" I mean CT as corrected by Monroe. Besides using pages 15-19 of TS2 as the basis for the printer's copy, Monroe also incorporated particular words and lines, or pieces of information, which appear only in TS2. Likewise, she incorporated into CT particular materials from the rejected pages of TS1. Most of Monroe's changes seem designed to render the play more dramatic. This procedure may have been inspired by Stevens' May 29 letter stating, "I desire to have the play a play and not merely a poem, if possible." Most of the alterations involve stage directions, encouraging gestures or limited movements. A few are directions specifying the emotions a speaker is to exhibit. There is one significant change taken from TS2. On page 2 of CT the three Chinese are first described. In TS1 the descriptions are very brief and limited to the Chinese's physical appearances. In CT, though, Monroe has added other details from TS2 that reveal something about their personalities as well. The First Chinese is not only short and fat, he is also "quizzical". The second is additionally described as "a man of sense and sympathy", and the third is "intent" and "detached". This additional characterization is useful because it helps the reader and the actor further grasp the exact nature of each of these individuals. Had Stevens intended the play to be "about" these people it would seem that these statements should be unnecessary, that a good playwright would show us that the characters posses these attributes, and not have to tell us. Stevens accomplishes this to a certain extent; but without these explicit adjectives it is difficult to be too precise about the Chinese, especially the First Chinese. Three Travelers is not essentially a play about characters though. It is designed to demonstrate a concept, and the characters are agents toward that end. In his May 29 letter Stevens says, "The point of the play, by the way is . . . in the last sentence of the final speech. . . . The play is simply intended to demonstrate that just as objects in nature affect us . . . so, on the other hand, we affect objects in nature, by projecting our moods, emotions, etc." The sooner Stevens can have us understand what the characters' personalities are like, the sooner he can employ them toward his artistic goal. Thus the decision simply to state, rather than show, what these characters' personalities are is not an artistic flaw; instead, it accentuates the artistic intention. Furthermore, in incorporating the additional information into CT, Monroe is more efficient than Stevens. In TS2, after describing the First Chinese as short, fat, and middle aged, Stevens introduces a new sentence, "He has a quizzical but not too broad manner." Monroe converts that into a single adjective, "quizzical", and inserts it into the previous sentence. Thus she makes the text a bit more concise and smoothly flowing, without deleting important information or otherwise detracting from the aesthetic effort. This is typical of her treatment of many of the insertions from TS2 into CT. The question naturally arises why Monroe selected pages 15-19 of TS2 as the basis of her preferred text, instead of using the entire TS1. Again, she seems to have been acting with Stevens' intentions very much in mind. In his May 29 letter Stevens discusses the revised typescript: "The most important change has been in the climax. This is still lacking in shading away. To some extent, this is intentional, because I do not desire to become involved in the story or characters of the man and the girl." Apparently, then, Stevens was concerned about the play's conclusion and these specific comments imply that he believed the ending in TS2 was, indeed, superior. Monroe's selection of those later pages of TS2 for CT reflect Stevens' feelings on this point. A significant difference between the endings of TS1 and TS2 might also have encouraged Monroe to choose the latter's. In CT, upon discovering the dead man but before finding Anna, the Second Chinese says, "Death, the hermit, needs no candle in his hermitage" and then snuffs out the candle while the First Chinese extinguishes the lanterns. This episode does not occur at all in TS1. The addition seems to reveal the Second Chinese's sensitivity, and the First Chinese's acquiesence to this notion shows that even he, the pragmatist, can respond appropriately to, and be affected by, this moment of humanity's invasion. Also, by having the speaker call death a hermit, Stevens highlights the parallel between the earlier conversations and the finale. The audience is virtually compelled by this personification to associate the ending with the earlier portions and to feel that they are bound up with each other. It seems, then, that Monroe's choice of text and her decisions to incorporate certain passages from the rejected pages of typescript are designed to advance the artistic ends that Stevens had in mind for his play. The cumulative effect of these decisions is to make the play slightly more dynamic, hence more appropriate to actual dramatic presentation; and to organize the parts of the work more efficiently for accomplishing Stevens' stated artistic goals. Monroe, however, not only edited and made decisions of artistic selection from the two typescripts, she also occasionally made changes and additions which were entirely of her own creation—not taken from earlier or later typescripts as Stevens had written them. These become particularly interesting because they represent passages which, although approved by the author, are nonetheless not of his own invention. Most of Monroe's changes do not affect the play's meaning or emotional impact. Instead, they are designed to make Stevens' stage directions more concise, precise, and explicit. Often the changes involve taking two of Stevens' sentences and fusing them into one, complex sentence. For example, in TS1, 3.23-24, Stevens writes, "He finds a book in the pocket of his costume. He reads." Monroe changes this to, "He finds a book in the pocket of his costume and reads from it." The effect of such changes is to make the prose read more smoothly. As a matter of editorial style, Monroe consistently italicized stage directions, changed Stevens' parentheses into brackets, and spelled out the numbers identifying the speakers. Thus Stevens' "(1st Chinese)" appears as "[ First Chinese ]" in the printer's copy. Stevens tended to be very fond of commas and he frequently overpunctuated. Monroe deleted much of his extraneous punctuation, and in only five or six cases in the galley proofs did Stevens indicate he wanted the punctuation re-inserted. In a note at the end of the galleys Stevens mentions that he has no copy of the play: obviously, then, he was not correcting the proof against his manuscript. Those cases where he reinstated his original punctuation must then have seemed especially "right" to him. In lines 5.11, 5.23, and 9.12 of TS1 Stevens had commas after the words: "reality", "moments", and "says" respectively. Monroe deleted them while preparing TS1 as the printer's copy, but Stevens restored the punctuation in the galleys. However, no printed version of the play contains it. So apparently the author's expressed intention was subverted in regard to these accidentals. There are other instances in the galleys where Stevens reverted to his original punctuation and those revisions were honored. Stevens was sometimes vague in his stage directions and would say "a negro" instead of First or Second Negro. Monroe clarified these situations. On one instance, TS1 14.15-17, Stevens confused the Negro who was the servant to the Chinese with the one who had been searching for the Italian man. Monroe corrected this also. She further deleted some stage directions indicating pauses or extra, superfluous action. The primary effect of these alterations is also to make the text read somewhat smoother. There are a few instances, however, where Monroe's alterations do substantially affect on the play's overall aesthetic sensibility. Apparently it was at her suggestion and Max Michelson's that Stevens omitted the hanging body in setting the initial stage when he wrote TS2. Instead, the Negro raises his lantern and sees a green handkerchief on the rocks. "The light of his lantern falls on the face of a man. The negro lifts the head slightly and looks at the face. He covers the face again with the handkerchief." Yet Monroe apparently judged this rendition of the scene to be inadequate; so she revised TS1 1.11-13 from "His [the Negro's] lantern light falls on the body of a man hanging to the limb of one of the trees. Only the back of the body is to be seen" to the version in the printer's copy: "Discerning a dark object swaying among the branches, he [the Negro] shrinks back." In both TS1 and TS2 Stevens informs the audience that there is a dead man on stage. This creates dramatic irony—the audience is aware of the body and anticipates its discovery by the characters. In the printer's copy, however, Monroe's change leaves the audience unaware that the man is dead until the characters receive that knowledge—the revelation is thus a shared one; there is no dramatic irony. In a very direct and important way, then, this detail determines the nature of the audience's experience with the play. A viewer's or reader's emotional response is vastly different if he knows beforehand what is to happen. And the discoveries of the body and the girl are the most important dramatic moments of the play, when "the invasion of humanity" reaches the Chinese. One reason that Stevens originally may have chosen to make the audience aware of the dead man from the beginning is that such dramatic irony would cause the audience immediately, instead of retrospectively, to associate the Chinese's early discussions of the beauty of the court and humanity's invasion of it with their own situation. Because this parallel provides the play's most important metaphor, we can understand why Stevens would wish to accentuate it. On the other hand, in depriving the audience of the foreknowledge, Stevens and Monroe enhance the play's dramatic power. In the revised version, the audience is in suspense over the outcome of the First Chinese's tale about the sweaty Italian tragedian who ran away with his neighbor's daughter. The periodic creakings of the limb and the troubled expression of the Negroes are, in this case, ominous, but not obvious. Indeed, in the earlier version, they could very possibly have provoked ridicule, as Stevens feared they might. Furthermore, in the printer's copy the audience experiences something of its own invasion of humanity, and this serves to bring home Stevens' point more effectively than dramatic irony allows. The audience members not only intellectually accept the thesis; they feel it too. For these reasons the decision to eliminate the foreknowledge of the hanged man seems to have been a good one. Certainly, whether good or bad, it is crucial in determining the nature of our emotional experience with the play. Stevens, however, did not appear to be aware of the importance of this decision. His remark on the galleys that the "fuss made about the hanging body was proof of something or other" seems to indicate that he did not think the issue was especially serious, and his only comment on it in his May 29 letter deals with the more superficial issue of the creaking limb. In his May 29 letter Stevens suggests that more shading is necessary for the play's conclusion and he states that, "Possibly further thought might lead to something in the speech commencing, One candle replaces | Another, etc." In TS2 he had already added three more lines, causing that speech to read: One candle replaces Another, Re-coloring, As they move. That is for you. (TS2, 16.28-17.4) The "you" here is Anna, and the speaker refers to the sunrise replacing the candle. Monroe rejected this addition, crossing out those last three lines in the printer's copy. It is difficult to speculate exactly why she did so, but the effect of her decision is to leave the observation universal, instead of specific. The addition, "That is for you" focuses meaning onto Anna. Its omission allows the passage to serve as a general observation on the way of things in nature. The two lines "Re-coloring, | As they move" are appropriate to the thesis of the play, and it is somewhat surprising that they were deleted. There is another significant element from TS2 that Monroe did not incorporate into the printer's copy. At the bottom of the last galley sheet Stevens said that his earlier remark that he preferred the second version was "a fib designed to give you your choice. But I did rather like the green bandanna." This is the green handkerchief with which the First Negro covers the dead man's face in TS2. In that typescript the Second Negro removes it when they discover the body, and during the Third Chinese's concluding soliloquy the Second Negro spreads it over the dead man's face again. Stevens may have liked the bandanna in TS2 because it frames the action: in that version the play begins and ends with a Negro spreading it over the dead man's face. Thus, the play is bounded by the audience's awareness of the presence of death—the ultimate form of humanity's invasion. Monroe probably deleted the bandanna because in CT, which rejects the beginning of TS2, the man is never cut down from the tree; he is still hanging from it when the curtain falls. This situation makes it either impossible or ludicrous for anyone to cover the corpse's face. After Monroe completed her revisions to produce the printer's copy, she sent the galley proofs to Stevens for corrections. In an amusing note on the first page she said that she had been correcting the galleys between speeches at the Republican convention, "A delicate 'incongruity'!" To which Stevens replied on the last page, "I think the Republicans are wasting their time in holding a convention." She requested that he be as sparing of changes as possible, within reason. But she did make a few suggestions, most of which Stevens accepted. She recommended that in the initial stage setting, in which there is a dark object "swaying among the branches" (1.10), that "swaying" be eliminated as too definite. Stevens agreed, and it was deleted. One of the revisions Monroe had made in CT was a sentence in which a Chinese enters carrying a Chinese lantern (1.18). Stevens wrote a note on the galleys making it clear that the lantern was not a Chinese lantern, and this too was deleted. In another note he objected strongly to the use of the term "exits" (1.12) and changed the reading from "exits through the wood at the left" to "enters the wood to the left." Interestingly though, in all the printed forms this passage reads, "goes out through the woods to the left." Stevens also stated, "For the sake of consistency say ' to the right' ' to the left' all throughout, instead of ' to the right' in one place and ' at the right' in another." In CT the First Chinese tells Anna's story to his fellows stating "Amusingly" that it was not an elopement (10.26). In the galleys Monroe suggested changing this to "Amusedly" and Stevens agreed. A printer's error changed a line describing Anna, her father, and the Italian as "Three beggars . . . begging from one another" (15.4,5) to "Three beggars . . . begging for one another." Stevens remarked on the galleys that " For instead of from is a most fortunate change," and he retained the inadvertent correction [italics mine]. Also, in CT the Second Chinese first sees the girl and says, "Anna." (16.3, 16.7). In the galleys Monroe suggested changing this to "Is that you Anna?" and Stevens concurred. This is actually the same wording that appears in TS1, when the Second Negro discovers her and asks the question. Finally, in a note on the galley sheet Monroe questioned how one can strike an instrument in an insinuating manner (11.21). Stephen replied, "Please do not change. This may be a heathen mystery but I believe it." The insinuating manner was retained. Variations between the galleys and the way the play appears in its first American publication in Poetry (A1) are not significant. All of these have already been discussed, except for one accidental. There are, however, some interesting differences between the Poetry version and the way the play appears in Fifty Contemporary One-Act Plays (A2). Prefacing the play in A2 is a note which states that it has been reprinted from Poetry Magazine . However, there are variations in house styles, as well as accidental and substantive changes. There is no reason to believe that Stevens approved of these changes. In CT, as well as in A1, the opening stage directions are in italics but are not bracketed. In A2 they are both italicized and bracketed. In A1 the character speaking is indicated by italics; whereas in A2 this is done with bold print. In CT and in A1 all stage directions appear within brackets, the first letter of the first word is always capitalized, and there is a period which always falls inside of the brackets. A2 sometimes follows this format, but it often, and for no apparent reason, begins the first words with lower case letters and places the periods outside the brackets. These examples account for most of the accidental differences, but there are two substantives. In CT (10.21) and A1 the Second Chinese speaks to the First Chinese about the elopement, "Confidingly." This appears as "Confidently" in A2. More importantly, in the printer's copy (16.18) and A1 the First Chinese tells the Second Negro to bring fresh water. In A2 he tells the Second Chinese to bring it. This is confusing to the reader, who must wonder why one Chinese has commanded another, and why the second one has apparently simply ignored that order. The third American edition of the play (A3) appears in Opus Posthumous . This is closer to the A1 version, differing only in the matter of house style and one accidental. The A3 consistently uses bold print instead of italics to designate the speaker, and it consistently uses lower case and no punctuation for stage directions that are not complete sentences. The accidental is the omission of a comma after the word "hill" corresponding to 11.1 in CT. Thus changes at every stage characterize the development of Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise from its original typescript form to its second and third American printings. Some changes were made by the author, some by Monroe with Stevens' approval, and a few by her without his approval. Some resulted from errors in the reprintings of A2 and A3 from A1. The most significant aspect of these changes is the authority Stevens freely gave to Monroe to select which typescript would serve as a basis for a printer's copy, to select which elements from the rejected typescripts she would incorporate into the printer's copy, and to delete passages from the printer's copy. Monroe seems to have employed this authority judiciously and with Stevens' stated intentions specifically in mind. The end result is an example of a profitable, cooperative relationship between an author and his editor.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The 1961 Andrés Bello Award: William Faulkner's Original Acceptance Speech by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three years after William Faulkner's death, Random House published in 1965 what was intended to be a complete compilation entitled Essays, Speeches, &amp; Public Letters by William Faulkner , edited by James B. Meriwether. However, the volume failed to include a formal acceptance speech Faulkner had delivered on Thursday morning, April 6, 1961, in Caracas, Venezuela: a three-paragraph address acknowledging receipt of the Order of Andrés Bello, that country's most prestigious civilian award. This omission would go unredressed until 1974 when two separate publications would attempt to complete the record. The first of these, appearing in March 1974, was Joseph Blotner's two-volume Faulkner: A Biography . In his chapter containing a detailed description of Faulkner's two-week sojourn in Venezuela in April 1961, and referring to Faulkner's receipt of the Order of Andrés Bello, Blotner recorded that as Faulkner "began to read from a sheet of paper, the audience listened intently. He was reading a Spanish translation of his one-page acceptance speech." 1 Without suggesting that the Spanish translation, its words, its phraseology, might have been attributable to anyone other than William Faulkner, Blotner concluded his account with a lengthy excerpt in English of Faulkner's climactic third paragraph, the origin of this English version not being identified. 2 For a reader to assume Faulkner's authorship of the Spanish translation might be only too plausible since Faulkner had made a similar gesture in New Orleans when he delivered, entirely in French, his acceptance speech in November 1951 on the occasion of receiving the Legion of Honor award. In thus himself penning his Legion of Honor speech directly into French, Faulkner not only bypassed the assistance of an intermediary, but, more significantly, had transmitted his thoughts originally and unalterably into foreign-language patterns of written speech. Indeed although only approximating competency in both written and spoken expression, Faulkner's command of French was far superior to that of Spanish for which he demonstrated no aptitude in written form and little more in verbal fluency. To accomplish in Caracas a result comparable to that he had effected in New Orleans, Faulkner actually required a translator to take his words from English into an equivalent Spanish text which might approximate his desired expressions and from which he might read in the native language of his presenters: the ultimate goodwill gesture. In August 1974, following Blotner's biography, James B. Meriwether added the complete English translation from the Spanish made by Muna Lee (from which Blotner had quoted 3 ) to an otherwise exclusive gathering of essays and articles previously published in Summer "Faulkner" numbers of the Mississippi Quarterly . This Faulkner Miscellany in fact printed on pp. 164-166 two distinct versions, one in Spanish and the other the Lee English version. The accompanying headnote included the following information, all that was known at the time: On April 6, 1961, in Caracas, William Faulkner received from the Venezuelan government the Order of Andres Bello, first class. He made his speech of acceptance in Spanish. It was published in the Caracas newspaper El Universal April 7, 1961, p. 5, and that text is reprinted here. 4 Faulkner's original English version has apparently disappeared, and who translated it into Spanish is not known. However, at a later date Miss Muna Lee, a Foreign Service officer who was also a poet, made a translation back into English, which is given here. Had it not been for the very recent recovery of Faulkner's original single-page holograph draft of his Andrés Bello Acceptance Speech, Faulkner's authentic words, specific turns of phrase, his measures, and sensibility itself would perhaps never have been known. While visiting Victoria Fielden Johnson, daughter of William and Victoria Franklin Fielden, Faulkner's son-in-law and step-daughter, his hosts on that 1961 trip to Caracas, Venezuela, I discovered among family effects various documents relating to that two-week period in Faulkner's life. 5 Of particular significance was a typed letter dated April 4, 1961, bearing the official seal of "The Foreign Service of the United States" on its letterhead. Written by Cultural Attaché Cecil L. Sanford to Faulkner, it accompanied a package delivered to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fielden where Faulkner was staying; the package, as the letter stated, contained various Faulkner titles in Spanish translation which the author might wish to present personally to Sr. Romulo Gallegos. On the verso of this letter was Faulkner's three-paragraph pencil holograph draft of the speech he subsequently delivered two days after the date affixed to the letter. From the six minor strikeovers and only one circled five-word phrase Faulkner had shifted slightly from the beginning of one to the end of a contiguous sentence, it would appear that the composition had given its author very little difficulty. A plausible conjecture might suggest that having written this brief piece, Faulkner easily could have dictated from this clean draft to his interpreter Hugh Jencks the contents of what would become a speech translated with relative literalness into Spanish. Likewise, in a matter of a half hour, Jencks could have retyped his Spanish transcription into ribbon and multiple carbon copies and handed them over to Faulkner for study. Indeed, Jencks also might have coached Faulkner in his pronunciation prior to making his Thursday morning speech at the Ministry of Education. Having delivered his speech in Spanish, Faulkner could have passed along to El Universal 's reporter in attendance for publication his own ribbon copy of the Spanish translation by Jencks from which he had just read. A carbon copy of this speech in Spanish was in the same group of effects containing the original Faulkner holograph, just one sheet below it in a massive stack of related documents. The first complete and accurately transcribed Spanish version of the typescript of the text Faulkner delivered in Caracas, Venezuela, on April 6, 1961, appears below. Following it, making its debut in its original English version, is William Faulkner's own acceptance speech for the Andrés Bello Award. 6 I have placed in square brackets and set off by the notation " del. " all words which Faulkner deleted in pencil by means of strikeovers. Fortunately, English-language readers need rely no longer on a twice-removed rendition of this speech; its recovery and present publication assure a reliable text, one which its author would have delivered had he chosen to do so in English. 7 El artista, quiéralo o no, descubre con el tiempo que ha llegado a dedicarse a seguir un solo camino, un solo objetivo, del cual no puede desviarse. Esto es: tiene que tratar por todos los medios y con todo el talento que tenga—su imaginación, su propia experiencia y sus poderes de observación—poner en una forma más duradera que su instante de vida frágil y efímero—en la pintura, la escultura, la música o en un libro—lo que él ha experimentado durante su breve período de existencia: la pasión y la experanza, lo bello, lo trágico, lo cómico del hombre débil y frágil, pero a la vez indómito; del hombre que lucha y sufre y triunfa en medio de los conflictos del corazón humano, de la condición humana. A él no le toca solucionar la disyuntiva ni espera sobrevivirla excepto en la forma y el significado—y las memorias que representan e invocan—del mármol, la tela, la música y las palabras ordenadas que, algún día, tendrá que dejar como su testimonio. Esta es, sin duda, su inmortalidad, tal vez la única que le sea concedida. Quizá el mismo impulso que le condujera a esa dedicación, no era más que el simple deseo de dejar grabadas en la puerta del olvido, por la cual todos tenemos que pasar algún día, las palabras "Lalo estuvo aquí". Así pues, estando yo aquí, en este día de hoy, siento como si hubiera ya tocado esa inmortalidad. Porque yo, un extraño aldeano que seguía en un lugar muy distante, esa dedicación, ese afán de intentar capturar y fijar así, por un momento en unas páginas, la verdad de la esperanza del hombre en el medio de las complejidades de su corazón, he recibido aquí en Venezuela la acolada que dice, en esencia: "Su dedicación no fué en vano. Lo que buscaba y encontró e intentó capturar fué la verdad". The artist, whether he would have chosen so or not, finds that he has [become del. ] been dedicated to a single course and one from which he will never escape. This is, he tries, with every means in his possession, his imagination, experience and observation, to put into some more durable form than his own fragile and ephemeral life—in paint or music or marble or the covers of a book—that which he has learned in his brief spell of breathing—the passion and hope, the beauty and horror and humor [, del. ] amid the conflicts of his own heart, in the human condition. He is not to solve this dilemma nor does he even hope to survive it save in the shape and significance, the memories of the marble and paint and music and ordered words which [to del. ] someday he must leave behind him. This of course is his immortality, perhaps the only one. Perhaps the very drive which has compelled him to that dedication was simply the desire to have [written del. ] inscribed beside that final door into oblivion through which he first must pass, the words 'Kilroy was here.' So, as I stand here today, I have already tasted that immortality. That I, a country-bred [w del. ] alien [from thousands of miles away del. ] who followed that dedication thousands of miles away, to seek and try to capture and imitate for a moment in a handful of printed pages, the truth of man's hope in the human dilemma, have received here in Venezuela the official accolade which (sic) says in effect—[Yes. What you del. ] Your [search del. ] dedication was not spent in vain. What you sought and found and tried to imitate, was truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The notes accompanying pages 1779-86 detailing Faulkner's Venezuelan trip in April 1961 appear on pages 213-214 of the Notes section of the second volume. Blotner cites "Charles Harner, American Embassy, Caracas, to Dept. of State, 27 Apr. 1961; Hugh Jencks, 'Report to the North American Association on the Visit of Mr. Faulkner'" as his sources for the description of events and the specific award ceremony. But he does not date the Jencks' report (it was May 10, 1961) and, as remarked below, he does not document the source of his quotation in English from the speech. 2 In the One-Volume Edition in 1984 of his more comprehensive Faulkner: A Biography Blotner condenses all reference to the speech in one sentence, without quotation: "After Faulkner read his short, graceful acceptance speech—in Spanish—he took from his buttonhole the prized rosette of the Legion of Honor and replaced it with that of the Order of Andrés Bello." 3 In a phone conversation I had with Joseph Blotner on 6/18/85 he very kindly confirmed that in October 1972 he had supplied Meriwether with a xerox copy of Muna Lee's two-page undated translation of Faulkner's Andrés Bello speech from the Spanish. He also quoted to me the following note Muna Lee had penned at the end of page 2 of her translation: "This is my attempted translation. It is wholly unauthorized: Mr. Faulkner never saw it. Perhaps Mrs. Faulkner and Mrs. Summers would be willing to go over it and give it his turn of phrase. If they would not be willing to do so, and disapprove its present form, please destroy it. M. L." 4 The reprint of the Spanish translation actually created some incorrect variations in punctuation, spelling, accent marks, and pronoun correspondence from the text as printed in El Universal ; more seriously, it allowed to go unrestored almost half of the penultimate sentence apparently dropped by the American typesetter. 5 I am indebted to Victoria Fielden Johnson for graciously welcoming me on my visit to her in Cape Coral, Florida, from May 20-24, 1985, and for letting me inspect and acquire various documents, letters, manuscripts, and photographs relating to William Faulkner and his family which formerly had belonged to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Fielden. 6 The important differences between the Faulkner holograph original and the Lee translation from the Spanish may be illustrated by quotation from Miss Lee's opening sentence versus Faulkner's: "The artist, whether or not he wishes it, discovers with the passage of time that he has come to pursue a single path, a single objective, from which he cannot deviate." Some of the differences derive, of course, as much from the Spanish version as from the translator, although these deviations account for very few of the major distortions attributable to Muna Lee's rendition. One such difference does occur, however, in the following version of Miss Lee's second paragraph: "This undoubtedly is his immortality; it may be, the only immortality that will be granted him. Perhaps the very impulse which led him to that dedication was nothing more than the single desire to leave carved upon the portal of forgetfulness through which all of us must some day pass [emphasis added] the words 'He passed this way.'" The phrase in italics represents a transposition from singular to plural pronouns committed by the original translator from English into Spanish, not the reverse as is generally the case in carrying across the relatively literal Spanish translation into English. The final sentence in Miss Lee's version goes, ". . . striving to capture and thus fix for a moment on some pages the truth of man's hope amidst the complexities of his heart, have received here in Venezuela the accolade which says in essence: 'What he sought and found and tried to capture was Truth.'" 7 I wish to acknowledge my appreciation to Jill Faulkner Summers for allowing me to make public the Spanish and English texts of Faulkner's acceptance speech and all other items in my Faulkner collection in intervening scholarly publications which call attention to the multi-volume series, Faulkner: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brodsky Collection , edited by Louis Daniel Brodsky and Robert W. Hamblin, and in which subsequently they will appear.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Tale of Two Printings: Don Quixote , Part II by R. M. Flores</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been tacitly accepted that all copies of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II (Juan de la Cuesta, Madrid, 1615) were made up with sheets belonging to the same printing. 1 This long held, though hitherto untested assumption is incorrect. A thorough collation of copies Serís 12 of the Hispanic Society of America and Arch.B.e 7/3 of the Bodleian Library reveals a substantial number of textual and typographical variants between these two copies. No two copies of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, are identical, of course, a few textual variants are the result of impromptu changes made by the pressmen during the printing process, but the great majority of textual and typographical differences one finds between most copies arose when types got damaged, displaced, or fell during the running off of the formes. 2 However, the textual variants with which I am concerned here do not fall into any of these categories, because they were not incurred accidentally, nor are they offhand corrections done in press. The majority of the variants listed in Table I are spelling variants, addition, deletion, or switching of words, and obvious typographical errors. The nature of the variants, and the fact that they are clustered together in only twenty-four pages (out of a total of five hundred eighty-four pages) belonging to exactly three full sheets of the job imply that two sets of these sheets must have been set and printed at different times. What in all probability happened is that when the Cuesta-men were gathering the various sheets that make up the copies of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, they found themselves missing some copies of the inner sheet of gathering A (A3-A6v), the inner sheet of gathering G (G3-G6v), and the outer sheet of gathering Q (Q1-Q2v and Q7-Q8v). Then, instead of disposing of several hundred sheets of paper which were already printed and folded (a complete copy of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, consists of seventy-three sheets), Cuesta must have decided to have the twenty-four pages re-set and the missing number of sheets run off to make up for the shortage; paper, rather than skilled labour, being the dearer part of most printing jobs during the hand-press period. We can confidently state, too, that pages A3-A6v, G3-G6v, Q1-Q2v, and Q7-Q8v of copy Serís 12 belong to the first printing of these sheets because their running titles are the same as those used throughout the first edition, and, hence, that the corresponding pages of copy Arch.B.e. 7/3, which have their own characteristic set of running titles, belong to the second printing. Furthermore, because seventeen errors which occur on the pages of copy Serís 12 recur on the re-set pages of copy Arch.B.e. 7/3 we can safely conclude that the compositors who re-set them must have used the printed pages rather than the authorial manuscript as printer's copy. 3 Table 1 shows the corrections made and the substantive changes introduced by the compositors of the re-set pages. Table 2 shows the distribution of accidentals (contractions, expansions, additions and deletions of hyphens, and displacements of line endings), including some punctuation changes not listed in Table 1 (changes from colon to semicolon, or viceversa, and from comma to colon or semicolon). Three spelling variants between copies Serís 12 and Arch.B.e 7/3, and one correction have not been listed in Table 1: Serís 12, "mãdo" (A3, 16), "ſe" (A5v, 10), " Quizà " (A6v, 24), and "tra |baſſe" (G5, 25-26); Arch.B.e 7/3, "mãdô", "ſê", " Quiza ", and "tra-|baſſe", because they are copy variants of the first printing (He53/16 and Harvard; "mãdô", "ſê", " Quiza ", and "tra-| baſſe"). The variant concerning the missing hyphen is unimportant for my purposes here, but the fact that the three spelling variants of the second printing coincide with the readings of the Yale and Harvard copies suggests that the state of the printer's copy used by the compositors of the re-set pages was similar to the state of the Yale and Harvard pages. Tables 1 and 2 have the twenty-four re-set pages already grouped into six distinct compositorial stints: A3, A3v, A6, and A6v; A4, A4v, A5, and A5v; G3, G3v, G6, and G6v; G4, G4v, G5, and G5v; Q1, Q1v, Q8, and Q8v; and Q2, Q2v, Q7, and Q7v. Below I explain how I arrived at this page distribution, but I found it convenient to separate the pages into compositorial stints here in order to make the orthographic preferences of the compositors who re-set them stand out, expediting the presentation of my theories concerning the division of labour. Firstly, it is necessary to keep in mind that the Cuesta-men who set the printer's copy used to re-set these twenty-four pages were compositors F (A3-A6v) and I (G3-G6v, Q1-Q2v and Q7-Q8v). 4 Then, knowing, as we now know, that compositor F had strong spelling and punctuation preferences, and given the large number of spelling variants introduced by the compositors who set the pages for the second printing of the inner sheet of gathering A (eighteen spelling variants in each group of pages), we can safely conclude that he is unlikely to have had any hand at re-setting these pages. He certainly did not re-set pages A3, A3v, A6, and A6v, because whoever re-set them capitalized the two occurrences of the word "andante" one finds in these pages (variants 17 and 22), a form which goes counter to the preferred spelling of compositor F. He was the only compositor of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, who set this word invariably with a lower-case initial. 5 Just as in this instance one dominant spelling variant has helped us clear compositor F of having re-set pages A3, A3v, A6, and A6v, two other dominant spellings point to the identity of the compositor who did, in all probability, re-set them. The only compositor of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, who seldom accentuated the preposition "a" or the disjunctive conjunction "o" was compositor I (variants 2, 8, 19, 23, 24, and 29; the only exception is variant 15, which is probably a foul-case error). 6 If we now compare the other spelling variants introduced in these four pages with the preferred spellings of compositor I, it comes as no surprise that most variants (variants 4, 12, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, and 27) correspond with the spellings of the majority of occurrences of these words as they appear in the gatherings of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, assigned to him. In fact, the only form not set by compositor I in the first edition, or by any other compositor, is the word "cerebro" which always occurs as "celebro". There is, however, one puzzling feature of the overall changes introduced in this first group of pages; the relatively small number of non-substantive variants made by the compositor of the re-set pages (see Table 2). One would expect a compositor re-setting pages originally set by a different workman to introduce far more than forty-one non-substantive variants in a four-page stint of Don Quixote . There is no contradiction in this fact, however. Of the ten Cuesta-men who worked on the first editions of Don Quixote compositor I was the workman whose punctuation habits were more inconsistent and unpredictable than those of any other compositor; and this lacking of punctuation preferences on the part of compositor I led him into accepting and retaining as a matter of course the punctuation marks set by the other compositors. We do not find this go-along attitude in the approach of the compositor who re-set pages A4, A4v, A5, and A5v. The workman who re-set these pages made one hundred fifty-five non-substantive changes, almost four times as many as compositor I made in the same number of pages. This discrepancy between the two groups of pages and the substantial number of non-substantive changes introduced automatically eliminates both compositor F and compositor I from having re-set pages A4 to A5v, especially because the majority of the spelling variants introduced in these pages do not correspond with the spelling preferences of either compositor. They correspond, instead, with those of compositor J. For example, the only occurrence of the construction "ê yo" in the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, appears in a gathering set by compositor J (signature M7, 17; cf. variants 35, 36, 37, 51, and 59). Also, of the five men who set type for this edition, compositor J was the workman who showed more consistency in accentuating some verbal forms (see variants 34, 43, 53, and 54; variant 42 is probably either a compositorial inconsistency or, more likely, a foul-case error). It is not too difficult to guess the identity of the compositor who re-set the next group of pages (G3, G3v, G6, and G6v). None of the other compositors but F would have changed the three occurrences of the word "Andante" that appear in these pages to "andante" (variants 89, 98, and 103; see above). It is doubtful, also, that any of the other workmen would have introduced so many spelling variants (thirty-three) in only four pages of text. Moreover, all the spelling variants correspond with the forms preferred by compositor F. 7 But of the six compositorial stints entered in the Tables, the fourth (G4, G4v, G5, and G5v) and the last stints (Q2, Q2v, Q7, and Q7v) are the least difficult to unravel. The total number of changes made in these eight pages is so small (one hundred two; including sixty-five accidentals and seventeen corrections!) and the spelling variants introduced so few (four!), that only the compositor who set these pages in the first place could be the workman who set them anew, e.g., compositor I. 8 Lastly, all textual evidence points to compositor J as the Cuesta-man who re-set pages Q1, Q1v, Q8, and Q8v. The overall nature and numbers of the punctuation changes made by the compositor of the re-set pages tally with those made by compositor J in pages A4 to A5v closely, even though these two groups of pages were originally set by two different compositors (see Table 2). The orthographic changes made from unaccented o's to accentuated forms (variants 127, 128, 129, 130, 135, 155, and 157) and from accentuated a's to unaccented forms (variants 44, 45, 46, 47, 132, and 133); the accentuation of future-tense forms (variants 134 and 137); the spelling of the word asolver with double s (variant 148; see "aſſoluerle", Don Quixote , Part II, Bb3, 1); the capitalization of the word "Norte" (variant 136; see Don Quixote , Part II, Gg4, 30); and the typographical change from the ending -ſſô to -ſsô (variant 140), are all spellings and setting habits characteristic of compositor J's. The only departure from his well-established, though not entirely consistent, spelling habits is the change from "Gouierno" to "gouierno" (variant 138). (No occurrence of the word "irreparable"—variant 131—appears in the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II.) Three compositors, then, re-set the pages of the second printing. Compositor I re-set pages A3, A3v, A6, A6v, G4-G5v, Q2, Q2v, Q7, and Q7v; compositor F re-set pages G3, G3v, G6, and G6v; and compositor J re-set pages A4-A5v, Q1, Q1v, Q8, and Q8v. Of the four copies of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, which I have examined (see footnote 2), only one has the re-set pages, copy Arch.B.e 7/3 of the Bodleian Library. In this copy alone I have found no sufficient typographical evidence to pinpoint the exact sequence in which the pages were re-set and the formes run off, but five typographical features give us a general, overall picture of what might have happened. 9 1. The running title used in one of the re-set pages, signature Q2, belongs to a set of running titles used in some of the other gatherings of the edition (see signatures Bb3, Ee4, Gg8, Ii6, Ll5, and Ll7). 2. A set of eight running titles was set up especially for the re-set pages, and was used in all six compositorial stints. The running titles appear as follows: (i) A3v, G5v, Q7v, (ii) A4, G6, Q8, (iii) A4v, G6v, Q8v, (iv) A5, G3, Q1, (v) A5v, G3v, Q1v, (vi) A6, G4, Q7, (vii) A6v, G4v, Q2v, and (viii) A3, G5 [?]. Some of the types used in the main sets of running titles were distributed and then re-used in some of the new running titles; for instance, the lower-case n used in the running title of signature Mm6v reappears in running title iv, the upper-case Q used in the running title of signature Mm1 reappears in running title vi. 3. The state of wear of running title i suggests that the first forme run off of the three which have this running title was the inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering G, then the inner forme of the outer sheet of gathering Q, and last the inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering A. 4. The compositorial stints do not correspond with the pages that make up formes, but rather with the pages that would appear either on the upper or lower half of the printed sheet. This distribution implies that three sheets of the first printing were cut in half and the half pages were then distributed amongst the compositors to be used as printer's copy. 5. Only pages G4-G5v were imposed with an upper margin of a similar width to that of the average margin used elsewhere in the book. The other five groups of re-set pages were imposed in the chase with narrower head spacing pieces, so that when the book is open, let us say at pages A2v and A3, the lines of page A2v (first printing) are not aligned with the corresponding lines of the opposite page (A3, second printing), the upper margin of page A2v being some 9.5 mm wider than that of page A3. Taken together, this typographical evidence suggests that the shortage was discovered shortly after the last formes of the edition had been run off, when the sheets had already been folded and were being gathered to make up the books. At least one running title from the original sets was still standing, but the majority had already been distributed because the compositors had to make up a new set, in which they re-used some of the types used in the old sets. The use of only one set of running titles for all the stints indicates that the pages were all part of one job. That is to say, the pages were re-set, and the formes were imposed and run off not as the individual shortages were discovered, but only after all the shortages had been accounted for. The compositors were given copy in a fashion intended to speed up the completion of formes. Two compositors setting type for one forme concurrently (compositor I was setting pages A3 and A6v probably at the same time that compositor J was setting pages A4v and A5 to complete the outer forme of the inner sheet of gathering A) would finish the four pages of a forme in half the time it would take one compositor to do the job alone setting by formes, which was the more common practice for re-setting at the Madrigal-Cuesta press. This distribution of pages indicates that the compositors wanted to have the formes ready for the pressmen one immediately after the other, probably because only a few copies of each sheet were needed and it did not take the pressmen long to run them off. The anomalous width of the upper margin of the majority of the re-set pages implies that the Cuesta-man who imposed these pages was not aware that compositors I and J had used wider spacing pieces throughout the other gatherings. Given that pages G4, G4v, G5, and G5v show an average upper margin, we can deduce that these pages were not only set, but also imposed by compositor I who used spacing pieces with the appropriate width. Compositor F, on the other hand, who had set only one gathering of the first edition (gathering A) and who might not have imposed even those pages himself, is likely to have assumed, incorrectly, that his coworkers were using narrower pieces and simply imposed his own pages with the wrong wooden furniture at their head. It is possible that when compositor F finished setting his stint (G3, G3v, G6, G6v), he imposed his pages in chases already containing those set by compositor I, which already had a head spacing piece in place. He might have then decided, or been asked, to take over the task of imposing the other formes himself, thus leaving compositors I and J to continue the setting of type without unnecessary interruptions. This theory would support my contention that the first forme run with running title i in it was the inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering G, and would explain (1) why two formes have two pages with narrower than average upper margins and two pages with margins of an average width, (2) why the other four formes were all imposed with only narrower than average head spacing pieces, and (3) why compositor F set only one stint of the job. The reconstruction of events I have just outlined, and the theories I have advanced seem to me a plausible interpretation of the meaning of the scant bibliographical evidence we have at our disposal in this instance. But whether or not they describe accurately what did indeed take place at the Madrigal-Cuesta press during the re-setting of these twenty-four pages from the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, has little bearing on the rest of the story. What is of the greatest importance is the fact that we have extant samples of the printer's copy used to re-set these pages, and, thus, that we can bear witness to the manner in which compositors F, I, and J approached their copy. The compositors corrected forty-five errors, true, but they missed seventeen other obvious errors (see footnote 3) which should have been set right. They also introduced one hundred thirty-four errors and non-authorial readings (thirty-three typographical errors, eighty-seven spelling variants, and fourteen alterations that affect the text), and made one hundred seventy-three important changes to the punctuation of their copy. The number and nature of the punctuation and substantive changes made by these three compositors may seem small and unimportant to cause much concern amongst specialists, but when the average number of changes per page (thirteen) is multiplied by the number of pages with text (six hundred fifty-eight) that make up the first editions of Don Quixote , Parts I and II, the apparently innocuous thirteen changes per page attain their true proportions in relation to what the compositors who set type for these editions must have done to the text of the authorial manuscript. Over eight thousand possible, important changes to the original text is not a number which could be dismissed lightly. Such a massive number of changes would distort the style, vocabulary, and spelling and punctuation characteristics of the printer's copy. It is becoming more and more evident that this is exactly what has happened in the case of Cervantes's works. We perceive Cervantes's style, vocabulary, and orthography only through the irregularities, imperfections, and impurities of the bottle-glass panels placed between us and Cervantes's writings by the compositors of the first editions of these works. One example: Vio dize la hiſtoria el roſtro meſmo, la miſma figura el meſmo aſpecto, la miſma fiſonomia, la meſma efigie, la peſpetiua meſma del Bachiller Sanſon Carraſco, (first printing, G3v, 23-26) Vio, dize la hiſtoria, el roſtro miſmo, la miſma figura, el miſmo aſpecto, la miſma fiſonomia, la miſma efigie, la perſpectiua miſma del Bachiller Sanſon Carraſco, (re-set pages, G3v, 23-26) The earlier version of this passage evinces a clearly stylistic purpose in the repetition and alternation of two phonetically different forms of the same word (meſmo/miſmo). After the ill-advised and insensitive regularization and modernization imposed by compositor F to his copy, nought is left of this delicate balance but the monotonous repetition of the same form. If the compositors made these sorts and this number of substantive changes to a perfectly legible copy, even though the text had already, no doubt, been put through a process of regularization and modernization by the compositors who set the pages of the first printing (compositors F! and I), and even though they had to make an effort to follow the text of the printer's copy closely because of the restrictions imposed on them by the line-by-line, page-by-page setting, one can only shudder at the changes they must have made to the not-so-legible, not at all restrictive format of the authorial manuscript from which they set the first editions of Don Quixote . The tale these two printings tell is not a new one, nor does it have the sort of ending upon which one could build pleasant thoughts; but tales such as this one will never lose their fascination, because they are never identical, and their differences make the telling worthwhile.</field>

Copy Arch.B.e 7/3 also has the comma. 3 The incorrect readings occurring on both sets of pages are: "bueno," in lieu of bueno? (signature A4, line 14), "abraf | fadores" in lieu of abraſadores (A4, 22-23), "atado:" in lieu of atado? (A4, 29), "quien" in lieu of Quien (A5, 20), "Ceriongi | lio" in lieu of Cirongilio (A5, 25-26), "Cofmo | grafia." in lieu of Cosmografia?

Unless otherwise noted, all quotations are from copy Serís 12, references are by signature and line. 4 For an up-dated version of my theories regarding the distribution of labour in the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, and a comprehensive study of the orthographic preferences and setting habits of the eight Cuesta-men who worked on the first editions of Don Quixote , Parts I and II, see the introductory volume to my annotated, old-spelling edition of this work of Cervantes's, now in progress. 5 For the locations and numbers of occurrences of the word "andante" in all its forms (andante, andantes, Andante, Andantes) and of all the other words and derivatives referred to in this monograph see the Concordances to my old-spelling edition, Volumes 3 to 14. 6 Picking the wrong type was one of the most common errors compositors made while setting. This type of compositorial slip usually resulted in more than one typographical error, because the offending type was likely to be dropped in the wrong box during distribution, and, thus, would re-appear as a foul-case error later on (this could be what happened with variants 57→132 and 60→133). Similarly, when the accent or the tilde of a type broke during printing, the damaged type was frequently returned to its original box during distribution, even though it no longer belonged there, and would produce a "foul-case" error the next time around. It is virtually impossible to distinguish with all certainty between errors which are the result of a foul-case type, a compositorial slip, or a damaged type. I have designated them all as foul-case errors. We can be certain that nine per cent (twenty-one) of the variants listed in Table 1 are foul-case errors: variants 5, 9, 16, 18, 38, 40, 48, 63, 68, 78, 87, 96, 113, 116, 117, 119, 139, 143, 154, 172, and 179. 7 For variant 72 see The Compositors of the First and Second Madrid Editions of "Don Quixote", Part I , the Modern Humanities Research Association, London, 1975, Table 14, items 32 and 126, at pages 83 and 84. For variant 80 see The Compositors , Table 14, item 59, at page 83. For variant 66 see "aſſombradiza" and "aſſombrado" in Don Quixote , Part I, L1v, 28; Dd3v, 17; and Dd7, 9, all pages set by compositor F. For variants 95 and 106 see "embidia" and "embidiara" in Don Quixote , Part I, P5, 9; T5v, 21; Ll1, 19; and O6, 8, set also by compositor F. Compositor F changed one occurrence of the form "meſmo" to "miſmo" when he re-set some pages of the first edition of Part I, and when he was setting the first half of the second Madrid edition of Part I, he changed as many occurrences of the form "meſmo" to "miſmo" as he did of the form "miſmo" to "meſmo" (see The Compositors , Table 2, item 324, at page 33, and Table 14, items 112 and 113, at page 84), but his dominant spelling throughout Don Quixote was "miſmo'. For variants 61, 67, 71, 93, and 96 see The Compositors , Table 14, items 174 to 177, at page 84. For variants 62, 64, 69, 70, 81, 94, 97, 105, and 110 see The Compositors , Table 14, item 117, at page 84. 8 The insertion of sound n's (variants 112 and 118) is also characteristic of compositor I's spelling habits; see "inreparable", variant 131. 9 Following the nomenclature I have used in my previous monographs dealing with the printing of the first editions of Don Quixote , Part I, and Novelas ejemplares , I shall designate the copies made up entirely of sheets from the first printing as belonging to family group A of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II; copies having the three sheets of the second printing belong to family group B. For the identity of the compositors who set the first edition of Novelas ejemplares see my article "The Setting and Printing of the First Edition of Cervantes's Novelas ejemplares ", Studies in Bibliography , 37 (1984), 281-306.</field>
