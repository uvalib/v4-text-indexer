      <field name="heading_text">The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the principal problems with which descriptive bibliography has to contend arises from the fact that books are made up of smaller units, each with its own separate history. The book as a whole may be regarded as a unit by the bookseller or the book-buyer; but, as with other manufactured products, its component parts are the units at earlier stages of production. Variations can therefore easily occur among copies of what is supposed to be the same "book," as a result of differences in the manufacturing history of the component parts or differences in their placement in the finished product. Bibliographers have given a great deal of attention to this problem in connection with the letterpress sheets in books and have classified the variations that may occur into those that produce "issues" and those that produce "states." 1 Mixtures of sheets from different impressions or of gatherings with canceled and uncanceled leaves are difficulties that bibliographers are accustomed to thinking about in a formal way. Much less theoretical discussion has been devoted to the similar problems that are likely to occur when engravings, lithographs, and other materials produced separately from the letterpress sheets are intended to be bound with those sheets to form completed books. It is perhaps natural that variations among copies of the plates used to illustrate an edition of a work, or variations in the placing of those plates in different copies of the edition, have not generally been taken up in conjunction with variations in letterpress sheets. Inserted plates do seem to be further removed from the sheets than, say, a cancel leaf (or a whole cancel gathering) that was likewise printed separately from the rest of the sheets and inserted. One reason, of course, is that they normally result from a fundamentally different process of reproduction. When illustrations and text are produced by the same process—as when wood blocks are used with type (both relief processes)—there is no necessity for printing the illustrations separately and inserting them. But when, for example, engravings are to be combined with a text printed from type, the illustrations and text must be produced separately, since one results from an intaglio process and the other from relief. They would not only be printed on different kinds of presses but perhaps even in different printing shops and on different grades of paper. Furthermore, inserted plates, if their content is visual rather than verbal, represent not merely a different medium of reproduction from the text but a different medium of expression as well. They also often have a life independent of the text they are combined with in a particular edition. However, despite the natural tendency to think about inserted plates as a separate question from the complexities associated with the letterpress, it is important in a bibliographical context to see the plates as but another example of a larger problem: the potential for variation produced in books by the joining together of discrete elements, whether they are gatherings, cancels, plates, or publishers' casings. Plates may indeed have an independent existence and be treated by art historians as separate entities. But when they are included in books as part of the publisher's conception of what the books are to consist of, 2 bibliographical descriptions of those books must take them, and any variations associated with them, into account. In some books, of course, it is hardly appropriate to call the non-letterpress portions "insertions," for they may constitute the bulk of the books. A volume showing an artist's work in the form of engravings, or an atlas of engraved maps, or a tune-book of engraved music, for instance, might have a letterpress preface. Such books are likely to be discussed and described by art historians, cartographic historians, and musicologists, who bring to the task the traditions and vocabularies of their own fields, often derived from thinking about the engravings as separate pieces. That their language is sometimes different from that of bibliographers accustomed to dealing with printed books may be an inconvenience but is perhaps not a serious matter, since usually one can quickly learn to make the necessary adjustments. What is more important is that terminology reflects an underlying approach to the material; bibliographers and cartographers, for instance, may find themselves talking at cross purposes, even when they think they know how the other group uses certain words, because they may not share a single conceptual framework. There has in recent years been some discussion among both cartographers and musicologists about the classification and description of books in their fields, and there has been a somewhat longer tradition of concern with bibliographical description on the part of those concerned with illustrated botanical and zoological books. Illustrated books in general have always received a certain amount of attention, but I think it is fair to say, judging from booktrade activity and library exhibitions, that interest in them has never been higher than it is at present. The moment seems propitious, then, for encouraging interdisciplinary discussion of the problems of bibliographical description that are common to all books with plates. A consolidated approach will produce sounder advances and be of greater benefit to all who deal with books than a situation in which each field considers the problem independently. In this spirit, I should like to discuss what seem to me the two major questions: the first, more theoretical and conceptual, is what relation individual plates, with their own states and variations, have to the variant issues of the books in which they appear; the second, more methodological, is what considerations are involved in devising a system for recording the non-letterpress elements of a book in a bibliographical description. Much of what is said will have had its origin in thinking about books that join engravings and letterpress; but the principles involved ought to be applicable to any books that bring together materials produced by different graphic processes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In 1974 two works appeared that attempt to deal with the problems of bibliographical classification in cartography and musicology, and they can provide an instructive introduction not only to recent thinking in those fields but also to the nature of the difficulties such an undertaking entails. One is Coolie Verner's paper on "Carto-Bibliographical Description: The Analysis of Variants in Maps Printed from Copperplates," in the inaugural number of the American Cartographer (pp. 77-87); the other is the substantial volume that D. W. Krummel compiled for the International Association of Music Libraries, the Guide for Dating Early Published Music: A Manual of Bibliographical Practices . Both deserve credit for being pioneer efforts and for focusing attention within their fields on important but neglected questions; both also have short-comings, as their authors would no doubt agree, and a consideration of certain of those flaws can, I hope, serve a constructive purpose. I find that I must be rather harsh on Verner's piece; but it seems to have achieved considerable acceptance in its field—I have heard it referred to as "the McKerrow of carto-bibliography"—and a careful examination of it is therefore in order. 3 Verner, after explaining the kinds of events that occur in the history of individual plates of maps, concludes, "Terms used in descriptive bibliography [i.e., of letterpress books] are not applicable to cartobibliography because the precise conditions described by a term in the one are not found in the other" (p. 84). This statement, on the face of it, raises a number of problems. If indeed the "precise conditions" are so different, then of course different terms are desirable. But that observation hardly gets us very far. It is true that some terms used in the description of books have been employed with different meanings in the description of maps, and there is of course an awkwardness in such a situation. But to conclude that the same terminology will not fit both kinds of material is not a very productive solution: one of the goals of bibliographical description, as of other kinds of historical research, is to find connections, or patterns, or organizing principles, in the mass of surviving evidence. Even though letterpress is a relief process (or, in its more extended sense, a planographic one as well) and engraving an intaglio process, both involve presses of some sort and the transfer of inked images. It would seem profitable, therefore, to proceed from a premise of underlying similarity rather than to emphasize differences of detail. 4 For example, in his brief discussion of issue , Verner cites definitions by McKerrow and Bowers and then concludes, "In view of the precise meanings attached to the term issue in descriptive bibliography and its inappropriateness for carto-bibliography, this term should not be used in describing maps" (p. 86). Why it is inappropriate for cartobibliography is not analyzed; instead there is the flat statement that the "very specialized application" of the term to letterpress material has "no corollary in carto-bibliography." Although there has been some difference of opinion about exactly how issue should be employed in the description of books, the various definitions share a common theme: an issue is a publishing unit within an edition or a printing, and variant features that provide evidence of publishing or marketing decisions (such as a cancel title leaf with a different publisher's imprint or an inserted series designation) are determinants of issue. 5 In the case of an individual map, the substitution of one publisher's or bookseller's name for another by means of a paste-over cancel would create a different issue; and even if situations producing issues are not common in connection with the publication of separate maps, the possibility of such situations should surely be recognized in any theoretical framework for classification. Furthermore, when several engraved maps are fastened together as a unit, they become in effect a book, and the concept of issue is as relevant to such books as to letterpress books. Issue , of course, refers to whole entities as they are made available for sale, not to particular constituent parts of them, and engraved maps inserted into letterpress books may become elements in one or another issue of those books; indeed, their presence could conceivably be the factor determining issue, if copies of the letterpress sheets were also published without the maps. Although variants in individual maps are not necessarily involved here, the point is that the concept of issue cannot be regarded as irrelevant to the study of the way maps are published. The logic of Verner's discussion of edition is equally questionable, but his comments do serve to illustrate still more of the problems involved. Verner says that the definition of edition by McKerrow and Bowers, when applied to maps, would mean "all the impressions printed from a single plate" (p. 86). 6 Although "impressions" is used here in a different sense from its usual one in bibliography (here it means individual copies), the statement seems reasonable, since the engraved plate is the counterpart of the setting of type in letterpress printing. But Verner proceeds to say, "In this use of the term it is synonymous with the carto-bibliographical term plate and therefore redundant." After another sentence, he adds, "although the term edition is not functional in carto-bibliographical description and should be abandoned, it will continue to be used with reference to a given group of impressions [copies] of a map and must be defined precisely. An edition, then, as Skelton specifies, consists of all of the impressions of a map printed from any given state of a plate." A term that is "not functional in carto-bibliographical description" is thus recognized to have a function in describing "a given group of impressions of a map." One may well ask why the latter activity is not part of carto-bibliographical description; perhaps "description" here really means "cataloguing," although much of the discussion deals with relationships among copies and not with single copies in isolation. That difficulty, however, is only one of many raised by this passage. Another is the idea that edition is synonymous with "plate" and "therefore redundant." It is true that "plate" is often used to refer to individual finished products rather than to the copperplate itself: we speak of a letterpress book illustrated with "plates." In this sense all the "plates"—that is, all the copies of an engraving—produced from a single copperplate would be analogous to a letterpress edition (all the copies from a given setting of type). 7 But this use of "plate" is not what Verner has in mind. "In carto-bibliography," he says, "the term plate applies specifically to the wood block, copperplate, or lithographic stone used to print a given impression of a map" (p. 85). In that case it is difficult to see how "plate" renders the term edition redundant, for the former refers to a printing surface and the latter refers collectively to all the copies printed from a particular printing surface. Edition in letterpress terminology does not, after all, refer to type formes but to all the sheets of paper that have been printed from a given set of such formes. 8 Precision requires that the distinction between printing surfaces and printed copies be maintained in terminology. If "plate" were used for both purposes, the context would sometimes make clear what was meant, but in many cases confusion would be likely to result. Perhaps Verner intends to make a similar point when he admits that edition should be used "with reference to a given group of impressions of a map." But the definition he approves for this purpose creates further difficulties: "all of the impressions [copies] of a map printed from any given state of a plate." 9 The result of this definition would be that a single copperplate could result in more than one edition. Since edition has been more widely used for books than for engravings and since the meaning of the term in that connection is well established, it would seem to be foolish, when applying the term to engraved material, to support a usage that is not parallel to the usage for books. There is surely a convenience in having a term to refer to everything produced from a single plate, stone, setting of type, and so on, and edition would seem to be the clear-cut choice for this term. Equating an edition of an engraving with a single state of a plate (whatever "state" means) can only invite misunderstanding. What Verner means by "state" is of course relevant to understanding his comments on edition . He believes that there is "essentially more agreement between descriptive bibliography and carto-bibliography with respect to the meaning attached to the term state than to any other terms used conjointly" (p. 85). In carto-bibliography, he says, "state identifies and designates a particular period in the life of the plate; during another state the plate will differ from the preceding in some particulars." Any difference, in other words, produces a new state. Those accustomed to talking about letterpress material would be more inclined to think of state as referring to the printed pieces produced. This point is not of great moment, since normally a different state of type-impressions on a piece of paper results from a different state of the type. 10 (There is a more substantial point involved, however: description, whether of books or of maps, has as its primary focus the finished products, which in any case are generally the only evidence one has. When a copperplate or a stereotype plate has survived, it can be described, but such description is subordinate to the main business of bibliographical or carto-bibliographical description—to describe and classify the printed or engraved items themselves.) What would be more disturbing to the letterpress bibliographer about this broad conception of state is that it ignores the distinction between the kinds of differences that reflect different publishing intentions, intended to be noticed by the public (differences that create issues , in other words), and those that result from accident or the attempt to correct errors. One may at first think this distinction to be more relevant for books, since state refers to a particular element in a book, whereas issue refers to the book as a whole. (A textual variant can produce two states of given page; but a cancel title leaf with a new publisher's name creates not a second issue of that leaf but a second issue of the whole book.) When one is dealing with a single map (or a letterpress broadside, for that matter), where the whole is made up of one piece of paper, not of physically separate units brought together, one may feel that the issue-state distinction is unnecessary. But even if the distinction is less important for practical purposes in such cases, it remains conceptually significant. And when maps are joined together into books, the possibility of having different states of particular maps and different issues of the whole is just as real as with letterpress books: 11 carto-bibliography cannot be limited to individual maps but must take into account the presence of maps in books, both in atlases and as inserts in letterpress books. 12 In letterpress bibliography, issue and state are subordinate to printing , when an edition consists of more than one printing. For Verner this point is unnecessary, because he dismisses the concept of printing as irrelevant to the study of engraved maps. A printing has traditionally been defined as all the copies printed from a setting of type at one time— that is, in a single press run. Verner asserts, "This is not a pertinent characteristic in the study of early printed maps, since it is impossible to identify with certainty what copies were pulled at the same time so long as the plate was not altered by plate changes" (p. 85). 13 (One might add that even if changes occurred, they would not necessarily coincide with the intervals between printings.) It may well be that distinguishing copies of a letterpress book printed at one time is often easier than determining which copies of an engraving were produced in a single run. Sometimes, for instance, a title-page date, a notice on the verso of the title page, or some other readily recognizable feature identifies a printing. But printings of books are by no means always easily identifiable, and frequently a considerable amount of bibliographical analysis of the physical evidence, along with the investigation of external sources (such as publishers' archives), is necessary before one is in a position to speak with any authority about what printings a given edition may consist of. To say that it is "impossible" to identify printings of engravings is surely an overstatement; to say that it is generally difficult and sometimes impossible would be more reasonable. But to claim that something is not "pertinent" because it is difficult (or even impossible) would seem to represent wishful, rather than logical, thinking. Bibliographical description, whether of books or of maps, seeks to establish historical facts. The fact, for instance, that a particular copperplate was used to produce a group of copies in March of one year and another group two years later is worth putting on record, when it can be ascertained. That facts are not easy to unearth does not mean that the effort should be abandoned. Verner provides no reason for believing that the concept of printing — the designation of copies produced in a single run—is irrelevant to the historical study of engravings. There is a difficulty of terminology that must be faced in connection with printing . Descriptive bibliographers of books have traditionally regarded impression as a synonym for printing , and publishers as well as bibliographers use impression to refer to a group of copies, not to individual copies. However, scholars of cartography and of art history, who regularly deal with engravings, have customarily employed impression to signify each copy made from a copperplate. One must admit that this usage has as much logic as the other—indeed, it probably has more. Each copy of a book is an impression from the type, just as each copy of an engraving is an impression from the copperplate. The only problem is one of convention: impression is not conventionally used to mean "copy" by bibliographers of letterpress. This difference of usage is awkward, but nothing more: it does not reflect any underlying differences of process in the two areas so drastic as to make a common vocabulary impossible. Both usages of impression , however, are so well established that it would be futile to try to eliminate one of them. Instead, one can avoid ambiguity either by using "copy" and "printing" rather than impression or by incorporating an explanatory phrase into any discussion where impression appears, if the context would not by itself make the meaning clear. Having these two meanings for impression is not ideal, but neither is it a matter for serious concern. It is a relatively superficial problem, on an entirely different level from the effort to think through logically the conceptual relationship between printing from engraved copperplates and printing from type. That Verner's attempt to do the latter leaves something to be desired is further illustrated by his definitions of four terms that he says "are applicable only to printed maps" (p. 86). It is worth looking at these definitions, for their deficiencies are instructive, particularly in regard to the question whether description is to be focused on the copperplate or on the copies made from it. The first of these terms is "change": "Any alteration effected to a plate which prints on successive impressions pulled after the change is made constitute a plate change and create a new state of the plate." 14 This statement perfectly illustrates the problem through its inclusion, as a restrictive clause, of the words "which prints on successive impressions pulled after the change is made." By shifting here from the plate to the impression, the sentence succeeds only in making the nonsensical assertion that plate changes are changes that show up in printed copies made from the plate. Obviously one could change a plate and never print from it, but it would be no less a change for that. The fact of a change in the plate is not tied to whether the plate is actually printed from, though of course normally the only evidence one has for a plate change is a surviving impression made from that plate. One can legitimately say that two states of the impressions made from a plate, if they are of a certain kind, 15 are evidence of a change in the plate; but one cannot turn the point around and say that changes in the plate are changes for which evidence exists in printed impressions. The illogic of Verner's statement derives from a wavering as to whether he is talking about plates or impressions from them. 16 If his focus had been consistently on description of the printed artifacts, with subordinate references when appropriate to the history of the plates as inferred from the artifacts, there would be fewer problems with his work. 17 His definition of "variant copy" suffers in the same way. "The term variant copy ," he says, "is used to identify an impression which can be distinguished from another one pulled from the same plate and state, where the differentiating characteristics occur on more than one such impression and do not result from alterations to the plate itself as in the case of watermarks in the paper." Because his emphasis in defining state and "change" is on the plate, he feels the need for a term to refer to other changes that affect the finished product. But if he had kept that product at the center, he could have recognized more easily that differences in the plate and differences in the paper both produce differences in the resulting artifact and that it is logical (if perhaps unconventional) to regard both as resulting in different states of the finished prints. Indeed, either could result in different issues as well as states: the use of two different grades of paper, for example, might signify two issues just as much as might certain kinds of changes made in the plate. Because the use of state to mean "state of the plate" is so well established among those who write about engravings, one will no doubt have to speak of "state of the print" (or some such term) when one is referring to the printed piece of paper. But logic dictates that state and issue , as terms for the classification of artifacts, must encompass all kinds of differences present in the artifacts at the time of their release to the public. This approach does not of course result in any blurring of the distinction between differences in the plate and differences in the printing, for the features determining issues and states would obviously be recorded in any description; what it does is provide a logical framework for showing relationships among printed copies, taking into account the paper and the inked impressions that together make up those copies. The term "variant copy," as Verner defines it, thus seems unnecessary; as a technical term it is unwise because it is conceived too broadly to make the distinction between issue and state. Not the least curious aspect of his definition is its stipulation that "the differentiating characteristics occur on more than one such impression." If only one surviving copy is on paper with a particular watermark, one cannot be sure that others did not once exist; and even if only one ever existed, the use of that paper is still a historical fact. The two remaining terms, "ectype" and "piracy," raise a somewhat different problem, but one of equal importance from a theoretical point of view. "The term ectype ," Verner announces, "is used to identify a particular plate of a map which is very similar to that which it replicates but differs from the original only with respect to bibliographical details." He then adds, "This term has no counterpart in descriptive bibliography." The reason it has no counterpart is not that there is no parallel situation but that, as defined here, the concept is confused. If a plate is "very similar" to another one, it is nevertheless a different plate—just as a plate of a map representing a totally different geographical area would be a different plate. What links the two "very similar" plates together is their content—or what in connection with letterpress books might be called the "work" embodied in the physical object. It is conventional to distinguish between a "work" (an arrangement of words and punctuation) and a "book" (a concrete object that embodies one representation of a work). When a verbal work is set in type a second time, the resulting edition may be just as different from the first in typography, paper, and binding as an edition of some other work; it is related to the first only because the arrangement of type-impressions in it is meant to be a representation of the same work. In the case of maps, one would have to define what the counterpart of "work" would be. It would obviously not be simply a question of geographical region, scale, projection, and so on, but of individual attempts at such delineation. Defining what is meant by the "same" work or deciding when a version becomes "another" work is a problem relevant to all fields. Is is a problem, however, that relates to intellectual content rather than to physical form. Bibliographers of books have not needed a word like "ectype" because their basic terminology relates to the physical aspects of books, and different settings of type are different editions regardless of the content of what is set; when they need to discuss several editions because those editions contain the same work (and they do, of course, have to decide what texts can be regarded as versions of the same work), it seems sufficient to refer to the first edition, second edition, and so on, of that work. The trouble with a term like "ectype" is that it joins considerations of content and of form: it refers not only to a separate edition (a distinct plate) but one that at the same time is related in content to another one. Such a term, if a real need for it as a shorthand expression could be demonstrated and if it were precisely defined, could perhaps be condoned—though I wonder if it would not always inhibit clarity. In any case "ectype" is defined too vaguely to be of use: what is meant by saying that one map is "very similar" to another? Earlier in his paper Verner is more detailed on this matter but does not solve the problem. He explains that an ectype "will have an identical geographical and cartographical form with its prototype but differ from it in bibliographical details"—as opposed to a "derivative" map, which "may differ from a prototype in every way except the geographical information conveyed" (p. 79). This statement, in turn, is explained by adding that "an ectype will present the same geographical area at the same scale as the original it replicates, while a derivative may differ from its prototype with respect to the total area depicted, the scale, or the relationship among the bits of geographical data contained on the map." It would seem, in other words, that an ectype is an edition (and perhaps a version as well) of a work, whereas a derivative is an edition of a wholly different work that happens to draw on a particular earlier work as a source. Bibliographers will obviously need to make such a distinction; but among editions of the same work it is still not clear what advantage there is in having a term to refer to one that "may reproduce another with considerable exactitude but differ from its prototype in such detail that there is no possible chance to confuse the two." Whether a bibliographer judges a chance for confusion to exist seems an eccentric criterion of classification. This point can be illustrated by considering Verner's fourth exclusively carto-bibliographical term, "piracy": "The term piracy applied to a particular plate of a map which is so like the original which it replicates that it is apt to be mistaken for that original but which was issued by a publisher other than the one who published the original map" (p. 86). If "piracy' 'is supposed to indicate an unauthorized edition, as the word would naturally suggest, the definition does not make the point clear. For is it not possible that an authorized publisher could use a new plate so close to the original that it is "apt to be mistaken" for it? Can an ectype—a plate "very similar" to another but clearly distinguishable from it—never be pirated? The terms are not mutually exclusive, for they mix up considerations of similarity of content with circumstances of publication. It would seem to be more sensible for the basic terms of bibliographical classification to refer strictly to physical evidence; these terms can then be modified, as the occasion warrants, with adjectives that express various other considerations, reflecting publishing circumstances or characterizing content, as in "English edition," "pirated edition," "revised edition," and the like. Verner assumes that traditional descriptive bibliography does not operate in this way: the term "piracy," he claims, "has no equivalent in descriptive bibliography where a pirated edition would be identified merely as another edition." A pirated edition would certainly be another edition, but that fact does not prevent one from calling it a "piracy" as well, or a "pirated edition," and those terms are in fact used and understood by bibliographers of letterpress books. The essential point is that "piracy" describes the nature of the publication history and the publisher's motivation, and it thus refers to a different set of considerations from those that result in the designation of "edition." Verner in effect recognizes this point when he says that a piracy "should be designated as one of the plates of the original with the added designation of Piracy, e.g. , PLATE III, Piracy " (p. 79)—which is parallel to such a phrase as "third edition, pirated." The third act of engraving of a particular map (a "work"), like the third act of typesetting of a verbal work, produces the third plate or third edition of the work, whether or not it is "pirated." But these clear lines are blurred by Verner's definition of a piracy as a "copy of a map that is so like its prototype that the two might be confused." One of course hopes that a bibliography, by setting the facts straight, will provide the means for distinguishing among items that might be confused; but the bibliographer's assessment of potential confusion cannot be the basis of bibliographical classification or the determinant of a piracy. This curious emphasis recurs in other statements: "The inclusion of such piracies in the description of an original map also eliminates the possibility that the copy might be considered to be a different map, thus acquiring validity as an historical document which it does not actually possess." The acquiring or losing of "validity" does not affect classification, nor therefore the arrangement of entries implied by the classification; if a particular piracy is found to be the third engraving of a work, then it naturally falls into the position thus dictated, whether its stature is enhanced or lowered by that placement. In any case, a piracy, simply because it may have been intended to be taken for something other than what it is, does not thereby lose "validity as an historical document." It exists; it played a role in the publication history of the work; and it is therefore a historical document. The fact that it is not the first publication of the work does not deprive it of validity as a document—though of course its significance will vary depending on the purposes for which one turns to it as documentary evidence. Verner's paper obviously serves a useful function in focusing attention on some central issues in the description of engraved material, but it is clearly unsatisfactory in many of the statements it makes about those issues. In regard to the central question of the relationship between carto-bibliographical description and the traditional bibliographical description of books, a more thoughtful approach had been expressed some thirty years before by Lloyd A. Brown. One paragraph of his Notes on the Care &amp; Cataloguing of Old Maps (1941) is worth quoting in full: The confusion of terms used in describing old maps rises from the fact that the processes employed in their production are those employed in the manufacture of the kind of print usually associated with works of art; for example, etchings, line engravings, and mezzotints, which depict scenic views, portraits and various types of still life. The natural result of this similarity of form and technique is that dealers, collectors and librarians have automatically applied the nomenclature of graphic art to old maps. And yet there have been other dealers, collectors and librarians who saw first in old maps the characteristics of printed books, pamphlets, broadsides and newspapers. It was natural for the latter group to apply to maps the nomenclature of printing, considering them first of all as publications. These two schools of thought are responsible for a steady growth of confusion in the terms employed to record descriptive data relating to maps, though both groups would probably have agreed with each other if they had been able to exchange ideas at firsthand, demonstrating concretely what feature they were describing when a given term was used. As the situation stands today, few authorities agree on the proper nomenclature to be applied to early maps. Nevertheless, if such maps are subjected to all the tests applied to the bibliography of graphic art, and all the tests employed in the bibliography of publications, per se, there is actually no conflict in the terminology commonly applied to each. Old maps must be considered from both angles if they are to be thoroughly understood and fairly appraised. (pp. 83-84) The precise definitions that Brown proceeds to offer, though they are generally sensible, are not those regarded as standard today 18 —a fact that is not surprising, because he was writing before Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949). 19 But the approach Brown was using is one that we should not lose sight of, for he recognized that a difference of terminology between fields is in itself a superficial matter and that one should not be hindered by the traditions of individual fields from seeing similarities of processes and concepts underlying the different terms. Verner's contention that the terminology of letterpress bibliography is "not applicable" to carto-bibliography because the conditions being described are too dissimilar is not supported by the arguments he advances. Instead, an examination of his paper makes it all the more apparent that the concepts referred to by edition, printing, issue , and state in letterpress bibliographical classification are relevant to material printed from intaglio plates as well. The usage of certain words, such as "impression," is different in the two fields, but that kind of difference is not really a serious obstacle to thought. Letterpress bibliographers and carto-bibliographers cannot avoid coming to terms with the concepts that are common to both fields, for they often find themselves dealing with the same physical entities—books that include, or are entirely composed of, engraved maps. The crucial difficulty is not what differences there may be between relief and intaglio printing but the shift in thinking required to move from dealing with single-sheet entities to treating composite entities (made up of more than one engraving, or more than one letterpress sheet, or engravings mixed with letterpress sheets). If bibliographers are to meet the challenges posed by their materials, they must not stress the differences in these situations but search for the larger framework that includes them both. We can pursue this line of thinking further by turning to the other 1974 work mentioned earlier, D. W. Krummel's Guide for Dating Early Published Music . In the section entitled "Differences between Copies" (pp. 30-48), Krummel 20 takes up questions of bibliographical classification, and from the outset we know we are in the presence of a person who has given sustained and methodical thought to these matters. A carefully balanced note at the beginning reports that some music bibliographers doubt whether "the terminology of general bibliography, growing out of experience with literary texts, mostly printed from movable type, should be used for musical editions, mostly printed from engraved plates"; but it concludes unequivocally: "The present study," Krummel says, "endorses the use in music bibliography of the terms of the general bibliographer." 21 The argument leading to that conclusion is enlightened: "advantages are to be gained from drawing on the experience and the systematic thinking of several generations of general bibliographers, concerned with essentially the same problems." Recognition that the problems are "essentially the same" is an important step in itself. The comprehensiveness that it implies for bibliographical concepts is reflected in the definition of edition that immediately follows: "the whole number of copies printed from substantially the same printing surfaces (be they settings of type, engraved plates, or lithographic stones), at any time or times." 22 This essentially standard definition is made to include not only music but any engraved material—and, beyond that, all printed material, whether the printing surface is relief, intaglio, or planographic. The approach places engraved music—the immediate subject—in the larger conceptual framework of which it is logically a part. It recognizes that the nature of the printing surface does not alter the need for a term to refer collectively to all the exemplars representing a given act of drawing, engraving, typesetting, and so on. If this term can be identical in all fields, the chances for confusion are undoubtedly lessened; but establishing identical terms is less important than recognizing the identity of the concept to which the terms refer. The objection to Verner's term "plate," therefore, has more substance than simply the fact that it is a different word: it leads one away from the recognition of identity of concept because the word seems to direct attention to the printing surface itself, not to the copies made from it, and is awkward as a collective noun. 23 The importance of Krummel's integrative approach cannot be overemphasized; it is clearly the direction in which bibliographical thinking must proceed. After defining edition , Krummel goes on to take up issue, state , and impression , in that order. His discussions are thoughtful, as one would expect, and (with one significant exception, to which I shall return) they reflect the standard definitions as commonly understood by letterpress bibliographers at the time Krummel was writing. His comments on issue (pp. 31-32), for example, are "quoted and paraphrased from Bowers" and form a fair, if highly compressed, statement of Bowers's views as represented in the 1949 Principles . They therefore emphasize "re-issue" (as opposed to simultaneous issue, the possibility of which is not suggested) and the role of the title page ("The title page is critical in determining the issue"). Since the time of Krummel's book, however, I have argued for an extension of Bowers's essentially sound definition, in order to accommodate a wider range of manifestations of publishers' intentions for creating discrete publishing units—particularly those that result from practices employed in the period of publishers' bindings. 24 It is not necessary to repeat the argument in detail here. I shall simply say that publishers can and do create issues (that is, consciously planned publishing units, intended to be recognized as such) by means that do not necessarily involve title pages—as when they insert half-titles with a new series name or use a different binding (casing) meant to identify that series. And the concept of simultaneous issue (recognized, but not extensively discussed, by Bowers) need not depend on typographical alterations, for a group of copies on large or special paper—even without any other changes—would constitute a distinct publishing unit, planned along with the regular copies and perhaps published simultaneously with them: the large-paper copies would be an issue, but not a reissue. Krummel's basic definition of issue as "a consciously planned unit" (quoting Bowers) is certainly satisfactory, as far as it goes; but it is then interpreted with undue narrowness, citing reissues and title-page alterations. One example of the emphasis on title pages: "when a number of small editions are brought together and re-issued with one collective title page (as with an opera score assembled from the separate editions of its individual selections), the item is a re-issue because of the collective title page." But it could also be an issue without a collective title page, if other means were used to segregate it as a publishing unit—a publisher's binding, for instance (as opposed to a custom binding, which would probably signify only an individual binding-up of these particular selections, rather than an issue of them by the publisher). 25 The emphasis on reissues is further evident in the comments on state , where it is asserted that "By definition, a new issue is re-issued" (p. 34). Krummel's discussion of state raises a few additional questions. He equates state with "variant" and defines it as "any form of musical publication which exhibits variations in content caused by purposeful alteration of the printing surface" (p. 32). I have similarly argued, since Krummel wrote, that this concept should be broader: it should cover, in my view, any differences that the publisher does not regard as indicating a discrete publishing effort (and therefore that the publisher does not wish to call to the attention of the public). Such differences need not be in "content" or "of the printing surface"; they can be any kind of difference, whether in the printed image or the paper or the binding. Nor do they need to be "purposeful"; they can be accidents, as well as corrections of errors or attempts at improvement. Since bibliographical description aims at describing the forms of publications as they were published, it must recognize variations among copies that are inadvertent as well as those that are intended; in either case, they are differences and must be recognized. Krummel properly notes that publishers were "under no obligation to mention the changes, and in fact usually found it inconvenient and even undesirable to do so." It follows from this essential characteristic of a state that states (as opposed to issues) refer to particular constituent parts of books (a gathering, an inserted plate, the casing) rather than to whole copies of books. In this respect, Krummel's phrase "any form of musical publication," in his definition of state , is perhaps unwise, because by referring to the whole "publication" he does not clarify as much as he might the distinction between issue and state . Since for him a "new state contains a different text" (p. 34), 26 it is natural that he recommends to editors "in search of an authentic text" that they "must study all copies which make up an authentic edition to locate variant states" (p. 32). And of course this advice is correct. But his suggestion that states are of more consequence than issues to editors (with the reverse being the case for cataloguers) is perhaps stated uncautiously: distinguishing among issues, he says, "may prove quite irrelevant to the editor, since the musical text itself may be completely unchanged." 27 An issue may or may not contain textual variants (just as a state may be determined by textual or nontextual elements), but the question must be pursued in any case; the absence of textual variants does not make the existence of issues or states irrelevant to an editor, for an editor's preparation must include as full a knowledge as possible of the production and publication history of the work being edited. The fourth standard term that Krummel takes up is impression , which he appropriately defines as "all of the copies as a unit run off the press at one particular time (i.e., as one 'press run')." What is striking in his treatment of impression is not the definition itself, but its placement in fourth position, following edition, issue , and state . Although he does not say explicitly in his section on impression that he regards this concept as a subordinate classification to state , the point becomes clear when he cites an example in which the "third state exists in two impressions" and when he asserts, "It is axiomatic that two copies from the same impression display no differences at all in text" (p. 36). 28 Later, in a paragraph on the "hierarchic" relationship of the four terms (p. 39), he does become explicit, providing a diagram for an example showing an edition first divided into two issues, with the first issue then divided into three states, and the first state in turn comprising two impressions. 29 This conception of impression is the major departure Krummel makes from Bowers, and it represents the principal way that readers of Krummel's discussion are likely to be led astray. One may imagine how it came about: in Bowers's treatment of the period before the eighteenth century, the sequence of terms is indeed edition, issue , and state , because in that period type was almost never kept standing, and as a result each new printing of a work was likely to be a new typesetting, a new edition; in those few cases where a new impression from standing type did occur, Bowers "most reluctantly" (see Principles , p. 394) suggested the term "issue (re-impression)." Despite this special usage, Bowers makes clear in his detailed discussion of the classification of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books that issue and state "indicate alterations which separate the sheets of some copies of a single impression from others of that impression according to certain variations" (p. 395). The practice of bibliographers, almost without exception, is consistent with this view, regarding issue and state as subordinate to impression . The standard definitions of the four basic terms do not logically admit any other hierarchy: an issue, for instance, could not consist of several impressions, for a group of copies forming a discrete publishing unit could not comprehend the output of several different press runs over a period of time. Although impression as a term is less likely to be needed for books before the nineteenth century, the concept of course applies for all periods: in the earlier periods an edition generally consists of a single impression, but the identity of edition and impression in those cases does not mean that the concepts have altered. Krummel's book is intended to deal principally with music between 1700 and 1860, and thus Bowers's discussions in the later part of the Principles , as well as those in the earlier, are relevant. A concept of impression that apparently derives from Bowers's idea of "issue (re-impression)" for early books is not appropriate to the classification of books from the last two centuries. 30 Krummel proceeds to the difficult question of the integrity of copies. Although he deals with it briefly and from the point of view of cataloguers (likely the main component of his audience) rather than bibliographers, he does recognize the logical necessity of moving on to this matter. First he seeks to define copy and rather puzzlingly offers two very different definitions, adding that the second "would appear on general principles to be the better one to follow" (p. 46). It certainly is the preferable one: it defines a copy as comprising "whatever was known or likely to have been offered for sale in the earliest copy . . . including wrappers, catalogues, and the like." 31 The earlier definition takes copy to exclude wrappers, catalogues, and "other material superfluous to the content and the publishing event." But one is dealing with published items, and if a catalogue or a publisher's wrapper or casing was part of the entity as published, then it is part of "the publishing event," whether or not it is "superfluous to the content." However, the question of determining what in fact was a part of a copy as published is a central one in connection with books not in publishers' casings, especially when those books contain both letterpress and engraved material or consist of items also made available separately. As an illustration of the view that often "the precise entity is impossible to determine," Krummel cites the libretto of Don Giovanni , which "may, or may not, be seen as an integral part of the Breitkopf &amp; Härtel full score (1801)." Perhaps it would be clearer to say that for books not published in bindings or casings, or not now surviving in publishers' bindings or casings, one cannot always determine which of various separable units now bound together were placed on sale originally as combined entities. It may well be in many instances (as perhaps in the Mozart example) that the units were available both singly and together; in such situations, it would not be historically accurate to think of a single "precise entity," for there would have been three or more entities. In any event, "items which are composite in their texts," as Krummel calls them, are always a problem, even when the material is all letterpress, and they are likely to pose a particularly prominent problem when engraved illustrations, maps, and music are involved. As common musical examples, Krummel mentions collected volumes of series (the title pages of which may not reflect, in date or other respects, the series as a whole), volumes containing supplements (where the presence of the supplement may be a sign of a new issue or may merely result from an owner's binding together two independent items), anthologies in which the individual pieces are printed from plates previously used in other combinations in other volumes (and perhaps carrying individual pagination), and books that draw on "the same basic 'repertory' of plates," each of them resulting from "individualized assembly for a particular purchaser, much like certain early engraved atlases" (p. 47). These all raise interesting bibliographical questions, which cannot sensibly be speculated about on the basis of a single copy—which is all that a cataloguer, by definition, is called upon to examine. Krummel's comments, then, do not explore such books in any depth ("the busy cataloguer should be satisfied with the title page, although the editor and bibliographer will want to look further"); but it is noteworthy that he calls attention to the problem, which has not been much discussed and which is central to the bibliographical treatment of books combining materials printed from different kinds of surfaces. The contrast between Krummel and Verner could hardly be more striking. Krummel's discussion is clearly the more reasoned and thoughtful; and, even if it requires some modification here and there, it demonstrates a sound and fruitful basic approach. But the process of examining the arguments of Verner, in addition to those of Krummel, has served, I hope, to show what the principal issues are. Underlying everything else are the opposite positions these two writers take on the question whether the terms—and therefore the concepts—of classification in letterpress bibliography are applicable to non-letterpress material. The answer to this question, as I trust the present discussion has shown, cannot really be in doubt: the concepts that have been given the labels edition, printing ( impression ), issue , and state in letterpress bibliography are relevant to all printed matter, regardless of the nature of the printing surface. 32 Some of the terms themselves have not always been used in the same ways in different fields, but one should not be misled by variant usages into thinking that the concepts are different. No doubt certain terms—notably impression —will continue to be employed in more than one sense, but this situation should not be regarded as a serious problem, for the context should make the meaning clear. 33 What is of far more significance is that the concepts represented by the basic terms of letterpress bibliography be thoroughly understood by bibliographers of all kinds of material. The importance of this understanding is not simply practical—though of course there is a great practical advantage involved, since materials printed from different kinds of surfaces are often brought together in publication and must therefore be treated in a single bibliography. Rather, the importance of making these connections lies in the fact that the activities of printing and publishing are conceptually similar whatever the printing surface, and the bibliographical classification of printed matter will be misleading as historical scholarship if it does not reflect that fact. To have reached this position—as Krummel has—is actually to have taken a considerable step forward, and everything else one may say about the description of non-letterpress material rests on this basis. Another central point is that bibliographical description in all fields must be concerned primarily with the printed items themselves, not with the printing surfaces that produced them. The bibliographer can infer certain facts about the plates, types, or stones from the finished product; but that product is the primary evidence, capable of being examined directly by the bibliographer, and is the object of the description. That the bibliographer's focus must be on the published entity is particularly obvious when one considers publications that consist of more than one unit—several letterpress sheets, or letterpress sheets joined with engraved music, maps, or illustrations. In these cases, although one must try to do justice to the component parts, one must also account fully for the composite entity, which is a fact of publishing history. Some parts of a book may have had a separate existence, as independent entities, outside the book; but their role within the book is nevertheless an aspect of their history, and descriptive bibliographers, whether of books or of prints, have to be prepared to deal with such items both as separate entities and as parts of books. If one thoroughly understands the concepts behind edition, printing, issue , and state , one should have no difficulty in explaining clearly and precisely the relationship between such parts of a book and the book as a whole, without in any way slighting or obscuring the history of those parts as separate items. Knowledge of the printing surfaces and processes is of course important, but what one finally is describing are not copperplates or formes of composed type but the results of an act of making public the sheets printed from them, often in combination. The classification of a published entity, therefore, cannot be governed by the classifications that may have applied to certain of its parts that were made available to the public separately. For example, since issue and state refer to variations within printings, the insertion of a particular issue of an engraving in all copies of a given printing of letterpress sheets does not result in any differences among copies. The fact that the map, say, was also available separately—and, as a separate, was a second issue—could appropriately be pointed out in the description of the inserted plates in the volume; but the volume as a whole would simply be a first printing, one of the characteristics of which is the inclusion of a map that—as far as its own separate history is concerned— is a second issue. If some copies of the first printing of the book contained the second issue of the map and others contained the first issue, the difference would have to be taken into account in the description of the book, since there would then be a variation distinguishing some copies from others within the same printing; but the result would not necessarily be two issues of the book, simply because two issues of the separate map were involved. There would be two issues only if the use of the second issue of the map became the occasion for a separate publishing effort (indicated, among other possible ways, by a cancel title, perhaps referring to the particular issue of the map included). Otherwise there would be a single issue (that is, a single printing) of the book, in which the map appears in variant states, indentifiable as the first and second issues of the separate map. Whatever created the second issue of the separate map (perhaps a different imprint) does not create an issue of the whole book unless the publisher calls attention to it as characterizing a discrete group of copies. Similarly, if copies of a single issue of the separate map are included in all copies of both the first two printings of the volume, the result is simply two printings of the volume; the presence in them of the same issue of the map does not make all copies of the volume a single issue, because the letterpress sheets, containing the title leaf and other preliminaries, represent two different stages in the printing (and publishing) history of the volume. 34 One should not conclude from these hypothetical examples that letterpress sheets take precedence over non-letterpress material in bibliographical classification. So long as we are talking about non-letterpress "insertions" into books that are largely made up of letterpress sheets, there seems nothing odd in allowing the letterpress material to play a determining role; but many books exist in which the engraved plates bulk far larger than the letterpress sheets (books of engraved music with letterpress prefaces, for instance, or suites of illustrations with brief introductory texts in letterpress). In any case, the relative quantity of the letterpress and the non-letterpress material is not the only factor to consider; equally important is whatever element—most commonly the title page—serves to define the book as an entity. Thus if a cancel letterpress title leaf, with a different publisher's imprint, is inserted into the sole letterpress gathering at the beginning of a volume consisting otherwise entirely of engraved music, a new issue is created, even though the engraved material is dominant in the volume and is invariant. If instead to accomplish the same purpose the entire letterpress sheet (gathering) were reset but the engraved music were still from the original printing, the result would still be an issue—not a new edition, even though the preliminary gathering would be a new edition, since the body of the book would still be of the original printing. Both the bulk and the title page play a role: that the reset material is such a small fraction of the volume (whether the rest is engraved is actually irrelevant) means that a new edition has not been created, even though the reset part includes the title page; and the existence of the new publisher's imprint in the reset part means that the reset gathering cannot be regarded simply as a variant state of the preliminaries but must be considered a sign of a new issue of the book as a whole. Many volumes, of course, contain engraved as well as letterpress title leaves, and the engraved ones, by virtue of being title leaves, form a separate category from other plates that may be present. The evidence they provide must be evaluated in conjunction with that from the letterpress title pages; if the latter are more often dominant as indicators of issue, the engraved titles can also on occasion provide the evidence, and no generalization can be made that would relieve the bibliographer of the responsibility of weighing the evidence from both. Nor is there any point here in outlining further examples or kinds of situations: the number of possible permutations is large, and enough has been said to suggest how they can be dealt with by a consistent application of the principles underlying the basic concepts of bibliographical classification. Any system for handling non-letterpress insertions in letterpress books must be applicable as well to the more general problem of composite volumes containing items (whether or not printed from a different kind of surface) that have had an independent publication history. Judgment is involved in applying terms like edition and issue to these volumes, and bibliographers will not always agree in their assessment of complicated situations. But if they understand the basic concepts of classification and recognize the double level of classification required when independent entities are incorporated into larger entities, they are sure to clarify the publication histories of the volumes they describe. The object, after all, is to explain a course of events as clearly as possible to the reader, and one is free to use phrases and sentences in addition to the basic terms. Attempting to assign terms like edition, issue , and state should not be an exercise in applying arbitrary definitions but should be a process that allows one more clearly to see, and express, relationships. The same kinds of relationships exist among the elements of composite volumes in all fields; and asking all bibliographers—regardless of the subject matter they specialize in—to work within this one framework of classification is not to impose restrictions on them but to assist them in making their labors as productive as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II After one has thought about these questions of classification, the next step is to consider what pieces of information regarding non-letterpress material ought to be recorded in a descriptive bibliography and where and how they should be incorporated into an individual description. In some respects these matters take care of themselves, if one has a thorough grasp of bibliographical classification and is familiar with the standard approaches to the description of other elements of books, such as type and paper (since those methods can easily be adapted to the description of non-letterpress material). There is some value, nevertheless, in taking up the implications of certain decisions about the form and content of the description of non-letterpress material, especially since such material has not been given very extensive coverage in discussions of bibliographical description. Indeed, Greg said in 1932 that book illustration is "a subject whose appeal or relevance lies primarily in the realm of graphic art and not of bibliography" and that engravings, "separately printed and stuck into otherwise already complete books, show the minimum of relevance to their surroundings." 35 These remarks, it must be recognized, actually occur in a passage arguing that bibliographers should give attention to illustrations: even though such work may contribute "mainly to the history of art," it is also "work essential to booklore, work that can be justified on the most rigid bibliographical grounds." Yet the textual orientation of Greg's approach to description is evident: although the connection of some illustrations with books "may be of the most superficial and fortuitous character," others (especially in "books of a technical character") "may be said to form an integral part of the text," and in any case illustrations may provide evidence relevant to "the history of the transmission of the text." The central point called for by Greg's discussion—but a point that does not emerge clearly from it—is that the descriptive bibliographer's task is to describe books as published entities and that illustrations, when included in books, are naturally part of what the bibliographer must describe; the degree of connection between the illustrations and the text is irrelevant. Greg comes close to making this point when he says that illustration "claims the attention of bibliographers merely on the ground that these products of art happen to be found in books"; but his inclusion of "merely" in the sentence is revealing. Some people will be less—and others more—interested in the art than in the text, but both are parts of the physical object to be described. The books that Greg was principally concerned with did not require him to consider the problem of inserted plates in much detail, and little is said about them in his comprehensive (and major) statement on descriptive bibliography occupying most of the fourth volume (1959) of A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration . 36 J. D. Cowley, in Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing (1939), provides a brief section on "Plates and Insets" (pp. 105-106), which begins rather shakily but recovers in the second of these sentences: "Typographically, I suppose, books may be held to be complete without any plates that they may be intended to have when they are published, because the plates are printed separately and are not included in the signed gatherings. But since in bibliography we are describing books as they were published, we must account for the plates in the technical note." His view is that they should not be included in the formulaic signature collation but should be entered in the form of a brief register (e.g., "plates, Front., I-VI") following the pagination statement, with a description "in a separate paragraph dealing with illustrations or in the analysis of the contents." Although he does not recommend giving the location of plates (normally, at least before the nineteenth century, "it is practically impossible to determine the exact position which any particular plate or inset was intended to occupy"), he suggests, somewhat inconsistently, that inserted maps, tables, and the like, not part of a regular sequence of plates, be specified by location ("plates [6]; inset tables following pp. 56, 72, 104"). 37 Ten years later Fredson Bowers, in Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), also devoted very brief space to engraved title pages and plates (see especially pp. 287-289 and 446), but what he says is characteristically incisive and logical and provides a sound basis to build on. His recommendations are essentially the same as Cowley's, except that he stipulates the recording of the positions of plates—as in "plates [3] (opp. sigs. C4 v , F1, G4 v )"—using signature or page references to the facing pages. 38 But he provides a more thoroughly reasoned statement of the desirability of limiting the signature collation to material that went through the printing press and of recording non-letterpress insertions separately. There is no question that signature collations, which can become complicated enough when there are letterpress insertions to account for, are made less easily usable by the inclusion of other kinds of insertions as well. 39 Bowers has argued this position so effectively (pp. 198-201) that it should now be regarded as conclusively established. The place for a register of plate numbers (or an indication of the number of plates, if unnumbered) is—he (like Cowley) believes—at the end of the register of pagination; a description of the plates can occupy a separate later paragraph, although Bowers would make an exception for frontispieces and engraved title leaves and would include them in the contents paragraph (p. 289). Bowers's treatment of engraved material recognizes its importance: he never implies that it is less deserving of the bibliographer's attention than the letterpress. The brevity of his discussion of this subject—the absence of the wealth of detail that he provides for other parts of the description—reflects his experience (and the tradition of bibliography out of which his work grew), which largely involves books more noteworthy for their verbal content than for their illustrations and in fact containing relatively few illustrations. The most thorough contributions to the question of the bibliographical study of inserted plates have emerged, not surprisingly, from the examination of botanical books. Unlike atlases and music books, in which engraved leaves often form a solid block of material without intervening letterpress leaves, botanical books consist of engravings inserted into letterpress gatherings often enough to make the problem of their relationship a pressing one; and unlike literary books, in which illustrations are often regarded as serving only a decorative function, botanical books normally contain illustrations that are essential parts of what the works as a whole are intended to convey. Gordon Dunthorne is generally recognized as a pioneer in the bibliographical treatment of plates in his Flower and Fruit Prints of the 18th and Early 19th Centuries (1938). He was writing before Cowley and Bowers, of course, and his work now seems rather rudimentary, although many more recent bibliographies have not been as detailed in their handling of plates. What he did recognize was the value of noting plate marks, imprints, and watermarks, and he attempted to work out a concise method for recording them (using abbreviations such as TC for "top center" to indicate positions on the plate). A more significant landmark is Allan Stevenson's work in the second volume (1961) of the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt . The remarkable introduction to that volume, which in explaining the methods employed becomes a 65-page exposition of the fundamentals of descriptive bibliography, offers the most extended discussion of the formal description of plates yet available (pp. clxvi—clxxvi). It agrees with Bowers in excluding plates from the signature collation but extends the point by objecting to tacking a register of plate numbers on to the end of the pagination statement. Stevenson argues instead that there should be a separate collation of plates (parallel to the collation of printed sheets), accompanied by descriptions of the plates and detailed plate lists (which would be the counterpart to the contents paragraph for the letterpress material). 40 He devotes his longest discussion to the plate lists, which are essentially lists of the botanical names for the plants depicted: his procedure is to quote the polynomials or binomials from the plates and then to append in brackets any corrections or modern reductions, sometimes citing authorities and intermediate forms. This part of Stevenson's work clearly required extensive research, 41 and it reflects the importance of the plates to botanists as evidence in questions concerning priority of nomenclature. Although the specific problems would be different in other fields, the kind of attention given here to the content of the plates is exemplary. 42 More recently the field has been given yet another advance in an excellent paper read before the April 1975 meeting of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History by Gavin D. R. Bridson. 43 The point of view underlying the paper is summed up in Bridson's statement that "the aim should be to record and describe plates with the same degree of precision already accorded to letterpress aspects of the book" (pp. 471-472); he quotes some of Bowers's remarks on the need to go beyond description to analysis and then calls for "the same analytical approach" to be applied to plates (p. 473). Bridson praises Stevenson's work but surpasses Stevenson in the demands he makes on bibliographers; his paper is in effect a supplement to Stevenson, taking up the aspects of plates that Stevenson enumerates for description and outlining further complications connected with them. He convincingly shows why bibliographers need to have a thorough understanding of graphic processes (more than just the ability to identify the various media) and how a detailed description, as with letterpress, serves to facilitate further discovery. Anyone undertaking to describe a book with plates should give thought to Bridson's remarks. The principal issues that emerge from these discussions can best be considered in two categories: those that have to do with the actual description of the non-letterpress material and those concerned with how to incorporate those descriptive details into the formal description of the entire book. The former are the more significant, because they are substantive, but the latter are not without substantive implications. Certain decisions about the substance of a description, of course, may obviate certain questions of form: if, for instance, the treatment of plates is reduced to the simple statement that there are so many engravings after paintings by a particular artist and so many after paintings by another, the question whether the information about plates should be presented all at once or distributed among the paragraphs of the description does not arise. And such brief statements may be regarded as appropriate on certain occasions. As with the other elements in a description, various levels of detail may be adopted, depending on the nature of the material and the primary purpose that the bibliography or catalogue is intended to serve. 44 The parts should normally be kept in proportion to one another, and if the letterpress is given abbreviated treatment, the plates should probably receive similar treatment. If the plates are the principal interest of the volumes and if the audience for the bibliography consists largely of art historians, there is naturally good reason to go into some detail about the plates; but in that case one should usually provide more information about the letterpress as well, recognizing that evidence from the one, as part of a combined object, may be relevant to interpreting evidence from the other. There is no doubt about the value to historical scholarship of bibliographies that describe rather than merely identify, and wherever possible descriptions should be conceived on a scale that will allow the treatment of plates to include the kinds of details to be enumerated below. In any case the cardinal rule, exemplified in Bridson's paper, is that descriptive bibliography cannot logically slight any element that goes to make up the finished book, and plates must be dealt with as fully as letterpress. Stevenson designates four groups of "the main identifying and descriptive details" to be recorded in his plate descriptions: "1) designation of type of plate and range of subjects; 2) titles, artist signatures, imprints; 3) sizes of typical plates, in inches and tenths; 4) position of plates" (p. clxxi). We may postpone consideration of the positions of plates, for that is a separate matter: it has to do with the physical relationship of the plates to the letterpress, whereas the other items relate strictly to the plates themselves (and would apply as much to the plates as separate items as they do to the plates as parts of books). Bowers's account of what is called for in describing plates in nineteenth- and twentieth-century books is similar: in addition to transcribing the lettering, "The analysis should state the method by which the plate was made and printed, and the color of the ink, together with the medium of the original. When the letterpress [or the other transcribed lettering] does not make the subject of the illustration clear, a brief account may be given"—"but," he adds, "it is impossible to describe a plate in sufficient detail to provide a basis for the detection of unknown 'states'" (p. 446). It is not always possible to do this for letterpress either: in both cases one cannot know whether the details chosen for inclusion will be those that vary in unexamined copies. But one will have looked at multiple copies of the books to be described, and one can report on variations discovered in them, both in the letterpress and in the plates. Bibliographers should of course have photocopies of the plates with them when they examine copies of the books at different locations (and ideally should compare copies on the Hinman Collator); in their published bibliographies they should always cite references to published reproductions and indeed should include as many reproductions as possible. Their aim should be—for plates as well as for letterpress—to provide those details that their specialized knowledge (developed from their examination of numerous copies) tells them will be most useful both as a historical record and as a means of uncovering further variations. 45 Many of the details listed by Stevenson and Bowers (e.g., transcribing titles and imprints, providing measurements) are similar to ones that would be given for letterpress material; and the general procedure should be to furnish for non-letterpress material the same categories of information provided for letterpress material, or corresponding categories when the match is not exact. To the details mentioned above, therefore, should be added some comment on the typography or lettering and on the paper. Any satisfying approach to the description of non-letterpress material must be amenable to handling not only interspersed plates but whole sections of books—such as multi-plate sequences devoted to musical compositions, each perhaps with its own title page. Such groups of plates, with consecutive "pages" or leaves, resemble in some respects sequences of letterpress text pages, and such symmetry as can exist in the treatment of the two is desirable. Taking all these considerations into account, I would suggest the following as the categories of information to be provided in a detailed description of non-letterpress material in books. They need not be presented in this order or be separated into these nine units; and although the wording here applies most directly to individual illustrative plates, this outline can, I think, be readily adjusted to accommodate other kinds of non-letterpress material: (1) The title, caption, epigraph, quotation, or other wording meant to identify, describe, or interpret the plate. This wording should be set forth in quasi-facsimile transcription, and a note should indicate what parts of it, if any, are in letterpress. For a book that contains a list of plates, any discrepancies between the wording on the plates and the wording of the citations in the list should be specified, as Bowers points out. When plates do not have titles or other descriptive wording, and often when they do, the bibliographer may well supply brief descriptions of the content of the plates. 46 (2) The medium and process employed . As Bridson notes, one should attempt to go beyond such simple designations of medium as "engraving," "etching," and "lithograph" to specify the precise process used. 47 Analytical bibliography applied to plates, just as when it is applied to letterpress material, requires a detailed knowledge of the technical processes involved; without that knowledge recognition of variants and reconstruction of the history of individual plates are likely to be less accurate. (3) Artists' names . Any artists' names that appear on the plate should be transcribed exactly as they appear. Although Stevenson quotes artists' and engravers' names in "an early or dominant form," with "slight variation" indicated by a superscript "±" (p. clxxi), important evidence may be thus concealed, and the names should always be "given verbatim, misspellings included," as Bridson says (p. 474). One should attempt to ascertain the names of the artist and the engraver when they do not appear, as well as the medium of the original work. (4) Imprint . Any printers' or publishers' imprints should be recorded in quasi-facsimile transcription, and when they do not appear an effort should be made to establish the name of the printer (and of the publisher if the plate was also made available separately from the book that provides the occasion for the description). Small details in an imprint may of course be an important clue for dating. One should be particularly cautious in accepting dates printed from copper or stone (cf. Bridson, p. 475). (5) Dimensions . Depending on the period of the book, something will have been said elsewhere in the description about the size of the leaves of the book or of the sheets used for printing. The point here is to indicate the size of the illustration and of the copperplate or other surface if its mark is present. Stevenson advocates recording plate marks (p. clxxi), whereas Bowers gives priority to the dimensions of the engraved surface (p. 179), although he suggests that both measurements be provided (with the vertical dimension of the engraved surface further subdivided according to what part is illustration and what part lettering). Both are indeed important, and Bridson further shows (p. 474) the usefulness (for distinguishing similar engravings) of noting the relative position of the engraved surface on the plate. Thus to Bowers's example for an engraved title—"plate mark 392 x 198 mm.; engr. tit. with lettering 223(261) x 156 mm." (p. 179)—one should add an indication of the distances to the edge of the plate on each side of the latter dimensions. One might even decide to combine all these figures in the form "60|223(261)| 71 x 15|156|27 mm.," where the figures to the left and right of the vertical lines are the distances to the edge of the plate (above and below, respectively, for the vertical measurement, and left and right for the horizontal). In addition to furnishing these figures, one should also describe the impression made by the edge of the plate, following Bridson's suggestion that it may be helpful to know whether the plate has "a plain or a bevelled edge or square or rounded corners" (p. 474). (6) Typography or lettering . Any letterpress typography should be described, as one would describe any other typography in the volume, and lettering on the plate should be characterized, noting the features that are examined in classifying type or script. 48 (7) Color . Indication should be made of whether the illustration is color-printed or hand-colored (that is, hand-colored, before publication, for the whole edition or some part of it, as opposed to the individual hand-coloring that might occur after publication), and the color, or prominent colors, identified. 49 If important variations in color are discovered through the examination of multiple copies, they should be specified. 50 (8) Paper . The paper on which the non-letterpress material is printed, generally different from the paper for the letterpress, similarly can offer important evidence for dating and should be recorded in the same way that the paper constituting the letterpress sheets is recorded. 51 (9) Bibliographical classification . Some remarks should be added that make clear the status of the plate as an independent entity. If, for example, no variations exist among copies of the plate as they are found within copies of the printing or issue of the book to be described, then strictly speaking perhaps no further comment is required. But if all those copies of the plate are in fact part of the second issue of the plate as separately published, that piece of information is a relevant addition to the description of the plate, even though it has not bearing on the classification of the book as a whole. If, on the other hand, copies of the plate do vary among copies of the printing or issue of the book, the variation would presumably already have been mentioned under one of the headings listed above. The variation, however, could result only in states of the plate, as far as the book is concerned; but if it happened that the variant plates actually constituted two issues as separately published, that fact could be reported here. Descriptions on this level will not always be regarded as feasible: even Allan Stevenson normally listed plates selectively. 52 But when other aspects of a book are to receive detailed treatment, there is no justification for failing to accord the non-letterpress elements a correspondingly detailed treatment. The space required, when a book has numerous plates, is considerable, but a detailed contents paragraph for a complicated book, with quasi-facsimile transcriptions included in it, can also be formidable; in neither case, however, can the value of the detailed record, or the logic of including it in a description, really be questioned. And the space involved is not as great as this enumeration perhaps suggests, for in most books a certain number of details will be the same for all, or nearly all, the plates and need not be repeated each time. For that reason Dunthorne and Stevenson, for example, first report various characteristics that apply to all or most of the plates in a volume and then list the titles of the individual plates. But the alternative approach of conceiving of the record as a list of plates with descriptive details contained in each entry does not mean that recurring details have to be set forth time after time. The particular arrangement will vary with the nature of the material; the listing above—let me repeat—is meant only to suggest the details to be covered, not a necessary order. Those dealing with other kinds of non-letterpress material than individual plates may find that several of these items coalesce. Multi-plate pieces of music, for instance, may have their own engraved title pages, transcription of which may automatically take care of items 1, 3, and 4 above. The form the description takes is not as crucial as the recognition that these categories of detail contribute directly to printing and publishing history and therefore to the history of the transmission of information in whatever field the books are concerned with. In addition to the description of the plates (or other materials) themselves, there is the question of recording their positions in the books in which they occur. Some difference of opinion has existed on this matter. Whereas Bowers takes it as a matter of course that plates and insets have "their positions noted in the description" (p. 288), Stevenson (despite his listing of "position of plates" as one of four items to be included in descriptions) remarks in an often cited (and misused) 53 statement: As for the position of plates within books I have taken the view that this matters less than many have supposed. Luckily I have been usually concerned with one copy, for, when I have compared this with others, I have found such differences, minute and immense, as would make particularization for ten copies impossible. The "ideal copy" is a will-o'-the-wisp. Some books regularly present their plates with little variation. Others vary the order greatly; use this or that plate as a frontispiece; or face plates indiscriminately; and occasionally a binder gets one in upside down. And, as at the same time some plates vary in their states and in the stocks of paper they are printed upon, and some were reprinted after their imprint-dates or the title-date of the book, the permutations and combinations become dizzying for any dull bibliographer. Thus I have not always indicated the exact position and orientation of plates. (p. clxxii) This is one of Stevenson's less happy passages, and several points require comment. He seems to conceive of the concept of ideal copy as denoting a standard of correctness that the publisher wished to achieve rather than as a historical concept referring to what the publisher in fact did achieve. Ideal copy is meant to distinguish the form or forms of a book as released to the public from the defective or altered forms in which one may encounter individual copies as a result of what has happened to those copies since publication. 54 The bibliographer, as a historian of printing and publishing, is interested in establishing what forms the publisher released and does not wish to record as part of a description variations that result from accidental or intentional alterations inflicted upon copies during the course of their separate post-publication histories. Thus in the face of a "dizzying" array of variations among copies in the placement of plates, or in their states, one cannot simply throw up one's hands but must instead attempt to ascertain, through an analysis of all available evidence, the nature and causes of the variations. If there is reason to believe that some or all of the variations, however numerous, represent forms of the book as published, then they are encompassed by ideal copy and must be described; any variations produced by the decisions of individual binders or owners would not be recorded. Distinguishing between these situations is frequently a difficult task for books not released in publishers' bindings; in many cases, of course, the plates were simply made available as a group, but sometimes with printed directions to the binder or with indications of position on the plates themselves. In any case, the point that affects bibliographical treatment is not how many permutations and combinations there are but who was responsible for them. Furthermore, Stevenson's remark that he was lucky in being concerned with only one copy of most books is doubtless true but hardly pertinent, since it has no bearing on the question whether he should record the positions of plates. Since he was writing a bibliographical catalogue of a collection, and not a bibliography, his task by definition was to describe the copy or copies of each book in the Hunt collection, rather than to establish the range of forms that constitutes ideal copy for each book. Thus whether or not to report the positions of plates depended entirely on what level of detail he wished to set for his descriptions and had nothing to do with the relation of the Hunt copies to ideal copy in each case. It is perfectly logical to record, in a catalogue of particular copies of books, the position of the plates in those copies, regardless of how the plates got in those positions. Of course, the catalogue will be even more useful if it sets forth whatever evidence is available in those copies bearing on the question of the responsibility for the present arrangement. In any event, whether the subject is a catalogue or a bibliography, Stevenson's view that the position of plates "matters less than many have supposed" rests on illogical arguments. In fact it matters very much simply because the plates are a part of the book, and one has not described the book without describing their relation to it. But beyond that, since plates are part of the content or "text" of a work, establishment of their positions is a substantive, not merely a formal, matter. Bridson points out, for example, the importance for the study of nomenclatural priority of reconstructing—in the case of books published in fascicles—exactly which plates appeared in each fascicle; 55 and he suggests some techniques of analysis, such as examining stab-holes, offset, staining, and the like, that can help in determining those original arrangements (p. 477). When directions for placing the plates—either as a list or as a statement on each plate—are published with a book, bibliographers have sometimes contented themselves with recording this intended order (which is, of course, important), without further investigating whether the plates originally appeared in a different order, as in fascicle publication. The separate parts of books published serially—whether novels or scientific works with plates—were intended to be bound together, and in their original form many of them are understandably scarce today. But bibliographers must attempt to locate them (not only for the arrangement of their contents but for the information printed on their wrappers) and, whether or not they can be found, must analyze whatever evidence is available in an effort to learn as much as possible about the history of the publication of the books being described. Bibliographers, in other words, cannot stop with a report of what publishers intended but must try to uncover the history of what they actually did. The fascicle order of plates, then, is important in its own right as a fact of publishing history but is also important for the light it may shed on textual and nomenclatural matters. 56 Naturally there may be times when there is insufficient evidence to enable the bibliographer to say anything about the locations of the plates in a volume; but the absence of such information ought to mean that the bibliographer has attempted to secure it and failed, not that it is excluded as a matter of policy. The bibliographer should feel just as obligated to provide the locations of plates or other non-letterpress items as a signature collation of the letterpress sheets; indeed, the two are complementary, for it takes them both to form a complete record of the physical structure of the book. The practical question of how to list these locations therefore must be faced. We may begin by accepting the point established by Bowers, Stevenson, and others that it is a mistake to try to incorporate this information within the collation formula for the letterpress sheets. Of course when one is describing a book in which the non-letterpress material falls in a single block and is not interspersed through the letterpress leaves—as in a fascicle with the plates at the end or an atlas with a letterpress title page and introduction—there is no problem anyway, since the letterpress and non-letterpress do not intrude on one another. This kind of situation could easily be handled in some such manner as the following: 8°: A 8 B-D 8 , 32 leaves, pp. [ 4 ] I 2-59 60 ; followed by plates I-XLII. When the plates are interspersed the record is more complicated, since the location of each plate must be specified. One could attach the record to the end of the collation and pagination line, as above, or make it a separate line: 8°: A 8 B-D 8 , 32 leaves, pp. [ 4 ] I 2-59 60; plates I-V (facing B2 v , B6, C4 v , C8 v , D3). Letterpress . 8°: A 8 B-D 8 , 32 leaves, pp. [ 4 ] I 2-59 60 . Plates . I-V (B2 v , B6, C4 v , C8 v , D3). The difference between the two is obviously not great, and both are clear and relatively concise (the word "facing" or "opposite" can even be dispensed with). However, logic and convenience may give a slight edge to the second approach, since it may be thought to convey more clearly the fact that the plates do not simply follow the letterpress and that the record of plates is in effect another collation formula, going back over the part of the book covered by the first one and focusing on a class of material excluded from it. In any event, the use of signature reference notation shows directly how the plates fit into the structure of the letterpress gatherings; in the case of later books, where references in general are more commonly made to page numbers (and plates may even be labeled with the numbers of the pages they are to face), one might still wish to keep the signature references as well—as in "I-V; B2 v (16), B6(23) . . ."—simply because they provide an easier way of seeing at a glance the structure of the volume as a whole, sheets and plates combined. Signature or page references should be provided again later at the point where each plate is described; otherwise the task of finding a particular plate would involve the annoyance of having to count the location references, a significant inconvenience when the number of plates is large. Of course, the collation of plates could be offered in an expanded form, with each plate number directly attached to a location —as in "I (B2 v ), II (B6), III (C4 v ) . . ."—but such an arrangement would take up considerably more space, and more important, it would not as readily show any irregularities in the sequence of numbers on the plates. Indeed, when there are irregularities, it is a good idea to give a bracketed total in any case—as in "I-X IX-XXII [24]." 57 The inclusion of the plate collation adjacent to the signature collation (clearly the right spot for it) leads to the question where the other details about the non-letterpress material ought to be placed in the description. Conventionally there is a paragraph labeled "Plates" or "Illustrations" that brings together these details. Yet an exception is (rightly) made for an engraved title, which is treated along with the letterpress title page. Thus two principles are at work: the handling of the engraved title and of the plate collation supports the idea that the focus of the description is on the book as an entity and that both letterpress and non-letterpress material will be brought into the description under categories—such as "title page" or "collation"—that refer not to a method of printing but to a characteristic of the completed book; the presence of a "Plates" paragraph, on the other hand, suggests an organization in which the method of production of the material takes precedence over its function in the book. The point is perhaps most clearly illustrated with reference to the description of paper: should the paragraph on plates include a description of the paper used for the plates, or should that description come in the paragraph on paper, which takes up the paper found elsewhere in the book? 58 If one answers that logically the paragraph on paper should include all papers in the book, whether used for letterpress or non-letterpress, one is really taking a stand on the question whether or not a book is fundamentally "complete" when its letterpress is complete. The implied answer is that if the book included plates upon publication, it cannot in any sense be regarded as a complete book without them. If both letterpress and non-letterpress are required to make up the book, then the paper for both comes under the heading of paper for the volume. In this view, is there any justification for a paragraph on plates? Where would the characteristics of plates listed above, other than paper and perhaps typography and lettering, be covered? Those characteristics—involving transcription of wording and description of content—are actually the counterpart of what is covered for letterpress in the contents paragraph. Perhaps there should be two contents paragraphs, corresponding to the two parts of the collation, the first labeled "Letterpress Contents" and the second "Engraved Contents," or some equivalent phrase. The description of the non-letterpress material would then be parallel to that of the letterpress, with information distributed as appropriate in the sections on title, collation, contents, typography, and paper; the notes section could likewise include additional information about plates, such as the report of their bibliographical status as separately published items. The logic of this arrangement is perhaps most easily seen in connection with music books and atlases, where the engraved portions constitute the principal contents: it would be inappropriate to relegate them to a "Plates" section, reserving "Contents" only for letterpress. But the same point can be made about any combination of letterpress and non-letterpress. This approach requires only modest shifts in the arrangement presently regarded as standard; but I think these changes in wording and placement reflect a sounder view of the published book as a physical entity. Books containing non-letterpress material present such a multitude of different situations that bibliographers will inevitably have to make their own adjustments in individual cases, and it is not my aim to try to suggest a simple formal arrangement to be used on all occasions, for that aim is unrealistic. Rather, what I am concerned with is the point of view or general approach that underlies bibliographers' treatment of non-letterpress material. Central to the view I have expressed here is the proposition that the same standards and procedures of classification and description are appropriate and desirable for both non-letterpress and letterpress material. This view further implies that both are equally deserving of the bibliographer's full attention: both are part of the contents, physically and also intellectually, of the books in which they appear together. Non-letterpress material may seem more directly relevant to the intellectual content of books in some fields than in others. One may, for instance, think first of natural history books when reading a comment like W. M. Ivins's on pictures "made to convey visual information": "the story of prints is not, as many people seem to think, that of a minor art form but that of a most powerful method of communication." 59 But the point is applicable to prints in all fields. Nevertheless, it is true that the exact nature and role of non-letterpress material varies from field to field, and interdisciplinary cooperation is especially important for the growth of bibliographical knowledge in this area. Bibliographers must take the broad view, and see their own particular problems of description in the context of non-letterpress description in general, if they are to benefit as fully as possible from relevant advances already made and if they are to produce bibliographies that meet as fully as possible the needs of users from different fields. Allan Stevenson was well aware of the mixed audience he was serving in the Hunt catalogue, and he has a great deal to say about the use of his catalogue by botanists and students of the graphic arts as well as by collectors and other bibliographers. "Those parts of the description are most successful," he says, "which prove of value to the botanist and these others at one and the same time" (p. cxciii). Or, as he puts it more succinctly, "Bibliography prefers to serve not one but all." In order to do that, all must cooperate, and Stevenson expresses the hope that bibliographers and scientists will "agree to use their special funds of experience and information to the common end of good descriptions." All who deal with the history of books, regardless of the field, do of course have common goals, and all their work is interrelated. The study of non-letterpress material in books provides a particularly forceful illustration of this basic point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For a full discussion, see Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), esp. pp. 40-108, 393-426; and G. T. Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 17-66. 2 As opposed to plates, or other illustrations, that individual owners have had bound into books. A descriptive bibliography is normally concerned with the printing and publication history of books, not with the subsequent alterations made by owners in particular copies. Of course, a bibliographical catalogue of a single collection is necessarily concerned with particular copies and may provide full descriptions of them; some "extra-illustrated" copies are in fact of great interest and are well worth describing in detail. 3 For a useful survey of the field, with many references to the earlier literature, see Robert W. Karrow, Jr., "Cartobibliography," AB Bookman's Yearbook , 1976, 1:43-52. The pioneer is usually considered to be Herbert George Fordham, who in 1901 set forth his methods for dealing with maps of Hertfordshire in the Transactions of the Hertfordshire Natural History Society and then printed a revised version in Studies in Carto-Bibliography, British and French, and in the Bibliography of Itineraries and Road-Books (1914) as the fifth chapter, "Descriptive Catalogues of Maps: Their Arrangement, and the Details They Should Contain" (pp. 92-118). In his recommendations for descriptions with "full detail," he recognized the importance of watermarks, and he specified that the book from which a map "is taken or with which it was published should be fully noted" (p. 99). R.A. Skelton, in Decorative Printed Maps of the 15th to 18th Centuries (1952), states that the "terms used in carto-bibliography . . . differ from those of book-bibliography" (p. 4), and his summary is based on the practice of the British Museum map catalogue, although he must admit, "There is no general agreement on the use of the terms 'issue' and 'edition' when applied to maps." Nearly two decades later Skelton could still say that "the sooner we have a common language of analysis, identification, and description in which to speak to one another, the better"; see his Maps: A Historical Survey of Their Study and Collecting (1972), esp. pp. 103-105. In the same year as Verner's essay, David Woodward remarked that carto-bibliography was "still in its infancy" and that it "does not yet even have established definitions of the terms used" (p. 113); see "The Study of the History of Cartography: A Suggested Framework," American Cartographer , 1 (1974), 101-115. 4 Two years later, in his summation at the 1976 ACRL Rare Books and Manuscripts Preconference, Verner mentioned Karrow's statement (in the paper cited in note 3 above) that the methods and terms of descriptive bibliography are applicable to maps and then added: "As a sometime cartobibliographer my first inclination is to support that position, yet the more I play at studying maps the more I come to realize that similarity does not justify an assumption of identicalness" ( AB Bookman's Yearbook , 1976, 1:71-72). He is unfortunately correct when he goes on to say that bibliographers sometimes "tend to shun the maps contained in the books they describe" (although I would say they do so for different reasons from the ones Verner implies). 5 This is not intended as a comprehensive definition. I have attempted such a definition in "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State " (see note 1 above), p. 65. The definitions set forth there are printed in shorter form in Bibliographic Description of Rare Books (Library of Congress Office for Descriptive Cataloging Policy, 1981), pp. 61-62. 6 Verner seems not to understand fully the two definitions he cites. He quotes McKerrow's definition as "'the whole number of copies of a book printed at any one time or times from one setting-up of type.'" He then says that "Bowers expands this to include '. . . all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.'" Bowers's statement, however, does not expand or enlarge the definition; it is more precise and explicit than McKerrow's, but it coincides with McKerrow's perfectly. 7 Even so, neither "plate" nor "plates" seems a satisfactory collective noun to equate with "edition." 8 Or from substitutes for those formes, such as stereotype plates or photographic negatives. 9 An indication of the difficulty of comprehending this passage is afforded by the fact that this definition of "edition" is attributed to Skelton. Yet two sentences earlier Skelton's use of the term was apparently rejected: "By Skelton's definition . . . edition is synonymous with state as defined herein and is therefore redundant." 10 But not always: differences in inking, for example, or foreign matter on the type forme at the time of printing might create different states in the printed product, without reflecting differences in the type itself. 11 The ISBD (CM): International Standard Bibliographic Description for Cartographic Materials (1977) makes provision for "multi-level description," one level relating to the entire book, another to the individual maps. (Its focus, of course, is library cataloguing, not full-scale bibliographical description.) 12 Verner's final comment on "state" is hard to comprehend, especially in light of the fact that he accepts the term as a useful one in carto-bibliography. A paragraph headed " Variant state " reads: "Like the term issue , the term variant state has a very precise meaning in bibliographical description for which there is no equivalent in carto-bibliography, consequently the term variant state should not be used with reference to maps" (p. 86). What distinction he is making between "state" and "variant state" is difficult to see: there is no need to use the word "state" in the first place unless some difference is involved, and thus a state is by definition "variant" from another state. 13 He then lists two exceptions: when "plate wear has caused imperfect printing" (although, he points out, this process is so "gradual" that it does not "permit the assignment of the precise time the particular copy was pulled"), and when "dated watermarks in the paper show a sequence of printing over time." Both these kinds of evidence are tricky; and in any case the determination of "a sequence of printing over time" or "the precise time" when a copy was printed—obviously valuable information to establish—is not the same thing as assigning copies to discrete printings. 14 He adds that normal plate wear is "not considered to be a change in the plate," although evidence of wear "would be noted when appropriate." One can agree that normal wear does not necessarily produce a state, but it would be unfortunate if his discussion were taken to mean that states can be produced only by intentional action, for they can also result from accidents to which a plate is subjected. 15 Some differences might result from the process of printing. Cf. the discussion of "variant copy" that follows. 16 This problem is concisely illustrated by a passage in another of Verner's papers, "Carto-Bibliography," Western Association of Map Libraries Information Bulletin , 7, no. 2 (March 1976), 31-38. In a brief section on description, he says: "Although the description is derived from a printed map it is actually the plate from which the copy was printed that is being described. This is done indirectly, of course, since the plate itself can be studied only through an examination of the impressions pulled from it" (p. 35). (This paper is reprinted, slightly revised, as "The Study of Early Printed Maps" in AB Bookman's Weekly , 58 [12 July 1976], 194, 198, 200, 202-204, 206.) 17 A more puzzling, but less significant, question is why Verner felt the need to define "change" as a technical term, and one applicable only to maps: he had already defined "state" and indeed had said there that its use in letterpress description essentially coincided with its use in carto-bibliography. 18 As when he says that edition is "determined by one thing only— the imprint " (p. 88). He devotes a chapter to matters of "Cartographic Nomenclature" (pp. 83-89). 19 And before his earlier article on "Criteria for Classifying Hand-Printed Books as Issues and States," PBSA , 41 (1947), 271-292. 20 Krummel is said on the title page to have "compiled" the work, and he asserts in his "Acknowledgments" that the book should be "viewed as a group effort." Nevertheless, he is responsible for the final form of the text; and the section on terminology that is to be discussed here is one that he explicitly accepts more responsibility for (in that section, he says, "I will concede to having pressed the case for several favorite interpretations"). 21 This position had previously been supported in general terms by some prominent writers on music bibliography. C. B. Oldman, for instance, in "Collecting Musical First Editions," New Paths in Book Collecting , ed. John Carter (1934), pp. 93-124, says that, although some modification of the usage of book collectors may be unavoidable, "there seems no justification for any radical departure from current usage" (p. 105). Cecil Hopkinson, in "The Fundamentals of Music Bibliography," Journal of Documentation , 11 (1955), 119-129 (reprinted in Readings in Descriptive Bibliography , ed. John Bush Jones [1974], pp. 57-70), asks whether the descriptive bibliography of music is "the same as that of books," and he answers, "I cannot see that it differs greatly" (p. 120 [58]). (Contrast the report of the panel discussion led by Hopkinson, "Towards a Definition of Certain Terms in Musical Bibliography," in Music, Libraries, and Instruments , ed. Unity Sherrington and Guy Oldham [1961], pp. 147-155, where Richard S. Hill is said to have favored "a more adult approach to music-bibliography . . . as he was fearful of it becoming far too much like book-bibliography"—because musicians are "not interested in variants of a typographical nature" [p. 152]. O. E. Deutsch also took the position that terms from letterpress bibliography are not appropriate for music [p. 149]. In a significant earlier article, "Music Bibliographies and Catalogues," Library , 4th ser., 23 [1942-43], 151-170, Deutsch had said that music books "are in many respects more closely allied to maps than to type-set books" [p. 151].) 22 The wisdom of saying "the same printing surfaces" can be questioned. For example, copies printed from standing type and from stereotype plates made from that type are parts of the same edition, but two different printing surfaces are involved. What links such copies (or others produced by offset from them) is that they all reproduce the results of a single act of typesetting. One should probably refer, therefore, to acts of typesetting, engraving, and so on. 23 That is, in this sense. "Plate" is of course commonly used as a collective noun when referring to pieces of silverplate and could be similarly used for a group of copper-plates or stereotype plates. 24 Cf. note 5 above. 25 The use of "re-issue" here could also be refined. The item is a reissue from the point of view of the publication history of each of the individual selections: part of the edition of each of the selections was reissued in the composite volume. But that volume of selections as an entity had not appeared before, and therefore the volume itself is not a reissue. 26 Krummel glosses this sentence in his "Supplement to the Guide for Dating Early Published Music," Fontes artis musicae , 24 (1977), 175-184: "It should be understood that the word 'text' here refers to a physical presentation . . . but not necessarily a different content" (p. 176). 27 The same point is made again when the term "version" (referring to the "content" of a work) is introduced for the use of editors: "Different versions may be manifest in different editions or states, but rarely in different issues" (p. 48). 28 In discussing issue earlier, he claims that "most re-issues of music are the result of a new printing of copies" (p. 31). 29 The next paragraph, analyzing another example, cites the following among the characteristics producing a "new issue": "Title-page references changed," "New prices, engraved," "New street addresses," "New publisher." Impression is not mentioned; but if any of the changes mentioned coincided with a new impression, they would not be signs of issue , unless one defines issue in such a way that it subsumes impression . 30 In Krummel's impressive survey of the various physical aspects of musical documents and prints, "Musical Functions and Bibliographical Forms," Library , 5th ser., 31 (1976), 327-350, there is a section on engraved editions that continues to refer to "standard edition-issue-state-impression terminology" (p. 337). (He adds that his discussion of these matters in the Guide was "greeted with a mixture of indifference and hostility." The Guide , he continues, "offers nothing more than a sketchy outline for a bibliographical method appropriate to published music since 1700.") 31 The inclusion of the phrase "earliest copy" is questionable. Although one is interested in the earliest form of a publication, one must also—as a historian—be interested in every other form, so long as it is a form put on sale by the producer or publisher and not a form put together by someone else after publication. Two pages later Krummel defines "earliest copy" as "a hypothetical copy which was printed as part of the first impression and offered for sale on the very day of publication," and he then adds that this idea is "a counterpart to the general bibliographer's concept of 'ideal copy.'" But ideal copy refers not simply to the earliest published form but to any published form—as opposed to forms produced, by accident or design, in the course of the post-publication history of the copies. (Cf. note 54 below.) 32 This is not the place to present detailed definitions of these terms. Their signification should in fact be evident from the foregoing discussion; and full definitions can be found in print in the Bowers and Tanselle works cited in note 1 above. 33 Just as the context will normally indicate whether "plate" is being used to refer to the printed impression or to the engraved plate itself—though to avoid possible ambiguity, "copperplate" or simply "copper" should be used in the latter instance. (On this and related matters I have benefited from discussions with Thomas V. Lange.) 34 Printings are often, but by no means always, labeled for what they are or readily distinguishable by date or other prominent feature. In any case, since printing subsumes issue in the classification, the determination of separate printings takes precedence over the establishment of characteristics of issue. A new printing is regarded bibliographically as a discrete group of copies representing a publishing decision, even when it is not easily distinguishable from the preceding printing and when the publisher is not taking a different approach to the marketing of the work. Bibliographers must be concerned with both production and publication history, as the terms printing and issue suggest; that a given group of copies comes from a separate press run is a basic physical fact that is unavoidably a fact of publication history as well. (There are instances when it is more difficult to accommodate printing and publishing history at the same time, as when duplicate sets of stereotype plates produce separate, but simultaneous, sequences of printings. For such situations, James L. W. West III has suggested the term "plating," falling between edition and printing in the hierarchy; he is presently doing further work on this concept, which he introduced in William Styron: A Descriptive Bibliography [1977], where he attributes the idea to Joseph Katz. For some further comments on this general problem, see my discussion of Bowers's term "subedition," in "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State " [note 1 above], pp. 57-62.) 35 "Bibliography—An Apologia," Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932-33), 113-143; reprinted in his Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 239-266. The discussion of illustrations from which the quotations here are drawn is on pp. 117-118 (243-244). 36 He says that "All illustrations are of course recorded in the list of contents" (p. lxiv); but they are not described because his practice is to reproduce most of them in his section of plates. However, states of engravings "are described so far as they have been ascertained" (p. lxxii). (See also pp. xlviii, cxxxiv, and cxliv.) Because inserted plates occur infrequently in the books Greg describes, he did not find it confusing to include references to them in his signature collations, even though the method he used (e.g., "C3+1") is the same as that employed for letterpress insertions. 37 He also treats engraved title pages very briefly (p. 76), suggesting that the engraved part be identified by a reference to a published illustration or described in the notes at the end of the whole description. 38 Depending on whether signature or page references are used elsewhere in the description. For modern books page numbers may prove more convenient (see p. 446). 39 As Bowers points out, engraved leaves or folds that were also put through the printing press to receive letterpress would qualify for inclusion in the signature collation. 40 He also introduces a convenient device of using the Greek letter lambda (followed by a plate number) to "signify an unsigned, unpaged leaf of letterpress opposite (or associated with) a plate" (p. cxlvii). 41 Particularly, one may suspect, for someone like Stevenson, who was not a botanist. 42 Further discussion of analytical and descriptive bibliography supported by the Hunt Botanical Library includes Ian MacPhail's "An Introduction to Bibliography for Botanists," Huntia , 1 (1964), 103-115. See also W. D. Margadant, "Descriptive Bibliography Applied to Botany," in Early Bryological Literature (1968), pp. 1-33. 43 "The Treatment of Plates in Bibliographical Description," Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History , 7, part 4 (1976), 469-488. 44 Cf.

John Bush Jones (1974), pp. 42-56. 45 Bridson says, "It is essential that a bibliographical description of a plate should enable a distant reader to make a critical comparison with his own copy of a book, a situation that letterpress bibliography already fulfils" (p. 474). Although this statement is overly sanguine about the accomplishments of letterpress bibliography, the general approach it endorses is obviously to be encouraged. 46 This practice would be useful, for instance, in a case where one picture replaces another as the illustration for a particular quotation from the work being illustrated. 47 "The bibliographer," in his words, "needs to be able to describe some of the elements of syntax involved in making different processes of printed picture as well as being able to describe the graphic medium" (p. 473). One should consult Bridson for a concise listing of some of the variations in the ways etchings or lithographs or photoengravings can be produced, and for citations of books that may be of help with this matter (pp. 482-483).

T. Tanselle, "The Concept of Ideal Copy ," SB , 33 (1980), 18-53. 55 Especially since the production of plates sometimes fell behind the production of letterpress, and the plates therefore did not always relate to the text in the same fascicle. 56 For an excellent description of a botanical plate book in fascicles, see Günther Buchheim, "A Bibliographical Account of L'Héritier's Stirpes novae ," Huntia , 2 (1965), 29-58. See also Ian MacPhail, "Titford's Hortus botanicus americanus ," Huntia , 1 (1964), 117-135. 57 When the plates are not numbered, one can give only a bracketed total—e.g., "plates [5] (B2 v , B6. . .)"—as Bowers explains on p. 288. 58 A similar point could be made about typography and lettering, although it is complicated by the fact that some letterpress can appear on the same page as an engraving. But should the hand lettering in an engraved plate (transcribed as part of the contents of the plate) be described in the account of plates or in the paragraph on typography (enlarged to include lettering)? 59 Prints and Visual Communication (1953), p. 158.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Editing of Folio Romeo and Juliet by S. W. Reid</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few plays in the First Folio of Shakespeare appear to have received less editorial supervision from Heminge and Condell than Romeo and Juliet . Although the authoritative second quarto is sometimes regarded as one of the less satisfactory so-called "good" quartos, responsible scholarship has found no reason to believe that Heminge and Condell, or their agents, felt obliged to bring the text of its descendant, Q3, into conformity with a playhouse manuscript in order to have F1 represent the "True Originall"—as they frequently did with other quartos that provided Folio copy. Sir Walter Greg summed up the matter in 1955 as follows: "Q2 was reprinted in 1609 and from this third quarto F was set up without material alteration. There is no evidence that the copy was ever compared with a playhouse manuscript; indeed it certainly was not, for any such comparison must have left apparent traces. Nor can the quarto have been conceivably used as a prompt-book. . . . Italic for the Nurse's part was finally discarded. The stage-directions were slightly revised, sometimes intelligently, sometimes not; there is nothing to suggest that this was done anywhere but in the printing-house." He documents these conclusions by noting that "at IV.v.103 [tln 2680] 'Enter Will Kemp' is replaced by 'Enter Peter' in accordance with the prefixes. V.iii.71 [2924] is recognized as a speech and given to Peter, in accordance with the direction at l. 22 [2874], but there Peter is an error for Balthasar, and in fact the speaker is Paris's Page. Prefixes ('Nurse') are given to the marginal calls of 'Madam' at II.ii.149 and 151 [952, 954], and the muddled prefix 'Watch boy' at V.iii.171 [3036] is corrected to 'Boy'." Otherwise he finds that "the only differences appear to be" some eighteen changes in stage-directions, "apart from purely formal alterations." Greg's view of the matter has, predictably, been followed by a variety of subsequent scholars. 1 Greg's verdict on the Folio text of Romeo and Juliet (despite his reference to "the printing-house") would seem to receive some support from other plays in the volume, which generally exhibit variants from their quarto copy that are more striking either individually or as a group. But his argument for Rom. itself rests on the evidence of F1's errors of omission—the failure to alter the erroneous entry at 2069 (III.v) —or of commission—the replacing of the erroneous ' Enter Romeo' "by the equally erroneous 'Enter Servant'" (I.v. tln 568), the deficient exit introduced at 1309 (II.iv), the wrong speech-prefix added at 2924 (V.iii), the unnecessary deletion of ' manet ' at 2675 (IV.v). 2 Both ranges of evidence of course entail Greg's usual hypothesis that such inconsistencies must have been resolved in the prompt-book, and both depend directly for their worth on the validity of this hypothesis. 3 The evidential basis for his conclusions is obviously not as broad as might be hoped. Also causing some uncertainty about his assessment are two facts that have come to light since Greg wrote: (1) the "newly corrected, augmented, and amended" Q4 was printed before November of 1622, and (2) most of Folio Rom. was typeset by the least capable of Jaggard's workmen, Compositor E. 4 Neither of these discoveries is so revolutionary by itself as to overturn Greg's verdict, however unsure its foundations, that the Folio is not dependent on the prompt-book. Yet examination of their possible implications reveals that the changes introduced in the Folio sometimes agree with certain readings of Q4 and Q1 and thus seem to suggest that F1 is somehow related to one or both of them, but that nevertheless Q3 alone provided printed copy for F1; that these changes could not have originated with the compositors; and that consequently we are left with several explanations of their origin which, though not necessarily irreconcilable with one another, are unanticipated in Greg's conclusions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The dating of Q4 has led one recent editor to conclude that it was the source of "a number of passages" found in the Folio. 5 Indeed since Romeo and Juliet went through the press during the spring of 1623 (Hinman, I, 363-365; II, 513-529), the fact that Q4 had been printed by the end of the previous year raises the possibility that it, rather than Q3, actually provided copy for the Folio. The possibility is attractive because it would bring Rom. under Greg's general observation that "in most cases the particular edition used as copy was what may be assumed to have been the latest available at the time of preparation" (p. 159), and also would explain a number of agreements between Q4 and F1 that are not readily attributable to independent compositorial correction of Q3. In fact, however, another explanation for the concurrences of Q4 and F1 must be sought, for the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that Q3 indeed served as Folio copy. The evidence consists not only of errors shared by Q3 and F1 as against Q4, but also of those changes in F1 traceable directly to Q3's faults. A few of these faults have a typographical origin. The most interesting is in Juliet's speech at the end of IV.i, where the Folio has her take Friar Lawrence's potion with the line 'Give me, give me, O tell me not ofcare' (2416). Here Q2 and Q4-5 have the correct 'of feare', whereas Q3 has 'off eare'. This reading is obviously due to the absence of spacing material in the type that printed some copies, at least, of Q3, and either Compositor E or some other agent has taken it to be an example of foul case and variant spelling ( of / off ) 6 and has made a plausible though wrong "correction." A somewhat similar instance is found in Juliet's last speech: Q2's 'This is thy sheath, there rust and let me dye' is corrupted by Q3 to 'Tis is', restored to 'This is' by Q4, but further altered to ''Tis in' by F1 (3035). Q3's omission of the - h - may have been caused by the compositor's fiddling around with the line to accommodate a turn-up from the long verse line that follows, 7 but at any rate this Q3 error has parallels in several other readings. In one case Q2's 'turnes' becomes Q3's grammatically undesirable 'turne', and F1 corrects to 'turn'd' (and, incidentally, reconciles this by making the 'becomes' &gt; 'became' change at 1956), while Q4 simply restores Q2's form (1957). A few lines later (1961), the Q2-3 'puts up' (an error presumably for 'puts upon') appears in F1 as the awkward but metrically improved 'puttest up' and in Q4 as 'powts upon'. This pattern is repeated in the Q2-3 omission at 2380, where Q4 inserts 'shroud' and F1 the less imaginative and repetitive 'grave', and in the ambiguous abbreviation 'L.' at 951, which Q4 expands to 'Love' and F1 to 'Lord'. The same pattern of compound variation may be found in the speech-prefix at 2087, where Q2-3's incorrect ' Ro. ' becomes ' Ju. ' in Q4 but ' Juilet. ' in F1; though substantively identical (even with Q3, which has ' Ju. ' as a catchword), the different forms suggest F1's independence of Q4, since Compositor E is obviously reproducing (with a typical transposition) the form he found in his copy. (More on this point later.) Finally, there are the well-known cruces involving the assignment of speeches—the lines which close II.ii and open II.iii and the 'O Godigoden' speech in III.v (992-998, 999-1009, 2215-19). In all three cases the differences between Q4 and Q3 are unmistakable, and in all three F1 has accepted the Q2-3 readings whereas Q4 has altered them. The relatively numerous and persuasive examples of compound variation combine with these significant differences and with the more numerous instances of common error to show F1's derivation from Q3 independently of Q4. For two reasons this conclusion must stand despite the fact that the Folio and Q4 agree against Q3 in having readings that are about as numerous as those just cited, though not so significant. 8 Aside from the usual agreements traceable to obvious correction or fortuitous identical variation, Q4 and F1 have in common some twenty identical readings that vary from their mutual copy, Q3. Several of these involve the Folio alterations that Greg cites—e.g., the substitution of ' Peter ' for ' Will Kempe ' and of ' Boy ' for ' Watch boy ', and the righting of the redundant stage-directions in the last scene (2680, 3036, 3061, 3074+1). To these conspicuous changes may be added another speech-prefix and several perceptive corrections of dialogue that are common to F1 and Q4. 9 Most of these alterations represent intelligent attempts to remedy the defects of Q3 and would appear to be beyond the several compositors, particularly since those in F1 were typeset by the otherwise deficient E. Yet it is their very nature that makes them suspect as evidence of F1's dependence on Q4. As McKerrow some time ago pointed out, "it is a general rule that the less significant the readings varied are, from a literary point of view, the greater is their weight as evidence of the genetic relationships of the texts in which they occur." 10 As attempts to improve Q3, rather than common errors, the agreements of Q4 and F1 are much too significant (in McKerrow's terms) to establish the derivation of the 1623 Folio from the 1622 quarto, for the alternative explanation that they originated independently with the respective editors is equally plausible—or rather (as will emerge shortly) more plausible, in view of all the other changes introduced in F1 independently of Q4. There is still another reason these twenty or so readings cannot counterbalance the weightier evidence already discussed. Since the Folio "corrections" traceable to Q3's typographical faults make it clear that an example of this quarto served as copy in Jaggard's shop, any argument for F1's dependence on Q4 would have to explain why he would have used this "newly corrected, augmented, and amended" quarto only sporadically in combination with Q3, when it would have been more convenient and more sensible to use Q4 alone as copy. Under ordinary circumstances, McKerrow's theory of dual copy—according to which "the master printer might have copies of the two preceding editions and it might be convenient to give one to each of the compositors to work from" (p. 105)—would admirably suit a book generally set up, at any given time, by two men working more or less simultaneously. But the "intercalary" formes of Rom. were typeset by only one workman at a time, almost always Compositor E. Moreover, such a practice as McKerrow envisages should have produced some sort of bibliographical pattern in the Folio's readings; but there is none discernible in its agreements with Q4, which are on the whole isolated ones scattered throughout the play. The only alternative to the theory of dual copy is to postulate consultation of Q4. By nature this theory is open-ended and difficult to test, since almost any instance of lack of agreement between F1 and Q4 is easily justified by an appeal to the concept of occasional use which is basic to the theory. However, conflicting evidence of positive disagreement does arise whenever—as in the instances first cited—the supposedly dependent F1 deliberately changes a Q3 reading but in doing so ignores the acceptable solution present in Q4. The only way to explain such conflicting evidence is to make a second postulate—viz., that the Folio editor sometimes supplied alterations independently of Q4 instead of consulting it. Yet each time such an independent change occurs, the second postulate increasingly gains strength, until it alone is sufficient to account for all the non-compositorial alterations in F1, whether or not they appear in Q4. On the premise that unity of reading necessarily implies unity of source, one could just as well argue that Jaggard's shop consulted the 1597 "bad quarto," behind which presumably lies a report of some sort of recollected performance. 11 As a matter of fact, the agreements between these two texts as against Q3 are more diverse and substantial than those between Q4 and F1, ranging as they do from several of the Folio stage-directions and speech-prefixes that Greg cites—e.g., the identical entrances for ' Tybalt ', ' Mother ', and ' Appothecarie ' (1556, 2592, 2785)—through essential concurrence in directions like ' Exit. Mercutio, Benvolio ' at 1242 (Q1: ' Exeunt Benvolio, Mercutio '), to numerous agreements in speech assignments and the wording of dialogue, all of which differ from Q3's readings. Indeed, F1's use of Q1 might explain some, though by no means all, of the agreements between F1 and Q4, since a few editors believe that Q4 "habitually consulted" Q1. 12 Still, the conflicting evidence of deliberate Folio alterations made independently of Q1 is equally substantial as that for F1's dependence on Q1, and even if one were to follow the consultation theory to its illogical end and postulate the Folio's use of both Q4 and Q1, such independent Folio alterations would remain to be explained. Here one may well paraphrase Greg (p. 160): we may claim the right to prefer probabilities to possibilities, simpler hypotheses to complex ones, and to hope that people performed their tasks in a more or less reasonable fashion. It goes without saying that had Heminge and Condell or any other playhouse editor consulted a document, it would have been a playhouse manuscript rather than another print. Moreover, the notion that Jaggard would have used another quarto to supplement Q3 raises a vexing question about his motivation for doing so, when generally he seems to have relied on Shakespeare's company to provide suitable copy. Such consultation of another quarto to supplement the Q3 copy approved by Heminge and Condell is quite a different matter from earlier printers' supposed use of bad quartos as an aid when setting from foul-papers. And the Folio's agreements with Q4 and Q1 in its attempts to improve Q3's text belong to an entirely different order of evidence from, for instance, the typography of the Nurse's speeches which presumably links Q1 and Q2 Rom. or the variable indention of speech-prefixes on the second page of Q2 Hamlet , which are apparently traceable to the inner and outer formes of Q1. We must have grounds more relative than such agreements in reading to establish the Folio's dependence on either Q4 or Q1. There can be no reasonable doubt that Q3 alone served as printed copy for Folio Romeo and Juliet . The conclusion must follow that the source of the alterations introduced in F1 is to be sought in the Folio's own transmission process, despite its interesting agreements with both Q4 and Q1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The implications of this conclusion are naturally of considerable interest for the Folio, especially since all but one and one-half of its pages were typeset by Compositor E. If a copy of Q3, and not Q4, lies behind the Folio and if F1 nevertheless contains a number of variants that agree either with the reported text of Q1 (which, especially in its stage-directions, presumably represents a theatrical tradition of some kind), or with the apparently "edited" Q4 (which may or may not have consulted Q1 at a given point), or with both, then the question remains of the origin of the Folio's changes, which in fact are not unlike those that it introduces in other quarto plays. The two traditional responses would credit the prompt-book, against the considered judgment of generations of critics, or blame the compositors. The former is perhaps debatable at this point and cannot, in any case, be discussed until the compositorial alterations are factored out. As for the latter, invoking the Folio compositors simply will not work as an explanation in Romeo and Juliet . It might go to explain some of the more imaginative changes in the first page of the play, set up by B, if the traditional view of this workman were followed. 13 However, it will not explain similar alterations throughout the remainder of the play, set by the less competent E, nor the curious evidence of the last part-page, which was reset by B at a later time. Altogether there are, by conservative estimate, some seventy such alterations, the majority of them in the stage-directions and speech-prefixes but many in the dialogue as well, and they are often found elsewhere than in the attempts to correct Q3's errors and in the agreements with Q1 and Q4 so far discussed. We have yet much to learn about Compositor E (and Compositor B), but whether or not we identify him as the apprentice John Leason who joined Jaggard in 1622, we can all agree, I suppose, that his work on Tit. and Rom. was subject to unusual scrutiny in the proofreading, that he was incapable of performing certain elementary compositorial tasks satisfactorily, and that many of the changes introduced in Folio Rom. would appear to be beyond either his powers or his experience. 14 Furthermore, whatever his capacities, the mode of operation that he was forced to adopt effectively thwarted any ability or inclination he may have had to improve the play while setting it. Hinman has shown that E's role, at least early in his work on the Tragedies, 15 was that of a substitute for the regular compositors (B and generally A), who were engaged in setting other plays from manuscript. When either workman was called away, E was to step in at the vacant cases and set up a portion of Tit. or Rom. in order to keep the printing of the Folio going forward. His work on Rom. was, therefore, very intermittent, and discontinuity was even greater than that normally occasioned by the alternation back and forth between various parts of the plays caused by setting by formes. This discontinuity was augmented in the first third of Rom. by the fact that four of the pages in quire ee (sig. ee5-6 v , tln 493-1016) shared formes with the last four pages of Tit. and that consequently E was here alternating between two plays. 16 The same was true to some extent in the one-sheet quire gg. There current gg2 v was originally a forme-mate of cancelled *gg5, which contained part of Tro. , and the cancellation of this play caused a particularly long delay between E's composition of *gg2 v ( gg2 v ) and of its eventual forme-mate gg1, though continuity appears to have held in the setting up of gg1 v :2. Yet even in those formes not experiencing this kind of alternation between plays, the delay and discontinuity that plagued E's work was enough to disorient a more accomplished and experienced typesetter. In quire ff, for instance, which contains Acts II, III, and IV of Rom. , E set the formes in "normal" order (i.e., from the inside, ff3 v :4, out); yet he had to contend not only with the normal disorientation in the first half of the quire caused by setting these portions of the play in reverse order, but also with the discontinuities occasioned by delays: between ff6 and ff6 v , for example, six formes of R3 and H8 set by B and others went through the press, by Hinman's calculations (II, 220-234), and it was thus about three days that E was away from the cases and from Rom. before resuming composition (with ff1 presumably). 17 These severe handicaps together with the weaknesses exhibited in his early work make it difficult to believe that many of the Folio's changes which aim at improving Q3's text originated with the main compositor of Rom. , the tyro E. These changes, which must therefore represent annotation of Q3 copy, include but go beyond those listed by Greg (p. 235). One added stage-direction, noted by Greg, appears in the ninth line of gg1, which E set up after the protracted delay occasioned by the setting and cancellation of part of Tro. , about a week after he had completed ff6 v and after he had composed what would have been the two last pages of Rom. and the first four of Tro . 18 This is the re-entry ' Enter Mother ' (2592) omitted in Q2-3 and also in the intelligently edited Q4, which presumably failed to consult Q1 (which has it) or to notice independently that an entrance was required for the subsequent speaker. Indeed, the complicated and quick action—which involves entrances and departures of Capulet, Lady Capulet, and the Nurse, as well as the business of music and servants with logs and baskets—is enough to elude an editor reading consecutively. E, however, began his setting of gg1 in the middle of Q3's sig. K2; for him to have comprehended the action, we must suppose that he not only read through the facing page K1 v , where Lady Capulet appears in the stage-directions and speech-prefixes in her alternate function as ' Lady ' (' La. '), but also leafed back to I4 v and K1 to get the full sequence of action, where she appears as ' Mother ' (' Mo. '). 19 This entry is the only change introduced in this page of Q3, and to argue that E made it independently and thus alone amongst the reprints provided for this entrance is to attribute to him a comprehension of the action of the play matched only by the actor-reporters of Q1. Another interesting re-entry cited by Greg is that for Tybalt, which E sets early in column a of ff3 (1556); it pairs with the ' Exit Tybalt ' that F1 substitutes for Q2-3's unusual ' Away T ibalt' (1522). E would have begun setting ff3 with tln 1542 on Q3's F4, and unless he looked across to F3 v and read through it in order to gain a sense of the continuity of the action, he would not have had the opportunity to understand the flow of the staging until at least a day later, when he returned to set up ff2 v , working his way from Q3's sig. F2 up through its F4. To argue that in fact E did both these things is, as is often the case, to argue that he took more care with and made better sense of the play than the editor of Q4, who failed to mend Q3's ambiguously centered words (either to an exit or a speech 20 ) and to provide a re-entry, in spite of the fact that Q1 does both. A third example comes to hand in the two expanded exits at 2465 and 2477 (IV.ii), which show great pains in specifying the departures of ' Juliet and Nurse ' and later ' Father and Mother ', though failing to do so for the ' two or three ' servingmen that also appear in the scene. Both directions occur early in column a of ff6 v ; E began setting this page with the last two lines of Q3's sig. I4, which also contains the centered entry for all the characters but Juliet (2423-24), whose entrance is provided in a rather hidden direction sandwiched between long lines of dialogue (2438). Between the time he set these entries in sig. ff6 and added the specifics for the exits in sig. ff6 v , some six formes went through the press in the course of about three days' work, before E returned to Rom. by setting up forme-mate ff1 and then ff6 v . Hence, unless we suppose that he deliberately reread the rest of sig. I4 prior to setting its last two lines and digested them so thoroughly as to introduce the two sets of characters in the subsequent directions—where even the intelligently edited Q4 is satisfied with Q3's simple ' Exeunt ' at 2465 (despite the ' Exeunt Nurse and Juliet ' of Q1) and with changing its ' Exit ' to ' Exeunt ' at 2477 (more or less in accord with Q1)—we have to assume that these additions to Q3 represent annotations of a Folio editor. Similar specification occurs halfway down column a of ff2 in the Folio's addition of ' Nurse and Peter ' to Q3's ' Exit ' (1309), which Q4 again found satisfactory even though Q1 offers a complete account of the departures—including Romeo's, which, as Greg points out, F1 fails to provide for. In this case, of course, E was to begin setting the preceding page (ff1 v ) four formes later and would have had to read not only the rest of Q3's E4—where he began with the short penultimate speech toward the bottom (1280)—but E3 v as well and also would have then had to decide that Q3's ' Exeunt ' at 1242 referred to both Mercutio and Benvolio, altering that stage-direction to read ' Exit . Mercutio, Benvolio ' (substantially with Q1) when he returned to set it two days later. In this as well as the other cases, E faced considerable discontinuity owing to the mode in which he worked, and if we are to assign the Folio's alterations to him we must postulate his habitual reading of earlier pages of Q3 and attribute to him a comprehension of the play comparable to that of the Q1 reporters and exceeding that of the Q4 editor, who had the presumed advantages of working through Q3 consecutively and (perhaps) of consulting Q1. This hypothesis, or set of hypotheses, is of course untenable, especially given E's observable failures in other, simpler tasks; and Greg's citations of these Folio alterations are virtual acknowledgements that none of the Folio compositors can be credited with such changes, even if seriatim setting were assumed. 21 Indeed just about all the stage-directions that he cites are open to one or more of the improbabilities so far discussed, if we attempt to trace them elsewhere than to a Folio editor. And this generalization applies to a few that he failed to notice. These must also represent annotation, although one or two that Greg cites are probably the result of compositorial justification. As already suggested, the specification added to Q3's exit at 1309 inevitably involves comprehension of the total scene and identification of the characters at 1242; similar elaborations of a Q3 exit and of a Q3 entry occur elsewhere (2758, 3061, the latter involving the deletion of 3074+1). The gratuitous change 'Romeo' &gt; ' Servant ' at 568 no doubt represents a misunderstanding of Shakespeare's staging and an attempt to clarify it and to provide for the subsequent speaker, but the introduction of ' their ' in the preceding entry (567) shows some detailed attention to the wording that finds a parallel in F1's ' a Servingman ' (446). Somewhat comparable is the substitution of ' Peter ' for ' Will Kempe ' (2680). But the extent to which the annotator is responsible for the alterations of the exits in this part of the play is problematic. The preceding speech-prefix (2679) was also annotated, and all that marking up may have somehow helped distract E from the ' Exeunt omnes ' (2679+1) that appears in the direction line of Q3's K3. Certainly, the earlier omission of ' manet ' (2675) in an exit that also affects this sequence of action is to be put down to E's justification. There is some doubt, too, about part of another stage-direction which Greg mentions, the deletion of Q3's ' or partysons ' at 71: although it could be argued that F1's omission represents a book-keeper's decision on an "indefinite" stage-direction, it might well exhibit anticipatory justification on the part of Compositor B aimed at centering the entry, in accord with his custom. 22 On the other hand, the "imperative" instruction ' Fight ' in the preceding line almost surely represents an annotator, and it finds parallels in the stage-directions at 938, 1881, and 1885 (which Greg cites), at 3035 (which he fails to cite), and at 952 and 954 (which he confuses in a curious way). 23 The Folio editor even exhibits concern with the details of exits. The fairly straightforward ' Exit Tybalt ' &lt; ' Away T ibalt' (1522) must be laid to his charge by virtue of its subtlety, its positioning, and its coordination with Tybalt's later re-entry (see above). There is, though, also some attention to the somewhat formal question of exit/exeunt, which is displayed not only in the otherwise annotated departure at 2477, but at 1643 and 793 as well. This suggests that the added exits at 959, 450, and 330 are also the work of an editor, either because other annotation of the Q3 pages containing them makes insertion of them more probable or because the context requires more attention than we have a right to expect from E. If these stage-directions be acknowledged the work of a Folio editor, rather than Compositor E, then a number of the Folio's speech-prefixes must represent annotation also. Perhaps the clearest example is the series of regularizations in the divertimento between Peter and the musicians in IV.v (2679-2719), where F1 alters to ' Mu. ' Q3's variable ' Min. ' and ' Fid. ' (and their formal variants). The last of these (2719) was set from Q3's K4 and alone appears on gg1 v , which followed gg1 by some five formes (or two and one-half days). That E achieved this kind of uniformity on his own is incredible; the Folio's ' Mu. ' is undoubtedly editorial, being derived from Q3's ' Musi. ' on K3 (at 2676), which E would only have looked at a few days earlier, and the annotations were part of the same process that included the ' Will Kempe ' &gt; ' Peter ' alteration (2680) if not the deletion of Q3's ' Exeunt omnes ' (2679+1). To the editor must also be ascribed the long delayed romanization of the Nurse's speeches, which E first encountered at the top of B4 in Q3 and from then on uniformly altered from its italic, even though in setting the same column of ee4 he followed the italic of Capulet's "letter" as found on Q3's B3 v . 24 No doubt the editor, rather than E, was also responsible for altering line 2924 to a speech, although as Greg remarks Shakespeare's own confusion at 2874 seems to have misled him into assigning it to Peter; this intelligent but probably wrong editing is comparable to the earlier mistreatment of similarly ambiguous words as a stage-direction rather than a speech (at 1522). Certainly the correct assignment to Juliet of the lines which conclude her soliloquy in II.v (1325-30) must be ascribed to an editor, and this finds a parallel not only in Q4's identical change but also at 2087. Here F1, like Q4 (and in accord with Q1), corrects Q3's ' Ro. ' at the top of its sig. H3 v , giving the speech to ' Juilet .' Since Q3's catchword is ' Ju. ' and since the context makes the change relatively self-evident, the assignment itself is of less significance than the form it takes (even though crediting E with the change on these bases would seem unjustified). By and large E is rather faithful in reproducing the form of the speech-prefixes found in Q3, 25 and his only ' Juliet .' in a speech-prefix occurs the second time he sets it (at 359)—under the influence of Q3's first ' Juliet .' two lines earlier and perhaps of the distractions which the annotation of the Nurse's initial speeches might have caused him. In any case it seems probable that the speech-prefix ' Juilet .' represents a reproduction of an editorial notation, the transposition being typical of E's response to marked-up copy at this point in his career (see below). More or less formal concerns are also exhibited at 2221—where F1 makes one attempt at regularizing the "functional" speech-prefixes by altering Q3's ' Wi. ' to ' La. ' in accord with the other speech-prefixes on the page, though ignoring the ' Mo. ' on the following page (2249)—in Compositor B's '2. Wife .' &lt; 'M. Wife 2.' (81), in the addition (also found in Q4) of the fairly obvious prefix for Juliet after her entrance alone (1645), and in the ' Boy. ' &lt; ' Watch boy. ' normalization in the last scene (3036). Particularly interesting is the regularization to ' App. ' of the various Q3 forms (' Appo. ', ' Poti. ', ' Po. '), since all appear to have been coordinate with the addition of the entry at 2785 and since the first (2786) is not really called for and depends on someone desiring to regularize those (2795, 2804, 2806) that occur on the following Q3 page. Q4 follows these various forms, and it seems unlikely that E altered them on his own. The Folio editor, therefore, appears to have been concerned with such matters. He may even be responsible for the mistaken '3. Cap. ' &lt; '1. Capu. ' early in the play (612) and the two curious changes at the end in B's Gg1 (3155, 3146), though these two are rather complex (see discussion below). But apart from these three changes, there is abundant evidence from the regularization of ' Mu. ' &lt; ' Fid. ' (' Min. ') to that of ' App. ' &lt; ' Appo. ' (' Po. ', ' Poti. ') of editorial attention to the speech assignments of the play. Since this is so, it may come as no surprise that there is some evidence of an editor's attention to and annotation of the dialogue itself. Here we are generally on less secure ground, because the context of the dialogue is much sooner grasped by a compositor setting by formes than is that of the action and because the changes themselves are by nature less easily assigned to a particular agent. However, with E's early work we may make some headway in trying to distinguish what can be laid at his door from what must be attributed to annotation. Two of the most helpful examples (495, 763) occur early in his pages ee5 and ee6; each is separated by intervening formes from the preceding page (i.e., ee4 v and ee5 v ) and each follows its intervening forme-mate, ee2 v and ee1 v , both of which contain the end of Tit. In both instances F1 succeeds in mending a subtle Q3 error derived from Q2 in a witty or sophisticated context. In the case of ' Abraham Cupid ' &lt; ' Abraham: Cupid ' (763), the Q4 editor also succeeds in correcting Q3, but at 495 he fails to make F1's generally accepted 'your' &lt; 'you' alteration (Q1 provides neither correction). Moreover, F1's 'Lord' &lt; 'L.' (951) seems to be superior to Q4's 'Love' (Q1: 'Lord'), and the Folio's attempt to deal with the Shakespearian duplication at 1843-45+2, derived from foul papers via Q2, shows attention to the dialogue superior to that exhibited by Q4, which follows Q2-3. 26 In each of these cases we would, I believe, be loathe to credit Compositor E with the alteration. This view of E, which partakes no doubt of some prejudice, finds support in several other instances of change. One is particularly complex and somewhat inferential. It involves F1's curious lines What? in a names that which we call a Rose, By any other word would smell as sweete, (837-838). These famous lines appear correctly in no early text, in the view of most editors, Q1 having 'name' for 'word' but also being the only text to provide the query after the first 'name'. F1's obviously botched line is puzzling, given Q3's basically satisfactory 'What's in a name that . . .', until it is seen to represent an interchange of the '?' and the 's' (both types one-en thick). But, this acknowledged, the question remains how the text came about. Had E recognized what was wanted in the course of setting the lines, his text should have come out right. The explanation appears to lie in a characteristic failure of E's that is exhibited several times in his attempts to introduce proof-corrections, where he seems to have transposed the changes called for, sometimes simply by alternating types. Perhaps the most serious is at Rom. , 348: here E's 'shall scant shell' was marked to be corrected to Q3's 'shall scant shew' but E confused the '-all' and '-ell' letters that follow the identical ligatures and produced the irredeemable nonsense 'shew scant shell,' that now stands in examples of "corrected" ee4. 27 Three other instances exhibit a similar proclivity to interchanging types in response to marked-up print: F1 (u) F1 (c) Rom. 229 wisewi:sely wisewi : sely Rom. 1218 [qua-|] th aGentleman: [qua-|] t ha:Gentlemen, Lr. 1787 skin. so'tis skinso :'tis Although other examples of E's botching annotation might be cited, 28 this particular disposition accounts, I suggest, for F1's curious line, which results from E's characteristic interchange in his attempt to carry out instructions given by the Folio editor in the form of an annotation in his Q3 copy. 29 Other evidence of the editor's annotation of fine points in the dialogue are perhaps less inferential. Certainly F1's unique correction 'here, of' &lt; 'hereof' shows sensitivity to subtleties comparable to that found at 763, as does 'counterfaits a' &lt; 'counterfaits. A', though here Q4's 'counterfeits, a' is comparable (2010, 2170). Of interest, too, is the series of changes in lines 1956-61. Of the five, only 'or' is an outright spontaneous error, perhaps occasioned by the annotation that must have surrounded it. The last, 'puttest up', though wrong, was probably motivated by metrical considerations; Q3 needs correction and F1 does as well here as Q4 ('powts upon'). In the previous line both editors also take Q2-3's 'mishaved' for an error and alter it, F1 with perhaps a little more imagination (F1: 'mishaped'; Q4: 'misbehav'd). They discern that Q3's 'turne' is erroneous, but here Q4 restores Q2's 'turnes' while F1 alters to 'turn'd'; this presumably leads to the Folio change 'becomes' &gt; 'became' in the previous line, which shows some concern with consistency of tenses and can hardly be attributed to E (who would have already completed the line before coming to Q3's 'turne', unless he memorized two lines at a time). The attempt to correct Q3's 'puts up' at 1961 suggests a certain concern with meter, and elsewhere F1's ' Capulets ' (also adopted by the Q4 editor) might yet stand had not Q1 provided the superior ' Capels are' (1433). Two other examples, a little less subtle, occur in ff2 v , where Q3's grammatically satisfactory wording is deliberately altered ('Forbid' &gt; 'Forbidden', 'both houses' &gt; 'both the Houses') to make regular ten-syllable lines (1520, 1524). The even more gratuitous changes at 2153 nevertheless exhibit a similar, albeit misguided, concern with meter ('Shall happly make thee there a joyfull Bride' &gt; 'Shall happily make thee a joyfull Bride'). Mild concern with censorship may be traced in the substitutions for 'zounds' and 'sounds', and this may also account in part for the alteration of the stage-direction ' Slud knocke ' (1480, 1534, 1885). 30 Less easily classified alterations appear elsewhere. In the compound variant at 3035, F1's ''Tis in' makes tolerable sense of Q3's 'Tis is', though Q4 succeeds in restoring Q2's 'This is'; here an editor also added the stage-direction ' Kils herselfe ' and simplified the next speech-prefix to ' Boy. ' (3036). Another example depends on Q3's paging: the addition 'grave' (2380) is not terribly imaginative and could have been made with a glance at the previous line, if that line were not on the previous page of Q3; Q2-3's text makes tolerable sense ('tomb', or Q4's 'shroud', or some other grisly word associated with burial being implied), but its defective meter signals the need for a monosyllable, and the Folio editor, rather than E, appears to have supplied it. Less imaginative but correct alterations are the changes 'Sycamour' &lt; 'Syramour', 'jaunt' &lt; 'jaunce', and 'denote' &lt; 'devote' (123, 1338, 1927). These are all readings adopted by later editors; it may be noticed that Q4 fails to get the first, Q1 and F1 alone providing it. More questionable, indeed gratuitous, changes are found in 'o'th Collar' &lt; 'of choller', 'done' &lt; 'dun', and 'Coarse' &lt; 'course' (9, 492, 1782); though all are wrong (and the last, perhaps, still a mere spelling variation in 1623), they all exhibit some elementary concern with double meanings and a tendency to pin down one of them, and all three find parallels in either Q4 or Q1. Other examples of Folio changes of Q3 dialogue might be brought forward: for instance, the oxymoron created by 'fire' &lt; 'life' is difficult to attribute to E because it produces a highly conceited reading and represents a conscious attempt to improve Q3's quite acceptable passage (2497). But from the evidence just cited it would seem plain that the Folio's text exhibits a rather surprising attention to its dialogue, particularly since all but one (tln 9) of these thirty or so instances occur in the work of Compositor E.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III If such editorial annotation of Q3's stage-directions, speech-prefixes, and dialogue took place, then several questions about the treatment of the play as a whole arise. One is rather specific and concerns the relining of verse and the alterations from verse to prose or from prose to verse. Such changes are numerous in Folio Romeo and Juliet . In the lower half of gg1b, for instance, the dialogue between Peter and the musicians exhibits various alterations of this sort (IV.v, 2695-2708). Sometimes these changes can be seen as Compositor E's attempts to divide one line at the caesura to fit the verse to his measure, or as another mechanical expedient. But often, as with the alterations in IV.v, the nature of the changes suggests the operation of some literary judgment while annotation of stage-directions, speech-prefixes, or dialogue in the area indicates the presence of an editorial hand. These alterations in Rom. are comparable to those in other Folio plays set from known quartos—though not nearly so numerous as those in 1H4 , for example—and constitute a specific problem needing further investigation as to their origin and purpose. 31 Of more general interest are the questions which the editorial annotations of Romeo and Juliet raise about the exact origin of the Folio's readings. Of course such shadowy and elusive matters cannot be explored in a vacuum nor decided in any final way without reference to other plays in F1, for the editing of this particular play was actually part of a larger process which remains somewhat obscure at best. Yet because this play has editorial changes that can be rather precisely differentiated from compositorial error and also exhibits probably the least complicated sorts of annotation found anywhere in the Folio, Rom. offers an unusually good opportunity for inquiring into the origins of the Folio's readings, however brief that inquiry and however provisional its conclusions must be. The most obvious question is whether or not a playhouse manuscript, specifically the prompt-book, was the source of these annotations. The evidence is far from conclusive either way. Despite the verdict rendered by Greg and others who have followed him, it can be argued that the non-compositorial alterations in Rom. are not unlike those in other plays which have often been viewed as signs of the prompt-book. The attention to and correction of speech-prefixes are remarkable, particularly those changes which eliminate ambiguities that Greg (p. 114) believes would be "intolerable" in a prompt-book (e.g., ' Wi. ' to ' La. ' at 2221, or ' Appo. ', ' Poti. ', ' Po. ' to ' App. ' at 2786ff.). The substantial alterations of the stage-directions are also noteworthy: many of these are business-like, and some are of the imperative kind often cited as theatrical. 32 The added ' Fight ' (70) is an example, but of especial interest are the shortened stage-directions ' Knocke ' in III.iii (1881, 1885); identical parallels to them occur in The Second Maiden's Tragedy , the earliest extant prompt-book of the King's Men, where the "prompter" has added the simple ' Knock ' four times in one scene. 33 The provision of two re-entries, for Tybalt and Lady Capulet (1556, 2592), could certainly be traced to a bookkeeper concerned with such details (see Greg, p. 133). One could also assert that the removal of ' Will Kempe ' (2680) is evidence of a revival of the play (see Greg, p. 114), and that the censorship found in F1 is likewise a sign of a post-1606 revival, though it is slight and generally not as thorough as in other plays (cf. 1H4 , where there are many oaths and consequently many cuts). Finally, there is the rather substantial evidence of the correspondence between the Folio's readings and Q1's, which are often very similar and sometimes curiously so. These agreements range from being substantially to precisely the same, and the simplest way of explaining them would be to postulate a single source—the prompt-book itself. With this argument there are naturally many difficulties, for the situation is not a simple one and is indeed ambivalent. One difficulty relates directly to Q1. As mentioned, F1 not only fails to incorporate alterations present in Q1, but often varies from it in the alterations that it makes. Some of this variation, presumably from the prompt-book, could as easily be traced to the reporters of Q1 as to the editor of F1, but in other cases—e.g., ' Serving. ' &gt; ' a Servingman ', '1. Capu. &gt; '3. Cap. ', ' Capels ' &gt; ' Capulets ' (446, 612, 1433)—Q1 supplies what appear to be the authentic readings (i.e., ' Clowne ', ' Cap: ', ' Capels are') and F1's look like editorial guesses. 34 Moreover, it is of some interest that where Q1 is totally defective F1 continues to exhibit alterations that are of the same general character as those it introduces where Q1 appears to represent a theatrical tradition. Some of these Folio changes could be attributed to its sources's superiority over Q1's defects, but the failures of F1 just mentioned suggest that all its alterations might well have been made without reference to Q1's ultimate source—i.e., might not come from the prompt-book. More general observations also make the theory of F1's dependence on the prompt-book tenuous. The Folio text of Romeo and Juliet simply lacks any certain sign of its derivation from prompt-copy; it has nothing comparable to ' They sleepe all the Act ' or ' Tawyer with a Trumpet before them ' found in Folio MND , nor to the music and sounds added to Folio MV , nor even to the new "fly scene" and speeches found in Folio Tit. (also set by E). Beyond this rather negative evidence, there are the errors of commission cited by Greg, some of which suggest not simply tangles that had not been completely resolved but outright ignorance of any source other than Q3. Furthermore, the many changes in the dialogue are not what we have come to regard as sure signs of the prompt-book, whereas Folio Rom. does, for instance, lack attention to props, 35 which the prompt-book presumably would have dealt with. The attempted correction of Romeo's fly speech (1843-45+2) suggests absence of a prompt-book, where the matter should have been resolved if it was given any attention at all (at least, so we have been led to believe). The same may be said of the Folio's failure to deal with the second thoughts and unclear speeches at the end of II.ii and the beginning of II.iii. It might be possible to explain some of these inconsistencies in Folio Romeo and Juliet by postulating a playhouse manuscript that partook of some characteristics supposedly typical of the prompt-book and of some associated with foul-papers. For instance, a transcript used in mounting the play and containing random notes reflecting decisions made by the actors—including the author, presumably—would help explain some of the annotation of dialogue, the supplying and correction of speech-prefixes, perhaps the excision of ' Will Kempe ' (assuming revival after 1602), the slight attention to oaths, 36 and particularly some of the stage-directions (like ' Kils herselfe ') added by F1 but, because descriptive, supposedly not typical of the prompt-book or book-keeper. 37 Yet even such a written source will not account for some of the more remarkable Folio alterations to Q3, as Greg's verdict against "a playhouse manuscript" suggests (despite his belief that "the printing-house" must have been responsible for the Folio's changes). 38 The errors of commission which he cites—the assignment of a speech to Peter rather than Paris's Page, the substitution of the erroneous ' Enter Servant ' for the equally wrong ' Enter Romeo', the deficient exit in II.iv (2924, 568, 1309) —cannot be blamed on any sort of theatrical manuscript (nor even on messy foul-papers, which in this case of course had vanished with the printing of Q2). Moreover, even if the error of omission that Greg mentions (the neglect to alter the erroneous entry in III.v, 2069) is suspect as evidence, F1's failure to amend the glaring inconsistency in the 'grayey'd morne' passages at the end of II.ii and the beginning of II.iii (992ff.) certainly shows the Folio editor was not consulting a manuscript at this point. The fact is that many of the Folio's alterations in stage-directions, speech-prefixes, and dialogue are attributable to an intelligent editor attentively working through Q3 without the benefit of a manuscript. This has been suggested already in the discussion of Compositor E's role and the fact that his manner of setting the play (as well as his own incapacities perhaps) would have prevented him from making changes that require an understanding of the dramatic context. But a number of the changes could have been made by an editor with an eye to clarifying the action and the speeches and with no aid but his own wits. For instance, several of the new entries—e.g., ' Servant ', ' Enter Mother ', ' Enter Appothecarie ' (568, 2592, 2785)—appear to be motivated by a simple attempt to account for the presence of an immediately subsequent speaker, whether rightly (2592) or wrongly (568). A similar motivation probably lies behind some of the speech-prefixes added or corrected—e.g., ' Jul. ', ' Pet. ', ' Ro. ' &gt; ' Juilet. ' (1645, 2924, 2087). The merely formal provisions of exits added to the ends of scenes can be put down to a scrupulous editor, as can many of the alterations of dialogue, which show either an inclination to regularize meter or a disposition to clarify speeches that is misguided in its smoothing-out of puns or else is simply mistaken (e.g., 9, 492, 1520-24, 1782, 2153). Then there are the curious alterations introduced for the first time in Compositor B's part-page Gg1, the last page of the play in the Folio as finally published. This part-page, set by B together with Timon of Athens some thirteen working days (and twenty-three formes) after E had finished typesetting the rest of Rom. , exhibits two interesting variations in speech-prefixes where E's cancelled *gg3 follows Q3, and it thus affords a rather close view of the editorial process. Both speech-prefixes concern minor characters, Balthazer and Paris's Page, who are designated as ' Balth. ' (' Balt. ') and ' Boy. ' in Q3 and E's *gg3 but as ' Boy. ' and ' Page. ', respectively, in B's Gg1 (3146, 3155). In an ultimate sense of course B's ' Page. ' is correct, but elsewhere in this last scene F1 (set by E), generally following Q3, inconsistently identifies him as ' Pet. ', ' Page. ', and ' Boy. ' (Q3: ' Watch boy. ')—which makes the ' Boy. ' of E and Q3 quite satisfactory at this point (and in the theater). 39 Perhaps even less called for is the alteration ' Balth. ' &gt; ' Boy. ' at 3146: F1 (retaining the forms of Q3) elsewhere in Act V has either the speech-prefix ' Man. ' or ' Pet. ', and Balthazer is named only once in the dialogue (2735). These changes accomplish relatively little, if regularization in accord with the prompt-book is the presumed aim. But they do resemble editorial alterations elsewhere in the text. Moreover, both are curious and precisionistic alterations, and both suggest some general acquaintance with the play. It is now virtually impossible to attribute them to B (who was, incidentally, principally concerned at this time with the rather daunting task of setting Tim. from manuscript), because he seems to have followed his copy's speech-prefixes rather carefully when encountering material anew 40 and had not dealt with Rom. since composing its first page some seventy formes earlier. The alternatives are to assume that E overlooked both these annotations—which seems unlikely since other evidence suggests he was overly sensitive, rather than oblivious, to such notations—or that B's copy, whether Q3 or F1's *gg3, was subjected to further 41 annotation before he began typesetting. To make such niggling alterations, whatever their negligible virtues, it seems certain that the editor would not have gone to the trouble of re-consulting a playhouse manuscript. He must have introduced them while quickly looking over printer's copy once again before B began to set the last part-page of the play. The cancellation of the last page of Folio Rom. has resulted in two new editorial alterations that seem on the whole consistent with the other changes found in the Folio text. But the circumstances themselves are unusual. If such an editor interceded elsewhere in the play, distinguishing his independent alterations from those which he drew from a playhouse source would often prove to be an almost impossible task (a fact that has some interesting implications for Folio texts other than Rom. ). This would be true particularly if, as seems likely, the editor was either Heminge or Condell or another playhouse agent. Several features of the text can be taken as evidence of his connection with the playhouse. The Folio changes often exhibit a general familiarity with the play and an understanding of both the on-stage and off-stage action that is rather remarkable. This is true even where the first quarto is unsatisfactory, and where it is essentially sound, F1's frequent identity with or uncanny resemblance to Q1 suggests an editor well schooled in the play as performed. Moreover, ascribing the Folio's changes ultimately to the King's Men would help explain not only their general resemblance to Q1's version but their frequently theatrical nature. Some of the stage-directions are very business-like, and other changes—e.g., the additions of ' Within ' (952, 954) that Greg, in one of his rare moments, misremembers and thus suppresses—are theatrically technical. Folio Rom. exhibits not one but two added re-entries, which, Greg remarks, are "exceptional in early texts," 42 and it is of some interest that Edward Knight adds one to Massinger's carefully prepared fair-copy of Believe as you List . Whether Knight or Heminge and Condell themselves would actually have annotated the Folio copy can hardly be determined. But even if one of the players was actually the editor, his general familiarity with the work, as distinguished from dim recollection of parts (which would come into play only in certain speeches, if at all) would probably have been exhibited chiefly in the stage-directions and speech-prefixes—i.e., those features traditionally relied upon as evidence of a playhouse manuscript. Consequently, we can never be sure whether or not a playhouse manuscript was ever consulted. But it is relatively certain that an editor, rather than a compositor, is responsible for many of the changes introduced in the Folio text of Romeo and Juliet and that he made some of them at least without reference to a playhouse source (not to mention Q4 or Q1). This simple hypothesis will account for virtually all the non-compositorial alterations of Q3 found in F1, even if the question of the use of a theatrical source is in fact irresolvable. The general conclusion seems inevitable that in this Folio play we have an editor who worked through Q3's text with (for his day) considerable care, annotating the printer's copy where it struck him as deficient and relying mainly on the context to do so, though perhaps occasionally—and certainly not often enough—consulting a playhouse manuscript.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History (1955), pp. 231-232, 235. Two editors who have written extensively on the play concur. Richard Hosley, Yale edition (1954), p. 162, "The Corrupting Influence of the Bad Quarto on the Received Text of Romeo and Juliet ," SQ , 4 (1953), 16; George Walton Williams, ed. (1964), pp. xi-xii. See also J. K. Walton The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare (1971), pp. 232-233. The New Cambridge editors (1955) call F1 "a mere reprint of Q2"; the statement is made in passing and appears to be a lapse, and what apparently is meant is that the Folio text derives (through Q3) from that of Q2 without any new authority. No substantiation of Q2 as Folio copy appears in articles by the editors on the text of Rom. : i.e., George Ian Duthie, "The Text of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ," SB , 4 (1951), 3-29; J. Dover Wilson, "The New Way with Shakespeare's Texts: II. Recent Work on the Text of Romeo and Juliet ," ShS , 8 (1955), 81-89. Line references throughout are based on the through-line-numbering of Charlton Hinman's The First Folio of Shakespeare: The Norton Facsimile (1968), whereas the act and scene numbers are those of the Globe edition. 2 This last is clearly owing to justification, but as Greg points out it also involves the more complex alterations at 2680. 3 Greg's premises have most recently been attacked by William B. Long in an unpublished paper "Stage-Directions: A Misinterpreted Factor in Determining Textual Provenance" (delivered at the Shakespeare Association of America, April 1979). Greg, of course, was not unaware of the imperfections of the hypothesis, as his careful discussion and qualified statements in chapters 3 and 4 of The Shakespeare First Folio show, though in his examinations of particular plays he tends to be much more doctrinaire—as perhaps he has to be since he is trying to arrive at conclusions for editorial purposes: see Peter Davison's comments on this dilemma, "Science, Method, and the Textual Critic," SB , 25 (1972), 1-28. 4 George Walton Williams, "The Printer and the Date of Romeo and Juliet Q4," SB , 18 (1965), 253-254; Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), I, 200-226 and passim. Hinman's assignments receive corroboration from the additional identification criteria developed by T. H. Howard-Hill, "New Light on Compositor E of the Shakespeare First Folio," The Library , 6th ser., 2 (1980), 156-178. 5 Brian Gibbons in his new Arden edition (1979), p. 2. 6 That the matter would be thought through this carefully is doubtful, but these seem to be the rational explanations for the Folio's change, which was probably motivated perceptually. Of course, 'off' could not have been a variant spelling of the Q3 compositor, since he would have set a ligature instead of the awkward double letters, but Q3's page gives this appearance . It is possible that Q3's reading is a result of transposition (of letter and space), but the medial position of the second f in this first line of Q3's sig. I4 suggests otherwise. An almost identical example of typographically caused amendment occurs earlier, in Romeo's climactic soliloquy, where Q2's 'got this' appears in Q3 as 'gott his' and F1 "corrects" to 'got his' (1544); in this instance, though, Q4 agrees with F1 and the variation only serves as another example of the Folio practice displayed at 2416. I have used microfilm of the Huntington Q3 and Q4 but have checked the readings of Q3 against an original in the British Library. 7 The type in this line appears to have been loose during printing, particularly on the evidence of the BL copy. 8 For a fuller discussion of the evidence, see "McKerrow, Greg, and Quarto Copy for Folio Romeo and Juliet ," forthcoming in The Library . 9 For the record these occur at tln, 487, 763, 765, 1325-30, 1338, 1416, 1420, 1427, 1433, 1544, 1686, 1927, 2102, 2695-97, 3060, 3174. 10 Ronald B. McKerrow, Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare: A Study in Editorial Method (1939), p. 106; see also Fredson Bowers, Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964), pp. 158-171. 11 Quotations and citations of Q1 are from the diplomatic reprint in Horace Howard Furness's Variorum, 15th ed. (n.d.); this has been checked against an original in the British Library. 12 Hosley, "The Corrupting Influence of the Bad Quarto," p. 21, n. 29; see also Williams, ed. (1964), pp. xi-xii, Gibbons, p. 2. The three speech assignments already mentioned —those in II.ii, II.iii, III.v (992-998, 999-1009, 2215-19)—are the only significant instances of agreement between Q1 and Q4 that Professor Hosley cites, so far as I can tell; since there are only three (or perhaps two, as 992-998 and 999-1009 are contiguous and so related as to constitute practically one passage) and since they involve rather tangled and corrupt text, the evidence is less substantial for so broad a conclusion than might be desired. There is indeed other similar evidence, as well as conflicting evidence which poses problems for the theory analogous to those glanced at here. 13 As it should not be, since it is based largely on Alice Walker's extrapolation from the atypical evidence of 1H4 : see Paul Werstine, "Compositor B of the Shakespeare First Folio," AEB , 2 (1978), 241-264. 14 The argument is of course somewhat circular, as must be any investigation of such evidence as survives, especially that of the text itself (less so of the proofreading or the mechanical botches exhibited decreasingly throughout E's earlier work). That is, any assessment of E's non-typographical errors must first exclude those changes attributed to annotation, but the attempt to identify the latter depends in part on some notions about the compositor. Still, some examination of the more clear-cut evidence of annotation in Rom. is possible; I hope to offer a preliminary assessment of E in the near future. 15 He may well have had a different function later on, as T. H. Howard-Hill argues in "A Reassessment of Compositors B and E in the First Folio Tragedies" (Columbia, S.C.: privately printed, 1977); this has lately been summarized in his "New Light on Compositor E of the Shakespeare First Folio." On Compositor A, see Gary Taylor's recent "The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio," SB , 34 (1981), 96-117. 16 This generalization may not hold for sig. ee2 v of Tit. ; Howard-Hill ("Reassessment," p. 8; "New Light," p. 174) argues that the evidence "strongly indicates" that this page was set by B, but analysis suggests that the attribution must remain tentative at present. 17 Hinman, I, 45. On the identification of the other men, see Taylor. That the process was quite as cut-and-dried as this seems doubtful, since E may well have been called on to set various portions of his next page at various times as a case became available—a hypothesis which would, by the way, explain certain curious evidence of his variable performance—but this kind of on-again, off-again procedure does not materially affect the basic argument made here. 18 Hinman, I, 360-362; Hinman (II, 249) expresses some reservations about E having typeset part of sig. ggl, but the comma spacing used by Howard-Hill to identify E elsewhere in F1 is alone enough to confirm Hinman's attribution of this page to E. 19 The inherent improbability of all this is of course highlighted not only by the fact that the Q4 editor—who noted the problems at 992-998, 999-1009, 2215-19—let this pass, but also by the fact that later readers, working at more leisure, have had difficulty comprehending the action in this scene. 20 George Walton Williams, "A New Line of Dialogue in Rom. ," SQ , 11 (1960), 84-87. See Q1, 1109, 1143, which has ' Enter Tibalt ', as well as ' and flyes ' in an extended stage-direction. 21 As Greg must have assumed, since unfortunately his book could not benefit from Hinman's contemporaneous "Cast-Off Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare," SQ , 6 (1955), 259-274, nor from his subsequent identification of Compositor E in 1957. 22 The other indefinite aspect of this stage-direction—'three or four Citizens'—is not altered at all; Greg mentions this as an example of foul-papers (p. 136). On B's practice of altering text to fit his measure, see Reid, "Justification and Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B," SB , 27 (1974), 91-111. 23 The relatively curt instructions are as follows: 938: ' Cals within ' (Q3 omits); 1881: ' Knocke ' (Q3: ' They knocke '); 1885: ' Knocke ' (Q3: ' Slud knocke '); 3035: ' Kils herselfe ' (Q3 omits); 952, 954: ' Within ' (Q3 omits). Greg misremembered the last two as the speech-prefixes 'Nurse'. 24 F1 does in fact alter Q3's roman in this letter to italic in accordance with its general style, but this must be put down to an editor also, or perhaps to the general rules of the house for the Folio, since it is found in stage-directions and elsewhere in Rom. and in the Folio as a whole. Comparable attention to such detail in dialogue occurs at 1H4 , 226. 25 He has a tendency to regularize to ' Rom. ' (especially from ' Ro '), but towards the end of the play particularly he follows Q3. Rarely does he expand a Q3 speech-prefix to give the full name of a character unless there is a special circumstance, such as the length of the typographical line: 171, 1151, 1220, 1876. For the same reason he follows Q3's full forms at 1205, 1290, 3032, 3038, 3050. He does the same with 'John' at 2833 and 2842, but he expands Q3's ' Joh. ' to this full form at 2819 and 2824. These two regularizations are the only full forms E introduces towards the latter half of the play, but they may represent editorial annotation, as in the changes cited below. 26 This is true even though F1's solution seems unsatisfactory to modern editors; it represents an intelligent recognition of the problem and since its error suggests want of an authoritative manuscript, it reflects all the more highly on the Folio editor. 27 See Hinman, I, 282-330 and especially his 'The Proof-Reading of the First Folio Text of Romeo and Juliet ," SB , 6 (1954), 61-70, supplemented by James G. McManaway, "Another Discovery of a Proof Sheet in Shakespeare's First Folio," HLQ , 41 (1977), 19-26. I believe something similar will account for lines 1062 and 1127, where E seems to have moved 'rest' directly across the column and replaced a word now lost. Whether this resulted from annotation and thus implies a previous but hidden round of proof-correction is a moot point. 28 For example the similar 'Tortyrs' &gt; 'Tortoyrs', for the proofreader's 'Tortoys' at Rom. 2769, or those at Tit. 1171, 2554+1, Rom. 2686+1, though this last depends on the assumption of annotation of relined verse (see below). Interchanges of letters or spacing that were corrected rightly in Rom. may be seen at 343 and 2332 (of letters) and at 130, 197, 614, 2803, 2884 (of simple transpositions). The 'itli ght' at 2067 remained uncorrected. 29 Probably these annotations were aimed at not only inserting a query but also deleting the anomalous (for F1) apostrophe, but about the latter it is difficult to be sure. 30 Also perhaps for the omission of 'by' instead of 'Jesu', if we can again postulate E's misinterpretation of annotation; but cf. 1H4 , 816, set by Compositor B. 31 See Fredson Bowers, "Establishing Shakespeare's Text: Notes on Short Lines and the Problem of Verse Division," SB , 33 (1980), 74-130, for comments on this general problem throughout F1, esp. pp. 110-122. The changes in Folio Rom. are too complex to be dealt with here and in any case ought to be discussed in conjunction with the similar ones in other Folio plays. For the record, see tln 31-32, 64-65, 1224-1225, 1226-1227, 1325-1327, 1369-1370, 1721-1722, 1727-1728, 1878-1879, 2717-2718, 3033-3034, to mention only those without a possible mechanical cause. 32 Greg himself eschews this simple formula in his general discussion (p. 121), though using it in discussing one or two plays (e.g., 1H6, AYL ); his more qualified appraisal of the latter play in The Shakespeare First Folio (1955) offers an instructive contrast to the more confident assessment in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1942), p. 144. Others, however, have been less cautious: see the New Cambridge edition of AYL by J. Dover Wilson (1926) and the New Arden by Agnes Latham (1975). In the matter of speech-prefixes Greg is, as often, following McKerrow, specifically "A Suggestion Regarding Shakespeare's Manuscripts," RES , 11 (1935), 459-465. 33 Ed. Greg (Oxford: Malone Society, 1909), ll. 1325-1358. Here also occurs ' Knock w thin ' in the bookkeeper's hand, which is somewhat like Folio Rom. 952, 954; nevertheless, the main scribe writes ' With in ' as a speech-prefix ( SMT , 1336, 1381). One might also cite the F1 editor's ' Cals within ' (938) as an "imperative," though the first word can be taken as a verb and thus as a part of a "descriptive" direction. However, conflicting evidence appears where the main scribe of SMT , not the bookkeeper, writes ' Kills her self ' (1356), which parallels the same descriptive stage-direction added by the Folio editor ( Rom. 3035). Such observations are of course subject to Greg's caveat that "there is hardly a stage-direction that has been cited as characteristic of the prompter that cannot be paralleled from texts for which the author was probably alone responsible" (p. 123), though practically all evidence for prompt-book disappears under this disclaimer. 34 The extent to which these may in fact represent E's botchings of annotations is a question, but it cannot be pressed too hard or too often. 35 E.g., the dagger in V.iii and the complicated business of the bed that probably was needed from IV.iii onward. 36 See Chambers, I, 237-242, whose point about the 1606 Act's pertinence to stage speeches rather than published prints is well taken. However, it does not necessarily follow that printers did not also expurgate, just to protect themselves. 37 Scribal transcripts intermediate between foul-papers and prompt-book have been posited of late for TN, AYL , and JC by Robert K. Turner, Jr., "The Text of Twelfth Night ," SQ , 26 (1975), 128-138, Fredson Bowers, "The Copy for Shakespeare's Julius Caesar ," SAB , 43 (November 1978), 23-36, and Richard Knowles, ed., As You Like It , New Variorum Edition (New York: MLA, 1977), 332-334, though both Turner and Knowles also suggest transcripts made specifically for F1. See also Fredson Bowers' general discussion of the matter in On Editing Shakespeare (1955; repr. 1966), 10-32. It is of course another thing to argue—as Alice Walker did in "Quarto 'Copy' and the 1623 Folio: 2 Henry IV ," RES , 2 (1951), 217-225, repeated in Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953)—that such a manuscript would have been used to annotate a quarto, but this seems the only possibility if we assume there would have been a relatively close comparison of Q3 with a manuscript, as Greg appears to suggest in his comments on Rom. The other alternative is the use of the prompt-book occasionally in conjunction with the editor's own independent alterations, as discussed below. I wish to thank the Editor for much good counsel, especially in formulating several points in these last paragraphs. 38 Since analysis rules out the compositors, the only way to redeem Greg's belief is to argue for an editor in the playhouse, presumably Jaggard himself. This is a general notion that Greg briefly entertains (pp. 78-80), favoring Jaggard rather than Pollard's candidate Blount, though in the end he finds the case inconclusive. There is some particular evidence for this view in a few alterations in the Pavier quartos that anticipate later ones found in F1 and in Folio Rom. itself, where the two new alterations in Compositors B's Ggl (discussed below), certain altered stage-directions and speech-prefixes, and the general literary and literal concern with the readability of the text (manifested in the treatment of puns and attention to other minutiae of the dialogue) might suggest such an editor. All this evidence, however, is equally subject to other interpretations, and in general the notion of a printing-house editor faces the same objection as that raised above in the discussion of Jaggard's supposed use of Q4—the general question it raises about his motivation in undertaking so time-consuming, laborious, and costly a task, when in other plays he seems to have relied on Shakespeare's company for preparation of copy. 39 See 2924, 2861, 3036. At 2924, of course, Q3 omits the speech-prefix and F1 (E) adds the wrong ' Pet. ', whereas Q1 has ' Boy :' and Q4 ' Page. ' at this point. 40 Fredson Bowers, "Foul Papers, Compositor B, and the Speech-Prefixes of All's Well that Ends Well ," SB , 32 (1979), 79-81; Hinman, II, 280-285. 41 Further, because ' Exeunt omnes ' in *gg3 as well as B's Gg1 and 'raie' / 'raise', ' Romeos ' / ' Romeo ', 'Ladies' / 'Lady' are probably editorial (3174, 3178, 3185). 42 Greg, p. 133; what he means by "texts" (whether only manuscripts or prints as well) I am not sure, but specified re-entries are not extraordinary in Shakespeare.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Copyright Documents in the George Robinson Archive: William Godwin and Others 1713-1820 by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Manchester Public Library is an archive of several hundred documents dated 1713 to 1820 relating to payment for literary property by George Robinson and a few other booksellers which seems to be scarcely known to scholars of literary and publishing history. Since copyright documents are somewhat uncommon outside the few publishing firms surviving from the 18th Century such as Longman and John Murray; since George Robinson was a major publisher, called by one contemporary The King of Booksellers; and since some of the documents concern works of importance such as William Godwin's Political Justice , it is worth while summarizing the archive in the great table below, after first setting it in context. George Robinson (1737 - 6 June 1801) was an enterprising and generous book-seller of whose "integrity too much cannot be said"; 1 these characteristics are repeatedly observable in the documents cited below. He set up shop at No. 25, Addison's Head, Paternoster Row, in 1764, and the firm continued there until 1822, long after his death. 2 According to the London directories of the time, his firm traded as Robinson &amp; Roberts (1764-76), as George Robinson (1772-85), as George, George [Jr], John, &amp; James Robinson (1785-93), as George, George [Jr], &amp; John Robinson (1794-1801), as George [Jr] &amp; John Robinson (1802-6), as George Robinson [Jr] (1806-1813), as George Robinson [III] &amp; Samuel Robinson (1814-17), and as Samuel Robinson (1818-30), and most of these styles and dates are confirmed in the Manchester documents. George Robinson's first partner John Roberts died about 1776; George Robinson's brother James retired about 1793; his son George died on 22 May 1811; and his brother John (1752-2 Dec 1813) was, with George Robinson [Jr], declared bankrupt on 8 Dec 1804 partly because of a fire in the printing-office in which they had invested—and after 1804 John Robinson became a partner of George Wilkie at No. 57, Paternoster Row (1806-14). The firm was of a liberal political persuasion; George Robinson founded The New Annual Register to support the Whigs in opposition to the Tory Annual Register , George Robinson supported William Godwin while he was writing his great Political Justice , and the four Robinsons were fined in 1793 for publishing Paine's Rights of Man . Something of Robinson's character is given by William West: "George Robinson, Sen., might be considered the Prince, nay, the King of Booksellers. . . . The elder Robinson, was perhaps, the most enterprising, intelligent and communicative bookseller with authors of his day, and among those who partook of his hospitality, were the celebrated Arthur Murphy, . . . John Louis Delolme, . . . Dr. Glover, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Wallis, Mr. Holcroft, Alexander Chalmers and others; and in his more select parties . . . Mrs. Inchbald, Mrs. Radcliffe, &amp;c., &amp;c., visited at his town house in Pater Noster Row, where the wits and critics of the day assembled; he possessed a vast share of ready wit and repartee himself, and [ his publications ] . . . brought him in contact with the first men of the age. He was a most social companion and . . . was said to be a six bottle man, sometimes knocking up . . . some of his Irish and Scotch friends, and Correspondents, among whom were . . . the Elliott's and Kayes, &amp;c. of Edinburgh. . . . Nothing could be more gratifying than meeting Robinson and his son and brothers with their parties at their villa at Streatham, about six miles from London. Here I have often seen Holcroft, Godwin, Chalmers and others. . . . John Louis Delolme was a visitor here, when his eccentricities would admit; he was naturally of a gloomy disposition, and disappointments from higher quarters in his expectations from the Constitution and other able political writings encreased his irritability". 3 All these books and authors figure in the copyright documents in Manchester. The documents in the Robinson Archive include those of a number of booksellers besides the Robinsons, however. George Robinson was a large-scale dealer in copyrights which he bought from other booksellers and sold in his turn, and the copyright dates here range from 1713, for a work published by Bernard Lintot, the publisher of Pope, to 1820, for a work published by Joseph Johnson's successor Rowland Hunter. The Archive is probably a characteristic cross-section of copyright documents for over a century, especially for 1770-1803. As would be true for any successful bookselling firm, the Robinson copyrights concern mostly bread-and-butter works of proven vendibility, compendia of household or professional usefulness which are of comparatively little interest to posterity. These include such best-sellers as John Abercrombie's Every Man His Own Gardener , which went through dozens of editions from 1767 to 1867, Every Man His Own Lawyer , Every Man His Own Broker , editions of the Bible, cookery books, The Pocket Conveyancer , numerous books on law, school texts on arithmetic and spelling and the classics, a sixtieth share in Shakespeare's plays, dictionaries of English, French, Italian, medicine, law, and chemistry, The Physician's Vade-Mecum , and The Seaman's New Vademecum . Besides these publishing staples, there are a good many works of greater interest. There are novels by Henry Brooke and William Godwin and William Thomson, plays by Thomas Holcroft and Elizabeth Inchbald and Beaumarchais, Charles Burney's History of Music . Voltaire's Works, translations by Smollett and Inchbald and Holcroft, periodicals such as The Journal of Natural Philosophy , The Ladies' Magazine , The Town and Country Magazine , The London Magazine , The Critical Review , 4 The New Annual Register , The Telegraph newspaper, and The Courier newspaper. Perhaps the most interesting documents are those relating to William Godwin. The archive is, however, only a small fragment of what once existed for the Robinson firm. These documents refer to about two hundred works published by the Robinsons from about 1764 to 1815, but A Catalogue of New Books, and New Editions of Books, Printed for G.G. and J. Robinson . . . in the Year 1792 lists about one hundred fifty works published (or in print) in that year alone, and A Catalogue of Books Printed for G. &amp; J. Robinson . . . March, 1804 , though it omits periodicals and many ephemeral works, lists about seven hundred titles for that year. I do not know what became of the rest of the Robinson archive. This fragment was acquired by a 19th Century bibliophile named Thomas Greenwood and passed from him to Manchester Central Library in 1935. It is quoted here by permission of The City of Manchester Cultural Services Committee. The documents tell us how much was paid for a work and when. It is striking how many of these papers concern improvements of works already in print—payment for indices or translations or corrections or abridgements. Most of these were of course paid for as commissions by the bookseller or, in one case, by a theatre-manager. Even more interesting are the works which are copyrighted in the name of a person not previously associated with the book. Often this is because the work was anonymous or pseudonymous, and this archive identifies many of the authors and translators who might otherwise be unknown. It also indicates occasionally who had acquired the copyright of a work before it passed to the Robinsons. The status of copyright in the 18th Century was uncertain and changing, with great disputes between the London Trade, which claimed perpetual copyright in the works they controlled, and interlopers such as John Bell in London or the Scottish booksellers, who claimed that copyright protection was for only a statutory number of years, after which the work passed into the public domain. A number of lawsuits left the issue obscure until, in 1774 in the case of Donaldson vs Becket, the legal concept of perpetual copyright in literary works was apparently abolished. 5 Booksellers often banded together in congeries towards the end of the 18th Century, partly to finance expensive publications such as Johnson's Poets or encyclopaedias, and partly to control the publication of lucrative works such as Shakespeare's Plays, of which George Kearsly acquired a sixtieth share in 1768. 6 Whatever the law said, the cautious bookseller saw to it that his copyright agreements were as comprehensive as possible, and a number of these documents convey the copyright in a work "forever" even after 1774. In the Manchester Archive, the manuscripts are in roughly alphabetical order of vendor. In the Table below, I have made the alphabetical order uniform and supplied cross-references for translators, editors, anonymous works, and the like. There are of course hundreds of hands represented in the archive—almost all the documents are entirely in manuscript, though a few are on printed forms—and some of them are not easy to read. Doubtless a few of the works in the Table which are not identified proved elusive because I have mistranscribed the name of the author or the book. There are many difficulties in the way of identifying these works. The vendor of the copyright may not be the author of the book, as in the cases of the booksellers W. Ballard, John Bell, John Coote, Robert Faulder, Bernard Lintot, John Murray, Joseph Pote, James Robson, David Steele, Jacob Tonson, and Barnes Tovey. The author may be identified so vaguely ("Revd Mr Jones") as to make identification tedious if not impossible. The service performed by the vendor may be so minor, in translating the work, say, or abridging it (Charles Allen), or making an index (Abercrombie, Beatson, Nicholson), or reading proof (Abercrombie, Hutton, Devaulx—"two Proofs of each Sheet"), or correcting the punctuation (F. Jones), or revising the book (Abercrombie, Bell, Boote, Cunningham, Dorrington . . .), or editing it (Salmon), that it was not thought worth recording on the titlepage the name of the performer. The name of the author, while often quite clear in these records, may not be recorded in the book or elsewhere at all, and it is only in these documents that we learn who some of the authors are. The most extreme casualness is manifested by Alexander Thomson, who gave George Robinson liberty to publish The Physician's Vade-Mecum "under what Name he thinks proper". But notice that sometimes it is not clear whether the vendor is the author or a bookseller who has acquired the copyright or a relative of the author. The documents record who was paid for what, but they do not always indicate why the receiver deserved payment for that work. Sometimes the title is remarkably laconic, as in W. W. Ellis's Authentic Narrative of a Voyage Performed by Captain Cook and Captain Clerke , called merely Narrative in these documents, or the "Stretch Bible" sold by Jno Coote. When the initial words of a title are silently omitted, as in Pyle's [ Ninety-Six ] Sermons or Jesse's [ Dissertation on the Learning and ] Inspiration of the Apostles , the task of identification becomes more difficult, and sometimes titles are altered, as when Culley's Observations on Livestock is called "Treatise on Livestock". Some of the titles I have not identified may be elusive because of their brevity and vagueness, such as Thomas Coote's Original Letters or Godwin's On the Revolution in France . Some, however, are described in considerable detail, such as William Dardies' collection of Original Letters of the Much Celebrated Alexander Pope which seems to have left no trace, though Robinson paid him the handsome sum of £600 for them. Pilon and Rayner provide similar examples; they must have been published, but, if they were, they have left no trace which I can find. 7 Where are the bestsellers of yesteryear? Gone to dustheaps, far too many. Of the ephemeral or unidentified works here, perhaps the most striking are the novels. Clearly many more novels once existed than are recorded in Watt's Bibliotheca Britannica , Block's Catalogue of the English Novel 1740-1850 , the catalogue of The British Library, or The National Union Catalogue , but it is disconcerting to observe how high the proportion is. Many of the works recorded here were published anonymously, and these records permit positive identification of their authors or translators, some perhaps for the first time. 8 These include John P. BURROWS, France and England , A Novel (1787) Charles DODD, The Curse of Sentiment , A Novel (1787) Anna EDEN, The Confidential Letters of Albert , A Novel (1790) Thomas HOLCROFT, Try Again : A Farce (1790) Anna Maria JOHNSON, Retribution , A Novel (1788) Lewis LYONS, translator of d'Epinay's Conversations of Emily (1787) Leonard MACNALLY, Tristram Shandy , A Farce (1783) William OPPENHEIM, translator of Anon., Cisalpine Republic (1798) Barbara PILON, Marian , A Novel (1812) Andrew REID, translator of Macquer's Chemistry (1758) George Lethieuller SCHOEN, New Spain , An Opera (1790) Alexander THOMSON, Memoirs of a Pythagorean (1785) Anna THOMSON, The Labyrinth of Life , A Novel (1791) 9 William THOMSON, Fatal Follies , A Novel (1788) Elizabeth Sophia TOMLINS, Memoirs of a Baroness , A Novel (1792) Joseph TRAPP, Travels Before the Flood (1796) Anne URTICK, Ela , A Novel (1787) Such identifications are invaluable, particularly with such ephemeral works as novels. One must of course be cautious in assuming that the vendor of the work is the author, for sometimes the vendor is merely a relative who had inherited the work (see Cornelius Elliot and Ann Rogers) or even a bookseller. The most prolific user of pseudonyms in this list seems to be William Thomson, who apparently wrote the works attributed to Mrs Thomson, to An English Gentleman, and to Harriet Pigott. Some of the provisions of the copyright agreements are remarkably restrictive. A few agreements are for one edition only (e.g., Hooper, Jones). William Marshall not only contracted for a page-for-page reprint of his Rural Economy of Norfolk but named the printer and the member of the congery of book-sellers who was "to have the Management" of the concern, and Nicholson specified the paper to be used in his book. A few named the number of pages (e.g., Arnot) or sheets (Glover, Russell) of which the printed work was to consist, and others gave the cost of the copyright in terms of the number of sheets printed (Boote at £2.10.0, Cunningham at 10 s. 6 d. , Payne at £2.2.0, Russell at £4.40). William Nicholson agreed to provide the printer with three sheets per week, with penalties for tardiness. It was not uncommon to stipulate that the publisher should print no more than a specified number of copies, a thousand in the cases of Boote, Brooke, Brown, Forbes, Hooper, Marshall, and Moore, one thousand five hundred for Beatson, Marshall, and Payne, and two thousand for Clarke. The provision was necessary to protect authors selling one edition at a time from rapacious booksellers who might otherwise print enormous numbers of copies or even keep the type of the work standing, printing from it repeatedly, without extra payment to the author. 10 Is it an indication of George Robinson's scrupulousness or of his author's suspiciousness, that the Robinson contracts so frequently include such clauses to protect the authors? The range of prices is very large, from £5 for William Heckford's Historical Anecdotes of All the Kings and Queens of England (1787) to £2,200 for William Belsham's Memoirs of . . . the House of Brunswick , 2nd Edition (1796) and Memoirs of . . . George the Third , 2nd Edition (1795). In many cases, the author was to share the profits (e.g., Frederick, Hooper, Hutton, Marshall, Murray). Occasionally the author was partly paid in copies of the work, 11 from a gentlemanly six to Marshall, twelve to Moore, and twenty-two to Beatson, to a commercial hundred to Culley and to Payne and three hundred to Enfield. Marshall's contract called for payment to him of £15 for each shilling of the selling-price—a high but not implausibly-based rate—and some agreements called for additional payments for future editions—£15 for Enfield, £21 for Forbes, £52.10.0 for Moore, and £100 for Beatson. Kearsly was to give Glover "a douceur of Ten guineas more" if the work sold well. But few seem to call for what we might today think of as ordinary royalties, as say 10% or 15% of total sales. There seems to be no standard form of copyright agreement, and the range of stipulations is surprisingly large. The rates of payment for certain kinds of work are interesting. Translation was comparatively well-paid presumably largely on the basis of the amount translated—most translations were probably paid, as Pickar was, by the sheet. Greivey £210 Thomson £160 Cullen £157.10. 0 Marshall £ 89. 1. 0 plus Reid £ 70 Thomson £ 63 plus perhaps £5.5.0 more Brown £ 50 Holcroft £ 49.10. 0 Will £ 40 plus? Poulin £ 37.16. 0 Inchbald £ 30 Hooper £ 28.17. 6? Digby, Hooper £ 28 Farquharson £ 21 plus? Pickar £ 16. 4. 0 at 18 s. per sheet Heron £ 15.15. 0 Trapp £ 12.12. 0 plus? Street £ 8. 8. 0 plus? Lyons, Walker £ 5. 5. 0 plus? A V E R A G E £ 54. 1. 7 plus 12 Many of these writers were probably professional translators or at least booksellers' hacks, but at least two of them were successful dramatists (Holcroft and Inchbald) who were clearly being paid as much for stage sense as for translating, and one translator was the author himself (Dr Brown). The range of prices for plays was a good deal narrower than that for translations, but the average was about the same, for several of the plays were quite successful: Inchbald, Pilon £105 Inchbald, Lee, Reynolds £100 Cobb £ 63 MacNally £ 50 Inchbald, Schoen £ 42 Pilon £ 35 Inchbald, Portal £ 30 MacNally £ 10.10.0 Gibson £ 5. 5.0 plus A V E R A G E £ 58. 8.2 Of course plays have the advantage over other works from the publisher's point of view in that mostly they have had a good deal of stage-advertisement before they come to be printed, and from the author's point of view in that the author has usually been paid, even well-paid, before the work is printed. Even narrower in range and humbler in financial pretensions were the novels: White £57.15. 0 Moore £52.10. 0 plus £52.10.0 for a 2nd Edition Pearson, Thomson £52.10. 0 plus? Thomson £40 Rowson £30 Dalrymple, Davies, Dodd, Godwin, Johnson £21 Burrows £18.18. 0 plus Boldero £15.15. 0 Tomlins £11.11. 0 Pile £11 plus? Eden £10.10. 0 Urtick £ 5. 5. 0 plus £5. 5. 0 more if successful A V E R A G E £27.19. 0 The average cash payment for novels is artificially low, for a really successful author such as Henry Brooke, the inventor of The Fool of Quality (1766 ff) kept to himself seven-eighths of the profits (and expenses) of his novel Juliet Grenville (1773). On the other hand, George Robinson almost certainly paid novelists a good deal more generously than many other booksellers did. In her Minerva Press 1790-1820 (1939), 72-73, Dorothy Blakey assembles a good deal of evidence about what was paid for novels at this time. In April 1757 The Critical Review asserted that the Noble brothers "never paid to any author for his labour a sum equal to the wages of a journeyman taylor", and Lackington in his Memoirs (1791) said he had been told of booksellers "who frequently offer as low as half a guinea per volume for novels in manuscript; it is a shocking price to be sure, but it should be remembered that . . . many novels have been offered to booksellers, indeed, many have actually been published, that were not worth the expence of paper and printing, so that the copyright was dear at any price". Mr Jones in Robert Bage's Man as He Is (1792) was paid £6 for two volumes, and little Tim Cropdale in Smollett's Humphry Clinker (1771) "had made shift to live many years by writing novels, at the rate of five pounds a volume". Fanny Burney was paid £20 for her first novel Evelina , though she was given £250 for Cecilia , and one author says the Minerva Press authors were normally paid £10 to £20. Dorothy Blakey herself estimates that "the average [ price for a ] novel ranged from five to twenty pounds". Clearly, if these figures are to be trusted, Robinson was a good deal more generous with his novelists than most booksellers were, for a third of the novelists listed here were paid £21 and a third were paid more. A few of the contracts are distinctly odd in legal terms. For example, Timothy Cunningham revokes the agreement he had previously made with John Coote for his book, and one wonders whether all contracts could be as casually and unilaterally altered as this. Clearly for many of these documents, the force was moral rather than legal, and in many if not most cases there probably was no legally binding contract at all beyond these casual documents. Some form of the phrase "I promise to execute an Assignment on demand" frequently recurs, implying to me that the author would sign a legal contract if necessary. The legal costs of such an official assignment were high—£4.5.0 for William Marshall's Memorandum of 1803—and apparently in most cases the promise to make such an assignment was taken to be an adequate substitute. The relationship of author with bookseller, or at least with George Robinson, was ordinarily pretty easy-going, and it is only with very large works, such as Shakespeare's plays or the Biographia Britannica or Voltaire's Works, or with potentially popular works, such as Brooke's Julia or Godwin's Political Justice or Belsham's Memoirs of . . . the House of Brunswick and the Bible that formal, elaborate legal documents were drawn up. For some of these, the scale was very large indeed. Though the largest edition-size mentioned here is two thousand copies, there were 12,776 copies of Voltaire which changed hands (apparently seven sixteenths of those still in print) and 180,000 numbers of Rider's Bible. Clearly here is the bread and butter of the bookseller's trade. A very few of the documents have nothing to do with payment, as when Charles Du Bellamy disclaimed any share in The Cheerfull Companion . The only document which, because of its nature, will not fit conveniently in the Table below reports on the progress of the Biographia Britannica , the Second Edition of which was revised chiefly by Andrew Kippis (Vol. I-V [F] in 1778-93): At a Meeting of the Committee, of the Biographia Britannica March 26, 1794; Present D r Kippis, Mr Longman, Mr Robinson and Mr Nichols.

Rivington is not named above ] Geo: Robinson The plan was frustrated by the death of Dr Kippis at the age of seventy on 8 October 1795, eighteen months after the agreement, and only the first half of Volume VI was published, in 1795. Probably the most important group of documents in this Archive is those relating to William Godwin, who worked for George Robinson steadily in 1783-1793 as a man of letters or bookseller's hack. In his journal, Godwin wrote of the year he was twenty-seven: "This was probably the busiest period of my life; in the latter end of 1783 I wrote in ten days a novel entitled Damon and Delia, for which Hookham gave me five guineas, and a novel in three weeks called 'Italian Letters' purchased by Robinson [ 5 January 1784 ] for twenty guineas . . .". 13 Italian Letters was long lost to sight until Professor Burton Pollin discovered a copy which he published in 1965. The price in the Robinson Archives confirms the sum in Godwin's journal. In 1781 George Robinson had founded The New Annual Register , to rival the Tory Annual Register , which Edmund Burke had established in 1759. For a time the Historical Part of The New Annual Register was conducted by Dr Gilbert Stuart, but, as Godwin wrote, after Stuart "had thrown up his task", Godwin finished "the historical part of the New Annual Register" [July 1784], and thereafter he "was installed in due form writer of the historical part of the New Annual Register at the stipend of 60 guineas". 14 I take it that the stipend was £126 a year, or perhaps ten guineas a month, for from 4 March to 23 December 1785 (nine and one-half months) Godwin was paid ninety guineas for his work on The New Annual Register . (Note that in 1791 and 1794 Gregory was paid £126 for the Historical Part of the The Annual Register .) Perhaps some of this payment was for work on sections other than "the historical part". Godwin continued this work until the summer of 1791, but none of the other Manchester documents refers directly to it. Godwin must have done a good deal of hack work which cannot now be identified. One such undertaking which may now be identified fairly confidently from the Robinson Archive is The English Peerage , which the Robinsons published in 1790; Godwin received £10.10.0 on account for it on 10 January 1786, and he recorded in his MS Journal for 28 June [1789] "Finish the Peerage". 15 At the same time that he was writing for Robinson's New Annual Register , Godwin was also contributing to Robinson's Political Herald and Review , which had been founded in August 1785 by Fox and Sheridan as a Whig journal. Godwin described himself in late 1786 "as the editor of the Political Herald", 16 and he wrote that "all the letters with the signature Mucius were contributed by me". The Robinson Archive records one payment of ten guineas to Godwin for this work on 24 November 1785. Robinson carried on the work for political rather than commercial motives, and Godwin reported that "Mr. Robinson, the bookseller, has, I think, acted in the business with honour &amp; propriety. . . . the publication is a losing bargain to him, &amp; he professes not to entertain the remotest wish of gaining by it". 16 But after three volumes, Robinson let it die in 1786. Godwin was evidently impressed by Robinson's generosity in carrying it on so long. In the next year, Robinson published Godwin's History of the Internal Affairs of the United Provinces , for which he paid him forty guineas on 25 August 1787. The work work was advertised for publication on 1 September 1787 as an octavo at 4 s. in boards. 17 Though it was reviewed favourably, 17 it apparently sold slowly, and Godwin wrote generously to Robinson in the Spring of 1788: Because of "the ill success of that volume . . . I am willing to relinquish him any part or the whole if you please of the sum which I received of you on that account." 17 Such generosity must have impressed Robinson profoundly. For some years, George Robinson was Godwin's chief source of support. As Godwin wrote in the Preface to the 1832 edition of Fleetwood , "By the liberality of my bookseller, Mr George Robinson, of Paternoster Row, I was enabled then, and for nearly ten years before [ ?1784-93 ], to meet these expenses, while writing different things of obscure note, the names of which though innocent, and in some degree useful, I am rather inclined to suppress. . . . My agreement with Robinson was, that he was to supply my wants at a specified rate, while the book was in the train of composition". Robinson's most important support for Godwin, and perhaps for literature and politics, was his extraordinarily generous agreement to support Godwin while he was writing his Political Justice . In his Journal, Godwin wrote: "In the summer of 1791 I gave up my concern in the New Annual Register, the historical part of which I had written for seven years. . . . I suggested to Robinson the bookseller the idea of composing a treatise on Political Principles, and he agreed [ 10 July 1791 ] to aid me in executing it". 18 In Political Justice (1791) itself (p. vii), Godwin wrote that "It was projected in the month of May 1791" and written "with unusual ardour" from September 1791 through January 1793. Kegan Paul 19 saw and summarized the contract for Political Justice between Godwin and Robinson, saying that Robinson "paid down" £735 for the copyright for some one hundred twenty sheets and promised £315 more on the sale of three thousand copies in quarto or four thousand copies in quarto and octavo together, 18 but apparently no one else has recorded the copyright agreement itself of 5 February 1793: These articles of agreement, made in London on the fifth day of February in the year 1793, between William Godwin of Charlton Street in the parish of St Pancras Middlesex Gentleman, of the one part; &amp; George Robinson of Pater Noster Row bookseller, on the behalf of himself &amp; partners, on the other part: witness, That the said William Godwin for &amp; in consideration of the sum of seven hundred guineas to him in hand paid or to be paid, &amp; the farther sum of three hundred guineas as is hereafter more fully expressed, hath sold &amp; assigned over to the said George Robinson the whole copy right of a certain book, of which he the said William Godwin is the author, entitled An Enquiry concerning Political Justice &amp; its Influence on General Virtue &amp; Happiness &amp; now about to be published in two volumes quarto, containing one hundred &amp; twenty sheets or thereabouts: And the said George Robinson for himself &amp; partners &amp; for his &amp; their respective executors, administrators &amp; assigns, doth hereby accept &amp; purchase the said work, &amp; doth promise to pay on demand to him the said William Godwin the sum of seven hundred [pounds del ] guineas aforementioned: And moreover that he or they shall &amp; will immediately after the sale of three thousand copies of the said work in quarto; or otherwise immediately after the sale of four thousand copies of the said work in quarto &amp; octavo added together, according as either event shall first happen, pay unto the said William Godwin, his executors, administrators or assigns, the farther sum of three hundred guineas herein beforementioned: And lastly, in order that such sale, or disposal of copies of the said work may be satisfactorily ascertained, he the said George Robinson for himself &amp; partners, &amp; for his &amp; their respective executors, administrators &amp; assigns, doth hereby covenent &amp; agree that he or they shall deliver or convey at any time hereafter, to him the said William Godwin, his executors, administrators, or assigns, sufficient extracts for that purpose from his or their accounts of sales, signed by him or them, whenever they shall be requested by the said William Godwin, or his executors, administrators or assigns, so to do.

Robinson W Godwin for Self &amp; Co Presumably the £651 which Godwin had already received had been advanced to him at various times while he was writing the work, and the chief expectation he had from the work was the £84 owing from this contract plus the possibility of £315 more, which evidently was forthcoming. But Robinson paid him forty guineas more on 24 December 1794 for corrections and additions to the Second Edition and another forty guineas for it on 11 January 1796. Robinson was remarkably generous to pay so much more for a work which had already cost him dear. Indeed, its dearness was apparently what protected Political Justice from prosecution as a seditious work. Mary Godwin Shelley wrote: "I have frequently heard my father say that Political Justice escaped from prosecution from the reason that it appeared in a form too expensive for general acquisition. Pitt observed, when the question was debated in the Privy Council, that 'a three guinea book could never do much harm among those who had not three shillings to spare'." 20 Shelley wrote on 7 January 1812 with somewhat greater hyperbole than usual: "if government at one time could have destroyed any man, Godwin would have ceased to be". 21 In 1793, the year of publication of Political Justice , the Robinsons were fined £250 for selling Tom Paine's Rights of Man for shillings rather than guineas. The last record of Godwin's own work for Robinson in these Archives is the most mysterious and tantalizing. On 5 March 1796 Robinson paid Godwin twenty guineas for what is identified in an undated receipt for the same sum as "a book to be written on the Revolution in France". Professor Jack Marken tells me that Godwin's manuscript diary indicates that from 20 January to 3 April 1796 he was writing an unnamed work, perhaps this one. I have no record that Godwin ever produced such a work, and it is possible that Robinson or Godwin, like William Blake, Joseph Johnson, William Wordsworth, and others, decided that they could not publish on the subject both truly and safely and that the project was therefore abandoned. On the other hand, since the Robinsons preserved Godwin's receipt, rather than returning it to him when he paid them back the money (if he did), it seems likely that they still regarded it as payment for goods expected and, presumably, eventually received. Perhaps Godwin did write "a book . . . on the Revolution in France" which has yet to be identified, perhaps published under a different author or title. If it does survive, it would be well worth knowing, both in itself and for the influence it may have had upon his friends, disciples, and admirers, such as Coleridge, Shelley, Blake, and Wordsworth. Godwin's mature reflections on the revolution in France, made at the height of his powers and his influence, would be very interesting indeed. When Godwin remarried in 1801, his wife took up the yoke as a bookseller's hack. About 1805, Godwin wrote that "She did her best for some years to assist our establishment by translations", 22 but her work as a translator has long been invisible or obscure. The only translations traced to her pen of which I am aware are Voltaire's Thoughts, Remarks, and Observations (Robinson, 1802), for which she was paid £31.10.0, 23 and Sylvain Golbery [i.e., de Golbery], Travels in Africa , tr. William Mudford (1803). 24 The Robinson Archive, however, demonstrates that she was also responsible for the translation of J. C. von Struve, Travels in the Crimea (1802), for which she was paid £15.15.0 on 5 June 1802, and it seems likely that Godwin had a hand in this translation, as he probably had in the Voltaire. 23 Doubtless other translations by Mrs Godwin could be traced through the Robinson firm, who were remarkably faithful to Godwin, despite his querulousness and their alarms concerning the Voltaire. 23 The Robinson Archive contains other evidence of the influence of Godwin, beyond payments for his books and those of his wife. The relationship between Godwin and Robinson was so long and so important for each, that it would be surprising if there were not authors whom Godwin introduced to Robinson and books which he specially fostered. One of these protegés of Godwin was a cheerful and somewhat egregious young man named John Arnot, who walked from Edinburgh to London, met Godwin with enthusiasm, and fell in love with his housekeeper. Godwin responded generously to the young man's energy and admiration. He encouraged him in his vagrant impulses, and the young man set off in 1798 to travel from Russia through Poland and Germany to Vienna— on foot . Arnot was to make notes on his wanderings "for a book of travels to be published on his return. Godwin warmly approved of this plan, and aided Arnot to carry it into execution". Kegan Paul quotes a number of Arnot's wayward and fascinating letters to Godwin, which, as he comments, "are extremely good", and Godwin responded with money and affection. Arnot intended to write "a great book of travel, which should supercede all existing books on the subjects treated, and come as a very revelation to his countrymen", and in fact "From Hamburg his journals were despatched to [ ?Godwin in ] England, with the intention that they should be simultaneously published in English, French, and German". However, Godwin somewhat rashly showed the manuscript to Arnot's brother about 1799, who protested strongly that "the ingenuity and knowledge which he may have evinced is prostituted in the support of sentiments which are visionary, and subsersive of all social order, and yet (thank God), totally irreducible to practice". He directs Godwin "in the most particular manner not to publish these MSS."—or, if they must be published, let it be anonymously. And Kegan Paul concludes: "There is, however, no trace of such a work discernible, his family strongly opposed the publication, and it is probable that their objections prevailed". 25 The work did come close to publication, however, for on 23 July 1803 George &amp; John Robinson agreed to pay to John Arnot, of York Buildings, Middlesex, gentleman, two hundred twenty-five guineas for his Travels thro' Russia and Poland to Vienna and Dresden in the Year 1798 , and a Plan of the Route , which was "to form a quarto volume of at least 400 pages", to be put to press in the next week, finished 1 December, and published on 15 December 1803. It seems exceedingly likely that Godwin had encouraged them to take this step. As far as I can discover, the work was never published either under the author's name or with a title anything like this one, and one may surmise that some impediment was raised by Arnot's family, by the literary quality of the manuscript—or perhaps by its "visionary, and subversive" character. At any rate, we may surely see in this contract an example of Godwin's friendship for both Arnot and George [Jr] &amp; John Robinson. The Robinson Archive throws a good deal of light upon William Godwin and a host of others. We may rejoice as much at the new views of old friends, such as Godwin's Political Justice and Charles Burney's History of Music , as we do at the raising of previously scarcely suspected ghosts, such as Arnot's Travels or Pilon's Ward of Chaucery . We are very fortunate that such tantalizing riches are preserved for us in Manchester Public Library.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 According to the elder Thomas Cadell ([William West]; "Notice of the Robinsons," Aldine Magazine ([1839], 135). "Before the year 1780, he had the largest wholesale trade that was ever carried on by an individual. . . . the bookselling firm of G. G. and J. Robinson . . . [ were for ] many years the greatest trading booksellers and publishers known in this country" (C. H. Timperley, Encyclopaedia of Literary and Typographical Anecdote , 2nd Edition [1842], 808, 852). I have incorporated in the Table below a few similar Robinson documents in Yale for Holcroft, Jephson, Malone, and Mortimer. The only similar 18th Century collections known to me, besides those for surviving firms and for Cadell and Davies, are those by William Upcott in the British Library: (1) Original Assignments of Manuscripts between Authors and Publishers, principally for Dramatic Works, 1703-1810, mostly concerned with Lowndes (Add. MSS 38,728); (2) Original Assignments . . . principally for Mathematical &amp; Elementary Works, 1707-1818, largely concerned with Nourse (Add. MSS 38,729); and (3) Original Assignments of Copy-rights of Books and other Literary Agreements between various Publishers, 1712-1822 (Add. MSS 38,730), recording chiefly what shares in copies Lowndes bought and sold at Coffee House sales. For example, at The Globe on 17 Dec 1772 George Robinson &amp; Moses Staples sold to Thomas Lowndes a quarter of Maitland's London (£153) and a ninety-sixth of [Defoe's] Tour through Britain (£1.11.6) (f. 168); at Mrs Shuckburgh's sale on 28 July 1768 Robinson &amp; Roberts bought from Thomas Lowndes one seventy-second share of Gordon's Geographical Grammar for 10 s. 6 d. (f. 169); and at The Globe on 30 Dec 1777 Thomas Lowndes bought from George Robinson one forty-eighth share of Clarke's Introduction [ to Heraldry ] for £2.17.6, one sixteenth of Ogilby's Roads for £7.17.6, and one twenty-fourth of Selecta Profani for £3.10.0 (f. 169). For details of Nourse and British Library Add. MSS 38,729, see J.P. Feather, "John Nourse and his Authors", Studies in Bibliography , 34 (1981), 205-226. N.B. There was another firm of booksellers named G. &amp; G. Robinson, in Liverpool, which retired from business and sold its extensive stock at Sotheby's, 6-11 March 1857. 2 Most of the facts about booksellers here derive from Ian Maxted's invaluable London Book Trades 1775-1800 : A Preliminary Checklist of Members (1977). 3 [William West], Fifty Years' Recollections of an Old Bookseller (1837), pp. 92-93. 4 Robinson's name does not appear on the titlepage of The Critical Review , but advertisements with the issues of January and July 1790 give G. G. and J. Robinson as publishers, as well as A. Hamilton whose name does appear on the titlepage. 5 See William J. Howard, "Literature in the Law Courts, 1770-1800," pp. 79-91 of Editing Eighteenth-Century Texts : Papers given at the Editorial Conference, University of Toronto, October 1967, ed. D. I. B. Smith (1968). 6 See Terry Belanger, "Tonson, Wellington and the Shakespeare Copyrights," pp. 195-209 of Studies in the Book Trade in Honour of Graham Pollard (1975). 7 Perhaps a few of these unidentified works were published in George Robinson's journals such as The Critical Review , The New Annual Register , and The Political Herald . 8 In one or two cases, these documents permit us to identify the name on the titlepage as a pseudonym. 9 The work is "by me", Anna Thomson (according to the receipt of 18 Jan 1791), not by Harriet Piggot, who is credited with it in the National Union Catalogue . 10 In his Modern Times (1785), III, 39, Dr John Trusler says: "If you give a bookseller a work to get printed and conclude upon an edition of five hundred; they [ sic ] will order seven hundred and fifty, or perhaps more, to be printed, call all above five hundred their own, sell all their own first, and account with you for the remainder." (Quoted in D. M. Blakey, The Minerva Press 1790-1820 [1939], pp. 77-78.) 11 Dr Hugh Farmer wrote on 24 Jan 1774 about his Demoniacs that he was to have "25 copies for my Friends"; "I will not allow a higher price than five shillings to be fixed upon the Work, without an additional consideration" (John Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century , IV [1822], 826). 12 The real average-per-book was doubtless higher, for some of these fees are incomplete, and some are for only part of a volume. 13 C. Kegan Paul, William Godwin : His Friends and Contemporaries (1876), I, 20-21. Robinson published Italian Letters on 10 July 1784 (Jack W. Marken, "The Canon and Chronology of William Godwin's Early Works", Modern Language Notes , 69 [1954], 176-180). I am grateful for advice about Godwin to Professors Gary Kelly, Robin Alston, F. E. L. Priestley, Jack W. Marken, and Burton W. Pollin. 14 Jack W. Marken, "William Godwin's Writings for the New Annual Register ", Modern Language Notes , 68 (1953), 477-479. 15 Marken (1953). There is no reference to The New English Peerage in the extensive bibliography of Godwin's own writings in Burton W. Pollin, Education and Enlightenment in the Works of William Godwin (1962) or in his Godwin Criticism : A Synoptic Bibliography (1967). Notice that Harriet Lee wrote a work called The New Peerage (1787). 16 Jack W.

      <field name="fulltext">Table of Robinson Copyrights Some of the documents are Memoranda of Agreement concerning copyright, but most are receipts for literary work, sometimes specifying "for the copy" or "copyright" or "for the literary property" and occasionally adding "in full" or "for ever". All parties normally signed the Memoranda, but of course it is only the recipient who signs the receipt. The agreements &amp;c are usually with "George Robinson", "Mr Robinson", "George Robinson &amp; Comp", or Messrs Robinson", and these vague denominations are to be assumed unless initials under the sum identify another bookseller or unless a footnote gives more information. The casualness of the writers is indicated by the fact that William Heckford refers on 29 January 1787 to Messrs Robinson &amp; Co and on 30 January 1787 to Mr Robinson. In these documents, George Robinson did business in his own name at all times (1767, 1772-1801, [George Robinson, Jr:] 1804, 1812); he worked also in partnership with Roberts (1767-70, 1773), with his son George and his brother John (1786-87, 1792, 1794-97, 1800, 1802), and with his brother John (1795, 1801-1803). All these relationships may be expressed in the name Messrs [George] Robinson [&amp; Comp y ] (1771, 1786-1805, 1815).

At the bottom is a receipt of the same date for £300. Perhaps what was sold was not a book but the manuscripts of Pope's letters themselves. 30 De Lolme (1785): A separate receipt for £60 to J. Nichols 14 April 1785 for printing and paper for the book, and another is for 19 s. 4 d. to Robert Sharp 26 January 1785 for boarding sixty copies.

Nicol, 1785-1801). 34 Dickson, R. W. (1803): A receipt for "Transcribing M r . Elkington's Draining 170 pages makes 21 sheets 2 pages[,] omitted the first 13 as useless", paid by Dr Dickson. I do not know why Dickson was transcribing the work. The 3rd Edition was published by Richard Phillips in 1808. 35 Dorrington: Receipt for £2.2.0 "which with three guineas before received is in full for Revising the Pocket conveyancer . . . for the use of M r . Rayne". See also John Coote. 36 Du Bellamy: "Mem m . I hereby decline holding any share or property demand or claim of any kind in the Chearfull Companion a Collection of Songs &amp;c published by Mr Kearsly".

[ who ] conveyed to us his whole Copy rights, property &amp; right of publishing Books Do hereby Sell Assign &amp; make over To &amp; in favour of George Robinson &amp; Comp y and Thomas Ray Booksellers in London and Bell &amp; Bradfute Booksellers in Edinburgh in the proportions following viz.

The property or Copy right of the work within mentioned composed by the within designed [ sic ] D r William Cullen. . .". No sum is given. The document is written on the outside of the agreement of 6 Jan 1790 that Charles Elliot (Edinburgh bookseller) and Colin Macfarquhar (Edinburgh printer) shall pay Cullen £1,500 and two copies for his Materia Medica . 38 Ellis: Receipt for £2.2.0 "which, with Fifty two pounds ten shillings received at different times before, is in full of all demands for the copy right of my Voyage with twelve Plates, and ten others [ sic ]". 39 Enfield, Preacher's Directory : A receipt "in full for the copyright of a work compiled &amp; published by me under the title of The Preacher's Directory , an assignment whereof I do hereby promise to execute upon demand, on condition of receiving the further sum of Fifteen pounds in case of the said work being ever reprinted thereafter. . .". 40 Enfield, Sermons &amp;c: A receipt "which with fifty printed copies of the first volume &amp; three hundred printed copies of the second volume I do hereby acknowledge to be in full for the copy right of a work composed &amp; published by me under the title of Sermons for the use of Families, in two volumes And also of another work published by me under the title of Prayers for the use of Families (of which I do hereby acknowledge to have received three hundred copies . . ." for which he promises to make an assignment on demand. A second edition of Prayers for the Use of Families was published by JJ in 1777. 41 Faulder: A printed form of agreement that the Robinsons purchased from Faulder 700 copies (£1,050 paid this day), "the Copy right of which work belongs to Arthur Murphy Esquire. . . . And Whereas at the time of entering into the contract for such purchase It was agreed that the said . . .[ Robinsons should be bound ] in the penalty above expressed [£ 2,000 ] by way of Security against the Printing and Publishing of any new Edition of the said Work within the term of five years to be computed from the day of the date of the above written obligation . . .". 42 Fenn 6 Feb 1787: This receipt is accompanied by a note for £100 at two months date "on account". Sir John Fenn edited Original Letters [The Paston Letters], 5 vols. (GGJJR, 1787-1823) [4to, £1.16.0]. In a collection of Robinson's correspondence with Fenn, 1787-89, about Original Letters Vol. III—IV (British Library Add. MSS 27,454) are discussions of the terms of publication, indicating that Vol. I-II, at least, were printed in 500 copies on a profit sharing basis (f. 14). 43 Fenn, Original Letters: A receipt for £100, plus a note at three months for £100, plus another at six months "in full for the second edition [ ?volume ] of Original Letters consisting of 500 Copies". The next edition of The Paston Letters seems to have been in 1840-41. 44 Fenning: It is annotated "6.6.0 Copy [&amp;] 23.8.9 Paper &amp;c [-] N.B. same time rec d Twenty three Pd s - Eight Shillings &amp; 19 d - For Papers Print, &amp;c-£29.14.9". 45 Forbes: "M r Francis Forbes in Warwick Street near Golden Square has this day sold George Robinson . . . a Book . . . on the following terms Viz d the said Geo Robinson to pay M r Forbes Thirty Guineas for printing one Thousand Copies &amp; when he prints a Second Edition Twenty Guineas more . . .". A separate receipt of the same day is for £15.15.0 "in part of the within ment d agreement". N.B. The National Union Catalogue , CLXXVII (1971), calls Forbes only the " supposed author ". 46 Frederick: "Frederick . . . proposes to Geo Robinson to print the same, for their joint benefit in the following Manner. . . . GR is [ to ] advance Frederick Twenty five pounds, &amp; when the sale of said Work has reimbursed GR the expenses of Paper, print g &amp; advertising &amp; the 25£ so advanced, &amp; also a profit of 25£ to the said GR then all profits from the first or any future Editions to be divided equally share &amp; share alike . . .". 47 Gifford: On the same leaf is another note by Gifford of 23 Aug 1790 for the other £21. As it is among the letter S, perhaps the author's name began with S. 48 Glover: An agreement that Glover is to furnish "sufficient copy for eight or nine Sheets of a pamphlet containing an account of Denmark" at £2.2.0 per sheet "And if the said Kearsly sells fifteen hundred Copies of the above work Glover is to receive a Douceur of Ten Guineas more . . . the copy right being afterwards Kearsly's property". 49 Godwin, Crimea : "being the remainder of the sum due to M rs . Godwin for a translation . . .". The work had been published in German (1801) and French (1802). 50 Godwin, History : It was published 1 Sept 1787, and about Spring 1788 Godwin wrote to Robinson: because of "the ill success of that volume . . . I am willing to relinquish him any part or the whole if you please of the sum which I received of you on that account" (J.W. Marken, "William Godwin's History of the United Provinces ", Philological Quarterly , 45 [1966], 381). 51 Godwin, Italian Letters : A receipt "for a MS. intitled Italian Letters". The recently-discovered, apparently unique surviving copy was edited by B. R. Pollin (1965). 52 Godwin, The New English Peerage , for which Godwin was paid (?in advance) in 1786, is probably the same as "the Peerage" which Godwin said in his MS Journal he finished on 28 June [1789] (Marken [1953]), and the latter is almost certainly The English Peerage ; or, A View of the Ancient and Present State of the English Nobility . . ., 3 vols. (GGJJR, 1790). (Vol. III consists of engraved coats of arms drawn by Charles Catton [1728-98], under whose name The National Union Catalogue lists the work.) 53 Godwin, Revolution in France : The receipt is merely "on account of a work on the French Revolution", but an undated note by Godwin directs payment of £20 "to my order on account of a book to be written on the Revolution in France". 54 Godwin, Political Justice : The second receipt specifies that together the two payments are "in full for the alterations [ called corrections in the earlier receipt ] &amp; additions in the second edition of Political Justice". 55 Gregory, New Annual Register (1792): A receipt "in full". 56 Gregory, New annual Register (1796): A note says the £70 "settles our Acc t ."; at the bottom is a scrawled note: "NB— one hundred &amp; twenty Guineas due to D r . G— for 1794 GR". 57 Gregory, New Annual Register (1802): A demand note for Zach Walker Esq.; a note from G. Gregory of 8 Jan [1802] says he has drawn on his correspondent "on account of the N.A." "in favour of our French correspondent". 58 Greivey: A receipt "in part of two hundred Guineas the sum agreed upon for which I am to compleate a Translation . . .". 59 Hamilton: An agreement among Arch Hamilton, Geo Kearsly, and Geo Robinson "that they shall all be equally concerned in new Edition of Cooke upon Littleton, to be revised by and under the inspection of Francis Hargrave", each to have one third of the expense, profit, or loss. 60 Harding: A note from Edmond Malone asking George Robinson to pay Sylvester Harding, "which place to account of that work" (Yale). 61 Hargrave (1797): A receipt for £60, plus his acceptance for £70 more, which with £30 and £50 at different times paid make £210 "being the full consideration agreed to be paid to me by him for the copy right of a quarto volume now printing at his expence &amp; intended to be published with the title . . .". 62 Hargrave (1799): Receipts for £80 and £60 of the £180 agreed upon. 63 Harris: A receipt "being in full of several publications". With it is an account: Follies of a Day Printing—7 Sheets and 1/4 by Cox including 1..12..6 Authors alterations 18..11..6 Paper ----- 43 R ms &amp; ½ &amp;c.mmat; 17 s / [ illeg ] ----- 36..19..6 Advertising ----- 10..12..6 25 Copies to the Theatre [;] 20 to Holcroft[;] 9 to Stat s .

This may be related to [John Gibson], The Fruit Gardener ; Containing the Method of Raising Stocks, for Multiplying Fruit Trees (J. Nourse, 1768). 67 Hooper, Bielfeld (1769): Memorandum of Agreement: Hooper is now translating the remaining part of Baron Bielfeld's Letters not yet printed. Robinson &amp; Roberts are to share the profits, costs, or loss, to spend £8 on advertising, and the work is to be published in October. 68 Hooper, Rational Recreations : A receipt for £25 from Geo Robinson "being his one fourth share of One hundred pounds which he, together with Mess rs Lockyer Davis [( 1718-91 ), bookseller ], Baden Law [ ?Bedwall Law ( fl. 1745-98 ), bookseller ] &amp; James Robson have agreed to pay me, in consideration of my permitting them to print One thousand copies". A memorandum of 12 Oct 1773 specifies that the work is in 4 vols., 8vo, 60 plates, that no more than 1,000 copies are to be printed, and thereafter "when the said booksellers refuse to sell the said W. Hooper twelve of the said copies in one parcel, at the customary price", the copyright shall revert to Hooper. 69 Hooper, Mercier: "one thousand copies of the said translation shall be printed at y e joint expense and risk of the said G. Robinson and W. Hooper"; a receipt of 5 June 1772 for £28.17.6 is "according to the above agreement". 70 Hutton (1775): A debtor-creditor account in which neither debtor nor creditor is identified. Presumably this is an extract from Robinson's books for profit-sharing purposes. 1775 Debtor 1775 Creditor May 20 Copy Right of Books £100 May 20 By note due 1 month £40 June 720 Copies Arith[metic] at 1 s £ 36 Aug 128 Sets of Diary July 20 Bill to Cap Smith £50 Maths Diary Poetry &amp; Math Miscel delivered by Gray the Binder in 6 vols. at 2/6 per vol.

Robinson a Book on Logarithms of about 25 or 30 Sheets of Paper, to be completed about Midsummer 1777" for £105 (including correcting the proof sheets). A receipt of 28 Jan 1785 for £26.5.0 "together with 75 guineas received before is in full for a book of Logarithms as p r Agreement". A similar separate document for £105 headed "A Project for a New Book of Logarithms" is docketted "Signed June 5. 1776. &amp; fulfilled Jan y . 28, 1785". 72 Hutton, Mensuration (1788): One third was paid by Robinson, one third by Raldwin, and one third by Wilkie. A separate obscure account of Feb 1788 with it indicates that it consisted of 45 sheets and includes deleted sums for Hutton's [ Ladies '] Diary Supplement, for his [ Principles of ] Bridges [(1772 ff.)], and [ Elements of ] Conic Sections [(1787)]. 73 Hutton, Course : The receipt is "for the expence of printing the first Edit [ £341.11.9 ] . . . including the half share of Copy right" (£123.7.6) [plus interest]; the bracketted figures are supplied in the docket. A separate account indicates the indebtedness of The Estate of the late Sir Charles Nourse to Doctor Chas Hutton 1788 March — For Revising the 3d. Edit. of [ William ] Emerson's [ Elements of ] Trigonometry [ 3rd Edition (C. Nourse, 1788 )] £ 5.5.0 Sept r . Revising the 5th Ed. [ Colin ] Maclaurin's [ Treatise of ] Algebra [(1788)] £ 5.5.0 ------- £10.0.0 (Sir Charles Nourse died 19 April 1789, and the business was carried on by Francis Wingrave.) A receipt of 24 Feb 1792 from Hutton is for £2.19.3 from Mr Wingrave "being the balance of the late Sir Cha. Nourse's Accounts". A Hutton statement of 27 June 1804 "certifies that the inclosed bill for the Cuts is correct as to the No. &amp; Price as pr. Agreement, and which account Messrs Robinson will please to settle with Mr Berryman". Yet another separate account shows Robinson's indebtedness to J. Berryman, 27 June 1804, for engraving on wood 190 cuts to Hutton's Course Vol. 1 and 236 for Vol. II at 1 s 3 d each (£26.12.6). 74 Inchbald, Appearance: A receipt from Thomas Holcroft for George Robinson. 75 Jesse, Inspiration : Receipt "for Seventy five Copies". 76 Jones, Letter : Receipt of William Stevens "for the Rev. M r Jones" "for the Right of Printing one Edition" of each work. The Confessional was by Francis Blackburne. 77 Jones, Lectures : Receipt of William Stevens "for the first Edition", paid in £26.10.0 cash and 30 copies (value £5). 78 Kippis: The account includes "Interest upon a Note for 20£ due Nov. 25, 1791" (£11), a total of £79. 5.0. It is annotated: R's bill for books 79: 5: - 8:15:- ------ 70:10:- 79 Law: Receipt "for the Copies &amp; Plates (if to be found) of Jacob Behmens Works, now in their possession". William Law (1686-1761), theologian, was a disciple of Jacob Boehme, and, after Law's death, his disciples published The Works of Jacob Behmen With Figures [by D. A. Freher] illustrating his Principles, Left by the Reverend Law, M.A., 4 vols. (1764-81); Vol. III-IV (1772, 1781) were published by GR. Perhaps the William Law of this 1802 document is a descendant of the theologian's brother George, whose share in Boehme's works the Robinsons were buying. 80 Liddell: A receipt for "my Share of the profits". The 1st edition was in 1787, the 5th in 1794. 81 Mac-Nally: A promissory note to pay Caleb Jenkins for "value received". 82 Malone: Memorandum of Agreement that "Edmond Malone shall revise, correct and superintend the printing of A new edition of Shakspeare" and Robinson shall pay £200 "to such person or persons [ as ] the said Edmond Malone shall in writing appoint, for his or their aid and care in assisting him to revise the sheets of the said work as they pass through the press"; the only payment mentioned for Malone himself is thirty sets plus plates "if any plates shall be engraved for the said work", Malone being left free to publish editions of Shakespeare in any format except quarto (Yale). 83 J. Marshall, Soulavie: The receipt is docketted Miss Picard ( q.v. ) 18 sheets at 18 s. per sheet (£16.4.0), Mr [Alexander] Walker ( q.v. ) (£5.5.0), Dr [?Alexander] Thomson (£160), "this receipt" (£89.1.0), "Deduct for Bonaparte as by receipt" (£50): "6 vols of Soulavie at 35 gs" (£220.10.0). 84 Marshall, Norfolk : A Memorandum of Agreement between William Marshall (of Pickering, Yorkshire) and Messrs. George, &amp; John Robinson, George Nicol [(1741-1829), bookseller], John Debrett [(fl. 1781-1822), bookseller] to print and publish 1,000 copies "page for page with the present or first Edition of the said work, (the Copy right of which is the sole Property of the said William Marshall) . . . William Marshall still retaining the Copy right of the said work . . .". After deducting the costs, including £20 for advertising, half the profits will go to Marshall. It is also agreed that "M r George Robinson sen r : is to have the Management, and that Thomas Wright [( fl. 1758-97 )] . . . shall be the Printer of the Edition". 85 W. Marshall, Ornament : A memorandum of Agreement between William Marshall and John &amp; George Robinson, George Nicol, William Nicol, Thomas Cadell, &amp; William Davies about publishing a new edition in not more than 1,500 copies, Marshall to retain the copyright. Marshall will be paid with six copies and with £15 for every shilling of sellingprice. Marshall's Planting and Rural Ornament , 2nd Edition (G. Nicol, GGJR, and J. Debrett, 1796) [8vo, 16 s ] was a new version of Planting and Ornamental Gardening (1785). A separate receipt of 8 Aug 1803 is for £4.5.0 paid to Edward S. Foss (the witness of the 1 April 1803 document), evidently for drawing up the Memorandum of Agreement, &amp;c., and a separate account justifies Foss's bill. 86 George Moore: A Memorandum of Agreement: There are to be not more than 1,000 copies (of which Moore is to be given twelve); the Robinsons shall give Moore notice of their intention to publish a second edition, and on its publication they shall pay £52.10.0 more "which shall complete the purchase of the work". 87 Murray, History : A Memorandum of Agreement, which continues: after M r Robinson has received five and twenty per cent for his Expences of printing and publishing the said History M r Murray is to have Equal shares in the profit, which may arise from the Sale of that Book — and M r Murray promises to Send the Said Copy to M r Robinson assoon[ sic ] as it is fairly filled for the press which is to be done im[ m ]ediately . . . . At the bottom is a receipt for £30. 88 Murray, Melmoth: A receipt "in full for one half of the Literary property or Copy right of a work now printing . . . the whole property of which the said author has assigned over to me". 89 Nicholson, Journal (1798): Receipt "for the Copy of the first volume . . . published on our joint Account". A separate demand-note of Nicholson on Messrs Robinson for £10.10.0 dated 12 March 1799 is "for Engravings for the Philos Journal". 90 Nicholson, Journal (1799): Memorandum that Nicholson and George Robinson "have this day examined and approved and settled all the Accounts claims and demands whatsoever which either of them respectively have with or upon the other as follows namely First the said William Nicholson hath sold &amp; delivered all the printed Copies of the Journal of Natural Philosophy unto the said George Robinson as far as the thirty third Number inclusive except fifty complete Setts which the said George Robinson engages to deliver to the said William Nicholson or order on demand[.] Secondly the said George Robinson is allowed to reprint one thousand Copies of the Numbers of the said Journal from the eighth to the thirteenth number inclusive to complete the first Volume without making any allowance out of such reprinted Copies or otherwise respecting the same on account of the half share which the said William Nicholson possesses and is intitled to in the Copy right and engraved plates of the said first Volume. Thirdly the said William Nicholson is released and discharged from all Claims and Demands whatsoever on the part of the said George Robinson and his partners in trade for or by reason of any charges paid or owing by him on them for paper printing engraving and so forth for the said Journal or for any Books or other goods sold and delivered unto the said William Nicholson or for any other cause matter or thing whatsoever[.] Fourthly . . . [ GR will pay Nicholson ] a certain note of hand of the said William Nicholson for two hundred pounds and to return the said Note when discharged unto the said William Nicholson without requiring any payment of the Contents thereof[.] Fifthly . . . [ Nicholson acknowledges that GR hath this day paid him £150 ] in part of payment for the printed Copies aforementioned And sixthly that he hath accepted one Bill of Exchange drawn by the said William Nicholson and payable twelve months after this date for the Sum of One hundred &amp; twenty pounds eighteen shillings which last mentioned Sum together with the other Claims and Sums hereinbefore agreed to be released &amp; paid or mentioned to have been paid in and are accepted by the said William Nicholson as a full and perfect compensation for all the Copies hereinmentioned to have been sold by him unto the said George Robinson and also in discharge of all and every Sum or Sums of Money which may be due &amp; owing from the said George Robinson unto the said William Nicholson for sales of the first thirty three Numbers of the said Journal or any other Account whatsoever And lastly it is agreed that the said George Robinson shall charge no Commission for selling any of the subsequent Numbers of the said Journal for the said William Nicholson but shall account &amp; pay for the same at the usual Rate of nine pounds twelve shillings for every hundred numbers . . .". 91 Nicholson, Journal (1801): An agreement appointing GJR "sole publishers of my Journal . . . with the Allowance of a Commission of five per Cent on the Sales", the accounts to be settled every six months, Robinsons to supply the paper and pay "the small Expences of stitching &amp;c . . . but I will myself pay for printing and Engraving without their being at all responsible"; the Robinsons have accepted Nicholson's bills for £100, £200, and £200 (payable at various dates), and Nicholson will not draw any profits until these sums and others for bills by Nicholson shall have been paid. A covering letter specified what paper Bewly &amp; Gardiner should send. 92 Nicholson, Dictionary (1790): A receipt for £90 which, with £330 previously received, "is in full for the Copy right". 93 Nicholson, First Principles (1801): Nicholson promises "that the Printer shall be enabled by a proper Supply of Copy for the chemical Dictionary to proceed at the rate of three Sheets per week . . . and also that the first Principles of Chemistry shall be ready for press by the 10 th . of January next, under the penalty of two Guineas for every sheet of the Dictionary delayed, and fifty pounds in case the First Principles should not be ready as before mentioned". 94 Nicholson, First Principles (1792): A receipt "for superintending &amp; improving the New Edition", viz., for "revising and examining the work throughout and superintending the Printing" (£12.12.0), for "New Index &amp; Contents" (£3.13.6), and "New Discoveries &amp;c. added" (£4.14.6). 95 Oppenheim: A marginal note indicates when and what sums were paid, including "Corrections" (£2.10.6). A previous receipt for £10.10.0 of 28 April 1798 "for a translation" is presumably for the same work. 96 Palairet: This is a curious document recording that Mr Palairet was to be paid £105 "for his trouble of the new Atlas" and £31.10.0 "for Translation &amp; Corrections", "half to be paid when half the work is done and the rest of the Sum when finished"; there is no indication of with whom Mr Palairet was agreeing. On the verso is an account for "Engraving 23 plates for Maps at 4 Guineas" (£96.12.0), "23 Copper Plates at 12 s each" (£13.16.0), "33 Reams of Paper at 15 s " (£24.15.0), "Printing of 33 Reams at 3/6 p er hund[ red ]" (£28.9.0), plus "Drawings if any to be made to be paid for Separate" (£6.8.0), a total of £170. It may be related to his Atlas Mèthodique (London: Nourse &amp; Vaillant, 1775), A Concise Description of the English and French Possessions in North America , for the Better Explaining of the Map Published with that Title (London: Nourse, &amp;c., 1755), or A Map of North America (1765). 97 Payne: A Memorandum specifying that the book is to consist of thirty sheets "by estimation as agreeable to the Sheet exhibited as a specimen"; Robinsons are to have the whole rights to 1,500 copies, for which £31.10.0 and 100 copies are to be given to Payne; one half the copyright is to belong to the Robinsons "through all future editions which shall be printed upon a further payment being made for the same at the rate of two Guineas for every printed Sheet of which the s d book shall consist". A receipt of 21 Aug 1795 for £31.10.0 is in accordance with this memorandum, and another receipt of 7 Feb 1796 for £5.5.0 is "on Acc t of Geo 1 . Extracts", and another of 26 Feb 1796 for £15.15.0 is for the same purpose. 98 Pearson: The receipt is annotated: "NB I am to give Miss Pearson Twenty five Guineas more when I have cleared fifty Guineas by the Work / GR". The total was evidently quickly reached, for another receipt from GGJR of 6 May 1794 is for a total of £52.10.0. 99 Pickar: A receipt "for Translating Eighteen Sheets . . . at 18 s / p er Sheet". See note 83. 100 Pilon, Soldier : A receipt "in full for the Copy right . . . . But in Case of the Sale exceeding three thousand Copies twenty Guineas more are to be paid to me". Apparently the sale did exceed 3,000 copies with a 3rd Edition (1787), for a £21 demand-note of Fred. Pilon (1750-88) from Boulogne of 12 Jan 1787 is for "Value received" from GR, and another receipt of 19 Jan 1787 is also for £21. 101 Pilon, Ward : A receipt "on the same terms as my last Comedy viz. 'He would be a Soldier'". 102 Pote: A receipt for the work "bought by them at the Queen's Arms June 14 last". 103 Poulin: A receipt "in part payment for an English Translation . . . which I have agreed to sell them for thirty six Guineas and in case of their printing a Second Edition they are to pay me Twenty Guineas more". A separate receipt of 11 June 1789 for £18.18.0 makes the sum for the translation "in full". 104 Pyle: A receipt for £12.12.0 from GR &amp; R. Beatriffe, which, with £21 received before, makes £32.12.0 paid "in full of Demands and Requests". 105 Radcliffe: The MS, to be published within three months, is said to be "written by the said William Radcliffe and Ann his wife", though the titlepage, the National Union Catalog , and The Dictionary of National Biography credit only Ann. The document is docketted irrelevantly "Mysteries of Udolpho assignment from Ann Radcliff delivered to me May 29, 1821 from Longman Hurst &amp; Co". Robinson had paid £525 for the work, a previously unprecedented sum for a novel, according to [William West], Aldine Magazine , I (1839), 133. 106 Rayner, History : Articles of Agreement: The Robinsons will bear the costs, provide Rayner with "Books and paper", and advance him £21 now (below is a receipt therefore of the same day) which Rayner will repay if the publication is delayed longer than twelve months; half the profits are to go to Rayner. The first biography of the 1st Earl of Mansfield was apparently John Halliday's Life of William, Late Earl of Mansfield (1799). 107 Raynes: Memorandum of Agreement "for and on behalf of the several Proprietors of The Pocket Convenancer"; Raynes is to revise it, "particularly by inserting the Duchess of Ma[ r ]lbro's Will" and to have "a Present of two Setts". Below the date is a receipt for £5.5.0. 108 Reid: Receipt from John Nourse "by the hands of M r Andrew Millar", "Witness And: Millar". 109 Richardson: A promissory note to Mr Shute[?] Cox[?], with receipt. 110 Robson: A receipt "for half a thirtieth Share which I bought at the Queens Arms in S t .

Rogers 12 Sermons printed by my late Brother M r W m Innys to whom I am Executor". 112 Russell, Ancient Europe : A receipt "as part payment of Copy=money". A separate Memorandum of 24 Jan 1787 says that Russell "proposes to write a book entitled a Concise View of the History of Ancient Europe, with an Account of the principal Revolutions in Asia and Africa, from the Foundation of the Grecian States to the Subversion of the Roman Empire, to be comprehended in one hundred and ten sheets octavo the same size as the last Edition of his History of Modern Europe, which he offers to sell . . . at the rate of four Guineas a sheet, which offer the said G.R. accepts of—And they mutually agree to enter into a legal writing to the same effect, if either of the parties should think it necessary." Letters from Russell to Robinson of 21 April, 25 Nov 1788, 4 May, 5 Dec 1789, 20 Sept 1790, 2 Jan 1793 (Yale) are about the terms for publication of the Ancient and the Modern History . 113 Russell, Modern Europe (1784): A receipt which, with £168 before received, "is in full of the copy=money". 114 Schoen: The British Library catalogue, The National Union Catalog , and The London Stage , Part 5 (1968), 1268 say that John Scawen is the "supposed author" of New Spain . 115 Short: A receipt "being the Balance of the Account of my 'Dramas['] to this day". 116 Joseph Smith: A receipt "in full for the fourth part Share of Youth's Faithful monitor . . . assign'd me by Mr Serjeant". A separate receipt is for £5.5.0 paid by Joseph Smith 24 Aug 1768 to Henry Serjeant for a quarter share of The Youth's Faithful Monitor or The Young Man's Best Companion. The entry for Steel ( q.v. ) suggests the work is by Woolyer. 117 Thomson, Physicians Vade-Mecum : A receipt "in full for the Copy &amp; Copy-Right of a Book . . . which he is at Liberty to publish with what Additions, and under what Name he things proper". GR published The Physicians Vade Mecum in 1791 under the name of Joseph Townsend (1739-1816). 118 Thomson, Suetonius: The 18 Dec 1795 receipt says Thomson is "expecting that Mr Robinson will pay me five Guineas more in Two months after the work is published provided the Sale is good". 119 Thomson, Philip III (1783): A receipt for £10 which, with £60 received before, is "in full for all Demands I have on him [ not identified ] on account of the Share I have in the Composition &amp; Correction". The 3rd Edition (GGJJR, 1793) in 2 vols. specifies that "The first four books [ are ] by R. Watson. . . . The two last by W. Thomson". 120 Thomson, Philip III (1786): A receipt "for my Contribution &amp; Services to the Second Edition". 121 Thomson, Scandinavia : A receipt "in part payment of Two hundred &amp; ten pounds agreed on as Copy money for Letters from Scandinavia . . . or a MSS. to the purport of that Title". 122 Thomson, Dr William (1794): A receipt by David Walker from Mr Robinson "on account of D r . William Thomson". 123 Trapp: There were editions in the United States in 1796 and 1797. 124 Urtick: A receipt, annotated: "N B I am to have five guineas more when the profits from the sale of the above amount to that sum". 125 Vyse (1802): A receipt "in full of all demands up to the above date". "In the sale of Mr. Robinson's stock, the copyright alone of Vyse's Spelling , price one shilling, sold for 2,500 l. , besides an annuity of fifty guineas per annum, to poor old Vyse" ([William West], Aldine Magazine , 1 [1839], 134). 126 Wallis: A receipt for £21, "which with sixty received before is in full for the New Edition of Sydenham's Works prepared for the press by me". 127 Walsh: The British Library catalogue and the National Union Catalog list only one edition (GGJR, 1800). 128 Whitehead: A receipt for "an advance of half the probable profits". 129 Williams: A receipt for £5, "which with One Hundred Pounds paid before, is in full for the Copy right of my Daughters two volumes of Letters". A cheque in the modern printed form is with it from Helen Maria Williams in Paris 14 Oct 1802 for £100 paid by GJR. 130 Williamson: A memorandum for "Four full and equal twenty-fourth parts and shares . . . numbered 9, 10, 11 and 12 respectively". At the bottom is a receipt the same day for £400. An agreement of 2 Jan 1793 commits GR to buy these shares "when the average weekly profit shall amount to ten pounds a week for three months", Robinson being "exempted from all responsibility . . . for payment of the Stamp Duties—on failure of which this agreement may, if he requires it, be considered as void". Jas Parry was witness. 131 Withering (1790): A receipt to C. Matthews "on Acco t of D r Withering". In a note of 8 Dec 1783, Dr Withering begs Mr Robinson to give Dr Swediar two copies of Withering's [ Account of ] the Scarlet Fever [(1779)].</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Pound's Personae : From Manuscript to Print by C. G. Petter *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his recent edition of the Collected Early Poems of Ezra Pound Michael John King states that his is only the beginning of a definitive edition of the early poems, "for additional manuscript versions are very likely to be uncovered." 1 The manuscripts for Personae (Gallup A3, 1909), Pound's first important collection of poems have been at the University of Victoria since 1966, so I cannot claim that I am uncovering their existence. However, apart from an entry in the Union List of Manuscripts in Canadian Repositories the presence of these manuscripts in the University of Victoria Special Collections has not been publicized and they are therefore unknown to the majority of Pound scholars. A study of this significant archive sheds important new light on the development of Pound's design in Personae . The University of Victoria English Department and Library together acquired the Personae archive, as part of a larger Ezra Pound Collection in 1966 in order to provide research material for a recently initiated graduate program. 2 The Pound collection was purchased through the New York book dealer, Lew David Feldman. 3 Special Collections learned subsequently that the collection had been assembled by a Mr. Bromwell Ault Jr. of New York and that he had previously loaned the Personae archive to the Yale Rare Book Room for their Pound exhibition of 1956. In the Yale University Library Gazette of 1956 (30, no. 3, 126) the Personae archive is described as "the star attraction of the show", and its provenance is noted as: "given by Pound to his friend John Gould Fletcher". We can readily date this gift since the friendship between Pound and Fletcher was relatively brief: 1913-14. 4 We can also conjecture that the papers did not pass out of Fletcher's estate until after his death in 1950. The Personae archive must be one of the most complete archives for any book of an early twentieth century American poet, consisting, as it does, not only of preliminary drafts and printer's-copy drafts but also of four sets of proofs. But on first inspection the manuscripts would appear to be incomplete since there are no manuscript drafts for fifteen of the first sixteen poems which appeared in the published book. On closer inspection, however, it becomes apparent that Pound originally included with the manuscripts either a marked copy, or sheets from, his first book A Lume Spento , 1908. The fifteen missing poems are printed verbatim in Personae in exactly the same order as in the earlier book. Two new poems are inserted in the earlier sequence: "Praise of Ysolt" and "Tally-O"; the latter being added after the first set of proofs had been pulled. Since the printer or publisher numbered the manuscript printer's copy used to produce the first set of proofs we can conjecture that a printed copy from A Lume Spento would have been similarly numbered. The first poem in manuscript printer's copy, "Praise of Ysolt" is numbered [26], 27, 28, and the next numbered page of copy is, "At the Heart O' Me", 34. The gaps, 1-26 and 29-34 are exactly filled if the sheets of the poems and notes used from A Lume Spento are counted: the first eleven poems before "Praise of Ysolt" take twenty-five pages and the following four, before "At the Heart O' Me", take up five pages. Collation of those poems which first appeared in A Lume Spento with the first page proofs from Personae reveal exactly similar spellings, punctuations and typographical errors. It thus appears very probable that A Lume Spento furnished part of the printer's copy missing from the archive and that the only authorial copy missing is that for the preliminaries. The McPherson Library Special Collections has a copy of Canzoni and Ripostes which Pound marked and to which he added a table of the poems selected for the printer of the 1917 Lustra . . . with Earlier Poems . I suspect that somewhere there exists a marked copy of A Lume Spento with preliminaries and table of contents laid in, which provided the printer's copy for the first part of the 1909 Personae . Not only does the University of Victoria Personae archive provide a complete record for the poems and notes first published in 1909 but it also offers some additional insight into the formation and shaping of the book as a whole. On the verso of a half sheet identifying the characters in the first draft of "Marvoil" (bearing the archive code [E.P.Po.76]), there is found what appears to be an early plan for the book (see Plate No. 2). This plan outlines three sections: the first containing three poems from A Lume Spento ; the second, three poems from A Quinzaine for this Yule , and the third two new poems: "Marvoil" and "Picadilly". Connected with the last three poems in the plan are what appear to be notes for epigraphs to the poems: "Nel Biancheggiar" / Shelly 'Music when soft voices die'; "Marvoil" / — Browning Men and Women or Dramatists; and "Picadilly" / — Yeats— Cloths of Heaven. Critics of the early poems have already remarked the influences of these poets on Pound, but it is interesting to find Pound noting the connections himself. As the collection developed this original plan evidently was modified: the poems from A Quinzaine for this Yule were abandoned and the A Lume Spento and the new poems expanded. But the original concept of beginning with "Cino" or "La Fraisne" and ending with "Piccadilly" was maintained to the end. Nevertheless Pound was changing and adding poems within this framework right up to the last proof. The Personae archive contains 108 pages of holograph manuscript and typescript. Of the eighteen 'new poems' five are present in one draft; eleven in two drafts; and two in three drafts. As noted above one can determine which of these drafts form the printer's copy by the pencilled numbering from [26]-28; 34-74. Although many of these printer's-copy drafts are simple transcripts from earlier drafts, some of them have been revised and a few heavily edited. The drafts, exclusive of the printer's copy, are either heavily revised manuscript or the author's even more heavily annotated initial typescript or manuscript. The revisions reveal Pound honing down the poems and ridding them of superfluous lines or notes (see especially "At the Heart O' Me" and "An Idyl for Glaucus"). But there are also a few poems like "From Syria" and "In the Old Age of the Soul" where he makes changes to render the Provençal verse more archaic. The early drafts also reveal the author working out ideas and jotting notes on the versos of his poems for later clarification. Odd notes occur on the versos of several Mss. and the most important of these notes is the plan mentioned above. It is also interesting to find a draft of "Motif" a poem included in A Lume Spento but not in Personae , here entitled "Search". There is also a draft of "Roundel", unpublished in Pound's lifetime, and extant only in the San Trovaso Notebook, here found on the verso of an early draft of "Xenia". The inclusion of the latter with the archive is probably an accident brought about by recycling paper. Both Pound's final and his rejected readings are of exceptional interest to the textual critic for the way they reveal the steps towards his final design, particularly the notes which he decided not to publish (see below). The drafts of Personae are written on an incredibly diverse variety of paper stock: graph paper, paper torn from notebooks, mould-made rag paper with watermarks, and cheap typing paper. Two poems, "Occidit" and "Xenia", are written on foolscap paper torn from a notebook, the same size as the San Trovaso Notebook. (I am going from the illustration in M. J. King, p. 319.) Others can be grouped by watermarks. "An Idyl for Glaucus", "In Revolt", "And Thus in Nineveh" (1st draft), and "In the Old Age of the Soul" are all on paper watermarked OCEAN / MAIL / HM&amp;S /; "And Thus in Nineveh" (2nd draft), "Search", "The White Stag", and "In Durance" are on paper with the watermark 888 / and the device with a winged charioteer; "Tally-O" and "In Durance" are on Cardinal Bond; and the early draft "At the Heart O' Me" is written on bank bond marked "TRUSLOVE &amp; HANSON / SLOANE BANK / LONDON". It will be interesting to see whether some bibliographic sleuth can work out a chronology from this evidence in relation to other Pound drafts existing at Yale and elsewhere. Some help with the chronology is provided by the dates on various of the drafts, although these dates are not necessarily the dates of composition as King (p. 316) notes in reference to the San Trovaso Notebook date. The poems are dated as follows: "Alba Belingalis", Hamilton Lit., 1905; "From the Saddle", König Albert, Hight [ sic ] Sea, April 1906; "From Syria", Madrid, May 1906; "Praise of Ysolt", 19 April 1907; and "An Idyll for Glaucus", November 1908. The most interesting of these dates is that for "Praise of Ysolt" which appeared first in a shorter form ("Vana") in A Lume Spento , June 1908, and was later expanded in Personae , April 1909. Louis L. Martz raises the question of whether Pound expanded the poem after the publication of A Lume Spento or whether it was completed earlier and only the first part published in A Lume Spento . 5 Unfortunately, the answer provided by the date on the manuscript remains ambiguous because of Pound's note in pencil on the second page of the typescript "Contine for p. 30 A.L.S." [ A Lume Spento ]. "Vana" appears on p. 30 of A Lume Spento so this note at least was post-publication, just as the text appears to be. Thus the date which appears on the manuscript may be the date of the original composition of "Vana" or it may be the date of the original composition of the whole poem. The date for the composition of "Praise of Ysolt" thus remains puzzling. The chronology of the four sets of Personae proofs that complete the picture of the book's development is much clearer. The first two sets are duplicates of each other; they are almost identically heavily revised by the author, but they can be distinguished from each other by pencil markings on their half-title pages: one is marked "Final" (evidently the one returned by Pound to the printer's) and the other is marked "Dup" (indicating the duplicate set retained by the author). The "Dup" is also marked "1" and was issued on 13 March, 1909. Pound obviously scrutinized these first sets of proofs very carefully. They were, after all, for his first important collection of poems published in England. The most radical revisions are to his notes and particularly to the section appended to the poems: "Notes on New Poems". (Notes were also dropped from "Xenia", "An Idyl for Glaucus", "In Revolt", and "In Durance" by being excised in proofs.) The most interesting excisions are those from the notes to "Guillaume de Lorris Belated: A Vision of Italy" on pages 58 and 59 of the first edition. From note 2 Pound cut the following (my italics) after the phrase, "as I have not the Benjamin Minor by me": " but the distinction once understood is never lost ". Furthermore, after the sentence, "Following St. Victor's figure of radiation: Poetry in its acme is expression from contemplation" he struck out: " A poem is an algebraic formula for spiritual or human truths , expressing as do the formulae of analytical geometry not one particular figure but the ideal of the figure . Thus a 2 + b 2 = c 2 gives the ideal of the circle's circumference ; or ( a-r ) 2 + ( b-r ) 2 = ( c-r ) 2 gives the circle of any radius , infinite or infinitesmal , in any quadrant . And if a man's mathematics can teach him to think in this fashion , and not after the fashion 3 X 3 + 4 X 4 = 5 X 5 then it is worth all the grind that he may give to it ." This omission is revealing. It looks as if Pound cut this treatise because he thought it too complex to explain at length or because he was on uncertain ground with his mathematics. The formula a 2 + b 2 = c 2 does not refer to the circle's circumference but rather to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. The second formula does refer to the area of the circle's quadrants, but its relation to the earlier formula is not really discernible. This mathematical explanation of the various levels of poetic truth was central to Pound's thought as has been well illustrated by Forrest Read's excellent article "The Mathematical Symbolism of Ezra Pound's Revolutionary Mind", Paideuma , VII, 1 &amp; 2, (1978), 7-73. Mr. Read notes (pp. 10-11) that Pound applied a mathematical analogy to explain the four levels of meaning in Dante's Comedy in The Spirit of Romance (1910), just as he used it here to explain the three levels of meaning of Richard St. Victor's figure of radiation. The presence of this note in the original draft of the notes for "Vision of Italy" shows how far Pound's ideas of a mathematical paradigm for poetic understanding had developed by 1909. Other notes were apparently cut because he wished to hide his vagueness about the origin of the idea. Thus he cut a note from p. 59 giving the source of the line "that white-footed wind, pale Dawn's annunciatrice": Straight steal from Dante. (I think the "Earthly Paradise", but I cannot find the passage .) Also in "Glaucus" the "two-foot coursairs" is "bipeded equos" from the "Pervigilium Veneris ". The first of these two passages is in fact from Dante's La Divina Commedia Purgatorio Canto XXV, 145, 6 while the second is a quote from the anonymous Latin poem which Pound cites, line 8. Finally, Pound cut the subtitle from "Marvoil": "A song of real people." Aside from Pound's decision to excise some of his notes, there are several minor substantive changes in the first proofs. But there are a plethora of spelling and punctuation corrections and emendations, more than 120 in all. Many of the spelling corrections were made to correct Pound's eccentric American renderings of words, e.g., "Tho" for though and "thru" for through, but also "coursairs" for coursers. Not only does Pound anglicize spellings and repunctuate (some in answer to proofreader's queries) but he also comments on the general book design, type sizes, blank pages, running titles and spacing of individual lines and words. In this regard it is interesting to note how Pound agonized over the lineation of the famous dedication to Mary Moore. At first he decided to change the layout to three lines of uniform size type but in the end opted to leave it the way it was originally set and finally published: as four lines with MARY MOORE in a larger face. Some major additions were also made in these first proofs. Four poems were added: "Tally-O" (4 lines), "Search" (7 lines), "And Thus in Nineveh" (23 lines), and "The White Stag" (7 lines). The addition of the first two poems did not have any bearing on the pagination. "Search" fitted perfectly into the blank space under "Occidit" while the first two stanzas of "Ballad for Gloom" had to be moved from p. 31 to p. 32 to accommodate "Tally-O". The addition of the last two poems was brought about by moving "Piccadilly" to the other side of the leaf (from p. 55 to p. 56). In this way not a single leaf had to be added. These additions show how shrewdly Pound made use of the space he had at his disposal without diminishing the aesthetic feeling created by the fine type-setting and layout of the Chiswick Press. In these proofs Pound also ironed out a minor mixup caused by the misnumbering of the Mss. of "In Durance" which had resulted in the setting of the third and fourth stanzas before the first two. Pound also insured that his name be printed in larger type on the title page and made the following note above the dedication: "Italic one line here 'Make-strong old dreams lest this our world lose heart'." As one becomes aware of these changes the realization grows of just how self-conscious Pound was about the production of this small volume. 7 The second proofs, again consisting of two sets, only one of which is marked by Pound, confirm the impression of self-conscious tinkering created by the first. These proofs were issued only a week after the first according to the date they bear: 19.3.09. In the set revised by Pound, marked "2 Rev d ", there are still efforts to rearrange individual spacing of words, most notably on the title page. There are twelve substantive or semi-substantive corrections; (notwithstanding the deletion of notes); at least one suggested by the publisher, Elkin Mathews, and about forty-six accidental corrections to spelling and punctuation. Throughout both sets the copy editor is also at work querying readings, adding the publishing date and moving the printing information to the colophon. He jots on the front page, supposedly for the printer, "2 Rev d /a, B-D / on our paper" and another note I cannot decipher. From there it was in the hands of the Chiswick Press. According to Pound's bibliographer, Donald Gallup, "1000 sets of sheets [were] printed (of which an undetermined number—not more than 500— were issued as part of Personae and Exultations (1913))."" 8 It appears likely that the numerous markings on the second proofs in a shaky small hand are those of Elkin Mathews, the publisher. The University of Victoria Special Collections was fortunate in acquiring, in the same accession as the Personae archive, some of Pound's letters to Elkin Mathews, 1909-11. The most illuminating item in relation to the Personae archive is an envelope, addressed to Mathews and postmarked 19 March 1909, the exact date of the second proofs. On the verso of this envelope are holograph notes, I presume Mathews', which refer by pages to queries which were marked on the text of the second proofs. This would seem to indicate that Mathews personally supervised the marking of the second and possibly also the first proofs. 9 The University of Victoria Mathews' correspondence also provides some corroborating evidence and a date for Homer Pound's famous story about how his son Ezra approached Mathews to publish Personae . As this colourful anecdote relates directly to the original disposition of the manuscripts being described I will repeat it here. "When he'd spent every cent he'd saved out of his allowance, he walked into a little bookshop in London and handed the manuscript of a book of poems, Personae , to the owner, Elkin Mathews, who had 'discovered' Yeats. "'If you can make an advance payment on this manuscript,' said Mr. Mathews, after he'd read it, 'I might consider bringing it out.' 'Well,' said Ezra, 'I've only got a shilling, but you're welcome to that if you want it.' 'No, never mind,' said Mr. Mathews, 'I want to bring out the book anyway.'" 10 Evidence concerning this anecdote is provided by the following letter, (E.P.C.76): 35, Park Lane W. February 20th 09 Dear Sir, Mr. George Wyndham desires me to thank you for letting him see the poems by Ezra Pound, and to express his regret that owing to his numerous political engagements he is unable to accede to your request. I return the poems herewith. yours faithfully, G. King Sec y Elkin Mathews Esq. Mathews was evidently seeking George Wyndham, a prominent politician and man of letters as a reader for the publication of Personae . Three years before Wyndham had published an essay on Ronsard with a few selections of verse translations of Provençal verse. Whether or not Mathews was able to find other knowledgeable readers for the volume or went ahead on his own initiative cannot be established and it would be interesting to learn whether there is any further correspondence of this nature in other Pound archives. What follows is a description of the manuscripts and proofs in the University of Victoria, McPherson Library, Special Collections. This includes a list of only the most important substantive corrections in each poem, in the drafts and proofs. No effort has been made to list the many accidental variations described in general above. It is hoped that these descriptions together with my general observations on the manuscripts will pave the way for a definitive edition of the 1909 Personae . Throughout the following list my numbering, and manner of listing, is similar to that used by Michael King in his edition of the Collected Early Poems of Ezra Pound . Variants listed in angle-brackets were crossed out in the draft and replaced by readings in the published version; while those not in angle-brackets were written in without being crossed out. All my remarks have been italicized to distinguish them from the remarks actually excised. The page and line numbering is keyed to King's text so that readers can check the variants against the 'established' text. Line numbers are calculated by counting from the top of King's pages, exclusive of titles, subtitles or notes. Transcriptional errors which Pound crossed out of his later drafts have not been recorded.

      <field name="heading_text">The Hengwrt and Ellesmere Manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales : Different Scribes by Roy Vance Ramsey</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A vexed question in Chaucer studies is the exact relationship of the two best manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales, Hengwrt (Peniarth 392 D) and Ellesmere. Although the two manuscripts have been shown by John M. Manly and Edith Rickert to be only occasionally affiliated in their text, 1 paleographers in the past have identified the handwriting of the two as that of the same scribe. An adaptation of the techniques of compositor identification, however, has provided the means for subjecting the manuscripts to statistical tests. The results not only seem to settle the question of the number of scribes copying the two manuscripts but also seem to offer at least one reason why the two differ materially in the quality of their texts: Hengwrt and Ellesmere were copied by different scribes with different habits of registering certain accidentals, different habits of proofing finished copy, and different habits of registering substantive readings. The present study was begun more than six years ago in the midst of working on the Variorum Chaucer project. The appearance of the Hengwrt manuscript (hereafter called 'Hg') reproduction, transcription, and full registration of the variants in the Ellesmere manuscript (hereafter called 'El') provides the means for a general testing of the present study's rejection of the claim that the two manuscripts were copied by the same scribe. 2 In their exhaustive study of the manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales , Manly and Rickert say of the scribal hand in Hg, "A large, clear book hand, probably the same throughout. . . . Paleographers believe the scribe to have written El also; the same variations in appearance occur in both" (I, 268). This belief that the same scribe copied Hg and El throughout is reiterated by A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes in their "Paleographical Introduction" to the First Fascicle (pp. xix-xlix). Taken by itself, this reinforcement by two scholars as expert in fifteenth-century paleography as Doyle and Parkes might seem to put the matter to rest. In another part of their study, however, Manly and Rickert say of the paleographical evidence: "Several scribes trained by the same master may seem to be a single scribe. The writing in El is so much like that in Hg and the writing in each is subject to such variations that some of the best experts cannot decide whether both are the work of the same scribe, or both the work of the same two, or each the work of a different writer. Even if two scribes working on the same MS normally write very differently, one may try to imitate the other when he continues to work" (I, 23). Doyle and Parkes also indicate the possibility of such differences in a scribe going undetected in a footnote which states in part, "R. Vance Ramsey has shown us some statistics of the variations, which need further discussion." 3 The present study begins this "further discussion" by providing much fuller sets of statistics than those seen by Doyle and Parkes and by arguing that, as undeniably expert as they are in English medieval paleography, the statistics and some other differences to be discussed later refute their identification of the Hg and El scribes as one. The importance of this question for the textual criticism and editing of the Canterbury Tales will be discussed in the last part of the study. Basic to any attempt to study two manuscripts whose handwriting seems identical are the points made simply by Charlton Hinman concerning compositors: ". . . if two or more compositors set type for a given book, two or more sets of spelling habits are likely to be discoverable in it. . . . The later text always reproduces some copy spellings, but many changes are made, and these changes generally leave no doubt whatever as to the spelling preferences of the compositors who alone can be responsible for them." 4 Similarly, Manly and Rickert discovered in the manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales "consistency in adhering to a spelling system" and noted: "Even the less regular scribes show some points of preference; and others, especially some of the best and earliest, are characterized by a fairly complete standardization. [¶] The reasons for this lie in the obvious fact that writers were taught in schools or trained in shops, and that they inevitably formed habits in spelling as in writing" (I, 558). While taking the Manly-Rickert evidence and analyses into account, the present study shares certain premises with such compositor-studies as that of Hinman: both recognize the likelihood of variability in spelling-habits by different compositors and scribes; both recognize that the spellings of the exemplars will at times be brought forward unchanged and that the percentage of such spellings left unchanged will vary from one man to another and even from one locus to another; thus, both kinds of study depend heavily on the law of averages. The present study, however, depends far more heavily on this law and on sheer numbers. This need for large numbers is explained after presenting the first chart. The chart below follows six words through the 500 pages (250 leaves) of Hg and the corresponding spellings in El. The chart differs from those in compositor studies in not detailing the occurrences page by page or quire by quire. This is for the simple reason that analysis of the various ways copy might be apportioned to scribes (leaf by leaf, gathering by gathering, or tale by tale) has shown that the systematic variations in spelling persist from one leaf to another, from one gathering to another, and from one tale to another (although there are occasional anomalies in the counts from the latter which are discussed later). A demonstration of the point about the differences in spelling persisting from one tale to another is provided for the first word on the chart, thou . After that word the others are simply given as totals for reasons of space; however, a comparable regularity obtains for all.

This word occurs slightly more often than once per page, and four-fifths of the time Hg spells it thow at the place where El spells it thou . Putting together all of the occurrences shows an even more striking opposition: in 515 opportunities to spell the word, the Hg scribe spells it thow 482 times (or 93% of the spellings) and the El scribe spells it thou 440 times (85.4%). The second word ( else ) offers even more striking testimony (allowing for its occurring only a fifth as often as thou ): the Hg scribe never spells the word elles , whereas the El scribe spells it ellis only 11.3% of the time. The first point explains why the other two possible combinations ( elles/ellis and elles/elles ) never occur. While all possible combinations of thogh and though do occur (plus 8 other such combinations as theigh/though ), once again Hg shows a marked preference for one spelling ( thogh 179 times, or 85% of the spellings), while El prefers the other ( though 141 times, or 67%). Also, a few of Hg's though spellings are in the rhyme position at the end of the line, and Hg almost always spells the rhyming portion of two words in such a place the same. The words down and town have identical vowel sounds, of course; yet in 137 occurrences El never spells the former word down (compare the 85% preference for thou ), while he spells the latter town 8 times out of 50 occurrences. Hg, on the other hand, uses ou 2 to 1 in doun , but ow 3 to 1 in town (compare the 93% preference for thow ). The word atte , standing for at the , is familiar to readers of Chaucer because of past editors' dependence on El, which uses it 55 out of 71 times (77.5% of the time). Hg, conversely, spells out at the 37 times and registers atte 34 times (El has at once where Hg has at the and once where Hg has atte ). Although not occurring with the frequency of do , go , and here , then, the words on the chart above do seem to show marked and opposed tendencies on the parts of the copyists of Hg and El; nevertheless, certain evidence available to the student of the First Folio is not available for the study of Hg and El. No exemplar of either manuscript exists (unless Hg did serve as El's exemplar for the Friar's Tale , as Manly and Rickert believe possible). 6 Also, there is no 'evidence of the case' which serves compositor-studies so well. Most important, while compositor-studies generally deal with different compositors working from the same copy, this study does not. (Manly and Rickert's analyses show that the use of the same exemplar for two extant manuscripts is the exception rather than the rule.) These differences explain the need mentioned before to study large numbers of occurrences, larger than the chart above of 'characteristic words' can provide: some of the differences in spelling registered must stem from the exemplars (such as the theigh/though contrast already mentioned) but, with the possible exception of the Friar's Tale , no exemplars have survived. Some of these differences, then, might stem from the same scribe faithfully registering different spellings in each exemplar; indeed, the marked difference in the Knight's Tale spellings of thou suggests that El is copying there from an exemplar with the word spelled thow a larger-than-usual percentage of the time (25 out of 58 times, El spells thow , compared with 50 out of 457 times elsewhere). The regularity of the other instances of thou and thow , on the other hand, makes it unlikely that this change stems from a variation in habit. The scribes of Hg and El must have trained and worked in the same shop, a point to be returned to in connection with their identical-appearing hands. The solution to this problem of a need for large numbers to counter the lack of other resources available for compositor-studies and the identical look of the hands seems to lie in studying the scribes' graphic (whether they cross a final h or flourish a final d ) and graphemic habits (their ways of representing sounds and combinations of sounds such as - er - and that ). The statistics of graphic and graphemic variations between Hg and El were gathered in two ways. The first way, represented on the chart which follows, was to count all the variations noted in all the lines of Hg and the corresponding lines of El in the course of working on the transcription of Hg and the corresponding lines of El for the First Fascicle. Because the number of variants watched for was so large (forty-plus) and because the counting was done in the midst of other work, the accuracy of the statistics is somewhat less than it might have been (unlike the 'characteristic words' which were recounted twice for this study). Spot-checks have shown the percentage of errors to range from o to 20%, with perhaps 10% as an average. That this percentage of error does not negate the import of the differences registered is shown by the chart below, where the percentages of the ten variants registered TALE GRAPHIC AND GRAPHEMIC CONTRASTS IN THE HENGWRT AND ELLESMERE MANUSCRIPTS (Dominant Contrast/Reversal) (Hg (order) 1. h/ h 2. d/ d 3. -ogh/-ough 4. -ow-/-ou- 5. &amp;/and 6. -on/-ou n 7. that /that 8. single vowel/double 9. -ay-/-eye- 10.

O/-n 387/188 (67.3%); 14. with/ with 222/146 (60.3%) fully range from 76.8 to 99.3%. The range of the four variants listed at the bottom of the chart is from 60.3 to 72%. Another way of counting was to take 100 lines from each tale in Hg (the third fifty from the beginning and from the end where possible) plus the General Prologue (Pro) and the Wife of Bath's Prologue (listed with WBT). This second way of counting, like the spot-checks of individual variants throughout a tale, showed that the statistics on the chart had less of an incidence of error than the occasion of their gathering might have suggested. Of the fourteen contrasts on the chart above, some require explanations because print cannot reproduce them: the italicized h stands for a 'crossed h' at the end of a word; d stands for a 'flourished d'—a 'd' with a tilde attached to the top of the riser—at the end of a word; '&amp;' is the still-used Tironian sign for et ; -ou n stands for 'ou' in a word followed by a nasal mark; that stands for the Old English letter 'thorn' followed by an elevated 't'; -er- stands for the brevigraph used in place of that syllable; and with stands for 'w' followed by an elevated 't'. Except for the O standing for absence where a final -e or final -n stands, the other variations seem self-explanatory. The most obvious difference between this chart and the first one is that all occurrences are not listed. This difference rests on both the feasibility and the desirability of such a listing. Although it is simple enough to count when Hg has a single vowel in a word where El has two or vice versa, any attempt to list all occurrences would come very close to listing all the words having the relevant one of the five basic vowel letters (graphemes) in English. Final -e and final -n occurrences and absences would be similar cases. Beyond this difficulty there is a very real question about the need or even the desirability of listing all the words where the two manuscripts are spelling alike. The Hg scribe's total rejection of elles is the unique exception in this study (he must know that it is an option, his identical hand showing him to be working in the same shop with the El scribe). Given the very probable spelling-variation in his exemplars and the certain information which El provides that the variation between ellis and elles was in keeping with shop-practice, even this one invariable spelling is more striking than it might otherwise seem. Nevertheless, Hinman is right that some of the spellings (such as theigh ) will be brought forward from the exemplar, so that some variability in spelling is guaranteed by several scribes' separately and in varying combinations making the intevening copies between Chaucer's holographs of various tales and the copying done for Hg and El. The question, then, is not variability (which was inevitable) but tendency : if the same scribe did copy the many thousands of lines in each manuscript, then whatever the reasons for his variations in spelling, his tendency to use a particular grapheme for a particular sound or sound-combination should be apparent in any very large count. If El much more often has a final -e or a final -n on the same word in the same place where Hg does not have it, then whatever the reason for its presence in one manuscript and absence in the other, a marked difference in tendency is clear. Even more important than the numbers and percentages recorded at the bottom of the chart is the overall consistency in the ratios from one tale to another of the variants and their reversals. Early in this study, one consideration which prompted the counting of variants in all the lines rather than sampling lines was the possibility that the work on either or both of the manuscripts had been done by more than one scribe. Such apportionment of the copying (the forerunner of printing-house practice) would presumably have shown up in smaller patterns within the larger ones. The striking reversal of the single vowel/double vowel pattern in the General Prologue (Pro) and the Knight's Tale (KtT) looked as though it might be such an indication. A look at the other variants in the two pieces, however, shows the same ratios as those prevalent elsewhere. Some of the smaller anomalous ratios on the chart may well stem from the variability of scribal habit, but such reversals as the single vowel/double vowel ones seem to involve enough instances and a complete enough change in the dominant patterns as to stem mainly from the exemplars being copied rather than from some variability in scribal habit. A difference in exemplar having been admitted as the probable cause of the anomalous patterns (or at least of those where relatively large numbers are involved), the question may well be raised of why this difference in exemplars does not explain the variant ratios generally. There are three major reasons and a minor one why the patterns point to a difference in scribes rather than a difference in exemplars as the primary explanation of the ratios: the nature of accidentals, the regularity of the ratios tale by tale, the shifting textual affiliations of El, and a local but striking instance where both scribes are probably copying from the same exemplar. The nature of such accidentals as spelling, the use of a brevigraph, the use of &amp; in place of and , and so forth is that a writer gives much less thought to them than to such questions about substantives as whether the word in his exemplar is fore or sore (the initial f and long s being particularly easy to confuse). The chart seems to have more than enough data to show that different scribes with different habits were involved in copying the two manuscripts; on the other hand, such complete reversals of the dominant patterns as that involving the single and double vowels in the General Prologue and the Knight's Tale and that involving the spelling -on or -ou n in the latter (18 of 42 reversals occur in this tale) seem to indicate that at times the spellings of the exemplars were registered more often than the scribe's own habitual ones. Similarly, the Corpus Christi 198 (Cp) and Lansdowne 851 (La) manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales , which are very close textually, show mixtures of exemplar patterns and scribal habits of spelling and of registering other accidentals. Such an alternation between a scribe's following his exemplar's spellings and his own spelling-habits should cause a fairly constant minority (stemming from the exemplar) of reversals of the dominant patterns, a smaller number of complete reversals, and should rule out more than one or two invariables in manuscripts of this length—just the pattern which the chart displays. The second basic reason for rejecting the exemplars as the source of the variations between Hg and El in accidentals is the regularity of these variations. The chart demonstrates this regularity tale by tale, and, as noted, samplings were made throughout for smaller patterns—which never appeared. This study relies, as did Manly and Rickert's classification of manuscripts, upon "the regularity of the operations of chance in mass phenomena," upon "the doctrine of probability" (II, 23). The case offered by the 'characteristic words' chart was undermined by the relatively small numbers involved. The combination of number of contrasts, number of tales, and regularity of results in the second chart presents in itself a case of high probability. The third basic reason that the differences on the chart cannot stem from differences in the exemplars of Hg and El is the latter's shifts of textual affiliation. This is a point more amply demonstrated by Manly and Rickert in the tale-by-tale analyses of variants in Volume II, but a brief account may be useful. Manly and Rickert discovered that even the early manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales tend to change textual affiliation from one tale or group of tales to another (Hg and El date with the earliest). The textual affiliations of El in the Man of Law's Tale and the Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale can illustrate such shifts. For the Man of Law's Tale , the El scribe copied an exemplar much like the ones used by the scribes of the Fitzwilliam (Fi), Phillips 8136 (Ph 2 ), British Museum Additional 35286 (Ad 3 ), Christ Church CLII (Ch), Bodleian 686 (Bo 2 ), and the a family of manuscripts. For the Wife of Bath's Prologue , on the other hand, the El scribe copied from an exemplar related to those used for Cambridge Gg.4.27 (Gg), Sion College (Si), and the Bodleian 414 ( Bo 1 ) and Egerton 2864 ( En 3 ) groups of manuscripts up to line 387 . Then, at line 388 the El scribe's exemplar shifted (or he changed exemplars) to a textual relationship with the exemplars of the Royal College of Physicians manuscript (Py) and the a and augmented b * groups of manuscripts. In the Wife of Bath's Tale , the El exemplar remained textually affiliated with the a and augmented b * groups, but the Py scribe's exemplar shifted to another affiliation, while the Bo 2 exemplar shifted to affiliation with El again. Needless to say, shifts like these must have disconcerted Manly and Rickert. They concluded that such shifts even in early manuscripts of high textual quality such as El must have been caused by the earlier piecemeal issuance of tales and groups of tales during Chaucer's later life (with subsequent losses of leaves to explain the shifts in the early part of the General Prologue and such a shift as that at line 388 of the Wife of Bath's Prologue ). This shifting and piecemeal issuance explain why, although Hg and El contain the two best extant texts of the Canterbury Tales virtually throughout, these two manuscripts are textually affiliated only six times: the Friar's Tale , the Summoner's Tale (through line 1991), the Monk's Tale , the Nun's Priest's Tale (but not the prologue—and Manly and Rickert vary about the tale itself), the Manciple's Tale , and the Clerk's Tale . An instance where the Hg and El scribes are copying either the same exemplar or ones separated by no more than one copying provides the opportunity to see the respective habits overbearing the accidentals of the exemplar. For this purpose the accidentals of the copies of the same exemplar will be compared with those made of exemplars which have no relationship short of the original scribal copy of Chaucer's holograph (O). Of the Reeve's Tale , Manly and Rickert state, "Hg and El probably have no common ancestor short of O" (II, 159). Of the Friar's Tale , on the other hand, they say, "For the first time Hg and El are together. . ." (II, 225). They think that the exemplar is so close to O, in fact, that they venture this comment at the end of their analysis of the Friar's Tale variants in Hg and El: "From the mistakes in the ancestor of Hg-El and related MSS, it is clear that Chaucer did not correct his text with much care" (II, 225). The fact that El changes its textual closeness to Hg at line 1991 puts them of two minds about how probable it is that the exemplar used by the Hg scribe for the first half of the Summoner's Tale is the same one used by the El scribe. The two tales seem to have been issued as a unit (naturally enough in view of their being the expressions of a quarrel between the two men): "Hg and El are apparently from an V Hg-El [common ancestor] in FrPT . . . and SuPT to 1991 . . ." (I, 150). Later, they state, "Through 1991, then, aside from the editorial efforts in El, Hg and El are not very different in quality; from 1991 the difference is enormous" (II, 239). While Manly and Rickert stop short of affirming that Hg and El used the same exemplar up to line 1991, they do state of the misreadings which Hg and El share, "It may be observed . . . that the six misreadings are suggestive of the use of the same exemplar" (II, 239). At any rate the closeness of the text of Hg and El in the Friar's Tale and the Summoner's Tale to line 1991 and the distance of their texts in the Reeve's Tale and the Summoner's Tale , lines 1992-2294, should manifest themselves in the accidentals if such differences do stem from a single scribe's having copied very different exemplars for Hg and for El. The range of differences in substantives which allows decisions about nearness or distance of textual affiliation should be matched by a similar range of differences in accidentals if the scribe is simply registering those he finds in very different exemplars. The comparison follows: VARIANT SuT, lines 1665-1991 SuT, lines 1992-2294 SuT, TOTAL FrT ReT --- --- --- --- --- --- thow/thou 7/0 9/0 16/0 23/0 2/0 1. h/ h 31/0 33/0 64/0 18/1 15/1 2. d/ d 4/0 12/0 16/0 10/0 15/1 3. -ogh/-ough 5/0 1/0 6/0 2/0 5/0 4. -ow-/-ou- 5/0 9/0 14/0 1/3 1/4 5. &amp;/and 0/1 0/1 0/2 2/1 1/2 6. -on/-ou n 2/0 1/0 3/0 2/0 0/0 7. that /that 1/14 3/6 4/20 2/13 29/2 8. single vowel/double 24/7 20/7 44/14 26/2 40/13 9. -ay-/-ey- 6/1 1/0 7/0 0/1 6/3 10. O/-e 16/2 14/11 30/13 17/6 28/9 As with the other charts, there are anomalies in the distribution, notably in the distribution of that /that, which may stem from the exemplars; but, given the matter of closeness or distance of textual affiliation, they probably stem from variation in scribal habit. The important point about this chart is that the preponderance of the ratios is the same whether the Hg and El scribes are copying from the same or very similar exemplars in the Friar's Tale and the Summoner's Tale to 1991 or whether they are copying from very different ones in the Reeve's Tale and the Summoner's Tale after line 1991. Returning for a moment to the earlier chart, one pattern there is not immediately evident: Hg has the sign &amp; where El writes out the word and 768 times to 113 of the reverse. The most striking anomalies of all occur with this variant: while the overall ratio is 768/113, the ratio in Melibeus is 429/19 and in the Parson's Tale , 287/6. When these two counts are subtracted, the ratio reverses to 52/88. This is a case where a major break in the pattern actually reinforces the point of different scribes: Melibeus and the Parson's Tale are the two prose works in the Canterbury Tales ; therefore, when the Hg scribe is copying poetry, he is slightly less likely than the El scribe to use the sign for and (52/88), but when he is copying prose, he is twenty-eight times more likely to use the sign (716/25). The evidence seems clear, then: the major source of the differences in accidentals between Hg and El is not in the exemplars of each but in the scribe of each. If we accept that these differences stem from the scribe, the question still may be raised of a possible change of habits. Once again, the figures can only point to probabilities; but, once again, the probabilities are quite high against a change in habits as consistent and widespread as this would have been. In the first place, no more than a decade can have intervened between the copying of Hg and El (the loss of part of the Summoner's Tale between the two copyings being a portion of the evidence for the sequence); a much shorter interval is likely. Second, Hg and El are in a professional book hand which was somewhat old-fashioned in the early fifteenth century. To put down the difference charted to changes in habit would require us to imagine that a perhaps middle-aged scribe who had earned his livelihood by daily copying for a number of years greatly changed fourteen-plus of his copying habits during the few years after he copied Hg. On the contrary, as engrained as middle-aged habits tend to be generally, the copying-habits of a middle-aged scribe should be especially set. The source of the widespread, systematic differences between Hg and El in their accidentals is not to be found in their different exemplars nor in a single scribe's greatly changing his habits in mid-life: the source is the difference in scribes. There are still two questions raised by this rejection of the paleographical evidence in favor of different scribes' having copied the two manuscripts: (1) how the writing of different scribes can be so alike as to escape the detection of expert paleographers; (2) given this possibility that different scribes can escape detection, whether more than one might not have been involved in the production of either or both Hg and El. The answer to how the handwriting of different scribes can be in effect identical relates to the aims of the best professional scribes: "Several scribes trained by the same master may seem to be a single scribe," as Manly and Rickert state (I, 23), because they were trained to seem so. The point of training for such identity of hand was so that when the work of copying a single manuscript was apportioned among two or more of them, no differences would be evident after their portions were put together. This is why Manly and Rickert discovered that "some of the best experts" could not settle the question of the number of scribes copying Hg and El. What, then, of the second question: if more than one scribe evaded detection by expert paleographers between Hg and El, might not more than one have copied one or both manuscripts and still have evaded the present count of variants? This seems possible but not probable. That same regularity of contrasts tale after tale which points to separate copyists of Hg and El also points to a single set of habits operating upon each manuscript. The few anomalies involving relatively large numbers may give us pause, but their kind and occurrence seem too random to point to smaller patterns. Particular attention was paid in the various counts within tales to those with such anomalies, but no smaller pattern emerged. If two scribes did copy either Hg or El, then one was the imitator of the other (perhaps the apprentice rather than the partner) not only in handwriting but in his habits of registering accidentals as well—and thus quite possibly not detectable at all. This question, however, is of much less moment than that of different scribes' having copied Hg and El because of one last difference in scribal habits—the treatment of substantives. The discovery that different scribes with significantly different habits copied Hg and El is important in much the same way that similar studies of compositors' habits are: the differences in scribal habits extended beyond the accidentals to substantives and resulted in significant differences in the textual quality of each manuscript, apart from the textual quality of their respective exemplars. Let it be clear that this difference in the textual quality of Hg and El was well understood by Manly and Rickert and that they tried to convey the import of the difference: "Although El has long been regarded by many scholars as the single MS of most authority, its total of unique variants, many of which are demonstrable errors, is approximately twice that of Hg, as is also its total of slips shared with other MSS by acco [accidental coincidence of variants in unaffiliated manuscripts; the Manly-Rickert abbreviation is used throughout this study]. And again, while it has a few lines not in any other MS, and shows some editorial changes that could have been made by Chaucer, it has many others that are questionable and some distinctly for the worse, even involving misunderstanding of the context. Since it is very clear that an intelligent person, who was certainly not Chaucer, worked over the text while El was copied, the unsupported readings of this MS must be scrutinized with the greatest care" (I, 150). Of Hg, on the other hand, Manly and Rickert state: "Because of its great freedom from accidental errors and its entire freedom from editorial variants, Hg is a MS of the highest importance" (I, 276). These are important statements with important implications, not only for the present study but also for the general understanding and editing of the text of the Canterbury Tales . Editors still far too freely use El variants, given the Manly-Rickert analyses and their "Corpus of Variants." While such is a study in itself, a measure of the neglect of Manly-Rickert's analyses and data by editors is the use of El as the base-text of the Canterbury Tales in one of the latest editions of Chaucer's works. 7 In light of work done on the Variorum Chaucer and given Manly and Rickert's analyses of the manuscript variants tale by tale in Volume II, even the above-quoted characterizations of the two manuscripts seemed restrained, so a count was made. Going through these Volume II analyses revealed that Manly and Rickert's estimate of the "total of unique variants" in El as "twice that of Hg" was apparently based on impression, on an early count, or on the ratio of the total number of variants, by acco as well as unique. Leaving out the Canon's Yeoman's Tale (which is not in Hg) and the Parson's Tale (only partially present in Hg) and counting the rest revealed the following contrasts: El's total variants (unique and by acco , leaving out those by affiliation) is 1440 to Hg's total of 809; El's unique variants number 249 to Hg's total of 47. While El's total number of variants which comparison of affiliated manuscripts shows cannot stem from its exemplar, that is, almost matches the estimate of double the number of Hg, the actual ratio of unique variants is more than five times the number in Hg . As this difference in ratio suggests, the number of unique variants in a manuscript has different implications than does the number of variants by acco . Many of the variants in a manuscript stem from its exemplar: the more changes which were made by the scribe of the exemplar and by the scribes of the ancestor-manuscripts, the more variants which will be copied unintentionally by the present scribe ('variant' has been chosen over 'error' as the more neutral word). In addition, each copying of an exemplar of any length inevitably introduces new variants because of mistakes of the copyist. The Canterbury Tales perhaps had no more careful copyist than the scribe of Hg, yet the manuscript contains a total of 876 variants, unique and by acco (including the Parson's Tale ). Even attributing half of these to his exemplar (an unlikely percentage) leaves a remainder of 438, almost an error a page. Because the exemplars of El were at times demonstrably farther from the original scribe copy of Chaucer's holograph (O) than the exemplars of Hg (e.g., the Summoner's Tale after line 1991), a larger proportion of the El variants by acco must stem from problems with its exemplars. This still leaves the Hg scribe the more careful in proofing, but not in copying by the 14-to-8 ratio of the total number of variants by acco . On the other hand, the 5-to-1 ratio of unique variants is unassailable and implies very different scribal habits. In the first place, a unique variant is almost always attributable to the scribe of the manuscript (in the case of the large number and many affiliations of the manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales ). There may be cases where the unique variants stem from earlier scribal mistakes in manuscripts which served as exemplars only for a single copy or where other scribes recognized errors and corrected, but for early manuscripts of good textual affiliation, the great majority of unique variants are the scribe's own. Some or all of these unique variants may be unintentional, depending upon the scribe's attitude toward the text: in this regard, Manly and Rickert attribute only 5 of Hg's 47 unique variants to editing, whereas they attribute 89 of El's 249 to this cause. While such a comparison does not quite demonstrate Hg's "entire freedom from editorial variants" (though the 5 so termed are at least arguable), the El scribe's greater willingness to edit his text is clear from these figures alone. As there are four tales in the El analyses where Manly and Rickert make no statement about editing, the count could probably be even higher. By their nature, unique variants should also shed some light on the proofing of a manuscript. Variants by acco are mostly mistakes common to scribes as a profession (rather than stemming from the common ancestor of a manuscript tradition). That they were also mistakes which are easy to over-look in proofing is shown by their continuance and number. Unique variants, on the other hand, are mistakes peculiar to one copying of the text; a careful proofing should catch a number of them. In line with his greater care in copying is the Hg scribe's greater care in proofing: despite the greater number of variants in El, Manly and Rickert list twenty times when the Hg scribe corrected a variant (twelve of them unique variants) to only four times when the El scribe corrected (all four unique variants). The Hg scribe's greater care in proofing and correcting is shown clearly by a final set of numbers: taking the 12 corrected unique variants from the total of 47 leaves 35 unique variants in Hg; taking the 4 corrected from El's 249 leaves 245 (a ratio of uncorrected variants of 7-to-1 ). A look at the two manuscripts themselves shows why this difference in proofing cannot stem from the conditions under which each was produced. If either copyist was rushed in his work, it must have been the Hg scribe: the inexpensive vellum used, the lack of supervision, and especially the blank spaces for words and even lines all suggest that he may have been under some time-constraints. El, on the other hand, is the most elaborate manuscript of the Canterbury Tales : copied on expensive vellum, provided with the famous illuminations, this manuscript was prepared with care and at great expense. So it is not the press of time but a difference in attitude toward the received text which is the operative element in the substantive differences between the texts of Hg and El. A look at the Friar's Tale where, as we have seen, the Hg and El scribes are copying from the same or a very similar exemplar will show specifically how the difference in attitude toward the text of the exemplar is revealed by the kinds of unique variants in each manuscript. Hg and El each has in its text of the tale three unique variants, meaning that no other manuscript has them of the eighty-four extant. But the reasons for the variants in each manuscript are quite different. The first two Hg variants occur in line 1282, where the line in the Manly-Rickert reconstruction reads, "I praye that noon of yow be yuel apayd." It may be that the exemplar had a brevigraph for 'yuel' (evil) which the Hg scribe mistook, or it may be that mental fatigue caused him to write 'y payd' instead of 'yuel apayd'. Whatever the explanation, it must fall into Manly and Rickert's category of "unintentional errors" rather than "editorial variants." The other unique reading in Hg is in line 1571, and this is one which the scribe caught and corrected (an example of his greater care in proofing). Manly and Rickert say of El's three unique variants, on the contrary, that they are "all probably editorial" rather than unintentional (II, 226). A look at the three variants in their contexts will show both why Manly and Rickert call them "editorial" and why they seem to point to the scribe himself rather than to a separate editor or supervisor. The first unique reading in El occurs at line 1479 and is given in brackets: I wol entende to wynnyng if I may And nat entende oure [hir] wittes to declare. The second unique reading is in line 1496: And som tyme be we suffred for to seeke Vpon a man and do his soule vnreste And nat his body [soule] and al is for the beste. The third unique reading occurs in line 1502: And som tyme be we seruant vnto man As to the erchebisshop [Bisshop] seint Dunstan. Remembering that these variants were certainly not in the El scribe's exemplar, the first point to be made is that two of the changes cannot be the result of misreading. The closest of the three to such a possibility is the second, which may be an "eye-skip" from the line before. As for the possibility that an editor other than the scribe was responsible for the changes, the very misunderstanding of, in all three cases, a very limited context speaks against this (as do other variants by acco , to be discussed below). The first passage is the expression of that favorite Chaucerian villain's ideal of keeping mum and looking out for Number One (all the time blabbing to someone). Very little thought would have been needed by an editor to show why, whatever the momentary confusion of the switch from the singular I of the preceding line to the plural oure , greater confusion results from changing oure to hir (their). Similarly, someone (Manly and Rickert's "intelligent person") who was familiar with the idea of a fiend's being allowed to afflict the body but not the soul might have changed body to soule in line 1496; however, if he had been looking at only so large a part of the context as three lines, he would have seen that the soule in the preceding line had to be changed to body for the lines to make any sense. On the other hand, if we are to see in the variant not intentional change but an unintentional "eye-skip," then a signal instance of faulty proofing is evident. The third change, in line 1502, of erchebisshop to Bisshop looks like the attempt of someone to correct what he thought was a factual error; however, the change turns the line into one of four beats, also a questionable change for anyone with the time to read it over. (The possible attention of the El scribe elsewhere to meter will be discussed below.) In lines 1735-44 of the Summoner's Tale (where Hg and El are still closely affiliated), the Summoner is describing how the friar goes around begging while his companion writes down the names of the givers; then he switches at line 1746 to mimicking the friar as he begs (El variant in brackets): Ascaunces that he wolde for hem preye Yif us [hym] a busshel whete or reye A goddes kechyl or a tryp of chese Or ellis what yow list we may nat chese Apart from the fact that El's hym is a unique variant, the we in line 1748 underlines the switch to indirect quotation and shows how another El editorial change has neglected a very limited context. Quite simply, the he of line 1745 seems to have led to the hym of line 1746, while the we of line 1748 was not noticed. Two unique variants in the Clerk's Tale (where Hg and El are also affiliated) show hasty editorial decisions for other reasons (lines 341-342 and 425-426, respectively): But shortly forth this mater [tale] for to chace Thise arn the wordes that the markys sayde * * * And for he saugh that under lowe [heigh] degree Was ofte vertu hid . . . . Once again, these changes are understandable, but once again they show the same misunderstandings of context found in many of the tales in El. In line 341 the scribe remembers that a tale is in progress but does not remember (realize?) that it still has two-thirds of its length (to line 1212) to go. That a marquis is doing the seeing apparently caused him to change the lowe to heigh in line 425, but little thought would have been needed to reject the change, both because the virtue of the lowly Griselda is the focus and even more because the change violates the point of the immediate context and of the tale as a whole. These variants are unique to El, they are obviously editorial rather than unintentional, and they violate very immediate contexts. Numerous other unique variants in Manly and Rickert's "Corpus of Variants" (Volumes V-VIII) amply demonstrate why they labelled such changes "questionable" and "some distinctly for the worse, even involving misunderstanding of the context" (II, 150). Other editorial changes, on the other hand, and even some of those listed above also demonstrate why Manly and Rickert describe the one who made the changes as "an intelligent person." An intelligent scribe who is copying line by line and occasionally deciding in the midst of copying a line to change the reading of his exemplar seems a far more likely candidate for the role of editor in these circumstances than some such person as an intelligent supervisor who is reading over the whole text and deciding which of its readings should be changed. The number and kind of El's variants by acco give perhaps stronger support yet to this identification of the El scribe as the editor. More than a third of the unique variants in El are probably due to intentional change, whereas the great majority of the variants by acco are the result of failures of care; nevertheless, both causes operate in both kinds of variant (a point neglected, for the most part, in the Manly-Rickert analyses in Volume II where, most of the time, only unique variants are analyzed for editing). As noted, the ratio of variants by acco in El comes close to the Manly-Rickert estimate of "approximately twice" the number of such variants in Hg. Not only the larger number but the parallel with what was going on in the copying of other manuscripts make these variants by acco in El an even stronger basis for identifying the El scribe as the source of editorial variants: most of the variants by acco in those other manuscripts, after all, had their sources in both scribal accidents and scribal intentions. In the Friar's Tale , besides its three unique variants and the fifteen which it shares with El (and which thus stem from the exemplar), Hg has three other variants; by contrast El, besides its own three unique variants and the fifteen shared ones, has eighteen other variants, three shared with affiliated manuscripts (but also probably by acco , given the shared exemplar of Hg and El and the general accuracy of the Hg copying). The other fifteen variants are shared by acco with other manuscripts. Unlike variants shared with affiliated manuscripts, variants by acco are traceable to errors and to decisions to edit which are common to the copying process itself; therefore, these are the kinds of variants we need not hesitate to call errors. When such errors by acco are added to those seven times as many uncorrected unique variants in El, the difference in its textual quality relative to Hg is seen to be greater still. Of the other tales where Hg and El are affiliated, in the Summoner's Tale (to line 1991), Hg has no unique variants and has 5 by acco , while El has 4 unique variants (2 labelled "editorial") and 7 by acco . In the Clerk's Tale (apart from 9 variants shared with El), Hg has 4 unique variants, 4 others labelled "editorial" (of the total of 5 so labelled), and 19 others by acco with other manuscripts; El, conversely, has 22 unique variants (6 editorial) and 39 others by acco . In the Monk's Tale , apart from 14 variants shared with El, Hg has no unique variants and only 15 by acco ; El has 41 other variants, 8 of them unique (of which 3 are called "editorial"). In the Nun's Priest's Tale , Hg and El share 10 variants; in addition, Hg has "11 trivial variants," of which none is unique, while El has 11 unique variants and 36 others. Finally, in the Manciple's Tale , "Hg has ten variants not in El, one unique," and "El has 14 variants not in Hg, four unique" (II, 453). The list need not be extended to tales where the two manuscripts are not affiliated: in some of those the ratio is much larger, as in the unaffiliated portion of the Summoner's Tale after 1991 where Hg has 9 variants, none unique, while El has 15 unique variants and "more than 60 others" (II, 240). Rather than use space to demonstrate how El's editorial variants by acco are like the unique variants at times in showing the same kinds of misunder-standings of limited contexts, the examples of variants by acco which follow will be used to make another point: many are very trivial pieces of editing indeed. In the Clerk's Tale , for example, the affiliated Hg records the received reading "knaue child" in lines 444, 447, and 612; El erased the knaue (boy) each time and replaced it with man . In the Nun's Priest's Tale , line 4084, Chauntecleer begins to relate his dream: "By god me mette [dreamed] I was in swich meschief . . . ." El changed mette to thoughte . In her reply Pertelote explains that all such dreams about red come from a superfluity of "rede cholera," as when people (or chickens) dream "of rede bestes that wol hem byte" (line 4121). Apparently because of the word byte , El changed the reading rede bestes to grete bestes . In line 4132 Pertelote begins her prescription for her husband, "Now sire quod she whan we fle fro the bemes . . . ." For we El substituted ye . And finally, when the dastardly fox has nabbed our hero, the Nun's Priest picks out the shriek of Pertelote from those of the other six wives (line 4552): "But souereynly dame Pertelote shrighte." For souereynly (in this context 'most loudly') El substituted sodeynly (suddenly). In the Manciple's Tale , line 105, El changed erthe to worlde . Such a list could be expanded, but it makes another point about editorial changes made by El: many of the variants in El are by acco with unaffiliated manuscripts because they reflect the kinds of changes which contemporary scribes made in manuscripts when they thought a word might be misleading or unfamiliar to their readers ( knaue to man , mette to thoughte ), when they thought they had caught an error in their exemplar ( we to ye , rede to grete ), or when they simply were not sure about the word which they found ( souereynly to sodeynly ). Of course, a separate editor might have decided on such editoral changes down to the most trivial (e.g., the numerous changes of preposition, such as to to in , Clerk's Tale , 941; of article, such as a to the , Nun's Priest's Tale , 4072; or of verb, such as gan to began , Nun's Priest's Tale , 4068); nevertheless, the fact that such variants and many more of them are in acco with unaffiliated manuscripts where the scribes are the undoubted sources plus the fact that so many of them are too trivial to tempt an intelligent editor provide added evidence for the case that the scribe is the source of much of the editing in El. A last piece of evidence for ascribing at least the majority of the editorial changes in El to the scribe is the almost total lack of signs that the scribe was supervised by someone else: "A few marginal crosses mark errors; a few corrections are written in the margin, and there are also a few over erasures" (I, 148). Hg has no such signs at all: "Alterations of the text, including the filling-in of words and lines in spaces left by the scribe, were made by several hands, some much later, and perhaps none by a supervisor" (I, 269). Still, Manly and Rickert are probably right that El "must have been carefully supervised," given its expense and elaborateness. As they state elsewhere, "there were originally many more marks of supervision [in the Canterbury Tales manuscripts generally] than have survived" (I, 24). That many of the editorial changes in El were directed by such supervision, however, is much less likely for the simple reason that the overwhelming majority of such changes have no corresponding supervisorial mark. This study has focussed so far on the substantive variants in Hg and El in tales where they are affiliated because there can be no question that the numbers and kinds of unique variants and variants by acco are attributable to the writing-process itself rather than to the lost exemplars. More indicative of the changes made in El, however, are the 15 unique variants and more than 60 others by acco in the half of the Summoner's Tale after the scribe lost the use of the Hg exemplar (for whatever reason). This is because the exemplars away from Hg were so often of a diminished quality which was apparent to the scribe himself: he used two different exemplars after line 1991 in his search for a good one. Manly and Rickert comment: "It looks as if the excellent MS used by Hg-El had become inaccessible to the El scribe at some point between 1991 and 2015 and he had turned to the copy used by d * 1 [one version of the augmented d group] and Gg-Si Ad 3 Ch Ra 3 -Tc 1 -Gl, and when this gave out at 2158, used V cd * 2 [the ancestor of the c and another version of the augmented d groups]" (II, 241). Given the expense of the El project, inaccessibility seems less of a possibility than loss of leaves for the change after 1991. After the change to other exemplars, El changed the text of each far more freely than he had done in the first half. In addition to the parallels with other scribal changes and the variation in variants according to the nature of the exemplar is El's lack of editorial marks. While it may be true that manuscripts which were closely supervised have lost many marks of that supervision, they still have enough marks left to be able to discern the closeness of that supervision: two supervisors can be discerned on Corpus Christi 198 (Cp), as can the places where the scribe failed to make the directed changes; even the eccentric Harley 7334 (Ha 4 ) shows "many signs of supervision" (I, 220). Usually, directions by a supervisor would be marked on the page itself (by stylus, crayon, chalk, or even pen and ink); if they had been given separately (perhaps on sheets of paper or, less likely, on the rare and treasured manuscript being copied), there still should be places where the scribe failed to make the directed change and which would have been marked by the supervisor in his proofing for correction. On the contrary the unsupervised Hg scribe, as we have seen, caught a much greater percentage of his errors than were caught of El's greater number. The lack of supervisorial marks plus the scantness of the proofing and correcting make very close supervision of the text , as opposed to the physical layout of the manuscript, very unlikely. Once again, the evidence points to the scribe as the source of the editing, or at least a great portion of it. One last matter relating to the chart demonstrates how shadowy at times the boundary between accidental and substantive variants can be: Variant #10 (O/-e) and "the question of final e ." For almost a hundred years, Chaucer scholars have debated whether Chaucer's meter is or is not iambic pentameter. Those who believe that it is pronounce the final e in appropriate places and, if they are editors, put in the final e enough times to make for a ten-syllable line (though 'headless' nine-syllable lines are increasingly accepted). In a series of articles and books after World War II, J. G. Southworth pointed out, in the course of attacking the prevailing metrical theory, that a great many of the final e 's in modern texts of Chaucer's poetry had been introduced by editors with no supporting evidence from the manuscripts. 8 Believers in the "final e theory" themselves, Manly and Rickert commented upon the "unusual care" with which El treated this matter of putting in final e. Certainly the ratio of 1129 times when the El scribe spelled with a final e and the Hg scribe did not to 341 times when the reverse occurred shows that El had a more consistent tendency to spell with final e ; however, this study should have raised doubts about this registration's inevitably stemming from the exemplars which the El scribe copied. While such final e 's (and their lack) may be explainable as stemming from the El exemplars, the shifting of such exemplars, the lack of corresponding evidence in contemporary manuscripts, and especially the contrasting lack of such final e 's in the text of the more careful Hg scribe raise serious doubts that this is evidence of anything more than one scribe's habitual spelling. When the Hg and El scribes are copying the Friar's Tale from the same or a very similar exemplar, their registration of no final e in Hg to one in El is 17, the reverse 6; a similar ratio holds when they go on to the Summoner's Tale up to line 1991 (16/2), and it is close when El switches at line 1992 first to one exemplar and then to another (14/11). In the Reeve's Tale , where the scribes are copying from exemplars no closer to each other than the original scribal copy (O), the ratio holds (28/9). These differences may stem from the El scribe's copying final e 's from his exemplars when the Hg scribe fails to, but this study casts doubt on such a conclusion. The Hg scribe tries to be faithful to his exemplar and leaves blanks when he is in doubt; the El scribe is less careful in copying and in proofing, and he is much more willing to make regular changes in his text. Whether he makes the changes in final e 's for the same reason that modern editors do can hardly be recaptured, but that they are his changes and not a faithful registration of his exemplars seems very likely. Here, then, is the evidence that different scribes with different habits and different views of their roles produced Hg and El. The likeness between their hands indicates either that one trained as the apprentice of the other or that both trained as apprentices of a third (the old-fashioned nature of the hand perhaps suggests the latter). On the other hand, the two scribes had different habits with such accidentals as spelling thow or thou , using &amp; or spelling out and , using the brevigraph for -er- , and so forth. Of greater importance for the text of the Canterbury Tales , the El scribe had a different understanding of his role with the substantives of his exemplars: rather than leave space for a word or a line to be filled in later, as the Hg scribe did, the El scribe at times changed unfamiliar words for familiar ones, reversed less usual orders of words (e.g., is he to he is ), and corrected what struck him as mistakes in his exemplar. In addition to the intentional changes which the El scribe made, the greater number of variants than Hg throughout, both unique and by acco , and especially those where the two manuscripts are affiliated textually show that he was also less careful in copying and in proofing his copy. These differences in scribal habits between the scribes of Hg and El are more important than for the manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales in any other combination because both have texts of much higher quality than any other extant manuscript (Cambridge Gg.4.27 is probably in third place) and because of the role which El continues to play in editorial decisions. Manly and Rickert's acknowledgement of the much higher quality of the texts of the two manuscripts is shown by the way they devote part of each analysis of the variants and of the manuscript-relations of a tale to a comparison of the characteristics of Hg and El—whether they are affiliated or not. Their awareness of the very large role played by El in the half-century preceding their own edition (when a lightly emended El was virtually unanimous) prompted their warning that because of the evidence of systematic editing in El, "the unsupported readings of this MS must be scrutinized with the greatest care" (I, 150). Although their warning was applied only to unique variants, the present study has shown that it should be extended to the many more variants which El shares with other manuscripts by accidental coincidence ( acco ). The fact that an El variant can be found in other manuscripts for which there is no possibility of a common ancestor simply means that similar intentional and unintentional changes were common among fifteenth-century scribes: such changes produced not only the unique variants in El but also the variants by acco . The availability of the First Fascicle of the Variorum Chaucer provides a convenient means of testing the statistics presented in this study. Such a testing will be welcome for refining the totals but is unlikely to threaten conclusions based on a great number of accidentals, large percentages of variation, and a regularity largely unaffected by the textual affiliations of the two manuscripts. While the identification of the scribe as the source of the editing in El does not rest on such numerical bases as does the differentiation of the Hg and El scribes, this also may be tested by a search of Manly and Rickert's analyses in Volume II and their "Corpus of Variants" in Volumes V-VIII. A general return to the study of Manly and Rickert's monumental edition can only help the current understanding of the text of the Canterbury Tales . Such a return will certainly reinforce two of the most significant discoveries of the Manly-Rickert project: the very high quality of the text of the Hengwrt manuscript and the many dangers of too great a reliance on and trust in the text of the Ellesmere manuscript.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Lost MS of Chaucer's Legend of Good Women? by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Gentleman's Magazine for June 1758 (pp. 261-262) printed a letter from Paul Gems a ge (a misprint for Gems e ge), the anagramatic signature of the antiquary Samuel Pegge, a regular contributor to the periodical. His subject in the June 1758 letter was the sleep of plants, a subject prompted by a pamphlet by Linnaeus on the phenomenon of plants closing up for the night, and he quoted the pertinent lines from The Legend of Good Women . There lovith no wight hartyer alyve, And whan that it is evyn I rynne belyve, As sone as the sone ginneth to west, To see this floure, how it woll go to rest , For fere of night, so hatith the darkenes, Her chere is plainly spread in brightnesse Of the sonne for then it will unclose: (ll. 59-65) Pegge proceeded by stating, "I have a MS. of this part of the author, from whence, to spare the trouble of reporting various readings, I have transcribed the above passage literatim . Those who are curious may compare it . . . with the printed copies of Chaucer , since there are some variations which I think preferrable to what at present are read in Mr. Urry ." Having occasion to inquire into the etymology of "daisy," Pegge quoted again from his MS: The longe daie I shope me to abide For nothing ells, and I shall nat lie, But for to looke upon the daisie, That well by reson men it call maie The dayes ye, or els the ye of the daie. (ll. 80-84) And then once more: And fro me farre came walking in the mede The God of love, and on his hande a quene, And she was clad in a roiall habite grene, A fret of golde she had next her here, And upon that a white crowne she bere With floures small, and I shall not lie, For all the world right as a daisie I crounid is, with white levis lite, So were the the floures of her crowne white, And of perle fyne and oryentall Her white crowne was markidall, For the which the white crowne above the grene, Made her like a daisie for to sene, Considderith eke her fret of gold above. (ll. 212-25) He notes that Urry has "considered" in the last of the quoted lines and thinks it "certainly better." Examination of the manuscript texts of the Legend of Good Women in the Chaucer Society Supplementary-Texts of Chaucer's Minor Poems , Series I, No. 22 (1871, reprinted 1888) raises some interesting questions. First of all, Pegge's MS is most closely related to BM Add MS 9832, with the first two quotations agreeing verbatim but not literatim with that MS. However, in l. 214, where the BM MS has "habytt of grene," Pegge's MS has "habite grene," a reading found in six other MSS. The BM MS has "markyd all" where Pegge's MS has "markidall" (l. 222), a unique reading. And, finally, Pegge's MS shares the reading "to sene" (l. 224) with seven other MSS., while the BM MS has "to seme." Two possibilities exist. Pegge may have made errors in transcription, despite his statement that his transcriptions were literatim, or he possessed another, hitherto unknown MS of Chaucer's poems. The unique reading in l. 222, "markidall," makes sense, if possibly not preferable to the "makyd all" of the other MSS. Pegge's library was sold on March 29, 1798 but no MS of The Legend of Good Women is listed in the sale catalogue. A note on the BM MS reads, "This is apparently the first portion of the MS. acquired by Urry from Mr. Morell Thurston of Rochester, and collated by him. See his edition of Chaucer's Works, 1771 [643, n. 1]." The MS was acquired in June 1835 from the bookseller Thomas Thorpe. Despite Pegge's MS being closer to the BM MS than to any other MS of the poem, it would seem to have been another, but now lost, version.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">It is still rare for the setting-copy used by an early printer to be positively identified. 1 Consequently, any evidence which can be gathered from the study of such texts is of considerable value, since visible signs left on the text and the textual changes accompanying the transition into print provide an insight into the practices of compositors and print-shop editors during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. This is the principal area of interest in the present article, where the research described explores a connection between the printed fragments of the 'B' version of the romance of Ipomydon printed by Wynkyn de Worde and the unique manuscript copy of the poem in B.L. MS Harley 2252. Harley 2252 (hereafter referred to as H) is a commonplace book compiled in the early years of the sixteenth century by a London citizen and mercer, John Colyns. Two romances, Ipomydon 'B' and the stanzaic Morte Arthur , are, apart from personal memoranda made by a later owner of the MS, the only items not to have been written out by Colyns himself, or under his direction. 2 They were copied during the fifteenth century, possibly between 1460 and 1480. 3 Comprising seventy-nine folios out of a total of one hundred and sixty-six, they clearly dominate his 'boke'. It is a reasonable assumption that he obtained them together, and that they originated in the same scriptorium, since the scribe who copied all but one side of a folio of Ipomydon also wrote out the first sixteen folios of the Morte . 4 In addition, the first folio of Ipomydon and the last folio of the Morte are extremely dirty, indicating that the two romances jointly were left in an unbound condition for a not inconsiderable length of time. Fragments of two printed editions of Ipomydon survive; one leaf is to be found in the collection of Bagford Ballads (C.40.m.9) in the British Library, of which it forms item 18, and there is a substantial fragment of thirty-eight leaves in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, now catalogued as P.M. MS 20896. (S.T.C. 5732.5). These two printed editions will from hereon be referred to as BL and PM respectively. BL has had the excess paper around the text itself cut away, leaving a page measurement of approximately 141 mm. x 84 mm., and it has been inserted, through careful cutting and glueing, into the lower half of a larger sheet. 5 No watermark is visible, as is to be expected in a fragment of quarto. Underneath, in an eighteenth-century hand is inscribed "From the romance of 'Ipomydon' pr. by W. de Worde". The fragment is equivalent to ll. 261-320 in H, but there is a disruption in sense between the bottom of the recto of BL and the top of the verso, and a check against H suggests that four lines (289-292 in H) are missing. That the top of BL has been lost is confirmed by the presence of descenders which are just visible above the present first line of the recto. PM is complete but for the first signature, and corresponds to lines 193-2346 in H. Although the dates suggested for the printing of BL and PM have varied in the past, in the revised S.T.C. BL is now assigned to c.1522, and PM to c.1530-31. That the two fragments are from different editions is certain. Although the types used appear to be the same, a change of compositor is suggested by variations both in word division and in spelling. For example, the reading of before in BL (l. 263, see below) is changed to vnto in PM, while the latter reverts to the MS reading of saluted in l. 303, as opposed to salewed in BL. Terminal 'e' is omitted from several words in PM, which might possibly reflect the later date of this edition. PM, as a later edition, may well have been set up from BL; de Worde's use of a previous printed edition as copy has been established in one case at least, 6 and an important point to bear in mind where Ipomydon is concerned is that the original manuscript may not have been available at a later date, a point which will be explored further. In the present discussion, therefore, attention will be focused on BL, not only because of its primacy, but also because of its shortness which, in the context of this article, enables a fairly exhaustive survey of the evidence and its implications to be carried out. Where relevant, support will be drawn from the longer, New York version. The possibility of there being a close affiliation between BL and H was initially suggested by a note in J. Burke Severs' Manual of Writings in Middle English to the effect that BL corresponds "roughly" to ff. 57b-58a in H. 7 This claim proves to be an underestimation, for there are strong indications in H that it constituted the copy for de Worde's BL edition. The similarity between the two versions is striking, as can be seen below. The uncertainty of readings on the verso of BL is accounted for by bad staining; the line references are to Kölbing's edition of the poem. 8 Harley 2252 f.57v BL (Bagford Ballads) the lady comaunded sone Anone The lady commaunded anone soone þat the gates were vndone That the gates were vndone And bryng theym all by fore me And brynge them all before me ffor wele at ese shall they bee For well at ease shall they be They toke hyr pages hors &amp; alle They toke theyr pages horse and all þ e se two men went into þe halle These two men went into the hall Ipomydon on knees hym sette Ipomydon on knees hym set And the lady feyre he grette And the lady fayre he gret I am A man of strange contre I am a man of straunge countre And pray you yff youre wille to be And praye you yf it your wyll be That I myght dwelle w i t h you to yere That I myght dwell with you this yere Of your norture for to lere Of your nurture for to lere I am come from ferre lond I am come out of ferre lande ffor speche I here by fore the hand For I herde tell before hande That your norture And your servise Of your nurture and your seruyse Ys holden of so grete empryse Is holden of so grete empryse I pray you þ a t I may dwelle here I praye you that I may dwell here Some of your s er vyse for to here Some of your seruyce for to lere The lady by held Ipomydon The lady behelde Ipomydan hym semed wele a gentilman And semed well a gentyll man She knew non suche in hyr londe She knewe non suche in all her lande So godly a man &amp; wele farand So goodly a man and well farande She saw also by his norture She sawe also by his nurture he was A man of grete valure He was a man of grete valure She cast full sone in hyr thought She cast full soone in her thought That for no s er vyse come he noght That for no seruyse came he nought But it was worship hyr vnto But it was worship her vnto In feyre s er vyse hym to do In her seruyse hym to do f.58r She sayd syr welcome ye be . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Leaving aside, temporarily, the precise nature of the changes between BL and H, confirmation of a connection can be gained from the manuscript itself. Making allowance for the missing lines at the top of BL, and working from the assumption that there were thirty-two lines to a page (which can be confirmed from PM), a check on f. 58r of the manuscript reveals that opposite what was undoubtedly the last line of the recto of BL is a scratched loop, faintly coloured, possibly by pencil, or perhaps by an accumulation of dirt. 9 On f. 57v, thirty-two lines back, there appears a further coloured scratch mark, plus a sign which could possibly be a numeral. Then, working forwards in the manuscript from what would have constituted the first line of the verso of BL on f. 58r, after thirty-two lines there appears to be no mark of any description; however after another sixty-four lines, on f. 59r, there is a definite loop, followed by a further faint stroke opposite the next thirty-second line. In other words, H contains a sequence of line-markings which, although disrupted, are appropriate to the setting-up of a printed text, and these line-divisions were indeed used in PM. Only one seeming mistake was made in this sequence in H, as noted in the analysis, below. The text of Ipomydon begins on f. 54r of H and a scratched horizontal line can be found opposite line 32 of the poem; marks continue at thirty-two line intervals down to a first break, as observed, on f. 58r. These marks are confined principally to a horizontal line scratched onto the paper with a drypoint or stylus. Occasionally ink is used. In addition to these lines other marks can be found, some of which may be numerals. These are much faded and some difficulty is experienced in attempting to interpret them, as will be seen. An interesting piece of additional evidence which suggests that the manuscript was actually present in the printshop at some time is the occurrence of smudges throughout the text which could well be printer's ink; on f. 54v there is a definite ink stroke above a blurred mark, which could have been made at the same time, while on f. 71r there is a mark which looks very like a finger-print; a further possible finger-print, though less clear, is on f. 55v. The series of smudges along the outer margins of many of the recto leaves could be the marks left by someone turning over the pages in the shop. All these impressions are in the same, greyish-black, presumably printer's ink. This slight evidence of wear is a phenomenon often associated with a text having been in a printshop, and the point can be illustrated by reference to some of de Worde's other copy. 10 The collation of BL can be hypothetically reconstructed on the basis of the signatures in PM; this would suggest that the format for both printed editions could have been the unconventional one, for this period, of quarto in fours. As already noted, PM is complete but for the first signature; a comparison with BL shows that the latter possibly formed Bii recto and verso (minus four lines at the head of each side). Working forwards in H up to the point where signature B begins in PM, it is evident that signature A would have consisted of three leaves or six pages; a more likely explanation is that the gathering is a full one of two double leaves and that the first leaf formed a title page, thus giving a final collation to the book of A-H 4 I 6 ; the total number of pages would then have been seventy-six. The numbers of the first three leaves of signatures A-H in PM were printed simultaneously with the text; Iii and Iiv have been added in a modern hand, as have I5 and I6, and this latter numeration confirms that the last gathering is in fact a ternion rather than two double leaves and one single. A mistake was made in the original type-setting whereby Hiii and Hiv were printed instead of Biii and Biv, but the book has been put together correctly. The note on the inside cover of the volume as it is now bound, where Ipomydon follows "the mylner of Abyngton", is thus incorrect in stating that leaves 3 and 4 of sheet I are misplaced. 11 The following analysis takes into account all those marks observed in H which seem to bear some relation to the preparation of the text for its transference to the printing-press. They can, as already noted, be divided into two categories. Firstly, horizontal lines or loops found in the margins at intervals coincident with the page-division adopted in the printed editions, and secondly, marks appearing either in conjunction with these, or by themselves, at similar points of division. These latter marks can be seen as either alphabetical letters or numerals. Out of the total of seventy-four pages which can be assumed to have constituted the whole of BL, only twenty are not determined in one or other of these ways in H. The likely interpretation of all these marks is that they were made by a compositor as he cast off his copy prior to setting it in print. 12 Although it is by no means a proven rule, it is thought that it was customary at this stage to set up an edition by formes rather than seriatim. 13 This system had the advantage that less type would be required at any one time, but necessitated the casting off of each page of copy in order that the signatures could be correctly composed. In the following tabulation, the conjectural working page number used in the printshop (see note 20) is listed; this is followed in brackets by the line reference to Kölbing's edition of the text and the relevant MS folio number. In all, forty-one pages as they would have appeared in the printed edition are cast off with either the line or loop; these are: A3 to A8 (32,64,96,128,160,192;54r-56r); B2 (256;57v); B7 (416;59v); C1 (484;60v); C6 (640;62v); C8 to D6 (704,736,768,800,832,864,896; 63v-66r); E1 to E3 (992,1024,1056;67v-68r); E5 (1120;69r); E7 to F2 (1184,1216,1248, 1280;69v-71r); F4 (1344-71v); F6 to G2 (1408,1440,1472,1504,1536;72r-74r); G4 (1600;75r); G8 (1728;76v); H2 to H3 (1792,1824;77r-77v); H6 to I1 (1920,1952,1984,2016;78v-80r); I4 to I5 (2112,2144;81r-81v). The following fourteen of these pages are accompanied by additional marks or scratches, varying from simple diagonal or vertical strokes to complex, though indistinct, groups of marks: A6, A7, A8, B2, B7, C8, D2, D3, D6, E1, E3, E5, F6, I5. These more complex marks are found by themselves in a further thirteen instances: B1 (224;57r); B3 (288;57v); B5 (352;58v); B6 (384;59r); B8 (448;60r); C2 (512;61r); C5 (608;62r); C7 (672;63r); D8 (960;67r); G5 (1632;75r); G7 (1696;76r); I7 (2208;82v); I8 (2240;82v). It will be seen that marks occur less frequently in the second half of the MS; this might perhaps indicate that the compositor gained in confidence as he worked near the end of the text and was able to judge where page divisions should come without having to mark them. The single column lay-out, following that of the MS, would have been helpful in this respect. Alternatively, the lower frequency of notation might be explained, when taken in conjunction with some of the other evidence presented by H, by more than one compositor having been involved in the work. Apart from the gaps in the sequence of strokes and the overall scarcity of additional signs in the latter part of the MS, there seems, around f. 69, to be a distinct change in the way in which page division is marked. Up until this point the divisions are usually scratched in; they extend from the margin into the column of text under the first word of the line; they are always made boldly and are occasionally in a form which can best be described as that of an extended caret sign lying horizontally, its lower limb longer than its upper, with its apex pointing away from the text. After f. 69 the line markings tend to be restricted to a faint stroke underneath the first letter of the first word of the line (sometimes it also appears under the last letter of the last word, e.g. f. 71r, or solely in this position, as on ff. 73r,74r), and often seems to bear traces of ink. It is significant that the change seems to occur at this point in the manuscript, for f. 69 is the last leaf of a quire, the romance being composed of two equal gatherings, ff. 54-69 and ff. 70-85. 14 On the basis of this natural division in H it is possible to make a more precise statement about the frequency with which marks occur. Out of the thirty-seven pages in each half, thirty-one pages in the first and twenty-three in the second appear to have been cast-off. The cumulative nature of the evidence might therefore suggest that two compositors had worked on the text and, whilst it is not possible to prove conclusively that this was the case, 15 it remains an interesting possibility. In the matter of casting-off and setting-up the type, the compositor(s) who worked on H had a relatively simple task to accomplish when compared with those who worked on other MSS now established as printer's copy. This is partly due to the fact that Ipomydon is in verse rather than prose and consequently the problem of estimating the number of words which would fit onto any given page does not arise. 16 The absence of chapters or headings within the poem eliminates any requirement for justification on aesthetic grounds. Further, the poem is in couplet form rather than stanzas, so again the compositors did not encounter the problems of lay-out with which Richard Pynson's workmen had to deal in the edition of The Fall of Princes . In this work an attempt to simulate the lay-out of the manuscript page was abandoned when it was found that this entailed the division of a stanza at the end of a page. 17 By comparison, therefore, the apportioning of lines of text to each page was a fairly straightforward operation in H, and only one mistake was made in the casting-off. This occurred at the end of f. 60v (C1), where thirty-six lines were counted instead of thirty-two. This was immediately rectified, however, with the next page-division coming after twenty-eight lines (f. 61v, C2). The function of the groups of marks which appear in addition to the line or loop is more difficult to assess. From the evidence furnished from other contemporary copy, it seems that it was a fairly common practice to divide a text into signatures and mark these either with sequential alphabetical notation 18 or with a recurring 'signum', 19 within the divisions of which the page rather than the leaf number was noted, i.e., A3 instead of Aiir, etc. 20 Whilst such detail is not always found, some MSS being marked only with dashes or crosses, 21 the remnants of more elaborate signs in the margins of H would lead us to expect some correlation of these with the signatures as they finally appeared in the printed editions. Within the marks which do occur, there seem to be two groups which are worthy of note. The first of these is found on ff. 55v-56v. The least vague sign in this group is that on f. 56v (at l. 192), which could be the roman numeral 'viij'; the number of strokes is not clear, but there are three dots above the mark. Working backwards from this it may be possible to see the marks on ff. 55v and 56r, corresponding with pages A6 and A7 (ll. 128,160) in the printed edition, as 'vj' and 'vij' respectively. This interpretation works well, so long as it is assumed that the compositor wrote the number of the page he was casting-off at the bottom, rather than the top, of the appropriate section of text. A drawback to this understanding of the facts arises, however, if the page number was meant to refer to the portion of text immediately following it; assuming the text to have begun on Aii recto, the sequence would then be one number out. In other words, the mark after page A7 should be 'viij' and that after A6 'vij' and so on. If the latter suggestion as to working methods in the printshop is the correct one, the apparent discrepancy could be explained by an error on the part of the compositor who was calculating the apportionment of text on the basis of its beginning on Ai verso rather than Aii recto, but this must remain hypothetical. The other group of some interest is that spread over ff. 63r-67r. Here, on f. 65r (at l. 1800) is found one of the clearest marks in the MS. Throughout this portion of H a curved 't' form is found, which could be interpreted as the letter 'C' (it certainly fits in with contemporary representations of the letter). Whilst the identification of this recurring mark remains conjectural, there is no doubt of the marks which follow it on f. 65r being the roman numeral 'iiij'. However, the apparent recurrence of this assumed letter 'C' into what appears as signature D in the printed edition is an anomaly in such a scheme, although the numerals which come after it, 'iiij' on f. 65r and 'vij' on f. 66r would correctly number the succeeding pages of the signature. There could be another explanation. If the original edition, BL, was to be set up as a quarto in ternions, rather than in fours, signature C would extend from f. 63v to 68v, and the numbers 'iiij' and 'vij' would still be in the appropriate places if this was the method followed. 22 It is possible that either this was the one adopted, and BL was issued in ternions with a collation of A-F 12 G 4 , or that a change of policy was decided upon and BL issued, as PM later, as a quarto in fours. There is now no means of knowing for certain, and it should be stressed that any of these interpretations can only be tentative because of the faintness of the markings. On the assumption that H was the printer's copy for BL, analysis of the variant readings may help to deduce the printer's and/or compositor's attitude to the poem. Amongst the modifications made by the compositor in BL in order to bring the spelling into conformity with his own practices was an element of updating. For instance, 'th' is consistently substituted for the 'þ' of the manuscript, as is single 'f' for double 'f'. The substitution of 'out of' for 'frome' in l. 273 may be due to a change in pronunciation; if the 'e' on 'ferre' was now silent the addition of an extra word would have served to maintain the metre. It is possible that dialectal changes also lay behind the reversal of 'sone' and 'anone' in l. 261, but the whole issue at this late date is a difficult one to resolve. Further attempts to improve the metre can be seen in ll. 301 and 303 with, in the first case one word omitted, and in the second one word added, in order to make their respective couplets flow more smoothly. In l. 279 the compositor has even gone so far as to change the spelling, and hence pronunciation, of the hero's name to achieve a perfect rhyme. These are not the only places where there seems to have been a deliberate attempt to alter manuscript readings in an effort to produce greater consistency and intelligibility in the text; a similar motive may lie behind the changes in the following lines (readings from H taken first): l. 270 And pray you yff youre wille to be / And praye you yf it your wyll be l. 271 That I myght dwelle with you to yere/ That I myght dwell with you this yere l. 274 ffor speche I here by fore the hand/ For I herde tell before hande l. 288 In feyre s er vyse hym to do/ In her seruyse hym to do l. 294 And at youre wyll for to here / And at y(our) wyll for to lere l. 311 And sayd he was lytell syre/ And sayd he was no lytell syre And attempts to create a more uniform metre can again be seen in: l. 281 She knew non suche in hy r londe/ She knewe none suche in all her lande l. 313 Whan they had et e A nd grace sayd/ Whan they had ete n and grace sayd Lines 274-277 show how the approach could be extended to make better sense of a fairly long passage, simply by changing one phrase, and by adding one word (modern punctuation indicates the modification of meaning): H BL I am come from ferre lond, I am come out of ferre lande ffor speche I here by fore the hand For I herde tell befor e h and That your norture And your servise Of your nurture; and your seruyse Ys holden of so grete empryse Is holden of so grete empryse I pray you þ a t I may dwelle here . . . I praye you that I may dwell here . . . Although this process of making the poem more intelligible is found throughout, at the same time an apparently contrary attempt is being made to achieve a degree of archaisation. This is seen in the spelling of certain words (the retention of final 'e' on 'anone soone" l. 261 and 'soone anone' l. 305, and in the addition of a final 'e' to many words as in, for instance 'brynge' l. 263, 'wente' l. 266, 'praye' l. 270, 'farande' l. 282, etc.) 23 and in some substitutions: the replacing of 'here' by 'lere' in ll. 278 and 294 might come into this category, as would 'araye' for 'atyre' in l. 308. Such a practice would not be inconsistent with the contemporary vogue for reading and publishing romance, since it could be argued that by the beginning of the sixteenth century, such works had become essentially archaic, far removed from the milieu in which they had originally been composed. In support of this idea there is evidence that texts were not only being adapted in this manner, but also that some were even written at this time in a consciously 'archaic' fashion, in which both style and theme echoed older traditions. 24 Suggestions of careful editing or 'tidying-up' of the text can in fact be found in the manuscript itself, before the transition into print. It might again be supposed that this was part of a deliberate policy on the part of the printers to produce a more polished version. At several places in H there are corrections, made in a different ink and a different hand to those of the original scribe. The copyist of Ipomydon used an ink which has faded to varying shades of brown, whereas the corrector's ink has remained a decisive black. The corrections and interpolations are as follows: f. 54r 'eke' inserted between '&amp;' and 'of lesse' (l. 37) f. 54v 'kynge' inserted before 'Ermones' (l. 43) f. 54v 'hawkis' changed to 'haukis' (l. 61) f. 55r 'theyr' substituted for 'hyr' (l. 93) (Cf. l. 265 in the extracts) f. 57r 'no' inserted between 'ne' and 'man telle'; also on the following line 'where' replaces 'what' and 'go' replaces 'be', thus producing lines which read: ne no man telle what I am Where I shall go ne Whens I cam (ll. 233-234) f. 61v 'fayre &amp; well' substituted for 'I wille telle', thus eliminating the exact repetition of the rhyme from the line above (l. 550): Off the Eyre of Calabre here will I telle And of hyr baronage fayre &amp; well f. 62v 'had' substituted for 'herd' after 'tythingis' (l. 683) f. 63r 'theyr' substituted for 'here'; also 'ley' crossed out, 'pourvay' inserted (l. 664) f. 64r 'hym' inserted between 'mette' and 'in' (l. 729) f. 64v 'ptere' expanded to 'portire' (l. 779) f. 65v 'here' marked underneath with a dotted line, 'now' written in above (l. 838) f. 66r 'hyr' replaced by 'theyr' (l. 889) f. 68v 'rede' replaces 'ryght' to qualify 'knyght', and 'here' substituted for 'there' (ll. 1102, 1105) f. 70v 'to' inserted between 'huntynge' and 'goone' (l. 1244) f. 70v 'wild bestis' underlined, 'many a beast' inserted (l. 1253) Several of these changes illustrate the point that the corrector made more sense of the text than did the scribe whose work he was revising. The amendment of f. 68v is a particularly good example, since the passage is dealing with Ipomydon's exploits in his guise of the Black Knight, fighting a Red Knight, whom the Lady of Calabria takes to be Ipomydon in his previous day's attire; 'ryght knyght' in this context is, to say the least, ambiguous, whilst 'rede knyght' clearly distinguishes the identities of the two combatants. The correction on f. 70v improves both the rhyme and the metre: For he hathe take many a beast The grettest that was in the foreste It seems unlikely that these revisions were made by a supervisor in a scriptorium at the time of the original copying of the romance because elsewhere in the manuscript the scribe has carried out his own corrections. 25 Perhaps the most probable explanation is that the revisions are the work of an editor in the printshop. 26 Whilst none of these revisions appear on the folios of H corresponding to BL, examination of PM confirms the fact of editorial intervention. Of the nineteen corrections which are found in H, fourteen are incorporated here without any change apart from minor variations in spelling similar to those already noted (ll. 233-34; 550; 638; 664; 729; 779; 889; 1105; 1253-54). Of the others, the interpolations in lines 37, 43 and 61 cannot be checked due to the loss of the first printed signature, while the remainder can be accounted for by assuming alteration by the compositor in order to improve the text still further. This would certainly seem to have been the case when the lines are compared in some detail (MS readings taken first, with initial 'editorial' corrections indicated by italics): f. 65v; ll. 837-838 Diiir praying hym as lord dere Prayeynge hym as his lorde dere Come home now to thyne owne manere Come home to thyne owne manere f. 68v; l. 1102 Eiiir the rede knyght full sone she see Full soone the reed knyght dyde she spye The first line can be seen to have been regularised in length to improve the metre, while in the second example the rhyme word has been changed from 'see' to 'spye' to accord with 'on hye' which ends the preceding line; word order has also been modernised, and the line lengthened, again to improve the metre. These discernible stages of what may well be called editorial revision do suggest that the manuscript was initially scrutinised and briefly corrected, and that the compositor was then left to effect further changes as he went along. This could be an indication of another way in which the techniques adopted by the early printers resembled those of scribal copyists. The manner in which the text was treated in composition both reinforces previous conclusions as to the freedom with which they approached their task 27 and reveals contemporary attitudes to the genre of romance. Having studied the physical evidence regarding the transition of Ipomydon from manuscript to printed edition, it is interesting to consider the possible reasons which prompted its publication. As has become clear, the MS was handled with considerable care, and not marked more than necessary. Other MS copy which received equally discreet treatment is known to have been loaned to printshops 28 and it is therefore appropriate at this point to look at the role which the owner of Harley 2252, John Colyns, may have played in the decision to publish the work. It is known that Colyns was in possession of the two romances which formed the basis of his collection five years before the conjectural date of de Worde's first edition. The evidence for this is his inscription under the Explicit to the Morte on f. 133v, which runs as follows: "Thys Boke belongythe to John Colyns m ercer of london dwellyng in the parysshe of our lady of wolchyrche hawe Anexid the Stock es in þe pultre yn Anno domini 1517". Colyns was therefore in a position to have lent the text to de Worde. In support of this it seems probable that Ipomydon was in the print-shop without its accompanying romance, since the last gathering of Ipomydon (ff. 70-85) is a complete one of sixteen leaves, and the first one of the Morte is similarly complete. Further, the Morte is in a far cleaner condition than Ipomydon , showing no corresponding signs of wear. Since, as has already been observed, the two romances were apparently not separated before Colyns' purchase of them, it seems probable that he was responsible for loaning only the relevant portion of the MS to de Worde. 29 From this evidence it may be justifiable to assume that Colyns instigated the publication of Ipomydon in the same way as his fellow mercer, Roger Thorney, had done in the case of de Worde's editions of Trevisa's De Proprietatibus Rerum and the Polychronicon (Bone, op.cit. ). It is unfortunate in this respect that no colophon survives from BL, for of course Thorney's patronage of de Worde was established from this source. An envoy to Ipomydon , written by Robert Copland, is found in PM, but its usefulness in clarifying Colyns' involvement is limited. 30 Copland's participation in de Worde's publishing enterprises is well documented; the two men continued to work together, and Copland published under de Worde's sign, even after he set up his own press at the sign of the Rose Garland in Fleet Street in 1515. 31 The suggestion has been made that it was Copland who may have initiated the publication of many romances by de Worde's printshop 32 and while this might be a reasonable assumption to make as regards the second edition of Ipomydon , no such certainty exists about the original decision to publish it. It is possible that Colyns' approach to publishing may have taken place through Copland's agency rather than through that of de Worde himself, but there is no firm proof either way. It does seem, however, that Colyns' participation in the venture could have extended in more than one direction. Evidence survives which suggests that, in addition to supplying the text, he was also in a position to have undertaken to sell the finished product. Colyns was admitted to the Mercers' Company in 1492 33 but a document exists which implies that by 1520 his trading interests were concentrated on activities not normally associated with the Mercers. At an assembly of the Company held on September 26th of that year, he apparently requested permission to engage an apprentice on the same terms as those held by the "Vestment makers", by payment of an entry fee for him of 6s 8d. This was duly granted by the members present, on the grounds that ". . . the said John Colleyns doth nor occupieth no feat of Secrettes of the mercery but in Sellyng of Prynted bokes and other small tryfylles . . .". 34 The implications of Colyns' interests as reflected in this record are of some consequence both in assessing his own literary preferences, with regard to the rest of the contents of his 'boke', and in providing more indications as to the organization of the printing and bookselling trades at this time. Whilst an investigation of these areas is beyond the scope of the present article, 35 there remain more immediate conclusions to be drawn. Firstly, the fact of Colyns' patronage goes at least part of the way towards explaining de Worde's publishing policy as regards romance. 36 Secondly, while the edition of Ipomydon can scarcely be said to have the same cachet as some of the other books produced under the widely-based tradition of mercantile patronage, 37 the connection of this work with Colyns provides a valuable insight into literary taste at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Romances were popular publications in the early years of printing 38 and while those issued by Caxton, mainly in prose, were directed largely towards the tastes of the nobility, 39 the printing of a comparatively unsophisticated work such as Ipomydon gives some idea of the reading matter of the middle classes at this slightly later date. 40</field>

Examples of Richard Pynson's setting-copy, for Lydgate's Fall of Princes and Dives and Pauper , are analysed by Margery Morgan in the Bulletin of the John Rylands Library , 33 (1950-51), 194-196 and The Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 217-228. Some of William Thynne's copy for his 1532 edition of Chaucer is discussed by James E. Blodgett in The Library , 6th ser., 1 (1979), 97-113. H. C. Schulz, after publishing his discovery of a "Manuscript Printer's Copy for a lost Early English Book" in The Library , 4th ser., 12 (1942), 138-144 established that the copy was in fact used as the basis for Robert Wyer's edition of the Book of Purgatorye ; see Huntingdon Library Quarterly , 29 (1965), 325-336. Gavin Bone, op.cit. , pp. 304-306, suggested that The Court of Love found in Trinity College Cambridge MS R.3.19, owned by John Stow, was used by the printers for Stow's 1561 edition of Chaucer. Work on later sixteenth-century copy has been carried out by John Bromwich in "The First book Printed in Anglo-Saxon Types", Transactions of the Cambridge Society , 3 (1962), 265-292 and by Sir Walter Greg, who found Richard Field's copy for his edition of Harington's translation of Orlando Furioso (1591); see The Library , 4th ser. (1924), 102-118. Dr Percy Simpson's work on the copy for the 5th Book of Hooker's Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie (1597) in "Proof-Reading by English Authors of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries", Oxford Bibliographical Society's Proceedings Papers ii, 1 (1928), 5-24 has been considerably developed by W. Speed Hill in Studies in Bibliography , 33 (1980), 144-161. For a general survey see Percy Simpson: Proof-Reading in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (1935, repr. 1970). Considerable work has been done on continental printers' copy and much of this is relevant to the study of English compositorial habits. Early copy used by Netherlandish printers is discussed by Wytze Gs Hellinga in Copy and Print in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, 1962) and this is dealt with in greater detail by Lotte Hellinga-Querido in Methode En Praktijk Bij Het Zetten van Boeken in de Vijftiende Eeuw (Amsterdam, 1974, thesis), where the main centre of interest is the relation between Jacob Bellaert's edition of the Historie van Jason (Haarlem 1485) and its British Library copy. See also "Notes on the order of setting a fifteenth century book" by the same author, in Quaerendo , 4 (1974), 64-69, and "Problems about technique and methods in a fifteenth century printing house" in Villes d'imprimerie et moulins a papier du XIVe au XVIe siecle . Colloque International . Collection Histoire Pro Civitate serie in-80 no. 43 (Brussels, 1976), pp. 301-312. The printing of Pontanus' De prudentia by Mayr in Naples (?1508) is dealt with by W. H. Bond in Studies in Bibliography , 8 (1956), 147-156, and further bibliography on Italian printers' copy is found in de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. , note 79. Bertram Colgrave and Irvine Masson discussed the first edition of Bede's Prose Life of St Cuthbert (Basle, 1563) in The Library , 4th ser., 19 (1939), 289-303. 2 A full analysis of the hands involved in the copying of items in the MS, together with a descriptive catalogue of its contents will be found in a thesis by the present author, currently under preparation for presentation to the University of York. 3 The evidence from the watermarks of the paper used, though not in itself conclusive, when taken into account with the two copyists' hands, datable in broad terms to the second half of the fifteenth century, would seem to indicate a date around the middle of the second half of the fifteenth century. I should like to thank Dr David Smith of the Borthwick Institute for Historical Research, York, for his assistance in dealing with the palaeographical aspects of the texts. 4 Folio 83v is in a different hand, but there is nothing to associate it with a date later than that of the main copyist. This is contrary to the opinion expressed by Valerie Stewart Roberts in An Edition of the Middle English Romance: The Lyfe of Ipomydon (University of Michigan Ph.D thesis, 1974), p. vii, where she states that the hand is early sixteenth century, and "probably that of Colyns himself". The forms of many of the letters are so different as to preclude such an identification. 5 The fact that there is another excerpt from a romance inserted into the top half of the page has been responsible for the erroneous statement that three leaves of Ipomydon were preserved in the British Library (see e.g., H. S. Bennett: English Books and Readers 1475-1557 [Cambridge, 1952], p. 254). The mistake apparently originated with the compiler of the Index to the Bagford Ballads, where item 18 is described thus; the mistake has since been corrected by a later cataloguer and the two leaves on the upper portion of the page assigned to a Charlemagne romance. 6 It has been proved that Wynkyn de Worde used the 1486 edition of the Book of Hawking, Hunting and Blasing off Arms by the Schoolmaster Printer, now in the British Library, for his edition of 1496. See the discussion by George D. Painter under "Notable Acquisitions of Printed Books 1961-62: Incunabula" in The British Museum Quarterly , 27 (1963-64), 100-101. An extended examination of the relationship between the two texts will be in the forthcoming volume BMC XI. 7 Vol. I (1967), 154. 8 Eugen Kölbing: Ipomedon in drei englischen Bearbeitung (Breslau, 1889). 9 Both Bone and Mitchener refer to 'pencil' being used to mark MSS ( op.cit. , pp. 306 and 8, respectively), whilst Schulz suggests a plummet and red crayon; "Manuscript Printer's Copy for a lost Early Book", p. 141. An interesting reference in this connection can be found in the roughly contemporary Garland of Laurell by John Skelton (pub. 1523), where there is a passage describing writing instruments: castyng my syght the chambre aboute, To se how duly ich thyng in ordre was, Towarde the dore, as he were comyng oute, I sawe maister Newton sit with his compas, His plummet, his pensell, his spectacles of glas, Dyvysynge in pycture, by his industrious wit, Of my laurell the proces every whitte. (ll. 1093-99) I am indebted to Professor V. J. Scattergood of Trinity College, Dublin, for bringing this to my attention; he suggests that Newton, though unidentified, might have been a scrivener or illustrator who worked for the Howard family, patrons of Skelton. Apart from this, the earliest recorded usages of 'pencil' and 'plummet' in the O.E.D. as marking instruments in the modern sense are from the seventeenth century. The light greyish-black colour of some of the markings in H could be accounted for either by an accumulation of dirt (admittedly selective), or by the use of one of these instruments. 10 Cf. Mitchener's discussion of the smudges in the Plimpton MS of De Proprietatibus Rerum ( op.cit. , p. 9), also Plate VIIa, of the MS of the Expositio Symboli , in de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. Lotte Hellinga, in her article with Hilton Kelliher, "The Malory Manuscript", in The British Library Journal , 3 (1977), 92-94 has established that this MS was in Caxton's workshop through an analysis of such marks under infra-red light, some of which proved to be off-sets of type. 11 I am indebted to Professor Derek Pearsall of the University of York for his help in looking at PM in situ; additional information has been gained through examination of a microfilm of the text. 12 For various theories as to the function of compositors' marks see Wytze Gs Hellinga: Copy and Print , pp. 95-98 and Harry Carter in the 'Foreword to the Reprint' of Percy Simpson's book, op.cit. , p. viii. More recently Lotte Hellinga has confirmed, through her detailed work on the copy for Bellaert's edition of the Historie van Jason that at least some of the marks found in the B.L. text were indicative of casting-off. See Methode en Praktijk , Summary in English, p. x, and "Notes on the order of setting a fifteenth century book". Following the results of her work on this text she was able to establish similar practices in the two early Netherlandish prints by Ketelaer and de Leempt, previously described by W. Gs Hellinga; see "Problems about techniques and methods" pp. 304-305, 308. 13 Lotte Hellinga makes the point that although the printer's copy so far examined does conform to these findings, each case must be judged independently; see de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. , p. 198. 14 Ipomydon ends on f. 84r; f. 85 was originally left blank but Colyns later copied various poems and short prose pieces onto it. 15 One way of checking to see whether two compositors had worked on the text would be to compare differences in spelling and vocabulary between H and the assumed halves of the printed edition; but sufficient text to make this a feasible proposition only survives in PM, and, as already noted, the compositor(s) here have effected further changes from BL. 16 For illustration of the different ways in which compositors belonging to various printing houses tackled this problem see Mitchener, op.cit. , pp. 15-17, Margery Morgan, "Pynson's MS of Dives and Pauper ", pp. 219-220 and L. Hellinga, "Notes on the order of setting a fifteenth century book", pp. 65-66; also de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. , pp. 198-200. 17 See Morgan, "Pynson's MS of Dives and Pauper ", p. 218, note 3, and "A Specimen of Early Printer's Copy", pp. 195-196. 18 As in the Rylands MS of the Fall of Princes , see Morgan, "A Specimen of Early Printer's Copy", p. 194. 19 For de Worde's use of this system in the MS of De Proprietatibus Rerum see Mitchener, op.cit. , p. 9; it is also found in Hervagius' copy for Bede's Life of St Cuthbert , see Colgrave and Masson, op.cit. , p. 299. 20 This seems to have been the common form of printers' numeration; the wide geographical and chronological span of its adoption in printing houses is commented upon by Bone op.cit. , p. 306 and Colgrave and Masson op.cit. , p. 298. 21 See de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. , p. 198; cf. W. Gs Hellinga, op.cit. , Plate 13, which shows that at least part of Ketelaer and de Leempt's 1473 edition of Aquinas' Tractatus de divinis moribus is marked only in this way. A similar system of marking is found in the MS of The Court of Love used by Stow in his 1561 edition of Chaucer; see Bone, op.cit. , pp. 304-306. 22 If this was the scheme adopted, it would mean that the mark on f. 63r, which is admittedly extremely vague, could no longer be read as a 'C' (it could perhaps be a cross), and that the two marks towards the end of the text on f. 82v, which can be seen as the letter 'I,' should instead be viewed simply as vertical strokes. If it had been planned to set up BL in ternions these pages would have formed part of signatures B and F respectively. 23 Even this practice was not adopted throughout; for example in l.17 final 'e' is removed from 'dwell' but added to 'praye'. Differences between BL and PM on this point have been noted, above. 24 See, for instance, the discussion of the Court of Love by R. H. Robbins in Vol. 2 of A Manual of Writings in Middle English , ed. A. Hartung (1973), pp. 1087-89. 25 On ff. 58r, 63r and 74v he inserted words which he had accidentally omitted; on ff. 59r, 70v, 75v and 80r he placed dots under words wrongly copied, supplying the correct word either above or in the margin. On f. 95r of the Morte Arthur he made a more serious mistake, misplacing two whole couplets; here also he indicated his error, presumably a deviation from the text in front of him. 26 A "number of tiny, very neat marginal corrections" are similarly found in the Rylands MS of the Fall of Princes according to Margery Morgan; see "A Specimen of Early Printer's Copy", p. 195. 27 Cf. the comments by H. C. Schulz in "A Middle English Manuscript Used as Printer's Copy", p. 327. 28 Cf. the care which Caxton took of Traversagni's autograph MS, Ruysschaert, op.cit. , and the clean condition of the St John's College MS of the Siege of Thebes and the Plimpton MS of De Proprietatibus Rerum as seen in the plates in Bone, op.cit. , Simpson, op.cit. , frontispiece, and Mitchener, op.cit. , See also de la Mare and Hellinga, op.cit. , p. 201 and plate VIIa, for the Sloane MS of Rufinus' Expositio Symboli . For an exception to this rule, see plate 38 in Blake, England's First Publisher , a folio of the Harley MS of The Orcherd of Syon , and the discussion of the probable reasons for the comparative carelessness with which it was treated, on pp. 90-92. 29 It is interesting to speculate as to the reasons why no edition of the Morte was published; part of the explanation could perhaps lie in the fact that this romance was one of the major sources used by Malory in the final books of his Morte d'Arthur ; this had been published by Caxton in 1485 and further editions were issued by de Worde in 1498 and 1529. To this extent perhaps a potential market had already been captured. 30 The verses run as follows: 'Lenvoye of Robert C. the prynter' O lytell Jest / vndepured of speche Vnto thy reders I alway me excuse Go take thy mater I hertly the beseche Though þu rudely / no other termes vse This is thy copy thou can it not refuse Syth þt no wryter / wolde take þe to amende In this my labour / I myght it not entende finis Enprynted at London in the Flete-strete / at the sygne of the Sonne by Wynkyn de Worde 31 Only about twelve books printed solely by Copland survive from the period up to 1535. See, amongst others, H. R. Plomer: A Short History of English Printing (1912), pp. 47-50. 32 For the most recent theory concerning de Worde's publishing rationale see the articles by N. F. Blake: "Wynkyn de Worde: The Early Years" and "Wynkyn de Worde: The Later Years" in Gutenberg Jahrbuch , 1971 and 1972, respectively. For a discussion of Copland's role, see "The Early Years", p. 66. 33 I am indebted to Jean M. Imray, Archivist to the Mercers' Company, for her kindness in supplying me with this, and other, details from the Register of the Freemen of the Mercers' Company compiled by the Company's Clerk in 1528. 34 See Acts of Court of the Mercers' Company , edited with Introduction by L. Lyell assisted by F.D. Watney (1936), p. 509. 35 They are dealt with in greater detail in the thesis by the present author, above mentioned. 36 It also qualifies the comment made by Blake that Roger Thorney "was the only merchant to patronise Wynkyn" in "Wynkyn de Worde: The Early Years", p. 67. 37 For details of the patronage of such merchants as Hugh Bryce, William Bretton and Roger Thorney see E.

      <field name="heading_text">Harington's Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops : An Additional Manuscript by R. H. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Attesting further to my earlier conclusion that Sir John Harington's A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops, to the yeare 1608 was circulated more broadly in manuscript than had previously been realized, is the discovery of another manuscript of that work, which should be put in the company of the manuscripts that have already been identified. 1 Trinity College Dublin MS. 806, ff. 141-175, contains a partial text of the Supplie , from its beginning through the first paragraph of the account of Archbishop Edwin Sandys (pp. 33-161 of my edition). 2 It is titled erroneously "A Supplie or Addition to the Catalogue of Bishopps to the yeare 1618." The manuscript volume itself constitutes a collection of over forty miscellaneous items having to do with English and Irish affairs in the first half of the seventeenth century, in various hands. Contents are listed in the Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin , comp. T. K. Abbott (1900), pp. 133-135. According to the Library's records the manuscript was originally in the library of John Madden, M.D. 3 Madden's manuscript volumes came to the Library in a bequest from John Sterne, bishop of Clogher, in 1741 ( Catalogue , pp. iii-iv, xv). The manuscript is in a transitional hand of the early seventeenth century. Both the hand and the original owner remain to be identified. The first page of the manuscript, f. 141r, was used as a practice sheet by the scribe and is covered with many passages of legal phraseology and with two passages from the Supplie . In two places on the page is the statement "Iohn Saunders is the trew owner of this Book," in an italic hand different from that of the manuscript, laid over the original writing. Other names appearing on the page underlying the original scribal practisings are the names "Valentine Hawley" and "Christo: Blounte gent.", the latter appearing twice. Sir Christopher Blount, marshal of the army in Ireland under the Earl of Essex, was executed in 1601, six years before the Supplie was written. Harington had served in Ireland under Essex, as a captain of horse. The manuscript is very badly stained along its inner margins, making the process of transcription and collation difficult. Two folios have deteriorated almost completely (143-144). Collation of this text establishes it to be related textually to B.L. Harl. MS 1220, ff. 134-248 (siglum H ) and B.L. Sloane MS. 1675 (siglum S ), but most closely to H . It is descended from the exemplar of H , since it varies sufficiently from H not to have served as its exemplar or to have descended from it. In the stemma produced in my earlier article, p. 158, it should be shown as a member of the H-S group. Since the hand is not Harington's and since it is not closely related textually to the fair-copy manuscript tradition of B.L. Royal MS 17 B xxii, it has little textual value, other than to indicate once again that the Supplie circulated in manuscript fairly widely before its posthumous publication in 1653.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Two Shakespeare Quartos: Richard III (1597) AND 1 Henry IV (1598) by MacD. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two compositors originally identified as responsible for setting the Shakespeare First Folio have, with more intensive scrutiny of the volume, split and multiplied into at least nine men, whose stints have proved difficult to determine. 1 It seems likely that earlier bibliographical findings about some of the Shakespearian Quartos may also need revision in the light of evidence derived from new techniques of analysis. In this article I report on an examination of two Quartos—the "doubtful" Richard III (1597) and the "good" 1 Henry IV (1598)—which originated, in part, from the same printing house: 1 Henry IV was printed by Peter Short, as were sheets H-M of Richard III . No full investigation of the composition and printing of Richard III has hitherto been recorded, though Alan E. Craven has dealt in separate articles with aspects of the two sections into which the Quarto falls. 2 Craven can be proved wrong in claiming that Short's portion of Q1 Richard III was set by one man. And my work on 1 Henry IV corrects Charlton Hinman's conclusion, endorsed by Craven, that a single compositor set that particular Quarto. 3 In each case there are modest implications for editorial handling of the text. The 1597 Quarto of Richard III was the first edition of the play. Five more Quartos followed, each printed from its immediate predecessor (except for Q5, which was printed from a combination of Q3 and Q4 copy), before the play's inclusion in the First Folio of 1623. The relationship between the Q and F texts, which differ in numerous substantive readings, and the relationship of each to Shakespeare's autograph, are still in dispute. There is general agreement that the manuscript behind the F text is one of considerable authority, possibly autograph, and since the publication of D. L. Patrick's The Textual History of "Richard III" in 1936 the orthodox view has been that Q gives an inferior text, being based on a report of an abridged acting version of the play, that the manuscript which served as copy for Q was, in other words, reconstructed from memory by a common effort of the acting company, perhaps in order to replace a missing prompt-book while the actors were on tour in the provinces. This theory has been challenged by Kristian Smidt, who asserts that Q is largely a good text which, though showing some signs of memorial contamination, also derives in part from an authoritative manuscript closely related to the foul papers. 4 E. A. J. Honigmann has also offered evidence that Q is in some respects closer to the foul papers than F. 5 The exact nature of the copy for F is also in doubt. It seems certain that F is in some way dependent upon Q3, at least for two sizeable passages, but dispute persists over whether it was printed from annotated Q3 copy throughout, from an interleaved mixture (corrected with reference to a manuscript) of Q3, Q6, and perhaps other Quartos, or directly from a manuscript which was itself a transcript conflating an authoritative source with one or more Quarto editions. 6 Bibliographical analysis of the First Quarto can scarcely hope to solve all these problems, but it does contribute a modicum of relevant information. As Greg pointed out in his introduction to the Clarendon Press facsimile (1959), Richard III (1597) was obviously divided between two printing houses, sheets A-G being printed by Valentine Simmes, named as printer on the title page, sheets H-M, "in a slightly different type," having come from the press of Peter Short (p. v). The difference in type will be apparent to anyone who studies the capitals in speech prefixes and stage directions. For example, a small roman 'G', instead of italic, is frequent in the first part but does not appear in the second, whereas a tailed italic capital 'G' is used sporadically in the second part but not in the first. Italic capital ' Q ' in the first part is noticeably different from italic capital ' Q ' in the second part (compare, for instance, B3v, which has two forms, with H3v). Then too, an italic capital ' T ' first appears mixed in with the roman on H1v (ten lines from the bottom) and occurs occasionally thenceforth. Italic capital ' I ' is also mixed in with the roman in sheets H-M (appearing at least once on two out of every three pages), but not in sheets A-G. The roman capitals generally (take 'T' and 'Y', for example) are larger in A-G than in H-M. Among lower-case letters 'g' is always useful for type identification: in the earlier sheets the lower counter is open; in the later sheets it is closed. The bowl of lower case 'e' is usually inked in within sheets A-G, seldom inked in within sheets H-M. The dot of lower case 'i' falls slightly to the left of the stem in A-G, but directly above it in H-M. Lower case 'k' is narrower in the later sheets. The signatures differ in the two sections: nine stops are used in the signatures of H-M, none in those of A-G, where the numerals are larger and the spacing between letter and numeral is more variable. In A-G nineteen lines are turned up or down; in H-M there are only two such lines. Italic colons are quite common in sheets H-M but not in A-G. More interesting are the several shifts in spelling and other accidentals from sheet G to sheet H. Detailing a few of the more conspicuous will give some idea of the effect of compositorial preference within the printing house upon presentation of the text. Apart from two instances of do on A3, doe is invariable (60 times) in sheets A-G; in sheets H-M do is preferred (20 times) to doe (15). Within A-G O occurs 26 times, Oh 29 times; within H-M O is almost invariable (27 times; Oh once). Been ( e ) is used in A-G (10 times), bene in H-M (6 times). A preference in A-G for heart (28; hart 3) gives place in H-M to a preference for hart (12; heart 4). Within Simmes's section of the play -y endings greatly predominate, whereas -ie endings are far more common thereafter. The abbreviation Lo: for Lord , very common in the early sheets (76 examples) is almost completely absent from the later sheets. 7 Of more significance to an editor is the punctuation. Commas are used appreciably less liberally, colons far more liberally within sheets A-G, so that while there are 4-5 commas to every colon in the early sheets, the ratio in the later sheets is close to 20 to one. Usage in the earlier sheets is much more consistent than later on—and this brings us to the next point. Valentine Simmes's compositors have been studied by W. Craig Ferguson and, more recently, by Alan E. Craven, who asserts that sheets A-G of Richard III Q1 "are clearly the work of a single compositor. Not only were they set from a single type-case, as demonstrated by the evidence of distinctively damaged types, but they also exhibit a uniformity of compositorial practices, especially heavy spelling preferences." 8 He cites, among preferred spellings in A-G, heart, young, tongue, eie, -nes, here, go , and bloud , and attributes these sheets of Richard III to "Compositor A", who, in his judgement, set all of Much Ado (1600), 2 Henry IV (1600), Hamlet (1603)—the Bad Quarto— and most of Richard II (1597), to list only the Shakespearian play Quartos. I can find no good evidence to contradict Craven's claim that one compositor set sheets A-G of Richard III , and the use of a single skeleton throughout Simmes's section of the Quarto is consistent with it. In Peter Short's section, on the other hand, two skeletons were used, one imposing H(i), H(o), K(i), K(o), and M(o), the other imposing I(i), I(o), L(i), L(o), and M(i). This pattern is suggestive of two presses and two compositors, and the text does in fact display conclusive evidence that typesetting was neatly divided between two men. Compositor N (as we shall call him) hardly ever (9 times out of 173) set a space after commas in short lines, whereas Compositor O, though erratic, set a space more often than not (241 times out of 464). 9 The stints are readily separable on this basis alone, as will be evident from Table 1. Table 1: Spaced/unspaced commas in short lines within sheets H-M of Richard III (1597) H I K L M 1 1/5 1/7 1/14 11/17 9/17 1v 0/6 0/13 0/11 11/15 11/12 2 0/5 0/7 0/12 9/20 13/14 2v 0/3 ¼ 0/4 12/9 1/9 3 19/4 9/8 17/9 0/9 1/19 3v 14/11 11/17 17/8 0/4 0/4 4 14/8 17/13 9/17 2/14 4v 14/5 15/6 9/13 1/14 Within each sheet the work was halved, Compositor N setting H1-2v, I1-2v, K1-2v, L3-4v, and M3-3v, Compositor O the other nineteen pages. This division is confirmed by an examination of the spacing of question marks. Compositor N never set a space before the 43 question marks in short lines on his pages; in 30 such instances Compositor O did not set a space, but in 21 instances he did. The figures for colons are similar. Compositor N set a space before only 2 of his 33 colons in short lines; O preceded 22 by a space and omitted the space from 24. It will be noted that Compositor O set commas, regardless of spacing, far more readily than did Compositor N; O is in fact responsible for the increase within Short's section of the play, N's rate remaining close to that found in Simmes's part. There are some differences in spelling between the two men: for example, Compositor N preferred do (16, doe 1) and Catesby (10), Compositor O doe (14, do 4) and Catesbie (6, Catesby 1); O was more careful to capitalize Lord in the appellation my Lord (N: my Lord 19, my lord 17; O: my Lord 18, my lord 2). 10 The treatment of King speech prefixes, which are often unstopped, is variable within the stints of each compositor. 11 We must assume that both compositors were erratic in their treatment of copy which may well have been inconsistent; or perhaps copy had no stops after King prefixes, and the compositors sometimes remembered to add them and sometimes did not, making some slight effort to be consistent over a single page or stretch of text. Compositor O did not stop King in H and I, but thereafter he omitted the stop only 4 times, so that his overall figures are 12 King prefixes unstopped, 41 stopped (I ignore catchwords, and count only plain King , not King Ri ). Compositor N's overall figures are 44 unstopped, 32 stopped. Despite the variability, the difference between N's and O's overall figures is highly significant statistically, with a less than one in 5000 probability of its occurring by chance (Yates's chi-square = 14.37, 1 df, p &lt;0.0002). 12 If we were to decide that I1v, with its 11 unstopped King prefixes, must have been set by a different man from the one who set I1, I2, and I2v, with their 15 stopped King prefixes, then we would logically be driven to postulate (a) a non-spacing compositor who stopped King , (b) a non-spacing compositor who did not stop King , (c) a spacing compositor who stopped King , and (d) a spacing compositor who did not stop King —these four men working on stints that do not even correspond to pages, let alone feasible sequences of pages. I think that we may confidently accept the neat and rational division of labour implied by Table 1. The implications for an editor are not perhaps of very great consequence. Of possible interest is a change in the positioning of entry directions which seems to occur at about the middle of sheet I. 13 All the entry directions which begin new (unnumbered) scenes in sheets H-M (10 in all) are centered. Otherwise from H1 through I2v 9 entries are set to the right and only one (the longish direction for Richard's entry aloft in the company of two bishops on H1v) is centered; yet from I3 through M3 only one entry is set to the right (on K3v) and 24, in addition to those which begin scenes, are centered. Entries are sparse within I3-K4, and the only two centered entries are quite long, so it is not possible to determine the exact point of change, but it appears to be independent of the compositorial stints, since the figures I have cited in evidence of a shift divide up fairly evenly between the two men. The probable inference is that the change in the positioning of entry directions occurred within the manuscript copy for Q. In this matter sheets A-G resemble sheet H, rather than sheets L-M. Within A-G the 15 entries which begin scenes are all centered; otherwise 21 entries are set to the right and only 5 are centered. So it is clear that whoever prepared the manuscript behind Q was fully conscious of scene divisions, and distinguished between entries which head scenes and entries within them. The distinction is preserved with some care until towards the end of the play. Of course most entries which open scenes are long and could not easily be set to the right, even with the abbreviations often resorted to for the other entries, but some entry directions which head scenes are short, and the practice with regard to centering is obviously not governed solely by length. Of the 5 anomalously centered entries in A-G, 4 appear in sheet F (F1, F2, F4, F4v), although 4 other entries in F are set to the right (F3, F3v, F4v twice). Another noteworthy bibliographical feature of the Quarto is the tendency of the variants O or Oh within sheets A-G, where spelling of the exclamation is variable, to cluster beyond chance expectation. This will be clear from Table 2. Table 2: Oh/O spellings in sheets A-G of Richard III (1597) O A2v O C2v O C4v Oh E1v O F2 Oh A3v O C2v O D1 Oh E1v Oh F2v Oh A4v cw O C2v cw O D1 Oh E1v O F4 Oh B1 O C3 Oh D2 Oh E2 O G1 Oh B1 O C3 Oh D2v Oh E2 Oh G1 Oh B1 O C3 Oh D3 Oh E2 Oh G1 Oh B1 O C3 O D3 Oh E3 Oh G2v Oh B1v O C3 Oh D3 O E4v Oh G2v Oh B3v O C3v Oh E1 O F2 O G2v O C1v Oh C4 Oh E1 Oh F2 O G3 O C2 O C4v Oh E1 O F2 O G3 A simple statistical test of significance—a Runs Test for Randomness—reveals that the probability is less than one in a thousand of such clustering occurring purely by chance ( z = 3.3, p &lt;0.001). Now a single compositor faced with random O/Oh variation in his copy, or with one of the two spellings throughout, might conceivably tend to set a series of O spellings, then a series of Oh spellings, and so on, the clustering being due to the influence of each choice upon the succeeding one. But more natural explanations are that either two compositors, with contrasting preferences, were involved, or that Q's variations reflect copy. The contrast between C1v-D1 ( O 14, Oh 1) and D2-E3 ( O 1, Oh 14), for example, is, after all, striking. I have not been able to detect any clear compositorial differences between O and Oh sections of Simmes's part of Q, and the spacing of punctuation marks is consistent throughout, so I would tentatively accept Craven's arguments for a single compositor in Simmes's sheets A-G, and suggest that the O/Oh variation points to possible heterogeneity in the manuscript copy. In the quality of the text they print, however, O and Oh sections of A-G seem much alike. A point of interest is that while the O/Oh variation in Q1, sheets A-G, is preserved almost perfectly within successive Quarto reprints, it does not survive into F. Q3 misprinted Oh who at II.ii.34 as Wh who , and Q5-8 omitted the exclamation. O, O at III.v.21 was misprinted as G, O in Q3, but this obvious error was corrected to O in subsequent Quartos. Otherwise there is complete agreement between Q3 and Q1. Q6 changed Oh to O at II.ii.59, III.iii.9, and III.iii.18, but all its other spellings of the exclamation agree with those of Q1. (All the Quartos are in perfect agreement over the O spellings and single instance of Oh within sheets H-M, as they are in Q1.) Now 12 times F has Ah where the Quartos have O/Oh —8 of the instances are within the section of F corresponding to Q1 sheets A-G; and larger differences in wording between the Quartos and F mean that several times F has O/Oh where the Quartos do not, and vice versa; but altogether F strongly favours O (66 times) in preference to Oh (10 times), and on all 12 occasions upon which the exclamation O/Oh in F does not occur at all at the corresponding point in Q, it is spelt O . To focus on the portion of the play covered by sheets A-G in Q1, only 5 of the 21 Oh spellings in Q1 and Q3, or 4 of the 18 Oh spellings in Q6, where F actually contains the exclamation, also appear in F; 2 of these 5 agreements occur within the first 164 lines of III.i, where F is generally acknowledged to have been printed from Q3. So outside this passage only 3 of Q1's and Q3's 19 Oh spellings (or 2 of Q6's 16), where F contains the exclamation, within the first half of the play, recur in F. The two Oh spellings within III.i.1-164 were set by Folio Compositor A. To break down the other figures by Folio compositors, in B's stints only one of 15 Quarto Oh spellings recurs, and in A's stints, ignoring III.i.1-164, 2 out of 4 Q1 and Q3 Oh spellings (or one out of 2 Q6 Oh spellings) recur. So if B was setting directly from Q copy, he had, by the time he worked on Richard III , developed a strong preference for the O spelling, not evident in his handling of straight reprints of Ado, LLL, MND, MV, 1H4, Tit , and Rom . 14 (Nowhere in the first part of Folio Richard III does B set Oh when the Quartos have O .) But it is time to return to Peter Short's compositors, and to examine 1 Henry IV . The Quarto (Q1) was printed in 1598 from a Quarto, known as Qo, which originated in the same shop, and of which only a fragment survives. The copy for Qo is usually held to have been authorial papers of a tolerably "fair" kind, though the possibility of a non-Shakespearian transcript has also been entertained: the present compositorial analysis will help illuminate the problem. Hinman claims that "both spellings and various typographical peculiarities indicate that the whole of Q1 was set by the same compositor." (Clarendon facsimile, p. ix) Yet, as Peter Davison pointed out in his New Penguin edition (1968) of 1 Henry IV , the skeleton pattern of the Quarto suggests that two compositors set the text, perhaps for two presses (pp. 251-252). The pattern is similar to that of Short's section of Richard III : again we have the combination of a one-skeleton method of printing and the use of different skeletons in alternate sheets: one skeleton was used for both formes of sheets A, C, E, G, and I, and another for both formes of sheets B, D, F, H, and K; on D1v and D2, and on D3v and D4 the recto running-titles appear on the verso pages, and vice versa. 15 Knowing the compositorial division of labour which accompanies this sort of skeleton pattern in Short's part of Richard III , and with some expectation that evidence from the spacing of punctuation will again prove valuable, we can readily distinguish the stints of two compositors. Table 3 records for each page the number of question marks which are and are not preceded by a space when set within short lines. Table 3: Question marks preceded / not preceded by a space in 1 Henry IV (1598). A B C D E F G H I K 1 2/0 0/2 0/12 3/1 0/4 0/1 0/7 0/1 2/2 1v 0/1 0/1 0/9 4/2 0/2 0/3 0/0 0/0 3/3 2 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/2 0/2 0/1 0/0 0/3 0/3 1/1 2v 0/0 0/0 0/3 0/7 1/2 0/0 0/0 0/2 0/0 0/0 3 0/4 3/0 2/1 0/6 0/4 0/0 0/2 2/1 0/0 0/1 3v 0/3 0/4 1/1 1/4 0/4 0/1 4/3 1/1 0/0 1/3 4 0/7 0/4 3/0 3/1 0/2 0/1 4/1 0/0 2/2 0/3 4v 0/2 0/0 0/0 2/0 0/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 The outline of a regular compositorial division by half of a sheet already begins to emerge, and is clarified by differences in the signatures. The non-spacing compositor (Compositor X) regularly used arabic numerals in signatures; the spacing compositor (Compositor Y) mostly used roman numerals: Compositor X Compositor Y A.2 D 1 E 3 H 1 B.i E H.iii K 3 A.3 D 2 F 1 H 2 B.ii F.iii I 3 C.1 D 3 F 2 I 1. B.iii G.1. K 1 C 2 E 2 G 2 I 2. C.iii G.iii. K 2 If, as I shall give further reasons for doing, we attribute B1-B3, B4v, C3-C4v, D3v-E1v, E2v, F3-G1, G3-G4, H3-H4v, and I3-K3v to Compositor Y, and the rest of the text to Compositor X, then Compositor X's refusal to set a space before question marks within short lines was unremitting (there are 107 unspaced question marks within short lines in his stints), whereas Compositor Y inserted a space more often (46 times) than not (36 times): Spaced ? marks Unspaced ? marks Compositor X 0 107 Compositor Y 46 36 The figures for justified lines display a similar pattern: Compositor Y spaced 33 question marks, and failed to space 31; Compositor X spaced 5 and failed to space 22. Compositor X was far more inclined to set a space before a colon in a long line than in a short line; Compositor Y's rate of spacing colons was unaffected by justification: Colons in short lines Colons in long lines spaced unspaced spaced unspaced Compositor X 7 64 26 7 Compositor Y 22 17 38 25 Neither compositor normally inserted a space after a comma within an unjustified line, but Compositor Y, who always spaced question marks, spaced twice as many commas as Compositor X. Poor inking and the use of commas of several different shapes and sizes make the evidence so ambiguous that it is impossible to reach exactly the same totals of spaced and unspaced commas in successive counts, but Compositor Y appears to have spaced some 16 per cent of the commas within short lines in his stints, Compositor X 8 per cent. 16 Exit directions in the Quarto are set to the right. Most are stopped, but some are not. The distribution of stopped and unstopped exit directions is as follows: Stopped Unstopped Compositor X 5 10 Compositor Y 18 1 The difference between X's and Y's stints is highly significant statistically (Yates's chi-square = 11.771, 1 d.f., p &lt;0.001). There is ample spelling evidence to substantiate the proposed allotment of shares, which gives Compositor X 40 pages, Compositor Y 38. Most notably, Compositor Y had a decided preference for -tie endings, Compositor X a no less strong preference for -ty endings. The overall figures for unjustified lines, with additional figures for justified lines in parentheses, are as follows: - tie endings - ty endings Compositor X 1 (4) 30 (9) Compositor Y 41 (16) 2 (4) Compositor Y set -ie and -y endings generally in about equal numbers; Compositor X avoided -ie endings. Figures for -ie endings in unjustified lines, excluding monosyllables, names, 17 first elements in hyphenated compounds, and -sie and -fie endings (where a ligature is involved), are as follows: -ie endings -y endings Compositor X 4 126 Compositor Y 73 82 Compositor Y strongly preferred the modern spelling of shall , whereas Compositor X was scarcely less willing to set shal . The figures for occurrences in unjustified lines are: shall shall Compositor X 31 32 Compositor Y 4 24 The difference between the two men is statistically significant (Yates's chisquare = 8.57, 1 d.f., p &lt;0.005). Compositor X was also much more tolerant than Compositor Y of al and wil . In short lines X set al 10 times and wil 14 times; Y set each spelling 5 times. Thus X's total for shal, wil , and al in unjustified lines is 55; Y's is 14. Two further words over which the compositors display sharply contrasting spelling habits are blood and enough : Compositor X Compositor Y blood 0 9 bloud 10 5 enough 6 1 inough 0 6 Finally, one of the Quarto's "various typographical peculiarities" helps establish that two compositors set the text, and that the proposed division is essentially correct. The presence in the Quarto of the 'oo' ligature has been remarked by Hinman. There are, on my count, 134 instances; but the un-ligatured 'oo' occurs 235 times. If a single compositor set the text, we might expect a random distribution of the alternative forms; if my proposed allotment of compositorial shares is more or less right, it would be somewhat surprising to find each man setting the same proportion of 'oo' ligatures. The actual figures are as follows: Ligature Separate sorts % ligatures Compositor X 48 126 28% Compositor Y 86 109 44% The disparity here may not seem particularly remarkable, but it is statistically significant: there is less than a one in five hundred probability of its having occurred purely by chance (Yates's chi-squire = 10.16, 1 d.f., p &lt;0.005). 18 However, availability of the ligature, as supplies were diminished through composition and replenished through distribution, is another possible factor in the use or non-use of the ligature. Figure 1 presents the incidence of the main compositorial markers in graphical form. There the overall pattern is clear enough—a division of labour by half of a sheet appears to have been the intended norm—but for some pages any ascription must be very tentative. As Figure 1 has three X markers for every two Y markers, the latter must be given compensatory extra weight. On B1v the X markers are shal, wil (3 times), and a single unspaced question mark; these are among the less reliable discriminators—7 of Y's 9 shal and wil spellings in short lines are on his first three pages, B1-B2—and they are outweighed by the Y markers: 2 spaced colons and 2 -tie endings, one in a short line. D3v contains Y's only enough spelling, but if we were to attribute the page to X it would contain the sole spaced question mark in X's stints; the 2 spaced commas, out of 6, also suggest Y. On E2, where the ascription to X produces a break in a sequence of Y's pages, the markers are merely 2 unspaced question marks in short lines on a page with no spaced question marks; this is painfully slight evidence, but there are also 3 unspaced question marks in justified lines, and the spellings bloud and thril slightly suggest X, as does the absence of ligatured 'oo' on a page with 7 unligatured 'oo' forms. On G4v the evidence for X is a single -ty ending. On K2v the character of the 4 X markers does not quite warrant our assigning this page to X when the surrounding pages are by Y: the X markers are merely shal, al (twice), and one unspaced colon; the Y markers are one spaced colon and one stopped exit; this stopped exit would constitute strong evidence of Y were it not anomalously stopped with a colon after an abbreviation ( Exit Ki :). Other uncertain ascriptions are of F3v, H3v, K3, and K3v to Y, and of I2v to X. Some of the contrasting spelling habits of Compositors X and Y, deduced from Q1 as a whole, can be confirmed by examination of those pages for which their Qo copy survives. These Q1 pages are, for Compositor X: C1-C2v; and for Compositor Y: B4v (in part), C3-C4, and a few lines of C4v. Compositor X changed - tie to - ty once, and made 5 other alterations from - ie to - y endings, 3 of them, however, in long lines. Compositor Y changed - y to - ie 3 times; 2 of the changes occur in long lines, but Y's acceptance of 14 - ie endings from his copy, including 2 - tie endings in short lines, and 3 in long lines, sharply distinguishes him from Compositor X. Also significant are Compositor Y's 2 changes of enough to inough . Compositor X had accepted enough on C2v. The treatment by X and Y of - l and - ll spellings of shall, will , and all is more problematical, but if we confine our attention to short lines the evidence is at least consistent with our earlier deductions that X is much more tolerant of the short forms of these monosyllables than is Y: Compositor Y changed shall to shall twice in short lines; Compositor X's only changes in short lines were in the same direction— shal to shall twice, and wil to will twice—but he accepted his copy's shal twice and wil twice in short lines on C1v. The fidelity with with Q1 reproduces the surviving portion of Qo has often been remarked. 19 Only three substantive variants have been noted: whipt replaces whip at I.iii.239, C1 = X, mine owne replaces my owne at II.ii.37, C3v = Y, and fat is omitted from "How the fat rogue roard" at II.ii.118, C4 = Y. The first variant is an obvious and universally accepted correction, the second a plausible "improvement", rejected by the New Arden editor A. H. Humphreys (1960), and the third an error of omission. Compositor X also changed Saine in II.i.70, C2v, to Saint . The OED records Sayn as a 14th-16th century spelling of Saint , and Sayne and Sain as 15th century variants. So X's change can be regarded as a normalization of spelling. One definite error and one unauthoritative correction over a whole sheet is a good record for Short's two compositors: X's work was verbally perfect. Both compositors were unusually faithful to the punctuation of Qo. Much, therefore, depends upon the accuracy with which Qo itself was set. Can we detect the hand of either of Q1's compositors in the Qo fragment? The fact that five of the eight pages are in prose makes judgement difficult, because the evidence is distorted by the requirements of justification. The overall figures for spacing suggest Compositor Y: 7 question marks spaced, 6 not spaced, in short lines; 17% of commas spaced. The 6 -tie spellings (3 in unjustified lines) point in the same direction; there are no -ty spellings. And the roman numerals for signatures form another link with Y's stints in Q1. Moreover the exits (one on C2, one on C3, and 2 on C4v) are all stopped. The compositorial markers graphed in Figure 1, which, for the most part, reveal clear divisions in Q1, suggest that Compositor Y may have set Qo C2-C4v (21 Y markers, 8 X markers), and Compositor X C1-C1v (3 Y markers, 12 X markers). 20 Reading through the section one is struck by the prevalence of - l endings in C1-C1v, and their rarity thereafter, and whereas within C1-C1v shal occurs 6 times, shall not at all, on C2v, also a verse page, one example of shal is followed by 4 of shall . There is one further indication that X may have set C1-C1v and Y C2-C4v. In Q1, until we reach G3, Y's pages, 21 altogether, are consistently free from apostrophes except that B4v has taken over 2 (-' d and - c't ) from Qo, whereas 14 of X's 27 pages contain at least one apostrophe, and the total number of apostrophes is 22—all but one (in ther's on C2v, where it has been taken over from Qo) in past participial -' d or -c't endings. On G3 Y sets one apostrophe, and thenceforth he is indistinguishable from X in his treatment of -' d and -c't endings. No other change in Y's habits occurs at G3, so there is no reason to suspect that from G3 onwards "Y" is really some new workman. Now in Qo, C1 has 2 apostrophes in -c't endings, and C1v 2 in -' d endings. Pages C2-C4v, in contrast, afford only the anomalous ther's on C3. So, in this feature also, pages C1-C1v of Qo match Compositor X's pages in Q1, and pages C2-C4v match Compositor Y's. 21 If X set C1-C1v and Y set C2-C4v, the only real anomalies are the presence of the roman signature on C1, for which I can offer no good explanation, and the 3 enough spellings on C2v, C3v, and C4. Y's preference for inough could well have developed as he set Q1; compositors sometimes accept copy spellings as they set a text for the first time, and harden in their preferences as they work on a reprint. Such a process might adequately explain the change which both compositors made from oy and ay to oi and ai spellings: X made 6 changes of this kind, Y 7, if we include 3 from Poynes to Poines . Y also made one change in the opposite direction, from faith to fayth on C3. Some oy and ay spellings still survive in Q1, though few of them are medial, and on C3v-C4v Compositor Y retained Poynes 7 times, and even expanded the speech prefix Po. to Poynes on C4v (as well as expanding it once to Poin . on the same page). The evidence is not sufficient to enable us definitely to decide whether Compositors X and Y set the surviving fragment of Qo, but on the whole it seems to me more likely than not that they did so. Both formes of sheet C of Qo were evidently printed from a single skeleton, so one may speculate that the printing of Qo followed the same pattern as 1 Henry IV Q1 and the Richard III Quarto—a one skeleton method combining with alternation of two skeletons from sheet to sheet. If Compositors X and Y did share the setting of Qo, as well as of Q1, we have good reason to suppose that Q1, though at two removes from the manuscript copy, is a fairly accurate representation of it. Was this manuscript holograph or a transcript? There is general agreement that copy cannot, in view of the Quarto stage directions, have been a prompt-book, but the formality of the orthography, where colloquialisms and contractions seem better suited to the tone or demanded by the metre, has led several scholars to suppose that "the copy for Qo was rather a scribal transcript of the foul papers than these papers themselves." 22 Of fourteen unelided forms which the New Arden editor lists in illustration of this feature of Q1, 6 appear in X's pages, 8 in Y's; 4 of them derive from sheet C of Qo, where they fall on pages tentatively assigned to Y. 23 As Q1 follows Qo faithfully in these instances, it probably does so in the others. I think we must assume that absence of elisions was a feature of the manuscript underlying Qo, for the evidence which falls short of proving that Compositors X and Y set sheet C of Qo is at least clearly indicative of two workmen, and whether or not they were X and Y, they are unlikely to have shared a partiality for "sedate expansions." 24 One small item of evidence, previously unnoticed, comes close to clinching the case for a non-Shakespearian transcript as copy for Qo. David J. Lake has shown, in The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays (1975), that playwrights had strong individual preferences with regard to variant forms of connectives, such as among and amongst, while and whilst, betwixt and between , preferences which may be consistently realized over many texts, set in diverse printing-houses. Now Shakespeare's plays exhibit 246 instances of between , to only 56 of betwixt . 25 In only three plays does betwixt occur more often than between —in Richard II , where the figures are between 1, betwixt 3; in Cymbeline , where the figures are between 3, betwixt 4; and in 1 Henry IV , where betwixt appears 7 times, between not at all. 1 Henry IV is thus easily the most anomalous play in its use of these forms. The contrast with 2 Henry IV , where the Quarto of 1600 has obviously been set from foul papers, is especially striking: there are 9 instances of between , none of betwixt . Again, we may argue that Compositors X and Y were not the sort of workmen to alter between to betwixt , and even if two other men set Qo it would be surprising if both were prejudiced against between , or if all instances of the connective fell into the stints of the one man who did have such a prejudice. Qo must have been set from a scribal transcript. Among / amongst supports the same conclusion. Shakespeare's overall preference is for among (95 times, amongst 41), though in eight plays amongst outnumbers among . The figures for 1 Henry IV ( among 1, amongst 3) contrast with the thoroughly typical figures for 2 Henry IV ( among 6, amongst 1). These same connectives furnish interesting evidence about the texts of Richard III . In F between occurs 8 times, betwixt once. F thus reflects Shakespeare's normal habits. In Q, in contrast, between appears 3 times, betwixt 7 times. 26 The lesser authority of Q is thus reflected in its atypical ratio of betwixt to between —also, perhaps, in its treatment of among / amongst : F does not use amongst , but twice has Shakespeare's preferred among ; Q once has nothing at the corresponding point, and once has amongst . Can either of the two compositors who set 1 Henry IV be identified with either of those who set Richard III ? It is impossible to be sure. The closest match is between Compositor X of 1 Henry IV and Compositor N of Richard III . Their spacing habits are identical: neither ever precedes a question mark by a space in an unjustified line, and neither spaces more than a tiny proportion of colons or commas. The spelling evidence is ambiguous: some of their preferences coincide ( do and bloud , for example), some differ. N and X may be the same workman, influenced by different spelling patterns in copy. There is less correspondence between Compositors Y and O. In their treatment of question marks and colons they are similar, setting spaces before about half of them, but though Y spaces more commas than X, he falls far short of O's actual preference for spaced commas. More significantly, in Richard III there is no trace of Y's liking for roman numerals in signatures. Spelling patterns bear some similarities, but many differences. It is time to attempt a summary of my findings and a discussion of their significance. First, it has been shown that two compositors (N and O) set Richard III , Q1 (1597), sheets H-M, and that 1 Henry IV, Q1 (1598), another product of Peter Short's printing house, was also set by two men (X and Y), not one, as has been supposed. The surviving fragment of 1 Henry IV , Qo, was probably set by two compositors, who may plausibly be identified with X and Y. It is possible, even likely, that Compositors X and N are one and the same man. Short's compositors divided typesetting evenly, setting half of a signature —exactly in Richard III , sometimes approximately in 1 Henry IV . This division of labour is associated with a skeleton pattern whereby a single skeleton is used for each forme of a sheet, but two skeletons alternate in successive sheets. A skeleton pattern of this kind is, in my experience, very common in sixteenth and seventeenth century Quartos, and equal division of typesetting by two men is a frequent accompaniment. Sheets A-G of Richard III , printed by Valentine Simmes, appear to have been set by one man. Thus three compositors worked on the play, punctuating the text in widely different ways. There is some evidence of heterogeneity in the manuscript copy for the Quarto. Moreover, variations in the spelling of O / Oh , which persist into Quarto reprints, are not perpetuated in F—a fact which may be relevant to the question of copy for F Richard III . There are excellent reasons for thinking that Q1 of 1 Henry IV was set with unusual fidelity to Qo, of which it was a reprint, and less substantial grounds for supposing that Qo itself fairly accurately reproduced its manuscript copy. This manuscript must, however, as a new item of evidence shows, have been a transcript of authorial papers, rather than actual holograph. For this reason, I believe that an editor should have no compunction about introducing colloquial and metrical elisions into his text, on his own authority and in deference to the obvious raciness of the dialogue—when, that is, he judges that Shakespeare himself is more likely to have written the contracted or elided than the full form. This is a contentious point, I know, but why should an editor act as if his own authority were less than that of some pedantic scribe? Bibliography, Fredson Bowers once stated, rests on "the impersonal inductive interpretation of physical facts according to rigorous laws of evidence." 27 Ideally this may be so, but in practice to undertake the bibliographical analysis of an Elizabethan play Quarto is rather like undergoing a Rorschach test. The investigator is confronted with physical facts certainly, but what he notices will differ from what another bibliographer might have noticed, and the facts observed may be open to more than one interpretation. Bibliographers seldom re-do one another's work. When a scholar of Hinman's stature claims that the 1598 Quarto of 1 Henry IV was set by a single compositor, his verdict, even though he withholds his evidence, will, quite understandably, be regarded as final. But Hinman was mistaken—as, in the matter of compositor discrimination, the most competent among us will often prove to be. The bibliographer who finds no more than one compositor in any but the shortest sixteenth-century Quarto has probably not stared at it for long enough or done enough counting. Howard-Hill's evidence from the spacing of punctuation has gone a long way towards settling the question of compositorial shares in the Shakespeare First Folio. 28 The advantage of this type of evidence is that, unlike spelling, it ought to be unaffected by copy. Examination of spacing practices, though apt to dull both eye and mind (for "Light seeking light doth light of light beguile"), should form part of any bibliographical analysis of an Elizabethan Quarto. We cannot afford to ignore anything of possible consequence. For, as D. F. McKenzie insisted, "It cannot . . . be too frequently stressed how difficult the task of isolating a compositor's work may be." 29</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) C. J. K. Hinman identified five workmen. A sixth came to light when in "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," T. H. Howard-Hill, Studies in Bibliography , 26 (1973), 61-106, distinguished between Compositor A of the Histories and Hinman's Compositor A of the Comedies, whom Howard-Hill renamed F. In "The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio," SB , 34 (1981), 96-117, Gary Taylor nominates Compositors H, I, and J for part of the other work commonly assigned to A. 2 "The Compositors of the Shakespeare Quartos Printed by Peter Short," PBSA , 65 (1971), 393-397; "Simmes's Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos," SB , 26 (1973), 37-60. Though Craven is wrong about 1 Henry IV and Short's section of Richard III , his articles contain much of value. 3 Hinman, introduction to the Clarendon Press facsimile of Henry IV, Part 1, 1598 (1966), p. ix.

W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), pp. 192-93. J. K. Walton disturbed this in The Copy for the Folio Text of "Richard III" (1955). Greg accepted Walton's conclusions in his review in The Library , 5th series, 11 (1956), 125-129; so at first did Fredson Bowers in his review in SQ , 10 (1959), 91-96, but he later withdrew his support in "The Copy for Folio Richard III ," SQ , 10 (1959), 541-544, and in Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). See also A. S. Cairncross, "Coincidental Variants in Richard III ," The Library , 5th series, 12 (1957), 187-190, and, especially, "The Quartos and the Folio Text of Richard III ," RES , n.s. 8 (1957), 225-233; J. K. Walton, "The Quarto Copy for the Folio Richard III ," RES , n.s. 10 (1959), 127-140 (pp. 139-140 consist of a reply by Cairncross); Silvano Gerevini, Il Testo del "Riccardo III" di Shakespeare (Pavia, 1957); Hardin Craig, A New Look at Shakespeare's Quartos (1961). Gerevini offered a summary (in Italian) of the whole debate in "Ancora sul Testo del Riccardo III ," English Miscellany , 21 (1970), 11-33. Walton's various restatements of his position, in response to Bowers, Smidt, and others, are best consulted in The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare (1971). In a study (not yet published) which uses computer concordances for a thorough analysis of spelling and punctuation, Gary Taylor concludes that both Q3 and Q6 served as F copy, in a pattern related to page-breaks in the Quartos and the Folio, and to major textual insertions. 7 Lo: with the colon is not used in Short's section, but Lo. appears twice and L. once. 8 Craven, SB , 26 (1973), 46.

The precision of my figures is thus illusory, but the counts were made without preconceptions and the essential pattern is unmistakable. 10 The figures include such locutions as "my gracious Lord" and "my Lord of Buckingham" when these are appellations directed at the lord rather than references to him. They exclude "my L. Maior" on H1. 11 The variability of the King speech prefixes was drawn to my attention by Professor Antony Hammond, who is editing the New Arden Richard III . 12 Both the chi-square test and the runs test mentioned below are described by M. Hammerton, Statistics for the Human Sciences (1975). They provide standard formulae for estimating the probability that observed results are due to chance. 13 The change was pointed out by George Walton Williams in a review of Smidt's Iniurious Impostors in MP , 36 (1966), 265-267. He attributed the setting of entrances towards the right margin over the bulk of the text to "both compositors' desire to save space"—he assumed that just one compositor set Simmes's section and one Short's section. 14 See S. W. Reid, "Some Spellings of Compositor B in the Shakespeare First Folio," SB , 29 (1976), 102-138 (129-130). Interested scholars may obtain from me copies of a paper which, using the techniques described by William S. Kable, "Compositor B, the Pavier Quartos, and Copy Spellings," SB , 21 (1968), 131-162, lists all Folio Richard III 's theoretically copy-reflecting spellings in B's stints and matches them against Q1, Q3, and Q6. 15 A1 is the title page (verso blank) and A2 has a head title, but otherwise there is continuity between sheet A and sheet C headlines. For a study of this pattern of skeletons in Simmes's Richard II and his share of Richard III , see Peter Davison, "The Selection and Presentation of Bibliographical Evidence," Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography , 1 (1977), 123 ff. 16 By a curious coincidence I count 394 commas within short lines in each compositor's stints: Y spaced 63, X 30. 17 But Mortimer's and Hotspur's "Ladies" contribute to the count. 18 A more complex, and, strictly speaking, more appropriate way to assess the significance of the disparity between the two men is to work out for each page the proportion of double 'o' spellings which are ligatured, and use a t-test to compare the two sets of proportions (for X's 40 pages and Y's 38), in order to determine the probability that they have been drawn randomly from a single population. The result is t = 2.0, 76 df, p &lt;0.05: the odds are less than one in twenty that the two sets of proportions belong to the same population, so the test supports the view that different compositorial habits are involved. 19 For a full list of Qo/Q1 variants, including accidentals, see S. B. Hemingway's New Variorum 1 Henry IV (1936), pp. 345-349. But at II.i.70 Hemingway has misread Qo's Saine as Sainc . 20 Evidence from the spacing of colons has been suppressed from the Qo part of the graph, because it tends to obscure the pattern formed by the other markers. Spaced/ unspaced colons for each page are as follows: C1 0/4, C1v 2/0, C2 0/3, C2v 0/1, C3 1/1, C3v 0/2, C4 0/0, C4v 0/0. 21 If Compositor Y set B4v of Q1, as the evidence graphed in Figure 1 seems to indicate, he reproduced the two apostrophes which he found in his Qo copy at this point, so it seems likely that he set apostrophes whenever he found them in his copy. As he set none in any of his other Q1 pages before G3, it follows that there were no others in his copy until he reached G3. Therefore, if X and Y worked together on Qo, X not Y introducing apostrophes, Y in Q1 must have been setting mainly from his own Qo pages—except on B4v and from G3 onwards. 22 Hinman, Clarendon facsimile, p. ix; G. Blakemore Evans in the Riverside Shakespeare (1974), p. 881, inclines towards the same view. But Davison in his New Penguin edition (1968) suspects that "the printer's copy . . . was in Shakespeare's handwriting" (p. 245), as does the New Arden (1960) editor, A. R. Humphreys. For evidence suggesting that the copy was a transcript, see F. Bowers, "Establishing Shakespeare's Text: Poins and Peto in 1 Henry IV," SB , 34 (1981), 189-198. 23 I refer to the two lists, (a)-(e) on p. lxix, and (a)-(h) on p. lxx; (d) of the first list contains two instances; I ignore knowest in (b) of the second list. 24 J. Dover Wilson's phrase in his New Cambridge edition of 1 Henry IV (1946), p. 104. In "Linguistic Evidence for the Date of Shakespeare's Addition to Sir Thomas More," Notes and Queries , 223 (1978), 154-156, I showed that ten colloquial and contracted forms which Shakespeare used more often in his later plays could be added together and divided into the number of lines in a play to yield an index to the degree of colloquialism of each play's orthography. 2 Henry IV , with one selected colloquial form to every 20 lines, is twice as colloquial as 1 Henry IV , with one to every 40 lines. For each play a Quarto serves as copy text. 2 Henry IV has 43 instances of a as the weakened form of he ; this is completely absent from the Quarto of 1 Henry IV . 25 I derive these figures from Marvin Spevack's Concordance (1968-75). They are for the full forms of the words only, because Shakespeare prefers aphetic twixt to tween . 26 Q once omits betweene where it appears in a Folio stage direction; but Q contains betwixt in a passage absent from F, and it once reads betweene where F has tweene , which does not contribute to F's total for between . Simmes's compositor set betwixt 5 times, between twice; Short's Compositor N set betwixt twice; Short's Compositor O set betweene once. The fact that both Simmes's compositor and Short's Compositor N set betwixt in places where F has betweene strongly suggests that they found betwixt in their manuscript copy. 27 Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964), p. 156. 28 SB , 26 (1973), 61-106. 29 In a review of Bowers's Textual and Literary Criticism in The Library , 5th series, 14 (1959), 211.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of the Second Quarto (1619) of King Lear by Richard Knowles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To date, three theories of the composition of the second (Pavier) quarto edition of Shakespeare's King Lear have been proposed. William S. Kable, following the example of D. F. McKenzie, 1 has argued from spelling changes between Q1 (1608) and Q2 (1619) of Lr. that the whole play was set by Compositor B of the First Folio. 2 In his dissertation of 1971 3 John F. Andrews, also arguing largely from spelling evidence, has revived Madeleine Doran's suggestion 4 that the first eight sheets were set by one compositor and the last three by another; he calls the first man Compositor F (but later G) 5 and identifies the second as Folio Compositor B. Subsequently Peter W. M. Blayney has questioned the reliability of Kable's spelling analyses and has hypothesized, partly on the basis of patterns of skeleton alternations, that all of the Pavier editions except Sir John Oldcastle were set by two compositors working concurrently throughout. 6 On the grounds of additional evidence of the recurrence and migration of distinctive types, 7 I wish to propose a still different theory: that the second quarto of Lr. was set from two type cases by two compositors working concurrently throughout sheets A to H, and thereafter from one of these type cases by a third compositor who by himself set the last three sheets, I to L. New evidence that Q2 plays some part in determining the Folio text of Lr. makes such a proposal as this potentially more useful than it would have seemed to be a year or two ago. Although previous attempts to establish the presence of Q2 Lr. behind the Folio text, most notably that of Andrew Cairncross, have not been convincing, 8 in a forthcoming article Gary Taylor produces important evidence that the pages set by Compositor E in F1 Lr. more closely agree with Q2 than with Q1 in punctuation and a number of unusual spellings. 9 If compositorial preferences and habits helped to shape the text of Q2 and thereby the text in F1, one naturally wants to be able to distinguish the Q2 compositors and their characteristics. But even if Q2 proves to have had little or no influence on the received text of Lr. , a study of its printing may still have a general interest for what light it may shed on the working methods of William Jaggard's men; the compositors who worked on Q2 Lr. almost certainly worked on other Pavier quartos and very possibly on the First Folio. Thomas Pavier's quarto of Lr. was printed in Jaggard's shop in 1619, from many of the same types used some three to four years later to set F1. 10 It was evidently set by formes from a copy of Q1 in which sheets D, G, and H were in the uncorrected state and formes E(o) and K(o) were corrected (Doran, p. 3). Though Q2 is not a page-for-page reprint of Q1, accurate casting-off of Q1 copy must have been relatively easy. The collation of Q1 is A 2 B-L 4 the text begins on B1 and ends on L4, and it is printed 38 lines to a page. The collation of Q2 is A-L 4 ; its text begins on A2 and ends on L4, and it is printed 37 lines to a page. Thus 79 pages of text in Q1 are stretched into 85 pages in Q2. Printing of one fewer lines per page in Q2 achieves a little more than a third of the stretching; the rest is accomplished through the style of the setting. A line of white space is added before most entrance directions; stage directions in the margin and stage directions or speeches doubled up in the same line with another speech or part-line in Q1 are usually lined separately in Q2; a few turnovers and turnunders are carried down and indented to make a separate part-line; and there is some deliberate relining. 11 The result of such clean copy and a regular house style was very accurate casting-off for Q2. Despite occasional inconsistencies, all three compositors were able to adhere fairly closely to style and needed to make few adjustments in spacing and lining. Only one page is a little short, and a small handful of others show a little crowding, none of it very serious. Except in cases of deliberate relining, the length of the prose line in Q2 follows that in Q1 very closely (though in long passages some differences occur). In fact, in the five instances where Q1 divides and hyphenates a word at the end of a page (B4 v , C2 v , D1, G2, and I4), the same end-of-line word-division occurs midpage in Q2 in four cases and differs in the fifth by only two letters. Obviously the Q2 compositors adjusted their measures to allow close copying of the Q1 line and thus to facilitate their working from cast-off copy. Perhaps it was to approximate the Q1 line more accurately that the two compositors who set sheets A and B both seem to have reset their measure from 94 to 95 mm. starting with sheet C. The only evidence of press-correction that has appeared to date is a pair of variants in forme A(o), where in A3 of Folger copy 1 begot (l. 26) and marry (l. 33) read bgot and matry . 12 As the following chart shows, two skeletons were used in printing Q2 Lr. Skeleton I Running title I: A2 v , A3 v , C1, C2, E1, E2, G1, G2, I1, I2 R-t II: A3, A4, C2 v , C1 v , E2 v , E1 v , G2 v , G1 v , I2 v , I1 v R-t III: C3, C4, E3, E4, G3, G4, I3, I4 R-t IV: A4 v , C4 v , C3 v , E4 v , E3 v , G4 v , G3 v , I4 v , I3 v Skeleton II R-t V: B1, B2, D2 v , D1 v , F2 v , F1 v , H2 v , H1 v , K2 v , K1 v , L2 v , L1 v R-t VI: B2 v , B1 v , D1, D2, F1, F2, H1, H2, K1, K2, L1, L2 R-t VII: B3, B4, D3, D4, F3, F4, H3, H4, K3, K4, L3, L4 R-t VIII: B4 v , B3 v , D4 v , D3 v , F4 v , F3 v , H4 v , H3 v , K4 v , K3 v , L4 v , L3 v Skeleton I was used to print both sides of sheets A, C, E, G, and I, and skeleton II was used to print both sides of the alternate sheets B, D, F, H, and K, and of the final sheet L. It is a somewhat unusual pattern for a two-skeleton quarto; ordinarily one skeleton would be used in printing the first side of a sheet and the second skeleton would be used in perfecting the sheet. But what is particularly interesting about this pattern is that it runs through the first nine of the ten Pavier quartos: As a general rule [in these Qq] both formes of a sheet use the same skeleton. Before HV sheet E, only four of the sixty-eight full sheets are perfected by a skeleton other than that which printed the white paper. In addition to this, alternate sheets use alternate skeletons. The alternation is only broken five times, and some measure of consistency can even be seen in the interruptions. Three times the same skeleton is found in the last two sheets of a play [ 3H6, Lr. , and Per. ] (excluding PER Bb), and once [ Yorkshire Tragedy ] in the first two sheets. The pattern breaks down in the middle of HV, and apart from a slight doubt about the first sheet, only one skeleton appears in S[ ir ] J[ ohn ] O[ ldcastle ]. Where a headline exists in two states within a sheet, the outer forme has priority in each case. It can therefore be assumed that setting was at least partly by formes. (Blayney, p. 199) The consistency of this pattern from one play to another suggests a regular plan of printing decided upon from the beginning of the series and closely adhered to up to the last volume. Of the eight running titles in Q2 Lr. , all of which read The History of King Lear , four suffered damage in the course of printing. The f in title V is whole in B1, damaged in B2; in some copies (e.g., Folger copy 2, British Library copy C.34.K19, Newberry Library copy) its top is just beginning to bend backward in B2, in all other copies that I have seen it is bent sharply up and back, and in all its appearances in D, F, H, K, and L the top has been imperfectly bent back into its original shape. The letter f also degenerates in titles I (whole in G1, topless in G2 and in both formes of I) and VI (whole in H1, topless in H2 and in K and L). The final r of title VII is whole in K3 but lacks part of its curl in K4 and in L. Titles V and VI exchange places between B and D and remain reversed in F, H, K, and L. All of this skeleton evidence indicates two things: since the type breakage always appears in the inner forme, it suggests that here, as apparently elsewhere in the Pavier quartos, the outer forme was normally printed first; and since the type breakage and reversed titles reappear in normal sequence in eight of the eleven sheets, one may safely assume that all of the sheets were printed in alphabetical succession. Although the type breakage in the running titles suggests that the outer forme was normally printed first, it is impossible to know that for certain except for the four sheets (B, G, H, and K) where such type damage occurs. Neither with scanning light and loupe nor with a three-dimensional microscope (kindly made available by Mr. John Aubrey, Supervisor of Special Collections) was I able to find type impressions in the pages of the Newberry copy of Q2 Lr. which could decide the question. Since in all known instances here and elsewhere in the Pavier quartos the outer forme is printed first, I simply assume it to be the usual practice, lacking any evidence to the contrary. The recurrences and migrations of distinctive types show very clearly that the first nine sheets of Q2 Lr. were set from two cases of type, which for the sake of convenience and custom I call case x and case y. 13 Types from case x appear in sheets A, C, E(o), F(o), G(o), H(o), and I(o), and those from case y in sheets B, D, E(i), F(i), G(i), H(i), and I(i); a few types from case x also appear in G(i). In the last two sheets, K and L, types from both cases appear, but it is evident from the distribution patterns and from residual or linking types from earlier pages that the single compositor now completing the book is working from case x. The flow chart in Figure 1 indicates the chief and most immediate sources of the types in each forme; individual linking types, which show up in a later forme after having lain in the case during the setting of intervening formes, are not represented in this chart, important though they are as confirming evidence. As is usually the case in this kind of analysis, I have had to discount a few appearances of individual types in the wrong places, assuming that they represent misidentification on my part, or confusion of two different types that have sustained similar damage or malformation, or that they are subject to one or another of Hinman's explanations of such anomalies (Hinman, I, 126-138). The distinctive types also establish the place of Q2 Lr. in the whole series of Pavier quartos. When William Neidig of the University of Wisconsin proved in 1910 that the ten Pavier title pages, despite their different dates, had all been printed in 1619, he also established their order through the press: The Whole Contention (two plays), A Yorkshire Tragedy, Pericles, The Merchant of Venice, The Merry Wives of Windsor, King Lear, Henry V , and Sir John Oldcastle ; the place of A Midsummer Night's Dream was left in doubt. It has generally been accepted that the plays themselves were printed in this same order. 14 On the evidence of watermarks Peter Blayney has recently placed MND just prior to Lr. (pp. 196-197). Although its title page was printed immediately before that of Lr. , the body of Wiv. bears no typographical relation to Q2 Lr. , being printed in a larger and different font, while on the other hand a number of distinctive types in the first three sheets of Lr. appear in the last three sheets of MND . 15 The pattern of migration of types from one book to the other is somewhat complicated, and the model of it that I have constructed in Figure 1 will require confirmation from a study of the types in the whole of Q2 MND . For case y at least there is an unmistakable link: a large number of types from MND H(i) reappear in Lr. B(o). The complication is that types from both formes of MND sheets G are found in both case x and case y. That fact might suggest that the printing of MND was interrupted after sheet G was printed and the two cases of type used on another job, where they became mixed; but the fact that only one sheet of MND remained to be printed and that forme E(i) seems to have remained as standing type until the printing of that last sheet seems to argue against an interruption at this point. It is also possible that F(i) and G(i) should reverse places with their forme-mates F(o) and G(o) in the chart, as having been set at the opposite cases; but I think the patterns of distribution suggest otherwise. I have assumed that most of G(i) was originally set from and mostly distributed back into case x because about twice as many recognizable types from MND G(i) reappear in Lr. A(o) (set at case x) as show up in B(i) (set at case y), and similarly that G(o) was originally set from and mostly distributed back into case y because about three times as many recognizable types from MND G(o) reappear in H(i) (set at case y) as in Lr. A(o) (set at case x). I assume, that is, that most of the types were distributed back into the cases that they originally came from, and that the total number of types distributed into each case will be roughly in proportion to the number of individual types that can be recognized in each case. Confirming evidence comes from linking types from the formes previously set: types from F(i) show up in A(o) (case x) but not in B(i) (case y); conversely, a number of types from F(o) reappear in H(i) (case y), but only two or three from F(o) reappear in A(o), and I assume that they simply came directly from G(o), where I failed to recognize them, rather than from the sort boxes of case y. Forme H(o) of MND shows no trace of types from MND sheets F and G; since several of its distinctive types are readily recognizable in E(i), E(i) seems for some reason to have been left standing during the setting of F(i) and G(i) and was then finally distributed before the composing of H(o); therefore H(o) was likely to have been set by the same compositor and at the same case (case x) as were F(i) and G(i). On these facts and assumptions one may tentatively advance a hypothetical explanation of the typographical relations of Q2 MND and Q2 Lr. Since the last three sheets of MND seem to have been set from two type cases and, as Peter Blayney has shown (p. 198), with two skeletons used for the most part in the same unusual pattern of alternation as is found in Lr. , one may safely suppose that the last three sheets of MND were set by two compositors working more or less concurrently; since the type cases are the same for both plays, one may even think it likely that the same two compositors who set the last sheets of MND continued at their cases to begin setting the early sheets of the next Pavier quarto, Q2 Lr. It looks as if Compositor 1, after setting MND G(i), distributes the long-standing type pages from E(i) and begins to set H(o) sometime before his fellow compositor at case y begins to set H(i), the last forme for this play. He finishes while Compositor 2 is distributing types from G(o) in order to set H(i). Apparently Compositor 1 begins work right away on the first forme of the next play, A(o) of Lr. , before G(i) has been unlocked. Since both G(i) and H(o) are locked up, and since one of Jaggard's type cases, as Hinman has shown (I, 96, n. 1) held about 16,000 ens, or less than three quarto formes, Compositor 1 found himself somewhat short of type, and "poached" (to use Hinman's word [I, 133]) some types from the forme, G(o), that his mate was presently distributing, very probably from the same distribution frame or bench. 16 He may have begun setting Lr. A(o) then, but before completing it he distributed most of the now available G(i), whose types appear only in the last two pages (3 and 4 v ) of A(o). Meanwhile Compositor 2 has finished MND H(i) and is about to begin Lr. B(o), and, although only two or three rather doubtful types from MND G(i) seem to appear in Lr. B(o), I think it likely that at this point Compositor 2 poaches back from G(i), then being distributed, a quantity of type roughly equal to that recently borrowed by Compositor 1; the reason so little shows up in B(o) is that it is buried by types soon distributed from H(i). It begins to show up in the first page of the next forme, B1 v , which Compositor 2 apparently set before beginning to distribute any types from B(o). The precise details of these speculations will have to await further confirmation from the study of types throughout the whole of Q2 MND , but I think that there is already sufficient evidence from types to support Peter Blayney's assignment of MND just prior to Lr. in the Pavier series. As I have already suggested above, the evidence from types in Q2 Lr. indicates that the composition of that play was at first divided between two typesetters, each working at his own case, until at some point in sheet I or K the work was assumed and completed by one compositor at one case. Although not proven absolutely from the evidence of types alone, this hypothesis is far more likely than the alternative supposition of Kable and Andrews that one compositor working alone set the first eight sheets, for it is hard to imagine why throughout most of a book one compositor should shuttle from one case to another as he set each new sheet or forme. Such a method of working is contrary to the normal procedures in Jaggard's shop during the printing of the Folio, if not indeed hitherto unknown in any shop. It may be barely conceivable that one compositor completely set sheets A through H from alternate cases while a companion compositor, perhaps an apprentice, distributed types from the wrought-off formes to replenish the other case just used to set the previous sheet or forme; but such an arrangement seems very unlikely. Hinman has shown that the normal pattern for Jaggard's compositors when they set the Folio was for the same compositor to work at the same case. The clearest example that he offers of the exceptional instance when a compositor moves to another case to allow a fellow compositor to distribute at the first case has since been discredited. Hinman thought that Compositor B moved to case x to set Timon Gg3 while Compositor E distributed into case y, but Trevor Howard-Hill has recently demonstrated that Gg3 was set by E, not by B. 17 Since composition, requiring justification and constant reference to copy, would take much more time than distribution, a division of labor between them would not have been an efficient arrangement throughout the printing of a whole book (unless perhaps we may imagine the apprentice regularly doing some other job as well). The much more likely and normal method of work to be inferred from the evidence of types is that the composition of sheets A through H was divided equally between Compositor 1 working at case x and Compositor 2 working at case y. Furthermore, the distribution patterns and sequence of formes in the first four sheets seem clearly to indicate two men rather than one. Between the printing of the white-paper and perfecting formes of sheets A, B, and D there was clearly a period of time long enough for the white-paper forme to be machined and for its types to be washed, unlocked, and distributed before the next forme was set at the same case. If during these interims the supposed single compositor continued to work on Q2 Lr. rather than on another book, he would in all probability have begun work on the perfecting forme of the same sheet. What we find instead, if we accept the premise that one compositor is shuttling from case to case, is a sequence of formes that makes no sense: A(o)—B(o)—A(i)—B(i)—C(o)—D(o)—C(i)—D(i). Such a sequence would double the number of sheets being worked at one time and multiply the possibilities for confusion, delay, and error without any evident compensations. The hypothesis of one compositor working alternately at two cases would imply, for Q2 Lr. , a pattern of composition that is unaccountable, disadvantageous, and hitherto unknown. Far preferable is the conclusion more obviously indicated by the evidence, that in setting the first four and probably the first eight sheets two compositors worked concurrently, each following the normal practice of working at his own case and distributing his own types, and each, in sheets A through D, setting the perfecting forme for his own sheet. Once each of these two compositors had set two initial sheets and had disposed of all the standing type from MND , they seem to have settled down to a firm pattern of collaboration on the next four sheets. Compositor 1 at case x set the white-paper forme of each sheet, and Compositor 2 at case y set the perfecting forme. The only aberration is signalled by the appearance of some types from case x in forme G(i). These seem mainly to come from F1 and F4 v and to appear mainly in G2 and G3 v . Two explanations suggest themselves: Compositor 2 poached some types from the just-unlocked forme F(o), perhaps because his case seemed a little low, or Compositor 1 set a page or two of G(i) at case x to help out his fellow. The admittedly sparse evidence seems to rule out the latter possibility: the presence in all four pages of G(i) of a few linking types from E(i) indicates that those pages were all set at case y; and the absence from G(i) of unmistakable linking types from case x (from sheets A and C) makes it improbable that any parts of the pages of G(i) were set at case x. For some reason Compositor 2 at case y began to set G(i) before distributing the previous forme. Since he had always, prior to this, distributed the previous forme first (unlike his fellow at case x, who twice had set new formes, C(i) and F(o), without first distributing the prior ones), and since Compositor 2 earlier had apparently been prompt to reclaim some type from MND G(i) to replace what his fellow had poached from MND G(o), it is possible that case y had a somewhat smaller stock of types than case x. If so, that would explain why, with F(i) of Lr. still locked up, Compositor 2 now found it advisable to appropriate some type from a couple of standing pages of F(o); and it may have been partly to repay this borrowed type that later on at least some of the type from G(i) was distributed into case x. Two generalizations can be made about the work of the two compositors in the first eight sheets of Q2 Lr. The first is that they seem to be working together: for the first four sheets they work in parallel, each setting both formes of two sheets at his own case and using his own skeleton; then for the next four sheets they work in close collaboration, one man setting the white-paper and the other man the perfecting forme of each sheet, sharing both skeletons between them; and then finally, as we shall presently see, they are both taken off the job together. In the transition between MND and Lr. , a quantity of types borrowed by one man is immediately reclaimed by the other. Although D. F. McKenzie has forcefully taught us to doubt that apparently regular patterns in a book's physical features necessarily imply a regular method of work, 18 such parallelism as we find here is strong temptation to invoke Mill's inductive method of concomitant variation. When each compositor's variation in working method is mirrored by the second compositor, one may reasonably suspect a causal relation, such as a close and perhaps continuous collaboration between the two men. The second generalization to be made about the work of these two men is that it was obviously not confined to Lr. at this time. The fact that Compositor 2 consistently and Compositor 1 more than half the time distribute the previous forme before setting another one implies a regular delay of at least half a day of press time between the completion of composition of one forme and the beginning of the next. Hinman estimated that the setting of one Folio page (which at 132 lines is roughly comparable to the 148 lines in a forme of Q2 Lr. ) would take about a half a day, and the presswork to print 1200 perfected sheets would take a whole day (I, 44-45), or a half-day for one forme. During that half-day between setting a forme and beginning to distribute its types back into the case to set the next forme, each compositor must have been employed at other jobs. A tempting suggestion is that one or both were employed in setting the Pavier edition of Wiv. , which was composed at about this time in a different type face. At sheet I the typesetting of Q2 Lr. is taken over by a third compositor and becomes a one-man operation. That this compositor is a different person from either of the two previous compositors is a certainty. Madeleine Doran (pp. 36-38) noted fifty years ago that from sheet I(o) to the end of Q2 Lr. there is a marked change to more carefully lined verse, more freely emended readings, more careless mistakes, heavier punctuation, and a sudden change from the spellings Glo(u)cester and Glost. to Gloster and Glo. John Andrews's studies of prose and verse alignment, substantive and metrical alterations, punctuation, and preferred spellings have further confirmed that the habits of the compositor of the last three sheets of Q2 Lr. are markedly unlike those evident in the first eight sheets. I have applied one further test, the frequency of spaced commas in short lines, introduced by Trevor Howard-Hill ( op. cit. , 1973). The average percentage of spaced commas in the first eight sheets is 9%; in the last three sheets the average is 41.5%, a significant difference. This new compositor phases out case y by distributing its two standing formes of type and setting only one more forme at that case. After setting I(o) at case x he distributes G(i), from case y, into case x and uses its skeleton to impose I(o). He appears also to have unlocked and distributed parts of three pages of H(i) at about this time, but since so few of its types—only four that I can identify with any degree of certainty—reappear in I(i), and since its skeleton is not used until after K(o) is set, H(i) seems to have passed mainly into the hands of another compositor, perhaps distributing it into another case for use on another job. Compositor 3 abandons case y after setting I(i) there, whose types and Skeleton I disappear from Q2 Lr. after its printing. Linking types from case x appear in all of the remaining formes, making it clear that Compositor 3 is working at that case from now on. I do not automatically assume that because K(o) was printed before K(i) it was also set first, but in fact any setting sequence other than K(o)—K(i)—L(o)—L(i) implies the disappearance of clusters of types from the first forme until their reappearance in the fourth forme. The one difficulty with this sequence is a single anomalous type, a capital T from K4.27 that immediately reappears in L3.18 without the prior distribution of K(i). Since the type begins a line in K(i), I assume that its presence in L(o) can be explained as the result of the kind of stripping accident described by Hinman (I, 128-130) in which a peripheral type displaced in stripping is tossed into the case and reappears in the next forme to be set. Some slight crowding in pages L3 v and L4 may be evidence that L(o), with its blank page L4 v , may already have been completed, but not necessarily. In L3 v both stretching and crowding go on simultaneously: one part-line of verse is added by relining Q1 verse, and four speeches that in Q1 share a line with another speech are given separate lines, while at the same time the customary line of space before an entrance is omitted, six lines of verse are reduced to four-and-a-fraction lines of false prose, and two speeches stay doubled with another on the same line. In L4 three speeches doubled in Q1 are given separate lines, but another speech is left doubled and an entrance direction is not centered and spaced but is left flush right and doubled with another short speech in the same line. This slight crowding in L(i) does not necessarily mean, however, that L(o) had already been printed: in order that Q2 should pass for Q1 under casual inspection, Pavier or Jaggard may have intended to keep L4 v blank even if it turned out to be "printed" last. As well as I can determine from microfilm, types from both K(o) and L(o) appear in sheet A of Henry V , apparently the next quarto printed in the Pavier series. I had expected that types from case y would reappear in sheet B of H5 , but it seems rather to contain a mixture of types from both case x and case y as well as a large number of new and unfamiliar types. Perhaps case y had been involved in another job in the meantime or had been replenished from some standing type. How the case x types got there must be answered by study of a live copy of H5 ; a likely place would be sheet L(i) of Lr. The pattern of printing and distribution described above clearly implies, contrary to all previous views, that two men set sheets A through H and a single man set sheets I through L. One large question remaining is whether either of the compositors of the first eight sheets is the man who set the last three. To test this possibility I reclassified all of the data in John Andrews's dissertation about lineation, substantive and metrical alteration, and spelling in the first eight sheets, dividing it between the two men implied by the pattern of types. The result is a picture of two compositors so similar in their habits that much further study will be needed to distinguish one confidently from the other. The composite picture of both of them that Andrews gives in describing a hypothetical "Compositor G" applies very closely to either of them and distinguishes them both from the third compositor of sheets I to L. My own test of spaced periods implies the same thing: Compositors 1 and 2 of Lr. (and incidentally of the last three sheets of MND ) have very similar spacing habits, markedly different from those of Compositor 3. The main consequence of the foregoing analysis, then, is that all previous opinions of the compositors of Q2 Lr. will have to be revised. Kable's theory of one compositor is clearly untenable, Blayney's conjecture of two men working throughout is closer to the mark, and Andrews's distinction of a new compositor in sheets I to L holds up while his Compositor G turns out to be a composite of two men. Who these compositors were is a question that needs further study. Andrews's and Kable's identification of (at least) one of them as Folio Compositor B has been called into serious question by S. W. Reid: "The spelling practices of B in F1 are like those of Andrews' 'G' as much as they are like those of his 'B,' and B's spellings are more often like the spellings of both, combined, than they are like those of either." 19 Causing still further doubts is Blayney's series of caveats about compositor identification: that two or more apprentices trained by the same printer or schooled by the same master might show almost identical spelling habits; that a compositor's habits in 1619 might not be those of 1622; that our knowledge that Jaggard bound no apprentices between 1614 and 1622 20 helps us not at all to know how many of the four apprentices that he freed (in 1607, 1614, 1617, and 1619) stayed with him, how many men he employed who were apprenticed elsewhere, or how many men he might sometimes have hired temporarily (as for such a project as the Pavier series of quartos). Blayney concludes, "The assumption that a Jaggard book of 1619 necessarily contains a single type set by any member of the Folio team" is "unsound" (p. 182). One further specific reason he gives for doubting that Compositor B had a hand in Q2 Lr. is that there the name of Lear's counterpart is spelled Gloster or Glocester , whereas in Compositor B's share of the Folio Lr. Glocester is never used, Gloster appears only five times, while in 21 other occurrences the name contains a u ( Glouster 14, Gloucester 7). 21 The spaced comma test also casts some doubt: the highest percentage of spaced commas set by any compositor in Q2 Lr. is 41.5%, but Howard-Hill attests that Compositor B regularly prefers a space after commas and that in his work unspaced commas are relatively rare ( op. cit. , 1973, p. 67). The whole question of the Pavier quarto compositors needs further work; and if Q2 Lr. is any measure, that work will have to include the slow and laborious task of types analysis to determine whether and when two compositors of very similar habits are at work simultaneously. One more problem remains to be touched on: the pattern of skeleton alternation in Q2 Lr. , in which the same skeleton appears in both formes of alternate sheets. To begin with, it is not a usual pattern either for a single compositor (Q2 Lr. Compositor 3 discontinues it when he is working alone) or for two men working together, as is the case in Lr. sheets A to H. The usual pattern would be for one forme to go into one skeleton and for the perfecting forme to go into the other. Yet in setting sheets A to D each man seems to hang onto his own skeleton from one forme to the next, and then in sheets E to H, when Compositor 1 is setting all the outer formes and Compositor 2 all the inners and we would expect to find the normal pattern of one skeleton associated with outer formes and the other with inners, we find instead that both skeletons are passed back and forth alternately between the compositors. An order of printing such as Skeleton I I II II I I Forme E(o) E(i) F(o) F(i) G(o) G(i) is perfectly possible, given that the half-day delay between formes that I have noted above would have provided plenty of time for Compositor 1 to retrieve the wrought-off and rinsed forme E(o), unlock it, and hand skeleton I over to Compositor 2 who, working in an alternating pattern, would subsequently use it to impose the perfecting forme E(i). The question yet remains why, having apparently held on to their own formes when setting A to D, the compositors should now pass them back and forth, and even why such a pattern of sharing required more than one skeleton. The alternative order Skeleton I II I II etc. Forme E(o) F(o) E(i) F(i) makes even less sense if E(o) and E(i), F(o) and F(i), etc. are being set simultaneously. And yet this unusual pattern of skeleton alternation from one sheet to the next, which appears in nine of the ten Pavier quartos, continues unchanged in Q2 Lr. even though three different methods of printing (in A-D, E-H, and I-L) succeed one another and though each of the three compositors at one time or another uses each of the skeletons. The distribution evidence in Fig. 1 suggests the most likely explanation: that by the time Compositor 1 came to impose F(o), he had pulled ahead of Compositor 2 by about a forme. He could easily have done so, since his formes A(o) and A(i) together contain only five full pages, a short first page, and a title page as against the eight full pages of sheet B set by Compositor 2, and since he could have set C(i) or F(o) or both immediately after imposing the previous formes whereas Compositor 2 always waited for the previous forme to come back from the press before composing the next one. The distribution evidence shows that no types from E(o) appear in F(o), and therefore that E(o) may still have been locked up in Skeleton I. Skeleton II, however, was now or would soon be vacant, since Compositor 2 distributed D(i) before setting E(i). Compositor 1 would then quite naturally have taken Skeleton II to impose the pages of F(o); and we know that he distributed E(o) before setting G(o), thus freeing Skeleton I for Compositor 2 to claim for the imposing of E(i). Thus would begin the swapping of skeletons that continues throughout the rest of the collaboration of the two men; and the fact that they continue to swap them, rather than lapse back into their former practice of holding on to the same skeleton, can be explained also by the distribution evidence. What results is a pattern that is regular but complicated because of the need to adapt an order of setting to a different order of printing of the formes. Assuming that Compositor 1 stayed about one forme ahead of his mate, the order of setting would be as follows: The only modification that the distribution pattern suggests is that, since Compositor 1 distributes all or most of G(o) and most of F(o) before setting H(o) while Compositor 2 breaks pattern to begin setting his next forme, G(i), with only minimal distribution from F(o), G(i) might possibly have been set abreast of or even a little ahead of H(o). In any case the order of printing the formes would have been the regular, and different, one: E(o)—E(i)—F(o)—F(i) and so on. When the necessary adjustments are made between these two sequences, the skeletons migrate naturally to alternate sheets and from forme to forme-mate: The intermediary steps are as follows: F(o) is imposed in vacant Skeleton II. Compositor 1 distributes E(o), freeing Skeleton I, and begins to set G(o). E(i) is completed and imposed in Skeleton I. It is printed before the already imposed F(o) in order to perfect sheet E before a new sheet is begun. F(o) is now printed. Compositor 2 distributes E(i), freeing Skeleton I, and begins to set F(i). G(o) is completed and imposed in vacant Skeleton I. F(i) is completed, and must be printed before the already imposed G(o) in order to perfect sheet F before a new sheet is begun. In order to vacate Skeleton II, both compositors strip and distribute F(o), sharing its types. F(i) is imposed in Skeleton II and is printed, while Compositor 2 begins to set G(i). G(o) is printed, and Compositor 1 strips and distributes its four pages before setting pages 3 and 4 v of H(o), thus freeing Skeleton I. G(i) is completed and must be printed next whether or not H(o) has been completely set. Evidently Skeleton I is still available to impose G(i). Compositor 2 unlocks and begins to distribute F(i), vacating Skeleton II. H(o) is imposed in Skeleton II and printed, and Compositor 2 begins to set H(i). This ends the collaboration of Compositors 1 and 2. At about this point Compositor 3 takes over. Either he or Compositor 1 distributes H(o), vacating Skeleton II for the imposition and printing of the perfecting forme H(i). Compositor 3 sets I(o) and strips Skeleton I from G(i) in order to impose I(o); he then distributes G(i) to replenish case x. Evidence that H(i) is unlocked and distributed at this point is slight and doubtful, and I have speculated that it may have been in the hands of another compositor; in any case neither the majority of its types nor its skeleton is used in setting and printing I(i). When I(o) returns from press its Skeleton I is stripped to impose I(i) and send it to press. At least by the time Compositor 3 finishes K(o), Skeleton II is freed from H(i), and he uses it to impose K(o). Henceforth he works only at case x, retrieving the same types and using only Skeleton II; Skeleton I and case y types do not reappear in Q2 Lr. He sets K(i), retrieves K(o) from the press and distributes it to free its skeleton and send K(i) to the press; sets L(o), retrieves and distributes K(i); and finally sets L(i). This explanation of the pattern of skeleton sharing in Q2 Lr. is consistent with all of the facts of the distribution of types. Though it may seem complex when presented in all its detail, it all follows logically from the simple premise that Compositor 1 got ahead of Compositor 2 fairly early on. Thereafter each man keeps borrowing the other's skeleton simply because it is the only one vacant or is the one that can soonest be vacated. The one obvious objection to be raised against such a scheme is that, having finished setting F(o) before his mate had finished E(i), Compositor 1 might logically have proceeded to the next forme that would be printed, F(i), rather than start a new sheet with G(o) and so continue a forme ahead. That is certainly a possibility, but not a necessity; the two men may have simply decided to stick to their agreement to share the setting of each sheet from E onwards, one man setting all the outer formes and the other all the inners, perhaps in the expectation that Compositor 2 would catch up before long. Nonetheless, it may be prudent to consider two alternative possibilities, both suggested to me by Professor Robert K. Turner. The simpler is that the two skeletons had some difference, such as gutter sticks of different widths, that necessitated each skeleton's backing itself if inner and outer formes were to register. The Newberry copy of Q2 Lr. is too tightly bound to test this theory with certainty, but a thin slip inserted down to the fold between conjugate pages of several sheets reveals no apparent differences in the gutter widths of the two skeletons. 22 The other possibility is that Q2 Lr. was printed simultaneously on two presses. It is in fact possible to work out a pattern whereby two presses might have printed this book, one press printing all the outer formes and the other all the inners. Despite the changes in the number of compositors and in the ways they shared the work, if press 1 is continually one forme ahead of press 2, the two skeletons will alternate back and forth between the two presses with absolute regularity. One might be tempted, therefore, to think that the two-press method itself might be solely responsible for the alternating pattern of skeleton use in Q2 Lr. The first four sheets offer no difficulty for this theory, since each compositor, shuttling from one press to the other, keeps retrieving his own skeleton and type. In all the remaining formes printed during their collaboration, however, each man retrieves his own type but, having unlocked and distributed it, then swaps skeletons with his mate. For this odd behavior the two-press theory seems to offer no explanation; it would have made much more sense for the men to hang on to their own skeletons, as they had been doing so far. In that case we would find, in sheets E through H, that one skeleton is always associated with outer formes and the other with inner formes; instead, they alternate. In order to explain the compositors' change of method of working we have to fall back on a theory such as one man's getting ahead of the other and imposing his pages in his fellow's skeleton because it was readily available and his own was not—exactly as we have already been able to do without resort to a theory of two presses. Two-press printing of Q2 Lr. remains a possibility, of course, but it is neither sufficient nor necessary as an explanation of the bibliographical facts. It may also imply a degree of regularity in method more ideal than practical in a busy shop like Jaggard's, which might handle a variety of overlapping jobs at once. Still, if Pavier and Jaggard had intended from the outset to prepare a collected works of Shakespeare, as seems likely, they might well have organized such a regular pattern of work to be adhered to from the beginning of the series to the end. It may at least be a hypothesis worth testing as further work is done on the other Pavier editions.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Cases and Compositors in the Shakespeare First Folio Comedies by Paul Werstine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much bibliographical research in the twentieth century has been devoted to identification of the type-setters who transmitted Shakespeare's plays from manuscript to print. Recent qualitative study of the compositors' work has justified the labour expended in compositor identification, since accuracy in transmission has been shown to vary widely from one workman to another. 1 Before Shakespeare's modern editors can further explore these qualitative differences, they must be convinced that identification of the compositors' stints in the plays is sound. Secure compositor identification, grounded on close analysis of a wide range of evidence, must logically precede qualitative analysis of the compositors' accuracy. Compositor identification in the Shakespeare First Folio has occupied scholars since 1920 when Thomas Satchell discovered two compositors at work on the Folio Macbeth . Yet Charlton Hinman's Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare of 1963 stands as the major contribution to the study. Hinman revolutionized compositor study when he plotted the recurrence, throughout the Folio, of individually distinctive types to identify the cases of type Jaggard's compositors used. 2 Often Hinman was able to associate individual compositors with specific cases of type: Compositor D usually set type from case z, Compositor B generally worked at case y, and Compositor A at case x. Founded on case evidence as well as spelling evidence, most of Hinman's compositor attributions have resisted convincing challenge for over fifteen years. Only in quires D-H of the Comedies was Hinman unsuccessful in identifying cases. Quires D-F, he was forced to conclude, were apparently printed concurrently with non-Folio matter, very probably Wilson's Christian Dictionary , according to type-batter evidence visible in both works (Hinman, II, 370-371). Types from wrought-off Folio pages of quires D-F were often distributed, according to Hinman, for use in Wilson's work, which was set from the same cases employed in Folio production. Pages of the Dictionary in turn furnished types to Folio pages. Such irregular distribution practices deprived the analytical bibliographer of intelligible patterns of type recurrence in the Folio and thus prevented case identification. Irregular distribution persisted during work on quires G and H, but here Hinman found no evidence of concurrent printing. Instead, in these two quires, according to Hinman, different compositors frequently distributed parts of the same pages or columns (II, 386, 390). Such distribution yielded patterns of type recurrence—especially in quire G—which were at odds with those Hinman had plotted throughout most of the Folio where only two cases were used. When type-recurrence evidence in quires G and H failed to meet the norms for such evidence Hinman had developed, he relinquished the problem of case identification in G and H to later investigators. However, before he abandoned the problem, he left a wealth of evidence and valuable direction to researchers. Without intensive study of Wilson's Christian Dictionary , not attempted here, no one can now expect to solve all the problems of Folio quires D-H, but Hinman's suggestions regarding distribution practices in quires G and H offer a basis for re-examining his type-recurrence evidence in these quires. Such a re-examination may also illuminate problems in surrounding quires. While scholars have yet to pursue Hinman's suggestions, bibliographical work on the Folio Comedies has proceeded in other directions. Although Andrew Cairncross's reassessment of Hinman's compositor identifications in the Folio has not won assent, 3 later investigations by T. H. Howard-Hill and John O'Connor have proved valuable. 4 Both these scholars were forced to rely only on spacing and spelling evidence to identify the compositors of quires D-H, but their skillful and conscientious analyses of this evidence strengthen the basis for study provided by Hinman. Together these scholars have confirmed Hinman's association of individual compositors with specific cases: between them, they have now identified all known z-case Folio pages as Compositor D's work. However, since spelling evidence in the problem quires of the Comedies is tricky, Howard-Hill and O'Connor still disagree on compositor attribution for some pages and columns. Re-examination of Hinman's typographical evidence made possible in part by their studies may resolve their disagreements.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quire H Compositors and Cases Quire H provides the point of departure for this study because here for the first time in five quires Hinman discerned a largely intelligible pattern of type recurrence, and here later scholars have achieved substantial, if not total, agreement regarding compositor identification. Hinman recognized two compositors, B and D, at work, as well as many indications "that all the non-B pages were set from one case . . . and that H4 v , H5, H6, and H6 v [Compositor B's pages] were set from a different case" (II, 390). Howard-Hill later detected Compositor C's work on H1, 1 v a, 2b, 2 v , 3a, and 4a; O'Connor agreed to these re-attributions but also gave H3 v and the last twenty lines of H5 v to Compositor C. Howard-Hill's discovery that three different compositors, B, C, and D, all worked on quire H introduces the possibility that the three may have worked from three different cases here, just as they did in quires N-Q (Hinman, II, 414-438). Without the knowledge that three compositors were at work, Hinman overlooked the possibility of three cases, but in his differentiation of Compositor B's case from the case used to set the non-B pages, Hinman provided the key to separating the cases used by B's fellow compositors. Hinman observed that in quire H Compositors B and D "commonly distributed type from the same wrought-off pages. As a rule they concerned themselves with different whole columns of those pages. As a rule but not always. Types from upper G6a reappear in H5 [B's page], a type from lower G6a goes to the forme-mate page [H2 v , now known to be the work of Compositor C]. . . . Distribution practices that are not ordinarily in evidence in most of the Folio, in short, are certainly in evidence here" (II, 390). In evaluating the possibility that each of the three quire-H compositors used a different case, we must entertain the second possibility that, not just Compositors B and D, but all three compositors may have shared distribution of the same pages and columns. Table I, a revised form of Hinman's graph for quire H, demonstrates that the quire was indeed set from three cases. 5 Since Hinman has already differentiated Compositor B's case from the others (II, 390-391), I shall concentrate only upon distinguishing from one another the cases used by Compositors C and D. For example, i) Column G5b provides types to Compositor D's columns H3b and H4b as well as to the disputed page H3 v (see lines 2, 3, 7.1, 8.2, 9.3, and 11.2 of Table I), but none to any page or column accepted by all scholars as set by Compositor C. Lower column G5a provides a type to each of Compositor C's page H2 v and column H4a (see lines 5 and 17 of Table I), but none to any page or column set by Compositor D and none to H3 v . However, upper column G5a does provide types to page H3 v (see lines 1.1 and 1.2 of Table I). Had all of page G5 been distributed into a single case from which both Compositors C and D worked, we might expect that at least one or two of the nine identifiable types in quire H drawn from column G5b and upper column G5a would recur in pages or columns set by Compositor C. None does recur. Yet the presence of types from lower G5a in Compositor C's work confirms and extends Hinman's observation that the compositors of quire H sometimes shared distribution of the same columns from wrought-off pages. The observation is extended further in many of the following examples. ii) Column G4b provides a type to each of Compositor D's columns H3b and H5 v a (see lines 8.2 and 23.2 of Table I), but to no page or column set by Compositor C; column G4a provides a type to each of Compositor C's column H3a and page H2 v (see lines 11.1 and 18 of Table I), but not to any column or page set by D and not to the disputed page H3 v . This evidence suggests that Compositor C distributed column G4a into one case, and Compositor D distributed column G4b into another. iii) Lower column G6b also furnishes types to Compositor D's H5 v a as well as to his column H2a (see lines 22 and 23.2 of Table I), but to no work set by Compositor C, although upper G6b furnishes a type to the disputed lower column H5 v b (see line 23.1) and lower G6a furnishes a type to Compositor C's page H2 v (see line 18). iv) Lower column H3a furnishes types to Compositor D's upper column H5 v b and column H1 v b (see lines 8.1 and 9.2), whereas only the middle of H3a furnishes a type to a column set by Compositor C, column H1 v a (line 9.1). v) Column G2b furnishes types to Compositor C's H2 v , H3a, and H4a (lines 5, 8.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10 and 18), but to no non-C page, nor to the disputed page H3 v . Column G2a furnishes types to H3b and H4b (lines 4 and 11.2), that is, to two columns set by D but to none by C. vi) Column G1 v b supplies types to Compositor C's H1, H3a, and H4a (lines 5, 7.2, 11.1, and 26), but to no work set by D, nor to H3 v . vii) Column H4b supplies types to Compositor C's H1 and H1 v a (lines 4 and 6), but not to Compositor D's H1 v b and not to H3 v . viii) Column H4 v a supplies types to Compositor C's H1 v a and H2b (lines 12 and 13), but none to Compositor D's columns on the same pages, H1 v b and H2a, and none to H3 v . Table I also shows that the upper parts of G2 v b (l. 10), G3 v b (l. 26), G5 v a (ll. 5 and 18), and H3 v b (l. 1.1), as well as all of G1b and H5b (ll. 18 and 19), supplied types only to Compositor C's undisputed pages and columns. Lower column G5 v a (l. 6) and all of G6 v , H3b, and H3 v a (ll. 1.2, 8.2, 9.3 and 23.2) supplied types only to Compositor D's undisputed pages and columns; the middle of G4 v b provided one type to Compositor D's H2a and another to disputed page H3 v (ll. 3 and 22); and the middle of G2 v b and lower G3a furnished types to H3 v alone. Thus type-recurrence evidence indicates that while Compositor C worked from one case, Compositor D worked from another. It further indicates that the disputed page H3 v was set from the case at which Compositor D set his portion of quire H. In order to accept such overwhelming type-recurrence evidence, we need admit only the assumption that the three compositors distributed different columns of the same pages and different parts of the same columns, the very assumption Hinman required in order to distinguish Compositor B's case from the single other case Hinman believed was in use during work on quire H. On the basis of type-recurrence evidence in quire H alone, it is not yet possible to identify any of the three cases as the familiar x, y, and z cases. Thus I have used the case designators r, s, and t in Table I. Case differentiation can be put to immediate use in resolving the dispute over compositor attributions for page H3 v and lower column H5 v b, assigned to Compositor D by Howard-Hill, to Compositor C by O'Connor. On H3 v , as O'Connor noted, "the traditional evidence of doe, goe, here/heere is inconclusive . . . because of the number of long lines requiring justification" ("Compositors D and F," p. 91). As a result, scholars have been forced to rely on ambiguous spelling and spacing evidence. In assigning H3 v to Compositor C, O'Connor could depend only on a single spaced terminal comma, a single indented two-line stage direction, three instances of you'll , and the contractions y e , and y u , and y t . These features are all characteristic of Compositor C but are also found in pages set by Compositor D or by Compositor F whose work is often difficult to distinguish from Compositor D's. For example, Compositor D's pages, like Compositor C's, sometimes contain spaced terminal commas: Q6, set from case z, has four. Compositor F set y u (D3) and you'll (B4 v , B5, E3) and indented a two-line stage direction (A5). In denying H3 v to Compositor D, O'Connor remarked on the absence of that compositor's preferential terminal - ie spellings, although in D's pages the ratio of- ie /- y spellings varies widely even for selected words: on N6 v the ratio is 3:1, but on L5 v it is 1:3 (O'Connor, 96). As O'Connor correctly acknowledged, "no piece of [the evidence for Compositor C] is conclusive by itself" (p. 91). With the demonstration above that H3 v was set from the case at which Compositor D stood during composition of quire H, there is no longer any need to deny him this page. Indeed the assignment of H3 v to Compositor D is confirmed by the page's thirty-six indented flow-overs cited by Howard-Hill in support of Hinman's original attribution of this page to Compositor D. 6 Case identification provides less decisive evidence for lower column H5 v b ( Err. , 1235-54). Whereas everyone has agreed to assign the rest of H5 v to Compositor D, O'Connor attributed the last twenty lines of H5 v b to Compositor C. These lines contain the spellings wee'll and gon , both strongly characteristic of Compositor C, according to O'Connor. The lines also contain one distinctive type, d24, last observed by Hinman in upper column G6b (see Table I, l. 23.1). Although four other distinctive types from G6b recur in Compositor D's pages of quire H (see Table I, ll. 22 and 23.2), all four come from lower G6b. Thus it is entirely possible that Compositor D distributed only the lower part of column G6b, while Compositor C distributed the upper part. If such is the case, Compositor C might well have set lower column H5 v b. On the basis of type-recurrence evidence alone, it is equally possible, however, that Compositor D distributed all of column G6b and set all of page H5 v . Only a combination of type-recurrence evidence with spelling evidence—a combination essential to compositor identification—makes it probable that Compositor C set lower column H5 v b. Distribution and Order It has already been observed that Compositors B, C, and D frequently distributed type from the same wrought-off pages and columns. Such distribution practices are "abnormal in terms of later practice" (Hinman, II, 391) in the Folio Histories and Tragedies. They are not abnormal, however, in the context of other quires in the Comedies, such as quires N and Q, where again three compositors worked from three cases. Type-recurrence evidence in quire H raises the same question about the relative order in which individual pages were set that Hinman addressed in his discussion of quire N: to what extent did different compositors work simultaneously on pages and formes? (II, 417) No forme in quire H was composed entirely by the same workman. Thus each forme provided an opportunity for simultaneous composition by at least two workmen and sometimes by all three. Probably the two pages of forme H2 v :5 were composed simultaneously, since each page was set by a Summary for Quire H 7 D distributed ----- and set H3 v ( C I, free) C" {G2b ( B I) {G5 v upper a ( F I) {G1 v b ( E I) " H4a D " {G2a(-) {G5 v lower a(-) and set H4b( B I) C " ----- " H3a D " ----- " H3b( D I) B " {G5 v b(-) {G1 v a(-) " H4 v ( E I) C " {G6 lower a and upper b( A I) {G1b( D I) " H2 v ( A I) B " {G6 upper a[] {Gla(-) " H5( G I) D " G6 lower b(-) " H2a C " H4 v a( E I) "H2b( F I) D " {G6 v [] {H3b( D I) {H3 lower a(-) " most of H5 v ( C I) C " ----- " H5 v lower b C " {H3 middle a(-) {H4b( B I) {H3 v upper b( C I) " H1 v a D " H3 v a(-) " H1 v b( E I) B " {H3 upper a(-) {H4 v b(-) {H4a(-) {H3 v lower b(-) " H6( B I) C " H5b( G I) " H1[] B " H5a(-) H2 v upper b[] " H6 v ( D I) different compositor from a different case according to normal Folio practice. The same is true of H1:6 v . The two columns of each of pages H4, 3, 2, and 1 v were also set from different cases by different compositors and thus may also have been composed simultaneously. Furthermore, page H3 may well have been set by Compositors C and D from cases r and s at the same time Compositor B set the forme-mate page H4 v from case t. The same may be true of forme H1 v :6, where Compositors C and D shared composition of page H1 v and Compositor B set page H6 alone. Yet the two pages of each of formes H3 v :4 and H2:5 v cannot have been composed at the same time, since, in each of these formes, Compositor D alone set a single page (or all but twenty lines of a single page in the case of H5 v ) as well as a column in the forme-mate. There is also strong evidence in quire H of simultaneous composition of different formes. For example, in the Cr column, H1 v a, is a type from the middle of H3a, and types from upper H3a reappear in Bt's page H6; yet a type from lower H3a is to be found in Ds's share of H5 v b. There can be but one adequate explanation: Compositors B and C must have begun distribution in preparing to set the fifth forme, H1 v :6, before Compositor D had completed distribution in preparation for setting H5 v in the fourth forme. Here is an instance of three compositors at work simultaneously on two successive formes. There are others. In the Bt page, H4 v , there first reappear types from G1 v a and G5 v b, but types from lower G5 v a are found in Ds's H4b and types from both upper G5 v a and G1 v b recur in Cr's H4a. Such evidence suggests that the three compositors were sharing distribution of G1 v and 5 v while Compositors C and D were preparing to set H4, but Compositor B was preparing to set a page in the next forme, H4 v . Centre-rule evidence also indicates simultaneous composition of successive formes. Centre rule D I was freed through distribution of page G1 in preparation for setting forme H2 v :5. Yet centre rule D I was used to impose a page in the preceding forme, H3. Preparation for composition of forme H2 v :5 therefore seems to have anticipated imposition of the earlier forme, H3:4 v . Thus type-recurrence and centre-rule evidence indicates three instances where the compositors worked on different formes at the same time—rare instances discovered later only in quires N-Q. Conflicting evidence is apparent in connection with the distribution of column G6b. Types from lower G6b first appear in Ds's columns H2a and H5 v a, but the single distinctive type from upper G6b does not reappear until lower H5 v b, the work of Cr. Thus it would seem that Compositor C distributed upper G6b in preparation for completing Ds's work on H5 v before Compositor D had begun work on H5 v —clearly an impossibility. The simplest explanation is that Compositor C distributed upper G6b at about the same time as he distributed lower G6a, that is, in preparing to set H2 v . Buried under types distributed from columns G1b and H4 v a and, as demonstrated above, the middle of column H3a, the single distinctive type from upper column G6b did not re-appear until Compositor C turned to finish Compositor D's page H5 v . While the production of quire H was abnormal by Folio standards, it need not be regarded as either haphazard or inefficient. This method of production must have proved useful, for it was repeated, in large part, in quire N where again there were the same three compositors at the same three cases available for work on the Folio. Another comparable example is to be found in quire G. Anomalous Types It is remarkable that three compositors often distributing type from the same pages and columns at the same time failed to produce in quire H even one anomalous appearance of a distinctive type. Instead it now becomes possible to explain two anomalous appearances of distinctive types recorded by Hinman. Upon discovering two distinctive types from upper H3a in Compositor B's H6 (p 27 and N22 in Table I, l. 10), Hinman concluded that "B's labours for H6 can hardly have been simultaneous with D's for H5 v and we cannot well suppose that Compositor D began his distributing of H3 at some point near the middle of H3a, leaving the first twenty-five lines or so standing for B to distribute later. How we can best account for the presence of types p27 and N22 in H6 is hard to say, but they evidently got into B's case in some irregular manner" (II, 392). With the discovery that quire H was set by three compositors working from three cases, often simultaneously on different formes, the appearance of these types need no longer be regarded as anomalous. Compositor B's "labours for H6" probably were simultaneous with D's for H5 v , just as, somewhat earlier, Compositor B's work on H4 v probably coincided with the work of Compositors C and D on H4.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quire G Compositors and Cases Hinman's analysis of the type-recurrence evidence in quire G failed to yield any case identifications. Perhaps as a result, there has been considerable disagreement among scholars about compositor attributions in quire G. The range of opinion is charted below: Hinman Howard-Hill O'Connor Werstine G1 D B/D B/C B/C/B G1 v D? B B B G2 A D/C F/C F/C G2 v B B B B G3 B B B B G3 v B B B B G4 D? C/F C/F C/F G4 v D? F/C F/C F/C G5 A C C C G5 v A F F F G6 A F/C F/C F/C G6 v A? C C F/C As the chart shows, Hinman and O'Connor found three different compositors in quire G, while Howard-Hill discovered four. This multiplicity of compositors again introduces the possibility that at least three cases may have been in use here as they were in work on quire H. The possibility is strengthened by Hinman's significant observation that in quire G, as in quire H, the same pages "were partly distributed into one case and partly into another" (II, 387). Table II, a revised form of Hinman's graph for quire G, presents evidence to confirm the possibility that quire G was set from three cases. 8 Compositor B Hinman convincingly attributed pages G2 v , 3, and 3 v to Compositor B on the basis of the high frequency of do, go, heere , and Isa . spellings in these pages (I, 407-408). Confirming Hinman's attributions, Howard-Hill pointed to evidence in these pages of Compositor B's use of unitalicized forms of Duke, Prouost , and Friar , the speech prefix Duke . and spaced medial commas. This broader range of evidence also permitted both Howard-Hill and O'Connor to assign page G1 v and column G1a to Compositor B, but not column G1b. Although column G1b contains one do spelling, eight unitalicized forms of Duke , and a preponderance of Duke . speech headings, it also has two goe spellings in short lines, a doe spelling in a long line that perhaps required spelling adjustment for justification, and four Frier spellings, three of them italicized. This conflicting evidence led Howard-Hill to assign the column to Compositor D, while O'Connor preferred Compositor C. Further analysis of the spelling patterns in the column resolves the disagreement. All the spelling evidence on G1b that conflicts with Compositor B's habits occurs in the first twenty-two lines of the column: doe (l. 17j), goe twice (l. 5), Frier italicized (ll. 2-3, 6, 18) and Frier unitalicized (l. 22). The last forty-four lines contain such abundant evidence of Compositor B's hand that they must be assigned to him: the speech prefix Duke . eight times, the unitalicized form of Duke six times, and the spelling do in a short line. Attribution of lower column G1b to Compositor B is confirmed by type-recurrence evidence provided by Hinman. This evidence shows that all the pages and columns attributed to Compositor B on the grounds of spelling were set from the same case—all, that is, except G3 v for which no reliable type-recurrence evidence is available. For example, i) Lower column F6a furnishes a distinctive type to each of Compositor B's pages G2 v and G3 (see Table II, ll. 6 and 12), but to no other page or column, although upper column F6a furnishes a distinctive type to each of columns G4 v a and G2a (see Table II, ll. 9.1 and 15.1). ii) Column F6b supplies types to Compositor B's page G2 v and to his column G1a, as well as to lower column G1b, just assigned to Compositor B (see Table II, ll. 11 and 18), but to no pages or columns not set by B. iii) Column G3 v a also provides types to Compositor B's G1a and lower column G1b and to his page G1 v (see Table II, ll. 1 and 2), but provides none to pages and columns set by other compositors. Compositor B must also have distributed column F5 v a (see Table II, ll. 6 and 7.1), lower F5 v b (l. 8), F6 v a (ll. 11 and 12), middle G3 v b (l. 1), middle G3a and all G3b (ll. 6 and 7.1), G2 v a and lower G2 v b (l. 11), for types from these columns also appear only on pages G3, 2 v , 1 v , column G1a and lower column G1b, with the single anomalous exception noted below. At this point in our analysis of type recurrences, there is but the slightest evidence that Compositor B stood at the same case for quire G that he used for quire H—that is, case t. Column G3b, which supplied distinctive types to Compositor B's page G1 v and column G1a, also supplied a distinctive type to his page H6 v (see Table I, l. 27). Yet the identification of case t in quire G will be confirmed repeatedly by recurrences found in the later quires I, M and N of types observed last in pages distributed by Compositor B to set quire G. Compositor C Hinman attributed to Compositors A and D the pages in quire G not set by Compositor B, but he acknowledged that the "spelling peculiarities in this quire are often far from conclusive" (II, 386). Howard-Hill and O'Connor have since agreed to assign G2b, 4a, 4 v b, 5, 6b, and 6 v to Compositor C. Evident in these pages and columns are C's characteristic spellings doe and goe , the speech prefixes Isab . and Duke. , unitalicized forms of Prouost, Duke and Frier , and spaced medial and terminal commas. Based on this evidence (charted below), these attributions to Compositor C cannot be challenged except in the case of G6 v , a part-page which contains the last twenty-two lines of the text of MM and "The names of all the Actors." There is, of course, some evidence of Compositor C's work on this part-page: two Duke. speech prefixes in the first column and, especially, the contraction wee'll in the second last line of the text in the second column. Although it is unlikely that any compositor but Compositor C would have set wee'll , it is equally unlikely that Compositor C set all of G6 v , for the text in the first column contains the spelling here (in herein ) and the second line of the second column includes an italicized form of Prouost , a word Compositor C never set in italics in quire G. It would appear then that Compositor C merely finished composition of G6 v , setting the last few lines of the second column of text and, perhaps, "The names of all the Actors" as well. Part-page G6 v belongs to the same forme as page G1, the second column of which, as already noticed, has been assigned to Compositor C by O'Connor. Although, as I have shown, the lower part of the column was Compositor B's, there is still much evidence to support attribution of upper column G1b to Compositor C: the spellings doe , in a long line, and goe , twice in short lines, the speech prefix Duke. in short lines, as well as two unitalicized forms of Duke/s and one of Frier . Here is enough to outweigh the three italicized forms of Frier in upper G1b, forms uncharacteristic of Compositor C who italicized Frier but one other time in quire G. It is difficult to say, however, precisely where Compositor C left off composition of G1b to allow Compositor B to finish the column. The last spelling in the column peculiar to Compositor C is Frier in l. 22, but the first distinctive type indicative of Compositor B's case is not found until l. 40. Thus Compositor C may have set as few as twenty-two lines or as many as thirty-nine lines of column G1b. Type-recurrence evidence confirms that all the pages and columns now attributed to Compositor C were set from the same case, except for G6b, upper G1b and lower G6 v b. With one anomalous exception, the distinctive types in G6b all come from column G4 v b, which furnishes distinctive types to no other Folio page or column. The single distinctive type in upper G1b was last seen by Hinman in upper column G3a, which also provides no distinctive types to other Folio pages. Lower G6 v b contains no distinctive types. Attribution of G6b, upper G1b, and lower G6 v b to Compositor C must rest on spelling evidence alone. Type-recurrence evidence demonstrates the integrity of the case from which Compositor C set the remainder of his output in quire G: i) Lower column F2a supplies distinctive types to Compositor C's page G5 and his columns G4a and G4 v b (see Table II, ll. 4.1, 5.1, 9.2, 10, and 14), but to no other pages or columns, although the upper four lines of F2a supply one distinctive type to G4 v a (see Table II, l. 9.1). ii) Column F1 v b also supplies a distintive type to each of Compositor C's column G4 v b and page G5, as well as another to his column G2b (see Table II, ll. 9.2, 14, and 15.2), but to no other columns or pages. Compositor C also distributed the middle of column F5 v b (see Table II, ll. 4.1 and 14), column F6 v b (l. 14) and column G4a (l. 4.1), since distinctive types from these columns also recur on page G5 and columns G4 v b and G2b. Like Compositor B, Compositor C set his stint on quire G from the same case he used for his pages of quire H: G4a, which supplies distinctive types to Compositor C's column G2b, also supplies a distinctive type to his page H2 v and another to his column H3a (see Table I, ll. 11.1 and 18). Additional type-recurrence evidence from quire H has already indicated that Compositor C distributed the upper parts of columns G2 v b and G3 v b. Distinctive types from these partial columns re-appear in Compositor C's column H3a and his page H1 (see Table I, ll. 10 and 26), although no distinctive type from upper G2 v b or upper G3 v b recurs in pages of quire G. Compositor F The remaining pages and columns of quire G were assigned by Hinman to Compositors A and D, but have since been re-assigned by O'Connor and Howard-Hill to Compositor F alone. The single exception is column G2a, assigned by Hinman and O'Connor to Compositor A(F) and by Howard-Hill to Compositor D. While this disagreement over column G2a is indicative of the difficulty encountered by scholars in distinguishing between Compositors D and F, this problem need not delay us here. It is sufficient to note that the highly consistent spelling pattern in the remaining pages of quire G (charted below) indicates the presence of just one more compositor. Following O'Connor and Howard-Hill, I have called this workman Compositor F. These scholars have shown that, unlike Compositor B, Compositor F of quire G used the spellings doe, goe and here , italicized forms of Duke, Prouost , and Frier , the speech prefixes Duk. and Isab. and non-spaced medial commas. The italicized forms, the speech prefix Duk. and the infrequency of spaced terminal commas on Compositor F's pages are useful in separating him from Compositor C. Only the division of part-page G6 v requires additional comment. Recurrence, in column G6 v a, of two distinctive types last seen in column G5b (distributed into Compositor F's case s), the spelling here (in herein ) also in G6 v a, and the italicized form of Prouost in the second line of column G6 v b all demonstrate that Compositor F set all of G6 v a and began G6 v b. Exactly where he left off composition of G6 v b so that Compositor C could finish the column is difficult to say. The last distinctive indication of Compositor F's hand occurs in the second of the eleven lines in column G6 v b, the first distinctive indication of Compositor C's hand in the second last line. Thus Compositor F may have set as many as twenty lines of text on G6 v or as few as thirteen lines. Type-recurrence evidence shows that all pages and columns attributed to Compositor F were set from a single case, with the exception of column G6a for which no evidence is available. Column G6a takes its three distinctive types from column G4 v a, a column which provides identifiable types to no other Folio page or column. Attribution of column G6a to Compositor F thus must depend on spelling and spacing evidence alone. Such evidence has proved convincing to Howard-Hill and O'Connor who have agreed to assign the column to Compositor F. The integrity of the case from which Compositor F set the rest of his stint is readily demonstrable: i) Column F1 v a supplies a distinctive type to each of Compositor F's column G4 v a and page G5 v (see Table II, ll. 9.1 and 16), but none to any other column or page. ii) Upper column F6a provides a distinctive type again to Compositor F's column G4 v a, as well as another to the same compositor's column G2a (see Table II, ll. 9.1 and 15.1), but to no other pages or columns, although lower column F6a does provide distinctive types to Compositor B's pages G2 v and G3, as already noted. iii) Column G4b also provides two distinctive types to Compositor F's column G2a (see Table II, l. 4.2), but none to any other page or column in quire G. However, as observed earlier, column G4b also furnishes identifiable types to two columns set by Compositor D in quire H (see Table I, ll. 8.2 and 23.2). Therefore Compositor F's columns G2a and G4 v a and his page G5 v must have been set from the same case Compositor D used in his work on quire H, that is, case s. iv) Alone of the columns in quire G, Compositor F's column G4b takes a distinctive type from upper column F5 v b (see Table II, l. 5.2), which also supplies a distinctive type (Hinman's h4o) to Compositor D's column H4b set from case s. Thus column G4b too must have been set from case s. v) Finally, Compositor F's column G6 v a takes both its identifiable types from column G5b (see Table II, l. 13), a column which provides distinctive types to no other column or page in quire G, but which supplies eight identifiable types to columns and pages in quire H set from case s by Compositor D (see Table I, ll. 2, 3, 7.1, 8.2, 9.3, and 11.2). Therefore column G6 v a, like Compositor F's G4b, G4 v a, G2a, and G5 v , was also set from case s. Into case s were also distributed page F1 (see Table II, l. 16), upper column F2a (l. 9.1), and column F2b (ll. 4.2 and 5.2). According to type-recurrence evidence observed in quire H, distribution of lower column G3a, upper column G4 v b, and the middle of column G2 v b also fell to Compositor F at case s, for distinctive types from these three partial columns are to be found again in the pages of quire H set from case s (see Table I, ll. 3 and 22). To account for all the distribution into case s during work on quire G, we must finally look as far ahead as quire I, where, in I3 v , there reappears an identifiable type from lower G3 v b. When I3 v is also shown to have been set from case s, we may then confirm that lower G3 v b, too, was distributed into that case as Compositor F worked on quire G. Distribution and Order Summary for Quire G B distributed ----- and set G3 v ( E I, free) C " {most of F2a ( A I) {F5 v middle b ( F I) " G4a F " {F2b and upper a (-) {F5 v upper b (-) " G4b( F I) B " {F5 v a and lower b (-) {F6 lower a and b ( B I) " G3( A I) F " {F6 upper a (-) {F1 v a ( D I) " G4 v a C " F1 v b (-) " G4 v b( B I) B " F6 v a ( C I) " G2 v ( C I) C " F6 v b (-) " G5( D I) F " F1 [] " G5 v ( F I) F " G4b ( F I) " G2a C " G4a (-) " G2b ( B I) B " {G3 v a and middle b( E I) {G3b and middle a ( A I) " G1 v ( E I) F " {G3 lower a (-) {G4 v a and middle b ( B I) {G3 v lower b (-) " G6a C " {G4 v upper and lower b (-) {G3 upper a (-) {G3 v upper b (-) " G6b( A I) B " G2 v a and lower b ( C I) " most of G1 ( D I) C " ----- " G1 upper b F " G5b ( D I) " G6 v a, upper b C " ----- " G6 v lower b and "The names of all the Actors" In quire G, Compositors B, C, and F co-operated in the distribution of the same wrought-off pages and columns, much as the three compositors of quire H did. Such abnormal distribution practices again raise questions about the relative order in which pages and formes were set and the extent to which different compositors worked simultaneously on different columns, pages and formes. Since none of the formes of quire G was the work of a single compositor, there was much opportunity for simultaneous composition sometimes by two workmen, sometimes by three. The two pages of forme G2 v :5 may have been composed simultaneously, for each page was set by a different compositor from a different case, according to normal Folio practice. The two compositors who set G2 v :5 shared distribution of page F6 v and therefore were likely at work at the same time. Simultaneous composition of the pages of G1:6 v is also probable for the same reasons, but with the minor variation that for a short time Compositor C aided Compositors B and F in setting both of the pages. However, the pages of forme G2:5 v cannot have been set simultaneously. A single compositor, Compositor F, set both G2a and G5 v from the same case. The columns of each of pages G4, 4 v , 2, and 6 may have been composed at the same time: one column of each page was set by Compositor C from case r, the other by Compositor F from case s. Evidence that Compositors C and F shared distribution of the same wrought-off pages and columns in preparation for setting each of these four pages suggests they did indeed work on the pages simultaneously. Shared distribution of columns and pages also points to simultaneous composition of forme G1 v :6 by three compositors. Simultaneous composition of successive formes is a possibility in quire G, but not so strong a possibility as it was in quire H. Compositors B, C, and F each had a hand in the distribution of column F5 v b. However, Compositors C and F were preparing to set page G4 of the first forme by distributing upper and middle F5 v b, while Compositor B was readying his case to set page G3 of the second forme by distributing lower F5 v b. Thus composition of the first two formes may have proceeded simultaneously, but such a conclusion is not inescapable. Perhaps Compositors C and F merely left lower F5 v b for later distribution by Compositor B. Of the method of production of quires F and G, Howard-Hill wrote: "The picture that this division of work presents of activities in Jaggard's printing-house is most unusual. It is scarcely to be conceived that the Folio would ever have been published had this been the ordinary method of working. . . . The irregular distribution of these quires arose, I suggest, not because Compositor D's practice was irregular (as Hinman thought) but because the division of setting amongst four compositors working from two cases led to unusual practices" (p. 80). The foregoing analysis has indicated that composition of quire G, at least, was divided amongst three different compositors, each at a separate case. Therefore activities in Jaggard's printing-house appear much less chaotic than Howard-Hill asserted. Instead, comparison of the methods used to produce quire G with those used to produce quire H suggests that a routine had been developed for setting by three compositors. In both quires, a single compositor set a whole page of each of the first two formes, while two compositors co-operated to set the forme-mates. Then Compositors B and C each set a full page in the third forme. Three columns of the fourth forme (almost three in quire H) were set by Compositor D in quire H and by Compositor F in quire G; the fourth column was, in each case, the work of Compositor C. The fifth forme in each quire was composed in exactly the same manner as the second forme, with Compositor B setting a full page of each forme and his fellow compositors sharing the forme-mate. Variations in the setting of the sixth formes of quires G and H may well have arisen because page G6 v , unlike page H6 v , is but a part-page. Thus the three compositors of quire G divided their labours in very nearly the same manner as the three compositors of quire H—not according to the "normal routine" that prevailed in the later two-case setting of the Histories and Tragedies, but in an orderly manner nevertheless. Anomalous Types Of anomalous appearances of distinctive types in the pages of quire G, Hinman wrote: "The distribution of most of the pages of quire F having been irregular, it is impossible to say which quire-F types, if any, appear anomalously in quire G. None of the types that are found in any two quire-G pages appears anomalously in the later of those pages" (II, 387). Re-examination of Hinman's type-recurrence evidence (exclusive of the first three formes of quire F distributed during work on quire F) reveals just one anomalous appearance of a distinctive type from quire F in quire G. Distinctive type p39 (see Table II, l. 17) is common to both F5 v a63 (distributed into Bt) and G6b53 (set by Cr). This single anomalous appearance of a distinctive type, of course, has no significance for the argument that Compositors C and F used different cases to set their portions of quire G, nor is one anomalous type sufficient evidence to question the use of separate cases by Compositors B and C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quire I Compositors and Cases Hinman identified two compositors at work on quire I, Compositor A, perhaps, or C at case x, and Compositor B at case y. Howard-Hill then assigned the six and a half pages set, according to Hinman, from case x (I3 v -5a, 5 v -6 v ) to Compositor C, but Howard-Hill's re-assignment was modified by O'Connor who offered a strong argument that page I3 v was Compositor D's. Again Compositor B presents the fewest problems. Hinman demonstrated the integrity of case y, the case used by Compositor B to set pages I1-3 and column I5b (II, 396). It is sufficient here to indicate evidence presented in Hinman's graph for quire I that shows Compositor B must have stood at the same case, case y, when he set his stints on quires G and H. Such evidence consists of the recurrence (in quire-I pages set by By) of distinctive types Compositor B distributed in preparation for setting his portions of quires G and H. The By page I3 contains one distinctive type from each of columns G3b and G3 v a (see Hinman, II, 394, l. 8), both distributed by Compositor B into case t during his work on quire G. The By pages I3 and I1 v and the By column I5b reveal distinctive types last seen in upper column G6a, lower column H3 v b, and columns H2 v b, H4a, and H4 v b (see Hinman, II, 394, ll. 8, 12, 17 and 23), all distributed by Compositor B into case t during his stint on quire H. These seven type recurrences demonstrate the simple equation that case t, Compositor B's case for quires G and H, is the familiar case y at which Compositor B generally worked throughout the setting of the Folio. The same kind of evidence indicates that case r, used by Compositor C to set his pages of quires G and H, was the familiar case x occupied by Compositor C for quire I. The Cx pages I4 v and I6 v contain single distinctive types last observed in lower column F2a and column F1 v b (see Hinman II, 394, ll. 10 and 21), both distributed by Compositor C into case r during composition of quire G. The Cx pages I4, I4 v , I5 v , and I6 take distinctive types from columns G1b and H5b and the middle of column H3a (see Hinman, II, 394, ll. 4, 10, 15, 16, and 18), all distributed by Compositor C into case r during the setting of quire H. Re-examination of Hinman's type-recurrence evidence thus not only demonstrates that Compositor C's case r is indeed case x, but also confirms attribution of pages I4, 4 v , and 5 v -6 v to Compositor C by identifying these pages as set from the case long occupied by that workman. No type recurrences can establish that the disputed page I3 v was also set from case x. This page contains ten identifiable types. Three of these were last seen in columns distributed by Compositor D into case s during the setting of quire H: sh26 in H3a55, u22 in H3b3, and sh23 in H3 v a32. Five more are taken from hitherto undistributed column H2 v a; 9 yet this column provides no distinctive types to Compositor C's page I4, forme-mate to I3 v , and none to any other pages of quire I set by Compositor C. Thus type recurrence provides strong evidence that page I3 v was not set from case x, but from case s, the case used by Compositor D for quire H. O'Connor's attribution of page I3 v to Compositor D is thus confirmed. Anomalous Types Four anomalous appearances of distinctive types must be recorded. Distinctive type y28 is common to I5 v a5 (set by Cx) and H3b56 (distributed by Ds during composition of quire H); distinctive type h24 is common to I4 v a21 (set by Cx) and H3a62 (distributed by Ds again during work on quire H). In the wrought-off material, neither type occupied a peripheral position, nor was either one adjacent to a centre rule. Thus neither one was likely vulnerable to a stripping accident. 10 Even so, these two anomalous appearances can scarcely outweigh the seventeen regular appearances of distinctive types already noted in the Ds and Cx pages of quire I. Were the three-case hypothesis for quires G-I seriously in error, we might expect to find a much lower proportion of type recurrences explained by it. A third apparently anomalous appearance of a distinctive type in fact provides further evidence for the three-case hypothesis. The Ds page I3 v contains distinctive type D23, last seen in column G3 v b, a column which supplied types to the Cx page H1 and the By page G1 v (see Table II, l. 1 and Table I, l. 26). However, the distinctive type in Cx's page H1 is from G3 v b6 in the upper part of the column, the distinctive types in By's page G1 v are from G3 v b23-39 in the middle part of the column, and the distinctive type in Ds's page I3 v is from G3 v b52 in the lower part of the column. Therefore three compositors in all likelihood shared the distribution of column G3 v b, as they shared distribution of other columns of quires F, G, and H. The fourth anomalous appearance was noted by Hinman: "The type represented in line 19 of the graph is G34. It is common to H5a22 (distributed into case y) and I5 v b5 (set by Ax [that is, Cx]). It is immediately adjacent to the left-hand rule in page H5, and hence in a peripheral position there" (II, 397).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quires K-Q Compositors and Cases In these seven quires, Hinman discovered four different compositors occupying three different cases. Compositor B alone used case y; Compositor C used case x, although, according to Hinman, so did Compositor A in quire K; and Compositor D alone used case z, except during composition of quires O and P, where Hinman found Compositor A standing at case z. Subsequent research has established a higher correlation between individual compositors and cases. Howard-Hill re-assigned Compositor A's quire-K pages to Compositor C so that Compositor C is now recognized as the only workman to use case x during composition of these seven quires, with the single exception of column K5b, set by Compositor B from case x, according to Howard-Hill. Howard-Hill also re-assigned Compositor A's quire-O pages, set from case z, to Compositor D, thereby strengthening the association between Compositor D and case z. At the same time, however, Howard-Hill weakened this association when he attributed the z-case pages of quire P to Compositor F and gave Compositor D column P1 v a, set from case x. Most of these anomalies in Howard-Hill's analysis were resolved by O'Connor, who assigned the disputed z-case pages of quire P to Compositor D and demonstrated that only lower column P1 v a was Compositor D's work and was set from case z. After the cumulative efforts of Hinman, Howard-Hill, and O'Connor, we now know that, with the exception of a single column (K5b), Compositor B alone used case y, Compositor C case x, and Compositor D case z for quires K-Q. 11 There is now general agreement that Compositor A was not represented in these quires. In these seven quires there recur a significant number of distinctive types last seen in quires F-H. These recurrences (charted below) confirm that the same pattern of three distinct cases of type associated with three individual compositors is also evident in the composition of quires G, H and I. 12 Twelve Hinman's distinctive type last seen then distributed into case location of recurrence in quires K-Q set from case 1. y24 H5 v a22 Cx K3b59 Cx 2. h45 H2a65 Cx K4 v a32 Cx 3. o26 H2a57 Cx K4 v a33 Cx 4.

Since all but one of these (no. 12) were last seen in material already identified as distributed by Compositor C, these type recurrences support the conclusion that Compositor C used case x for his stints on quires G and H and forme I3 v :4. Compositor B's use of case y during the setting of these earlier quires is also confirmed again by the recurrence of the next four charted types (no.'s 13-16) in his pages of quires K-Q, all four from wrought-off columns he distributed to set pages of quires G and H. The remaining six types charted (no.'s 17-22) re-appear in pages set from case z by Compositor D. Hinman was forced to regard all six recurrences as anomalous because he argued that Compositor D's case z was not set up until composition of quire K had begun (II, 400). Yet four of these distinctive types were last seen in pages, columns, and partial columns already identified as distributed by Compositors D or F into case s. The reappearance of these four types in quire-K and quire-L pages set from case z establishes that case s was the case Hinman designated case z. Therefore case z was not set up de novo during work on quire K, but was instead the case from which Compositors D and F set pages of quires G, H and I. Anomalous Types Three anomalous appearances are listed among the types charted (no.'s 12, 21 and 22). I can discover no explanation for the anomalous appearance of numbers 12 and 22, but the third, no. 21, can be readily explained. Distinctive type Y21 (no. 21) is found in the lower part of column H2 v b at l. 36 and found again in the Dz page K5 v . Since column H2 v b supplied three distinctive types to By pages, distribution of column H2 v b is assigned to Compositor B in the chart. The three distinctive types mentioned are h44, common to H2 v b32 and H6 v a44; e27, common to H2 v b29 and I5b11; and o38, common to H2 v b66 and I2b11. Only the last of these three distinctive types is evidence that Compositor B distributed the lower part of column H2 v b, but it is not good evidence because it was located in the last line of the wrought-off column H2 v b where it would have been especially vulnerable to a stripping accident. More probably, therefore, Compositor B distributed only the upper part of column H2 v b, including ll. 29 and 32, while Compositor D distributed the lower part of the column, including l. 36 where Y21 was last seen before it recurred in the Dz page K5 v . The recurrence of Y21 is probably not anomalous but instead becomes further evidence of Compositor D's use of case z during the setting of quire H. In summary, the three-case hypothesis for quires G-I explains all but two of the distinctive type recurrences charted (no.'s 12 and 22), whereas Hinman's two-case theory for quires G-I failed to explain six of these recurrences (no.'s 17-22).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quires A-F Thus far this article has concentrated on quires G-I; evidence has been drawn from quires K-Q only to confirm the three-case hypothesis as it applies to quires G-I. There is no need to search beyond quire Q for evidence of the three-case pattern, for during composition of quire R cases x and z were liquidated (Hinman, II, 441). However, study of the composition of quires G-I has implications for an understanding of work on the first six quires of the Folio, quires A-F. Since case z was not set up de novo during the setting of quire K, as Hinman believed, but was already in use for quire G, there remains a question about when case z was set up. In dealing with this question, we cannot rely as much on the kind of type-recurrence evidence used heretofore in case and compositor identification. Almost midway through the first six quires of the Comedies section—just after composition of page D4 v , to be precise—type recurrence no longer yields patterns useful for case identification. Such patterns do not emerge again until quire G. In spite of this breakdown in type-recurrence evidence for quires D through F, one fact is evident: case z was not set up de novo for composition of quire G, but was already in use before work on this quire began. The pages and columns of quires G through Q set from case z contain no fewer than nine distinctive types last seen in pages of quires C, E, and F which were distributed before Jaggard's compositors turned to quire G. 13 If it is granted that so many appearances of distinctive types cannot all be dismissed as anomalous, we must search for evidence of the use of case z in Folio quires set before quire G. The search is frustrated to some extent by the hiatus in intelligible type-recurrence evidence that extends from quire D to quire F. Since study of the type recurrences in these quires has yielded no case identifications, there must remain a theoretical possibility that case z may have been set up de novo at any point during composition of these Folio quires or during composition of non-Folio material that was being printed concurrently with these Folio quires—probably Wilson's Christian Dictionary , according to type-batter evidence Hinman discovered in both works. Although such uncertainty cannot be entirely dismissed, there are, however, intelligible patterns of type-recurrence evidence in quires A-D4 v that bear on the question about when case z was set up. According to Hinman, quires A-D4 v (in printing order) were set from only two cases. Compositor B set pages of the first four formes of quire A from case y and then, according to Hinman, yielded the case to Compositor C who worked on pages of the last two formes of quire A, as well as pages of quires B, C, and D. Both compositors were aided by Compositor A (now called F) who stood at a second case designated case x by Hinman. 14 Hinman's argument for this interpretation of the available evidence can be divided into two stages, the first successful, the second unsuccessful. In the first stage he used type-recurrence evidence to differentiate the case used by Compositor A(F) in quires A-D4 v from the single other case Hinman thought was used first by Compositor B and then by Compositor C. Hinman found a pattern of 116 distinctive-type appearances in quire A, none of which is rendered anomalous by his two-case hypothesis for the quire (Hinman, II, 351). Quire B offers another 162 appearances, only two of which Hinman was forced to dismiss as anomalous. The first distinctive type to recur anomalously is u23, common to A4b48 (distributed by By) and to B5 v b61 (set by A[F]); the second is distinctive type B30, common to A1 v a10 (distributed by By) and to B4 v b42 (set by A[F]), but this distinctive type appears, in the earlier of the two pages, immediately adjacent to the centre rule where it would be vulnerable to a stripping accident (II, 358). Since these anomalous appearances scarcely constitute grounds for challenging Hinman's two-case hypothesis for quire B and since Hinman drew equally impressive evidence from quire C (II, 360- 364) and the first two formes of quire D (II, 366-371), there can be little doubt that at least two cases, Compositor A(F)'s case x and Compositor B and Compositor C's case y, were employed to set Folio quires A-D4 v . Hinman was, in my view, much less successful in the second stage of his argument when he attempted to demonstrate that only two cases, and not three, were used in quires A-D4 v , that is, when he argued that the case used by Compositor C to finish quire A and to compose pages of quires B-D4 v was the same case used by Compositor B to set pages of the first four formes of quire A. The only support for this stage of Hinman's argument can be found in the recurrence of just two distinctive types common to quire-A pages distributed by Compositor B into case y and to pages set by Compositor C in quires A and B. 15 Distinctive type h30 is common to A6 v a53 (distributed by By) and to B2 v a33 (set by C); distinctive type W22 is common to A4b6 (distributed by By) and to A2b45 (set by C). Since W22 is, in the earlier of the two pages, immediately adjacent to the centre rule where it would be especially vulnerable to a stripping accident, Hinman's identification of Compositor C's case for quires A-D4 v as case y depends entirely on the recurrence of a single distinctive type distributed from a non-peripheral position. It will be recalled that Hinman dismissed as anomalous the recurrence, in a quire-B page set by Compositor A(F), of a single distinctive type (u23) which had been distributed from a non-peripheral position into case y by Compositor B during composition of quire A. By analogy, it would also be necessary to dismiss as anomalous the recurrence, in a quire-B page set by Compositor C, of this single distinctive type (h30), which had been distributed in exactly the same way by Compositor B. 16 Dismissing the recurrence of h30 as anomalous, in turn, entails rejecting Hinman's argument that Compositor C succeeded Compositor B at case y. It would then follow that Compositor C stood at a third case to set his stints on quires A-D4 v . Thus from the beginning of Folio production with quire A, three cases—not two—were used by the Folio compositors. Since type-recurrence evidence breaks down in quire D and does not again become useful until quire G, it is impossible to be certain whether the three cases used to set quire A (two of which, as Hinman was able to demonstrate in the first stage of his argument, remained in use for quires B-D4 v ) were the same three cases used for quires G-Q. I thus merely follow Hinman's example in using the same case designators for quires A-D4 v as for quires G-Q: Compositor B at case y worked on seven of the first eight pages of quire A; Compositor C at case x (now differentiated from case y) set two of the last four quire-A pages and pages of quires B-D4 v ; and Compositor A(F) at case z (which Hinman called case x) aided both the other compositors in succession. Thus far differentiation of Compositor C's case, now called case x, from Compositor B's case y has proceeded in entirely negative terms; Hinman's failure to demonstrate that Compositor C used case y indicates that Compositor C used a separate case. Yet it is also possible to differentiate the two cases, x and y, in positive terms on the basis of type-recurrence evidence. Setting aside the two anomalous type recurrences (h30 and W22) already discussed, we can observe that pages A1, 6 v , 1 v , 6, and 4 supply some thirty-six distinctive types to quire-A pages set by Compositor B (see Hinman, II, 344, ll. 1-5, 7-11, 15, 16), but none to any page set by Compositor C; pages A3, 3 v , and 2 v and column A2b supply some thirty-seven distinctive types to pages of quires A, B and C set by Compositor C (see Hinman, II, 344, ll. 1, 7, 11, 13, 17; 352, ll. 7, 8, 17, 20-22; 360, ll. 1, 3, 5, 29, 31; and I,480), but none to quire-A pages set by Compositor B. Therefore seventy-three type recurrences demonstrate that while Compositor B worked from case y for quire A, Compositor C worked from his own case, case x. Type-recurrence evidence also indicates when, after quire A, case y next supplied types for Folio composition. In the five pages Compositor B distributed during his labours in quire A, there are forty-four appearances of distinctive types. As already noted, in thirty-six of these possible forty-four instances, the distinctive types distributed into case y re-appear in the y-case pages of quire A set by Compositor B; four more identifiable types, as we have seen, recur anomalously in pages of quires A and B set from the two other cases, x and z, by Compositors C and A(F); and one (A31) is never found again in the Folio. The three remaining distinctive types do recur in the Folio, but are not to be seen until quire F, two in column F4b, one in column F5a (see Hinman, II, 376, ll. 6 and 19). 17 The extended delay in the recurrence of these three distinctive types deserves emphasis. In contrast, recurrences of the seventy-two distinctive types distributed into cases x and z from wrought-off pages of quire A by Compositors C and A(F) can all be located in quires A-D, with the exception of four distinctive types which do not recur at all in the Folio. (There are twenty-four recurrences in quire A, thirty-three in quire B, nine in quire C, and just two in quire D.) There can, then, be just one explanation for the long delay in the recurrence of the three distinctive types mentioned: case y, unlike cases x and z, was not used again for Folio composition until long after Compositor B had completed his work on quire A. Therefore Compositor C could not have used case y for his work in quires A-D4 v , but instead must have used a separate case, case x. At the same time, Compositor A(F) used a third case, case z, to set his stints for quires A-D4 v . The third case, case z, was therefore set up de novo at no point in Folio production, but was in use from the beginning. To summarize: from the outset Jaggard's printing of the First Folio seems to have demanded the labours of three compositors, each standing at a separate case. Compositor B occupied case y, Compositor C case x, and Compositor F case z. Yet all three men never worked simultaneously on the Folio during composition of the first five quires (A-E). Sometimes a single compositor worked alone or sometimes a pair of compositors shared a forme of the Folio, probably because, as Hinman observed, Jaggard's shop still had composition of Wilson's Christian Dictionary in hand. This pattern of composition remained unchanged even after Compositor D had succeeded Compositor F with the beginning of work on quire F (Howard-Hill, pp. 78-82; O'Connor, pp. 101-110). By the middle of Folio quire F, however, Wilson's volume apparently no longer drew upon the time of Jaggard's compositors or the stock of types in their cases, and three workmen—Compositors B, C, and D—began to devote their time exclusively to the Folio. This new pattern of composition by three type-setters was to continue until work on quire I began, even though Compositor F took over from Compositor D again for quire G, only to be displaced again immediately after this quire by Compositor D who then occupied case z until it was liquidated for composition of quire R. When three compositors—B, C, and F—distributed types from the last half of quire F in order to set G, their work produced clear patterns of type recurrence so that their cases can be identified with some confidence for the first time since early in the composition of Folio quire D. These type-recurrence patterns indicate that complex distribution practices persisted throughout composition of quires G and H, with different compositors often co-operating to distribute types from the same wrought-off pages and columns. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the availability of three compositors and cases sowed confusion in the production of the Folio. Instead, the compositors followed essentially the same routine in dividing the labour of composition for both quires G and H. A similar routine can be observed in the method used to compose parts of quires N and Q, when again different compositors sometimes worked on successive formes at the same time. Not until quire R do we begin to find evidence of the two-compositor, two-case pattern of composition that was sustained throughout most of the last two sections of the Folio, the Histories and the Tragedies. This purely bibliographical investigation has at least two major implications for editors and textual critics of the early Folio Comedies. The first deals with cast-off copy for quires G and H. Ordinarily, as Hinman observed, when a quire was set in normal Folio printing order, there was need to cast off copy only for the first half of the quire, since the pages of the second half were set in their reading sequence: 4, 4 v , 5, 5 v , 6, 6 v (II, 505-506). However, simultaneous composition of successive formes of a quire—possible for quire G, probable for quire H—would have necessitated casting off copy for both halves of the quire so that compositors could work concurrently from separate blocks of copy to set pages of the second half of the quire. Thus editors must be wary of compositorial attempts to stretch or squeeze the texts of MM and Err. into the space available. One such attempt is evident in the last half of quire H at the bottom of column H5 v b, set by Compositor C, and the top of H6a, set simultaneously by Compositor B, where verse is compressed into prose. Second, identification of cases x, y, and z in quires G-I confirms attribution of pages in these quires to Compositors B, C, D, and F. Editors of the Folio Comedies may then have greater confidence in using the available studies of compositorial accuracy in arriving at judgments about when and how to emend.</field>

O'Connor, "Compositors D and F of the Shakespeare First Folio," SB , 28 (1975), 81-117. 5 Table I retains the line numbering of Hinman's graph, while expanding it where necessary (i.e., l. 1 becomes ll. 1.1 and 1.2), so that the types referred to in the graph may be recovered from Hinman's tables (I, 425-490). 6 An "indented flow-over" is produced when a compositor carries over a line too long for his measure to the next line and indents it two or three ems from the left margin (O'Connor, p. 89). 7 Centre-rule designators (i.e., B I) are included from Hinman's summary for quire H on II, 389. 8 Excluded from Hinman's graph in its revised form are recurrences in quire G of distinctive types from the first three formes of quire F, which were distributed during composition of the last half of the quire. Hinman expressed no confidence in the evidence of these recurrences when he wrote of quire F: "Probably because irregular distribution practices were followed, we cannot say which types do and which do not appear anomalously in this quire, or at any rate in the last two formes of it" (II, 383). After examining type-recurrence patterns in quire F, I can only concur with Hinman's judgment, and thus I have limited attention to distribution carried on during composition of quire G. 9 The ninth distinctive type in page I3 v is G24 common to I3 v b36 and E3 v a10, and the tenth is discussed below under "Anomalous Types." 10 On stripping accidents, see Hinman, I, 128-130. 11 The exceptional column K5b may not be exceptional at all. A paucity of distinctive types in this column forbids conclusive identification of the case used to set it. There are only three distinctive types in column K5b, two from page I2 v which provided identifiable types to no other Folio page, and one from I2a37. Since the only other distinctive type from column I2a is common to I2a43 and K5a51 (demonstrably set from case x by Compositor C), we might conclude that Compositor B set K5b from the same case, case x. Yet so often in the Comedies did compositors share distribution of the same columns when they also shared composition of a single page that it is equally possible that Compositor B distributed type from the upper part of column I2a, including I2a37, into case y, while Compositor C distributed lower I2a, including I2a43, into case x. If so, then Compositor B set column K5b from case y, and the association between individual compositors and cases is absolute for quires K-Q. 12 We are concerned here, of course, only with distinctive types distributed from pages F2-H5 v in the order of printing, that is, the material distributed to prepare for composition of quires G and H and forme I3 v :4. 13 The nine types are: W29 C4 v b37 L2a59; ss24 E1 v a18 G5 v a26; M 22 E2a17 G6a15; G24 E3 v a10 I3 v b36; h37 F4 v b49 G2a57; w34 F3a20 G2a57; f25 F2 v b49 G4b57; ffi21 F3 v b46 G5 v b43; and y23 F3 v b48 G5 v b23. 14 As Hinman acknowledged, his use of the case designators x and y was arbitrary, since the hiatus in intelligible type-recurrence patterns already noted in quires D-F prevents identification of the cases used for quires A-D as the same cases used for quires G-Q (II, 348). 15 Hinman's footnote (II, 345, n.1) indicates his search for more reliable evidence and his inability to find it: "Forme A2 v :5 seems to have no ordinary letterpress in common with either A1 v :6 or A3 v :4. . . . None, that is, of which we can be absolutely certain— though it may be that the same damaged type is indeed represented both by the defective 'n' in 'vnworthinesse' in A6b5 and by the very similar 'n' in the word 'In' at the beginning of A2 v b65." 16 As Hinman wrote elsewhere, "Of course the testimony of a single already distributed type . . . is by no means conclusive" (II, 28). 17 Although columns F4b and F5a were not the work of Compositor B, but instead that of Compositor C, these three type recurrences can hardly be used as evidence that Compositor C's case for quires A-F was indeed case y, not case x. It is not likely that three types distributed during composition of quire A would have remained unused in the case from which Compositor C set pages of three quires (B-D), only to re-emerge together in two columns of a fourth quire (F). The concentrated recurrence of the three distinctive types in two quire-F columns suggests, instead, that the three had just lately been supplied to whatever as yet unidentified case Compositor C used for quire F. As Hinman was able to demonstrate, the compositor who set F4 distributed non-Folio material (likely Wilson's Christian Dictionary ) just before he set the page, and thus the three distinctive types probably recurred in the Folio at this point because they were distributed into Compositor C's case from wrought-off pages of non-Folio material set from a different case (Hinman, II, 381-382).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Historical Collation in an Old-Spelling Shakespeare Edition: Another View by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul Werstine's article "Modern Editions and Historical Collation in Old-Spelling Editions of Shakespeare" ( Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography , 4 [1980], 95-106) leads me to attempt a few supplementary observations that may suggest ways around the difficulties he raises. I am the more encouraged to comment on his views in that during the development of his argument he did me the honor of quoting various of my past opinions. Dr. Werstine bases his case that an acceptable historical collation of modern variant readings (i.e., from the eighteenth century on) is inadvisable if not impossible as part of a critical old-spelling edition of Shakespeare on (1) "the pragmatic difficulties arising from any attempt to do them justice in a historical collation." As a supplement to this, he adds (2) "It also acknowledges the difference between the editorial principles governing critical old-spelling editions and those on which modernized editions are based, as well as the divergence in editorial principles among the editors of various modernized editions." In the coda he adds (3) "So wide are these differences as to make comparison of editions in a historical collation largely meaningless without elaborate textual notes explaining the collation" (p. 95). These three points may be viewed in order, although the first two are so interrelated as to require some occasional overlapping of discussion. Dr. Werstine takes it that the formation of a full substantive historical apparatus "implies collation of all previous texts of Shakespeare ," a feat obviously impracticable since "such a monumental task must distract an editor for years from the bibliographical, textual, and philological inquiry on which his edition will finally rest" (p. 97). One cannot deny the validity of this objection provided the premise be accepted. But I expect most scholars would agree that such a comprehensive collation of variants is suitable only for the Variorum edition of Shakespeare, now happily revived, and that the minutiae on a comprehensive plan of out-of-date editorial substantive variation should remain the province of the variorum principle, with which a modern critical old-spelling edition need have very little link. Dr. Werstine suggests, only to dismiss, the possibility of a selective list of editions to collate on historical principles. For instance, he rejects (properly, I think) the recording of all substantives even from the most prominent and influential of eighteenth-century editors, which "would swell a historical collation with many readings no modern editor could consider seriously" (p. 99). Could an editor, then, confine himself to nineteenth- and twentieth-century editions? Dr. Werstine thinks not, for "even the last century's editions are based on quite diverse editorial principles in order to satisfy a variety of audiences, and thus they necessarily differ widely among themselves and, as modernized editions, even more widely from an old-spelling edition." The conclusion is that the audience for an old-spelling edition is—for this section of the apparatus—exclusively concerned with the early editions on which the text has been based, and thus with "limiting the unnecessary interposition of editor between reader and text." This objective requires an apparatus that aims at allowing "the reader to reconstruct the copy-text from which the editor worked; hence too . . . emphasis on thorough collations of the early editions in an attempt to recover the author's final intention" (p. 100). Here, I think, we can make a break-in to consider the value that may be placed on an historical collation composed exclusively (as I understand it) of substantive variation in early editions of Shakespeare, or of other dramatists, from the readings of the edited text. First, we must tackle the argument that this shucking-off of all extraneous material (assumed to be the editorial emendations of later editions) would enable a reader the more readily to reconstruct the copy-text from which the editor worked, this taken to be the major preoccupation of a scholar consulting the apparatus of an old-spelling edition. As applied to the historical collation, which is the sole object of Dr. Werstine's inquiry, I am inclined to doubt the validity of his statement. If an old-spelling editor records his emendations in a series of textual entries separate from the historical collation that lists rejected substantive readings in the editions chosen for collation, 1 it is the emendation notation alone that acquaints a reader with editorial substantive changes in the text he is reading and thus enables him to construct the copy-text, provided the editor also lists either in these (foot) notes, or preferably in a separate part of the apparatus, the records of his alterations made in the copy-text accidentals. If one were confining the historical collation only to early editions, and if the copy-text were the only early edition, as in Marlowe's Jew of Malta , there could be no historical collation. That fact in itself should be sufficient to indicate that the historical collation has nothing to do with providing the reader with the information he needs to reconstruct the copy-text. Thus it would seem that Dr. Werstine has mistaken the function of the historical collation in respect to the reader's concern with reconstructing the copy-text (done entirely through the record of emendation, instead), and thus one of the bases for his argument fails. Even so, let us pursue the matter a little further and suppose that early editions do exist, as with Shakespeare. The first requirement is to define what one means by the term. For Elizabethan plays in general (loosely so called written before 1640), a convenient terminal date is 1700, although this cut-off point need not be rigid if there are special circumstances. Any such date as 1700 is arbitrary, of course, but it does enable an editor of Elizabethan plays reprinted in the Restoration to record variants in editions which by some obscure resort to theatrical tradition or to some now lost manuscript could theoretically contain readings to which authority might be imputed. 2 There is a further advantage in that 1700, very much in general, marks for some authors like Shakespeare especially, or Beaumont and Fletcher, or Marlowe, the beginning of formally edited complete editions which start a new textual tradition. Putting aside for the moment the question of an historical collation for variants after 1700, we may now ask, what is the point of recording variants in early editions whether for Shakespeare or other dramatists, or for any author? The circumstances divide neatly in two. In the first, as represented by Thomas Dekker or by Christopher Marlowe, only the first editions (which must of course be chosen as the copy-texts) have any authority: any later editions are mere reprints. In the second, either the author has deliberately revised a later edition, as Ben Jonson did with Sejanus and other plays in his 1616 Folio, or else as with Shakespeare's Richard III, Hamlet, Othello , or Troilus and Cressida a later edition either has had access to or was itself set up from a manuscript in a different tradition but one still deriving from authority. In this group may also be placed plays like Fletcher's Woman's Prize surviving in a manuscript but printed in the 1647 Folio from a different manuscript. In the first case, where no later edition has authority, the editor's private collation establishes the fact for all examples where (as it has in the Second, Third, and Fourth Shakespeare Folios) previous scholarship had not collected and analyzed the evidence. Although a later simple reprint may furnish a corrected but never a revised reading (one backed by an authoritative source), it is customary for an editor to credit the earliest document with the emendation (or correction) he has adopted. The reason for the custom is obvious. First, it establishes historically the precise details of the refinement of the textual tradition; second, the possibility always exists, as McKerrow observed, that a compositor (or some elementary form of editor such as the one who figures in the third edition of Dekker's Shoemakers' Holiday ), being nearer to the linguistic background of the author may guess rightly the usage and correct reading with some slight advantage over the modern editor and so his alteration might be given some modicum of respect. I may say that McKerrow's tentative hope is seldom shown to have any validity: modern standards of emendation, and modern philological resources such as the O.E.D. (when not misused) ordinarily mend a faulty text with more acumen than the rather innocent sophisticating guesses one often finds in early textual transmissions, as for instance in the Beaumont and Fletcher Second Folio. I rather think we can reassert, these days, that there is no 'secondary authority' in simple early reprints that in any generic way assists a scholarly editor to emend a text. In my experience, however, it has occasionally proved useful to be alerted from the evidence of a designed early variant that some near-contemporary thought the reading of one's copy-text was faulty. As often as not one may ponder the text with benefit, even though one may end by retaining and defending the original reading. On occasion, also, the signal that something could be wrong is legitimate but the editor may choose a different emendation from that of the variant early reprint. Usually, of course, since the reprint designedly corrects only the most obvious errors and with the most obvious readings, one may agree and assign that source for the change with no prejudice intended in favor of the correction. It is important to emphasize that all emendations made from non-authoritative sources are on an equal basis; hence a reading drawn from an early reprint has no more intrinsic validity than one suggested by an eighteenth-century editor—or by a twentieth-century one for that matter, including the editor presently at work. Thus the identification of the source of an emendation is partly a courtesy but chiefly an act of historical scholarship. This being so, one may logically inquire whether the usefulness of an historical collation, even of the early variants, under these circumstances warrants the effort of reading and the cost of printing. To be specific, are modern editions of Shakespeare like the New Arden 1 Henry IV which engage themselves to a collation of a series of early reprint Quartos as well as the First Folio in relation to the First Quarto copy-text, are these performing any useful function in their lengthy records of rejected unauthoritative readings? One part of the answer has already been given. As in The Comedy of Errors , for example, when no question can exist of any authority reentering the text, the record of the degenerative substantive variants in the three later Folios—like the record of the later octavos of Marlowe's Tamburlaine —provides no information whatever that is of use to a scholar evaluating the First Folio copy-text; and, of course, nothing that will enable him to reconstruct it if we take 'reconstruct' in the strict sense of the recovery of the exact details of the First Folio copy-text from the editorial ministrations in the old-spelling edition. Such a recovery is the function of the list of emendations, both substantive and accidental, the latter of course of no value in a modernized text. The most that can be said, perhaps, is that the collation of these early editions provides a reader with the opportunity to evaluate the later Folio variants that have been rejected, since it is possible that the reader may find some reason to second-guess the editor and to take it that the rejection was ill-advised and that a particular variant should have been adopted as an emendation. This is a legitimate object, without question, although it must be remarked that if the historical collation is limited to the early editions, the reader who fancies some rejected reading and would like to reconsider its validity as an emendation has no means, short of his independent investigation, of knowing whether some later editors have adopted the reading and even whether it may not have become a fixture in the modern textual tradition, despite its rejection by the old-spelling editor in question. One may also remark that for a newly edited author the record of the historical collation enables a reader to evaluate the editor's estimate of the authority or non-authority in the recorded early editions: the collation provides the full evidence of the early textual history on which the editor has based his judgment of the copy-text and its treatment. Thus, in the phrase, his cards are all on the table. However, this situation, applicable as it may be to Beaumont and Fletcher, does not apply to Shakespeare where the non-authority of the Second, Third, and Fourth Folios has long since been established. Finally, an historical collation of early editions can be justified, perhaps, even for Shakespeare, as a handy means to illustrate to readers, whether of modernized or of old-spelling editions, the various ways in which a text can degenerate, and be modernized and sophisticated as well as subject to inadvertent departures from copy. The more a scholarly reader studies the evidence of textual transmission, the wiser he may be in the ways of texts and their editing. Even a naive reader may be interested, for example, in the copious New Arden recording of the numerous Quarto as well as Folio variants in 1 Henry IV , and especially in the manner in which the Folio text was corrupted by its use of Q5 as setting-copy. However, for some plays of Shakespeare and a few other dramatists there is a gray area between the well-defined polarities of this first class of unauthoritative variants from mere Folio reprints as in The Comedy of Errors and the second major class where, as in Troilus and Cressida , the First Folio may indeed introduce fresh authority to be compared with that of the Quarto, and the proper copy-text and its eclectic emendation comes in question. Within this intermediate gray area, in the Folio setting-copy minor reference, more like touching up, has manifestly been made, derived from some other document, very likely a manuscript, although the Folio editor's knowledge of theatrical tradition cannot always be ruled out. But the authority of this document, or source, is moot in its details since we may not know or cannot reconstruct with certainty the details of its textual history or, most important, the exact use of it made by the annotator. In this category comes the attention to details of speech-prefixes given by the editor of the Folio Merchant of Venice as against the Quarto setting-copy. A clearer-cut example occurs in Richard II , Act I, scene i. In the Quarto it seems reasonably certain that Gaunt leaves the stage as part of the general exeunt at the end of the scene. But an exit in this place violates the principle of the clear stage, for the next scene begins with his immediate entrance in another place and at another time with the Duchess of Gloucester. 3 Almost certainly on promptbook authority, the First Folio inserts an exit for Gaunt at line 195 in the midst of the hot dialogue between Richard and Bolingbroke. The exit in this position is unmotivated and extremely awkward in various respects, including the fact that no exit line is provided by any revision of the text. Gaunt has not asked permission of the king to withdraw, nor is there any reason for his removing himself at this point. It is clear that the exigencies of staging created this exit in some document which the Folio editor utilized, one which in this and in other details affected the Folio text. The question then arises, if the Folio editor in this place compared the Quarto selected as setting-copy for the printer and altered it by reference to the reading of the promptbook, how many of the other variants in the two texts may not also have been inserted by comparison with the promptbook readings? This question brings up the probability of some form of authority introduced in the Folio from an independent source that could affect at least some of the variant readings, not necessarily because Shakespeare revised the copy behind the promptbook (although an editor must deal with this possibility) but because the book may have preserved authentic readings corrupted in the printing of the Quarto, that is, provided the Folio editor paid significant attention to readings within the text itself and not just the directions (an important proviso). Plays like these are, then, textually in a somewhat different category from, say, 1 Henry IV in which no certain signs of intervention in the Folio from fresh authority have seemingly been detected. 4 And the case is very different from that of The Comedy of Errors where the text first appeared in the Folio, and its reprints in the succeeding Folios can carry no authority at all. So far as providing the evidence for an estimate of authority, then, an historical collation of the early editions of The Comedy of Errors is worthless, whereas to a scholar using an edition of Richard II or The Merchant of Venice or Romeo and Juliet and endeavoring to follow the editor's choices among variant readings, the collation of the early editions has sufficient reason to justify its existence. The argument becomes more difficult when the general assumption holds that the Folio is a mere reprint of some Quarto which (whether or not 'edited') by common consent is taken to contain no reference to any other authority. May we not say that in such a case the historical collation of the Quartos and then on to the Folio and its successors is as worthless as that of The Comedy of Errors in F2-4 as evidence by which a reader can evaluate an editor's treatment of texts in which customary opinion takes it that no variants have any status except as they result from textual transmission? In one sense, yes, but in another, no. In fact, not all Quarto-Folio relationships need be quite so cut and dried as current opinion may suggest. Although we may have confidence in the judgment of presentday scholarship, past scholars felt the same about the scholarly estimate of the texts made by the Old Cambridge editors which in certain plays we now reject. It was not so long ago that J. Dover Wilson's arguments for authority in the Folio text of 1 Henry IV were thought to be worth consideration. At least they carried enough weight to provoke the scrupulous examination, backed by evidence of a full historical collation up to the First Folio, made by A. R. Humphreys in his exemplary New Arden edition to support his contrary view that no Folio authority exists. Thus in an old-spelling edition with some pretensions to definitiveness caution 5 might suggest the advisability of including historical collations for any subsequent reprints up to and including the First Folio even where present opinion declares them valueless as applied to the foundation of the text itself. 6 It may be that we think we know the Folio plays in which the editor touched up the copy by manuscript reference as distinguished from those that he neglected or in which he acted on his own initiative; but future generations may have a different opinion. Very much in general, opinion at the present time rests on an incomplete series of independent studies of the evidence of individual plays and we lack any authoritative analytical overview of what it is proper to call the editing of the Folio. Thus it may be argued that even for the present generation of critics an historical collation provides the material for evaluating the modern editor's judgment formed from his original research or from common opinion. 7 And, of course, consistency suggests the advisability—indeed the necessity—of providing all Quarto plays with identical apparatus, regardless of questions of authority. In the second group no difference of opinion can exist as to the need to record in an historical collation the substantive variants in Shakespeare editions that derive from two independent authorities. These separate into three fairly distinct classes. First, examples like Richard III in which it is demonstrable that the Folio editor or some surrogate (whether or not in the printing house 8 ) by annotation brought one or more Quarto editions into general conformity with a manuscript in cases where the printed copy represented a so-called 'Bad Quarto,' or corrupt text. Second, examples like Troilus and Cressida where the same operation was performed but the Quarto represented a good text though one in a different tradition from that of the manuscript. Thirdly, examples where the Folio printed a good text direct from a manuscript although a good Quarto was in existence (as may have happened with 2 Henry IV ) or where the Bad Quarto was too distant from the good text to serve as the basis for annotation, as with The Merry Wives of Windsor . 9 For the purposes of this discussion, however, the exact nature of the Folio copy is of little importance, fortunately: the whole matter revolves on the single question of the need (and sometimes the practicability) for an historical collation when double authority is present. The Shakespearean texts with two authorities are like such plays as Beaumont and Fletcher's Beggars Bush or Bonduca or The Womans Prize (preserved in manuscript as well as in print from a different source) in that a critical editor is forced into creating an eclectic text that will combine what in his opinion are the more authoritative readings drawn from the two documents, with due regard for what can be reconstructed of their textual prehistory. 10 In such situations where every variant has presumptive authority, and a choice of readings depends upon the editor's coherent theory of the histories, possible corruption in transmission, and the degree and nature of revision, whether authoritative or unauthoritative, 11 editorial opinion is bound to vary widely and it is essential that an historical listing reproduce the rejected readings of the document that was not chosen as copy-text but from which emendations have been levied as recorded in the emendations list. Only by means of such an historical collation can the full substantive facts of the authoritative texts be laid open to the inquiring reader. 12 This principle holds as much for the Bad-Quarto as for the Good-Quarto authorities, especially when an annotated Bad Quarto served as the setting-copy for the Folio revised text. As remarked, uncollatable Bad Quartos with no direct link to the Folio version will need in the main to stay uncollatable except insofar as their readings may be drawn on for emendation or as it is proper to record them as well when emendation of the Folio is made from the agreement of some later source. 13 Dr. Werstine is not specific about his recommended collation of early editions, but he tacitly seems to aim at including all four Folios: "Instead the rationale for excluding all editions after the Folios rest on the pragmatic difficulties . . ." (p.95). If this view be accepted, the question then arises for Shakespeare whether an old-spelling editor should rest content to stop the historical collation with the Fourth Folio, or whether he should agree to the arbitrary 1700 cut-off date (which thus would introduce all early editions before the seminal first collected edition by Nicholas Rowe), even at the expense on some occasions of detailed substantive variants recorded from a number of Restorations Quartos as in the five (actually four) of Julius Caesar that Dr. John Velz has so painstakingly identified and ordered. 14 This question of where to stop if an editor were to confine his record of rejected substantive variants to the so-called 'early editions' is affected by what may reasonably be taken as the special needs of a user of an old-spelling edition. (Since we are concerned with the apparatus alone, the problem of what is needed in the text itself may be put aside). One primary purpose of the apparatus being to enable a reader to reconstruct the copy-text, obviously all emendation, whether substantive or accidental, must be recorded, with its earliest source and the rejected copy-text reading. However, as has been suggested, the historical collation may be as important to the reader as the emendations list for those plays of double authority like Hamlet or Othello where an eclectic text is in order and the reader will be as concerned with what has been rejected from the alternative authority as with what has been accepted as emendations. This urgency to know immediately the alternative rejected readings along with those that have been retained from the copy-text lessens when the play has been only touched up by the Folio editor, even though a scrupulous reader will still want a complete substantive record of the variation; and it begins to approach a formality when the Folio is generally judged to be a mere unedited reprint and its variants of historical, not of critical interest. Nevertheless, since the status of the two texts may in the future be subject to re-evaluation, it would be anomalous and unwise for an old-spelling editor not to be consistent in always providing as complete a record for such plays as for those with double authority. Some scholar is sure to want the information for his own purposes that cannot be foreseen by an editor. The problem of recording Bad Quarto variants in an historical collation is too complex to discuss here in any detail. A full record would appear to be practicable for such plays as Richard III and King Lear but impossible for others. It may be that an editor can put together some combination of historical-collation recording with reprinted verbatim passages that are uncollatable placed in an appendix, roughly such as was attempted in dealing with the A and B texts of Doctor Faustus in my edition of Marlowe's Works (1973, revised 1982). Two major problems then face the editor. First, when Quarto reprints intervene between the Folio and the Quarto copy-text (normally Q1), consistency requires the inclusion in the historical collation of all intervening editions. Unauthoritative as such editions may be, they can assume a textual importance when the Folio was set from a Quarto other than a copy-text Q1. Without such a record, some Folio readings would be misunderstood as original variants when in fact they derive from the later setting-copy, or some ancestor Quarto, as happens in 1 Henry IV , for example, set in the Folio from the fifth of six earlier Quartos. Moreover, complications may ensue when, as with Richard III , more than one Quarto was used as Folio copy. The second problem is what to do about the Second through the Fourth Folios since in no case are these authoritative * . The answer here rests on one's estimate of the highly varied uses to which scholars may put the evidence contained in an old-spelling edition and its apparatus. (One should not fall victim to the all-too-common notion that one's own peculiar and often narrow needs are universal.) It seems reasonable to take it that the owner of an old-spelling edition should require it to be as definitive in its historical records as the editor has attempted to make it definitive in its text. That is, for many scholars the early historical textual records may have an independent interest. One major reason is this. The foundations of the edited textual transmission go back to Rowe in 1709, the first official editor of a collected edition, one that was influential in its day—but also one that was based on the Fourth Folio and its inferior text. Some Rowe readings, many of these being later corrupt Folio variants, persist through the eighteenth century and after as successive editors annotated some convenient earlier edition to make up their printer's copy. Moreover, subsequent eighteenth-century editors for some time did not begin to use the First Folio or the original Quartos systematically, in the process beginning the long haul of eliminating historically unauthoritative readings from edited texts. It follows that a presentday scholar should be able to utilize the historical records of all editions before 1700 as the universal foundation for any independent research into later textual tradition whether of the eighteenth, nineteenth, or twentieth centuries. This is not to urge a variorum principle: instead it is to insist that a scholarly old-spelling edition would fail in one of its important functions if it did not provide the complete pre-Rowe textual history for the substantives as well as for the important semi-substantives in which meaning has been subject to differences of opinion. 15 At this point (actually with F4) Dr. Werstine, as I take it, for a number of stated reasons would stop the historical collation. Although I do not agree, I have no serious quarrel with his view and I should not automatically fault an old-spelling edition that concluded its historical record short of 1700, a date which I should prefer to that of the Fourth Folio. With such a record the foundations of the pre-Rowe editorial tradition have been laid for whatever purposes different scholars will wish to utilize the information. Nevertheless, if no information is given in this historical record of variants after 1700, serious deficiencies would exist in the total provision that a scholar might reasonably require of an old-spelling edition. It seems to me to be an open question whether a post-1700 proposed solution to an important crux that ought to be considered by any serious textual (and even critical) scholar should be concealed merely because the old-spelling editor did not choose to adopt it and thereby to record it and its source in his emendations list. The problem that Dr. Werstine finds insoluble is how to include substantive variations in editions after the Fourth Folio (or after 1700, let us say) without turning the edition into a Variorum, a practice that should not be the intent for an old-spelling edition. Other dramatists present fewer problems. Thomas Dekker, for instance (whose edition Dr. Werstine cites) was scarcely edited at all in later times except for some small attention paid to The Shoemakers' Holiday in the nineteenth century, the selected-play Mermaid edition of no scholarly consequence, and a scattering of twentieth-century drama anthology reproductions of the texts of one or two plays. It seemed appropriate, therefore, to conclude the historical collation with 1700. On the other hand, Beaumont and Fletcher had a relatively active editorial history in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, although a negligible one in the twentieth. Even if one mars completeness by omitting a few collected editions that were substantially reprints without fresh editing, a minimum of five major editions that helped shape the text appeared between Langbaine the Younger in 1711 and Alexander Dyce's revised edition of 1877, and for some plays the aborted Variorum must be included as well as a scattering of modern texts, chiefly dissertations. For Christopher Marlowe from Oxberry's incomplete edition of c. 1820 to Roma Gill in 1971 (omitting the Pendry-Maxwell revision of 1976) no less than eleven post-1700 editions of some textual consequence appeared. Collation of these, in addition to whatever early reprints existed was not an insuperable task in the Cambridge Marlowe, nor did the recording of variants in the historical collation require an exorbitant amount of space. The effort involved was thought worth while since it gave a scholarly reader a relatively full conspectus of Marlowe's textual history up to the present. However, Shakespeare is another story because of the multitude of editions that flooded the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, various of them serious attempts at establishing the text at least according to contemporary standards. The considerable activity in the twentieth century has given rise to what is familiarly known as 'the Shakespeare industry.' It is this flood that causes Dr. Werstine to deny the possibility of an effective historical collation short of a variorum. If an editor, he suggests, were to attempt a conspectus of emendations, he would be forced to "turn to those editors responsible for most of the emendations still found in twentieth-century editions —Pope, for example, and Theobald, Hanmer and Capell. . . . Yet these early editors and scholars were so convinced of the unskillfulness and negligence of Shakespeare's printers and thus so prolific of emendations that they would swell a historical collation with many readings no modern editor could consider seriously" (p. 99). If one were to print, instead, a collation of nineteenth- and twentieth-century editions, the problem would be equally complex although different in the kind of variants, he continues. "Yet even the last century's editions are based on quite diverse editorial principles in order to satisfy a variety of audiences, and thus they necessarily differ widely among themselves and, as modernized editions, even more widely from an old-spelling edition. . . . Collation of an old-spelling edition with recent modernized texts seems merely to record the thoroughly predictable effects on the Shakespeare text of such differences in editorial policy and illustrates the influence that time, taste, and audience have exerted on modernized editions. . . . Variation simply results from individual editorial policies, each quite different from an old-spelling editor's policy. Of what use is the comparison of recent modernized editions to each other as a part of an old-spelling edition?" At this point I begin to part company with Dr. Werstine's logic. I agree completely that even a selection of eighteenth-century editions (and let us add nineteenth-century editions as well) could not be managed for a full substantive collation without the listing of more readings now presently in discard than could justify the expense and time save in a variorum edition. Moreover, the selection process would be so arbitrary and the number of recorded editions so limited by practical considerations that about as much useful information would be omitted as was provided, and the results could never be utilized by a scholar to attribute certain emendations to definite editors. Any attempt to provide only a partial collation of significant variants from important editors would satisfy no one. (Who takes care of the caretaker's daughter . . . . What is partial? What significant? Who important?) The question then arises, granted that the owner of an old-spelling edition may reasonably require a full substantive collation of early editions before 1700, granted that scholars concerned with Shakespearean textual matters would find that such a record obviated the time necessary for them independently to make the identical collations for any special text in which they had an interest, 16 it still may follow that this owner will find that actually he needs more information. The key to these reasonable requirements, I take it, is the fact that an old-spelling edition should not be a facsimile but instead a critically edited reading text, as well as a reference source for important textual information. The implications of the difference between a facsimile and an edited text are wide ranging. Once we abandon the concept that the primary reason for the edition's existence is not to serve as a reference work pure and simple like a Variorum, and admit that it has a double function, and that the offering of a conservatively edited but attractively presented text in its original dress is in fact more important than the non-selective record of variation, even among early editions, then we may progress to another view of the proper function of the apparatus that should accompany such a text. The essential apparatus is in two parts: first, the complete record of emendation, both substantive and accidental; second, the record of rejected substantive readings in a group of editions selected according to a principle that most economically and efficiently serves the need of the critically edited text. This last requirement is the heart of the problem that an editor faces; but even so, it cannot be tackled independent of the form taken by the emendations, for the two parts of the apparatus must mesh. In my own experience I have found it most practicable, and less intrusive for a reader, to separate the record of the more important emendations from those of lesser immediate interest; that is, to make one group of the editorial changes in the substantives, and another group of those in the so-called accidentals, or incidentals, or whatever one chooses to call them. 17 In addition to the reasons cited in footnote 17 immediately above, there are also other practical considerations. In the listing of substantive emendations to the copy-text it is vital that the editor provide the original (that is, the earliest) source, whether from an early edition or as a borrowing from a modern editor, and append, of course, the rejected copy-text reading. The reasons and I hope the virtues of this procedure have already been discussed. It instantly provides a reader with an historical perspective on the sources of the emendations a particular old-spelling editor feels are required to remove corruption, these being the primary concern with all texts in the simplest cases of single authority. However, when multiple authority is present the historical perspective includes the history of the eclectic reconstruction of what seems to the editor to be the best adjustment that should be made between conflicting authorities to insure a text that will attempt to represent not only the author's most correct but also his final intentions insofar as these can be determined by principled analysis of the evidence. The case seems to me to differ essentially when one comes to the assignment of a source for changes in the copy-text accidentals, the emendation of which is ordinarily found more often than not in the punctuation. If an editor chose, I suspect he could take full responsibility and provide no source whatever for the accidental changes that he felt were advisable or positively required, especially since it is his positive duty in an old-spelling edition to alter the accidentals strictly in accord with the general system of its time and, whenever possible, with the specific system in the work being edited. 18 Obviously, the rewritten accidentals imposed on a text by a modernizing editor after 1700 are so completely unauthoritative that to credit Pope, say, with what by Elizabethan standards in the copy-text is a clarifying change from a semicolon to a colon would be absurd, and even more absurd to credit Kittredge, or Dover Wilson, or Alexander with the same if any of them had been the first to adopt in a modernized text what by chance proved to be the specific form of punctuation that an emending old-spelling editor felt was consistent with the original early system of the copy-text. On the other hand, although it is true that each successive early reprint is bound to represent a form of printing-house modernization, and although it is also true that by 1700 the more Elizabethan rhetorical system of punctuation had been greatly modified in the direction of syntactical pointing, nevertheless it may seem useful to a reader to know the source of any editorial accidentals emendation when it has been provided by an early edition since there may be some slight editorial comfort in being backed by the opinion of a near contemporary, no matter how casual. It follows, then, that an old-spelling editor may usefully list the earliest source of any accidental emendation when it is drawn from pre-1700 editions but ignore any assignment of source after that arbitrary date when new-broom editors have taken over with their modernized reading editions according to a different system. Whatever assistance early editions may be thought to provide, an old-spelling editor's own principled opinion needs no support from post-1700 editors in the matter of accidentals save, perhaps, in some special examples of semi-substantives, which are not here in question. If this distinction be observed between providing the source for all substantive emendations but only a pre-1700 source for the accidentals, the use of two ranges of apparatus is almost required for consistency's sake; that is, footnotes to the text (preferably), readily visible to the reader for his instant reference by line number when substantive emendations have been made, but a separate appendix list for accidentals emendations containing for post-1700 alterations no information about the source of the change, which must be taken as reflecting only the editor's opinion of its necessity or advisability. Since the list of substantive emendations and the historical collation of rejected substantive readings are only two parts of a whole, the form of one must inevitably affect the form of the other. However, since the emendations list is the more important of the two, considerations affecting its form should be overriding and the form of the historical collation must be adjusted to it. For instance, if the historical collation were to be confined to early editions alone, two forms of an emendations note are possible. (Incidentally the two systems must not be mixed.) Suppose in The Comedy of Errors the editor accepts the F2 reading 'unhappie' for F1 'unhappie a', one form of note would read: I.ii.40 unhappie] F2; unhappie a F1. This is uncommunicative about the readings of F3-4 (silence about later editions cannot be taken to represent assent in emendation formulas); thus an historical collation entry would be required that would continue the information about the readings of early editions beyond the emender F2: I:ii.40 unhappie] unhappie a F1. This entry conforms to the standard convention that in this historical part of the apparatus all collated editions agree with the lemma save for those specifically excepted; F3-4, therefore, would be understood as agreeing with the F2 variant that had been adopted by the editor. However, if the historical record were to be strictly confined to the early editions, it would be practicable for most plays to omit the collational entry provided the necessary information were given in the footnote, as, for instance: I.ii.40 unhappie] F2-4; unhappie a F1. Emendation by a modern editor could still be handled similarly—II.ii.186 offer'd] Capell; free'd F1—with the collational entry; offer'd] free'd F1-4. Or with omission of the collational entry: offered] Capell; free'd F1-4. In such cases it is to be understood that the modern source cited was the first editor or commentator to adopt this emendation. Because of the limitation of the apparatus in these examples to the early editions, no information is given in the emendations note of the readings to be found in editors earlier than Capell even if they provided some other suggestion for 'free'd'. All that it is necessary for the reader to know here is that no edition before Capell read 'offer'd'. When two early collatable editions have authority, the rejected variants of the copy-text are, of course, recorded as part of the emendations entry, including the readings of both early authorities in cases where the emendation comes from a later source. However, for the convenience of the reader in these special situations of peculiar textual interest an editor ought to add regularly in the emendations notes (even when no emendation has been made in the copy-text) the rejected readings of the non-copy-text authority for immediate scrutiny instead of reserving them for the historical collation, viz (with or without the warning stet ): sallied] stet Q2; solid F1 for an edition of Hamlet using Q2 as copy-text. Such an entry calls for an historical listing that would fill in the readings of the remaining Quartos and Folios (including Q1 in this case) provided these were not introduced as part of the emendations entry in the expanded form. The forms of the emendations list for accidentals differ somewhat, owing to the nature of the material. Typical entries would be: free&amp;c.rat;] ˜, F1-4 force,] F2; ˜; F1 freed'd:] F4; ˜, F1; ˜; F2-3 force&amp;c.rat;] ˜, F1-4± The first entry indicates that the old-spelling editor drew his emendation from his own initiative, or possibly from the suggestion of some post-1700 edition. It would be otiose to track down and identify the source of accidentals to distinguish whether they had been found in modern editions or were of the editor's own devising. In the second of these the readings of F3-4 are not provided; whether or not they differed from F1 or F2 is of no consequence because this is an emendations list of accidentals that contents itself with providing only the earliest source for the adopted emendation, not an historical collation or a substantive emendations note with historical overtones. 19 In the third example convention requires the readings of all early editions to be provided prior to that chosen for emendation. The fourth illustrates a convention that is of some occasional use in cases of very mixed and minor variation but where the predominant reading is that cited. It is not particularly appropriate for the few items F1-4, which can be handled in exact detail; but the convention has its virtues when dealing with a large number of editions of no authority where a precise record is of little consequence and only the general consensus is of interest. After this survey of how much (or how little) historical information an emendation entry can carry, we come at last to the vexed question of the form and contents of a useful and practicable historical collation suitable for an old-spelling Shakespeare edition. The first problem for an editor is whether to duplicate in the historical record the information provided in the substantive emendation entries. (Accidentals except for the semi-substantive variety are excluded from the historical collation.) If we were to confine the collation to the four Folios as Dr. Werstine suggests (or at least to pre-1700 editions), and if the editor handled all information up to his last collatable edition in an expanded form of the emendations entry, then it would be a relatively simple matter to omit all substantive emendations entries from the historical collation since the identical information would otherwise have been provided in both places. On the other hand, if the preferred abbreviated emendations form of entry be employed, or if the amount of historical information the editor wishes to provide in the collation exceeds what is practicable for an emendation entry, then there is no escape from a certain amount of partial duplication. Duplication in the historical collation is of two varieties. In the most elementary form an editor notes the specific editions within the complete range of his collation that both agree and disagree with the lemma, which is, of course, the reading of the edited text whether the original or an emendation. For the moment let us suppose that we end the collated editions with F4. In the full form, then, an historical entry for 1 Henry IV , III.i. 231, might read: thou have] Q1-2; have Q3-F4 or thou] Q1-2; omit Q3-F4. But it is also an established, and indeed preferable, convention of historical collations that within the range of the collated editions any edition that agrees with the lemma need not be noted. Thus by this convention thou have] have Q3-F4 or thou] omit Q3-F4 is perfectly clear in stating that the copy-text Q1, followed by Q2, read 'thou' but that all early editions beginning with Q3 left out the word. Moreover, since the lemma must agree with the edited text, the information is also provided that the editor has rejected the unauthoritative Q3 variant and retained the copy-text Q1 reading. When the number of editions collated grows in number, the full form (which is needlessly repetitious) may grow unwieldy; hence most editors justly prefer the condensed form of entry. The second, and more important, problem of duplication concerns those entries where full duplication exists between the emendations note and the historical section. For instance, at III.i.239 of 1 Henry IV the Rowe emendation has been universally accepted: Come] Rowe; Hot. Come Q1-F4. Under such circumstances it is possible to query the usefulness of the duplication in the historical collation entry: Come] Hot. Come Q1-F4. The arguments for omission are chiefly economic in that the apparatus is shortened. On the other hand, there are advantages to scholars if the historical collation contains for easy reference in one place all substantive variation from the readings of the edited text without the necessity for a reader to conflate certain of the emendations entries with the historical collation in order to make the record complete. Whatever system is chosen should be capable of efficient consistency no matter what the textual situation for a given play. It would be abhorrent (because misleading) to have different forms of apparatus for different Shakespeare plays within an old-spelling edition. Thus an editor will need to consider, for example, the problem of overloading his emendation notes with an excess of unnecessary information that can result from the use of the expanded form of emendation note required if the historical collation entry is to be removed. For instance, in 1 Henry IV we would find the simplified emendations I.ii.77 similes] Q5; smiles Q1-4 II.iii.4 respect] Q6; the respect Q1-5 which provide only the earliest source of the adopted reading; these notes would require the completion of the information by the historical collation entries similes] smiles Q1-4, 6, F1 respect] the respect Q1-5 which tell the reader that, in the first, Q5, F2-4 agree with the lemma; in the second that Q6, F1-4 agree. To avoid this partial duplication in the historical collation of the details of the emendation entry, the expanded system of emendation notation would need to be consistently used, as in the forms similes] Q5, F2-4; smiles Q1-4, 6; F1 and respect] Q6,F1-4; the respect Q1-5, which may be thought to provide more information about the readings in unauthoritative editions after the origination of the emendation than a reader at this point would require. More complex situations would arise in other plays like Hamlet , for example, where both Q2 and F1 have authority but where three unauthoritative reprints intervene between the two, the readings of which must be recorded somewhere. That somewhere for Q3-5 and then F2-4 is certainly most conveniently managed in the historical collation so that the essential information about emendation may be slimmed down in its entry and not obscured or confused by notation of the agreement or disagreement (and sometimes the appearance of new readings) in unauthoritative editions. The problem is accentuated if in the historical collation an editor boldly ventures beyond 1700 and proposes to include, according to some principle, what he regards as significant editions in the textual tradition. Here a full record in the emendations note of all preceding readings in collated editions up to the earliest emender 20 could seriously overload the entry, particularly if the emendation were drawn from a source comparatively late in the tradition. On the whole, then, for early texts (more modern texts than Shakespeare may be another matter) it seems simplest and safest to accept the consistent principle of duplication, which enables an editor to write a more succinct and businesslike substantive emendations entry and then with flexibility according to the circumstances to provide the additional fuller information in the historical collation. It is now proper to consider the most important aspect of a proposal to include modern editions in the historical collation provided some adequate working principle can be evolved for their selection, for, as already remarked, the principle of selection is paramount in facing up to the problem. Indeed, it is possible that the more pertinent objections to including post-1700 editions would disappear if simultaneously with the selection of editions an additional principle were proposed governing the selection of the variants to record. One may start by freely accepting the proposition that any attempt to select a workable number of key editions from the eighteenth century to the present would be doomed to failure: the gaps between them in the history of Shakespeare's text could suppress almost as much important historical information as might be furnished by the selected editions, and any truly useful textual conspectus would involve too large a number of editions to record than would be manageable except on variorum principles. Some years ago I was asked to formulate detailed proposals for an old-spelling Shakespeare edition, although one that unfortunately never got off the ground. After much reflection and experimentation I arrived at the concept of an historical collation that would provide complete records of editions up to 1700 but would confine its records of modern editions to those in the major twentieth-century textual tradition, leaving all eighteenth- and nineteenth-century editions to the Variorum. The justification went as follows. First, the substantive emendations footnotes would include the earliest known source for any accepted variant from the copy-text, no matter where found, and thus every emendation adopted in the old-spelling edition would identify the eighteenth- or nineteenth-century editor who originated the reading whenever it had not been found in pre-1700 editions. Since it was inevitable that a conservatively edited old-spelling text would hew, very much in general, to the most tried and accepted line of emendations, the post-1700 significant variant readings would have their originator named in the emendations note. Thus an historical conspectus of the most commonly accepted Shakespearean emendations would be provided automatically, sufficient in this specific respect for the purposes of a non-variorum edition. Of course, to confine the historical record only to the accepted emendations would leave a number of debatable, but sometimes equally popular, traditional emendations unrecorded when they had not been adopted by the old-spelling editor. However, in considerable part this gap was to be covered by the historical collation of the most significant twentieth-century editions, which (along with any new emendations proposed by recent editors) would also record all their substantive readings that differed from the newly edited copy-text. If proposed emendations from the past of this sort were of such dubious account as not to have been accepted by at least one of the collated modern editors and thus to enter the record, not very much would be lost, perhaps, for the purposes of the kind of edition proposed, and its readers. 21 Second, the restriction of historical-collation entries to pre-1700 editions and then to selected twentieth-century ones removed a great deal of rubbish. It cannot be said, by any means, that every modern edition chosen represented the state of the art in presentday textual criticism; but at least a conspectus was given in historical perspective of what the more recently edited texts were like. This information is of as much concern for a reader of an old-spelling text as is the record of unauthoritative pre-1700 editions. As A. R. Humphreys most nicely remarks in his introduction to the New Arden 1 Henry IV , "the variants in later Qq and F have authority no greater than that of later editors, the authority merely of the light of nature" (p. lxxv). We may hope that the light of nature shines somewhat more brightly in recent years, for even a dwarf may see a sunrise more clearly when perched on a giant's shoulders. 22 The exact editions to choose can scarcely be prescribed. My own choice was to start with the Globe, since—as a slightly corrected derivative of the Old Cambridge text—it stands as the edition above all others on which subsequent textual tradition was built, and it is not unknown today in various reprints. Peter Alexander had to be chosen for the intellectual acumen with which (though somewhat unevenly) he revised a botched text that had been handed him. Moreover, his edition is justly admired and used in England. In the United States G. L. Kittredge's was standard for years although in fact it made very little contribution to the development of a new text despite Kittredge's vast erudition, largely confined to the notes in his splendid Sixteen Plays edition. J. Dover Wilson's pioneering New Cambridge texts, though often fantastic in their guesswork, made sincere attempts to apply bibliographical considerations (even if idiosyncratic) and cannot be ignored. We are then confronted with plays generally edited by a consortium, such as the New Arden, the Pelican, and the New Penguin, but nevertheless series that were under good editorial direction. The results are mixed but the texts must be recorded as making important contributions to the presentday tradition. The popularity of the much criticized and perhaps overconservative New Riverside, edited by G. Blakemore Evans, and also that of the David Bevington edition (revised) for Scott Foresman require their collation, the more especially since the comprehensive Spevack Shakespeare concordance is keyed to the New Riverside. These nine comprise what for the moment might be regarded as a master list, to which must shortly be added the Wells-Taylor Clarendon edition. Other editions or series have their points but need not have been edited with equal care or expertise, or else the volumes may not have had such wide circulation. The odds greatly favor that significant emendations from the past that have had any scholarly acceptance will be represented at least once among these editions and thus will be represented in the historical collation. 23 The combination of the information in emendation entries with that in the historical collation of an old-spelling edition would offer a true survey of substantive alteration (whether accepted or rejected by the old-spelling editor) that is representative of presentday scholarship in historical perspective starting with what may properly be called the first modern edition, the Globe derivative of the Old Cambridge. If the problem of the selection of post-1700 editions to collate may be solved thus, the second problem of what to collate demands attention, for 'substantives' is a slippery term. Here I think Dr. Werstine, as I read him, is overconcerned that a simple historical record of rejected readings in modern editions would fail to provide a reader with the rationale of the editors who adopted the emendations, at least without the old-spelling editor being forced to provide an impossible array of textual notes discussing divergences in most disputed readings. 24 My own view is that the textual notes in an old-spelling edition should be governed exclusively by the editor's concern to explain his own choice between debatable readings of most interest and importance. The reasons for preceding editors having adopted one or other reading (if known) may be of interest in such a note only in respect to the old-spelling editor's analysis of the bibliographical and philological evidence as justifying the acceptance or rejection of a reading in his own text. However true it may be that many presentday commercial editions are likely to follow a textual tradition alien in its modernization to that of the old-spelling, and hence one that is of little significance to record, nevertheless such a view does an injustice to those scrupulous new-school editors who have, on the evidence, surveyed the text with a fresh eye and whose major substantive readings are as individually considered as they would need to be in the more patently scholarly old-spelling edition. More important, perhaps, is Dr. Werstine's implication that the varieties of readings caused by different editorial policies (in the nineteenth and presumably in the twentieth centuries) either muddy the waters or are not worth recording. Here, it seems to me, his thesis tends to confuse true substantive variation with simple variation caused by modernization. This latter category, I take it, can be handled by a few arbitrary rules that will not reduce the value of what matters in the historical collation but will concentrate the entries on the only important variants from the point of view of an old-spelling edition . Only a few examples need be given to illustrate the kind of modernizations that the collation can omit. We may agree, I think, that modernizers who read twenty pounds or twenty years for the old idiomatic usages twenty pound and twenty year need not be recorded. Usually there is little consistency in editorial treatment of the you-ye doublet or the hath-has , doth-does , thy-thine , toward-towards , ' em-them , a-an , and-an . What modernizing editors do to such small-fry readings is of no concern to an old-spelling reader. 25 Of no concern, also, are modernized spellings or elisions intended to lead a presentday reader to the correct metrical value, or pronunciation, as of ne'er for old-spelling never , and the like. A middle ground is perhaps present in the general tendency of modernizing editors to restore agreement of subject and verb. This is the sort of variant that probably needs recording since it does involve a substantive form (usually a plural or singular of the verb) and one cannot count on unanimity of opinion among editors. Since no blanket statement can be made that would cover all editions, and since there will always be ambiguous cases where it may be a matter of opinion whether the subject is a plural or a compound singular, listing in the historical collation may seem useful even if the alterations first occurred in post-1700 editions and the entry did not carry on a pre-1700 variant with the record of modern editions. Moreover, in case of doubt as to the exact meaning an old-spelling reader can always be alerted to refer to the historical collation for a conspectus of modern opinion on the authorial intention. If we stick very narrowly to a definition of substantive reading as excluding ordinary modernizations, 26 some doubt may be cast on the application to problems of the historical collation of Dr. Werstine's distinction between the treatment of text found in modernized and in old-spelling editions: "The modernizing editor is free to emend as extensively as is necessary for his audience's comprehension of the text. 27 . . . Yet an old-spelling editor may vary from copy-text only when he can demonstrate in his notes that the text is probably corrupt, can identify convincingly the source of the corruption, and can substitute an emendation likely to repair the corruption. 28 Collation of an old-spelling edition with recent modernized texts serves merely to record the thoroughly predictable effects on the Shakespeare text of such differences in editorial policy and illustrates the influence that time, taste, and audience have exerted on modernized editions. . . . Variation simply results from individual editorial policies, each quite different from an old-spelling editor's policy" (pp. 100-101). This is certainly an overstatement if (a) we exclude the small change of modernizations that can be brought under the heading of substantives only by a wrench and that are not the concern of a sensible and practicable historical collation geared to the needs of an old-spelling reader; (b) we confine the post-1700 editions collated to a selected group of the most influential and respected of the twentieth-century modernized texts. It is a curious concept that when real substantives are concerned the editor of a careful modernized text is inclined to emend more freely than an old-spelling editor. After all, both are equally concerned to present what they believe Shakespeare actually wrote; their concerns differ only in adjusting the forms that these words may take. It is very likely that Dr. Werstine's views about the policy proper for an old-spelling text are unduly conservative (as evidenced by his repetition of Greg's dicta that are sometimes impossible to implement), or else he worries unduly about listing in an old-spelling edition's collation some of the more far-out guesses in which, say, Dover Wilson or Charles Sisson occasionally indulged. Moreover, some of his concerns about overloading the collation stem from a few examples of nineteenth-century editors having mistakenly used the wrong copy-text, although even here—since the alternative text would have authority—its readings must be fully entered and there is no problem merely in appending the sigla for the modern editors who have followed such readings. A properly constructed historical collation of Shakespearean texts, and one suitable for an old-spelling edition and the needs of its readers short of the variorum principle, lists no more variants than are of real concern to a reader intent on reconstructing the presentday textual tradition bearing on the actual words that different editors have taken Shakespeare to have used, despite the fact that this tradition is at present and in the foreseeable future, unfortunately, confined exclusively to modernized texts. 29 Even so, the better modernized texts are as closely concerned with true substantives, in a lexical sense, as would be any series of old-spelling editions, and so are as worthy of record.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am assuming the separation of emendation entries either by placement as textual footnotes at the bottom of the text-page, as preferably for substantives, or else in a different section of the apparatus from the historical collation. A few editors (ill-advisedly in my opinion) combine emendations and the historical collation in one list, either as footnote entries or as an appendix. The function of these two parts of the apparatus is so different as to make it an anomaly—and a distracting one—to consider the record of an editor's emendations of the copy-text a part of the historical collation, which (although it may repeat the emendations-entry information in its own different form) is chiefly concerned with recording rejected, not accepted, readings that are variant from the edited text. 2 An example, although not perhaps an exact one, occurs in the Beaumont and Fletcher Second Folio of 1679 where its editor was able to compare the 1647 Folio text of some plays with a manuscript, probably the promptbook; hence a few plays contain additions and variant readings stemming from fresh authority albeit these may be imbedded in a texture of unauthoritative changes. 3 This principle of the clear stage, so essential for the Elizabethan theater to observe, was also violated in the Folio All's Well That Ends Well and in Measure for Measure , both seemingly derived from Shakespeare's working papers, although in Measure for Measure through the medium of a Ralph Crane transcript. 4 This is the conclusion of A. R. Humphreys, the New Arden editor, who examines the evidence with care. However, one must be cautious in making blanket statements about almost any Folio play deriving from a Quarto. The same lack of authority has usually been attributed to F Romeo and Juliet ; but for a persuasively argued view that the F editor did indeed consult a manuscript, see S. W. Reid, "The Editing of Folio Romeo and Juliet ," in this volume. Even when consultation of a manuscript cannot be inferred, the deliberate variants of an actor-editor may reflect some attenuated authority. 5 For instance, the example of Dr. Reid's study of Romeo and Juliet might encourage some future scholar to have still another look at 1 Henry IV for the possibility that the F editing was occasionally buttressed by some reference to a manuscript. 6 The abuses to which ill-informed readers may put the evidence of historical collations by preferring sophisticated, smoother, or easier readings that they discover although their training has not enabled them to evaluate authority is, of course, no proper concern of the editor. In this matter we cannot be our brothers' keepers. 7 It is a bit lordly to insist that such a critic should be prepared to perform the essential collations himself if he is to investigate the matter. If the apparatus of an old-spelling edition is not sufficient to serve as a basic reference for textual scholarship, it has lost an important reason for its existence. 8 That Blount as a publisher, or Jaggard as a printer, would at leisure annotate a Bad Quarto from the manuscript furnished by the Folio editor, this annotation presumably as an aid to faster typesetting, is an hypothesis sometimes advanced but quite without evidence, and it is one that had better not be given any credence until some better evidence is offered. (The normal reference manuscript at this date would ordinarily be a promptbook, which would not be allowed to leave the theater.) Some years ago, to explain certain signs of Q1 influence on Q2 Hamlet (annotation scarcely being in question), I suggested the possibility that as a convenience for dealing with a difficult manuscript the compositor of Q2 Act I might have had a copy of Q1 pinned up over his cases as a guide ("The Textual Relation of Q2 to Q1 Hamlet," Studies in Bibliography , 8 [1956], 39-66). But no Quarto-Folio play seems to have had anything like this arrangement. 9 Whether any examples actually exist of good texts in the Folio which have no derivative relation from a good Quarto is still moot. Cases like 2 Henry IV are still argued, and F Hamlet is not entirely demonstrable by bibliographical evidence as set from annotated printed copy. Some plays generally accepted in F as deriving from annotated good quartos. like Othello , are being subjected to second thoughts as a result of compositorial studies. Even generally accepted annotated Bad Quartos for F copy like King Lear find some scholars who argue for setting in F from an independent manuscript. 10 The term 'authoritative readings' is to be taken in two senses. In the simplest, one document offers the right reading for a corruption in the other. But in some cases when authorial revision has been involved, as seems to have happened with Troilus and Cressida , both readings will have authority in the sense that they represent what one presumes Shakespeare actually wrote, but one document contains a revision and hence, in this special sense, is more 'authoritative' than the other in representing the author's final intentions. 11 A play could be revised by someone other than the author, as, say, for purposes of production or, later, on revival. For an example of production revision, see my note "Establishing Shakespeare's Text: Poins and Peto in 1 Henry IV," SB , 34 (1981), 189-198. As another example of mixed authority one may cite the various readings that critics have singled out in annotated Bad Quartos where the annotator seems to have made a mistake in annotation or else himself entered a reading not found in the manuscript he was working from. 12 Accidentals would be too complex and in most cases too critically meaningless to attempt a record of variation on an historical basis except as part of the accidentals emendation list where the readings of both primary texts would be provided when the accidentals emendation was drawn from the non-copy-text authority, but not otherwise. 13 For instance, except for portions of Act I, Q1 and Q2 Hamlet are uncollatable on a consistent basis. Yet for specific debated readings like Q1 dead vast and middle of the night versus Q2-F dead waste , an editor choosing waste might well feel required to analyze his choice in a textual note. It would also be proper, and indeed required, for the Q1 reading to appear in the historical collation as the source for the record of modern editors' choice of vast , but not otherwise. 14 "'Pirate Hills'" and the Quartos of Julius Caesar," PBSA , 63 (1969), 177-193. * C. J. K. Hinman's machine collation of multiple copies of the First Folio has effectively removed all possible suggestion that a Second Folio variant could derive from an unrecorded authoritative press-correction in the First, although it has not entirely removed the possibility that a Second-Folio variant could derive from a presently unknown uncorrected state of the First, the authority of which reading could be argued. 15 This is not the place to enter upon a disquisition as to the meaning of the term semi-substantive . (I do not especially favor the alternative term 'quasi-substantive.') I take it to refer narrowly to the kind of textual reading that in its form would normally be excluded as an accidental were it not that, say, ambiguous spelling as in travail-travel has given rise to substantive variation among early editions (and their successors) according as different meanings were selected; or ambiguous punctuation has substantively affected meaning such as occurs in Hamlet's What a piece of work is [a] man speech, for example. 16 Such full information is usually available only in the Variorum volumes that have been published. However, the Variorum is still greatly incomplete and proceeding very slowly; hence one may hope that some brave publishing house will agree to issue an authoritative old-spelling edition before the Variorum is completed, although the present prospects are not bright. Moreover, since the Variorum is an essentially unedited reprint of whatever copy-text has been selected (the older ones with variable standards of collation), many scholars (one assumes) will wish to own for their private use a critically edited old-spelling edition to be used simultaneously for the most informed general reading as well as for reference, this last the sole usefulness of the Variorum volumes. That there is something so forbidding about the old-spelling concept as to remove it from use as a general reading text is a fallacy. By simple typographical adjustments, and by some attention to occasional emendation of the punctuation for clarity according to its own standards (not modernizations), it is possible to construct old-spelling texts that even undergraduates can manage without difficulty, as illustrated by the Marlowe and the Beaumont and Fletcher editions, I trust. George Walton Williams reports ready undergraduate acceptance of his old-spelling Romeo and Juliet text (Duke University Press, 1964). 17 I take it that a reader has a more immediate interest in knowing, as he reads, what changes the editor has made in the copy-text wording than in the minor cleaning-up process of alterations in the accidentals, where meaning has not been singularly affected. Thus the rationale for the separation of the two parts, at least in early texts where the amount of substantive emendation called for may be considerable by ordinary standards of nineteenth- or twentieth-century texts, but where the much larger amount of accidentals emendation may have a tendency to obscure this much more important record of substantive alteration when intermixed. Moreover, I like to serve the convenience of the reader by placing substantive emendations at the foot of the text-page in all editions where policy does not call for a clear-text page. The list of accidentals alterations is then segregated in an appendix along with the textual notes, this historical collation, and any other sections of the apparatus that conditions may require. Among the substantive emendations footnotes I automatically subsume without distinction the semi-substantives, according to my own notions of their effect on meaning in a truly substantive (not in an imagined) manner. 18 In order to preserve the immediate texture from anomalies introduced by the form of the emendation, an editor may need to adjust not only the accidentals of a substantive change, but also the system of the alteration of an accidental itself (as in the choice of either a colon or a semicolon or a comma for the punctuation of the original), by careful adjustment to the ascertained characteristics of the compositor who set the Quarto page or the Folio column. 19 Since accidentals vary so much more widely between different editions than do substantives, and since in all cases of simple reprints any later reading can have no authority, the fact that an early edition happens to have printed a reading which the old-spelling editor prefers to that of the copy-text is of interest only historically, as remarked earlier. Hence the simple identification of the immediate source is sufficient. It is also of some account that, unlike the substantives, the accidentals of early editions had, in general, little or no effect in establishing the accidentals of the modernizing post-1700 editorial tradition. It follows that an historical survey of accidentals variation would be practically meaningless, even if it were no more than to continue the history beyond the immediate source to the last collated edition. 20 If this record of the readings of collated editions is not to be provided in the historical collation, it must appear in the emendations entry. Moreover, further complications ensue if the adopted emendation is not followed by some of the collated editions after its point of origin. This situation is readily handled in the historical collation but less so in the emendations listing. 21 An ideal, but one very likely unreachable with accuracy except at extravagant cost of time, would be to record within parentheses the earliest editor who originated the rejected emendation being listed as the reading in one or more modern editions recorded in the historical collation. 22 Twentieth-century editions vary widely in merit, of course, but not all warrant Dr. Werstine's general dismissal as popularized texts, which presumably have sacrificed textual integrity to modernization for a student audience. The care that a respectable number of editors have bestowed in their treatment of the texts compares favorably with what they would have done as old-spelling editors. (This independent research is especially true of the new modernized edition currently under preparation for Oxford by Messrs. Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor.) Of course, various commercial texts have been ground out to order, with royalties of more concern to the producer than a fresh shaping of the text. The ultimate consumers are in part to blame for indifference to textual matters in modernized editions, especially those for school use. I have been told, and it could easily be true, that once when a well-known scholar was hired to produce a new one-volume edition, the publisher polled the country's educational establishment and came up with the request that the familiar Globe text be reprinted as the basis for the eagerly anticipated new annotations. It is not really remarkable that textbook editions sell more on their illustrations and their notes than on any textual innovation. 23 That is, the reading would be represented by the record of its adoption by some one or more of the collated editions from the Globe to the Clarendon, although the old-spelling editor had decided to reject the emendation. As remarked above, it would be an asset, and one of some interest to the reader even though laborious for the editor, if provision were made in the historical collation entries of rejected readings for the identification of the earliest edition which had made the rejected emendation, as ought to be done in the emendation entries for accepted ones. 24 For instance, it is no concern of the architect of an historical collation whether the New Arden editor of The Comedy of Errors , as Dr. Werstine wonders (p. 98), printed at V.i.370 "And are you not my husband?," as a designed emendation of F are not you , though not accompanied by the usual note recording the Folio variant, or whether, as likely, it was a slip owing to his having annotated some earlier edition with the transmitted error (which goes back to the 1773 Variorum) as setting copy, the departure from the Folio not observed. He continues with the case of editors who chose the Folio Hamlet as copy-text instead of Q2, and inquires, "How is a contemporary old-spelling editor to determine when previous editors adopted Folio readings because they took the Folio text as copy-text and when they adopted Folio readings on the intrinsic merit of the readings?" (pp. 98-99). I suggest that if an historical collation is to represent a record of the twentieth-century textual tradition, the causes for the variation in readings among the collated editions is of no concern to the editor himself (once he has considered his own choices and rejected the variant), or indeed to his readers unless some one scholar alerted by curious variation in a modernized edition wishes to make a private albeit speculative study of its rationale, usually buried with the editor. Even the Variorum seldom comments on the problems that unnecessarily trouble Dr. Werstine. 25 I suggest, however, that when any such modernization appears in a pre-1700 edition it should be recorded as of philological interest. In such cases, but in such cases only, the sigla for the appropriate modern editors can be added to the entry for the sake of consistency in following each listed variant up to the final collated edition. 26 Some illustrations of procedure may be found in the historical collations of the ongoing New Cambridge Beaumont and Fletcher edition or the revised Cambridge Marlowe. 27 However true for the modernizing of forms just discussed above, it is not true for real substantives. For example, it is difficult to conceive of a presentday editor substituting a modern equivalent as a different word for an obsolete word in the copy-text, etc. 28 These requirements are drawn from Greg, but even the most conservative editors honor them little in the observance, for if literally followed they would choke off many important and doubtless correct emendations. In fact, they exhibit a far too simplistic optimism in an editor's ability to identify the source, especially in cases of complex textual transmission. Even after an editor has come to some conclusions about the nature of the printer's copy, whether holograph or scribal, to judge between paleographical misreading and scribal or compositorial memorial error, or a plain inexplicable foul-up, may well prove impossible. For example, when surveying Sisson's often plausible but just as often misguided emendations based on supposed misreadings, one should recall Greg's wry comment that the chief use of paleography in emendation is to confirm a conclusion already arrived at by other means. Many famous emendations fail to meet Greg's idealistic but impracticable criteria, including "'a babbl'd of green fields": talk'd has been suggested as paleographically the easier source if table is actually a misreading. 29 Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor are now confirmedly planning a one-volume old-spelling edition of Shakespeare based on their forthcoming modernized text for the Clarendon Press. An historical collation is not proposed as a part of this old-spelling edition, however.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Editions, Imitations, and the Influence of Marcellus Laroon's Cryes of the City of London by Sean Shesgreen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I While there has never been any doubt that Marcellus Laroon's (1653-1702) Cryes of the City of London Drawne after the Life is "the most important set of cries published in England," there has been considerable confusion about the various editions and transformations of this publication. 1 The life of this handsome ensemble of prints, the first cries in England to achieve aesthetic status, is both extensive and involved. It reaches from 1687 to 1821 and comprehends many different publishers, imitators, and plagiarists. This essay is intended as a contribution toward a complete history of Laroon's set of engravings with a short account of their influence. The greatest difficulties with the Cryes of the City of London concern the earliest editions. The Term Catalogues specify five editions prior to 1700. The first, announced for Michaelmas Term, 1687 (ed. Arber, II, 207), describes an edition published by Pierce Tempest, containing an unspecified number of engravings. The second, announced for Hilary Term, 1687/8, describes an edition published by Tempest with forty copperplates "newly drawn after the Life. . . ." ( Term Catalogues , II, 218). The third Tempest edition, the subject of the first part of this paper, is announced in the Term Catalogue for Trinity, 1688, as containing sixty copperplates ( Term Catalogues , II, 231). The fourth Tempest edition (Michaelmas Term, 1688) is announced as containing seventy-two copperplates ( Term Catalogues , II, 240), and the fifth Tempest edition is advertised (Trinity Term, 1689) with seventy-four engravings ( Term Catalogues , II, 281). One certain copy of the fifth edition (Trinity Term, 1689) is in the collection of the British Museum, and one certain copy of the fourth (Michaelmas Term, 1688) is in the London Guildhall Library. 2 No copies of the third, second, or first editions are known to exist. Until now, one piece of "evidence" has been offered on behalf of the existence of a third edition. In his monograph Marcellus Laroon , Robert Raines asserts that "in support of there having been an edition with sixty plates is the fact that the number of plates of the dismembered copy in the Pepysian Library is exactly sixty. . ." (Raines, Appendix III). Raines obtained his information from an unreliable source, for no such edition of "exactly sixty" plates exists in the Pepysian Library. According to Mrs. E. M. Coleman, the Assistant Librarian at the Pepysian, the Library's edition contains only fifty-two prints plus two title pages. Furthermore according to a list of plates kindly supplied me by Mrs. Coleman, the Pepys Library's copy contains "Any Bakeing Peares" and "New River Water," both of which were executed for the fifth edition when the number of plates was increased from seventy-two to seventy-four. Consequently, the Pepys copy cannot be used as evidence for the existence of the third edition of 1688 and, in all probability, must itself derive from the fifth edition (Trinity Term, 1689) or even one subsequent to it. But while the Pepysian Cryes of London is irrelevant to early editions of Laroon, two others have recently come to light which, taken together, provide a basis upon which it is possible to verify the publication of the third edition and, more important, reconstruct its contents. The first of these copies with fifty-nine unnumbered engravings is now in the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, to which I am indebted for a reproduction. Its impressions are bright, vivid, and sharp, arguing for an early date of origin. Because the fifth edition is the first impression to contain a full set of seventy-four engravings, it is a useful model against which to collate other editions. When the Texas copy is collated with the fifth edition, it is found to lack plates 48, 49, 50, 52-61, 69, and 71. (The plate numbers are Henry Overton's, the first publisher to have numerals engraved on every design; the date of Overton's edition is unclear and may be 1711, 1731, or 1733). The second of these copies is part of the Virginia Warren Collection now in the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Bound in seventeenth-century calf and preserved in very fine condition, this copy also contains fifty-nine unnumbered prints. While the sequence of the plates in the Texas copy appears random, the sequence in the Indiana copy has an affinity with a scarce Tempest edition c. 1709 now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in that the order of the first twenty-four plates in both books corresponds exactly. This correspondence argues that the Indiana copy's terminus ante quem is 1709 and suggests that the sequence of its plates has an authority reaching back to its date of publication. The impressions of the Indiana copy are crisp, well-defined, and contrastive; identical in condition to those of the Texas copy, they too were taken from the copperplates before they had become worn. When the Indiana copy is collated with the fifth edition, it lacks plates 49, 50, 52-61, 69, 71, and 74. To summarize, the Indiana copy lacks plate seventy-four (present in the Texas copy). The Texas copy lacks plate forty-eight (present in the Indiana copy). Together, the two books make up a set of exactly sixty plates. With the single exception of plate seventy-four, the unique sequence of missing plates in the Indiana copy is identical to the sequence of missing plates in the Texas copy, both lacking numbers 49, 50, 52-61, 69, and 71. Is this correspondence involving fourteen identical plates in two cries merely a matter of coincidence? What is the mathematical probability that these two books of fifty-nine plates are subsets (mathematical sets contained within master sets) of the third edition of sixty plates rather than subsets of the later editions of seventy-two or seventy-four plates? Mathematical probability confirms what intuition suggests must be the answer to this question. If both copies were in fact subsets of an edition of seventy-four plates and in the course of time both lost fifteen plates, the probability that both would lose the same fourteen plates is ten to the minus ten, assuming that one thousand copies of the fourth and the same number of the fifth edition were originally issued. 3 In layman's terms, the probability that both the Indiana and Texas volumes would lack the same fourteen plates is 1 in 10,000,000,000 or one chance in ten billion. On the basis of this figure, the notion that the correspondence under discussion is accidental is untenable. It may safely be assumed then, that the missing sequence is not a random matter but is to be accounted for by the fact that both copies are subsets of an original edition of sixty plates. As imperfect copies of a suite of sixty plates, the Indiana and Texas Cryes together confirm the long-suspected publication of the third edition of 1688, and for the first time, reveal the identity of its engravings. A list of these engravings taken from the Indiana copy (because of the authority of its sequence) appears in an appendix. The last known edition of Laroon's Cryes to be published by Pierce Tempest is recorded in 1709 ( Term Catalogue , Easter and Trinity Term [ed. Arber, III, 647]). Until now, one copy (referred to above) believed to date from around 1709 is known to have survived; it is in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. The survival of three other rare Tempest editions from the same time period as the Morgan copy must now be recorded. The first of these is in the Virginia Warren Collection in Bloomington. The early state of the two title pages (all pre-1760 Laroon's have two title pages, plate one and —usually—plate thirty-seven) of this Warren Cryes and its unnumbered designs establish that it was published by Tempest. The order of its plates bears no resemblance to that of the Morgan copy or the later Overton edition. Probably established when the volume was last bound, its sequence seems to have no special authority. The Warren copy, the only one I have seen in which all the plates are colored, lacks two engravings, "A Nonconformist Minister" (plate seventy-three) and "Frater Mendicans" (plate seventy-four). The two remaining Tempest editions, both containing complete sets of seventy-four prints, are in the Huntington Library. The first of these is printed on paper containing the countermark "P lOLLY," who worked only between 1699 and 1715 (Muir, rev. of Kaufrufe und Strassenhändler , 561). The second Huntington Tempest, the gift of Mrs. E. Bodman, contains a suite of brilliant impressions. The most interesting fact about these two Tempests is that although their provenance is different, the order of their plates is identical and so may represent the sequence of plates in Cryes which appeared in the early eighteenth century, prior to the Overton edition. The first twenty-five plates in both copies replicate the order of the plates in the later Overton edition; thereafter three groups totaling twenty-six plates are out of sequence with Overton but in sequence with each other. It has often been assumed that the plates to early editions of Laroon were engraved by Pierce Tempest himself (Raines, Appendix III). It has also been suggested that the entire set was probably cut by John Savage, who signed a number of the plates. 4 On the basis of a hitherto unnoticed advertisement for the fifth edition ( London Gazette , 25-28 February 1688) describing the designs as "curiously engraven by the best Artists," it is now safe to assert that the copperplates were executed by a variety of hands in the atelier of Tempest. From Tempest, the Laroon plates passed into the hands of Henry Overton. Precisely when this transfer took place is a matter of some uncertainty. Karen Beall gives the date of the first Overton edition as 1711 (?), and designates it E10 in her monumental bibliography of cries and itinerant traders from around the world. 5 Percy Muir thinks the transfer took place later (Muir, rev. of Kaufrufe und Strassenhändler , 558-562). In the Overton Laroon the phrase "In 74 Copper Plates," appears in the first title page, below the words "Drawne after the Life"; the phrase "Printed &amp; Sold by Henry Overton at the White Horse without Newgate London. 1711 [?]" is included in the publication line; and numerals have been engraved in the lower right hand corner of each plate. Beall records Overton editions in the Mellon Collection and the Huntington Library in the United States (Beall, p. 136). The Huntington copy is especially interesting because it identifies eleven of the criers with historical personages and cross references them to sketches in James Granger's Biographical History of England . To these Overton editions must be added two others, a vivid impression in the Kress Library, Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration, and a beautifully bound impression in the New York Public Library, which has a distinguished collection of cries and itinerant trades. Overton editions are offered for sale from time to time. A recent rare book catalogue offered a complete edition (for the sum of £2,000) which identified, in a contemporary hand, "A Nonconformist Minister" (plate seventy-three) as a portrait of the publisher ( Catalogue One Thousand , 191). In a category by itself is an Overton in the Rare Book and Special Collection Division of the Library of Congress which obliged me with a xerographic copy through Karen Beall and Leonard Beck. This edition, in which some "plates have been altered to bring the costume into the fashion of the time of republication" and to which six additional plates have been appended, is classified in the National Union Catalogue as a 1711 Overton. 6 Though the publication date on this volume is to me indecipherable and may be read as 1711, 1731 or 1733, there can be no doubt that it is an Overton edition. Its first title page matches that of other known Overtons as does the order of its plates, their contents, and their titles (with three minor exceptions: plate two's title is excised; plate sixty-three is retitled "The Bartholomew fair Musician"; and plate twenty-three is titled in a fourth language—Dutch—instead of just the usual three). Despite a basic similarity, the Library of Congress copy deviates from other Overtons in the way certain criers are depicted, in the signatures and engraved numbers on the plates, and in the decorative framework surrounding the criers. Taken together these major departures suggest that the Library of Congress volume is an unusual Overton indeed. As the entry in the National Union Catalogue points out, some plates in the Library of Congress copy have been altered. By my survey, plates 5, 10, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 36, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46, 55, and 59 have been retouched; criers' hats, scarfs, faces, necklines, and shoes have been modified to reflect changes in fashion and shifts in standards of feminine beauty. In addition, one ("The merry Milk Maid," plate twenty-three) has been entirely re-engraved; it is signed by Jacob Gole (see footnote 9 below). No other Overton with modernized or re-engraved plates has been recorded. However, to anticipate briefly the history of the Laroon designs, when the copperplates passed from Overton to their next proprietor, Robert Sayer, he reissued them around 1760 in an edition of six parts in which virtually all the engravings (those listed above and a substantial number of others) were modernized and updated in precisely the manner I have just outlined. In all known Overtons, the following signatures or some variation on them appear in the lower portion of each sheet outside the picture frame: "MLauron delin: P. Tempest exc: Cum Privilegio." When the plates were republished by Sayer, all such identifications were excised. In the Library of Congress Overton, signatures remain on forty-five images but have been removed from twenty-nine. In all known Overtons, numerals are engraved in the lower right corner of each print within the picture frame. When the prints were reissued in six parts by Sayer, two numbers (one specifying the sequence within each part, the other within the entire volume) appear in the upper left and right portions of the image in parts two through six inclusive. In the Library of Congress Overton, thirty-seven prints are entirely without engraved numbers, thirty-three have numbers in the lower right hand corner (as in other Overtons), two have numbers in the left and right upper corners (as in Sayer), one has a number in the upper right hand corner only, and one has a number in the upper and lower right corners (as in other Overtons and Sayer). In all known Laroon's (including Sayer's), a border composed of two or three lines encloses the crier and his or her immediate environment; outside this border and below it, the title to each picture appears. In the Library of Congress Overton, this border and the picture title are enclosed by a large rectangular frame not present in any previous or subsequent edition. This encompassing frame is made up of a single engraved line and appears in every plate with the exception of the first title page. Additional modifications of an experimental and incomplete character have been made to individual borders and frames which suggest that the publisher was attempting to elaborate a more picturesque and ornamental structure within which to feature the criers. In plate sixty-eight, the title is enclosed within its own special rectangle; in plate twenty-one, the picture border has only three sides to it instead of the usual four; and in plate twenty-four not one but two large rectangular frames enclose the picture border and title. From this description, it is clear that the Library of Congress Laroon as a whole has characteristics of both the Overton and Sayer editions. Furthermore, some of its individual plates actually possess Overton and Sayer characteristics simultaneously, such as their two contradictory systems of enumeration. The Library of Congress copy is also distinguished by a host of novel modifications, preparatory excisions, and experimental additions. These changes, most of which are partially conceived and/or randomly implemented, give evidence that the Library of Congress Laroon is a trial or proof impression taken from the plates when the ensemble was in transition from what it had been in known Overtons to what it was to become in Sayer. But if the Library of Congress proof impression was "in transition" from Overton to Sayer, which of the two publishers actually possessed the plates when it was run off? Six prints not considered until now are appended to this volume; their identity might tend to suggest that Sayer owned the copperplates at this time. Five of these (in sequence nos. 75-79) appear as an integral part of a Laroon for the first time in Sayer (three as title pages to its first three parts) and are the hallmark of this edition. The sixth (no. 80) is a modernized version of Overton's plate sixty-four; in its updated state it too debuts as an integral part of a Laroon in Sayer (plate fifteen). However, despite the fact that these six engravings tend to link the Library of Congress impression with Sayer, the evidence of the book as a whole argues persuasively that the copperplates were still in Overton's hands when it was run off. Nothing in the entire Library of Congress copy unequivocally identifies the plates as belonging to Sayer. His name appears nowhere on the engravings. By contrast, Henry Overton's publication line is still on the first title page and on plate thirteen. These two signatures of his possess special authority, for although a large number of other signatures were removed from the plates at this time, including Laroon's and Tempest's, Overton's was not. Had Sayer been preparing to issue his own edition, surely Overton's signature would have been the first to be banished. It seems likely then that at some point between 1711 and 1760 Overton began work on a new Laroon edition which he never issued and that it was he who was initially responsible for the plates added in the late eighteenth-century and not Sayer, as has been traditionally assumed. The argument concerning Overton's ownership of the copperplates at the time of the Library of Congress impression is strengthened by the meager chronological evidence of the engravings themselves. L.P. Boitard who designed the impression's seventy-fifth plate (which becomes the first title page to the Sayer edition) died in 1758, so the projected edition must have been planned before that date. 7 When Henry Overton died or became inactive is not known, but neither happened before 1758 when he issued a catalogue of writing books from his White Horse without Newgate address (Muir, rev. of Kaufrufe und Strassenhändler , 562). The Sayer edition of Laroon, to which I shall now return in resuming my chronological account of this suite of engravings, did not appear until around 1760. When Henry Overton (for whatever reason) gave up title to the copperplates of Laroon's Cryes , they passed into the hands of Robert Sayer. He reissued them with a title page (mentioned above) designed by the French engraver Boitard showing four children crowding around a magic lantern and its itinerant operator. The full title page of the Indiana copy of this edition reads, The Cries of London in Six parts. Being a Collection of Seventy two Humourous Prints, drawn from the Life by that Celebrated Artist Laroon, with additions &amp; Improvements by L. P. Boitard. L. P. Boitard Delint. Ravenet Sculp. Oh. You shall See, Vat you shall See. Printed for Robt. Sayer opposite Fetter Lane Fleet Street . 8 The existence of this edition is recorded by Karen Beall who designates it E 19 (Beall, p. 136). However it has nowhere been analysed or systematically described, and it has not been adequately differentiated from a later edition issued by R. H. Laurie (E 42). As the Boitard title page indicates, Sayer issued his Cries in six parts, each composed of twelve plates. Every one of these parts has its own title page. The title page to the second part ("No. 1. Part 2d. of the London Cries in 12 Prints.") is designated "Dainty Sweet Nosegays." Not in the Overton edition, this design shows a prettified country girl posing self-consciously in an idealized landscape. It is numbered "13" outside the picture frame in the upper right-hand corner of the page and is signed "F. Boucher Del: P. Angier Sculp." Like the title pages to the four remaining parts, it carries the publication line, "Printed for Robt. Sayer opposite Fetter Lane Fleet Street." The title page to the third part ("No. 1. Part the 3d. of the London Cries in 12 Prints"), also a new design, is called "Tiddy Diddy Doll, loll loll loll" and depicts the famous vender of gingerbread crying his wares. It is numbered "25" outside the picture frame. "No. 1. Part the 4th. of the London Cries in 12 Prints" (plate "37"), depicting a girl in a rustic setting, is entitled "Ground Ivy, Ground Ivy"; it is signed "Boucher del. J. Fougeron Sculp." The remaining title pages use designs from the Overton edition; all are numbered inside the picture frame in the upper right-hand corner. "No. 1. Part the 5th. of the London Cries in 12 Prints" (plate "49") employs "Pretty Maids Pretty Pins Pretty Women" and "No. 1. Part the 6th. of the London Cries in 12 Prints" (plate "61") uses "Crab Crab any Crabs." In addition to the three new designs introduced as title pages to parts one, two, and three, four other new plates appear in the Sayer edition. They are: "Buy my Curds and Whey" (plate "3"); "Buy my Great Eels, buy my live Eels" (plate "11"); "Diddle Diddle Diddle Dumplens ho" (plate "50"); and "Buy my Right Yorkshire Cakes, Buy my Muffins" (plate "72"). All are executed in a popular style, and although they are cruder than Laroon's pictures, they are in harmony with them in manner and content. The same cannot be said of "Dainty Sweet Nosegays" (plate "13") and "Ground Ivy, Ground Ivy" (plate "37"), both of which are executed in a refined, artificial court style very much out of harmony with the popular idiom of Laroon's prints. Muir has identified F. Newbery's Cries of London (1775) as "perhaps the first appearance of this very popular subject [London cries] in the children's market." 9 However, "Buy my Curds and Whey" (plate "3") and the new title page to the Sayer edition (plate "1"), both of which feature children very prominently, together with the exclusion of the "London Curtezan" (plate "51"), suggest that by 1760 the cries of London were perceived by at least one publisher as appealing to an audience composed primarily of children. A number of designs are carried over from the Overton Laroon but given new titles by Sayer. "The Celebrated Miss Wilkinson, The Female Wire Dancer" (plate "15") is actually "The famous Dutch Woman" (plate "64"); "The Bartholomew fair Musician" (plate "16") is "Merry Andrew on the Stage" (plate "53"); "Who rewards the Posture Masters" (plate "66") is "Clark the English Posture Master" (plate "68") and "Cook have you any Kitchen Stuff to Sell" (plate "68") is just a new title for "New River Water" (plate "16"). The use of the unmistakable water carrier for the vendor of kitchen stuff is yet another indication that this edition is something of a pastiche. The order of plates in the Sayer edition is entirely different from that of Overton with one exception; "A Bed Matt or a Door Matt" is numbered "6" in both. The order of the plates in the Sayer edition is identical to that which Beall gives for the Laurie edition with one exception; Sayer's "Ground Ivy, Ground Ivy," (plate "37") does not appear in Laurie; in its place is "Any bakeing peares" (Beall, p. 162). In part one of Sayer, the plates are numbered from "1" to "12" in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Thereafter, Sayer employs a dual numbering system; each part is numbered from "1" to "12" on the top lefthand side of the page and the entire publication is numbered on the top right-hand side from "13" to "72." The spelling of "Cryes" has been modernized in the title page and with it, many other words in the individual plates' titles. Virtually all the designs in Sayer have been retouched in some manner or other. Hats have been modernized or given a neater appearance. Head scarfs have been modified to reflect changes in prevailing fashion, and necklines have been similarly restyled. In a few cases, even the faces of the criers have been cosmeticized. The alterations which occur in "The merry Milk Maid" (plate "69") are good examples of the types of changes which appear throughout the Sayer plates. In this design, the milk maid's face has been purged of its common character and given a more refined, expressive look. Her hat has been modernized, and she wears a bonnet beneath it rather than a head scarf. Her dress has been redesigned to expose her neck and reveal her bosom. The former is decorated with a string of beads; the latter is adorned with a bouquet of flowers. Her feet are positioned closely together so that she now seems to pose delicately rather than walk. Her shoes have buckles rather than bows. These fashionable and elegant modifications and additions make the milk maid a more perfumed figure than she previously was, a figure more appropriate to the drawing room than to the street. Already declining, the London cries have begun to incorporate the picturesque and sentimental realism and the false theatricality managed to perfection by Francis Wheatley, a seminal artist in the history of modern bad taste and banality. No other edition of Laroon is known to have been issued in the eighteenth century, but the plates did change hands one more time, and in 1821 the last recorded edition of this ensemble was issued by R. H. Laurie under the title, The Cries of London in Six Parts. Being a Collection of Seventy Two Humourous Prints Drawn from the Life by that Celebrated Artist Laroon with Additions &amp; Improvements by L. P. Boitard. Published 8th Sept., 1821, by R. H. Laurie. No. 53, Fleet Street, London (Beall, p. 162). On the basis of Beall's detailed account, it is possible to distinguish this edition (E 42) from the earlier one published by Sayer (E 19). Although the title seems to indicate that Laurie made use of the same six part division as Sayer, he apparently employed a single system of enumeration for his engravings rather than a dual one. In enumerating his plates, Laurie did not assign numbers to his 37th ("Any bakeing peares") and 48th ("Fine writing ink"); Sayer's 37th ("Ground Ivy, Ground Ivy") and 48th ("Fine writing ink") plates are so designated. And Laurie changed the spelling of two words in the titles to plates "24" and "41" which now read respectively, "Old shoes for some broomes" (not "Shooes"), and "Oh raree shoe" (not "Show").</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Because of its aesthetic significance, its long life, and its wide distribution, Laroon's Cryes exercised more influence on the English tradition of itinerant trade depiction than any other series, foreign or domestic. Perhaps the most literal example of Laroon's influence occurs in those versions of the cries in which his designs have been miniaturized—a result of the increasing tendency to define this subject as the proper concern of illustrated children's books in the third quarter of the eighteenth century. A number of such miniatures are known to exist; one, entitled The Cries of London Engraved after ye Designs Made From Ye Life by M Lauron (E 12) published by John Bowles and measuring 10.5 x 7.5 cm., is in the Bodleian Library (Beall, p. 131). Another, The Cries of London; or, Child's Moral Instructor: for the Use of Schools, Private Families, Governesses, Tutors, &amp;c . . . Vol. II published by Edward Ryland and measuring approximately 10.5 x 7.5 cm., is in the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library. 10 The Morgan copy of Edward Ryland's plagiary of Laroon, until now the only known surviving copy of this children's book, is imperfect. It contains a frontispiece and twenty-nine numbered designs of what were probably thirty-one or thirty-two original engravings; plate II is missing. Happily two additional copies of this miniature have come to light, one in the Children's Book Collection in UCLA's Special Collections, and the other in the personal library of Elisabeth Ball, Muncie, Indiana, a collection begun by Miss Ball's father around the time Gumuchian's catalogue was published and based upon the library of Luke Owen. The title of the UCLA copy is The Cries of London; or, Child's Moral Instructor: for the Use of Schools, Private Families, Governesses, Tutors, &amp;c. Decorated with 32 Copper Plates, Elegantly Engraved; with a Moral and emblematical Description of each particular Story; Intended at once to make Instruction Pleasing; and unite Humour with Decency. To show the infant Mind what Vast Delight, On Virtue waits; and Vice's wretched Plight . The title page's imprint is missing from the UCLA copy and is here supplied from Elisabeth Ball's volume: Vol. II. London. Printed &amp; Sold by Edwd. Ryland Printer, in the Old Bailey. Price 1s. Plain, 2s Colour'd . Like the Ryland Cries in the Morgan, the Ball copy contains a frontispiece and twenty-nine of thirty numbered prints. Plate "II" is missing (as it is in the Morgan Ryland)—"The Sow Gelder" in the UCLA copy. The UCLA copy contains a frontispiece and twenty-nine of thirty numbered prints, lacking plate "XXX"—"Buy my fine singing Birds" in the Ball and Morgan volumes. The prints in this miniature are all somewhat crude and very literal reductions of Laroon's figures (accompanied by explications in verse) with the following exceptions which show little or no direct influence: "Mr. Yeates, in the Character of Launce, in the Gentlemen of Verona" (frontispiece); "XVII Buy a Lace, or a pair of Garters"; "XXII Any Card Matches, or Save-alls"; "XXIII Ripe Asparagus"; "XXVII Dainty sweet Nosegays." Most of Laroon's figures are reversed in Ryland and backgrounds are added in all designs. That the designs in this little book are based upon the Sayer rather than the Overton Laroon is clear from the inclusion of plate "XVI Hot Boild Pease, Hot" which is a reduction of plate fifty, "Diddle Diddle Diddle Dumplens Ho," plate "XXV Buy my Lobsters" which is a reworking of plate eleven, "Buy my Great Eels, buy my live Eels" and from the title of plate "XXVII Dainty sweet Nosegays." The influence of the Sayer edition also explains why so many of the figures in the Ryland miniature wear modernized costumes. A hitherto unrecorded edition of another miniature cries which has come to light in the Ball collection may properly be mentioned here. The title page of this children's book reads, The Cries of London Calculated to Entertain the Minds of Old and Young Illustrated in Variety of Copper Plates neatly Engrav'd with an Emblematical Description of Each Subject. Vol. III. London Printed for H. Turpin . . . . This edition is approximately the same size and format as the Ryland edition mentioned above, and its title page is engraved in the same cursive style. In addition, the Turpin engravings showing criers against detailed backgrounds explicated by short verses are executed in the same popular manner as The Cries of London; or, Child's Moral Instructor . However, none of the prints included in this children's book shows any direct influence from Laroon. The book contains fifteen engravings numbered consecutively from I to XVI; plate X is missing but not the verse explanation to it, "Buy all my fresh shell'd Wallnuts." Whether this book constitutes the third in a three-volume set in which Ryland's miniature is volume two or whether it belongs to a sibling trilogy cannot be asserted categorically, though the NCBEL (II, 1021) identifies The Cries of London; or, Child's Moral Instructor as a three-part series. While it is not possible to clear up this matter concerning the identity of volume three of Ryland's ensemble, it is possible to throw new light on volume one. The first volume of The Cries of London; or, Child's Moral Instructor is mentioned in the NCBEL and in the Pierpont Morgan's Early Children's Books and Their Illustration where it is described as "apparently having not survived." Through the assistance of Wilbur Smith of UCLA's Special Collections and Gerald Gottlieb of the Pierpont Morgan, I have been able to locate two copies of this rare volume. The first of these little books is in the personal library of Rowland Knaster in Ennismore Gardens, London. Its existence is verified in a letter to d'Alte Welch concerning the missing portion of the title page to UCLA's volume two; the letter is preserved in Los Angeles by Wilbur Smith. The second copy of volume one of Ryland's Cries is in the collection of the Opies in Hampshire, England. According to a description kindly provided me by Peter Opie, the text of the title page, the layout, and the engraving of this copy are identical to that of volume two, except for the quotation, which reads: "To wake the Soul by tender Strokes of Art, To raise the Genius and to mend the Heart. Pope." The numbering is of course, "Vol. I" and "London" is followed by a colon (:) not a point (.). According to Mr. Opie, his copy contains thirty numbered plates each depicting a cry, and a frontispiece which is theatrical. The final miniature inspired by Laroon's Cryes is Beall's E 16, [ Cries of London ] Engraved &amp; Sold by I Kirkins St. Pauls Church Yard (Beall, p. 135). A unique edition of this miniature is in the Lilly Library. This particular copy does not contain E 16's initial plate, "I Waltho Van Clutterbanck," but begins with a title page pasted on the inside of the front cover: "The Cryes of London Engraved and Sold by I. Kirk, in St. Paul's Church Yard. Also all sorts of English and Dutch Toys. Engraving of Seals in stone Steel or Silver Also Silver &amp; Copper Plates in the neatest manner and at the most Reasonable Rates." The Lilly copy contains twelve plates in all, four of which are not directly indebted to Laroon. The contents of these plates differ entirely from that given by Beall for E 16; they are: "a Longtail Pig, or a short tail Pig . . ."; "Buy a Mop, a pound Mop, or a Hair Broom"; "Who'll see my raree Show, my Gallantre Show"; "Buy my Quartern of Gudgeons, Buy my Plaice, Buy my Flounders"; "Hot Ginger-bread, Smoking Hot"; "Pray remember ye poor Prisoners"; "a Mutton Pie or an Eel Pie, come they are all Hott"; "Two a groat &amp; four for sixpence Whitings Come Buy my Whitings"; "Scotch Cloth a groat a Yard"; "Hot Gray Pease, Hot Hot"; "Holloway Cheese Cake"; and "a White Line, Jack Line, or a Cloaths Line." A number of other books whose lesser debts to Laroon have not been noticed deserves mention here. Virtually all the miniature Cries published by F. Newbery beginning around 1775 and continued by J. Harris fall into this category and bear the stamp of Laroon's iconography in varying degrees. One example from the numerous editions of these tiny volumes will suffice. An 1805 edition in the Ball collection published by Harris and not listed in Beall shows twenty-four of sixty-two plates inspired by Laroon. Two other miniatures, hitherto unrecorded, show the same kind of influence. In UCLA's The Jack-of-All-Trades, or the Merry Merry Cries of London: Improv'd. Describing the various Methods of Getting Money, in the Metropolis of this mighty Empire. Adorned with a Variety of Elegant Cuts, adapted to the Subject. London: Printed for Osborne and Griffin, and J. Mozley, Gainsborough (c. 1787), thirty-one of the miniature's seventy-two plates are bold plagiaries of designs in the Sayer edition of Laroon. And five of twenty-four plates in Miss Ball's Cries of London for the Instruction of Good Children Decorated with Twenty-four Cuts from Life (London, no date) also derive from Laroon. Among its population of bizarre and exotic characters (a significant number of whom are dismembered), T. L. Busby's Costume of the Lower Orders of London (E 40) contains one figure with a Laroon ancestry, "Match Girl," who springs from the figure in "Any Card matches or Savealls." The attractively colored, carefully executed plates in this volume were clearly intended for framing. A smaller, less finished version was also issued with the title The Cries of London Drawn from Life. London: 1823, Artists Depository . Published in three parts, it contains three identical title pages and twenty-three additional plates. The title page to part one of the copy in the Lilly Library is a reduction of the Boitard title page first published in its completed state in the Sayer edition of Laroon; however, this illustration now shows not four but two children crowding round a magic lantern. Nine figures not in the 1820 version appear in the 1823 edition, and some of the characters carried forward from the sibling version of 1820 have been retouched. Beall records a Cries (E 45) with the same title as the 1823 volume under discussion (Beall, p. 168). The UCLA copy she mentions carries the number "3" on the upper left-hand corner of its title page and is in fact the third part of the 1823 edition of the Cries of London Drawn from Life . Marcellus Laroon's influence is as extensive as the tradition of the cries itself. Both thrived until Victorian England's fear of the poor and the "outcast" made it increasingly difficult to celebrate or even record criers and itinerant vendors in an established artistic medium. At this point, they were delivered over to photography which, stripping them of the pelt of artistic life, rendered them as the sullen, lifeless shapes which illustrate the text of Henry Mayhew's London Labor and the London Poor , the first edition of which was published in book form in 1851. 11</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Pope's Dunciad , 1728 by David L. Vander Meulen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For more than a century the most puzzling bibliographical problem of Alexander Pope's satire The Dunciad , and the one which has stimulated the most spirited but not always the most pleasant debate, has been the question of which of the 1728 impressions was printed first. The issue first rose in the pages of Notes and Queries in the 1850's; the discussion reached its greatest intensity in the ripostes between R. H. Griffith and T. J. Wise early in this century; and in the 1950's the argument arrived at a stasis after a leading modern bibliographer, David Foxon, confirmed some of the earlier findings. Though a belief in the precedence of the 12° impression over the 8° has now become orthodox, it is an acceptance based mainly on the faith that a few scattered typographical variations are sufficient to reveal the printing order. In the pages that follow I shall attempt to establish the order of the impressions more conclusively, relying not on newly available but rather on freshly examined evidence, particularly that of running titles. This evidence, combined with the insights provided by resettings of portions of the text, also clarifies the printing of the three additional impressions in 1728 by the Dunciad 's first printer, James Bettenham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I William Thoms, the editor of Notes and Queries , made future discussion possible when he compiled the first checklist of versions of The Dunciad . 1 He cited three variants of the 1728 "first edition": A , a 12° with the first line reading "Book and the man . . ."; B , an 8° with that same first line; and C , a 12° beginning "Books and the man. . . ." He decided that, because of the size of the type page, A (a 12°) probably preceded B (the 8°), and that because of various "corrections" C (the second 12°) was the latest of the three. Thoms's assessment of the order of those early printings remained authoritative for over half a century. Then, in 1915, Reginald H. Griffith presented the initial results of his consideration of the problem. He challenged the existence of Thoms's A , an objection which subsequently has not been overturned, and he hesitantly suggested that variant C , the 12°, may have been printed before the 8°, item B. 2 By the time the first volume of his Alexander Pope: A Bibliography appeared in 1922, he had considered the matter more thoroughly. He admitted there that the evidence remained ambiguous, but after a lengthy examination of the variations between the two impressions he decided that the 12° probably came first and that the 8° was intended as a large-paper issue. Griffith's opinions were soon challenged by one of the most respected bibliographers of the day, Thomas J. Wise, who also had been studying the 1728 Dunciads . In the fourth volume (1923) of The Ashley Library he reinterpreted the ambiguous evidence that Griffith had cited and argued that the 8° came first and that it appeared in both large- and small-paper issues. 3 Griffith responded in an appendix to the second part of his bibliography (1927); while remaining tentative about his own hypotheses, he was unequivocal in rejecting Wise's conclusions. In 1931 Wise published the Pope section of his Ashley catalog as A Pope Library . Most of the material was reprinted verbatim, though Wise made numerous minor changes, especially where Griffith had challenged him, and he expanded his defense of the existence of a small-paper 8°—an argument based, ironically, on a copy which by then had passed to the Wrenn Library under the curatorship of Griffith in Austin, Texas. 4 But overall Wise merely reiterated his earlier arguments and ignored Griffith's specific objections. Griffith had the last word: drawing on some points raised in an article by W. K. Chandler, 5 he provided his definitive statement on the problem in 1938, the year after Wise's death. His tentativeness now disappeared: "the princeps of the Dunciad was the duodecimo." 6 The controversy then lay dormant for another twenty years until David Foxon revivified it. In a 1958 TLS essay 7 he examined several of the variations between the issues and decided that, for the parts of the book where they were found, the 12° had come first. Foxon's analysis has been influential as the persuasive argument of one of the foremost modern bibliographers of Pope, though Foxon himself noted that his insights did not yet solve all of the problems. The most valuable contribution of his study has proven to be not his conclusions but two features of his methodology. He was the first to use the Hinman Collator to examine copies of the book, and he was the first to acknowledge that priority for one part of a copy does not entail priority for all parts of that copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The relationships among the impressions of The Dunciad printed by James Bettenham can be seen most clearly on the accompanying chart, which lists the appearances of running titles and indicates resettings of the text. Both the determination of resettings and the identification of recurring running titles were made by comparison of copies on the Hinman Collator. The chart employs conventional methods of presenting the information whenever possible, but because no conventions exist for some of the features, an explanation of the chart is in order before proceeding to an analysis of the patterns. The four main columns of the chart represent the different impressions. As a way of condensing and clarifying the arrangement, the first column combines the 12° and 8° issues of the first edition; those issues are from the same setting of type throughout, and the running titles and their positions with respect to the text are identical. Combining them also eliminates the need to decide their order before the priority of one has been demonstrated. On the far left are lists of the page numbers and the signatures for the volumes. The signature letters in parentheses are those of the 8° issue of the first edition; those without the parentheses are for the remaining copies, all 12°. The pagination is the same in both formats. Across the top are the "edition" numbers according to the books themselves and also the designations given to these Dunciads in Foxon's English Verse 1701-1750 (1975). The poem was first printed in both duodecimo and octavo formats ( Foxon P764-765), with the octavo apparently intended as a large-paper issue. A 12° reimpression with the words 'The Second Edition' on the title page appeared next (P766); about one-and-a-half gatherings were reset. An additional gathering was reset in each of the following two reimpressions, both in 12° and calling themselves 'The Third Edition' (P767-768). The contents of the five impressions are virtually identical; in both formats the poetic text begins at the start of gathering B and continues to the end of the book. The collation formula for the first 12° impression also applies to those which follow: 12°: A-E 6 F 2 . That of the lone 8° is: 8°: a 4 b 2 B-G 4 H 2 . This chart of running titles ignores the preliminaries ($A, a , and b) which contain only a few running titles, all of which remain unaltered through the series of impressions. Inner and outer formes are not distinguished, for the half-sheets almost certainly were imposed for printing by the ordinary work-and-turn method. Thus, all pages of a gathering were on the press at the same time, and distinctions of inner and outer skeletons are meaningless. That method of imposition is difficult to prove equally well for each gathering, both because much of the evidence is available only in rare uncut copies and because by the nature of the evidence conclusive proof is available only for the other well-known way of printing half-sheets, the working of two different gatherings together. Nonetheless, over various copies of the 12° impressions at least two and sometimes more tests can be successfully applied to each of the half-sheets, and that evidence is always consistent with imposition for work-and-turn. Evidence for the lone 8° is scant, but it too indicates work-and-turn. Briefly, the evidence in the 12° is this. When two half-sheets are worked together, there ordinarily will be an approximately equal number of cut and deckled fore-edges on $1 and 6 and on 3 and 4; in work-and-turn, the fore-edges of $1 and 3 will always be deckled and $4 and 6 cut. In the sheets in the Dunciads , all examples are of the second group. Secondly, paper machined by the first method will, on the average, have an equal number of watermarks on $1, 3, 4, and 6; work-and-turn sheets will have them only on $3 and 4. All watermarks in these Dunciads are in fact on $3 and 4. Point holes follow a similar pattern. They appear with nearly equal frequency on $2, 3, 4, and 5 when two half-sheets are worked together but only on $2 and 3 in work-and-turn. In Dunciads , they occur only on $2 and 3. (In gathering A of the second edition they appear on $1 and 2; apparently the opposite end of the sheet, here containing the frontispiece, was intended as the cut-off. The position of the holes is nevertheless consistent with work-and-turn.) When two half-sheets are worked together, the first-forme impression will be consistent, unless the sheet was produced by concurrent printing; in work-and-turn, the first-forme impression will be evenly divided (in a sufficient number of examples) between the outer and inner formes of the gathering. The first-forme impressions in the Dunciads vary; that feature is again consistent with work-and-turn printing. The accumulated agreement of these indicators strengthens the suggestions of them individually; moreover, the absence of any counter evidence, in situations where half of the examples might be expected to vary, makes persuasive the claim that the 12° Dunciads were printed by the work-and-turn method of half-sheet imposition. Most of these tests cannot be applied to the 8°. Nonetheless, the first-forme impressions here also vary, suggesting that the 8° was also printed this way. The running titles themselves are represented on the chart by roman numerals—capitals for those on versos (here, 'The Dunciad.'), and lower case for rectos ('Book the First.', 'Book the Second.', or 'Book the Third.'). An asterisk before the running title number indicates that that running title is being used for the first time. Because the chart represents a completed assessment, it has not been possible to avoid indicating which of the two examples of the same running title in a particular copy appears first. But in order not to exclude evidence which conceivably could sustain a different interpretation, I have also noted second examples of running titles in a particular impression; I have enclosed the asterisks for them in parentheses. The number in parentheses following a roman numeral identifies another page on which that running title is used in that impression (on the chart, another page in the same column). An equals sign before a roman numeral indicates that that running title is identical with the one on that page in the previous impression. Under special circumstances, only part of the recto running title 'Book the. . . .' may be the same from one impression to the next. Sometimes the last word of 'Book the First', for example, is changed to 'Third' when the running title is reused later in the book. When the running title is subsequently restored to the beginning of the book in the following impression, a different setting of 'First' may be used. As a result, the running titles on a given page of two impressions may be identical only in part. To indicate this partial agreement, I have added the fraction ⅔ in parentheses following the equals sign. Furthermore, the presence of fractions incidentally indicates that some interruption occurred between the printing of those pages in the two impressions. I have not indicated the normal replacement of the last word in the running title within a single impression; such a shift can be assumed, and a record of it would merely clutter the chart. In a couple of cases I have been unable to determine with absolute certainty that certain running titles in the same impression are identical; I have then added a question mark behind the running title number or the cross-reference pagination. The chart also indicates resettings of the text. Although such changes are not inevitably linked with the running title pattern, the chart proves to be a useful place to record them, for every page of the poetic text is listed here. Moreover, there is in fact a frequent connection between textual resetting and the running titles, and the juxtaposition of the two patterns makes clear those links. The symbol used to indicate resettings is the number sign, #. Although it is a familiar sign, it is not used elsewhere in bibliographical description. Furthermore, its form may suggest its function; this symbol which indicates non-agreement of texts is similar to the "not equals" figure. The addition of a footnote is not here considered a resetting. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Earlier efforts to establish the order of the impressions have often depended on attempting to trace textual changes through the various printings. The argument which follows also depends on evidence generated by the juxtaposition of varieties of the text, but now it is primarily evidence of resettings and of the recurrence of running titles. For ease in reference I have used the edition designations indicated on the title pages of the various impressions. The term edition is not strictly accurate, for although each impression has some material reset, the new portion is never enough to qualify the book as a new "edition" by customary standards. Despite that slow change, however, most of the poetic text has been reset once or more by the end of the five impressions. The core of the argument for establishing the priority of one of the impressions of the "first edition" is quite simple. Two features of these impressions are basic: that the settings of their headlines and type pages are the same, and that a basic set of running titles which appears in these impressions is reused elsewhere in them as well as in the other printings of 1728. The identity of the text and of the sequence and positions of the running titles throughout the 12° and 8° indicates that individual sections of the two impressions were printed without any intervening dismantlement other than that required for imposing the pages in a new format. But because some of the headlines eventually were removed so that the running titles could be reused elsewhere in the book, it is evident that the pattern of printing was not all of one of the formats followed by all of the other. Rather, there had to be some alternation between the formats. The argument proceeds with the establishment of the temporal relationship between the printing of the sections of the first edition which use the same set of running titles. For the moment the distinction between the two formats is not important, for we know that, whatever the order of the formats with respect to each other, the corresponding sections in the two were printed consecutively. In the two impressions of the first edition, the group of running titles used for pages 1-16 is also used for pages 37-48. In the second edition, pages 1-16 have been reset and their running titles changed from those in the first, but pages 37-48 are identical both in their text and in the order and position of the running titles. Variant press figures confirm that pages 37-48 are in fact from a separate impression rather than from an overprinting of the first edition. It is virtually certain that of the two parts of the first edition in which the same set of running titles appears, the part which corresponds precisely with the parallel section of the second edition was printed closer in time to the second edition than the part which is not identical. Thus, pages 37-48 were printed later than pages 1-16. If the opposite had been true, that is, if pages 37-48 were printed first and then their running titles transferred to pages 1-16, where they appear in a different sequence, then only a mind-boggling coincidence could explain how the running titles were rearranged in exactly the same order and position with respect to the text when they were transferred to pages 37-48 of the second edition. Pages 1 through 36 of the first edition contain the original appearances of the running titles which are used throughout the 1728 Dunciads . Some of these—the ones in the first sixteen pages—are, as we have just seen, reused later in the first edition, but the rest are not. In normal printing house practice, the compositor set running titles for each page as he went along when existing ones were not available. 9 Because the running titles as well as the other parts of the skeleton were subsequently reused by being transferred to other formes, it was logical to stop the series of new running titles at the end of a gathering. In the first Dunciad , the break between new and reused running titles occurs after page 36—midway through gathering F in the 8°, but at the end of D in the 12°. If the compositor had prepared the gathering which includes page 36 for initial imposition in 8°, he would have set new running titles for the first four pages and then used four from earlier gatherings to complete the forme. A simpler explanation, and one which fits better the ordinary pattern of compositorial work, is that he composed the running titles for a 12° imposition, preparing sufficient new ones to complete the gatherings he was working on. By that reasoning, pages 25-36 would have first been imposed and printed as gathering D of the 12°. Likewise, because the presence of reused running titles matches exactly the extent of gathering E in the 12°, those pages, 37-48, were most likely first imposed for that 12° format instead of for part of F and all of G in the 8°. 8° E (pp. 25-32) would thus have been printed after 12° D, and 8° G (pp. 41-48) after 12° E. 8° F (pp. 33-40), which includes pages from both 12° D and E, would have followed both. Given that set of relationships, two types of sequences are possible: either these two 12° formes were printed before any of the three 8° ones, or else after the first of these two 12° gatherings was printed, the one complete 8° gathering within it was machined before the other 12° forme. I am inclined to think that all of the 12° preceded all of the 8° here; in light of the press figures in these sections, the other sequences would mean that at some point the printers chose to keep a press waiting while the 12° pages were reimposed for the 8° rather than to print the remaining 12° forme which could have been imposed while the first was printing. Although oscillation between the formats is possible, the succession of all of one by all of the other is more probable for this section. There is, moreover, some basis for determining the relative order of 12° D and E. It is reasonable that the pages which continue the series of new running titles were printed before those with reused ones; if so, 12° D preceded 12° E. Gathering E of the 12° employs running titles first used on pages 1-16— that is, B and part of C in the 12°, or all of B and C in the 8°. The running titles in 12° E would have been collected from the later of the two impressions of those early pages. Because they correspond exactly with an integral division in the 8° volume, they seem to have been drawn from the 8°. In contrast, those running titles of 12° E match all of B but only the first four pages of C in the 12°. It would have been another amazing coincidence for those particular running titles from 12° C to be selected for use in 12° E. It is apparent, therefore, that because the running titles of 8° B and C were transferred to 12° E, all gatherings of the 12° of which 8° B and C form a part must have been printed before the 8° ones; in other words, both 12° B and C preceded 8° B and C. Because pages 1-24 (12° B and C) were thus first imposed for 12°, gathering 12° C was almost certainly printed before 8° D (pp. 17-24) as well. Furthermore, it is likely that the running titles reused for pages 37-48 were the first ones that became available. If so, then 8° B and C were run off before 8° D. The running titles in the closing pages of the book, 12° F or 8° H (pp. 49 ff.), remain the same throughout the 1728 impressions and offer no clues for determining priority. The imposition order for those final pages is conclusive from earlier investigations, however. Foxon observes that in the 12° the direction line on page 49 lies immediately below the footnote, while in the 8° and in the second edition a lead has been inserted between them. Because these pages of the second edition were not reset, page 49 apparently is closer in time to the 8° than the 12° ("Two Cruces," p. 52). Chandler made two useful discoveries about the same gathering ("First Edition," pp. 68-69). On page 51, line 273 in the 12° and in most copies of the 8° has the phrase ' B --- longsole judge'. But a copy of the 8° in the Wrenn Library at Texas as well as all copies of the second edition have ' B—n longsole judge'. Later on the page, line 277 in the 12° has the word 'townlongs-mens'; both the 8° and the second edition drop the long s in favor of 'towns-mens'. For this gathering as well, therefore, the 12° preceded the 8°. Traditional printing house procedures as well as patterns within this particular work provide some basis for speculating that gatherings b 2 and H 2 of the 8° were printed as a single half-sheet. It obviously would have been easiest for the printer to combine them and end up with a whole number of half-sheets for the book. The other gatherings of the poetic text were printed in alphabetical sequence; that pattern, coupled with the usual practice of preliminaries being printed last, would support a chronological link between the two quarter-sheets as well as suggest that they were printed after the section that ends with page 48 had been completed. The fact that new running titles were produced for pages 49-51 does not weaken the theory; it would have been logical to compose these three separately rather than to plunder the set of a full gathering which could otherwise be transferred as a unit to another forme. Paper evidence also suggests some connection between the beginning and end of the book. Of the four varieties of "BF"-marked paper here, two occur almost exclusively in gatherings B-E, and two in F-H and a-b. Finally, the evidence of point holes, deckle edges, tranchefiles, and watermarks reveals that the quarter-sheets were machined as they would be for joint imposition in a half-sheet: the first leaf of one gathering (H) always falls at the outer edge of the full sheet, and the first leaf of the other (b) on the inside. The priority of the imposition of the rest of the preliminaries remains problematical. The running titles for this section, "The Publisher to the Reader," are invariant throughout the five 1728 impressions, and no typographical variations appear in the text. Certain speculations in light of what is known about the rest of the book are nonetheless possible. The pattern in the other gatherings immediately suggests that here too the 12° preceded the 8°. It is true, as McKerrow points out, that "an edition in which the signatures are all of one alphabet, beginning with A and proceeding regularly, is likely to be later than an edition in which the preliminary leaves have a separate signature." That would argue for the priority of the 8°. But he also says that "A" was often saved for the preliminaries and that a preliminary sheet signed A when the text begins on B tells us "nothing at all." 10 According to the signature pattern, then, the 12° could have been the first impression, and the preliminaries could have been composed and printed at the customary time, after the rest of the book. If the pages that were distributed first were the ones that had been printed first, we have another hint that the preliminaries were not worked at the start of the press run; they remained intact, for use in the second edition, while the equivalent of 8° B, C, and some of D were distributed and then reset. With the actual sequence of these impressions now in mind, it is interesting to take another look at earlier arguments about the priority of editions. The spirited debate to a large extent turned on the question of whether a clearly corrupt or a correct form of the text came first. An important group of variations consisted of those that either could have been caused by type movement when the format was changed or else might have been corrected at that point. All but one of the variations, it turns out, were from good to bad. The extensive type movement on the opening pages of the text, along with the dropping of the 'S' of 'BOOKS'; the two raised letters in the footnote on page 5; the removal of the exclamation point after the catchword on page 8; and the dropping of the final letter in the catchwood 'As' on page 9 all resulted when the poem was reimposed for octavo. Only one error of this kind, the omission of the final letter in the catchword 'This' on page 29, seems to have resulted from a mistake in composition (or from the dislodging of the letter early in the press run) and to have been corrected for the second impression. Yet while the octavo text is inferior at these points, it contains seven corrections of material whose states are independent of type movement caused by the opening of the formes. The pattern of changes thus suggests that sheets of the 12° impression served as the proof sheets for the text of the 8°, with the appropriate revisions made between impressions. The 8° seems to have received no separate proofing; that omission allowed the errors caused by type movement to enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Features which are instrumental in determining the printing order of the first two impressions of the 1728 Dunciad , particularly resettings of the text and the recurrence of running titles, also provide helpful insights into the production of the following three impressions. The most important principle involved in interpreting such evidence is this: when a group of running titles appears twice within the same work, the group which matches the corresponding part of the preceding impression was printed first. In these particular cases that principle is corroborated by two probabilities involving resettings of the text: the type distributed first is likely to have been the type which was used first, and pages from standing type are likely to have been printed before those which were reset. 11 Thus, sections for which the setting is identical with the corresponding part of the previous impressions are likely to have been printed before the sections that are reset. The remaining impressions of the 1728 Dunciad —the "Second Edition" and the two impressions bearing the designation "Third Edition"—are all in duodecimo. The discussion which follows deals only with the bulk of their poetic text, gatherings B through E. The preliminaries (gathering A) and the final three pages of text (in F 2 ) retain the identical running titles and text and therefore, as in the first two impressions, provide little evidence for priority. As the chart shows, pages 1-18 of the second edition are newly set, with running titles which do not match those on the corresponding pages of the first edition. Pages 25-48, or gatherings D and E, are usually from standing type and identical in their running titles. The only exception is D4 v (p. 32), where the text is reset and the running title is taken from elsewhere in the book. Running title XVI , which appeared on that page in the previous edition, never shows up again. Although line 325 is now wrongly identified as 525, there are no other textual variations between page 32 here and in the first edition; the page was probably pied between impressions. The pattern of running titles and resettings clearly indicates that gatherings D and E were closest in time to the first edition, and thus before B and C, where the running titles reappear. Moreover, E came before D; the running title used for the apparently pied D4 v was taken from E4 v , where it also occurred in the first edition. The running titles from D were then transferred to B, retaining their sequence for the most part. B1 r required no running title, so the one from D1 r could not be used in the parallel spot in B. Instead the compositor placed it on the adjacent page in the forme, B6 v . That was wrong. B6 v should have had a running title from another verso, one which indicated the book number. The error remained in edition 3a, where gathering B employed the same running titles and text, though it was corrected in 3b, where the headlines occur in a different sequence and where the text is reset. The appearance of the anomalous running title on B6 v of the second edition meant that there was no place for the one that had occupied a parallel spot in the group being transferred to B. As a result, running title XVIII (from D6 v ) was apparently discarded; it does not recur in this or any subsequent edition. Gathering C is the most complicated one of the second edition. Some of the text was reset, and some imposed from standing type. Some running titles were newly composed, others were transferred from elsewhere in the book, and still others were received with the standing type of the previous edition. Gathering C in the first 12° edition contained the type used for part of 8° C and all of 8° D. Whereas the running titles of 8° B and C were transferred to a point later in the first edition and those pages of text distributed, the running titles of 8° D were not needed elsewhere. As a result, 8° D and its running titles seem to have remained standing longer, with consequences for the second edition. Pages 21, 22, and 24 (that is, C5 and C6 v ) with their running titles were transferred intact. The running title and much of the text of page 20 were also transferred, though the irregular correspondence of the text to that of the first edition suggests that it may have been salvaged from partially pied type. To make room for a footnote on page 22 in the second edition, the compositor moved the final two lines of text from 22 to the top of 23 (C6 r ). Those lines, as well as possibly a few other segments of the text, are thus from previously prepared text, but most of the page is reset. The running title is changed; the fact that, unlike its original companions, the running title used on this page in the first edition never appears again suggests that it—and the rest of the page—were pied. One opportunity for the introduction of such disorder would have been, of course, the point at which the two lines were transferred. In contrast to those pages from 8° D, the ones that correspond to 8° C (pp. 13-16, or C1-2 in the second edition) are all reset, as are pages 17 and 18 (C3). Running titles from E of the second edition are used on most of the newly set pages in C. Perhaps distribution of E had already started when those running titles were needed, for while some new ones occur here (pp. 18 and 19; 3 v and 4 r ), not all of those which should have been available from E are used. Those unused ones, moreover, never again appear in the series of Dunciads . In at least one case, however, a "new" running title in C is similar enough to one in E ( XX on p. 18 resembles VIII on p. 48) to suggest that the earlier example persists, albeit with a couple of sorts or the internal spacing changed. Page 15 (B2 r ) is the beginning of Book II and does not contain an actual running title, but the new setting of part of the division head ('Book the Second.') here and in the following impression is later used as one. Therefore it is included in the chart, but it is placed in brackets. The pattern in the first of the two third editions is less complicated. The running titles and text of gatherings B and C are identical to the second edition. E, which was one of the first parts of the second edition printed and very likely also distributed, is completely reset in edition 3a. The running titles in E are those from C, though in a different sequence. The division heading from C2 r now assumes the status of a full-fledged running title on E1 r . The running titles in D are from B; here the order is the same, except that the running title on 1 r , a leaf that had none in B, comes from 6 v , a leaf that appears without a running title in D. D6 v could do without one because it contains a division heading, the start of Book III. Moving the running title from B6 v also removed the anomaly of the incorrect one which had been introduced in the second edition. Although the running titles in D are the same in the second and third editions, that parallel is fortuitous. Those from D of the second edition had been moved to B of that edition; that arrangement of text and headlines was reimpressed for the third edition, and then the running titles were moved to gathering D of that edition. Apart from that trail of the movement of the running titles, the clearest evidence that D in the third edition was not printed directly from the setting of D in the second is that in recto running titles the book number is sometimes from different settings of type. When the running titles were first moved to an earlier place in the second edition, the word 'Third' was replaced by 'First'; when they were again moved to D in the third edition, 'Third' was reinserted. It thus became possible for the bulk of one running title to be identical with another one but for the final word to be from a different setting. As additional evidence that some interruption has taken place between the printing of the second and third editions of D, the spacing between the running title and text on a given page often varies from one edition to the other. The features of running titles and settings of the text in the final Bettenham printing, the second one to be called "Third Edition," are similar to those of the previous impressions. Gatherings D and E have the identical text and running titles as the comparable sections of edition 3a, in which they were the last gatherings printed. Because running titles from both D and E appear elsewhere in 3b in positions that do not match 3a, D and E were evidently the first sections of 3b to be printed. The running titles of B, which was newly composed, and C, printed from standing type, are for the most part from D. In C, the running titles on leaves 1, 2 v , 3-5, and 6 r follow the sequence of D. C2 r has no running title, so title xii from D2 r is not used. On the other hand, D6 v had no running title to provide for C6 v , so the compositor instead took the one from E6 v . The running titles from C were then moved to B. Because in B page 1 r rather than 2 r has no running title, the one from C1 r is moved to B2 r . Most of those in B are the same as those in the previous edition; the set of 3a B was moved to 3a D, it recurred as 3b D, and then moved to 3b C and up to 3b B. But as with gathering D in editions 2 and 3a, the book number in recto running titles is a different setting. It is possible that the movement of running titles in 3b might have been from D to B to C rather than D to C to B. That would mean that as the compositor transferred the running titles from D to B, he departed from his careful practice of transferring running titles to identical positions in B in the single case of B2 r , where he would have inserted the one from D1 r rather than the expected D2 r . The consistency of the rest of the pattern makes that seem improbable. Moreover, the order D-C-B fits with what might be expected concerning the printing order of a forme of standing type and a newly set one: it is likely that the standing C was worked before the reset B. The resetting of B also provides a clue about the printing of the early gatherings of 3a. If the one of two formes which was distributed first had also been run off first, then 3a B was printed before 3a C. But in 3b, in any case, it seems that the actual order was indeed D-C-B. The neat identities between gatherings in adjacent impressions raise the possibility that portions of the books were produced not in the way described here but by overprinting: as the presswork for one of the "editions" was nearing completion and the need for another one became evident, extra copies of the first could have been machined at once instead of being separately impressed for the next issue of the poem. But evidence from changed ornaments, press figures, and paper indicates that such was not the case for any gathering in any of these Bettenham impressions. In summary, then, the printing of The Dunciad of 1728 most likely proceeded in the following order: Edition 1 (12° and 8°): 12° B and C (pp. 1-24), or roughly the first half of the poem; 8° B, C, and D, with D probably last; 12° D and E (pp. 25-48), with E probably immediately after D; 8° E, F, and G. The sequence of the remaining sections of the first edition is not as clear. Certainly 12° F was printed before 8° H, and very likely 8° H and b were produced together. It is also possible that both the final gathering and the preliminaries were printed after the rest of the book. What is evident, however, is that the printing alternated between the 12° and the 8°, and that each section of the poetic text of the 12° was run off before the corresponding part of the 8°. The point at which gatherings A and F were printed in the subsequent impressions is not apparent either, apart from inferences generated by the pattern within the rest of each impression. But the sequence for B-E, or the bulk of the poetic text, seems to be as follows: Edition 2: E; then D; then C and B (with C probably first). Edition 3a: B and C (with B probably first); then D and E (with D probably first). Edition 3b: D and E; then C; then B. In each of those later impressions at least one gathering was reset, according to the following pattern: Edition 2: B, most of C (1-3, some of 4 v , and most of 6 r ), and D4 v . Edition 3a: E. Edition 3b: B. 12</field>

The TLS was so greatly impressed that it continued its praise of the Pope section a second week, justifying the special treatment on the grounds that the bibliography was "so much in advance of anything which has hitherto appeared" (22 May 1924, p. 328; the first review appeared on 15 May, p. 303). Neither TLS article mentioned Griffith's work. 4 The trouble between Wise and Griffith may have been presaged in 1920. When the Wrenn collection was moved to Austin, Wise helped Wrenn's son compile a catalog of it ( A Catalogue of the Library of the late John Henry Wrenn [1920]). William Todd has indicated that these numbered copies were assigned according to the honor intended to their recipients. Wise, his family, and his friends received the early copies; Griffith, who had been crucial in obtaining the collection for Texas, was far down the list and got number 71 in the edition of 120 copies ("Unfamiliar Collections, II: The Wrenn Library," Library Chronicle of the University of Texas , NS 8 [1974], 73-81). 5 "The First Edition of the Dunciad ," MP , 29 (1931), 59-72. 6 P. 582 in "The Dunciad Duodecimo," Colophon , NS 3 (1938), 569-586. 7 "Two Cruces in Pope Bibliography," 24 Jan. 1958, p. 52. 8 My use of the Hinman Collator has revealed a different pattern of resettings from that which Foxon's catalog records on the basis of visual inspection.

      <field name="fulltext">I The Earliest (?) Key to The Spiritual Quixote . Richard Graves's The Spiritual Quixote (1773), it is well known, is to some extent a roman à clef, with no little admixture of autobiography. Hitherto, the first key to some of the characters' real identity was held to be that published in John Wilson Croker's 1831 edition of Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson (IV, 524-525). The key was given him by his "venerable and amiable friend, Lord St. Helens," the son of William Fitzherbert, and contains the following identifications, the characters' names appearing first: Sir William Forrester/Mr. Fitzherbert; Lady Forrester/Mrs. Fitzherbert; Lord----/L.P. Meynell, Esq. of Bradley Park, Mrs. F's father; Kitty Forrester/Catherine Fitzherbert, afterwards Mrs. Bateman; Miss Sainthill/Miss Hill Boothby; Colonel Rappee/Colonel Deane; Bob Tench/Mr. Nicholas Thornhill; and the Young Templar/Mr. C. Pratt, afterwards Lord Camden. "Even the inferior characters," Croker continues, "were drawn from the life," so that the "jacobite barber was one Daniel Shipley; George, the butler, was John Latham; and Molly, the lady's maid, was Mary Etches, afterwards married to Latham; Wildgoose, the hero, was supposed to be a portrait of Mr. Graves's own brother." 1 My present purpose is to examine what is probably the first key, one published in the Gentleman's Magazine (hereafter GM ) in September, 1808, pp. 774-5. Prior to this it may be well to point out that the identification of the Foresters with the Fitzherberts had been made in 1804 in the GM 's obituary notice of Grave's death (p. 1166). There, too, Mr. Rivers was identified as the author himself, and most scholars have been content to accept these identifications. Perhaps it will be well to quote Hill (see note 1) on the whole matter of these identifications. Noting that those given by Croker were mostly of minor characters and "no longer possible to verify" he went on to write, "It is also perfectly fair to say that in most of these cases verification would not add much to one's appreciation of the narrative. Some comment, however, may profitably be made" (p. 59). Hill accepted the identifications of the Fitzherberts, Miss Hill Boothby, and Charles Pratt and went on to "things of greater importance," i.e., the narratives of Mr. Graham and of Mr. Rivers. Here, too, it should be mentioned that Clarence Tracy, editor of the Oxford 1967 edition of The Spiritual Quixote , is inclined to be sceptical of the identifications and concerns himself in his Introduction largely with the autobiographical element in the novel (p. xx). Tracy points out, however, that in the 1808 edition of the novel "Sir W. K." (Book X, Chapter xxii) becomes "Sir W. Keyte" p. (495). The identification of Sir W. K. in the 1808 edition may serve as a bridge to the list in the September 1808 GM , for there Sir W. K. is identified as "Sir William Kyte of Horton, near Campden, co. Gloucester; after whose death the estate was purchased by Mr. Dudley Ryder, father of Lord Harrowby." The GM index of names for 1787-1818 records the death of a George Kyte in 1791, and there is an editorial note that reads, "The name is properly Keyt, near relations of a family, till lately, of great note and respectability in Gloucestershire" (p. 1167). This is corroborated by the Victoria County History of Gloucestershire , volume VI. Sir William Musgraves's Obituary Prior to 1800 . . . (1900), III, 368, sub Keyt, records the death of "William (Sir), Hertfordshire, 6 March 1757, age 72 (See an accot. of his death in the 'Hist. of Jeffery Wildgoose,' iii. 164)." The GM obituary has him as "Rev. Sir Wm. Keate, Bart. aged 72, at Digby, near Walling, Hertfordshire" (1757, p. 142). Hence, one has Keyte, Kyte, Keyt, and Keate. The likeliest candidate is he of the 1808 GM , for he was of Horton, near Campden, which is three miles south of Mickleton, Graves's birthplace. Indeed, the GM obituary notice of Graves's death identifies Mickleton as "near Campdon, co. Gloucester." However, the only William Kyte I have found was of Shireborn, Gloucestershire; his son Joshua attended Oxford University and died in 1788 ( Alumni Oxonienses ). "Shireborn" is modern "Sherborne." Of negligible weight is the fact that Sir Dudley Ryder (see DNB ), who was said to have purchased Sir William's estate, was the father of Nathaniel, first Baron Harrowby. This first identification must be judged, in part, by what evidence can be gleaned from the others in the 1808 GM list. "W. F.," who sent the key to the GM in 1808, wrote, "I send you a key to the Spiritual Quixotte . I had it from a respectable quarter, and have reason to suppose it genuine. If you have not already noticed it [had it appeared elsewhere?], perhaps you may deem it worthy a place in your Magazine." According to the list, Geoffrey Wildgoose and Miss Townshend were "Feigned characters," a view shared by Hill, although some of Wildgoose's traits are taken from Graves's brother Charles. W. F. was right on Rivers and the Fitzherberts, but he could have got those identifications from the 1804 GM obituary notice of Graves's death. Aside from those already mentioned and that of Sir William Kyte there are thirteen other identifications. I have been unable to discover anything about the following, the characters' names appearing first: Lavinia/Mrs. E. Lowe of Worcester; Mrs. Booby/Formerly Miss Brace; Mr. Hammond/Mr. Bernard Kirkman; Mr. Gregory Griskin/The Rev. Mr. Boyce, Rector of Berkeswell in Staffordshire; Molly J----n/Molly Johnson, lately dead; and Jerry Tugwell/William Taylor, a shoemaker at Mickleton. Jerry Tugwell was, of course, a shoemaker, so that W. F.'s last identification, if true, lends something to our information about Graves's "sources," if that be the right word. 2 What is most remarkable about W. F.'s key is its identifications of Miss Eutricia Smith, daughter of the Rev. Mr. Smith of Mickleton, in the county of Gloucester" as Ophelia of the novel and of "Mr. Bartholomew, of Alder, near Reading," as Mr. Woodville. Graves "received his earliest instruction from a Mr. Smith, curate of Mickleton and Vicar of Toddington. That gentleman had a daughter named Eutricia" (Hill, p. 62). Further, about 1744 Graves "took up his clerical duties in the parish of Aldworth in Berkshire, where he became a boarder in the household of Edward Bartholomew" (Hill, p. 65), whose daughter Lucy he married. Lucy was fifteen when Graves moved to Aldworth; Charlotte Woodville of the novel was "hardly fifteen" when Mr. Rivers went to reside with the family. Alder, by the way, is an alternate or variant spelling of Aldworth or Alworth. It is against the background of these facts, and some complementary ones to be discussed, that the key in the GM must be judged. For example, Mr. Clayton is alleged to be "The late Morgan Graves, ESQ. of Mickleton, who married the daughter of James Walwyn, ESQ." Morgan Graves was Richard's brother; James Walwyn, ESQ. a banker, died in 1800 ( GM , p. 1209) shortly after the death of his daughter. What is more, the GM key identifies "the late James Walwyn of Longworth, co. Hereford" as the original of Mr. Aldworth in the novel. (Note that Mr. Bartholomew, the original of Mr. Woodville, was of Aldworth, almost surely suggesting the name Mr. Aldworth for one of Graves's characters.) One more identification strengthens the impression that W. F.'s "respectable quarter," the source of his key, knew quite a bit about the Graves family, i.e. that the Countess of Huntingdon was Lady Sherwood of the novel, for Hill (p. 41) is authority for an association between Lady Huntingdon and Charles Graves, Richard's brother who is, in part, the original of Geoffrey Wildgoose. The next identification raises a curious problem, inasmuch as Mr. Wylmot is supposed to be "the late Rev. Mr. Walker, Rector of Whitchurch, Oxfordshire," and the only recorded Mr. Walker, Samuel in this instance, who was rector of Whitchurch, held this living from 1723-28 ( Alumni Cantabrigienses ), and would hardly be described as "the late" Mr. Walker. In any event, there was a Mr. Walker who was rector of Whitchurch in Oxfordshire, six miles northwest of Reading, "near" which was the residence of Mr. Bartholomew, the original of Mr. Woodville. In Book VI, Chapter XIV, Mr. Rivers took his wife, the former Miss Woodville, to dine with Mrs. and Mrs. Wymot, "whose seat in the country was not many miles distant from Miss Woodville's father's." W. F. states that the original of Mr. Graham, now held to be Graves himself, was "the late Dr. Cholmondeley, fellow of Magdalen college, Oxon. His sister married Sir William Kyte." This is particularly interesting, since he also identified Sir Willam Kyte as the Sir. W. K. of the novel. However, the only Cholmondeley I have found who remotely resembles the above is John Cholmeley (a variant spelling of Cholmonedley), a fellow of Magdalen. 3 But he had no doctoral degree and he died in 1814, six years after the key in the GM . Nor is there any record in the indexes to the names in the GM for the years 1731-1818 of the marriage of a Miss Cholmondeley (or Cholmeley) to a Sir William Kyte. Two explanations offer themselves: W. F.'s information was inaccurate here, as in a few other places, or available records simply have omitted such events as the Cholmondeley-Kyte marriage and the death of the "Dr." Cholmondeley (Cholmeley) whose sister Sir William Kyte married. What is more, the same is true of the identification of the "Rev. Mr. Boyce, Rector of Berkeswell in Staffordshire" as the original of one of the most memorable minor characters in the novel, "Mr. Geoffrey Griskin, the little fat Staffordshire clergyman" who figures in Mr. Rivers's narrative (see Book VI, Chapter XIX). (Modern Berkswell is in Warwickshire on the border with Staffordshire.) Richard Boyse is the only possible candidate, but he became Rector of Berkswell on 25 April 1713 ( Alumnis Oxonienses ), a date early enough as to suggest the existence of another Rector of Berkswell named Boyce, or a remarkable, but by no means improbable, tenure on the part of Richard Boyse. Graves began writing his novel in 1757, but he was already forty-two years old; hence Richard Boyse's candidacy for the original of Gregory Griskin is chronologically possible. Ultimately the question of the value of the GM key must be raised. First of all, one of the most important identifications, that of Mr. Bartholomew of Aldworth as the original of Mr. Woodville and the whole matter of Graves's marriage to Lucy Bartholomew has hitherto rested on the unsupported statement of a work published in 1866. In his Remains in Verse and Prose (p. 96), the Rev. Francis Kilvert made the Bartholomew/Woodville identification, but gave no authority for it, although it is clear from the rest of his essay on Graves that he knew the key that had been given Croker. Indeed, he writes that "there is extant a key, assigning each of [the principal characters] to its original" (p. 108), but does not elaborate on the statement. The GM key not only makes the first Bartholomew/Woodville identification but also the first Utricia Smith/Ophelia identification, as well as a number of lesser ones. To be sure, there are discrepancies or seeming discrepancies in a few of the identifications, and some would seem to defy verification, but there are more clues than there are false trails. If the GM key inspires credence, and it should certainly inspire some, the autobiographical element in the novel is shown to be greater than has been realized and the purely fictive element reduced. In short, if The Spiritual Quixote is accepted as a minor classic, as its champions claim, any light upon the mode of its composition should be welcomed. 3a</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The Shenstone Canon William Shenstone's abilities as a landscape gardener have been said to be greater than his talents as a poet, but it is equally true to say that his talents, though minor, were on a par with, and even exceeded, those of many of his contemporaries. Yet some of these contemporaries, minor poets also, have commanded more attention of late years than he. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the canon of his poetry has been fixed since 1918 when fifteen unpublished poems and five unpublished inscriptions were added to it. 4 Actually, four of the supposed "unpublished" poems had appeared in the GM , another instance of the neglect of this invaluable source. The poems, in order of their appearance in the GM , are: 1. Inscription for a Medicinal Fountain in my Farm (1794.ii,1037). 2. For a Beech (1795.ii,905). 3. Stanzas, On the Discovery of the Cheltenham Waters by Pigeons (1819.i,353). 4. The Roses Reconciled (1820.i,350). The poems, Inscription and For a Beech , were submitted by Δ. π; the Stanzas , by D. Parkes of Shrewsbury. The Roses Reconciled was printed without any introductory matter, simply as one of Shenstone's "Juvenile Poems." Equally unnoted are three poems, two inscriptions, and an eight-line addition to a poem by another, all in the GM . Again, a list will simplify matters. 1. Unnamed: "In Broome so neat, in Broome so clean" (1793.ii,790). Submitted by Δ. π. from Salop. 2. To the Memory of W. G. Parish-clerke at Broome (1798.i,467). Submitted from Shrewsbury. 3. A civil censure on the frivolous excuses made by many females, when solicited in company to favour their friends with a song (1827.ii,34). Submitted by Δ. π. from Shrewsbury. 4. Unnamed: Latin inscription for his housekeeper. Mrs. Arnold (1797.i, 102). Submitted by D. S. P. from Hales Owen. 5. Unnamed: Latin inscription "to a favorite little animal of the Poet's" (1827.ii,34). Submitted by Δ. π. from Shrewsbury. 6. Eight lines added to a poem by A. F. of Quinton entitled Verses Written at The Leasowes, May 19, 1759 (1812.i,216). Submitted by A. F. It will not have gone unremarked that of the nine pieces listed D. S. Parkes of Shrewsbury, county Shropshire (Salop), submitted all but two. In 1812 A. F. suggested that "Mr. Parkes, or any other gentleman," should supply the GM "with a view of the House and Grounds at the Leasowes about the time of Mr. Shenstone's death" (p. 216). Mr. Parkes was evidently considered knowledgeable about Shenstone and the Leasowes. What is more, he obliged A. F., albeit belatedly, with a drawing of the Leasowes, reproduced in the 1823 GM (ii, 105). D. Parkes almost surely knew, and possibly had a copy of, Shenstone's Poems Upon Various Occasions , published in 1737, a collection which Shenstone did his best to suppress. 5 The poem on "W. G. Parish-clerk at Broome" and that on the reluctance of females to sing were published in the 1737 collection, the second being simply identified by a Latin tag, Alboque simillima cygno , which served as an epigraph for the poem as reprinted, with its long title, in the GM . Thanks to D. Parkes we have that long, facetious title. The poem "In Broome so neat, in Broome so clean" was submitted with this accompanying letter, quoted in full: In Mr. Graves's "Recollections of Shenstone," p. 37, mentioning the early part of his life, he says, "about this time Mr. Shenstone wrote several little pieces of poetry, most of which, I believe, are buried in oblivion." The inclosed little ballad was given me by an intimate acquaintance of Shenstone, which he wrote at Broome, on his cousin Miss Dolman taking some verses left upon his table: this may be one alluded to above; it certainly was written about the time. Broome is a small village on the border of Staffordshire, near Hagley, (the seat of Lord Lyttelton). There Mr. Shenstone spent some of his juvenile hours at his uncle Dolman's; and in this retirement he sometimes amused himself by writing little pieces of poetry, as mentioned by his friend Graves. I have sent a small drawing of the Church (plate III. fig. I.), as it appeared in 1786; it is not unlikely this may be the only one to be met with, though I have heard the friends of Shenstone wish for a view, as it is a place mentioned in his works, and which his uncle Dolman, I have been informed, intended to have procured for him if he had taken orders. For a farther description of Broome, see Gough's Camden Vol. II. Shenstone was with the Dolmans at Broom in the summer of 1745. 6 The inscription For a Beech was prefaced by a letter and accompanied by a drawing of the cottage in Hales-Owen in Shropshire "once the infantile school of the celebrated poet Shenstone." And D. Parkes evidently visited Hales-Owen, where the farm The Leasowes was located, for the letter accompanying the inscription for Mrs. Arnold is dated from that place. The letter reads The following inscription I copied from a small MS book of poems, &amp;c. written by the late Mr. Shenstone, of the Leasowes, most of which have never been published. The inclosed was undoubtedly intended for his old faithful housekeeper, M. Arnold, facetiously mentioned in Letter II. of his Works, Dodsley's edition. As a literary curiosity, I shall be glad to see it in your entertaining Magazine. "Hunc juxta locum mortales sui exuvias â LXX annorum invidiâ tandem dilaceratas placidè deposuit M.A. amicum mancipium domino frugi quod fit satis." Yours, &amp;c. D.S.P. The following year, writing from Shrewsbury, but without signature, Parkes submitted the poem on the Parish-clerk of Broom, prefacing it with this short statement: "The inclosed is an original juvenile poem, written by the late Mr. Shenstone, of the Leasowes, when on a visit at Harborough, near Broome, the residence of his uncle Dolman. The annexed view of the old church at Broome, and the bell in the tree (which I well remember), are copied from a sketch in my possession taken by Mr. Shenstone in 1739, which I shall be glad to see engraved to accompany the poem" (1798.i,467). We do not owe the next addition to the canon to D. Parkes but to A. F. who, after suggesting that Parkes or somebody else supply a view of Leasowes, went on to say, Modest and worthy Shenstone! I knew him well. Amiable in his manners, willing to communicate, he was the friend of merit and the fosterer of genius. I well remember when a youth, that I showed him some Verses I had writen on the Leasowes, which, although they have little to recommend them, I will introduce, to show the willingness he had to assist a rhyming adventurer, and likewise the facility with which he wrote. With a pencil he immediately annexed the eight last lines, and returned me the verses. Verses written at The Leasowes, May 19, 1759. How soothing are those fragrant shades, With ev'ry beauty crown'd; Sequester'd valleys, fair cascades, And hills that smile around. O let me haunt this peaceful cell, In bliss unmix'd and pure; Here ev'ry sordid aim expel, And ev'ry anguish cure. But, ah! my humbler lot denies Such pleasure to my share; Ev'n in this calm abode, my sighs Disclose the pangs of care. Thrice happy thou , whom Fate's decree Has here securely blest; Would Fate allot one joy to me, And give thee all the rest. But tho' I to those woods rehearse , The woes with which I pine , Will wit and beauty read a verse , Or soothe a pang like mine ? Yet on this beech I grave my care , For FANNY'S eyes alone ; And may the purport please my fair , Or still remain unknown . In a letter of January, 1760 Shenstone referred to his inadvertently burning "ambrose Foley's old Ballads." He consoled himself with the though that if they had all been burnt "M r Ambrose must comfort himself, y t he has lost Nothing but what is infinitely inferior to what he is able to write himself." 7 Mr. Foley, a poet of sorts, seems the best candidate for A. F.; unfortunately the May 1759 visit to Leasowes is not mentioned in Shenstone's letters. D. Parkes, submitting the poem on the Cheltenham Waters and their discovery by pigeons, stated that Shenstone "spent some time at Cheltenham in 1742, which seems about the time this was written." According to the extant Shenstone correspondence the visit to Cheltenham was in 1743, but the dates of the pertinent letters (pp. 69 and 74) are conjectural. In any event Shenstone was at Cheltenham for a few months in 1742 or 1743. Parkes either possessed or had access to manuscripts belonging to Shenstone, a fact to which he refers again in what I take to be his last contributions to the GM on Shenstone. In the July 1827 GM he submitted the poem on the reluctance of females to sing when asked by friends and the Latin inscription on a "favourite little animal of the poet's." He must also have been familiar with Richard Graves, one of Shenstone's dearest friends and the author of The Spiritual Quixote , for John Nichols, in his Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , writes in a note on Graves that he had been "favoured, by Mr. D. [identified as David in Nichols's index] Parkes, of Shewsbury, with a faithful drawing of his Portrait," adding that he was "indebted to the same friend for a copy of the following poetical effusion," i.e. "Lines written while viewing a Portrait of Mr. Graves" by S. J. Pratt (III, 746). One would like to know more about Parkes, but all I have been able to find are some "Lines, In the old Black Letter, in a Cell, or Cave, belonging to Mr. D. Parkes, of Shrewsbury. This cell was discovered in 1802, in a remain of the antient fortification, on the North-west side of the town, and is fitted up with shields of arms, stained glass in the windows, and the floor laid with curious ornamented tiles or quarries," a short poem by J. F. M. D. in the March 1811 GM (p. 262).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Swift's Letter to the Rev. John Kendall, February 11, 1691-92 The first extant letter by Swift is printed by F. Elrington Ball and by Harold Williams from a transcript in the Leicester Museum. John Nichols stated that the original was owned at the end of the eighteenth century by one of the recipient's grandsons. The supposed original came to rest in the Leicester Museum, but, according to Williams "the transcript in the museum, long accepted as the original, has no claim to that distinction," as the paper "belongs to the latter half of the eighteenth century; and the script suggests the end of the century or the beginning of the next. The hand is not that of Swift; and the document has never passed through the post." 8 It has not been remarked that the letter was first printed in the GM for April, 1752 (pp. 157-158), with the following introduction by "J. W." of W--l, Staffordsh .", who claimed that he got it from "a son of Mr. Kendall , who was then my near neighbour, and had the original in his possession." Having lately read the earl of Orrery's letters, concerning the life and writings of Dr. Swift , and observing his lordship's remarks, in his second letter, upon one that the doctor wrote to his uncle, soon after his leaving the university, (in which his lordship says, we see nothing of that peculiar turn of phrase that is so visible in his other writings; and from whence he seems to infer that Swift's faculties had not then begun to exert and display themselves) I recollected that I had a letter in my possession of a somewhat earlier date than that which Lord Orrery has published, and withall more perfect; in which his Lordship (if he reads your Magazine) may see, that Dr. Swift was much the same man, with regard to the peculiarity of his turn of sentiment and phrase, at five and twenty, as he was, when his Lordship conversed with him, bating his improvements in the after part of his life. The letter, I can assure you, sir, is genuine, and was carefully transcribed by myself some years ago, from the original under the dean's own hand. I find, by Lord Orrery's account of him, that he sometimes visited his mother at Leicester . There, it seems, he had talked to a young lady in a strain, which, though usual with him, was thought somewhat particular by herself and her friends. Upon which the gentleman, to whom the letter was written, who was Dr. Swift's near relation, and had been with him at the university, was applied to, to write an expostulatory letter to him on his conduct towards her after his departure from Leicester ; to which letter, this which I have sent you is his answer; and this account I think it necessary to give you, by way of key to it. Both the letter and the account came to me from a son of Mr. Kendall , who was then my near neighbour, and had the original in his possession. The lady, without doubt, is dead, and every one else, in all probability, that were any ways interested in the affair. Therefore the publication of the said letter (which, from the date of it appears, at the latest, to have been written nine or ten months before that which Lord Orrery has produced, and, I am apt to think, from the same place too, viz. Moore Park ) can have no other effect than to let the world see Swift's picture drawn by himself, and how that wonderful man thought and wrote in his younger days, and before his appearance in it as an author. Perhaps no genuine production of his, earlier than this, can now be met with. As to his treatment, indeed, of the lady, and the place she lived in, no one, I dare say, will think it odd, or out of character, in such a man as he afterwards appeared to be; and who (as both Lord Orrery and Mrs Pilkington have observed, and, as is sufficiently evident too from a great part of his writings) was not over-favourable in his sentiments of the fair sex, nor over-complaisant in his behaviour to them; and who, either in his mirth or his anger, would never scruple to treat even kingdoms themselves with as little ceremony as he here does the town of Leicester . Ball noted that the Rev. Mr. Kendall "had two sons, one of whom was sometime 'gentleman' to the Earl of Clanricarde, and is mentioned by Swift in a letter to Sheridan of 20 July, 1736, as being then in the Irish revenue service." The letter is actually from Sheridan to Swift (Williams, IV, 519) and there is no reference to the Earl of Clanricarde, Ball mistaking the reference to " Colonel Nuburgh ." None of this helps much to identify which of Kendall's sons gave the original to his neighbor in the little village of Wall in Staffordshire. "J. W." was almost surely of the Wall family, but I have not been able to discover a J. Wall who is chronologically and geographically right. Wall is slightly south of Lichfield and about thirty miles due west of Leicester and about nineteen miles west of Thornton. I suppose that some time between 1752 and the end of the century J. Wall gave the letter to John Kendall of Thorpe Langton in Leicestershire, grandson to the recipient. In any event, the first appearance of the letter to Kendall in an edition of Swift was in 1762, the date of publication of the fourteenth volume of John Hawkesworth's edition of Swift's works, published in twelve volumes in 1755. William Bowyer, John Nichols's employer, had added volumes thirteen and fourteen and, as is well known, more volumes were to be added in subsequent years. Thomas Sheridan's edition of Swift's works (1784) was notable largely, if not solely, for his life of Swift, and it was Sheridan's edition that John Nichols revised and augmented in 1801. The text of the letter to Kendall, in these three editions was not, however, based on the GM text, as will be seen. In what follows I give page, line references, and text from the first volume of Williams's edition of the correspondence. The GM text is unique in yours (3,3,yours), mine (3,3,mine), think that though (4,21,though), (know 4,24, knew), demonstrations (4,31,Demonstration), angel (4,37,angell), lighting (5,3, listing), I (5,8,that I), just so (5,11,just). I have not listed differences in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. "Yours," "mine," and "angel," in the GM were italicized for emphasis. The other unique readings make good sense, with the possible exception of "lighting," although it too makes sense, albeit "listing" may be preferable. What is more, the GM text shares with Bowyer, Sheridan, and Nichols, that is without Ball and Williams, itself (3,13,my self) carried (4,22,carried on), a reason (4,28,Reason), to hate (4,29,[not] to have), 9 who (4,33,to), that manner (5,14,the manner). Four readings are common to GM and Williams alone: 'tis (3,1 and 4,7,is not), began (4,16,begin), having (5,10,and having). Three readings in Williams are unique: &amp; used (4,5,used), have always (4.14,always have), shew how (5,12, show you how). At one point GM , Bowyer et al , Ball, and Williams all disagree, the texts reading in order: and so entail miseries (5,1-2) and entail a misery, and to entail a misery, &amp; entail a misery. Bowyer et al omit "except all things else were agreable, and that I had mathematicall Demonstration for the falsehood of the first wch if it be not impossible I am sure is very like it" (4,30-32,[Williams's text]). Bowyer et al are unique in: these (4,1,in these), cunning (4,21,cunningest), these (4,35,they), thought (5,11,I thought). Nichols follows Sheridan in three readings: beside (5,8,Besides), in adding "affectionate" after "very" in the close of the letter, and in the signature, J. Swift (Jon. Swift). Only one reading is unique to Nichols: busy (4,8,so busy). The fact that GM and Bowyer, Sheridan, and Nichols share six readings not found in Ball and Williams (readings in which the last two agree) plus the fact that Bowyer et al omit thirty-one words found in GM (and in Ball and Williams) suggests that Bowyer's text was a faulty transcript of Wall's transcript of the original, or some descendant thereof. And the "supposed original" of the letter was almost surely simply another separate transcript of one of the existing transcripts or of some other unknown to us. Incidentally, where Ball's text is unique, in two readings, [(and who,4,5,(who], and (4,9, ends), it is wrong. The whole matter is rather messy and raises more questions than allows for answers, but at least one conclusion emerges: the standard text of the correspondence is corrupt in the letter to Kendall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Some Uncollected Poems I have come upon a small number of poems by minor poets of the eighteenth century in the GM and have failed to find them included in the canon of their presumptive authors. "Presumptive," because I am not sure that I have exhausted every avenue of possible corroboration or refutation. Since the poets are minor luminaries, at least as poets, I intend simply to list the poems under their different authors, giving title, first line, and location in the GM , with some appended remarks. John Langhorne (1735-1779) A Pastoral on the Death of the Rev. Mr. H--rtl--y.* While Nature's hand that never works in vain. 1755. 374. [The footnote reads, "Late vicar of K--by--St--n, W--sm--nd." The signature is simply "Langhorn" from "Skelton." Langhorne was born in the parish of Kirkby Stephen, Westmoreland. There was a Skelton in East Cumberland and one in the North Riding, NE Yorkshire, but I cannot locate Langhorne in either through available biographical sources. However, in 1756, a letter concerning "an earthquake at Black Hamilton in Yorkshire ," which shows familiarity with that locale, is signed "J. Langhorne" from "Thirsk" (p. 159). Thirsk is also in the North Riding, but I cannot find Black Hamilton in modern atlases.] Verses on a Hazel. Pride of all the sylvan train. 1756. 354. [With an epigraph "Nec Myrtus vincet Corylos, nec Laurea Phoebi," i.e. Virgil, Eclogue VIII., 1. 64. Signed "Langhorne."] [Hymnus ad Hygeiam. Grata venis, rediviva salus, in corpore sano. 1757. 181. From "Langhorne" of "Folkstone," it is by John's elder brother William who, himself a poet, was presented the perpetual curacy of Folkestone, Kent in 1754. Le Sociable. Partly in the manner of Milton. By Mr. Langhorne. Hence, gloomy spleen, and sullen care. 1758. 434. Verses occasion'd by Lord Lyttleton's on the Countess of Egremont. By Mr. John Langhorne. Sweet Muse of Hagley, whose melodious lyre. 1761. 232. An Epitaph and a poem on William Langhorne. In life belov'd, in death for ever dear. [and] Of Langhorne's life be this memorial given. 1802. ii, 1001. [These are in a letter by "S. E." and attributed by him to John Langhorne. S. E. claims to have copied these "from the original," i.e. from the stone in Folkestone church. Ten years later, in January 1815 another correspondent to the GM sent in both poems. There are three textual differences in the second, with the 1804 reading first: l. 2, race/face; l. 16 Pagan/Pagan's; l. 24, rest/test. The 1804 readings make better sense.] In the Garden of John Scott, Esq. at Amwell. In an Alcove. To scenes where Taste and Genius dwell. 1815. i, 387. [Signed "John Langhorne, D.D." This, too, is in a letter by "J. C." who had sent the two poems on William Langhorne in January 1815. There is a story that John was granted an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Edinburgh, but there is no record of such a grant. For the Scott-Langhorne friendship, see Lawrence D. Stewart, John Scott of Amwell (1956), pp. 46-47 and passim . Langhorne had written a poem in Scott's garden at Amwell in 1769 (Stewart, p. 46).] In the same Garden, in another Temple, under the words MIHI ET AMICIS. Thy friends have access to a nobler part. 1815. i, 387. Thomas Warton, the Younger (1728-90) Thoughts on New Year's Day. Of time, and months, and fleeting years. 1803. i, 498 [In a covering letter, "J. B." who was "resident in Oxford at the time Mr. Warton was near the meridian of his fame," deplored the absence of this poem and any other "moral or religious poem" of Warton's in Mant's edition. J. B., when a young man and residing in the University, was given a copy of the verses by "a friend and contemporary of Mr. Warton's." J. B. believed the verses an authentic "Juvenile composition of the late poet-laureat."] Joseph Warton (1722-1800) An Elegy on the Death of Miss Sukey Lister daughter of Mathew Lister, Esq.; and Lady Boughton his wife, their 9th child, of Lawford in Warwickshire. Behind the hills when sunk the dewy sun. 1764. 242. [A Matthew Dymoke Lister, of Broughton, Lancs., son of Matthew, of Lawford, matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in Dec. 1747, aged 17, M.A. 1752, d. 1772 ( Alumni Oxonienses ).] Francis Coventry (d. 1759?) Inscription for an Oak in Penhurst Park. By the late Mr. F. Coventry. Stranger kneel here! to age due homage pay. 1761. 184. [Coventry wrote a poem, Penshurst ; both it and the inscription celebrate the birth of Sir Philip Sidney at which time the oak was planted.] Thomas Edwards (1698-1757) Ode Occasioned by a Lady's being burnt with the curling irons. By the late Mr. Edwards, author of the Canons of Criticism. Fair British ladies, whom with matchless charms. 1768. 486. Arthur Murphy (1727-1805) Epitaph on the Death of John Ayton Thompson. If in the morn of life each winning grace. 1792. ii, 1136. [Signed "A. Murphy." A "Jn. Thompson" of "Nettleden, Bucks." died on Aug. 23, 1792 ( GM , 1792. ii, 770); no Thompson is mentioned in biographies of Murphy. However, an actor named Thompson who played minor roles at the Haymarket from Feb. 1778 to Feb. 6, 1792 (the last recorded appearance) may very well be the subject of the epitaph, given Murphy's association with the theatre. The epitaph is for a young man, and the actor Thompson's brief career on the stage lends further credence to my conjecture. 10 Lyttleton, George, first Baron Lyttleton (1709-73) To Mr. Hacket of Baliol-College, Oxford, on his playing the Part of Othello, at a private entertainment. Thanks, gentle youth! and thanks to fixed fate. 1755. 133. [John Hackett, Son of John of Westminster, gent. matriculated Balliol College 5 March 1752, aged 17.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Another Text of a Poem by Thomas Warton The April 1815 issue of the GM contained the following letter: ON perusing lately the XVth volume of Beauties of England and Wales, I was struck with the following passage, p. 311: " Ansley Hall was visited 1758 by the elegant and truly-poetical Thomas Warton, at which time he wrote, and left in this cell, some beautiful verses, beginning, 'Beneath the stony roof reclin'd, I sooth to peace my pensive mind.' It may be observed, that the verses, as printed in Warton's Poetical Works, differ much from the simply-pleasing original copy, which is still preserved at Ansley Hall." Now, if this should meet the eye of the present Possessor of that Mansion, or of any of his Friends, I should feel myself, as an admirer of the productions of Warton, much obliged for a transcript of the verses. Yours, &amp;c. F. J. Meadors. Mr. Meadors had not long to wait, for in the very next month (pp. 387-388), "J. N. L." wrote, with considerable authority, on the origin of the poem and quoted it in its entirety. John Newdigate Ludford of Ansley Hall, Warwickshire had matriculated at University College, Oxford on 11 November 1774, aged 18, and had proceeded to the M.A. (1778) and the D.L.C. (1793). He died on 16 May 1825 ( Alumni Oxonienses, 1715-1886 ). The poem is preceded by the statements that "An old house and oratory, called Bret's Hall , were pulled down about the year 1750, and the stones of the oratory removed into the old gardens of Ansley Hall, where in a small dale they were formed into a cell for an hermitage, and at present remain so. Mr. T. Warton, the celebrated Poet Laureat, wrote the annexed copy of verses there in April, 1758." The poem, Warton's Inscription in a Hermitage , thirty-two lines in length, is quoted, and then Ludford writes: "These verses, as printed in the several editions of Mr. Warton's Works, are taken from an altered copy, published by himself, with other Poems, in 12mo.London,1777.—The facts are as follows: Mr Warton was tutor to the last Earl and late Marquis of Donegall, of Trinity College, and as such visited Ansley Hall in the Easter vacation 1758, when he wrote and left these verses in the cell. He never saw Ansley Hall after that time above once, if ever, and that the following year. Lord Donegall leaving Oxford in 1759, or thereabouts, came of age in 1760; and of course all connexions between Mr. Warton and Ansley Hall ceased. The two poems are now before the publick; and let them be the judges whether the natural and local simplicity of the original, written upon the spot, with all the objects around him, and on the spur of the moment, is not preferable to the stiff and affected style of the altered copy published by the finished Poet, afterwards Poet Laureat, certainly above 18, if not nearer 20 years after he had ceased visiting Ansley Hall, and of course forgot all the locality of the Poem. And as the copy he has given the publick is very different from the original, having little or no resemblance (except in the first and last words, and first verse , and this is even mutilated, and the word "co-genial," in the second verse, which he still retained), I verily believe he wrote this entirely from memory, without a scrap of the original Poem in his possession, though he knew I was resident at Oxford at the very time, and could have furnished him with a copy at any time, as I always carried it in my port-feuille , and he knew the original in his own hand-writing (which I still have safe at Ansley Hall) was in the hands of the late Miss Juliana Ludford carefully preserved.' J.N.L." Warton contributed a poem titled The Complaint of Cherwell to an Oxford collection of verses on the death of George II in the name of John Chichester, brother to the Earl of Donegal, Gentleman Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford. The poem, as it appears in Warton's 1777 Poems , in Richard Mant's edition (2 vols., 1802) and in Chalmers's Works of the English Poets is made up of five eight-line stanzas; the GM text omits the entire fourth stanza, i.e. At eve, within yon studious nook, I ope my brass-embossed book, Pourtray'd with many a holy deed Of Martyrs, crown'd with heavenly meed: Then, as my taper waxes dim, Chant, ere I sleep, my measur'd hymn; And, at the close, the gleams behold Of parting wings bedropt with gold. It should be remarked that Mant thought very highly of the poem, stating that he knew no English poem in the "eight-syllable verse" superior to it (I, cxxxiii) and being particularly taken by "the exquisite stroke at the end of the fourth stanza" (I, cxliv). The only difference, other than in accidentals, between the 1777 and 1802 texts is the former's "cogenial" in line 11 as opposed to the 1802 "congenial," something noted by Ludford. Interestingly enough, the OED quotes Warton's History of English Poetry twice for "cogenial," the only other illustration coming from Joseph Ritson's infamous Observations on Warton's History . Ritson recommended "congenial" to Warton in place of "cogenial." In the following collation the first reading is from the received text; the second, from the GM . Line 3, elms/trees; l. 10, pipes/sings; l. 12, wove/built; l. 13, busy scenes, and brighter skies/social scenes, by Nature wise; l. 16, morn I take my custom'd round/morn and eve I take my round; l. 17, buds yon shrubby/blows my flowery; l. 18, opening/budding; l. 22, That grace/Which deck; l. 23, winding wreaths/many a wreath; l. 32, my bliss create/retirement wait; l. 36, humble/thoughtful; l. 38, amice/mantle; l. 40, blameless/peaceful. Milton, whose poetry is echoed a number of times in Warton's poem, has "in amice gray" in Paradise Regained , IV. 427. If Ludford is right about the original composition of Warton's poem, the later version, with its extra stanza containing "wings bedropt with gold," an echo of Paradise Lost , VII. 406, "coats dropped with gold," seems intended to strengthen the Miltonic tone. Pope has "The yellow carp in scales, bedropt with gold" in Windsor Forest (l. 144). so that Warton could have had the Popean imitation of Milton in mind also. But the decision as to the comparative merits of the two versions must, to borrow an eighteenth-century locution, be left to the reader. Another Text of a Poem by Matthew Prior? The editors of The Literary Works of Matthew Prior print the following text of the short poem On Bishop Atterbury's Burying the Duke of Buckingham from Prior's Poems on Several Occasions (1727) and list no other appearances of it: I HAVE no Hopes , the Duke he says, and Dies; In sure and certain Hopes —the Prelate cries: Of These Two learned Peers , I prithee say, Man, Who is the lying Knave , the Priest or Layman ? The Duke he stands an Infidel Confest, He's our dear Brother , quoth the Lordly Priest. The Duke , tho' Knave , Still Brother dear he cries, And, who can say, the Rev'rend Prelate lies? 11 What has gone unremarked is a somewhat different text of the poem as printed in the GM in August 1784 (p. 596). MR. URBAN, THE following epigram was written by Mr. Prior, on the funeral of the Duke of Buckingham, in Westminster Abbey, as performed by Bishop Atterbury, in 1721; that famous Bishop of Rochester, whose Memoirs, lately published by Mr. Nichols, contain the history of that accomplished, but turbulent, prelate from his advancement to the see of Rochester in 1713, to his banishment to France in 1722—and his own interment in 1732. See vol. I. p. 79. "I have no hope," The Duke he said, and dies: "In sure and certain hope," the Prelate cries. Of these two learned peers, I pr'ythee—say, man, Who is the greatest liar, the priest or layman? The Duke he dies An INFIDEL confest: "He's our dear brother," says the lordly priest. The Duke a KNAVE! Still "BROTHER dear," he cried, And who dare say "the reverend Prelate lied?" REMARK. They neither lied—each spake as undeceiv'd, What all suspected, and now all BELIEV'D. Recourse to the first volume, published in 1783, of John Nichols's edition of Bishop Atterbury's Epistolary Correspondence . . . reveals that the poem is quoted in its seeming entirety by Nichols in a footnote to Atterbury's letter of 27 September, 1721 to Alexander Pope. The text, except for accidentals, is the same as that printed by Wright and Spears, and one is therefore faced with the problems that rise from the text in the GM , for the differences between it and the text in Nichols's footnote are such as to seem to preclude faulty transcriptions. And is the two-line Remark appended to the poem Prior's? If not, whose? What makes the matter especially interesting is that Nichols was one of two managers (the DNB 's word) of the GM in 1784, as well, of course, as the editor of Bishop Atterbury's correspondence. What is more, immediately preceding the poem and its headnote in the GM is a communication by "Eugenio" whose running title, "Anecdotes of Dr. Gifford," shares the top of the page with "Epigram by Prior." Now "Eugenio" was one of Nichols's pseudonyms, and one would think that he would have seen the text of the poem below his own communication and the reference to his edition of Atterbury, the first volume of which, with a different text of the poem, had been published less than a year and a half earlier. 12</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI The Text and Canon of Byron's Poems While looking for something entirely different in the GM I took note of the appearance of poems by or attributed to Byron in the years 1812 through 1824. They are, in order of appearance, as titled in the GM : 1. Address on the opening of Drury Lane Theater. Written by Lord Byron; and spoken by Mr. Elliston (1812.ii,470). 2. To a Beautiful Quaker (1813.i,256). 3. Love, By Lord Byron (1812.ii,366). 4. The Skull Goblet. Attributed to Lord Byron (1814.iii,575-576). [With a three-word epigraph from the Greek of Lucian; the epigraph is not in Coleridge's edition of the poems.] 5. The Eye of Blue! "From 'Hebrew Melodies', set to Music by Mr. Braham and Mr. Nathan" (1815.i,450). [Titled "I Saw Thee Weep" in Coleridge.] 6. Fare Thee Well! (Ascribed to Lord Byron) (1815.i,351-2). 7. The AEnigma—By Lord Byron (1818.ii,447-8). 8. Ode to Venice (1819.ii,256-7). 9. Lord Byron to Mr. T. Moore (1821.i,73). 10. Stanzas (1824.ii,361). Except for accidentals, the Drury Lane address in the GM is textually identical with the received text, i.e. the Oxford Byron based on E. H. Coleridge's edition of the poems (7 vols., 1904). That the GM text should not differ in the seventy-three lines of that poem is of significance for what follows, for there are textual differences in four of the other poems as printed in the GM . Since one of the poems (No. 7) is not in the accepted canon, that leaves four other poems (5, 6, 8, and 9) textually identical to the Oxford edition, although in the reprinting of No. 8 lines 42 through 124 are omitted in the GM . In number 6, however, it should be noted that the GM text, taken from the pamphlet in which the poem originally appeared, has two readings preferred to the text of Leigh Hunt's Examiner in which the poem was reprinted on April 29, 1816. 13 The two preferred readings in the GM may be thought to be offset by four others which differ from the received text, although two of the four are the change of "Even" to "Ev'n." Number 3 is an excerpt from The Giaour , ll. 1131 ff. 14 In what follows I give the received reading first and then the GM 's. Number 2: (l. 14) in/a; (l. 15) falsehoods/language; (l. 29) This/Thus; (l. 36) make/ makes; (l. 44) dictate/dictates; (l. 46) never can/ne'er can; (l. 47) [omitted in GM ]; 15 (l. 48) bliss/bless'd. The GM readings in ll. 15, 36, and 44 are demonstrably wrong; those in ll. 29, 46, and 48 are all possible readings, while that in l. 14 is the reading in Coleridge, but not in the Oxford edition. 16 One is left with the impression of a faulty transcription, although there is the one, possibly inadvertent, true reading in l. 14. But whatever conclusions are to be reached about the value, or lack thereof, in the GM texts must depend upon analysis of all the texts in the periodical. GM differs from Oxford in five lines in Number 4: (l. 8) hath/has; (l. 13) Where once my wit, perchance, hath shone/And, where perchance my wit has shone; (l. 14) others'/others; (l. 18) like me/alike; (l. 21) since/when. While the readings in l. 14 is preferable in Oxford, the other four readings in the GM are possible. Perhaps the curious may wish to know that Byron uses "hath" six times and "has" four times in the entire corpus of his poetry. Professor McGann (see note 14) writes, "No. 4 is an interesting case; it could be a bad copy of the original (1814) printing, but I doubt it. It seems a transcription from a MS., and so— since the surviving MSS vary from it—the GM text (not previously known to me) is important." The greatest number of textual differences occur in Number 9: (l. 3) before/ere; (l. 5) to those who love me/for those I love; (l. 6) to those who hate/for those I hate; (l. 7) above me/above; (l. 8) a heart/heart; (l. 10) Yet it/It! (l. 13) Were't/Were it; (l. 14) upon/on; (l. 15) spirit/spirits; (l. 17) With/In; (l. 19) with/to. One would think that even the most careless transcriber would not make eleven errors in a poem of twenty lines. Possibly the transcriber officiously sought to make ll. 3, 8, 10, and 14 conform to the metrical scheme he thought the poem followed. This would explain why he changed ll. 5, 6; i.e. so that "above," his rhyme-word for l. 7, would have something to rhyme with in l. 5. Possibly, however, the transcription is a faithful one from a foul copy, although there is no mention of a manuscript in the GM , nor indeed of anything, for the poem is printed without comment. It is at this point that I would recall to attention the fact that the text of the 73-line address at the opening of Drury Lane theatre in the GM is identical to the received text. So, too, are the seventy-seven lines of the abbreviated poem on Venice (No. 8). How does one account for a high degree of fidelity in the two long poems and eleven differences in a poem of twenty lines? One can, of course, predicate two transcribers at work, only one of whom bothered with verbal niceties. However, Professor McGann writes, "Your text of this poem is derived from the text printed in The Traveller of 8 Jan. 1821. I have not been able to trace an earlier version, MS or otherwise, for this particular variant of the poem." One poem remains, and with it a problem. Coleridge prints a poem, On the Death of the Duke of Dorset , from "an autograph MS. in the possession of Mr. Murray, now for the first time printed. . . . It is endorsed 'Bought of Markham Thorpe, August 29, 1844'" (III, 425, n.1). Coleridge was, of course, wrong in stating that the poem had not been printed before. What is more, there are five differences in the GM text of this sixteen-line poem: (l. 3) wast/wert; (l. 5) my/mine; (l. 6) The/Its; (l. 7) it bids me dry/its lids deny; (l. 9) dull/deep. Whatever the poetic superiority of any one of these readings over another, one is still faced with the fact of the difference. Curiously enough, Oxford does not print the poem, although it does not seem to fall into the category of "shorter pieces—mostly juvenile verses and jeux d'esprit " avowedly there although present in Coleridge. Again I quote Professor McGann: "no. 10 as you have it is a reprint from the 1824 printing in Arliss's Pocket Magazine . The textual problems you note are a function of Coleridge's miscopyings, or misreadings, of his MS (there is another MS as well . . . which agrees largely with the one Coleridge used)." The AEnigma (No. 7) is by Catherine Maria Fanshawe, whose "best" known poem is the riddle on the letter H, which has been often attributed to Lord Byron, and has been included in at least two editions of his works" ( DNB ). She was in Byron's company at least once, her account of which meeting appearing in at least two publications.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII William Beckford's Copy of William Beloe's Sexagenarian in the Cambridge University Library Although the catalogue of MSS in the Cambridge University Library lists William Beckford's copy of M. A. Sabellici, Rerum Venetarum Libri XXXIII as having a MS note by Beckford, i.e. "Bound by C. Lewis," there is no listing for the four pages of MS notes in Beckford's copy of William Beloe's Sexagenarian , 2 vols., 1817, shelf-marks Adv. c. 87.8 and 9. Beckford's habit of writing notes in pencil on the fly-leaves of his books is well known, and a number of these notes have been transcribed. 17 Beloe's Sexagenarian was acquired by the Cambridge University Library in the sale of the books of Henry Richards Luard, University Registery from 1862 to 1891. A MS note by Luard reads, "This was Beckford's copy, by whom are the pencil notes in the beginning of the two volumes. The notes throughout the volume are mine." While Luard's notes are of interest, as they identify many unnamed persons in the two volumes, they are informative rather than critical. Some of Beckford's are critical in more than one sense of the word. Beckford's comments are keyed to pages of the two volumes of Beloe's work and are often quotation or paraphrase of Beloe's text. They are of some value and interest as an index of what captured Beckford's attention. And they do nothing to belie his reputation for causticness. A reference to the Bishop of Quebec in volume I on p. 75, is largely loose quotation: "The present Bishop of Quebec was originally a grocer's apprentice in which situation the Sexagenarian had seen him employed; but having a taste &amp; talent for more exalted things than weighing plums &amp; breaking sugar he has risen to eminence." In what follows I give page references to the first volume plus an explanatory remark where necessary and then Beckford's comment. P. 89, Gilbert Wakefield's caustic manner: "instance of G. Wakefield's extreme asperity proved by one of his letters which proves also the justice of the sentence which condemned him to Dorchester Jail," i.e. for a libellous pamphlet. P. 145, a young lady of masculine appearance was subjected to a practical joke in which her bed was elevated: "singular elevation of a masculine young lady." P. 278, on Horace Walpole: "anecdotes not much to the credit of Horace Walpole's hospitality or liberality." P. 292, "he used always to wash &amp; put away his fine Dresden breakfast China—in the most notable and old-Lady like manner." The description of Walpole's manner is Beckford's, not Beloe's. P. 327, partially paraphrase and partially quotation of Beloe on Mrs. Hayley, John Wilkes's sister: "Commemoration of Mrs. Hayley (the sister of John Wilkes) who used to sit out all the more remarkable trials at the Old Bailey &amp; whose professed object was to see every body &amp; every thing which deserved or excited attention." Page 359, "Raking Up some of Helen Maria Williams's garbage," which last word he took from Beloe. P. 387, partially quoted from Beloe: "Mrs. Piozzi's most preposterous predilection for a young Italian mountaineer calling himself the nephew of her late never enough to be lamented musician man &amp; when she has thought proper in defiance of all propriety to transform into the representative of the ancient Salusburys— pointed out, as is right to be, with the finger of scorn and reprobation." P. 408, largely quotation from Beloe: "D r Brook the husband of the authoress of that very pleasing novel of Emily Montague was one of the greatest bon vivants of his time—the deity of the table was almost the only one he worshipped with consistent devotion &amp; in pursuance of this object he was a member of a club which was called Number Six.—It consisted of six members; they met at six in the Eve. &amp; never parted till six in the Morning.—not withstanding his habitual indulgence in the festivities of the Table D r Brook lived to a very advanced age." P. 415, "Mrs. Opie—a precieuse ," Beloe's word. P. 435, largely quotation from Beloe: "D r Porteous who had been B r of Chester for many years used laughingly to say he had never interest enough to procure a good Cheshire Cheese." Perhaps it will be best to summarize the notes in volume two, as they are largely quotation from Beloe. P. 5, John Wilkes as a sad dog, but delightful and well-informed. P. 9, Wilkes's passion for collecting Bibles. P. 61, Browne the Africa traveller had passages "so bad as not to be transcribed" in his "otherwise valuable publications." P. 74, on Tibetan women who practiced polyandry, a "heavy burden" (Beloe) on them: Beckford commented, "a heavy family." Pp. 76-78, Lord Valentia, suffering disappointments, went to India for a change of scene; as a result he published three [sic] volumes of travels, of which Beloe thought little. Beckford commented, of the volumes: "upon which our Sexagenarian, however snarlingly disposed, could not avoid bestowing praise as containing much information particularly of a political tendency by no means unimportant." P. 82, Beckford's concluding remark on Lord Valenti, entirely in his own words: "Never perhaps were the advantages of Birth &amp; Rank more conspicuous than upon this occasion—Their possessor, who in the British Capitol would have been shunned and pointed at [,] was caressed &amp; glorified in British India where he moved about in government Barges and Palanquins &amp; held Durbars or Levies which were fully and obsequiously attended &amp; in short enjoyed so many perogatives &amp; distinctions as induced the natives both Hindus &amp; Moslems to believe him to be a no less personage than the Son or at least grandson of Mother Company herself , that omnipotent, mysterious old Woman the Ruler &amp; also in some instances the Scourge of so many millions!" 18 P. 84, on Bishop George Gleig: "no very reasonable thwack laid over a R. t Rev d Bishop's shoulders." P. 156, on the vast riches of the brothers, Lord Eldon and Sir W. Scott; P. 160, on the elevation of the first Jew to the British peerage; P. 158 [sic], on the rise of the house of Thellusson from humble origins. P. 213, Dr. Johnson on Hoole's Grubstreet unbringing. P. 215, on Gifford's satiric couplet on the poet Terningham, upon which Beckford commented: "Yet he rallied again &amp; took leave of the public in a dying song." The page is cropped, causing a line to be absolutely illegible.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Practicing "The Necessity of Purification": Cromek, Roscoe, and Reliques of Burns by Dennis M. Read</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The importance of R. H. Cromek's edition of Reliques of Robert Burns; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs (London: Cadell &amp; Davies, 1808) has been noted by modern Burns scholars, among them J. DeLancey Ferguson, who describes the volume as "the fruit of diligent research" and J. W. Egerer, who calls it "one of the most important publications" in the Burns bibliography. 1 Cromek not only published, by Egerer's count, thirty-eight new poems and seventy-four new letters, but he also made possible the textual preservation of a number of them, for, as J. DeLancey Ferguson notes, many of the original manuscripts have since disappeared. 2 A comparison of surviving manuscripts with their published versions in Reliques shows that Cromek maintained textual fidelity, something unusual in an age when editors freely practiced silent emendation. Ferguson, speaking of the Burns letters Cromek published, states that Cromek "had some kind of text before him for everything he printed, and followed it carefully, his deviations from the wording of the original being such minor errors as may naturally occur through hasty transcription or careless proofreading." 3 This close correlation between the manuscript and the printed version both distinguishes Cromek's editing achievement in Reliques and strengthens the textual authority of those pieces for which no manuscript survives. Bringing out the edition, however, turned out to be much more difficult than Cromek had anticipated and involved his sacrificing a number of Burns pieces in order to get permission to publish the rest. Cromek's difficulties with Robert Ainslie, Burns's travelling companion and correspondent, over publishing Burns's Journal of the Border Tour in the volume have been known for more than eighty years, since the publication of some of the letters in the Earnock Collection of the National Library of Scotland in 1899. 4 However, that selection of letters does not show the full extent of Cromek's difficulties. Nor does it disclose Cromek's more formidable antagonist, William Roscoe (1753-1831) of Liverpool. In fact Cromek was prevented from publishing many Burns materials in the volume by Roscoe, who had the power to veto anything he considered damaging to Burns's reputation, and who exercised that veto often—but not necessarily before Cromek had put the questionable selections to press. The entire story of how the volume was published—and how parts of it were not—shows the differences of the two men over notions of propriety and proprietorship. William Roscoe was a close friend and associate of Dr. James Currie (1756-1805), the editor of the four-volume Works of Robert Burns , first published by Cadell and Davies in 1800. 5 According to Ferguson, Roscoe and Burns were correspondents, 6 and shortly after Burns's death in 1796 Roscoe mentioned in a letter to the Rev. John Edwards that Burns had been intending to meet him in Liverpool before his final illness prevented it (Liverpool City Libraries [hereafter LCL]; printed in TLS , October 2, 1937, p. 715). Roscoe advised Currie about his edition of Burns as well; Currie states in an undated letter to Cadell and Davies about preparing the edition, "I shall . . . have the consel and assistance of my excellent friend, Mr. Roscoe, whenever I require it" (National Library of Scotland [hereafter NLS]; printed in Burns Chronicle 8 [1899], 9). Cromek's problems have their source in another letter by Currie to Cadell and Davies in which he states that he and Roscoe "will not in any future edition add any of his [Burns's] works to those already selected by you for publication, except such as we think will do credit to his character, and which you, or such other friends of the family as may be appointed by them to decide in that behalf may approve" (NLS; printed in Burns Chronicle 8 [1899], 9). When Currie died in 1805, Roscoe was left to guard the four-volume monument to Burns that his close friend had erected against future desecration. In discharging this duty, Roscoe believed he was protecting the reputation not only of the poet Burns but also of the editor and biographer Currie. 7 Currie's edition was a success, and three more editions followed in succeeding years. In 1803, Cromek first involved himself with Currie's Works of Burns when he entered into an agreement with Cadell and Davies to produce illustrations jointly with his friend Thomas Stothard for a subsequent edition. In his letter of March 25, 1803, Cromek wrote to Davies: "M r . Stothard requested I would beg of you to send him the Edition of Burns in 4 Vol s .— He will then be enabled to refer to y e . Books for Subjects as well as myself. . . . M r . Stothard's Heart is so much with Burns that I hope, when he has once made a beginning, I shall be able to engage his Talent almost exclusively—" (NLS). Cadell and Davies, however, decided not to include any illustrations in the subsequent editions of 1804 and 1806, and whatever illustrations Cromek and Stothard produced were left unused. Some four years later, Cromek's interest in Burns was revived when, in June 1807, while in Edinburgh to sell subscriptions to an engraving of Stothard's painting, The Procession of the Canterbury Pilgrims , he started noticing various previously unpublished Burns materials. Before long, he was planning an edition of these materials to add a fifth volume to Currie's edition. Cromek knew that Roscoe's endorsement was essential to the success of this venture. He had met Roscoe in Liverpool during the summer of 1806, when he was selling subscriptions to Blair's Grave , illustrated by Blake. 8 He later published an engraving of Currie on March 2, 1807 and inscribed the plate to Roscoe. This gesture no doubt enhanced Cromek's affairs with Roscoe. Roscoe not only was willing to support Cromek's idea to publish this collection of Burns materials but also offered to comb the Burns materials collected by Currie but left out of his Works for additional pieces. On October 5, 1807, Roscoe advanced Cromek's cause enormously by writing an effusively partisan letter of introduction to Cadell and Davies for him: This will probably be delivered to you by M r . Cromek, who having made an excursion this summer to Edinburgh, has devoted a considerable part of his time to the collecting further accounts of Robert Burns &amp; discovering the scattered remains of his writings—For this purpose he has visted the different places where the poet resided &amp; has seen &amp; conversed with his Widow &amp; many of his surviving Friends, by whose assistance he has got together a considerable number of Letters &amp; other pieces many of which appear to possess a great show of Interest. These it is his intention to publish; &amp; I have therefore ventured to recommend him to call upon you in preference to any others of the profession, assuring him that I am well convinced that if you should think his anecdotes &amp; collections likely to prove of sufficient importance to lay before the public he would find you disposed to treat with him for the publication &amp; editing of the work on fair &amp; liberal terms.—For your further guidence on this subject it may be proper to add, that in the course of last autumn I looked over the papers relating to Burns which had been in the possession of my late ever lamented friend D r . Currie for the purpose of advising M r . Wallace Currie [the son of Dr. Currie] as to such Letters as ought to be returned to the owners &amp;c, &amp; that it appeared to me that altho' there was nothing amongst them that could with propriety be introduced into the Doct rs . Ed n . of Burns' works yet at the same time there are, I think, some things that might be sufficiently interesting to make a part of a separate publication, &amp; would unite very well with those which M r . Cromek has collected, so as to go a good way towards forming an additional volume. If, after this explanation you should agree with M r . Cromek, I will with great readiness examine again the papers in Liverpool &amp; furnish you with any thing that appears to me likely to be favourably received by the public; keeping in view one precaution, so admirably &amp; closely adhered to by our late excellent friend, &amp; in which I am sure we shall all agree, viz. not to publish any thing contrary to decency &amp; good manners, or that can in any point injure the reputation of that extraordinary but eccentric Son of Genius whom we so much admire, &amp; so deeply lament (Roscoe's copy, LCL). It would seem at this point that little was amiss about the project. Certainly Roscoe expressed much confidence in Cromek, and Roscoe added that he personally would select the pieces from those left by Currie, always adhering to the cardinal rule of "decency &amp; good manners." Several weeks later, on October 22, 1807, Roscoe wrote again to Cadell and Davies that he expects Cromek's price for the edition will be reasonable: ". . . I only write now confidentially , to state to you that when I recommended him to call upon you &amp; propose the work to you in preference to any others, he appeard moderate in his expectations, &amp; thought that about 100g s . would pay him for the trouble he has had in collecting the papers &amp; may have in writing the work, to which . . . I think some additional pieces might be added from the papers in Liverpool" (NLS). Roscoe's notion of a fair price, however, was not Cromek's, as Cromek indicated in his letter of November 17, 1807, to Archibald Constable. In it he discloses that he has informed Cadell and Davies he has spent sixty guineas to obtain the Burns materials, which is "not far from y e . mark. . . . Certainly a Vol. of this interesting sort will be worth 250 Guineas[.]" Even after deducting Cromek's expenses from that amount, Cromek's total is nearly twice that of Roscoe's. But either figure at this point is conjectural; according to Cromek, Cadell and Davies has stated to him simply that "if you [would] like to leave y e . Price to us you shall not only receive a proper Price but a liberal one" (NLS). Cromek soon received other forms of encouragement. He wrote to James Montgomery of Sheffield on December 30, 1807, that "very unexpectedly I have been engaged by Cadell &amp; Davies (who have purchased Burns's Manuscripts) to make a Journey to Edinburgh &amp; its vicinity to collect Papers not yet come to Hand [.]" Cromek states that he plans to leave for Edinburgh New Year's Eve and adds with characteristic assurance, "I am well informed that my veneration for his [Burns's] memory will induce me to suppress every thing hostile to his character" (Sheffield City Libraries Archives, Sheffield Literary &amp; Philosophical Society [SLPS] 36/107). Cromek spent January in Scotland looking for more Burns materials, and on February 8, 1808, William Wallace Currie wrote to Cadell and Davies, "We have M r Cromek here [in Liverpool] now—he tells me he had [ sic ] been very successful in his last journey to Scotland—the few papers of Burns that remain in my possession, M r . Roscoe &amp; myself have looked over &amp; he was to talk to M r C[romek] about them yesterday at Allerton [Roscoe's home, located six miles from Liverpool]" (NLS). Meanwhile, a week earlier, in a letter dated February 1, Cadell and Davies wrote to Roscoe that Cromek, who "will be your Visitor about this Time," will be able to inform him about "what has been settled between us, respecting Burns's Reliques " (LCL). Since no figure is mentioned, it is not possible to know whether Cromek or Roscoe was closer to what Cadell and Davies finally agreed to pay. Cromek's stay in Liverpool was a period of exultation for him. He wrote on February 12 to Cadell and Davies from Allerton in a burst of bonhomie that Roscoe has examined all the manuscripts he has brought back from Scotland while he has gone through "the Liverpool Collection" of Burns materials. "[I]t is almost incredible to think of the number of sterling, first rate productions of the Poet still remaining buried in the Pile," Cromek wrote. Furthermore, Roscoe has contributed to the volume in two other ways. First, he has begun writing "some Remarks on the Dignity and Independence of Genius , to be attached to my preface." Secondly, he has designed the title page for the volume over a glass of wine, playfully appending to Cromek's name the titular initials, P.P.E.T.M. and F.O.O.C., which, he explains to Cromek, stand for "Poet, Painter, Engraver, Traveller, Man" and "Father of One Child" (NLS). It would seem at this point that Roscoe had approved everything Cromek intended to publish in the volume. Furthermore, when Gilbert Burns, the poet's brother, wrote to Roscoe asking whether Cromek's venture was one honorable to Burns's reputation, Roscoe replied in a letter of March 9, 1808 that "I most truly believe . . . he [Cromek] will not intentionally publish any thing which he does not think likely to do him honour." The underlined word suggests that Roscoe finds Cromek's enthusiasm sometimes overrides his judgment. If so, however, any errors in Cromek's judgment will be corrected by Cadell and Davies, who "from considerations of their own credit &amp; their own interest will be cautious that no improper articles are admitted." In addition, Roscoe assures Burns's brother that while "I cannot take upon myself the responsibility for what it [the volume] may contain I have however freely given my opinion on the questions proposed to me by M r . Cromek, &amp; shall continue to give the best assistance I can to render the publication as respectable as possible" (Roscoe's copy, LCL). Cromek meanwhile was in London sending copy to the printer James McCreery to be set into type, advancing the production of Reliques of Burns in a rapid manner. In short order he sent the first five sheets to Roscoe. In short order Roscoe responded with a jarring letter to Cromek, and on March 26, 1808, when Cromek received the letter, his cloud of serenity was suddenly dispelled. The letter, Cromek wrote to Roscoe, "has nearly driven me mad," for the printing of the volume is well advanced: "the first four sheets of the Work are printed off 3000 of each—"; "I would, most chearfully cancel the two sheets, though it would cost me nearly 40£ so to do—but I have not sufficient, indeed I have not any Letters to supply their place." Roscoe has two objections. First, he finds the several poems that begin the collection to be of indifferent quality and therefore argues that they should not "be put in the front of the battle." Secondly, he thinks the note "relating to the alteration of Burns's Text" and another "respecting the feelings of the living members of the Poet's family" should be omitted. Cromek helplessly agrees to all of Roscoe's surgery, acquitting himself by writing, "The first Note was put by my friend McCreery, much against my Will—I suppressed the Letter to which the second Note alludes at the most anxious desire of Rob t . Burns, the Son; and this Note was written by himself." Sensing that Roscoe's confidence in him might be shaken, Cromek labors to reassure him: "In the second Edition the Works shall certainly begin with Richmond's Letter as you wish—[In fact the first edition begins with Burns's letter to John Richmond of Edinburgh, dated February 17, 1786.] I trust &amp; hope, my good Sir, you will Do me the justice to believe that I have not wantonly Departed from any one wish of yours respecting the arrangement of the Materials." Anticipating possible objections by Roscoe over several pieces which appear later in the volume, Cromek suggests that "the Letter to McMath and Holy Willie's Prayer may be properly and sufficiently guarded by a judicious Notice inserted in the Volume so as to catch the Eye of the Reader before he begins the Letters." In any case, Cromek acquiesces to Roscoe over any changes he might call for: "I send two more Sheets. As you will be writing to M r . McCreery, they shall not be printed off 'till your approbation is known" (LCL). Instead of sending his approbation, however, Roscoe quickly wrote Cromek a censorious letter, and Cromek dispatched himself immediately to Allerton to work out the entire volume with Roscoe once more. The results of that meeting set Cromek back considerably. Roscoe detailed these results in a letter of April 9, 1808 to Cadell and Davies: "A short time after M r . Cromek had begun to print his Vol[.] of Burns, the proofs of the first sheets was sent to me, when I was equally surprized &amp; sorry to see that the work opened with some poems of the admission of which I very much doubt; but which in that situation wo d . have given a most unfavourable idea of the work. . . . I am sorry to say that in my opinion the 7 [ sic ] sheets now printed must be cancelled &amp; the work begun again altho' it will undoubtedly be attended with a very considerable expense." The problem arose, Roscoe explains, out of the agreement between Cromek and himself to order the letters chronologically. This Cromek took to mean a chronological arrangement of all the materials, poems and letters alike, and when he found two poems whose composition antedated that of any letters, he placed them at the beginning of the volume. Roscoe, however, is worried that "Sho d . any thing be admitted which may give just ground for censure it will immediately be laid hold of &amp; the book will be condemned as containing only worthless indecent fragments, which both he [Burns] &amp; D r . Currie had rejected, &amp; not only wo d . this affect the sale of the work but it wo d . also injure the character of Burns &amp; perhaps depreciate in a considerable degree his other writings for the property of which you have so liberally paid —[.]" Roscoe does not explain, however, why omitting these poems requires scrapping all seven sheets printed so far. Whatever the reason, Cromek has agreed to the judgment. In his letter Roscoe then pours oil on the waters he has so considerably troubled: ". . . I am truly happy to say that in my judgment there is no danger . . . if prudent precautions be taken which M r . Cromek is not only willing but anxious to do. The materials are in fact excellent; &amp; the more I examine them, the more I am convinced they will make a most interesting volume. Every thing is now arranged for its being immediately put to press. . . . [Cromek] will bear the loss himself rather than suffer the present sheets to appear. At the same time he hopes that the exertions he has made will induce you to consider this matter in as favourable a light to him as you can, &amp; that if the work sho d . succeed you will not suffer this unexpected loss to fall entirely on himself." In order to soften the blow on Cromek, Roscoe has agreed "to arrange the materials for the preface"; furthermore, he is quite willing to assist in "the progress of the printing as far as my distance will allow, or rendering any other services which you or M r . Cromek may wish" (NLS; Roscoe's copy is in the LCL. Quoted in Life of Roscoe , I, 457-459). In spite of Roscoe's assertion that the entire contents of the volume had been agreed upon, the fate of "Holy Willie's Prayer" had not yet been determined. Cromek and Roscoe apparently decided at Allerton to submit the poem to a third party, and, accordingly, on April 16, 1808, Cromek wrote to William Creech in Edinburgh 9 asking "if you think 'Holy Willie's Prayer' is admissible," adding, "I confess, that though it bears the impress of genius, yet it does not suit the tone of my feelings from the so frequent recurrence of the Name of the Deity in it." 10 Creech's response was a resounding no to the inclusion of the poem: "Professor Dugald Stewart 11 was with me when I received your Letter. I read it to him, &amp; he was much pleased with y r . Sentiment you express respecting ' Holy Willie's Prayer .' [¶] He knows the Man, &amp; knows the Poem. 12 I asked his opinion about inserting it—his Words were—'Certainly inadmissible.' He said it had found its way into a paltry collection of unedited or posthumous Poems, said to be by Burns, printed at Glasgow, but it gave universal offence, &amp; the Collection never sold. 13 Soon after M r . Stewart, M r .MacKenzie 14 came in—I also read to him your Letter which he much approved of, and agreed in opinion with M r . Stewart. On this point therefore you have strong judgment" (quoted by Cromek in his letter of May 4, 1808 to Roscoe; LCL). Cromek accepted the judgment without demur, stating in his letter of May 2, 1808 to Creech, "The opinion of these Gentleman is Gospel with me— of course the Prayer will not appear." 15 Because "Holy Willie's Prayer" had been previously published, it has fortunately become a part of the Burns canon, in spite of the wishes of Creech, Stewart, and MacKenzie. Indeed, it is one of Burns's most lively and accomplished poems. Its vitality, however, is in its scurrility, a quality which Creech and his associates clearly deplored, along with its blasphemy and bawdry. Since "Holy Willie's Prayer" is the only identifiable work which was banished from Reliques , it is impossible to know the literary worth of other works Cromek intended to include in the volume which met the same fate. Yet the question remains whether other fine Burns poems were lost because they did not meet certain criteria of propriety. While Roscoe was working on the introduction to Reliques , the writer Ralph Rylance wrote to him on April 21, 1808, that he had been hired by Cromek to work on the volume. "My principal occupation with him," he wrote, "was to embody his thoughts into notes to be annexed here and there as illustrations. . . . I shall punctually observe his injunction to disclaim having had any hand in the work, and to keep my coöperation a secret. The merit of the notes is all his—editor loquitur" (LCL). The letter strongly suggests that Rylance ghost-wrote a good number of the notes to Reliques from Cromek. Although it is impossible to know how much Rylance contributed, Rylance's letter raises an important ethical question about Cromek, who in the course of his career was accused of stealing from both William Blake and Allan Cunningham. Was he stealing from Rylance? Or was he merely delegating to Rylance what he considered to be a trifling task? Because Cromek paid Rylance for his labors, he cannot be accused of out-and-out larceny. Yet the force of Rylance's statement about disclaiming his own work and keeping his participation a secret suggests that Cromek wished to claim Rylance's expertise as his own. Roscoe's letter of March 9 to Gilbert Burns apparently did not assuage his fears, since later that spring Burns delegated Robert Ainslie to examine the pieces Cromek had selected. Cromek and Ainslie were hardly companionable, as Cromek's letter of May 4 to Roscoe indicates: "M r . Ainslie who will call on you very soon in his way to Edinburgh is the gentleman (so called by the courtesy of the word) to whom Burns addresses 7 fine letters in the forthcoming Volume. [In fact eight Burns letters to Ainslie are in Reliques .] He has a rage for seeing celebrated Men . He looks on them as he looks on the Lions in the Tower, or on the Wooden Effigies of Gog and Magog in Guildhall. To gratify this craving he is determined to see you , &amp; he has requested me to introduce him. He is a man of some consequence in Edinburgh as a Writer, and moreover—he is perfectly harmless . [¶] M r Ainslie is the particular friend of Gilbert Burns, who commissioned him to call on me and look over my Papers, which commission he has executed with the inquisitional authority of a Spaniard, and with the usual delicacy of a Scotsman" (LCL). More than two weeks later, on May 20, Cromek still believed that Ainslie was perfectly harmless when he wrote to Cadell and Davies that "Ainslie (of Edinburgh) has forwarded a sensible well-disposed Letter from Gilbert Burns" which Cromek will deliver to them tomorrow (NLS). Then, early in June, the printer James McCreery wrote anxiously to Cadell and Davies that Ainslie had serious objection to much of Reliques and that Cromek had left town before the objection had been met: ". . . as far as I can remember his [Ainslie's] objections went to do away [with] the whole or nearly the whole of this part of the work [Burns's Journal of the Border Tour ]. . . . Mr Ainslie went home by way of Liverpool and saw Mr Roscoe, &amp; I supposed conversed with him on this affair. . . . Perhaps therefore the safest way for me to act would be to find [ sic ] M r . Cromek instantly to Bristol at the Post Office. 16 . . . We are now at, or nearly at Press , with this part of the work, . . . I think that time is now nearly expired. I perceive a great deal of ill temper towards you in this letter from the poet[']s relations, and I think you to be very cautious not to let anything be done that might give them cause of uneasiness" (NLS). Robert Ainslie presented his version of his meeting with Cromek in a letter to Cadell and Davies dated June 12, 1808. He went to London, he writes, empowered with written authority from Gilbert Burns, and there he examined the entire Reliques manuscript with Cromek, excising all passages of dubious taste or merit. He found Burns's Journal to be especially in need of excision: "In that Journal many private opinions of individuals are Expressed—which, I Struck Out in the revisal—but I have this moment learned from my friend M r . Ja. Ballantyne 17 —who has come lately from London, that Mr Cromek means to publish This Work —which if he does, I assure you, while he hurts the feelings of many worthy people, he will also naturally injure the work. . . . I must Exceedingly disapprove of such an attempt—This is certainly very strange injudicious &amp; highly improper in the part of Mr Cromek" (NLS). The matter reached Cromek in Bristol, and on June 20 he responded in righteous anger to Cadell and Davies: From the specimen of M r . Ainsley's [ sic ] Inquisitorial Authority exercised over myself &amp; my Papers when that Gentleman (by the courtesy of the World so called) was last in London, I was quite prepared to meet that imperious tone of Voice which he has assumed to you— I have not deceived M r . Ainslie with regard to the publication of the Journal— He has deceived himself. With a caution by no means uncommon among his countrymen, and a vulgarity of taste peculiarly his own, he ran his Pen through one of the finest and most exquisite parts of this valuable Remain, ordering , and requesting , they might be omitted. I then remarked to him, that in so doing, he had not only destroyed the harmony of the whole, but he had rendered the Journal as dull and stupid as if he or I had written it; and I left it for him to determine, whether our Journals would be fit objects of public attention, and curiosity. This Journal has been attentively read by M r . Roscoe; by him approved. It was prepared for the Press with an almost incredible anxiety : Nay, even many of Ainslie's observations are attended to; and except in cases of Persons praised, Initials only are printed— Not one is satirized to gratify splenetic Humour—Not one whipt, who (Ainslie himself acknowledged) did not really merit that kind of Discipline— You must consider what it is that constitutes the value of this Journal, &amp; you will find its leading feature to be Character delineated with a masterly and discriminating Pencil. You will perceive in it independence of Mind, elevation of sentiment, and, in one or two instances, sublimity of Devotion. . . . [Burns's] virtues, his weaknesses pass in review before the Reader; nay the very inmost recesses of his Heart are often exhibited; and is such a Work, so original in its plan, and so intersting in its execution, to be broken down &amp; reduced to fragments by the worse than gothic barbarian of a Scotch Attorney; &amp; to serve the basest of all purposes too,—the hope of bettering his interest with his paltry "south country friends?"— I have been greatly surprized to find that you think the Journal "has many, very many passages likely to give extreme offence, &amp; to discredit both Editor &amp; publishers."—I really cannot tell where they are to be found—I dined yesterday with an eminent Physician here, &amp; a very clever, gentlemanly Man, a Particular friend both of Burns and his Biographer, &amp; who has the good of the work much at his heart. 18 I read the Journal to him : He is decidedly against cutting it into pieces. However I shall hasten to Town &amp; shall very chearfully meet your wishes in every thing ; only Let us be careful that in "plucking out Weeds, we do not destroy the Flowers also ." . . . This should not occasion the least delay—McCreery can go on as usual; as whatever may be cut out can be supplied by Asterisks —(NLS). Cromek's eloquent plea for Burns's Journal did not change the verdict, however, for on July 9 Roscoe wrote in his own long letter to Cromek that "as to the Journal &amp; account of his excursion from Edinburgh it is absolutely &amp; wholly inadmissable. . . . this precious relique . . . in my judgment ought for the sake of both the author &amp; the persons mentioned in it to be committed to the flames" (Roscoe's copy, LCL). It would seem, in view of Roscoe's earlier assurances that the contents of Reliques were entirely settled, that Roscoe's mind had been changed by this "worse than gothic barbarian of a Scotch attorney." Whatever personal opinion Roscoe may have had about Ainslie, he apparently believed it better to honor Ainslie's objections than to risk damage to the reputation of Burns (and indirectly to Currie). No doubt Roscoe had received McCreery's warning that Burns's relatives had generated "a great deal of ill temper" as well, and in banishing Burns's Journal from Reliques he was also following McCreery's advice "not to let anything be done that might give them cause of uneasiness." Cromek replied to Roscoe on July 12 that "Your kind letter of the 9 th . has really confounded me. Your opinion of the Journal is the heaviest blow I have received since I engaged in the Editorship of Burns's book." He rehearses what he had written earlier to Cadell and Davies about Burns's Journal : that other "learned men" have read it "with infinite delight" and agree that it certainly should be included in the volume; that innocent parties mentioned in the Journal have been protected by initials and dashes; that others are exposed to only the ridicule they deserve; that the Journal offers a candid portrait of Burns; that anything in it which could be considered offensive is still less offensive than portions of his letters and poems which Dr. Currie had included in his edition. Cromek adds ruefully, "Not having the remotest idea that the Journal would be objected to in its present pruned state, I did not order the Press to stop and two additional sheets are printed off." Dropping the Journal from Reliques thus involves yet another loss of seventy-five pounds, with an additional cost of twenty to thirty pounds for making the changes Roscoe has requested in Burns's letters and Common Place Book. At this point Cromek vows that "Nothing further will be done 'till I have the pleasure of receiving your sentiments on this subject, which I hope will be at your first leisure" (LCL). Clearly Cromek knew it was hopeless to expect Roscoe to reverse his latest pronouncement on Burns's Journal . Indeed, Roscoe had resolved to side entirely with Ainslie. The day after Cromek wrote his letter to Roscoe, July 13, Roscoe wrote to Ainslie that Cromek had printed "a great part" of Reliques "without my having seen it till too late to suggest any alterations —I have however stated my objections not only to a few passages but to some pieces of great extent, which absolutely must not appear; at least if I have any influence—The more I examine this volume the more I see the necessity of purification, which as it cannot be done by alterations, can only be performed by excision. . . . In these sentiments I am sure you will agree with me; and if anything further sho d . occur to you respecting a publication which the reputation of the Poet is in some degree involved, it will give me sincere pleasure to hear from you" (Roscoe's copy, LCL). The next day, July 14, Roscoe wrote Cromek. The letter effectively puts in jeopardy everything in Reliques they had previously agreed upon: "I assure you that it is with very great reluctance that I intrude my opinion respecting the volume of Burns, &amp; that it gives me infinite pain to be the cause of anxiety &amp; expense to you; but you must be aware that if the work had been forwarded to me in the Proof sheets, as was, I thought, concluded on when you was here, it would have prevented the present embarrassment. . . . Had I been upon the spot it wo d . have been easy for us to have settled matters to our satisfaction, but to debate matters of this kind at 200 miles distance is an inconceivable inconvenience. By the next post I shall return all the papers Poetry &amp;c, &amp; write you fully upon them—till then please to stop further proceedings" (Roscoe's copy, LCL). Again, Cromek capitulated. On July 20, he answered Roscoe's letter in contrite terms: "I should think myself greatly wanting in Respect to your Judgment if I were not to comply with its determination respecting the Journal. It must be cancelled however painful to my feelings, or injurious to my Purse. I must cancel everything as far as W m . Burns's 2 d . Letter, making altogether 4½ sheets" (LCL). 19 Several weeks later, on August 12, Cromek sent to Roscoe "corrected Proofs of all the Poetry as you requested. . . . Among the Poetry you returned whatever you had written Doubtful against, I have not suffered to be printed" (LCL). Apparently the volume was sufficiently cleansed in this state, since no further disapproval was forthcoming from Roscoe or the party of Burns, and it became the final version which was published early in December 1808. Roscoe's caution proved a difficulty to Cromek in one other way. Back on February 12, 1808, Roscoe promised Cromek that he would write "some Remarks on the Dignity and Independence of Genius " to accompany Cromek's Preface. By April 9, Roscoe had decided also "to arrange the materials for the preface." In the months following Roscoe did little if anything to carry out these commitments, in spite of Cromek's pleas for the prefatory material in many of his letters to Roscoe. Finally, on July 2, Cromek wrote to Roscoe's son, William Stanley Roscoe, "I did not like to write to your good father on the subject, but the truth is that we soon shall be almost at a stand still for my Preface to Burns[']s Book. He promised to look it over &amp; revise it for me" (LCL). A week later, on July 9, Roscoe assured Cromek in his letter that "I shall now take the earliest opportunity of looking into the papers which you left with me respecting the preface, &amp; acquainting you with the result." On July 14, Roscoe reported that "I have . . . sketched &amp; arranged the preface, which (if I can get it legibly copied) shall be sent at the same time [i.e., "By the next post"] if not very shortly afterward." Nearly a week later, however, on July 20, Cromek was still waiting for the preface, writing to Roscoe, "I am most exceedingly impatient to see it." He had to wait until August 12 before he finally received the Preface as edited by Roscoe. Cromek had to do without Roscoe's "Remarks," as well as another "Appendage" to the Preface by "M r . Brydge," both of which Roscoe requested he withhold from the edition. No doubt by this time Roscoe did not want his name to appear in the volume at all. The published Preface in fact is the same as a manuscript of the Preface in Roscoe's hand in the Liverpool City Libraries, with minor variations in wording. The single addition of consequence made by Cromek is in the form of an excuse: "As an apology for any defects of my own that may appear in the publication, I beg to observe that I am by profession an artist, and not an author. An earnest wish to possess a scrap of the handwriting of Burns, originally led me to the discovery of most of the papers that compose this volume. In the manner of laying them before the public, I honestly declare that I have done my best" ( Reliques , p. xi). The story actually is much more complicated than that, and Cromek's participation much more involved than his declaration of innocence would suggest. Well before the publication of Reliques , in fact, Cromek had revived his idea of an illustrated edition of Burns, and in a letter of April 21, 1808 to Cadell and Davies he presented his plan of illustrations. There would be five classes: "Views of the most striking Scenery, at once characteristic of the Poems, and of Scotland," Burns's residences, portraits of surviving members of the Burns family, portraits of people "connected with the history of Burns," among them "M r . Roscoe, as having produced the first poem to the Poet's memory," and portraits of characters found in Burns's works (NLS). Less than a month later, on May 13, Cromek outlined in a letter to Cadell and Davies the terms for his editorship of an illustrated version of Burns's works. He designated Stothard as the artist for the illustrations, he specified that another trip to Scotland was necessary for the completion of these illustrations (the expense of this trip to be borne by Cadell and Davies), and, finally, he proposed that he receive "one third share of the profits of the publication &amp; that one third share of the Property shall belong to me" (NLS). In August of 1809 Cromek and Stothard made the trip to Scotland, and for the next four weeks Stothard completed drawing after drawing while Cromek looked for new information about and materials by Burns. On September 5, 1809, Cromek happily reported to Cadell and Davies that Stothard had finished all his drawings and he had found much more about Burns, as well as six new letters by him (NLS). And on November 6, 1809, Cromek, back in London, wrote to Mr. Davies asking for the three hundred guineas, "the sum agreed upon to be paid for the transfer to your House of my plan of illustrating Burns" (NLS). Cromek's edition of Burns never was completed, however, for Cromek's health began to fail in 1810. He was able to edit Select Scottish Songs, Ancient and Modern; with Critical Observations and Biographical Notices, by Robert Burns , published by Cadell and Davies in 1810, including in the edition three of the six letters by Burns he had found the previous summer in Scotland. But he did not have the strength to carry out his more ambitious intentions. He died on March 14, 1812, of consumption. Cromek's Reliques remains his outstanding contribution to the Burns canon—in spite of Roscoe. Burns's Journal of the Border Tour was later published by Cromek's sometime protégé, Allan Cunningham, in 1834. 20 Cunningham's edition also marked the next published appearance of "Holy Willie's Prayer." The other poems and letters excised from the edition and the deleted portions from those included in the edition largely have disappeared. Cromek may well be called an opportunist, and certainly at times it is difficult to determine whether his zeal is more for the poet or for the profit he hoped to acquire as the editor succeeding Currie. Nevertheless, Cromek served the modern reader of Burns far better than the overcautious and equivocal Roscoe. And there can be no doubt, after reading these numerous letters by the major participants, that Roscoe seriously compromised Cromek's Reliques , however well intended his motives. From near the beginning, he worked only to preserve the literary reputation of Burns and to protect the integrity of Currie's edition. As the work moved closer to publication he found the necessity of its purification to be more urgent and more extensive. Shortly after Reliques was published, on December 20, 1808, Roscoe wrote Cromek a coldly ambiguous letter acknowledging the event: "I observe by the papers that the Reliques of Burns are published. I hope they will meet with that reception from the public which I am sure they deserve. Be so good as to mention when you write what Messrs C[adell] &amp; D[avies] think of them &amp; whether they are satisfied with the sale as far as they can yet judge" (Berg Coll., New York Public Library). Of the two, however, Roscoe was closer to the tenor of his times, for certainly his notions of propriety were shared by most contemporary guardians of literary taste. Indeed, when reviews of Reliques of Burns appeared, they praised the very qualities of decency and decorum in it that Roscoe had worked to insure. Francis Jeffrey, for instance, wrote in the January 1809 Edinburgh Review that "the friends of the poet, we are sure, are indebted to [Cromek's] good taste, moderation and delicacy, for having confined it to the pieces which are now printed. Burns wrote many rash—many violent, and many indecent things; of which we have no doubt many specimens must have fallen into the hands of so diligent a collector. He has, however, carefully suppressed everything of this description, and shown that tenderness for his author's memory, which is the best proof of the veneration with which he regards his talents." 21 This virtue belongs to Roscoe, not Cromek, whose primary concern was a sufficient quantity of Burns materials to fill a volume, not their quality Yet Cromek's more venal criterion, coupled with his fidelity to Burns's own words, produced a reliable and worthwhile volume. One can finally only speculate how much more worth while the volume would have been, if not for Roscoe's high-minded protectiveness. 22</field>

He placed advertisements for subscriptions in the Bristol Gazette, and Public Advertiser of June 9 and June 30, 1808. See my "Cromek's Provincial Advertisements for Blake's Grave," Notes &amp; Queries , N.S. 27 (February 1980), 75. 17 James Ballantyne (1772-1833) was a well established Edinburgh printer. In his letter of November 17, 1807 to Constable, Cromek mentions Ballantyne as his intended printer of The Grave . The printing actually was done by Thomas Bensley, however. 18 Probably Dr. Craufuid of Bristol Hot Springs, a friend of Currie. See Thornton, James Currie, passim . Craufuid was also a Grave subscriber. 19 Because it was too late to remove all of Burns's Journal from the press, Cromek made a vertical tear through the three leaves comprising the remaining printed pages of the Journal ; these leaves were then removed before the volume was bound. Some copies, however, survived this fate; one of them is in the Wellesley College Library. See Hannah D. French, "Cromek's 'Reliques of Robert Burns', a Footnote to Egerer 112," The Bibliothek , 5 (1967), 33-35. 20 Cunningham took various liberties with the text, as specified by J.

      <field name="heading_text">Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington : Addenda to Shannon and Ricks by Aidan Day and P. G. Scott</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., and Christopher Ricks have recently provided a very substantial collation of the variants in Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington ( SB , XXXII, 1979, 125-157), four further proof-copies have come to light at the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln. 1 Three were among uncatalogued material in the Centre: one of these is an incomplete proof-copy for the first edition of 1852, with interesting corrections in Tennyson's hand; and the other two are minimally-corrected proof-copies for the second edition of 1853. The fourth is a late set of page-proofs for Tennyson's Maud, and Other Poems (1855); this volume is listed in the Centre's Catalogue, but its text for the Wellington Ode does not seem to have been previously studied. 2 The purpose of this note is to describe these hitherto unrecorded stages in the poem's development, as a supplement to the Shannon-Ricks collation. The Lincoln proof-copy for the first edition is a single octavo gathering (opened), unsigned, and comprising: pp. [1]-[2], half-title (verso blank); pp. [3]-[4], title (imprint on verso); pp. [5]-16, text (with imprint on p. 16). The gathering lacks leaves 4.5, pp. 7-10 (lines 35-131); it is without the paper covers of the first edition; and there are no stitch or stab holes. The leaves measure approximately 8¾” x 5frac916”. This general pattern is, of course, with the exception of the missing leaves, the same as that of the first edition itself, though the paper (white wove, and unwatermarked) is slightly thinner than that in the copies we have examined of 52. The text in the letter-press is also identical to 52, in all but a single variant; in line 170, where 52 and all subsequent states read But wink no more in slothful overtrust. the Lincoln proof-copy for the first edition follows the corrected Lincoln galley-proof for that edition (Shannon-Ricks, 52(p 2 ); autograph corrections, AT/52(p 2 )), and reads But wink no more in overtrust. Further collation shows that this Lincoln proof-copy was not set directly from 52(p 2 ), since it incorporates corrections not present on the galley-proof. At the same time, the variant in line 170 of the proof-copy, together with the lack of stitching, indicates that this new copy is not, as might first appear, an unused sheet, pre-print or 'trial copy' of 52, but a distinct page-proof stage, intermediate between the corrected galley-proof and 52 itself, and it provides therefore a 52(p 3 ) for the Shannon-Ricks listing. The copy carries some of Tennyson's autograph corrections, and these show that it was not the printer's copy used in the final correction for the first edition. For instance, the addition of "slothful" made by 52 in line 170 had not been marked on this copy. As on many proofs surviving among an author's own papers, the corrections seem to have been 'working' or draft revisions, rather than printer's instructions. Indeed, collation shows that the autograph emendations here are associated, not with the 52 text, but with Tennyson's subsequent revision of the Ode for the second edition, published in 1853. The manuscript corrections on the proof thus constitute a separate stage, which simply happens to have been entered on a spare copy of a late proof rather than on a copy of the first edition. The extant corrections in this Lincoln proof-copy occur on two pages only, though there could originally have been more on the missing centre leaves. On p. 12, lines 169-170 and 171 originally read as follows: Till crowds be sane and crowns be just; But wink no more in overtrust. . . . . And O remember him who led your hosts; In the corrections, in line 169, Tennyson has first altered the terminal semicolon to a comma, and then cancelled that for a period; in line 170, the words "But wink no more in" are cancelled, and the line rewritten as "We fool ourselves with overtrust." (a variant with no equivalent in any other text); and in line 171, the initial "And" is altered to "But" (a reading shared with Emily Tennyson's redrafting of this line from the Trinity College manuscript [Shannon-Ricks, TC] in a manuscript fragment [Shannon-Ricks, ET/ 52(a)], tipped into the Pierpont Morgan copy of the first edition). On p. 15, lines 254-255 had read: For solemn, too, this day are we. O friends, we doubt not that for one so true In the corrections, the words "For . . . . friends," have been deleted, and in the margin is written a draft of what eventually became lines 251-255 in the second edition (lines 251-253 being published for the first time in that edition): We revere &amp; while we hear The tides of Music's golden sea Beating on Eternity Lifted up in spirit are we, Until we &amp;c This version of lines 251-255 falls mid-way between Tennyson's separate drafting of the lines on paper watermarked 1852 (Shannon-Ricks, MS 6) and the version inserted by Tennyson in his autograph corrections on the Pierpont Morgan copy of the first edition (Shannon-Ricks, AT/52(a)). There seems no reason to doubt that the other autograph corrections in the Lincoln proof-copy for the first edition also belong to the same general revision-stage, the preparation of the second edition of 1853. The two Lincoln proof-copies for the second edition may be dealt with more briefly. They both consist of a single octavo gathering (opened), unsigned, and comprising: pp. [1]-[2], half-title (verso blank); pp. [3]-[4], title (imprint on verso); pp. [5]-16, text (with imprint on p. 16). In one of the two copies, the Q of QUEEN in the imprint on the title-verso has dropped. The paper in both copies is white wove, unwatermarked; the leaves measure approximately 8¾” x 5frac916”. The copies are without covers, and there are no stitch or stab holes. The text in the letter-press in both copies is identical to that in the Widener proof-copy for the second edition, collated by Shannon and Ricks as 53(p). The only manuscript correction on the Lincoln copies (the same on both) is that line 218 on p. 14 ("He has not fail'd: he hath prevail'd:") has been cancelled, as also in the Widener copy. The fourth set of proofs at Lincoln forms part of a proof-copy for the first edition of Maud, and Other Poems , and provides a 55(p) for the Shannon-Ricks listing. This copy, together with a set of page-proofs for the first edition of In Memoriam , was bought at Sotheby's in March 1891 by G. L. Craik of Macmillan's, Tennyson's publishers. Both copies were presented to Tennyson by Craik, on behalf of Macmillan. 3 The set of page-proofs for Maud, and Other Poems lacks the prelims (Sg. A 1-4) of the first edition, and has a single leaf tipped in (Sg. M, pp. 153-[154]) where the first edition has a final gathering (Sg. M 2 , pp. 153-154, [155]-[156]). Otherwise the proof-copy, which has regular signatures and continuous pagination throughout, is identical in make-up, though not in text, to the first edition. 4 It is printed on white wove paper, unwatermarked, and the leaves measure approximately 6½” x 4⅛”. The present binding (brown morocco with the spine lettered in gilt: "TENNYSON'S / MAUD. / REVISES. / 1855.") and the endpapers of the volume are not connected with the original printing of the page-proofs. In addition to the single Ode correction noted below, the proofs bear quite extensive autograph corrections to "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (text, pp. [151]-153; autograph corrections on pp. [151]-[154]). The Wellington Ode itself is on pp. [119]-136, as in the first edition of Maud, and Other Poems (p. [119], divisional title; p. [120], blank; pp. [121]-136, text). There are four variants in the letter-press from the published 1855 text. In the opening line, the proof follows 52 and 53 in reading Let us bury the Great Duke but this is corrected in Tennyson's hand to the reading of 55 ("Bury the Great Duke"). On p. 125 (line 59), the proof, like 53, has A deeper knell in the heart be knoll'd; as against the reading "And a deeper knell . . ." in 55. On p. 131, the proof ends Tennyson's new version of line 172 ("He bad you guard the sacred coasts") with a colon, rather than the period of 55. On p. 136 (line 267), the proof follows 53 in reading Hush, the Dead March sounds in the people's ears: whereas the March "wails" in 55. The special interest of this group of variants is the very late stage at which they show Tennyson still making revisions to the minor poems of the Maud volume. These additional proof-copies of the Wellington Ode do not, of course, alter the general picture of the poem's history given by Professors Shannon and Ricks, but they do fill in some detail. In particular, the first edition proof and its later manuscript corrections help to document two important stages in the textual development of the poem.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dreiser and the B. W. Dodge Sister Carrie by James L. W. West III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most of the bibliographical attention given to Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie has been directed toward the infamous first edition of the novel, published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. in 1900. But just as interesting in many respects is the republication of Sister Carrie seven years later by B. W. Dodge &amp; Co. This "edition" (actually a reprint from the Doubleday plates) brought Sister Carrie back into the literary marketplace and reintroduced it to the American public. During the preliminary research for the recent University of Pennsylvania edition of Sister Carrie , I discovered much information about the Dodge "edition." Most of these data were of no value in establishing the text of the novel and were therefore not included in the textual commentary of the Pennsylvania edition. 1 The Dodge Sister Carrie has always interested me, however, and I have continued to look into its history. In the essay that follows, I shall attempt to bring together my findings about this very important text of Sister Carrie . Most Dreiser scholars probably know something already about the role of B. W. Dodge &amp; Co. in the textual history of Sister Carrie . Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. first published the novel in November 1900 but made no particular effort to promote or sell it, filling only those orders that happened to come in. Dreiser therefore persuaded another publisher, J. F. Taylor, to purchase the remainder stock and plates from Doubleday, Page in 1901 for $500. Dreiser wanted Taylor to reissue the novel right away, but Taylor was more interested in Jennie Gerhardt , which Dreiser was then composing, and which Taylor had under contract. Taylor also disliked the ending of Sister Carrie and wanted Dreiser to rewrite it before the book was republished. Dreiser, then going through a period of extreme personal difficulty, was unable to complete Jennie , much less rewrite the ending of Carrie , and the plan for republication by Taylor fell through. 2 Dreiser did not forget about Sister Carrie , though. He was determined eventually to have the novel republished, and after attempting unsuccessfully in 1905 to have his friend Charles MacLean reissue the book, he acquired the stock and plates himself in 1906 for $550. Dreiser, however, was financially unable to sponsor the republication of Sister Carrie alone, so he gave copies of the novel to Flora Mai Holley, an early literary agent, and asked her to approach potential publishers. Holley gave a copy of the novel to Benjamin W. Dodge, who read it and liked it. Not trusting his judgment entirely, Dodge sent the book to his friend and business associate Charles H. Doscher in Chicago. Years later Doscher recalled that he had read Sister Carrie in one sitting in the old Palmer House (where, incidentally, some of the scenes of the novel are set). Doscher was much impressed by Sister Carrie and wired Dodge immediately, urging him to take on the book. 3 Dodge and Doscher and a friend William Rickey, who had together formed a fledgling publishing house called B. W. Dodge &amp; Co., invited Dreiser to join their venture. Ben Dodge agreed to republish Sister Carrie , but he was not willing to take much financial risk. Dodge's agreement with Dreiser, preserved among the Dreiser Papers at the University of Pennsylvania Library, stipulates that Dreiser will pay $1,000 to the firm and also sign over all royalties on Sister Carrie to the publisher in return for fifty shares of capital stock (with a theoretical value of $5,000). Dreiser is assigned the title of "Director" of the company and is given an option of purchasing fifty additional shares of stock later on. He is to work for the company part-time, for $35.00 a week, but his salary is simply to be counted against the $4,000 he still owes Dodge for the first fifty shares of stock. 4 It takes no great experience with publishers' contracts to see that Dreiser was not especially well treated here. He was putting up $1,000 of his own money and agreeing to work for stock which, at this point, had no real value. The only way Dreiser could come out ahead was for Sister Carrie to sell widely. Then the firm would make money, its stock would be worth something, and Dreiser's cash and labor would not have been wasted. That Dreiser (who was experienced in the business of authorship) should have signed such a contract shows how badly he wanted his novel reissued. His signing also indicates his confidence in the saleability of Sister Carrie . Once the contract was signed, Dreiser set about promoting the upcoming reissue. Nothing helps sell a book like a bit of scandal, and Dreiser therefore wrote the press releases and advertisements to emphasize the "suppression" of the novel in 1900. 5 He played up Mrs. Doubleday's supposed role in the affair and thus began many of the apocryphal stories about Sister Carrie that have persisted until recent years. Dreiser also seems to have based one of his promotional techniques on the commercial history of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage . Crane's novel was published in America by Appleton in October 1895, and it appeared in England one month later in an edition published by William Heinemann. Book reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic praised the book highly, but the British—for reasons that still remain obscure—claimed to have recognized the book first as a masterpiece. The British press insisted that American critics were only following suit after the English notices had assured them Crane's novel was good. "Like so many American authors," needled the London Academy , "he owes his success to British enthusiasm. It was not until The Red Badge of Courage was brought out in this country, in the autumn of 1895, that America 'found' its author. Mr. Crane would be the first to acknowledge his indebtedness to the English critics and the English public, who, with one accord, forced his name into well-deserved prominence." 6 American critics disputed this claim, and there was much skirmishing in book columns and on literary pages, but the matter was never really settled. Modern scholars have agreed that the American reception of The Red Badge was not so chilly as the British claimed, nor was the English reception so warm. In 1907, however, when Dreiser was drawing up his sales campaign for the Dodge Sister Carrie , the myth was still very much alive. Dreiser, who had been interested in Crane's work for years and who had been influenced by Crane in the composition of Sister Carrie , surely knew the story. 7 He seems therefore to have used a similar approach with Sister Carrie , maintaining that the British reviewers and buyers (by implication more sophisticated than their American counterparts) had early seen the value and importance of Sister Carrie , which had also been brought out in England by Heinemann. Dreiser's claims about the English reception of Sister Carrie became a constant theme in advertisements for the Dodge reissue (Westlake, pp. 79-82). Most of this publicity, we now know, was only half true, and some of it was not true at all. Mrs. Doubleday was not alone responsible for her husband's aversion to Sister Carrie ; in fact, she may have had nothing to do with his initial dislike of the book. And Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. did not actually "suppress" Sister Carrie ; the firm simply did not make a very strong effort to sell the book. And the English press for Sister Carrie was not especially warm, nor were the American notices especially cold, nor were the British sales especially good. 8 (Heinemann, in fact, had miscalculated the popularity of Sister Carrie and had been left with a large remainder stock which he did not finally dispose of until 1912. 9 ) But these stories made good copy, stimulated sales, and eventually became the cornerstones of the Sister Carrie legend. Why did Dreiser start these stories? Was he particularly anxious to discredit Doubleday, or was his memory that poor? Perhaps so, but we must also remember that he had $1,550 riding on the success of the B. W. Dodge Sister Carrie —a considerable sum in 1907. His willingness to bend the truth was caused, at least in part, by the monetary loss he stood to suffer if the novel failed again. Before reissuing Sister Carrie Dreiser decided to make two changes in the book. The 1900 first printing had been fulsomely dedicated to Dreiser's friend Arthur Henry, who had prodded him into beginning the novel, had encouraged him during its composition, and had helped him revise and cut it in typescript. By 1907, though, the friendship had cooled, and Dreiser therefore had the dedication to Henry omitted from the Dodge printing. The other change was designed to avoid unfavorable publicity. While composing Sister Carrie in late 1899 and early 1900, Dreiser had based a passage of description on George Ade's "The Fable of the Two Mandolin Players and the Willing Performer," a short sketch which Ade had originally published in the Chicago Record on 7 October 1899 and had subsequently collected in his Fables in Slang (1899). A reviewer for the Syracuse Post-Standard in 1900 had called attention to Dreiser's crib. Dreiser, anxious to avoid any taint of plagiarism in the Dodge reprinting, therefore rewrote the passage (which appears on p. 5 of the book) and had the new wording patched into the plates. Thus all B. W. Dodge copies were published without the dedication to Henry and without the passage from Ade (Pennsylvania edition, pp. 558-559, 637-638). And there was an addition to the Dodge reprint: color plates were made up showing Carrie on stage, taking a curtain call in her "Quaker Maid" costume, and these were tipped into all Dodge copies as frontispieces. There is a potential bibliographical puzzle involving the remainder stock from the Doubleday, Page first printing. When Doubleday sold stock and plates to Taylor in 1901, 85 bound copies and 250 sets of unbound sheets remained on hand. The surviving correspondence shows, in fact, that these sheets were still in the sealed packing case in which the printer had originally delivered them. By the time Taylor sold stock and plates to MacLean in 1905, only 58 bound copies were left. J. F. Taylor was primarily a remainder house which bought up dead stock from publishers and sold it door-to-door. One may therefore speculate that Taylor's salesmen managed to dispose of some 27 bound copies of the Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. Sister Carrie , probably to unsuspecting housewives. The remaining 58 copies went to MacLean along with the 250 sets of sheets, still in the packing case. Sheets, stock, and plates passed to Dreiser, as we have seen, in 1906. 10 These unbound sheets present some intriguing possibilities. One assumes that Dreiser had the bound copies destroyed, but one wonders if he was tempted to have those 250 sets of unused sheets bound up. B. W. Dodge was operating on a shoestring, and Dreiser and his associates could have saved a few dollars by selling these sheets in new Dodge bindings. This possibility has prompted me, over the past several years, to examine numerous copies of the Dodge Sister Carrie in search of Doubleday, Page sheets in a Dodge casing. 11 I had several potential clues. Something would have to have been done with the Doubleday title page, and there were two possibilities. Either Dodge could have substituted a cancel title page, or it could have had the entire first gathering reprinted. The second possibility is the more attractive, because by re-running that first gathering the printer could have rearranged the imposition pattern to eliminate the dedication page, and he could also have used the altered plate for p. 5 and thus have printed the rewritten Ade passage. But to have reprinted only that first gathering would have caused some difficulty because the Doubleday, Page Sister Carrie is imposed in eights whereas the Dodge Sister Carrie is imposed in sixteens. 12 To have reprinted that first gathering, the printer would have had to impose the plates in eights for a one-time run of only 250 sheets—a short run even by 1907 standards. So Dreiser and his partners seem to have decided that it would be too much trouble to save the 250 sets of Doubleday sheets. At least, I have never seen a copy of the Dodge Sister Carrie which includes the original form of the Ade passage. Such copies may exist, however, and Dreiser collectors and scholars should check all copies of the Dodge Carrie they encounter. Copies of the Dodge reprint are relatively easy to find. Dreiser's promotional efforts paid off, and demand for copies at bookshops was strong. Sister Carrie was widely reviewed, with much mention of its original suppression, and the novel sold well enough for a second Dodge printing to be necessary. Dreiser's early bibliographers put a great deal of energy into differentiating the two Dodge printings, with mixed success. In 1928 Edward D. McDonald revealed the most obvious identifying point; it is on the copyright page where the legend 'PRESS OF | BRAUNWORTH &amp; CO. | BOOKBINDERS AND PRINTERS | BROOKLYN, N. Y.' appears at the foot of the page. The first Dodge impression bears this printer's legend, the second impression does not. McDonald, however, had the order wrong in his statement that the first Dodge printing had "no printer's mark." 13 A year later Vrest Orton straightened out the sequence of printings and noted five different states of the book, all created by binding variants. Orton's descriptions are reproduced below: A: Red woven cloth binding, words Sister Carrie on front cover stamped in gold, and this inscription on the copyright page Press of / Braunworth &amp; Co. / Bookbinders and Printers / Brooklyn, N.Y. B: Same binding, words Sister Carrie on front cover stamped in yellow ink, same inscription on copyright page. C: Same binding, same stamping as (B), no printer's name on copyright page. D: Same binding, Sister Carrie on cover in gold, no printer's name on copyright page. D: Bound in blue woven cloth, same stamping as (A), same inscription as (A). 14 A little study will show that Orton has based his classification on casings rather than on sheets, something a modern bibliographer would not do. What Orton is really describing is two impressions and three different casings, two of which he has seen on both impressions of the sheets. One must remember that we are dealing here with mass-produced case bindings. Dodge apparently had at least two runs of the case prepared in red cloth, one with the title stamped in gold and the other with the title stamped in yellow. The blue casing (E) above is likely from a separate casing run, or it may be part of the gold-stamped run (A), prepared after the shop had run out of red cloth. I have also seen three copies of the Dodge Carrie (all first Dodge impressions) bound in a greenish gray cloth with "SISTER CARRIE" stamped in orange. What all this means is that for the Dodge Sister Carrie , the casing has no relation to the priority of the sheets. Runs of sheets and runs of casings were manufactured independently, and both impressions of the text were probably bound in all of the different casings. It is even possible that some copies were created by mixing sheets from the two impressions, but I have not discovered any such copies by applying standard bibliographical tests. And I have no idea what the priority of these various casings might have been. The first printing of the Dodge Sister Carrie was sold out and, as we have seen, a second printing was executed. Dodge bound up only part of this second impression, however, waiting to see if sales would justify binding up the rest of the sheets. That was a wise decision. Sales did slow down sometime in 1908, and Dodge decided to dispose of its remaining unbound sheets to Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the largest remainder and reprint house in the business. Grosset &amp; Dunlap also received the plates of Sister Carrie . For the unbound sheets, Grosset &amp; Dunlap had its own casing made up—identical to the yellow-stamped Dodge casing except that the foot of the spine now reads "GROSSET | &amp; | DUNLAP". Interestingly enough one finds sheets from both Dodge printings in this Grosset &amp; Dunlap casing, which indicates that some of the sheets from the first printing had never been bound up. Grosset &amp; Dunlap later produced its own impression from the Sister Carrie plates. These copies have an integral Grosset &amp; Dunlap title page and seven integral pages of ads in the final gathering. To complicate matters further I have in my own collection a very unusual copy of the Dodge Sister Carrie in a variant red casing unlike any of the casings described above. This copy seems to be one of a lot prepared for the Canadian market in an effort to move left-over bound copies of the second Dodge impression. The title page of this copy is a cancel printed on cheap pulp stock; the lettering reads as follows: "[within a double-rule rectangle] Sister Carrie | By | Theodore Dreiser | [double rule] | [printer's ornament, intertwined vines and leaves] | Second Edition | Tenth Thousand | [rule] | Canadian Edition | [double rule] | B. W. DODGE &amp; CO. | New York | 1907". The verso of this title page is blank, and there is a tipped-in tissue interleaf between the title page and the color frontispiece. This interleaf, not present in any of the other Dodge or Grosset &amp; Dunlap copies I have examined, was probably inserted to keep the pulp title page (which was sure to oxidize quickly) from ruining the facing frontispiece. Because the original title/copyright leaf is gone, we cannot know if the copyright page carried the printer's legend or not, but gutter measurements confirm that this Canadian Sister Carrie is made up of sheets from the second Dodge printing (see note 13). The title page, in fact, reads " Second Edition "—a designation which in 1907 would have meant "second impression." And the title page also announces that this copy is part of the " Tenth Thousand ," suggesting that in all Dodge manufactured and marketed (or sold to Grosset &amp; Dunlap) some 10,000 copies (or sets of sheets) of Sister Carrie . That is a useful piece of information, because the only other clue we have to the size of the Dodge impressions is a single surviving royalty report from Dodge to Dreiser. This report, dated 1 September 1907, reveals that as of the end of August, Dodge had sold 4,617 copies of the reissue. 15 Unless other records turn up we will never know the sizes of each impression, but it is worth noting that in my searches over the past several years I have found a great many more copies of the first Dodge printing than of the second. One may speculate, then, that the first printing was perhaps 7,000 copies and the second perhaps 3,000 copies, of which possibly only 1,000-1,500 were bound up. The rest of the second printing was remaindered in sheets to Grosset &amp; Dunlap, along with a few sheets left over from the first impression. The unsold bound copies, part of the " Tenth Thousand ," were given a special title page and sent to the Canadian market. This Canadian issue was likely an afterthought. There was apparently no initial effort to address the Canadian buying public—at least Dreiser's most recent secondary bibliographers have found no 1907 Canadian reviews of Sister Carrie . 16 One therefore assumes that Dodge was simply trying to dispose of its left-over bound copies by marketing them north of the St. Lawrence. What do these bits of information tell us about the B. W. Dodge Sister Carrie ? They tell us first that Dreiser was quite eager to have his novel republished, eager enough to buy the plates and sign a poor contract in which he took much of the financial risk himself. And under this financial pressure he was anxious enough for high sales to twist the truth a bit—just enough to stimulate sales. Sister Carrie did well for Dodge: the many binding variants and the various attempts to move unsold copies and sheets show that the Dodge firm (with Dreiser as a director, we must remember) employed a great many strategies for marketing the book. Dodge was successful, selling perhaps 8,500 copies in a fairly short time and placing the unsold stock and plates with a good reprint house which would keep the novel on the market after the initial stir caused by its republication had died down. The B. W. Dodge Sister Carrie constitutes an interesting chapter the publishing history of the novel. The Dodge "edition" was pivotal: it kept Dreiser's name before the reading public, helped create the Sister Carrie legend, and prepared the way for the great success in 1911 of his second novel, Jennie Gerhardt .</field>

They are present as late as 1932 in the Modern Library reprint of Sister Carrie , which is itself gathered in sixteens. 13 McDonald, A Bibliography of the Writings of Theodore Dreiser (1928), p. 34.
