THOMAS TANSELLE In the weeks preceding and following my seventy-fifth birthday in January 2009, I wrote a memoir in the form of a tour guide to my living room, with descriptions of the objects it contains and the associations they have for me. I am delighted that the Council of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia has agreed to publish this memoir in due course, along with some of my other autobiographical essays and pieces on book collecting, as a separate volume. I am also pleased that the editor of Studies in Bibliography, who has long shown an interest in biographical studies of bibliographers, wishes to print a few excerpts from the memoir here. I have selected eleven sections out of forty-five—those numbered 1, 5, 7–10, 13, 17, 18, 22, and 36, which are some of the ones most directly related to the world of books and bibliography. 1 Every room in the place where each of us lives could be called a "living room" because we have spent a portion of our intimate (or nonpublic) lives there and because it fills us with memories of what has occurred within it. But the room specifically designated "the living room" serves especially well, by virtue of its name, to symbolize the role that physical surroundings and tangible possessions play in our daily lives. At least I can say that my own living room constantly brings me in touch with my past because it contains furniture, paintings, porcelain, crystal, books, and other objects that recall people and episodes from many parts of my life. Some of these items would be valuable (in historical or monetary terms) to anyone; others are valuable only to me. The rest of my rooms overflow with such objects as well, but the living room provides a selective index to my experiences. So if I now give the reader a tour of my living room (and the foyer leading to it), I can perhaps convey not only the pleasure I derive from my possessions but also some indication of how one's life story can be partially epitomized in one's accumulation of things. To take this approach to memoir-writing is particularly appropriate for me because I have spent much of my life thinking about the significance of artifacts—objects made by human beings in the past and, through their survival, bringing into the present a sense of their origins and of the previous lives they touched. Many of my writings, either directly or indirectly, reflect an appreciation of how artifacts enrich our lives, both through their intrinsic evidence of human activity in the past and through the associations that have gathered around them over time. When I write about book collecting and book preservation, these points about artifacts are obviously basic, since the emphasis is naturally on books as physical objects. But this focus is of course equally fundamental to my writings about analytical and descriptive bibliography, fields that engage in a special kind of reading—a reading of books' physical details. And my writings about scholarly editing take for granted that the original books and manuscripts conveying verbal texts—and not photographs or digitizations of them—are the essential source materials for studying and assessing the makeup of texts (indeed, that analytical and descriptive bibliography are tools of the process). I make no distinction between my approach to books when I am writing and my thoughts about artifacts of all kinds during those far longer periods of time when I am not writing. Whether I am looking at a first printing of Moby-Dick or a vase from my grandmother's house, I observe an object that was seen and handled by many people before me, one that brings a part of the past into the present. Whether I am examining books in the rare-book room of a research library or looking at the objects around me wherever I happen to be, I am reading physical evidence. The connections between the inanimate and the human are always part of these thoughts. Thus when I look at what surrounds me in my living room, I think of the creative efforts of the individuals who brought the objects into existence; and because these pieces have become part of my life, they also reconnect me to the friends with whom I associate them. Their personal meanings for me form the latest stage in the history of the responses they have evoked. 5 The chest of drawers on which the Gump bowl sits is a late nineteenth-or early twentieth-century piece of mahogany or dark cherry, about a foot and a half wide and three and a half feet high, with six small drawers, inset fluted-column corners, and club feet. It had belonged to Gordon Ray's parents in Indiana and was in his New York apartment (25 Sutton Place South, five blocks from where I live) at the time of his death on December 15, 1986, three months after his seventy-first birthday. (It served as the telephone stand in the room where he sat to read books and to go over dealers' catalogues.) Gordon was one of the great twentieth-century book collectors and a leading scholar of Victorian literature (author of the standard biography of Thackeray ); and as president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from 1963 to 1985, as well as a ubiquitous member of boards of nonprofit institutions, he was a respected force in the cultural world. He had a major impact on my life by telephoning me on December 6, 1977, to offer me the vice presidency of the Foundation. That moment is naturally one that I will not forget: I was standing at the telephone in the front hall of my parents' house in Lebanon , Indiana . (I was on leave from the University of Wisconsin , on a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and was there between trips.) I knew that I would ultimately accept his offer, though I did not do so on the phone (nor did he expect me to). It was indicative of Gordon's self-assurance and decisiveness that he would simply offer me the job rather than ask me to come for an interview. He would not have done so, of course, if we had not already known each other: I had met him at the Grolier Club in the 1960s but did not know him well until I received a Guggenheim Fellowship in the spring of 1969. From then on, I generally saw him on my visits to New York . Shortly after his phone call, I went (on December 20th) to New York to "interview" the Foundation (rather than the other way round), and I accepted the position by phone on the 29th. When I was back in New York for "Bibliography Week" in late January, I had another conversation with Gordon to settle some of the details and began searching for an apartment; Gordon's formal letter of appointment was dated January 30th. The job began on the first of August 1978, and I never regretted my decision. Although I had not been unhappy in Madison, I knew that Manhattan was where I wanted to be—and especially when I had the opportunity to be there as part of an illustrious institution that I admired. In addition, Gordon's presence at the Foundation established it in my mind as a place with a scholarly atmosphere that I would find appealing. Working with Gordon was indeed a pleasure for me, as I knew it would be, since we had much in common—such as a Midwestern background, a love of book collecting, good restaurants, and scholarly bibliography (possibly in that descending order), and an impatience (not to say anger) when confronted with pettiness. To some, he appeared stern and austere, with his physical weight making him seem even more formidable; but, bemused by human foibles, he possessed a fine sense of humor and had a genius for social conversation, which was always incisive and laced with literary allusions (for he seemingly never forgot a detail from the many Victorian novels he had read). His combination of geniality and assertiveness was on display at the many lunches and dinners I had with him (not to mention Foundation meetings, theater evenings, and baseball games), and my memory of him in action remains vivid and satisfying. He named me his literary executor and the co-executor of his estate, and that is how I came to have this chest of drawers—which now contains, along with other things, part of my collection of his published writings. (That collection includes "The Count's" Adventures, the 1945 hardcover "offprint" from the first volume of his edition of Thackeray's letters; the prospectus for his 1947 facsimile edition of Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring; an offprint of his 1953 article "The Bentley Papers" inscribed to John Gordan ; his annotated copy of his famous 1965 essay "The Changing World of Rare Books," with sources of the quotations identified; and his 1968 Christmas card, printed at the Spiral Press, reproducing a Thackeray drawing with commentary.) The Pierpont Morgan Library, his beneficiary, had no use for the furnishings of his apartment, and I saw to it that his oriental rugs went to the Grolier Club, where they still line the fifth-floor hallway. Another of the pieces that came to me was a canterbury, now standing beside a chair near the kitchen door, filled with the Times Literary Supplement (which I have subscribed to for over fifty years and cannot imagine being without) and the New York Review of Books (which I have read faithfully since its inception in 1963, during the New York printers' strike). (The four Hogarth prints that Gordon had given to me are hanging in my bedroom, not the living room, but I mention them to illustrate the evocative significance of every detail of physical objects: the labels on the backs show that the framing was done by the H. Lieber Company of Indianapolis , perhaps during Gordon's undergraduate years at Indiana University; and his name with a Harvard address, 16 Conant Hall, shows that he took the prints with him to graduate school. The Lieber firm is a name I know from my childhood, because our family often went there for cameras and film, as well as framing.) My debt to Gordon for his momentous telephone call could not be adequately repaid. But I made an attempt to do so after his death by writing an account of his life and by editing two volumes of his writings: a gathering of his essays on book collecting, and his Lyell Lectures on the Art Deco book in France . My favorite passage in his work comes from the title essay of the former volume, "Books as a Way of Life." I have quoted it in print several times before, and here it is again: book-educated people of the sort I have been describing are rarely dogmatic. They tend instead to regard the world from what George Eliot in Daniel Deronda whimsically calls "a liberal-menagerie point of view." This state of mind infuriates the fierce partisan, but it enlivens social intercourse, and it holds out hope for the glorious day when mankind will cure itself of the plague of politics. The "literature of power" is above politics, having understanding as its aim rather than victory, and the books that embody it are thus a potentially unifying force in a divided world. There is no better way than reading this paragraph to get a sense of what Gordon was like. 7 When you look to the left of the east-wall closet door in the foyer, you see three framed advertisements from the late 1890s for the Ault &amp; Wiborg Printing Ink Company of Cincinnati , two of them between the closet door and the north wall and the other on the north wall just east of the front door of the apartment. A fourth stands on the floor in the dining alcove. These small posters (about eleven by eight and a half inches), intended to display different colors of printing ink, were designed by Will Bradley , who has received considerable attention as a designer and printer of the American fin de siècle. I have not tried to collect him comprehensively, but I have his periodical Bradley His Book (1896–97) and a few of the small books he printed at his Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts , as well as the books with his binding designs that were brought out by the publishers I do collect, such as Stone &amp; Kimball of Chicago (for whom he did the celebrated binding for Edmund Gosse's In Russet and Silver, 1894). Although he is usually thought of in connection with the 1890s, the geometrically stylized figures of dancers in his work for Ault &amp; Wiborg look forward to Art Deco. The one on the north wall, showing the colors "Bronze Brown" and "Green Lake," and the one in the dining area, showing (more simply) "Blue" and "Brown," were bought unframed in July 1975 at the Old Book Shop on Sutter Street in San Francisco (a shop that always rewarded my visits), and I had them framed, with large colored mats, by Limbert's , my home-town framer (responsible for the framing of most of my turn-of-the-century publishers' posters). The other two Bradley items, one displaying "Bronze Blue" and "Brilliant Lake [red]" and the other "Brown" and "Olive" (this one has the same design as the blue and brown one) were already framed (with colored mats to complement the colors in the posters) when I found them at the Inscribulus Bookshop in Baltimore in September 1983. I stopped in at this shop (along with others in Baltimore) several times during the years when Bill and Nina Matheson lived there, in a large fifth-floor walk-up apartment at 529 North Charles Street, one block south of Mount Vernon Place. (They always needed spacious quarters to house all their books, wines, and phonograph records and still allow for open, uncluttered, serene areas punctuated with vases of cut flowers.) Bill, whose death on June 17, 2004, came far too early, had been Chief of the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress; Nina , whom I still see on her visits to New York for the opera, was the director of the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins . I first met Bill at meetings of the Bibliographical Society of America in the 1960s and became well acquainted with him in the early 1970s, after he had moved to the Library of Congress in 1971 and I was doing research there. Bill was a shy and gentle man, and we hit it off at once, as Nina and I also did when I later met her. I had frequent lunches with Bill whenever I was in Washington , and the three of us had dinner at their house (then in Washington , at 338 M Street, SW), where I was treated to Nina's wonderful cooking and some of the wines from their fine cellar. Many dinners in restaurants also occurred over the years, not only in Washington (where they of course knew the restaurant scene thoroughly) but also in New York and once (as I recall) in San Francisco . Bill's generous interest in supporting my work is epitomized by the afternoon he spent taking me to the suburban warehouse that held the copyright deposits not retained for cataloguing by the Library of Congress, so that we could look for the 1909 pamphlet Sherwood Anderson wrote for his family's paint company in Elyria , Ohio ( An Idea to Establish a Commercial Democracy ). I had discovered an entry for this unknown publication in the copyright records; and although we were not able to find the piece, I remain grateful to Bill for the opportunity to search for it. Both Bill and Nina had an extraordinary knowledge of twentieth-century books and amassed remarkable collections, which (along with their large assemblage of books about books) became the stock for the book business they conducted in retirement. We went on many book-hunting expeditions together, and among their bookseller-friends whom I met was the novelist Larry McMurtry . Although I did not really get to know him, I found his shop, Booked Up, the most exciting one in Washington . In his recent memoir, Books (2008), McMurtry calls Bill "a consummate bookman." ( McMurtry's memoir, by the way, will delight anyone who, like me, made the rounds of bookshops all over the country in the 1960s and 1970s. I also applaud his statement that he regards the formation of his own library as one of his "most notable achievements," for a point I have insisted on myself is that building a collection is an activity of creative research, just as writing a scholarly book is.) An essay of Bill's called "What Book Collecting Is All About" perfectly reflects the depth of understanding of bibliographical and bibliophilic pursuits that he had (and that Nina also has). I have always been pleased to believe that I may have played some role in bringing that essay about. When in 1976–77 I was trying to help Jean Peters form the table of contents of her admirable anthology Book Collecting: A Modern Guide, we both knew that Bill's inclusion was essential; and as the volume finally shaped up, his piece was the opening one and formed the ideal introduction. My own contribution came last, and I think of our book-end positions as symbolizing our conversations, which encapsulated the book world. He was one of only four or five people with whom I have felt a complete convergence of opinions on bookish matters. Although I have warm recollections of several of the authors in Jean's book, Bill is the person I think of whenever I see that book on my shelves. 8 Along the north wall of the foyer, below the "Bronze Brown" and "Green Lake" Bradley poster and running most of the three feet from the apartment door to the northeast corner, is a three-shelf oak bookcase, with a leaded-glass door on each shelf. These three separate, stackable, shelves, with a top and a base, are examples of the sectional "barrister" bookcases from the early years of the twentieth century. (The major brand was Globe-Wernicke , but I also have examples from three other companies.) I have written in an earlier autobiographical essay about how important this wonderful style of bookcase, handsome and well-made, is to my earliest recollections of the house I grew up in. Two of the three shelves in this stack in my foyer are from the family house, and the third (the only other with leaded glass that I have encountered) comes from one of the later batches that I purchased. Altogether I acquired over a hundred of these shelves. A few came from some estate sales in my Indiana home town and from my aunt Mary , who located them in Danville , Illinois ; but my two largest acquisitions came from Chicago and from Madison , Wisconsin . The source of the first was Owen Davies , a bookseller on La Salle Street in Chicago , specializing in transportation literature. His shop was not far from the Newberry Library, where I spent a great deal of time in the late 1960s and early 1970s working on the Northwestern- Newberry Edition of Melville in the spacious room that opened off the west side of the lobby. Once when I was in his shop, he told me about an apartment full of books that he was clearing out. When he mentioned sectional bookcases, I asked to see them, and we went to an apartment that was filled, almost floor to ceiling, with stacks of newspapers and unopened packages of books, leaving only narrow pathways to move through. Obviously the former resident was an obsessive accumulator, for whom bringing home bundles of books was the goal, since he never looked at them again. The bookcases were partly visible behind the bundles, and they were the kind I wanted, so we reached a deal. As a result, I went around Chicago for days in a station wagon filled with rattling bookshelves, until I had time to drive them south to the family house, two and a half hours away. The other large group of shelves came in the early 1970s from Grace Hughes , the widow of Merritt Y. Hughes , the famous University of Wisconsin Miltonits (whose intensely learned performances at oral examinations furnish my most distinct recollections of him). Some of Merritt's shelves were of a brand I had not seen before: they could be disassembled completely, rather than each shelf being an intact unit. When assembled, they are perhaps even more handsome than the others, and they now fill the east wall of my living room. When I lived in Madison , I had only a small number of the sectional bookcases with me. Most were in the Indiana house (a large house, fortunately), where the bulk of my growing collections filled walls in many of the rooms. But in New York I have been able to accommodate a larger part of the collections (though by no means all), and I have eighty-five of the shelves in my apartment: besides the three inside the front door and the twenty on the east wall of the living room, there are seven on the west wall of the foyer, twelve on the west wall of the dining alcove, twelve on the north wall of the living room, three on the east wall next to the door into the hall leading to the bedrooms, two under the Hepburn table, and one next to the sofa—as well as twenty-five in one of the bedrooms. My partner also has eighteen in her house. The only ones remaining in the Indiana house are the sixteen black mahogany ones on the north wall of the living room, where they have stood for as long as I can remember. 9 On top of the three-shelf bookcase in the foyer are four brass pieces. Two of them, a small bowl and a basket with a large handle, came from the family house. The other two are eighteenth-century French candlesticks—or so I was told by Joe Tucker , who gave them to me. Joseph Eagon Tucker , a professor of French at the University of Wisconsin , was one of my first acquaintances after I moved to Wisconsin in September of 1960. I met him one evening at dinner in the Wisconsin Union , and I saw him regularly from then on. He was exuberant, gregarious, and mildly sarcastic. He gave me the candlesticks (eight and a half inches tall, with knob-and-slot candle-ejectors) to help furnish my room at the University Club, along with three watercolors by Nicolas Krycevsky (two of Paris dated 1947 – 48 and measuring ten by fifteen inches and twelve by nine and a half, and one of Venice dated 1949 and measuring fourteen by twelve). Krycevsky, whose illustrations for Gogol's Taras Bulba were published in 1945, was being talked about in Paris during Joe's postwar visits, and Joe was attracted to his work. These lovely watercolors now hang on the west wall of my living room; they and the candlesticks have therefore been in my sight constantly for nearly fifty years, in my two Madison locations and my one in New York . In the summer of 1961, on a trip to the South in his Volkswagen, Joe stopped off to have lunch with me and my parents in Indiana , and he appeared to be in good health. But in December he went into the hospital for tests, and in January and February he returned twice more for extended stays. It turned out that he had leukemia, and he died on March 12, 1962. A year earlier, he had undertaken to prepare a section of the nineteenth-century volume of A Critical Bibliography of French Literature (which, under the general editorship of David C. Cabeen , had begun publication in 1947). Possibly sensing as early as September 1961 that he did not have the strength to complete the task, he asked me at that time to collaborate with him. After his death, I did complete it, writing critical comments on over three hundred articles and books dealing with the English influence on nineteenth-century French literature (culled from two thousand items that Joe and I had earlier identified). I still remember how much time I spent climbing up and down the stairs in the Wisconsin library stacks seeking out the material. My comments on each item were duly typed (by my mother) on the required half-sheets of paper, and the whole was shipped to Albert J. George , the volume editor, at the beginning of November 1962. But that volume of the Bibliography, as it was then planned, never appeared, owing in part to Cabeen's and George's deaths. (The nineteenth century was eventually covered with a different set of contributors in 1994.) I am sorry that Joe's work and his name have no place in this standard reference. Joe was fond of his cousin, the historical novelist Dorothy James Roberts , and I had therefore heard a good deal about her before she came to Madison for Joe's funeral. She was a great letter-writer; and although I was not, we exchanged letters regularly from then until her death in February 1990. My large file of her letters includes her annual mimeographed Christmas letters—normally a dreary genre, but hers were far above average because they dealt with intellectual matters and were written in couplets with Ogden Nash -style rhymes. When I met her, she was about sixty and shared an apartment at 910 Stuart Avenue in Mamaroneck with Kathleen (Kay) Smallzried, a journalist who had written a noteworthy autobiography, Press Pass, in 1940. On one of my trips to New York in the mid-1960s, I visited them for dinner, and the main thing I remember from our conversation is her account of her working routine. She depended on her income from her novels, which at times was considerable, when her books were book-club choices. From 1943 through 1963 she often published books in consecutive years, and rarely did more than three years go by without another book. To keep up this pace, she had a rigorous schedule in which she tried to finish a book within a year, spending half the year reading widely in what had been published on the subject she had chosen and the other half-year writing. Because she was very heavy and could not get around easily, her method of acquiring her source material was to ask a used-book dealer—one of the Gilmans of Crompond, New York —to bring a large batch of relevant books to her apartment, and she bought many of them. At the time I was there, I believe the last such session had taken place, for her last book, Kinsmen of the Grail, came out in 1963. I knew who the Gilmans were because, in addition to their Crompond warehouse, they had a New York shop, which I always visited when I was in the city, along with all the other dealers in that wonderful (and now vanished) congregation of Fourth Avenue stores. I saw her only one other time, in the 1970s after she had moved to Palo Alto with her friend Elizabeth Paschal (who had worked for the Ford Foundation and its Fund for the Advancement of Education). Their pleasant house at 569 Patricia Lane offered enjoyments not available in her Mamaroneck apartment: a yard full of flowers and fruit trees, which delighted her. She had her library there and continued to read and write. One of her projects (since she no longer felt the need to produce novels) was to reread Shakespeare and to write an essay on each play. She sent many of these essays to me, and I found them extremely perceptive and readable. Though she was not able to get them published, I still think they would make a good introduction to Shakespeare for the general reader. Because she had gone to college in Wisconsin , I arranged for her papers to become part of the Newberry Library's Midwestern Manuscripts Collection, and I hope someone in the future will discover her Shakespeare essays there. 10 The books inside the three-shelf bookcase, below Joe's candlesticks, are part of my comprehensive collection of the writings of Fredson Bowers (which includes, besides pamphlets and offprints, dust-jacketed copies of the amazingly numerous books he wrote and edited). Bowers dominated the fields of bibliographical scholarship and textual criticism in the English-speaking world during the second half of the twentieth century; and through his presence at the University of Virginia and his founding of Studies in Bibliography there, Virginia came in some ways to be regarded as the center of the bibliographical world. (His influence on Virginia went beyond bibliography, for as English department chairman and dean he recruited many leading scholars; there is a section headed "The Bowers Era" in Susan Tyler Hitchcock's The University of Virginia : A Pictorial History, 1999.) Some people, it seems, assume that I was a student of his, given the nature of my work, my long association with Studies in Bibliography, and my presidency since 1992 of the bibliographical society that he helped found at Virginia in 1947. The truth is that my schooling was at Yale and Northwestern, and I never took a course in bibliography or editing (I do not believe there was one to be had, in any case). My first contact with him was in 1962, when I sent him a short article on an unrecorded early appearance of Poe's "The Raven." This piece originated in my book acquisitiveness. In April 1961 the Lebanon (Indiana) Public Library (three blocks from our family house) decided to discard its holdings of bound volumes of nineteenth-century periodicals; I could not bear to see them simply thrown away, so I rescued them (several hundred volumes), placing them on the ledges along the outer walls of our basement (where they remain to this day). The lot included one volume of the New York Weekly News, dated January 25, 1845, through January 24, 1846; the number for February 8, 1845, contained a printing of "The Raven"—one that, after research, I found to be tied for fourth place among the early printings. I knew that Studies in Bibliography had previously published articles on Poe, who was one of Virginia's most famous former students, and Fredson accepted it. The next year I sent him a more substantial article, which also grew out of my book collecting. One of the early twentieth-century American publishers that I collect—and perhaps the one I admire the most—is B. W. Huebsch , whose publications included (besides works of Joyce , Lawrence , Anderson , and Veblen ) a weekly journal called The Freeman (1920–24). When I discovered that the Newberry Library possessed the set of this journal that had belonged to Helen Swift Neilson (who financed it), with the authors of most of the unsigned pieces identified, I decided to publish a record of these identifications, which included many well-known writers of the time. Huebsch was then still alive, aged 86, and when I got in touch with him to ask about certain pieces not marked in the Newberry set, he replied that he had a fully annotated set in his apartment and invited me to look at it. The next time I was in New York , therefore, in June of 1962, I went to his Central Park West apartment, where the doorman made sure I knew how to pronounce Huebsch's name ("Hibsh"). I found Huebsch to be charming and considerate, and we had many things to talk about, since I knew his early publications thoroughly and since there was a Wisconsin thread running through them. He had published the poetry of William Ellery Leonard (once a Wisconsin professor, who had lived across the street from where I then lived), as well as Zona Gale's The Neighbors, a book on theater by Thomas H. Dickinson of the Wisconsin Dramatic Society, two volumes of Wisconsin Plays , and several books with introductions by Robert M. LaFollette . Before Huebsch departed for his office (at the Viking Press, with which his firm merged in 1925) and left me to take notes on his Freeman volumes, he told me that his maid would serve me lunch—the gentrification of Columbus Avenue was far in the future, and he thought I should not venture there. For my third contribution to Studies, I wrote a broader article, on the materials for the history of American publishing, with advice on how to use contemporary sources for constructing lists of the output of individual firms (using the experience I had gained in doing the same thing for the publishers I was collecting). From then on, I have published an essay in every volume of Studies, amounting by this time to more than forty essays. My acquaintance with Fredson came mainly through our extensive correspondence. He was known for his long letters (which arrived in envelopes plastered with old stamps of small denominations, which were to be returned to him); and though the letters were largely on bibliographical matters, they contained a remarkable amount of personal information and reflection—as is shown by my use of them in my biography of him. We spoke on the telephone no more than two dozen times, I would guess, and my meetings with him almost certainly numbered fewer than two dozen. Many of them occurred at scholarly conferences, which I have always disliked and have attended (I believe) only on the rare occasions when I was a speaker or was chairing a session. (Indeed, I hate for professional matters to intrude on private times: the last thing I want to do in Christmas week is to attend a convention of the Modern Language Association.) Nevertheless, our paths did cross—in Bloomington , Indiana, for example, in April 1976 (where he gave a remarkable extemporaneous talk at the Howells edition headquarters during a historic meeting between five American and five Russian scholarly editors), and in Lawrence , Kansas , in September 1978 (during an equally historic gathering that brought together editors from the fields of literature and history). Another event, the April 1981 conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship in New York , was the occasion for Fredson's only visit to my living room. And a conference I was delighted to participate in was the one held in Charlottesville in April 1985 to honor Fredson on his eightieth birthday. One of my longest conversations with him took place in the Howard Johnson restaurant that used to be on the edge of the University of Virginia grounds; he was a connoisseur of beer as well as wine, but we sat there drinking undistinguished beer for several hours. Fredson's general graciousness and affability made him a pleasant conversationalist. My reason for being in Charlottesville on that occasion was to examine the manuscript of one of his Stephen Crane editions on behalf of the Center for Editions of American Authors, but our talk ranged far beyond his editing. Another conversation accompanied by copious beer occurred at the pub Fredson favored across the street from the British Museum, during the only time when he and I found ourselves in London together. Although I was not his student, he was a considerable influence on my life, both through his writings and through his hospitality to my work in the pages of Studies. I have criticized a few of his positions, but my disagreements with him are small in comparison to our areas of convergence, beginning with his view of bibliography as history. He was unquestionably a great scholar. His last paper, "Why Apparatus?", was written for a conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship in New York in 1991. When he did not feel up to attending, he asked me to read his paper for him. On April 11, the day of the paper, at about the time I was delivering it in New York , he died in Charlottesville . Among the books by Fredson in the three-shelf bookcase is a perfect copy in dust-jacket of his first book, The Dog Owner's Handbook (1936), now quite a rare item, as well as a copy of the scarce 1940 reprint. (The breeding and judging of Irish wolfhounds was one of his early nonbibliographical sidelines, as stamp collecting and the reviewing of musical records were later on.) Another elusive book is the 1934 volume of the Harvard Summaries of Theses, which includes Fredson's abstract of his dissertation on Elizabethan revenge tragedy. I have J. S. G. Simmons's copy of the first paperback printing (1961) of Textual and Literary Criticism and James G. McManaway's copy of the 1970 printing of the first volume of Fredson's Dekker edition. My copy of his Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964) is inscribed to the great Charlottesville collector of American literature, C. Waller Barrett ("For Waller—and I hope for his pleasure"). Among the many inscriptions to me, I especially like what he wrote in his 1989 Hamlet as Minister and Scourge ("For my good friend Tom ") and in the pamphlet I edited to mark his eightieth birthday: "For Tom , with my warmest appreciation for his being the 'onelie begetter' of these publications." (I also have the copy of this pamphlet that he gave to John Simmons , on which he wrote "Time passes!") The shelves also contain most of my collection of the writings of Fredson's wife, the novelist and short-story writer Nancy Hale (of the old and distinguished New England Hale family), whose work I admire and whose conversation delighted me on the few occasions when I saw her or was entertained by the Bowerses at their Charlottesville house, Woodburn. There is even a connection between her and my collection of Boni &amp; Liveright imprints: the second of her two previous husbands was Charles Wertenbaker , whose novel Boojum! was brought out in 1928 by that firm. Besides inscribed copies of her fiction, her memoirs, and her life of Mary Cassatt, I have (thanks to David Vander Meulen ) the booklets she wrote for the Learning Center in Charlottesville in 1985, including copy number 2 (of 38 copies) of a special edition of Birds in the House, printed and bound by Mary Louise Kemp at Quaternion in Charlottesville . My favorite of her books is The Life in the Studio (1969), an account of the memories stirred by the Rockport (Massachusetts) house where she and Fredson went in the summers—the house built at 358 Granite Street in 1911 by her aunt Ellen Day Hale and then given in 1931 to her mother, Lilian Westcott Hale . Both were painters, and indeed (along with her father, Philip Leslie Hale ) were among the leaders of the Boston artistic community of their time. The Bowers connection was my introduction to these painters, and I have become particularly interested in the Cape Ann artists of this period. I am especially fond of Lilian Westcott Hale's work, and on the many drives my partner and I have made to down-east Maine we have often visited the Farnsworth Museum in Rockland, where one of her best paintings, Daffy-Down-Dilly (1908), hangs. (It was included in the 2008 exhibition marking the sixtieth anniversary of the museum.) And her fine portrait of Fredson in his World War II naval uniform dominates my recollections of the living room at Woodburn. 13 The remainder of the west side of the foyer is occupied by a sectional bookcase seven shelves high, reaching almost to the ceiling. It contains part of my collection of artistically avant-garde and politically radical American publishers between 1890 and 1930, though its contents will soon change, for I am now (late 2008) in the process of giving that collection to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale. Because the whole collection amounts to over ten thousand volumes, I have never been able to house all of it in my apartment—especially since I wanted to devote most of the space to my other large collection (books illustrating the history of bibliography, book collecting, and textual criticism), which is the one I need to have at hand to refer to. In the five years since I began my donations to Yale, most of the books have come from the Indiana house, where the bulk of the publisher-imprint collection has been stored in the basement and the upstairs room that had been my aunt Audra's . The small part that I shelved in New York consists of the publishers of the 1890s and a group of New York (especially Greenwich Village) publishers of the 1910s and 1920s whose output was small. This latter group is what is presently housed in the tall foyer bookcase. There are the publications of Frank Shay , for example, who brought out several pamphlets of plays that had been performed by the Provincetown Players and the Washington Square Players, including early work by Eugene O'Neill , Susan Glaspell , and Edna St. Vincent Millay . A less well-known series, on the same shelf, is the "Flying Stag Plays for the Little Theater," published by Egmont Arens in attractive pamphlet editions with cover illustrations by notable artists. Harry Kemp's The Prodigal Son (1918), for instance, bears a front-cover drawing by William Gropper , one of the Masses-Liberator artists. (A piece of his later hung by my desk at the Guggenheim Foundation, for he had held a Fellowship in 1937.) The books published by Nicholas L. Brown and by Lieber &amp; Lewis featured English translations of European (especially Russian and French) writers. The Sunwise Turn was a bookshop that published a few titles, most famously Pins for Wings (1920), the second of Witter Bynner's spoofs of imagism and other poetic movements. Among Laurence Gomme's publications, distinctive for their use of Frederic Goudy's Kennerley type, are two 1917 books, Eight Harvard Poets, which includes E. E. Cummings and John Dos Passos , and The Newark Anniversary Poems, which includes Ezra Pound. ( Mitchell Kennerley , for whom the type was designed, is another of the publishers I collect and was the founder in 1907 of the Little Bookshop Around the Corner, on 29th Street just east of Fifth Avenue, which Gomme managed for a while and then owned.) Gomme was later the first president of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America (founded in 1949) and was a member of the Grolier Club for over a quarter-century. I went to visit him at his Scarsdale home in October 1964 and took with me one of his books— Clement Wood's Glad of Earth (1917)—for him to sign; he obliged by writing "To / Thomas Tanselle / who flatters the publisher / by liking this volume." He also gave me several of the later, scarcer items that he published or designed. At that time I did not yet know Mary Hyde well and was not aware of another of Gomme's roles: he was the cataloguer in 1945 of the R. B. Adam collection of Johnsoniana , which (through his efforts as agent) was purchased by the Hydes three years later. One subset of these small New York publishers comprises those primarily known for their publication of "little" magazines. I have a shelf of Emma Goldman's anarchist periodical Mother Earth, plus some of the separate pamphlets and hard-cover books she brought out with the Mother Earth Publishing Association imprint, such as Petr Kropotkin's Modern Science and Anarchism (1908) and Mikhail Bakunin's God and the State (1916). Guido Bruno is represented by several serials, including Bruno's Weekly (1915–16) and the Chap Books (famous for the illustrations of Clara Tice and for the November 1915 pamphlet, Djuna Barnes's The Book of Repulsive Women). There are also runs of Margaret Anderson's The Little Review (1914—29), Bobby Edwards's The Quill (1922—24), and Samuel Roth's Two Worlds and Two Worlds Monthly (1925—27). My long runs of the most illustrious of the radical magazines, The Masses (1911–17) and The Liberator (1918–24), are housed elsewhere because of their size and are represented in this bookcase only by some of the very scarce "Liberator Pamphlets," such as John Reed's The Sisson Documents (1918) and Max Eastman's Address to the Jury in the Second Masses Trial (1918). Some equally scarce pamphlets in "Pearson's 25,¢ Library," from the Frank Harris period of Pearson's Magazine, are here (such as Harris's Stories of Jesus the Christ of 1919, with a contribution by Bernard Shaw ), along with books from the Pagan Publishing Company, publisher of The Pagan (1916–17). I have not named here every one of the small publishers in the bookcase, but perhaps enough to suggest why I regard these seven shelves as a distillation of the collection as a whole, since the interests manifested by these publishers are largely those of the other publishers I collect. I see these books many times every day, as I pass through the foyer, and I am thus constantly reminded of what I have put together—and, indeed, of the process of assembling it, for I can remember where I found many of the books. I can see myself buying Mary Carolyn Davies's The Slave with Two Faces (Arens, 1918) at Max Hunley's shop in Beverly Hills; Albert Adès and Albert Josipovici's Goha the Fool (Lieber &amp; Lewis, 1923) at Maggie DuPriest's shop in Coral Gables ; Ernest Dowson's Dilemmas (Gomme, 1914) at the Reifsneiders' Park Book Shop in Washington; a presentation copy of John Jay Chapman's Cupid &amp; Psyche (Gomme, 1916) at Dauber &amp; Pine on lower Fifth Avenue; and Selected Works of Voltairine de Cleyre (Mother Earth, 1914) at the Safari Bookshop in San Diego . When the books in this bookcase go to Yale, they will be replaced by parts of my books-about-books collection now stored on closet shelves and floors. Scenes of buying books will continue to enter my mind when I am in the foyer, but they will be different scenes. 17 The next framed item, to the left of the Cummings self-portrait, is an original signed ink drawing (seventeen and a quarter by eleven and a half inches) by Art Young, a prominent cartoonist in the early twentieth century, who first came to my attention in 1958 when I was reading through all the issues of The Masses and The Liberator in connection with my work on Floyd Dell . Young contributed numerous cartoons to both magazines, expressing his (and the magazines') radical views with sarcastic humor, and I was delighted with them. One of my favorites among the books in my Boni &amp; Liveright collection is Young's Trees at Night (1927), which brings together a series of his drawings that depict trees in animal and human shapes (most of which originally appeared in The Saturday Evening Post). The next year Horace Liveright brought out Young's appealing autobiography, On My Way. Over the years, I picked up various other publications of his, such as his 1904 portfolio of five so-called "gravuretype" reproductions, entitled The Arthur Young Cartoons and published by the "Patriotic Art Co." I was therefore pleased to discover about 1990 that the Argosy Book Store on 59th Street had material from Young's estate, and I bought not only the drawing now on my bookcase but also a 1928 letter from Liveright to Young concerning Trees at Night. The drawing, in conformity with Young's criticism of a capitalist ethos, depicts tall office buildings as dehumanizing machines: each has a big lever on the side controlling a large door at ground level; the picture shows the moment when the doors are opened and masses of human beings come tumbling out. This Young drawing takes me back to my graduate-school days at the Newberry Library, since that is where the Dell papers are located and where my discovery of Young and the other Masses-Liberator artists took place. For many weeks in 1958–59, I worked in the Special Collections department on a daily basis, at a time when the novelist Josephine Herbst (a contemporary of Dell's) was also using the manuscript holdings in connection with a book she was planning on the 1920s. I was given a desk in the stacks, next to the one used by the cataloguer of manuscripts, Amy Wood Nyholm (wife of Jens Nyholm , the head of Northwestern University Library). She was a sweet woman, but with an occasional wild laugh and a glint in her eyes, and she had firm opinions on many subjects. Her mothering instincts took over, and she gave me copious advice about the conduct of my life, interlarded with favorite quotations (especially from William Sheldon's The Varieties of Temperament and Vilfredo Pareto's fascist writings), which she had ready to hand on note cards in her top desk-drawer. One day in my bookshop browsing I bought a copy of a small volume of her husband's Danish poetry, Portal til Amerika (1953). When I mentioned it to her, she seemed surprised and said she would love to see it. I gave the book to her but was left to wonder what kind of relationship she and Jens had. Two decades later, at the time of my appointment to the Guggenheim Foundation, she (then retired in Santa Barbara ) wrote to Gordon Ray , congratulating him on choosing me. She compared me with her cousin, who "went forth" from Oxford to "represent the Empire" to the Raj . "Now," she said of me, "he has met a Raj and the Raj has recognized him." Gordon's reply thanked her for her "interesting" letter. 18 Another concentrated period of Newberry work began a few years after the first, in the summer of 1965, when the Northwestern-Newberry Melville Edition got under way; and my memories of that time are released by the object standing in front of the Young drawing: a small Japanese-made clock set into the flat side of a five-inch semicircular column of black Kilkenny marble. This clock had belonged to Rick Johnson , a Newberry staff member who was officially the liaison between the library and the edition and who became a close friend of mine. Rick bought the clock on one of the trips he later took to Ireland with his companion Dick Seidel, and Dick gave it to me after Rick's death from lung cancer in October 1998, at the age of fifty-nine. Visits to Ireland had a special meaning for Rick because his mother was descended from the Colleses (Rick's full name was Richard Colles Johnson ), a distinguished Irish Protestant family that over four centuries and in three countries ( Ireland , England , and America ) made significant contributions to publishing, medicine, cartography, copyright law, and musicology. William Colles , for example, was a publisher whose name appeared on the Dublin editions of many major writers in the last third of the eighteenth century; and Christopher Colles was the author of the first American road atlas (1789). Rick assembled portraits, books, and manuscripts that documented the Colles history, and after his death Dick prepared the collection for the Newberry . I spent extended periods at the Newberry in the summers of 1965 and 1966 and in the spring and summer of 1967 (generally staying at the Pearson Hotel, later razed to make way for Water Tower Place). Rick was an ideal colleague, for he fully understood the bibliographical requirements of an edition like the Melville and was ready to purchase for the library the multiple copies that we needed of Melville's nineteenth-century editions. Indeed, he was one of that small group of people I mentioned earlier whose views on all bibliographical matters I completely agreed with. Another link between us was that we were both Yale graduates (six years apart) who knew the Yale library thoroughly—though I did not at that time know that my collection would go to the Yale Collection of American Literature, where he had held a job as an undergraduate (assisting Donald Gallup ) and had developed his interest in working with books. After our day's work at the Newberry , we often spent the evenings together in the bars and restaurants (ranging all the way from Biggs to Papa Milano ) of the Near North Side. (We also had many lunches with members of the Newberry and Melville staffs, and I have fond memories— probably shared by few others-of Rickett's , a family-run restaurant on Clark Street a few steps north of the Newberry , where one of the seasonal specialties was stewed rhubarb, prepared exactly as my mother had done with our back-yard rhubarb.) During this period I was picking up large quantities of Little Blue Books, the widely distributed five-by-three-and-a-half-inch pamphlets (published by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius ) that brought good literature, as well as radical and freethinking works, to a vast audience for some forty years (1910s to 1950s). Rick became interested, and he and I catalogued and analyzed my collection together, usually working at the kitchen table in his apartment near the Newberry at 27 East Bellevue Place (a building now demolished for so-called luxury apartments because of its proximity to the Lake Michigan Gold Coast). Both our names were on the long article that resulted, published in the First Quarter 1970 number of the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America . (This article was recently—in 2005—reprinted in the journal of the Haldeman-Julius Collectors Club, the existence of which shows how much more interest in the Little Blue Books there is today than there was when we worked on the article forty years ago.) Even after these concentrated periods at the Newberry in the 1960s, I drove down to Chicago from Madison frequently, spending weekends (beginning on Thursdays) at the Newberry for work on Melville and other projects. Rick and I continued to spend many evenings together—joined by Dick, after Rick moved to Dick's Briar Place apartment, about three miles north of the library. But Rick's role in my life was not entirely social, as our Haldeman-Julius work indicates. Rick kept my various research interests in mind, and he continually directed me to relevant sources; whenever, to the end of his life, he came across something he thought would be useful to me, he sent me notes about it. And he came across a great deal, for he constantly read dealers' catalogues and many journals, and he followed up on questions raised by them, or other staff members, or scholars' inquiries. Slips of paper with his handwriting still come to the surface as I use my files. In writing a tribute to him for the Spring 1999 number of The Book Collector, I pointed out that he had "the intellectual curiosity and indefatigable persistence characteristic of first-rate scholars." Since he published little, his scholarship manifested itself largely in his enrichment of the Newberry's collections and in "the innumerable details in many scholarly works (notably the Melville edition) that bear silent testimony to his insight" (as I put it in 1999). My own writings are a prime example: they contain hundreds of references and connections that came from him. 22 What comes next is one of my favorite pieces of my aunt Audra's , which I remember seeing on top of a bookcase in her Bridgeport living room during all my Yale years. It is a colorful ceramic inkwell (early 1930s) bearing the "Anzac" pattern (a classic Art Deco design) from the old C. T. Maling firm of Newcastle-on-Tyne . The central ink compartment, with its lid, and the saucer-like ledge surrounding it are covered with a bright yellow, interrupted by jagged V-shaped multicolored bands. Another stack of books to the right of it is surmounted by a rectangular glass paperweight, four by two and a half inches, of the kind frequently used for advertising in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The bottom surface, visible by looking through the glass from the top, bears an advertisement (in black printing on a white background) for the Babcock Printing Press Manufacturing Company of New London , Con- necticut; it shows a picture of the "Optimus" press and gives the address of the company's New York office as the Tribune Building. The paperweight was made (as indicated on the bottom) by the Barnes &amp; Abrams Company of Syracuse, which patented it in September 1889. I must pause over this paperweight, for it was given to me by Harrison Hayford , the great Melville scholar who was one of the most influential people in my life. When he died in December 2001, I had enjoyed a close relationship with him for forty-six years, beginning with the first seminar I took in graduate school. He was thirty-nine at the time of that seminar, a tall large-boned man, already balding. I associate the smell of smoke with the class, for professors (including him) and students smoked during class in those days (even within the Northwestern University Library, where the seminar was held). Although I learned a lot about Melville and close reading that term, what most impressed me about him was the combination of his openness to all kinds of ideas and the logical rigor with which he analyzed them. I witnessed that logic in action repeatedly over the decades that followed, and I can say that he surpassed anyone else I have known in the instant sharpness of his cutting through any illogical statement, whether in a scholarly discussion or in casual conversation. One moment that sticks in my mind is the time when I was telling him about a congratulatory letter Fredson Bowers had sent me on my move to the Guggenheim. Fredson regretted, he said, that he had already held his "statutory" two Fellowships now that he had a "friend in court." Harry immediately retorted, "Obviously he didn't need a friend in court." Even his jokes and anecdotes—and he was a good story-teller--often played with logic, as did his reiterated comment, "That job took me longer than I expected, but I expected it to." His sense of humor manifested itself in many ways; one of them was his friendship with Walter B. Scott , a Northwestern professor of theater who was as amusing in conversation as in his published parodies. Harry and Walter and a circle of friends met regularly for lunch at Michellini's, a few blocks west of campus on Foster Street, and I was glad to be an attendee at a number of these gatherings in the 1960s and 1970s. A sense of what took place can be gleaned from one of the books in the stack under Harry's paperweight: Scott's Parodies, Etcetera &amp; So Forth (Gerald Graff's 1985 edition of Scott's collected parodies and line drawings, originally published in 1978 as Chicago Letter and Other Parodies). This delightful book contains many references to " Professor Mosher " (to whom the 1949 "Academic Letter of Recommendation" is addressed) or "Bernard Mosher" (who turns up in "Chicago Letter" of 1949 and in "A 'Bob' Brown Sampler" of 1973); once you know that Harry's middle name was " Mosher ," the inspiration is clear. (Harry himself cited his invented character " Bernard Mosher " in occasional footnotes.) When Hershel Parker collected Harry's essays in Melville's Prisoners (2003), he used as a frontispiece Walter's drawing of Harry standing behind a classroom desk holding a small whale—which had originally appeared at the end of Walter's "Fulbright Report." My paper for that first seminar became my first published article: it was based on a trip I made to Galena, Illinois, to find out what might be learned from the local newspapers about Melville's time there in the summer of 1840 to visit his uncle Thomas , and it was illustrated with a photograph I took of the uncle's house. I did not at that time, however, intend to become a Melville scholar; and when I wrote my dissertation a few years later, I chose Harry as my adviser even though my subject was Floyd Dell , not Melville . (I decided on Dell in order to have the experience of working with an author's papers, and in this case of being the first person to go through the archive, recently arrived at the Newberry .) It is possible that I might not have seen much more of Harry after that if he had not telephoned me one evening in August 1964. I was visiting my parents, and I took the call at the same phone on the front-hall desk where I later received Gordon Ray's invitation to join the Guggenheim Foundation. Harry's call (like Gordon's ) was for the purpose of issuing an invitation: he asked me to join a project he was organizing, with the goal of producing a full-scale fifteen-volume edition of Melville's writing, to be funded in large part by Northwestern University and the Newberry Library. I was to be one of three primary co-editors (along with him and Hershel Parker , another of his former students, who was to become the leading Melville scholar), with particular responsibility for bibliographical and textual matters (though all three of us would jointly decide on textual emendations). Harry thought of me because of the bibliographical writing I had done by that time, and I was delighted to embark on such an undertaking with him. (The timing was good, since I had just finished writing my critical biography of Royall Tyler.) Work began in earnest the following summer, and for the next thirteen years I saw a great deal of Harry , when I went down from Wisconsin for long weekends (and sometimes, as I mentioned earlier, whole summers and semesters) at the Newberry . After my move to New York , I saw him less often, and our discussions about the edition took place largely by telephone and mail, though I made a point of going to Chicago for a few days every summer, and he visited me in New York several times. Throughout, from 1965 onward, he and I went to used-book stores together whenever we had the chance (usually in Chicago , but sometimes in Boston and New York ). He had been a book collector before the Melville project began but had generally limited himself to books by and about Melville and other major figures in American literature. After the project got started, he turned his Melville holdings over to the Newberry , where they became the nucleus for the great collection that was built up over the next decade. Harry then needed other collecting goals to satisfy his acquisitiveness, and he began forming impressive assemblages of American poetry, fiction, and humor, and books by American women and blacks. Before long the four floors of his house and the garage were filled, and he became a quasi-dealer, selling several large collections and allowing certain people to buy individual items. His house, at 1010 Elmwood in Evanston , was in some respects the best bookshop in the Chicago area, and I certainly acquired many titles from him. (He always saved for me anything he thought I would be interested in and had a stack of books waiting whenever I showed up.) It was because of his bibliophilic activities that I published my obituary tribute to him in The Book Collector as well as in Leviathan (the Melville Society's journal). Harry and his wife were gregarious: they had many parties in their house and always welcomed graduate students there. So I was familiar with the house even before the Melville Edition began, but it was after that time when I was there much more often and got to know Harry's wife, Jo , well. She was a cultured, cosmopolitan, elegant woman, the daughter of Charles F. Wishart , a former president of the College of Wooster in Ohio . Her knowledge of art history was extensive, and she taught the subject (drawing on her and Harry's many long stays in Europe ) at Kendall College in Evanston . (She was known by many Northwestern undergraduates as a result of being a tutor for members of the basketball and football teams.) When Harry and I had spent an afternoon in the Chicago book shops, we sometimes ate in a restaurant, but often he phoned Jo to say that we would be at the house for dinner. She had obviously become accustomed to providing dinners on short notice. Harry was genial and compassionate, but he could also be impatient and had an easily provoked temper. He once gave me his own analysis of his self-assurance: he did not, he said, feel the need to prove himself, as so many academic strivers did, because he had grown up as a member of one of the leading families of his home town. The family had prospered in business, construction, and dairy farming (he had a farmer's physique himself); and I have several times visited Belfast , Maine , and seen the evidence, in the form of a four-story building at a prominent intersection on Main Street, a few blocks up the hill from the waterfront, with " Hayford Block. 1866." cut into the stone at the top. This building, also called " Hayford Hall," originally had a ballroom and theater on the second floor and was for many years the center of social life in Belfast . And there is a Hayford Corner three miles west of Belfast on Route 3, at the junction with Jesse Robbins Road. ( Walter Scott's 1949 parody of Sherwood Anderson , "The Book," tells of a book-loving young farmer from Maine named " Harry .") I believe I taught Harry some things about the collecting of books, but he taught me more important lessons about how to think and how to deal with daily life. 36 And then, in these east-wall bookcases, there is John Carter . Two and a half shelves are devoted to him, and the equivalent of at least two or three more are represented by stacks of books elsewhere. My collection includes nearly all the printings, English and American, of the eight editions of his ABC for Book-Collectors (1952), the last three editions of which were revised by Nicolas Barker . I also have, besides all the printings of his other books, a number of books from his library (with his Reynolds Stone bookplates and often with his annotations and laid-in clippings and typescripts), as well as many pamphlet items and other so-called ephemera. Among the rarer items are John Sparrow's copy of the page proofs for Carter's 1932 edition of Thomas Browne's Urne Buriall and The Garden of Cyrus (a book regularly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of twentieth-century bookmaking), with Carter's marginal corrections; the order form for An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets (1934), his and Graham Pollard's exposé of the Wise-Forman forgeries and a true bibliographical classic; the hardcover, interleaved issue of his More Binding Variants (1938); the proofs of his Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting (1948), with the title-page date "194" (before the year was certain); part 2 of the Mill House Press Catullus , which he and Edward Gathorne-Hardy edited in 1953; all six of the delightful Halcyon Booklets (1964–66), which he edited under the imprint of the Halcyon-Commonwealth Foundation (at 1 Beekman Place, a great apartment house around the corner from my own and the home of Mary Jean Kempner Thorne , who financed the booklets); and the leaflet he had privately printed, when he was president of the Bibliographical Society, containing the texts of his citations of Graham Pollard and Fredson Bowers on the occasion of their being awarded the Society's Gold Medal in 1969. I had heard of Carter at least by 1953, when my parents gave me as a Christmas present a copy of the second American edition of the ABC (which bears my first bookplate, consisting of my entwined initials in lower case, designed by Betty Sullenberger , the art teacher at my aunt Mary's high school, who created the posters for her plays). Given Carter's prominence in the mid-twentieth-century Anglo-American book world (first at Scribner's and then at Sotheby's ) and his authorship of several classic books, I would certainly have collected him even if there had been no personal association. But I knew him for the last ten years of his life and will always be grateful to him for the kindness he showed me. I first met him in August 1966 when I made a trip to London on behalf of the Melville Edition. Jim Wells of the Newberry , who knew everyone in the book world (and still does), had written a letter to Carter in June asking if he would assist me in gaining entry to the archives of the publisher John Murray , which contained the records relating to the English publication of Melville's first two books. Jim enclosed a letter from me to Carter explaining what I needed, and Carter turned it over to Murray , who wrote me to say that the ledgers would be available to me. I reported this to Carter in a letter on the first of August, telling him that I would be in London to work with the material two weeks later, and his prompt reply asked me to meet him for lunch on the 16th. I showed up at Sotheby's at 12:30 on the appointed day, and he took me to lunch at the Westbury Hotel, a few steps down St. George Street from the back door of Sotheby's . His charm and elegance were well-known, and I was not surprised by them (or by his monocle); but I also found him to be extremely kind and considerate. He even offered to come to Murray's and help me carry the ledgers up the street to get them photocopied. I told him that I was going to have a photographer come in to Murray's , so that the ledgers did not have to leave the premises. But I was very touched by his offer. A few days later he came to Murray's to see how things were going, and we had a drink in a small sidewalk cafe a few doors north along Albemarle Street. I recall that our conversation covered—among many other subjects— Noël Coward and the beauty of Savannah , Georgia (which I had recently visited and where John's wife came from). In subsequent years, whenever I have passed by that cafe, I have thought back to the time when John and I chatted there. I told him that I was working on an article about the description of the colors of nineteenth-century publishers' bindings, a subject he (as one of the pioneer students of those bindings, along with Michael Sadleir ) had long been interested in. The article was published a few months later, in the 1967 volume of Studies in Bibliography, prompting some letters from him in the spring of 1967, including one stating that the "learned reviewer" of that volume for the Times Literary Supplement was "sufficiently conscientious to want to see" the color chart and dictionary that I had recommended. He was asking on behalf of Philip Gaskell (in those days of anonymous TLS reviews), but his request also reflected his own lifelong effort to keep abreast of bibliographical advances. My next flurry of correspondence with him occurred about fifteen months later, when he not only agreed to write a letter of reference to support my application for a Guggenheim Fellowship but also invited me to read a paper before the Bibliographical Society in London , of which he was then president, during the 1969–70 season. I readily accepted his offer and proposed as my topic the history of book-jackets, a choice he heartily approved, for he had written on the subject himself many years earlier. After learning that I had received the Guggenheim for the 1969–70 year, I was able to set the dates of a visit to London , and we agreed on March 17, 1970 (the date of the last meeting of the Society that season), as the day of my talk. I arrived a week ahead and immediately sent him a copy of my paper, and he quickly responded (on the Thursday preceding the Tuesday talk), with a note to my hotel expressing his admiration for the piece. No doubt he was relieved that it was acceptable, for he reported that "there were a few sniffs among the stuffier characters [of the Society's council] when your topic was announced (by me, with enthusiasm), as if such things as dust-jackets were a trifle frivolous—and this should blow them out of the water." During my stay in London , we had another Martini-accompanied lunch at the Westbury , and he invited me to a dinner of the "Biblio Boys" at the Garrick Club. (The "Biblio Boys" were an informal monthly dining group that has an honorable place in the history of twentieth-century bibliography, its regular members having included Michael Sadleir , John Hayward , Percy Muir , Simon Nowell-Smith , and Graham Pollard , among others.) The special guest on this occasion was Sir Robert Birley , former master of Eton (the school in John's home town, which he had attended and to which he remained loyal). I had not previously been to the Garrick Club, though I have been there many times since (as a member of the Century Association in New York , which has a reciprocal relationship with the Garrick ); but no visit there will ever mean more to me than the one John was responsible for. He and I continued to correspond after I returned home, and in August 1971 he asked if I had suggestions for revisions to be made in the new edition of the ABC that he was working on. In two letters, at the beginning of September and of October, I sent him many suggestions. When the fifth edition came out in the summer of 1972, he sent me an inscribed copy ("for Tom Tanselle / gratefully / from John Carter ") and acknowledged my help in his preface. (I have since done the same thing for Nicolas Barker , during his preparation of the eighth edition.) When I was in London in May of 1974, John and I had another (and, as it turned out, final) lunch at the Westbury . Since I had seen him last, he had suffered two small strokes (in 1973), and it was distressing to find him no longer capable of the witty repartee he had always excelled at. I prefer to remember our earlier conversations—such as his reply to my question about how the revision of the Enquiry was going: "At what is known as Pollard's Pace." No doubt this was a well-rehearsed comment, but the intonation and pauses with which he delivered it remain in my mind as the embodiment of his cocktail-party conversation. I did not get to know his wife, Ernestine , until after his death (on March 18, 1975, seven weeks short of his seventieth birthday). For the next five years she and I exchanged a considerable number of letters; the ones in 1977 related to Jean Peters's and my proposal that Jean's anthology Book Collecting: A Modern Guide be dedicated to John . She was delighted, and when the book was published in early November 1977 Jean and I sent her a copy inscribed by each of us. My inscription read as follows: "For Ernestine Carter —with satisfaction in contributing to a book dedicated to Jake , one in which chapter after chapter acknowledges the great debt all book collectors and bibliographers owe to him. I hope the book is one that he would have approved of. With all good wishes from Tom (of Chapter 12) 4th Nov. 1977." ( John was known to his friends as " Jake .") The reason I can quote this inscription is that in 1998, five years after Ernestine's death, Maggs had this copy for sale, and I could not resist the idea of reclaiming it. The shelf where it now resides contains copies of the books that Ernestine herself published, such as her autobiography With Tongue in Chic (1974)—the title reflecting her career as fashion editor of The Sunday Times, where she was a powerful force in the London fashion world. (Before she married John in 1936, she had been at the Museum of Modern Art in New York , first as secretary to Philip Johnson and then as Curator of Architecture and Industrial Art; during that time she lived on 50th Street near the East River, a fact that adds to the pleasant associations my neighborhood has for me.) When I had lunch with her at the Park Lane Hotel in May of 1978 (while my parents, whom I had taken to Europe for their first and only trip, were on a bus tour), one of the things we talked about was my plan to write a biography of John and an assessment of his work, accompanied by a list of his voluminous writings. (He was a great stylist, and nearly everything he wrote, even brief letters to editors, is a delight to read.) I have a substantial mass of material and am sorry I did not complete the task before Ernestine died. I still have not completed it (as of this writing, in early 2009), but I have not given up the idea of paying homage to him in this way. The Carter study is only one of several long-planned and extensively researched projects that I have not yet finished, given the nonscholarly activities that I have preferred to spend time on. But I did finish my memoir, at least within the strict limits I set myself, focusing on the objects in a single room. Even in its entirety (of which the present excerpts amount to about one-fourth), it does not of course cover my life thoroughly; but no memoir ever tells the whole story of a person's life and thoughts. What I hope it does is to suggest how much can be learned by following the associations inspired by a group of objects that one has lived with. ORIENTATIONS TO TEXT, REVISITED by Dirk Van Hulle and Peter Shillingsburg * Our initial purpose was to add a "genetic orientation" to the list of orientations presented in Shillingsburg's Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age, 3rd ed. (1996): documentary, sociological, authorial, bibliographic, and aesthetic. How-ever, in working through them to add a genetic one, we discovered ways to improve the original design. We offer here a re-orientation to orientations to text. 1 Definitions and a Rationale The words "text," "work" and "document" are often used interchangeably. "Text" in our essay means the sequences of letters, spaces, and punctuation that do or can represent a literary work in part or in full. The text of a document, when reproduced accurately, creates a new document with the same text; but a single document can have two or more texts, initial and revised, for example. A work is represented more or less well by each of its variant texts. Depending on one's orientation to texts, one values all texts equally or some over others. The variant texts of a work, and the form, nature, and history of its documents, constitute a complex array of facts, offering opportunity for development of inferences about the history and condition of the work, and offering support for variant critical understandings of a work. The particular way a textual scholar organizes and values complex textual factors-the scholar's orientation-affects how the work is understood. The elemental materials, facts, and forces involved in the original production of literary works and then in their revision, reproduction, and dissemination are material, causal (agents), temporal, genetic (inventive), and performance. Another element now seldom encountered in scholarly textual discussions is aesthetic / commercial —normally excluded because it is often confused with "flavor of the month" value. An orientation identifies a perspective that reveals the relative importance of these elements for a given purpose. None can be neglected but not all are of equal importance to each reader or editor; hence the varieties of approaches to scholarly textual tasks and disagreements about how to understand * The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement n° 31360911. 1. This essay results from cooperation between the STS (Society for Textual Scholarship) and the ESTS (European Society for Textual Scholarship) to explore the stimulating exchange of ideas between various editorial traditions. a work and how to edit it. We will discuss each orientation in section 2, below, to show how it affects what scholars understand to be the nature of texts. In addition to shaping the way a work is identified and understood, orientations guide what we do with textual materials: differentiating ways to edit, and determining how the narrative of composition, revision, and publication is framed. An orientation to text, in addition, determines what constitutes relevant materials to consider when tracing the progression of textual changes from source texts through drafts and revisions of scenes or sentences to produce scholarly accounts other than editions, such as genetic studies or arguments to support critical interpretations. A brief summary highlights the most significant differences among orientations. (1) The material orientation tends to focus on extant documentary material evidence asking how to represent it in an orderly fashion. It has two subsets: lexical and bibliographic. The purpose is primarily archival. (2) The causal orientation focuses on the agents responsible for the condition in which we find the evidence and on their authority to effect textual change. It divides into two subsets: authorial and social. (3) The temporal orientation focuses on when the text came into being, asking if there are aspects of the text that do not fit the period of its creation. It also divides into two subsets, whose purpose is either to establish synchronic snapshots of stages of textual completion or to trace the process of textual development diachronically. (4) The genetic orientation focuses on how textual invention happens as a creative process, including the effect of non-linguistic influences and byproducts of writing. (5) The performance orientation searches through and beyond documents to determine the staging of plays, the performance of musical works, and public or even private readings. (6) The aesthetic/commercial orientation tends to ask how the text can be improved to fulfill the wishes of an author, or a corporate aim at a historical moment, or to achieve current commercial or otherwise public purposes. It may seem odd that we do not include a "linguistic orientation," but we think that language is constitutive for all orientations rather than an element that can be separated from other orientations. Even if one turns to A. E. Housman's "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism," or to the most discussed aspects of George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson's editing of Piers Plowman 2 where knowledge of grammar and prosody substitute for knowledge about the author's personal habits or capacities, we find that linguistic elements turn out to be aspects of other orientations—constrained by material documents, and a sense of time and place, and/or of the personal agents of textual change. Textual scholars reviewing this list of orientations will likely say, "We are interested in all of them." But we see a distinction between interests and orientations. What, for example, does the following hypothetical scenario tell us about the editor's concept of the work? Imagine an editor facing a work that survives 2. Housman in Proceedings of the Classical Association 18 (1922): 67–84; rpt. in Selected Prose, ed. John Carter (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1961): 131–150; and William Langland , Piers Plowman: The B Version, ed. George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson ( London : Athlone , 1975). in four authoritative forms: a manuscript, a set of corrected proofs for the first edition, the first edition, and a revised edition. Many works in the modern era are more complicated than that, but this suffices to reveal what may be a problem. Say that the editor chooses as copy-text a printed form, the first edition, justifying the choice on the grounds that a social contract called for the author to "submit" (i.e., surrender) his work to a production process, and explaining that though the work was later revised, the new edition is designed to represent an early moment in the historical development of the work. But then the editor finds that an error in the manuscript was repeated in both the proofs and the first edition, but was corrected in the revised edition; the editor emends it on the grounds that the work could not have been intended to have an error, even though this one persisted in the first three forms of the work; the editor thus "furthers" the acts of socializing the text by accepting the revised (post-copy-text) edition reading. The editor then finds that the manuscript has a reading (an okay reading), but the compositors changed it in the proofs to something better (in the editor's opinion); the author, however, stubbornly marked the proofs to restore the manuscript reading; the editor reasons that the socializing process takes precedent over the authorial view because the editor likes the compositor's reading better or because of a sense of duty to follow the copy-text. However, the editor then notes that in the process of normalizing the punctuation, the compositor has run roughshod over some delicate rhetorical pointing, changing both the cadences of the prose and the meaning of the sentences; the editor decides to restore the manuscript here and there on the grounds that the socializing process occasionally did the authorial text a disservice. Finally, the editor decides that a few arcane or archaic forms of words, spellings, or punctuation would confuse readers, and so these archaic forms are slightly updated and regularized. This hypothetical editor had a variety of interests in the work; and by listing the emendations and providing a history of variant texts, the editor enables other persons to see the text differently. But, is it okay to shift the grounds for emendation as one or another of the editor's interests arises? Although the hypothetical editor in this imagined scene is an eclectic editor, the notion of "orientation drift" can also mar the clarity of thought that anyone brings to the texts that represent a work. Even when editors reject eclecticism, their reasons for doing so can shift from one orientation to another and thus cloud the reasoning that justifies their own choices. We think that the concept of orientations and their subsets provides an ordering of interests so that a consistent approach can be taken to textual investigations. An orientation does not eliminate interests, but it does provide a consistent perspective from which to organize and explore one's interests. Its usefulness lies not in isolating and approving one approach over another, but in clarifying the elements that go into decisions about the text. In the following section, we treat the second, causal, orientation at greater length in part because of recent decades of dispute about the role of persons and intentions in editing and in part because we wish to argue for the close connection that we see between traditionally disparate "authorial" and "social" editorial agendas. We also treat the fourth, genetic, at greater length, because it is a new orientation. The relative proportions of the six discussions do not represent any preference or value judgment. Orientations 1. Material Orientation The attraction of the material orientation derives primarily from the fact that documents, regardless of one's orientation, are the "bottom line" or primary evidence for works. Efforts to "get behind the evidence" or to "sort out priorities among documents" involve critical analysis, inference, and argument, which introduce dispute and opinion. Since all documents are manufactured objects, subject to the human foibles of creation and production, any new document would, by that logic alone, take its place along with already extant documents as a document with a potentially variant text. If the new document's text is somehow inferior (or superior) to the historically extant documents, then mere documentary existence is not the only essential element for scholars who use the material argument. It is something else, such as recognition of the importance of one or more of the other textual elements, or some concept of authority that asks of the new document, "By what authority do you claim to be primary evidence?" This question must then be asked of each document including drafts and manuscripts. Or differences in the value of one document over another could be related to temporal priority. Or value might arise from the particular agents who created the more valuable document. For most documentary editors there is something beyond its status as document that raises the value or authority of the text in an historical document above that of a new text created with the tools of modern scholarship. The material orientation is usefully divided into two subsets: (a) lexical and (b) bibliographic. Both are depersonalized approaches to the document. Neither asks, "Who did this?" But, interestingly, only the lexical subset allows, logically, for editorial work. (a) The lexical approach distinguishes between the document and the text far enough to allow the text to be replicated but, usually, not emended because the "lexical text in the document" is the ultimate textual evidence. 3 We call it lexical because what usually indicates to an editor that there is a flaw to be pointed out or corrected is its violation of lexical conventions. But authors who are known to have deliberately violated those conventions (famously Joyce , for example) pose serious difficulties for determining what is an error. The lexical text as found in a document is a historical fact—replicable, but only minimally emendable under this view. (b) The bibliographic approach 4 includes both the visual or iconic aspects of documents (which can be reproduced photographically) and the tactile or physical 3. Some, notably among historical-critical editors, do emend "demonstrable errors," though in doing so, they must invoke a non-materialist evaluation. 4. The bibliographic approach, based primarily on Jerome McGann's commentary on the distinctions between lexical and bibliographic code, considers the design of the book (page layout, fonts, deployment of white space) and characteristics of the material object to be part of what is meant by "the work in this form." See Jerome J. McGann , The Textual Condition (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991); and "Theories of the Text," London Review of Books (18 Feb. 1988): 20–21. McGann provides ample description of the types of meaning that the bibliographic grafts onto the lexical text. However, the logic of this view of the work dictates that any attempt to edit or replicate the work would have to adopt a new bibliographic code with new implications and would, thereby, forfeit any editorial claim to have replicated the original. We do not call it a bibliographic "code" because that suggests a semantics that can be codified. See Paul Eggert's argument about this in "Text as Algorithm and Process," Text and Genre in Reconstruction: Effects of Digitalization on Ideas, Behaviours, Products and Institutions, ed. Willard McCarty (Cambridge: Open Book, 2010): 183–202, esp. 189–191. structure (which can be photographed but not reproduced). 5 The bibliographic approach logically allows neither replication nor emendation. Both lexical and bibliographic are documentary in that they consider the physical document to be the basic unit of textual evidence, but where the lexical focuses on the text, the bibliographic focuses on the material object. Replication of any material aspect of a work in a new edition would entail new invention and, hence, failure to reproduce an essential aspect of the original object. For the bibliographic approach, facsimiles can produce similar effects and give some notion of the effects created by the original, but any emendation distorts the physical, historical record. 2. Causal Orientation The idea of an authorial orientation became a particularly controversial editorial approach in the 1980s. By renaming it the causal orientation we wish to focus attention on the personal involvement of all agents of textual change. Unlike the material or temporal, the causal orientation focuses attention on the author and on other persons involved in the writing, revising, and production of texts. In determining who "did the text" and by what authority the text was created or changed, the documents are treated as merely the surviving evidence and the "moment in time" as a mere concept about a finished product's "moment of completion"—both used to help address the question of textual integrity. Literary works are intentional creations, using the medium of writing in attempts to achieve desired goals. The causal orientation's focus on human action usually acknowledges human fallibility and often seeks ways to identify and mitigate the results of fallibility. However, this orientation also has a rich tradition of facing the pitfalls awaiting those who try to identify and emend lapses in "intentions." And yet, no one disputes that authors and others have or had intentions. Nor does anyone dispute that intentions have physical and lexical consequences in the inscription or transmission of texts. The problem is that the evidence pointing to intention is almost always problematic because speculation about it is difficult and often impossible to verify beyond dispute. One way to avoid the appearance of attempting the impossible is to shift the emphasis from intentions to effects. Asking "what difference is made by the change?" seems more accessible and may initially seem superior to asking "what 5. Torben Jelsbak , at the 7th conference of the European Society for Textual Scholarship (November 2010) in Pisa , Italy , suggested that the tactile aspect of documents be called their "plastic code," emphasizing the fact that unconventionality in physical makeup (foldouts, flipovers, and popups, for example) calls special attention to the book as book (or as contraption or fetish or art object). was the intention of the person(s) who made the change?" This shift in emphasis postpones or avoids the question, "whose intentions are being considered—whether the author's, the publisher's, or the reader's and editor's?" The shift also goes well with a second way to avoid the pursuit of intention, which is to say that the work we are really interested in is the product of a social collaboration and so we do not need to distinguish editorially between flawed and intended texts. The important issue is that a social complex was involved. On the other hand, "effects of the change" is also ambiguous. If effect refers to how a reader is affected by the change, then the same problem attends assessments of the effects of textual changes as that which troubles the pursuit of intentions, for though a scholar can vouch for the effects a change has on himself or herself, it is difficult to verify that these effects were perceived or felt by other readers. For our purposes, "intention" is restricted to the intention to make a textual change, and "effect" is taken to mean the resulting textual changes—both evidenced by marks on a document and variants in inscriptions. Editors do provide narrative explanations for the effected change, and readers can dispute those explanations. It is important that textual critics restrict their speculation about intentions to the interpretation of ambiguous or illegible or highly improbable inscriptions. For the textual critic, it is a question about what the author intended the text to be—what mark was intended to be inscribed. It is not about what the author intended the text to mean or how the author intended the text to succeed—though, of course, it is impossible to separate completely the questions of what the text is from what the text means. Textual critics agree with literary critics that intentions to mean or intentions to affect are both beyond our ability to recover indisputably; and, even if we could recover them, they would not restrict our own exercise of critical judgment about the success of such intentions. The causal orientation divides into two subsets for understanding and using textual material: (a) the authorial and (b) the social. Both the individual authorial and the social subsets see the text as a deliberately (or inadvertently) agented work which requires that students and editors address the work, not primarily as documentary or historical, but as a record of human actions. We think of the causal orientation as consisting of a continuum between an authorial approach and a social approach. At any given time and in any given document we might find the work of more than one agent of textual change, with unequal authority or skill to make changes. Should we value the work of one agent over that of others, or should we value all agents equally? It is the authorial end of the scale that is the most difficult and controversial. The social approach tends to accept the work of all who are involved in the production of each form of the work as if the work were a collaborative social and cultural endeavor among equals, whereas the authorial approach seeks to attribute the text to one or more agents whose work must be distinguished and assessed separately—agents of varying skills and authority who participated in creating and changing the text(s). Agents of textual change can fail in palpable ways in their attempts to record the text of the work as the text of a document. The text as achieved by one agent of change (say the author) may differ from the text as revised or as rendered by other agents of change (such as secretaries, editors, and compositors) each of whom was fallible (including the author) in ways that can sometimes be detected. The causal orientation asks us to choose whether to focus on the text created by and/or desired by the author or on a text created or desired in concert with one or other or all of the production personnel. Further it asks us to decide whether to focus on the text actually achieved or, if there is sufficient evidence, to discover texts attempted but not actually achieved. In judging or assessing the variant texts, it would seem legitimate and perhaps even necessary to judge the competence and authority of each agent of change. Are all the compositors at work on a Shakespeare text equally competent—whether apprentice, journeyman, or master typesetters? Is the publisher's editor as good as or a better judge of grammar, spelling, or public tolerance for edgy language than the author? Does the censor have the same kind of authority over the text as has the author? Can the scholarly editor restore the authorial reading when either or both the publisher and the censor have overruled the author? (a) An authorial approach would tend to favor the work of the author over that of production personnel, but there is no reason that the author's competence should not be questioned as well as that of other agents of textual change. (b) The social point of view, like the authorial, focuses attention on the agents of change because this view holds that literature is a socialized object. Textual agency consists of many people working in concert to make and distribute a final product. It can be argued, however, that it is not just an increase in the number of people allowed to be agents of change, but rather that the social approach entails a radically different notion of textual authority, one that exists under an agreed contract entered into, usually but not always formally, by the author and a representative of the production process—the publisher. In place of the authority of creation or authorship or of intellectual property, it is the social contract that exerts its authority over the text. Furthermore, it can be argued that this point of view respects institutions and guilds or traditions as constitutive elements in the production of literary works. As is being increasingly demonstrated by book historians, the industries that contribute the materials and skills, the laws that influence industrial practices through taxation and regulation, the laws of censorship, the customs of decency and permissiveness, and technological developments, to name a few, all have an influence on what writers write, what publishers publish, and what readers read. It follows that a social view of the literary work must deal with the actual products of these influences in order to engage with and understand the social dynamics that influenced a work. In accepting the social product as the object of choice, the social approach ends up with the same "textual condition" shared by the bibliographic view: texts that cannot be edited without obscuring or contaminating the social elements of the historical object. A new edition is, of necessity, the product of a new social dynamic, not a replication of the one claimed by the social "editor" to be the object of interest. The logic of the social orientation, like that of the bibliographic, requires one to deal directly with original materials, and yet much of this type of criticism is based on derived editions and facsimiles—to the detriment of the scholarship. 6 Furthermore, if all the agents of change are treated as 6. The primary work on the "sociology of texts" is D. F. McKenzie's Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts ( Panizzi Lectures, 1985, London : British Library, 1986). The extrapolation of a sociology of texts into a social contract or social theory of editing is J. J. McGann's in various articles and The Textual Condition. Critiques of the social approach are found in G. Thomas Tanselle , "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," Studies in Bibliography, 44 (1991): 83–143; and Shillingsburg, "Social Contracts, Production Contracts, and Authority," chapter 5 of Resisting Texts ( Ann Arbor : U Michigan P, 1997): 121–149. In "The Semiotics of Bibliography" (Textual Cultures 6.1 [2011]: 11–25), Shillingsburg argues that the social theory of editing was not part of McKenzie's views. equal authorities over the text, such that the work is seen as "co-authored" by all of its agents of change, much of the power of this point of view is vitiated. The result of the authorial approach, on the other hand, is more often than not an eclectic edition. A strict adherence to the dictates of either the social approach (one blanket rule covers the actions of all agents of change and we accept the results as a fact of history), on one hand, or the authorial orientation (excluding the actions of all agents of change save those whose ministrations served the author's intentions), on the other hand, might lead to unsatisfactory distortions of the craft of textual criticism. Understanding what the artist has achieved and how that achievement failed or succeeded in the production process requires that we pay attention and respect to both aspects of the causal orientation. Anyone who has studied the genesis of a work of art knows that authors sometimes welcome and sometimes deplore the help they get. Blanket rules and rigid applications of them would seem to undermine the potential achievements of textual criticism. It could be that the best compromise, particularly in a print edition, is for the text to be edited to reflect the work of art, as an artist's work, accepting the intervention of others only when it supports the artist's conception, rejecting it when it subverts that conception; and to then construct critical, historical, and textual supplements to account for the economic, political, and industrial complex of production, showing the history of that art in the marketplace. This is a compromise well in keeping with Anglo-American editorial traditions, where the object of editorial work has always been the production of a well-edited text and provision of an apparatus that supports and explains the editorial approaches taken to develop the newly edited text. 7 But it is a compromise not likely to be acceptable to the historical-critical editorial practice often associated with German traditions. The reason is understandable. The compromise between the social and authorial subsets of the causal orientation presupposes that an editor is to adjudicate among the archival textual elements that vie for the reader's attention in order to produce a clear reading text (a new, never-before extant text), with an apparatus that helps the reader see the work as the editor saw it. By contrast, in the historical-critical tradition, the object of textual criticism is to bring order to the historical evidence by representing the history of the text—not by interfering in the textual evidence to somehow rectify the aberrations of history. In the historical-critical tradition it is the purpose of textual criticism to collect and give coherent arrangement to the record of historical evidence. The narrative of that history is presented both in introductions and collations. 7. This in fact is the option adopted by D. F. McKenzie for his edition of The Works of William Congreve (Oxford University Press, 2010, 3 vols.), prepared for publication by C. Ferdinand . Information about the sources of changes should be given where possible, but adjudication among competing authorities about what the text "should be" is not admitted by historical-critical editors as part of the textual critic's remit. In fact, the historical-critical approach follows the material orientation, not the causal. By contrast with the Anglo-American tradition, the historical-critical edition has devoted its efforts to creating a comprehensive, coherent textual apparatus which is attached to a historical (lexical) text accurately presented. These are precisely the differences between the material and causal orientations. 3. Temporal Orientation The temporal point of view abandons "documentary integrity" as the prime or essential element of text, opening a space between "document" and "temporal stage of development" for the idea that the "text of the work" and the "text of the document" might not be the same at any particular moment in the development of the work; the document can thus mis-represent the moment of its inscription. The temporal approach is often less interested in the agent of change than in the cultural moment or stage of development. In the case of classical and medieval works, where the surviving evidence often post-dates composition of the work by decades or centuries, the concepts of "period of origination" or "period of inscription" enters more plausibly than "moment in time"—editors are often keenly aware of anachronisms in scribal copies. And yet for works surviving in an array of authorial or authorized versions a sense of the moment in time could give way to ideas about duration through time, where instead of asking why a change was introduced one could focus on the question why some text was replicated without change? For works represented by compositional and revision materials, the temporal view might locate the work in a developmental path from inception to final or last form of the work either (a) as a series of production endpoints or (b) as a continuous scale of genetic development. (a) The productive approach sees the work as a series of static or snapshot efforts to capture the work to be studied synchronically at specified moments in time, usually as fixed, more or less well, in some document. (b) A diachronic alternative sees the work as a creative development through time always progressively approaching (not necessarily reaching) a final endgame so that stages along the way are just provisional. Since for both of these views the "moment in time" or "sequence of development"—not the document itself—is the central issue, it follows that the record of that temporality, as captured in the document, is potentially faulty and therefore liable to correction or emendation. Here Pietro Beltrami's notion of the "witness text" enters to suggest that for any given time, the nearest document might be flawed. 8 Here, too, Tanselle's distinction between the text of the work and the text of the document performs the same 8. Pietro Beltrami distinguished three orientations: the manuscript orientation, the witness orientation, and the text orientation. He explained that an editor can adhere to the manuscript text, or can fix attention on the moment that is witnessed by a document, or the editor might fix upon some other notion of the work and search through all the surviving texts for evidence of what that "text orientation" would produce eclectically ("Textual Criticism and Historical Dictionaries," Presentation at the ESTS convention in Florence , Italy , Nov. 2010). office. 9 The temporal orientation, like the documentary, is depersonalized—does not discriminate primarily among those persons responsible for the text. The primary question is what was the text supposed by its producers to be at some moment in time? 4. Genetic Orientation The genetic orientation offers special opportunities and problems. In Daniel Ferrer's terms, genetic criticism can be defined as the science of written invention ["la science de l'invention écrite"] 10 ; it focuses on "invention" rather than on "repetition." 11 Keeping in mind that an orientation organizes what we understand about the factors that produced the documents and guides what we do with textual materials, the special focus that serves this organizing purpose in the genetic orientation is creative invention. Genetic criticism is applied to various art forms, including film, music, architecture, visual arts, as well as to the creative act in science. When applied to literature, the raw material with which the artist works to creatively invent a fictional world is language. However, the composition process is not exclusively linguistic in nature. Drawings of characters, sketches of the setting, schematic representations of the plot, doodles, etc. are important pre- or metalinguistic elements in the process of creation. Still, any literary project entails linguistic composition in some form or another. The genetic orientation has a natural affinity with the documentary and temporal orientations, for it focuses its attention on the documents as sources of evidence of textual development and change through time. It also has an affinity with the causal orientation for its purposes require assessment of changes in accord with the individual agents of change. In particular there is a link with the social approach, for the writer may ask a friend, a wife or husband to copy the manuscript; a publisher's editor prepares the manuscript for typesetting; the compositor may misread the manuscript and cause the author to revise the misreading to something new; a censor may delete a passage; the genesis of a work may continue after the first publication and often involves more than one agent. From the viewpoint of the social subset of the causal orientation, for which authority resides in the institutional unit of author and publisher, this multiple agency is an aspect of the past that needs to be secured; from the genetic viewpoint, the discrete acts of invention by discrete individuals must be unpacked for study. So, in spite of the affinities, there is a difference in focus, also with reference to the material and temporal orientations. Whereas for a material orientation, authority resides in the historical document and for a temporal orientation it resides in periods of inscription or re-inscription, the genetic orientation's focus is on the actions of invention as implied by the chronological succession of documents and the transformations within and between them. 9. See G. Thomas Tanselle , A Rationale of Textual Criticism ( Philadelphia : Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1989). 10.

Daniel Ferrer , "Critique génétique et philologie: racine de la différence," Genesis 30 (2010): 21–23 (21). A genetic edition, according to French genetic critics such as Almuth Grésillon , 12 contains the complete facsimile reproduction of the documents pertaining to the genesis of a work. There is, however, a variant form which is referred to as an "édition critico-génétique," rather than an "édition génétique." This type of edition tends to present the transcriptions of the manuscripts at the service of a critically edited text ne varietur. The link with this edited text bothers committed genetic critics. After all, one of the merits of genetic criticism is its suggestion that the study of modern manuscripts does not need to be reduced to a subservient role at the service of the establishment of an edited text ne varietur. Whereas, in scholarly editing, manuscript analysis is often seen as a means to an end, that is, a tool to make an edition, genetic criticism reverses these roles and sees the making of an edition as a tool to facilitate manuscript analysis. The publishing market's demand for a single reading text is hard to reconcile with a theory of the fluid 13 or mutable text, but such a reconciliation is not impossible, as for instance John Bryant and Haskell Springer have shown by interrupting the reading text with 'revision narratives' in their edition of Melville's Moby Dick ). 14 Even though many genetic critics tend to insist on the difference between textual criticism and critique génétique, it is possible to establish a rapprochement because the definition of orientations to text is not necessarily geared towards the production of an edited text, but conceived as a way of identifying how we read the materials in order to understand the work. A genetic orientation focuses on the trajectory or trajectories of creative development, including sources of inspiration. It does not have to, but may involve a form of scholarly editing. If it does, it implies an editorial strategy that displays creativity in motion rather than settling on a final version as the main object of editing. It aims to produce a narrative of genetic development. And unlike many scholarly editions, the genetic orientation includes source texts and their transformation into the work as a part of the process of invention. It comprises all the stages and facets of a work's genesis, for which Raymonde Debray Genette 15 coined the terms "exogenesis" and "endogenesis," and to which a third category could be added: "epigenesis." 16 These concepts will be discussed in the following paragraphs. (a) Exogenesis. The work's genesis often starts in the margins of other authors' books. This link with external sources of information is referred to as "exogenesis." The stereotypical river metaphor, suggesting that a text developed from a single source, or went through a sequential and orderly set of changes to reach 12.

To facilitate manuscript research, a genetic edition could offer an author's personal library, where it is still extant. It is evident that this type of edition benefits hugely from new possibilities created by digital media. Since the limitations of print demanded that (long) works be represented by only one text at a time, the establishment of a single reading text was presupposed in the original definition of orientations to texts (although notable exceptions were taken into account, such as Wordsworth's two Preludes or Shakespeare's King Lears ). Since "the business of editing" was seen by many editors of print editions as "the elimination of error and the selection of the authoritative readings for the new text, which supersede all other authoritative alternatives," 17 a selection needed to be made by attributing authority, located variously according to the editor's critical orientation. This selection can still be very useful, but in the meantime, electronic forms of presentation have eased the limitations so that it is possible to present several edited texts alongside each other, and combine them with digital facsimiles and transcriptions of all the paralipomena, notes and drafts preceding the first publication, including marginalia and reading notes. (b) Endogenesis. The genetic orientation's special fascination is with documents that bear the evidence of multiple efforts, often by more than one agent, over extended periods of time. It is less absorbed in the documentary aspect than in what can be extracted from it about the sequence of discoveries, inventions, and actions of the writer(s). Again, the digital medium offers new possibilities to produce a display of textual history for a work that will help focus attention on the acts of writing—the acts of invention—so that they can be studied. This genetic textual instrument does not substitute for other kinds of editions but serves as a tool for studying the work in the genetic critical way. At the level of the endogenesis, a rapprochement between scholarly editing and genetic criticism can be mutually beneficial. From an editorial perspective, the focus on invention underlies the rationale of a genetic edition, designed to show process but taking product into account as an often crucial element in the dynamics that drive the process of invention. Even if a particular writing project was eventually not finished, the author usually did need a projected end to write toward, in order to start and continue writing in the first place. The difference of merely one letter between "invention" and "intention" is deceptively small. 18 Writing a text generally implies an intention, but the study of manuscripts usually reveals a plurality of intentions. Similarly, the notion of invention often implies a succession of inventions. But the main difference 17. Peter Shillingsburg , Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age: Theory and Practice (Duntroon: English Department, UNSW, 1984; 2nd ed. Athens : Univ. of Georgia Press, 1986; 3rd ed. Ann Arbor : Univ. of Michigan Press, 1996): 13–14. 18. In the context of textual genesis, they are both related to the notion of a creative agent. This creative agent regains center stage in Louis Hay's book La Littérature des écrivains, whose main premise is that literary critics have generally put more emphasis on reception during the last few decades, but that literature is a matter, not only of readers, but also of writers. Louis Hay , La Littérature des écrivains ( Paris : José Corti , 2002). is that the notion of invention is directly related to the traces of this creative act on the extant manuscripts, whereas the link between an intention and the materialized result is somewhat less direct and it is notoriously hard to figure out if or to what extent this result corresponds with an intention. The documents, warts and all, bear witness to the efforts of an agent of change (usually the writer), in the first place, as a reader of him- or herself and as an active participant in a process of rewriting. Interpreting this process of invention constitutes the "critical" component of critique génétique. The "genetic" component focuses on the genetic dossier, which can now be conveniently presented in a digital environment, as the recent addition to the Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) guidelines for genetic editions testifies. From a genetic perspective, a shift of emphasis from motives to effects also involves an attempt to regard variants not necessarily as textual elements that necessitate emendation or purging, but to understand them as elements of inventive development. For that reason, French genetic critics often prefer to speak of "rewritings" (réécritures), instead of variants. 19 The argument is that one can only speak of "variants" if there is an "invariant" against which they can be compared. Some authors' writing methods, such as Marcel Proust's , proceed in relatively large textual units that were shuffled around and for which a hypertextual electronic architecture might be a suitable form of presentation. In such cases, it is indeed difficult to work with the notion of a variant. Other writing methods, however, do show patterns of relative stability in terms of the text's structure. In these cases, one does not need to insist on a rejection of the term "variants." Some works' genetic dossiers do consist of versions that can be compared, not merely in general terms, but even at the level of small textual units such as a segment or sentence. In such a case, it is possible to speak of compositional variants, since every version can serve as a temporary invariant for comparison against the subsequent version. Such a relative calibration can be applied in an electronic genetic edition by identifying segments that correspond between different versions, allowing the user to compare a segment in one version to the same segment in another version or in all the other versions simultaneously (synoptically). In such a synoptic survey of all the extant versions of a small textual unit (for instance a sentence), the syntactical context of each segment can remain intact, which results in a form of "versioning" that allows for detailed comparison of stages in the writing process. Depending on the author's writing method, for instance in the case of Samuel Beckett's late writings (www.beckettarchive.org), it is possible to allow for a form of digitally supported collation 20 by highlighting the variants between versions. If a manuscript or typescript shows clear signs of different writing tools or different handwritings, a version can be subdivided into several stages, which would allow for an even more refined collation of compositional variants or réécritures. (c) Epigenesis. The genesis often continues after publication. About changes made by the author after publication, Pierre-Marc de Biasi once noted: "How-ever 19. Pierre-Marc de Biasi , La Génétique des textes ( Paris : Nathan , 2000): 20. 20. Dirk Van Hulle , The Making of Samuel Beckett's Stirrings Still / Soubresauts and Comment dire / what is the word ( Brussels : University Press Antwerp , 2011): 117. ever important, these modifications (or "variants") [...] do not have exactly the same status as the transformations to be observed in the genetic documents" because "the mutations of the avant-texte took place in a private writing domain," whereas "postpublication modifications are made in a public sphere where the book's reality cannot be ignored." 21 In broad outlines, such a division between an individual authorial creative trajectory and a social production trajectory may be useful, but often the transition from "private" to "public" sphere is marked by a continuum rather than a clear boundary. Before publication, an author may "try out" a particular chapter by reading it to a circle of friends; or the political climate may be so dangerous that it enters the private sphere in the sense that it may lead to self-censorship during the composition process, to the extent that certain creative ideas do not even reach the stage of the roughest draft. In 1972, while genetic criticism was only just establishing itself in France as a discipline in its own right, James Thorpe already drew attention to "the status of multiple versions of a work of art," referring to important examples, such as Valéry's urge to keep modifying his texts and Yeats' "drive to revise." 22 Four years later, Thomas Tanselle suggested that "two types of revision must be distinguished: that which aims at altering the purpose, direction, or character of a work, thus attempting to make a different sort of work out of it; and that which aims at intensifying, refining, or improving the work as then conceived (whether or not it succeeds in doing so), thus altering the work in degree but not in kind." 23 The first type was called "vertical revision," the second "horizontal." In some cases, it may be hard to decide whether a modification alters or intensifies the work, i.e., to make a distinction between "vertical" and "horizontal" revisions, but what is important to note in the context of textual orientations is that this distinction does not coincide with the distinction between endo- and epigenetics. The latter distinction corresponds more to the example of Tennyson , which Jerome McGann refers to in A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism: "This was a poet who frequently revised his work on the basis of the responses he received from a small circle of friends (at the trial proof stage) as well as from reviewers and the larger audience (at the publication stage)." 24 The first type of revisions is endogenetic, the second type is epigenetic; in both cases the modifications by Tennyson were inspired through confrontation with an audience. In his typology of genetic documentation, Pierre-Marc de Biasi ("What Is a Literary Draft") gives due prominence to the moment the author decides the text is ready to be printed and presented to the public ( bon à tirer ). By the time of the bon à tirer moment, however, the initial target may have shifted during the process of writing, and once the target is reached, the process of writing is 21.

McGann , A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism ( Chicago and London : Univ. of Chicago Press, 1983): 48. not necessarily finished. If the author is a self-translator, for instance, the work becomes a "source text" that is translated into a new target, which in translation studies is referred to as a "target text." In the case of playwrights who direct their own plays, their practice as directors may lead to additions or cuts during rehearsals. Almuth Grésillon drew attention to the special treatment of "genèses théâtrales" 25 and she wrote a foundational article with Jean-Marie Thomasseau in a special issue of the journal Genesis devoted to the topic. 26 Thomasseau, who focuses on non-contemporary theatre, duly points out that "non-contemporary theatrical genetics discards the idea of a single author by focusing as much on the process of transforming a play, and on those who perform it, as on the author who wrote it. It begins with the recognition that in the theatrical process the authorial role necessarily fractures and becomes shared." 27 The genetic study of theatrical performances involves different kinds of documents, such as visual and aural recordings of rehearsals, director's notes, lighting designs, prompt books, actors' notes, set designs, sketches, scale-models, stage managers' notebooks. These traces may be of help in analysing the dynamics both of the theatrical performance and of the dramatic text. The epigenetic changes require an adequate editorial approach that treats variants as réécritures. For although scholarly editors may frown at de Biasi's observations on the term "variants," the term réécritures does invite them to look at variants, not only in terms of emendation, but also as elements of inventive development. On the other hand, genetic critics should also realize that, to some extent, the rejection of the term "variants" was part of the discourse of the early days of genetic criticism, when it strongly felt the need to distinguish itself from textual criticism. In the meantime, genetic criticism has clearly established itself as a discipline and we have arrived at a point of mutual, interdisciplinary respect for, and openness to, each other's different priorities, techniques, and approaches. 5. Performance Orientation It is fairly easy to see that plays and music and also dance notation and architectural plans are less than complete until they have been transformed or "interpreted" as performances or transferred from their notational (textual) conceptions into their fulfillments in events or buildings or landscapes. Thus, if the endgame of the work is seen as a performance or as the construction of something for which the text is a set of instructions, a recipe, or a score, it is likely that the drafts, fragments, plans, and printed texts for the work will be looked 25. Almuth Grésillon, "Genèses théâtrales," La mise en oeuvre: Itinéraires génétiques ( Paris : CNRS Editions, 2008): 245–267. A more extensive treatment of the topic, with various contributions, can be found in the edited volume: Almuth Grésillon, Marie-Madeleine Mervant- Roux and Dominique Budor, eds., Genèses théâtrales ( Paris : CNRS Editions, 2010). 26.

Jean-Marie Thomasseau, "Towards a Genetic Understanding of Non-contemporary Theatre: Traces, Objects, Methods," Theatre Research International 33.3 (2008): 234–249; esp. 236. at in a radically different way from that which is adopted when a reader sees in a text a means of experiencing the work by merely reading it. The line between these two modes of textual function is not always very clear, however, because a poem might be seen as something to be read aloud, making it more like a song than a physical or symbolic object to be contemplated for itself. But beyond that, it seems plausible also to speak of a novel as an "object" that can only be experienced through the performing act of reading, even though silently to one's self. The point, however, of these observations is that a performative orientation toward the textual materials for a work might focus attention on their value in helping us to imagine how the work has been performed in the past or in helping us to imagine how the work could or should be performed now. The key word in performance is "enactment." 28 What distinguishes the performance orientation from others is its focus on how a work's instructions for performance are carried out. For texts that are "merely read," performative acts are individual and vary from one reader to another depending on skill and reading style. Editors can have little to do with that kind of performance, though historians of reading find an endless fascination in tracing evidence of reading habits. In this vein, reviews of works can be seen as reports on reading performances, but again editors may be justified in ignoring this kind of evidence when considering what it is that constitutes works to be read. However, that is not the case with plays, orations, public poetry, music, or dance, because in each of these cases each performance of the work constitutes a crucial ontological form of the work. Because performances in these genres were unrecorded before the invention of recording devices, our only access to performed works of earlier periods is reports and reviews of their enactments and internal evidence. According to researchers such as Jean-Marie Thomasseau, traditional history of the theatre often reduced the theatrical to the literary. Instead, he proposes to think differently of "the theatre as an object within historical determinants, without reducing it to a mere analysis of the different manuscript states of the text leading to the edition." 29 While Thomasseau's suggestions deal with "non-contemporary" theatre, contemporary trends such as post-dramatic theater 30 pose yet another set of challenges to editing. As Almuth Grésillon notes, the emphasis on performance 28. Ronald Broude , in "Musical Works, Musical Texts, and Musical Editions" (Scholarly Editing 33 [2012], on-line journal; http://www.scholarlyediting.org/2012/essays/essay.broude.html), distinguishes "historicizing" editions from "enabling" editions; and in "Performance and the Socialized Text" (Textual Cultures 6 [2011]: 23–47), Broude writes of such texts as socialized, but the emphasis is on performance editions.

Such documents can be edited from the material, temporal, causal, or genetic orientations, but when edited from a performance orientation, significant attention will be devoted to the "work" that is being indicated beyond the material text—that which is the "end product" intended or envisioned by the work's creator(s). It would require a dexterous argument to defend restoring to a performance text an aspect of the work that had been judged unperformable, even if that judgment were made by some "unauthorized" but experienced performer rather than the author. It is a further aspect of the performance orientation that a far keener interest attends the history of performance through extended periods including the present than attends the posthumous repackaging of reading texts for commercial sale. Book historians are, of course, interested in the history of a work's repackaging, but editors will frequently ignore editions produced after the death of the author unless new authorial materials were involved or unless they are particularly interested in adaptations. In editing performance texts, on the other hand, it is easier to justify the effort to create histories of variant performances as part of the scholarly edition. 6. Aesthetic/Commercial Orientation Although, as noted above, the aesthetic approach is seldom countenanced any more in scholarly editing, it might be worth pointing out that many editors and readers are attracted to their tasks initially for aesthetic reasons, if aesthetics is defined to include pleasure and the appreciation of skill in language, narrative, or forms—which are not directly related to utility or exposition. Consequently, we believe that aesthetics is relevant to the task of editing, but we acknowledge that it is a difficult aspect upon which to reach consensus and is especially vulnerable to the charge of the eccentricities of personal taste. However, one can posit a difference between an approach to editing that seeks to respect the known aesthetic principles of an author or of a historical publisher, on one hand, and the very different approach, on the other hand, that asks simply, How can we make this old-fashioned work better so that it can have renewed commercial life? The former has a historical dimension for which evidence (not the editor's personal taste) can be adduced. And finally, we believe it is worth pointing out that all the orientations, with their scholarly attention to evidence and the inferences from the evidence that are supported by argument, cannot, for all their efforts, be totally objective or free from the sense that judging amongst variants involves aesthetic principles. However, as previously noted, this subject is too complicated to pursue in this essay. 31. Almuth Grésillon, "Genèses théâtrales," 266. Conclusions As the previous sections indicate implicitly, this re-orientation to "orientations to text" was also inspired in part by possibilities recently developed for electronic editing. The flexibility of digital media removes some of the narrow bands constraining a scholar's use of orientations: combinations are now possible that before tended to confuse the work. We began with the notion that an orientation to texts helps one identify the character or nature of the work one is studying and to focus attention on various aspects of a work's inspiration, creation, production, and reception–aspects that help us understand the work as an event or series of events in history. Those understandings of the work also help to give a perspective to editorial activity. In the digital world, one is always working at one remove from the primary materials, which is a disadvantage one can too easily forget, but the advantages are great. A digital scholarly edition does not need to be organized exclusively for the purpose of establishing a single edited text produced according to the priorities of one particular orientation. Several edited texts can be presented as equal alternatives serving different goals. This implies that it is perhaps even more important for editors than it already was to be aware of the distinctive elements and priorities of different orientations. What the concept of orientations also shows is that, important as edited texts are, the object of textual study and of digital presentation does not need to be an edited text. A scholar's orientation to text can organize the facts about the work such that process rather than product is the main focus. An awareness of orientations to text can therefore be useful, not only to the individual scholarly editor who tries to be consistent in his or her approach to reading and editing, but also to editors as a community of scholars with an openness to understanding and respecting other editors' approaches and priorities. READERS' MEMORIALS IN EARLY EDITIONS OF CHAUCER by Hope Johnston CHAUCER'S early and enduring fascination among english readers has become a source of interest in itself among modern critics. The foundation for studies of Chaucer's reception is Caroline Spurgeon's classic Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, which gathers quotations concerning him from the late medieval period through the end of the nineteenth century. 1 In more recent years, book historians have turned to evidence from medieval manuscripts and early printed books. Alexandra Gillespie provides a thoughtful study of how printers crafted the idea of Chaucer as Author through their decisions about the presentation of his texts. 2 Alison Wiggins considers how readers used their early printed books by examining the annotations found in her survey of fifty-four surviving black-letter copies. 3 This essay will consider how individuals took printed books and re-crafted them in ways that reflect the high cultural status accorded to Chaucer. Intentional alterations made by book owners to their sixteenth-century editions of Chaucer include memorial inscriptions, title-page embellishments, and portraits inserted as frontispieces. Owners personally mended, emended, and augmented books, and in so doing, they memorialized Chaucer as well as his corpus of writing. Their active engagement with books as physical objects offers a new approach 1. Caroline F. E . Spurgeon, Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion 1357 –1900, 3 vols.

See below for relevant citations and further discussion concerning reader inscriptions of Chaucer's Latin epitaph in early printed books. to reception studies. While the recovery of annotations is a valuable means of discerning reader engagement with the text, examining the individuation of the artifact can tell a story, too, about readers' perception of Chaucer's fame. Memorial Inscriptions And Heraldry Seth Lerer argues that classical eulogies composed for Chaucer were meant not just to perpetuate his memory but to liberate writers from his shadow by putting him firmly in his grave. 4 This literary gesture took physical form when Nicholas Brigham commissioned a marble monument ca. 1556 commonly referred to as "Chaucer's Tomb," giving Chaucer a place in Westminster Abbey among the prelates and kings of England's past. 5 It created a public locus for Chaucer's national importance, as Thomas A . Prendergast has noted, yet the duration of memory bound up in the memorial would have been largely symbolic during the sixteenth century. 6 Variations among the versions of the Latin epitaph on Chaucer's tomb testify that the exact wording was not set in stone but took on its own life, as Joseph A . Dane shows in his study of the tomb verses. 7 Readers participated actively in the memorial process by inscribing verses from the monument in early printed copies of his writing. Rather than circumscribing Chaucer's reach by marking his death, elegiac verses continued to draw interest from readers who turned the pages of his writing over the centuries. The ideological association of tome and tomb is a topic that has interested a number of critics in recent years. Scholars have been reporting discoveries of the Westminster Abbey epitaph in twos and threes, mostly bringing these to light serendipitously while pursuing other projects. Joseph A . Dane and Alexandra Gillespie first called attention to the epitaph phenomenon with examples at the Huntington Library and the University of Texas Harry Ransom Center. 8 Alison Wiggins documents three more examples from the Cambridge University Library and the Folger Shakespeare Library, and Arnold Sanders reports two more 4.

The hands of the readers date from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, meaning that the practice was more than a contemporary response to a current event, and from a meta-perspective, recent monographs by Dane and Prendergast attest that the topic remains an active subject of interest today. The inscriptions in individual copies (see table 1) demonstrate that book owners continued to make the association between tome and tomb over an extended period of time. Table 1.

Rare Book Librarian Kyle R . Triplett has discovered lines from William Camden's Britannia in a copy of the 1561 Woorkes at the New York Public Library on the verso of a parchment title page ( figure 1 ). 10 Camden's quotation is featured more prominently than the tomb epitaph in Speght's 1598 edition, and Camden's name would carry a high recognition value for Elizabethan readers. The popularity of his Britannia can be measured by the fact that it went through six editions between 1586 and 1607. In 1610 George Bishop and John Norton printed an English translation by Philemon Holland , who translates Camden's passage on Chaucer liberally: 11 For, hee surpassing all others without question in wit, and leaving our smattering Poet-asters by many degrees behind him: iam monte potitus, Ridet anhelantem dura ad fastigia turbam. When once himselfe the steepe hill top had woone, At all the sort of them he laught anone 9.

Rare Book Division, New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, Tilden Foundations (*KC + 1561). "The learned Italian" mentioned obliquely by Camden as the author of the Latin verse is the humanist Angelo Poliziano (1454–94). Speght therefore deals out a double dose of intellectual gravitas in the quotation from Camden's Britannia, who cites an Italian humanist in turn. The annotator's decision to inscribe the Camden passage on the title page verso of Stow's 1561 Woorkes participates in a pattern of literary witnessing that goes beyond variations of the tomb verses. Indeed, the last two Latin lines quoted from Camden's Britannia are inscribed on the title page of a 1602 edition at Trinity College Dublin (R. bb. 24) that belonged to Archbishop James Ussher (1581 –1656), and it would not be surprising if future research finds Camden cited by readers in other copies. Memorial quotations in several cases occur in combination with each other. Dane and Gillespie observe that the tomb verses in the Huntington Library copy appear with an untraced Latin distich, "Chaucer occubuit sed corpore, cetera magnis | post cineres virtus vincere sola facit" [Chaucer is dead, but his spirit lives on], which they suggest might have been composed by the owner. 12 Another early owner selects lines from the writings of Tiberius, Horace, Virgil, and Cicero to accompany the Latin epitaph in a copy of the 1561 edition at Pembroke College, Cambridge ( figure 2 ): Qui fuit Angloru m decus lui Ter = Maximus olim, Gualfridus Chaucer condit u r hoc Tumulo; Annu m si quæras Dominj si tempora mortis, Ecce notæ subsunt, quæ tibj cuncta notant 12.

The substitution of "decus lui" for "vates" appears to be unique among the variants recorded by Dane. An English couplet below this, in a secretary hand, reads: "O worthy Chaucer though in toumbe thow lye | Thy famous works shall neuer dye." Other quotations follow: viuit post funera virtus vivit post funera chaucer Dignu m Laude viru m Musa vetat morj Gloria virtutem tanquam vmbra sequitur Dignu m laude viru m Musa vetat mori The muses w i th eternall memorye do hym record that liued worthelye Dum iuga montis aper, fluvios du m piscis amabit The first quotation from Tiberius, "viuit post funera virtus" [virtue lives on after the grave], appears twice, reformulated the second time as "vivit funera chaucer" and paired with a quotation from Horace's Odes: "Dignu m Laude viru m Musa vetat morj" [the muse forbids the man who is worthy of praise to die], which Thomas Speght quotes in his introduction to Chaucer's Works (1598). The English verses provide a translation: "The muses with eternall memorye | do hym record that liued worthelye," and lines from Virgil's Fifth Eclogue measure eternity: "Dum iuga montis aper, fluvios du m piscis amabit" [as long as the boar shall love the mountain height, as long as the fish the rivers]. One more contribution is carefully lettered in a distinct humanist hand, citing Cicero: "Gloria virtutem tanquam vmbra sequitur" [Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow]. While the Latin epitaph in Westminster Abbey emulates the style of classical writers, here readers concatenate phrases by classical authors interspersed with English verse for an English author, creating a common-place book of tributes in an uncommon way. Another example of multi-layered quotations appears in a copy of Thynne's 1542 edition at the British Library with three passages that all seem to be the handiwork of the antiquarian Thomas Martin (1687–1771) ( figure 3 ). 13 His note about the book's local history is consistent with his interest in Norfolk antiquities: This Title page is pasted on by the Reverend Mr. Nathaniel Coddington , rector of West Wretham in Norfolk, who was one of Mr. Anthony Wotton's executors, of Farsfield. The book formerly belonged to Dr. Samuel Wotton , rector also of West Wretham.

FIGURE 3. Title page recto and verso, Thynne's second edition (STC 5070, 1542). © British Library Board (C.57.g.6). He does not look to Nicholas Brigham for memorial verses but to a contemporary publication, John Dryden's Fables, Ancient and Modern (1700). The first quotation copied on the page is from Horace's Ars Poetica, which Dryden quotes in his introduction as a rationale for translating Chaucer's verse: "Multa renascuntur qus nunc cecidere: cadentque | Quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus | Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi" [ Many words shall revive, which now have fallen off; and many which are now in esteem shall fall off, if it be the will of custom, in whose power is the decision and right and standard of language]. 15 The inscription attests to the appeal of lines by an ancient poet, even though Chaucer's Middle English had become sufficiently foreign by the end of the seventeenth century that Dryden argues for the expediency of modernizing the text. Martin appears to appreciate Dryden's reverence for Chaucer , copying his panegyric verses in the center of the leaf, glossed with deliberate care as "Testimonia de Chaucer et scriptis ejus:" The Bard who first adorn'd our Native Tongue Tun'd to his British Lyre, this Ancient Song: Which Homer Might without a blush rehearse, And leaves a doubtful palm in Virgils verse: He Match'd their beauties where they Most Excell; Of Love Sung better, And of Arms as well. Drydens prologue to the Knights Tale Martin pens the words in a careful hand that strives toward formality, but the quotation from John Skelton's "Philip Sparrow" is in the same hand as the provenance note: In Chaucer I am sped, His Tales I have read: His matter is delectable, S[o]lacious, and commendable; His English well allowed, So as it is enprowed, For as it is employed, There is no English void At those days much commended; And now men would have amended His English, whereat they bark, And mar all they wark. Chaucer, that famous clerk, His termes were not dark, But pleasant, easy, and plain; No word he wrote in vain. Where the poem should read "solacious," Martin writes "salacious," which conveys a quite a different sentiment from solicitousness – though arguably still true. Certainly the jaunty little woodcut man pasted at the bottom of the page seems less inclined to lugubrious mourning than to reveling in Chaucer's more boisterous tales. The owner-crafted title page turns commemoration into a vivacious 15. Horace, Ars Poetica, trans. Christopher Smart (1756), repr. in American Academy of Poets, http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19921. though still respectful gesture. The lines by Skelton also offer a cheeky answer to Dryden's invocation of Horace, chiding "men who would have amended | His English, wherat they bark." Instead of cascading from one classical quotation to another, the quotations banter rather slyly. Martin's decision to bracket it in the 1542 copy between Horace's quotation and Skelton's defense seems to express a personal antiquarian preference for Chaucer's early English, while also invoking Dryden's authority as an English poet. This context is lost in a copy of Stow's 1561 edition at the Cambridge University Library, where Martin's hand can be found again on a slip of paper pasted into the book ( figure 4 ). 16 Lines of text bleed through from the other side of the slip, indicating that the owner excised the Dryden stanza in Martin's hand from another book, instead of copying the lines anew. Beneath it, the owner identifies the hand of " T. Martin " with the date 1716 in pencil, attaching value not only to Dryden's commemoration of Chaucer but to the antiquarian who copied the lines as well. FIGURE 4. Title page verso, Stow's Workes (STC 5075, 1561). Reproduced by kind permission of the Syndics of Cambridge University Library (Keynes S.7.9). In Martin's case, memorial verses in one hand appear in more than one copy, compared to multiple hands contributing lines on the same leaf in a given book. An acephalous copy of the ca. 1550 edition at the State Library of South Australia (SLSA) bears witness to two passages of English poetry in one hand with a version of Brigham's epitaph in a different hand at the bottom of the page ( figure 5 ). The English lines, while conventional in sentiment, are not immediately identifiable in the collections of Chaucer allusions catalogued by Caroline Spurgeon or more recently by Jackson Campbell Boswell and Sylvia Wallace Holton . 17 16.

Last original fly leaf recto, Thynne's third edition ( STC 5072?, ca. 1550). The State Library of South Australia (RBR 821.C496b). The passages compare Chaucer to Virgil , Ovid , and the French poet Guillaume de Saluste , seigneur du Bartas (1544–90), and extend Chaucer's fame to a residence in Woodstock , Oxfordshire that antiquarians associated with his family: In laudem Galfridi Chaucer. Thou first reformer of our Englishe tounge, That erst was barren, rude, and indigeste, Till by thy paynes it was manur'de &amp; drest, Which since hath florished &amp; sweetlie spronge. Chaucer thy learninge, witt, &amp; wisedome sage Nor hath, nor shalbe match'd by any age. Greece honour'd Homer for his goulden sayes. The Worlde Heroicke Virgill doth commend. Sweete Ovids prayses never shall haue end. Fraunce crown'd Dubartas with immortall Bayes. England thy Chaucer for his witts renowne, Deserves of brightest, starres, a glorious Crowne. In laudem Novæ Woodstocke. Natures chiefe pride, thou Nurse of famous Kinges, Earths Paradice, seate of all sweete delight Whose Wood es of chirpinge Musicke ever ringes And are w i th Feasaunt, Deere and Partridge dight yet Chaucers life to Woodstocke gave more fame Then all her Gyft es ; or Kinges of greatest name. The allusion to Guillaume de Saluste , seigneur du Bartas (1544–90) provides a context for dating the verses: Joshua Sylvester's English translation of La Semaine was printed in 1592, 1605, 1608, 1611, 1613, and 1641. 18 Spurgeon observes that writers habitually referred to Chaucer as the "first and greatest of English poets" in the first 150 years after his death, and comparisons between Chaucer and other poets "are so very common" that they go without count. 19 Chaucer's association with Woodstock remained a topic of active interest through the eighteenth century, though the family's residence in Oxfordshire (if true) dates after Chaucer's lifetime. 20 The poetry wobbles perhaps when comparing the enriching effect of Chaucer's writing to manure, though the agricultural metaphor is a familiar trope, and the claim that Woodstock derives greater fame from Chaucer than from English kings goes a little too far in its exuberant enthusiasm. The lines are in keeping with sentiments expressed in previously catalogued Chauceriana, 17. William L.

The Westminster Abbey epitaph appears in a different hand on the bottom of the same leaf: The Epitaph of Geoffry Chawcer vpon his Monument in Westminstr Abby Qui fuit Anglorum vates, ter maximus olim Galfridus Chaucer, Conditur hoc tumulo, An n um si quæras domini, si tempora mensis, Ecce notæ subsunt, quæ tibi cuncta notent. / [O]ctobris 24 1400 ·/ The last word of line three is "mortis" (death) in most versions, except those that follow Speght's reading, "vitæ" (life); here, the annotator of the SLSA copy departs from both established readings with "mensis" (month) instead. Exchanging "mortis" for "mensis" means that line three begins and ends with measures of calendar time, "annum" (year) and "mensis" (month). It might be an accidental variant introduced through eye-skip from the date which appears at the end of the epitaph. Dane's table of variants seems to support the premise that readers may have followed flawed exemplars and contributed scribal errors of their own in the process of copying the memorial verses. At least one more instance of a memorial dedication deserves note, this time in an association copy of Speght's 1602 edition that belonged to Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning ( figure 6 ). 21 She was a well-established poet before their marriage in 1846, and she participated in another attempted revival of Chaucer's English in 1841 edited by Richard Horne , The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer , Modernized. 22 Her pencil markings in the 1602 edition show how she counted out the meter of Chaucer's Anelide and Arcite while composing Queen Annelida and False Arcite , her contribution for the collection. In an essay published the following year, in 1842, she makes her esteem for Chaucer's place in literary history clear: "the metaphors of dawn and spring doubly become him. A morning star, a lark's exultation, cannot usher in a glory better." 23 Some years after her death in 1861, Robert Browning took the 1602 Chaucer with him during an annual vacation to France in 1872, while he was chiefly focused on Greek literature. 24 Browning 21.

Root of Princeton translates as, "The dawn is at hand, the dawn is breaking and this star is one of its precursors," in response to a query about the inscription in 1925. 25 With this well-chosen quotation from the ancient past Browning honors both Chaucer and his wife as he turns from the tomb to the prospect of a rising sun. Of course, this forward-looking perspective is thoroughly traditional, too: it is consistent with the convention expressed in Dryden's epitaph celebrating Chaucer as the luminous beginning of English literature. FIGURE 6. Speght's second edition ( STC 5080, 1602). Courtesy of Armstrong Browning Library, Baylor University (X BL 821.17 C496w). The examples of the NYPL 1561 edition, the Pembroke College Cambridge 1561 edition, Martin's 1542 edition, and the Brownings ' 1602 edition thus capture ways in which book owners paid homage to Chaucer with memorial inscriptions that may or may not include the Latin epitaph. They also suggest that a search of additional copies almost certainly will reveal further instances of such tributes. Commemorative efforts extend beyond copying written epitaphs into readers' books: interest in the heraldic insignia associated with Chaucer likewise appears in early printed copies. 26 Sir John Mason (ca. 1503–66) draws Chaucer's arms at the end of the Canterbury Tales in his copy of the 1532 edition ( figure 7 ). Beside the sketch, Mason notes in an italic hand that "This coat p er taineth to Gefery Chaucer Esq ire the Author of this Booke./ whoc was in Rychard the second tyme ./" He documents the colors assigned to the author: "party p er pale argent and guiles , a bend counterchanged." 27 The chivalric imagery and 25.

Other owners took notice of Chaucer's chivalric status in a copy of the 1542 edition at the Cambridge University Library, inserting " Geoffry Chaucer knight " in manuscript on the title page (Sel.2.2), and in a copy of the 1561 edition at the British Library adding "Sir" above the printed name "Geffrey" and "knyght" after it (83.l.5). language signals respect for Chaucer's social standing and historic importance. John Stow displays Chaucer's arms prominently on the Woorkes title page, and an anonymous English couplet printed beneath it expresses an elegiac sentiment similar in tone to the Latin epitaph: "Vertue florisheth in Chaucer still | Though death of hym, hath wrought his will" ( STC 5076). 28 The reader of another book, "ffran: Parry ," achieves a similar effect in a copy of the ca. 1550 edition at the John Rylands Library, transcribing the first two lines of the Westminster Abbey epitaph beneath the title page border: "Qui fuit Anglorum vates ter maximus olim | Galfridus Chaucer conditur hoc tumulo" ( figure 8 ). Whether Parry knew of Stow's 1561 design or not, the brevity of the transcription and its conscientious placement are similar visually to the Stow engraving of Chaucer's arms. FIGURE 7. Sig.

Several book owners embellished the black-and-white cut to display the red-and-white colors assigned to him. One example can be found in a copy of the 1561 Chaucer at the Harry Ransom Center with red shading for the shield and gold highlights with a yellow pencil (PR 1850 1561b, copy 2). 28. Speght's 1598 edition also features verses dedicated to Chaucer's fame at the crown of the title page border for STC 5078 and 5079 (though not STC 5077): "CHAVCER. | Out of the old fields, as men sayth, | Commeth all this new corn, fro yere to yere: | And out of old books, in good fayth, | Com m eth al this new science that men lere;" a lower compartment at the base of the border reads: "Ouid. | Seris venit vsus ab annis." FIGURE 8. Title page, Thynne's third edition. John Rylands Library, Copyright of The University of Manchester (21316). The owner of a 1598 copy also at the Harry Ransom Center uses a red wash to accent the shaded portions of the shield (PR1850 1598b, copy 2). At the York Minster Library, hand-tinted fragments of the Speed portrait have been preserved (XIVI.9). A copy of the 1602 edition in Trinity College, Cambridge is illuminated in opaque tints, with the unicorn's horn and mane in yellow; red for shaded portions of the drawing, and blue for the helmet and the couplet border (Munby A.2). The shield is also decorated by hand in another copy of the 1602 edition at the Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington (PR 1850 1602). These examples are visual rather than verbal in nature, yet they appear consistent with the commemorative intentions of readers who inscribed memorial verses in their copies of Chaucer's writing. Customized Title Pages Scholars have noted how the architectural borders used for early editions of Chaucer's Works bear a visual resemblance to a physical memorial. The title page of Martin's copy of the 1542 edition, crafted by Reverend Mr. Nathaniel Coddington ( figure 3 ), is consistent with this pattern. He carefully cuts and pastes a border identified by R. B. McKerrow and F. S. Ferguson as being in use from 1551 through 1622 (no. 76). 29 For Coddington, the most important information clearly is the identity of the author: "CH|AVC|ER" fills the entirety of the space available for a title, though information about the imprint can be found in manuscript at the bottom of the page: "Printed in 1542. by John Reyne at the signe of the St George | in Pauls Churchyarde ." Another book owner, this time of Cambridge University Library Syn.5.53.1, a copy of the 1532 edition, combines a carefully trimmed border ( McKerrow and Ferguson no. 19) with a title ascribing the book to Caxton's Westminster press ( figure 9 ). One can hazard a fairly good guess at the owner's motivation for doing so since the cachet and resale value of a Caxton would be higher than that of the book with its original 1532 title page. A provenance note by Samuel Sandars addresses the state of the title page: These fragments are NOT printed by Caxton but are portions of the First Edition of Chaucer's entire works, printed in London by Thomas Godfray 1532 folio. The rich border probably by Holbein pasted round the erroneous reprinted title is the original border used for the titles in this edition by Godfray . A different principle seems to be at work in a copy of the 1542 edition at the Harry Ransom Center, which makes use of a printed border ( McKerrow and Ferguson no. 20). A slip written by hand in a manner emulating the black-letter typeface is pasted over the original printed title. The title page for the Romaunt of the Rose, meanwhile, keeps the printed text of the title, accented with fleurons, but discards the rest of the original design ( figure 10 ). Further examination of the book reveals that the owner covers existing marginalia with slips of blank paper pasted in. Since title pages tend to attract ownership inscriptions and pen trials, this particular owner may have decided that the cleanest solution would be to start anew in the case of the Works title page, and to paste the title from the Romaunt of the Rose on a clean page. 30 29.

Customized title pages in a copy of Thynne's 1542 edition. Harry Ransom Center , The University of Texas at Austin (PR 1850 1542b copy 4). These self-fashioned title pages make use of printed elements, but an artistic owner of Thynne's ca. 1550 edition at Wesleyan University Library supplied his or her copy with a title page by drawing a facsimile of the Speght title page ( figure 11 ). Was the 1598 title page used as a model damaged as well? An irregular patch of text is missing, but with penciled ruling to connect words that originally appeared on the same line, on either side of the break. The same or another reader completes partially formed words in pencil and supplies omitted text. It also serves to correct the artist's textual errors, e.g., Figture should read Portraiture in item one; AutPrs should read Authors in item five; and London is instead Londini on the Speght title page. Overall, however, the visual aspect of the page is striking in its rendering of the architectural borders. Capturing the visual grandeur of the page demonstrates the foremost importance to this artist of design rather than words, which are dominant in the other examples. Owners of the books at the British Library ( figure 3 ), the Cambridge University Library ( figure 9 ), the Harry Ransom Center ( figure 10 ), and the Wesleyan University Library ( figure 11 ) thus show a variety of inventive strategies for supplying a title page that was wanting or restoring an imperfect leaf to serve as a more suitable entryway for subsequent readers of the text. The architectural borders of the title page sometimes inspired book owners to affix their own armorial bookplate at the foot of the title page. In a copy at the Cambridge University Library, the bookplate of the Peterborough Cathedral becomes an extension of the architectural border, intentionally integrating it with the printed page ( figure 12 ). Another example of this approach appears in a copy of Thynne's ca. 1550 edition at Trinity College Dublin (V dd 16). The armorial bookplate of Theophilus Butler , esq. which features his motto, "Liberté tout entiere," does indeed take some liberties with the title page design with the addition of his engraved plate. These two examples are making additions not in order to supply wanting material but rather to augment the title page with an ornate symbol of the owner's identity near the marquee billing of Chaucer as author. Frontispiece Portraits Portraits of the author also confer authority, and they sometimes were inserted to serve as a frontispiece in a copy printed without one (see table 2). Adding a portrait equals or exceeds in frequency the occasions where owners inscribed the tomb verses in copies printed without it. Thomas Speght's 1598 edition provides for the first time an engraved portrait of the author by John Speed. That printed image indicates that the artist used a Hoccleve manuscript as his model. Nicholas Perkins finds ample evidence that readers plundered Chaucer portraits from an early point in the transmission history of Hoccleve's De Regimine Principum, a mirror for princes completed ca. 1411, with the outcome that only one manuscript retains the Chaucer portrait, making it possible that Speght is referring to one of these lost images in his 1598 edition. 31 30. At the British Library, a copy of the Canterbury Tales appears to use text clipped from a running title to supply a title page (BL G.11587). FIGURE 11.

Artists' variations could likewise be compared to transcriptions of the Westminster Abbey epitaph, presenting a desire for both authenticity and aggrandizement. Collectors of Chaucer's early printed editions added copies of half-body portraits to their Chaucer editions, pilfered from a variety of sources. The Houbraken portrait serves as a frontispiece for the Browning Chaucer. Another engraving of Chaucer's bust, printed for Robert Baldwin and the London Magazine in 1753, appears on the verso of a fly leaf in a Bishop imprint of the 1602 edition. 37 An even later engraving by John Thurston (1820) can be found in a copy of the 1561 edition at the HRC. A copy of the 1532 edition once owned by Francis Douce (1757-1834) frames the body of the text with images of Chaucer on both the front and the rear pastedowns, opening with a tracing of the Hoccleve miniature and concluding with John Collyer's 1776 engraving. 38 A copy of Speght 's first edition contains at the start of the author's biography a small portrait that appears to be clipped from the title page to Edward Phillips' Moderne World of Words. 39 In one case where the Speed portrait was wanting in a 1602 edition at Trinity College, Cambridge , the owner added a hand-drawn facsimile to serve in place of the engraved portrait ( figure 13 ). Collectors might add extra portraits to copies of Speght 's edition, even if the Speed portrait remained intact. Now did book owners have any qualms about robbing Peter to pay Paul by taking copies of the Speed portrait for use in earlier editions: a copy of John Stow's 1561 edition at the Cambridge University Library, for instance, contains a copy of the Speed portrait ( Keynes S.7.9). 34.

Betsy Bowden wryly observes that "although traditional Chaucer portraiture constitutes an extensive topic, the basic image and pose remained quite consistent," making it no surprise that "the Houghton Library portrait on wood, done by an unknown artist perhaps in the seventeenth century, stands in a long line of sweet-faced, fork-bearded Chaucers who finger pen case and rosary while gazing pensively downward."

The circulation of these portraits merits further exploration, but this collection of examples seems to indicate that Chaucer's visual presence added iconographic worth to books commemorating not just his literary skill but his perceived cultural importance. The ways in which owners of early editions of Chaucer altered their books represent forms of reception that have yet to be considered fully. These readers did more than mark passages with marginalia; through their choice of inscriptions, title-page embellishments, and inserted portraits they sought to provide an overall characterization of the books and their author. These elements, intended as commemorative and meant to be seen and appreciated by others, offer additional ways in which the physical features of books can prompt fresh insights into the cultural perceptions and values of past ages. 40 40.

SIR DEGREVANT IN THE "FINDERN ANTHOLOGY" ( CAMBRIDGE , UNIVERSITY LIBRARY MS FF.1.6) by Michael Johnston * Cambridge , University Library MS Ff.1.6, known as the Findern Anthology (which I will hereafter call it), has long been recognized as one of the most interesting and noteworthy surviving manuscripts of Middle English literature. 1 It contains extended excerpts from John Gower's Confessio amantis , many of the shorter poems of Chaucer , and numerous texts by Hoccleve, Lydgate , Roos, and Clanvowe—in short, a veritable anthology of England's greatest late medieval writers. But this manuscript is also worthy of note for its large number of uniquely surviving lyrics, many of which may have been composed by aristocratic women of Derbyshire and Staffordshire . Some scholars even suggest that women acted as scribes in the manuscript—hence, my gender-neutral he/she pronoun choice when referring to the scribes in what follows. 2 This codex also presents us with * I wish to thank the Huntington Library and the British Academy for their Fellowship for Study in Great Britain, and the Bibliographical Society ( London ) and Bibliographical Society of America for their Fredson Bowers Award, which underwrote the costs for much of this research. I also wish to thank Ralph Hanna , Robyn Malo , and Linda Olson for their comments on drafts of this essay. 1.

Yet in spite of this manuscript's manifestly interesting and valuable content, and the great deal of attention already paid to its codicological make-up, we still know remarkably little about how it was produced and what relationship the texts bear to one another. Was it produced in the household of the Findern family, or of another local family, who subsequently gifted it to the Finderns? Was it copied out by these gentry landowners and their associates, or did the original owners pay scribes already in their employ to copy out these texts? Alternatively, might they have sent off to London to have these texts copied, piecemeal, over a period of time, or hired out a local scriptor to accomplish this? And what of the literary texts? What does the manuscript evidence tell us about what role Chaucer , central to our conception of the Middle English canon, played in the cultural imaginary of these gentry readers? And what role did the only romance in this compilation, Sir Degrevant, play? Most modern critics, after all, lump romances in this period into the broad category of "popular literature," 4 setting them against more courtly productions, like Chaucer's and Gower's , so to see such texts cheek-to-jowl in this manuscript raises questions about these gentry readers and their relation to the cultural pulse of their time. In the mid-fifteenth century, when this manuscript was created, it most likely belonged to the Findern family of Findern, several of whose members signed it. We cannot, however, connect it to them with absolute certainty until the mid-sixteenth century, when two separate notes from this period were inscribed on 3. For an analysis of the various names attested in the manuscript and their connections to local families, see Johnston , Romance and the Gentry, chapter 4; Robbins , "The Findern Anthology," 626–630; and Harris , "The Origins and Make-up," 302–307. 4.

Although in this essay I apply Ockham's razor to the production of this manuscript by calling it the Findern Anthology, were evidence to emerge that the Finderns only acquired it later and that its production should be attributed to a different neighboring family, the analysis to follow would not change substantially. As Kate Harris remarks, referring to the other families whose names appear in this manuscript, it may be just as accurate "to call the manuscript the 'Cotton,' 'Frauncis,' or 'Shirley Anthology,' as it is to refer to the volume as the 'Findern Anthology.' However, such detailed consideration places in dispute neither the social 'milieu' nor the geographical area in which the manuscript was produced: the opposite is the case—it apparently confirms the origins of Ff.1.6 in a country house just to the south of Derby ." 5 Most questions about the manuscript's production and early provenance remain unanswered, previous attempts to provide answers being markedly speculative. Rossell Hope Robbins , for example, suggests that the manuscript arose "through the cooperative efforts of itinerant professional scribes and educated women living in the neighborhood" of the Finderns. 6 The Finderns, if they were indeed the original owners, had numerous connections with London , as Maureen Jurkowski's exhaustive studies of the family demonstrate, lending credence to Robbins's suggestion that they could have hired itinerant scribes from the capital. 7 Ralph Hanna says of the Findern Anthology, "Often considered an example of the spread of London poetic taste into the hinterlands , it was copied in south Derby , almost certainly in a gentry household during the third quarter of the century." 8 In my analysis of the manuscript, I will confirm Hanna's suggestion—that this manuscript was almost certainly produced in Derbyshire in and for a gentry household. The main piece of evidence I will draw upon is my conclusion that the manuscript comprises mutually dependent booklets; that is, none of the codicological units—with a few noteworthy exceptions, as I discuss below—was produced independently of the others. Analyzing the scribal stints and the division of paper stocks across the manuscript reveals that nearly every booklet was made in conjunction with every other booklet, suggesting that most all of it was produced in one place. Given the numerous signatures of these gentry readers, and given the linguistic evidence I have gathered, that place was most certainly a local household. There is one significant exception to the mutually dependent production of the booklets, however: the copy of the romance Sir Degrevant. As I will argue, this text was likely produced separately from, and earlier than, the 5. Harris , "The Origins and Make-up," 307. 6. Robbins , "The Findern Anthology," 611. 7.

Thus, Sir Degrevant stands as the core of this Middle English miscellany, with the more "courtly" literary texts and the uniquely surviving lyrics being added around this core. The Booklets Of The Findern Anthology In any analysis of the composition of this manuscript, the question of booklets is of the first order. 9 Kate Harris , whose study of this manuscript's make-up is impeccable, argued that it does not break down into individual booklets but rather was planned as a single codicological unit. However, Ralph Hanna subsequently demonstrated, using Harris's evidence, that indeed the Findern Anthology does comprise a series of independent fascicles, produced as separate units and only later brought together into a single volume. 10 The appearance of the same scribe and same paper stock across the various sections, Hanna shows, is not evidence against the case for fascicularity, as Harris contended, but rather in favor of it. Hanna goes on to identify where individual texts correspond with the end of a quire, a likely sign of the completion of a booklet. The booklets of the Findern Anthology divide up as follows. In this division, I follow Hanna's earlier assessment, with the exception of his Booklet V, containing Sir Degrevant, whose concluding quires were produced separately, as I argue below. Hanna offers the following division into booklets: 11 Booklet I: quires A-B-C, fols. 3–20, 29–44 Booklet II: 12 quire bb, fols. 21–28 Booklet III: 13 quire E-D, fols. 45–63, 68–76 Booklet IV: 14 quire e, fols. 64–67 Booklet V: quires F-G-H, fols. 81-115 Booklet VI: quires I-K-L-M, fols. 116–142 Booklet VII: quire N, fols. 143 -164 9.

Robinson , "'The Booklet': A Self-Contained Unit in Composite Manuscripts," Codicologica 3 (1980): 46–69; Ralph Hanna , Pursuing History: Middle English Manuscripts and Their Texts (Stanford, CA: Stanford Univ.

Fols. 77–80 are unaccounted for in the manuscript's current foliation. Henry Bradshaw initially postulated the existence of a lost quire of 4 folios between 76 and 81, to which he assigned numbers. However, the more recent collation rejects Bradshaw's hypothesis and thus eliminates fols. 77–80 from its count. Likewise, Bradshaw posited an outer bifolium of quire O, which he numbered fols. 165 and 180. These numbers also do not exist in the current foliation. See Beadle and Owen , Introduction, The Findern Manuscript, ix–xi. 12. An independently produced quire nested inside quire B. Hanna , "The Production," 65, identifies fols. 22–28 as comprising quire bb, calling this quire an 8, wanting the first leaf. However, I have emended this to encompass fol. 21, which, though now a stub, must have originally been part of this quire and was subsequently excised or damaged and lost. Thus, this quire must have been a complete 8 when originally produced, with the first leaf left blank. 13. Now bound as D, then E, though originally copied as E, then D. 14. An independently produced quire nested inside quire E. Booklet VIII: quire O, fols. 166–179 Booklet IX: quire P, fols. 181–188 Since the ending of Sir Degrevant in Booklet V was, I will argue, produced separately, I hereafter modify Hanna's division by subdividing this booklet into Va (the part that was produced along the same lines as the rest of the manuscript) and Vb (produced separately). My own analysis reveals that each of these booklets, save II, IV, Vb and VII, is mutually dependent, with paper stocks, scribes, or exemplars connecting them to the other booklets. Such a state of mutually dependent booklets strongly suggests that all these parts of the manuscript—that is, almost the entirety of the Findern Anthology—was made by a team working together. By the term team, I do not mean to suggest that the production of the manuscript was an organized affair, as all the evidence points to quite ad hoc methods. Rather, the appearance of the same scribes and materials in so many of these booklets indicates that they were produced near one another within a relatively small window of time. The logical conclusion to follow from this is that this team was local, somehow connected to the region of these gentry readers, either as scribes already in their employ or available for hire from a nearby town (perhaps Derby ?), a conclusion affirmed by my linguistic analysis, discussed below. In assessing the relationship between the component parts of this manuscript, we must start with the watermarks and scribal stints. If a watermark or stint appears in multiple booklets, then we can reasonably assume that the production of those two booklets is connected—likely made in the same locale in a time not too far from one another (excluding a scribe who added "filler" to the end of a booklet, which could always be done after the completion of the main scribal stints). As I will show, all the booklets—save four—are mutually dependent. Two of these four outliers (viz. Booklets II and IV) may have been produced commercially, purchased and placed within the compilation, as I discuss below. But in the case of Sir Degrevant, as I will show, its booklet should be considered the centerpiece of this codex. One of the watermarks, by itself, unites much of this manuscript: Mark 4, that is, can be found in Booklets III, VI, VIII and IX. 15 To this we can add the evidence of common scribal stints: in particular Scribe 6 appears in Booklets III and VI, which both contain the common watermark 4, as well as Booklet I, thereby bringing Booklet I into the orbit of sections of this manuscript that must have been produced together. 16 Scribe 6 writes in a very erect Secretary script, dotting his/her –i with a long stroke that runs upward at a 45-degree angle, putting a cross through his/her double –l, and employing a large otiose stroke on final –n. Moreover, he/she alternates between an Anglicana and Secretary –w, with the Anglicana form of this graph particularly noteworthy because of the scribe's unusual practice of separating the two loops of its body. In sum, then, my palaeo- 15. Throughout, I follow the numbering of the watermarks in Harris , "The Origins and Make-up," 329–331, whose work is remarkably accurate and thorough. I offer a few corrections to Harris's watermark identifications below in note 42. 16. Throughout, I follow the identification of scribal stints in Harris , "The Origins and Make-up," 331–333. graphical analysis confirms the identity of Harris's scribe 6 across three distinct sections of this manuscript. The use of a common exemplar for the selections from Gower's Confessio amantis further supports the connections between these booklets, and also draws Booklet Va into this grouping of mutually dependent parts: as Harris elsewhere shows, all of the selections from Gower's Confessio in this manuscript derive from a common exemplar. 17 In this case, the Gower bits appear in Booklets I and III (already connected via watermarks) and Va. The appearance of Mark 4, Scribe 6, and a common Gower exemplar in much of this manuscript leaves only Booklets II, IV, Vb and VII unaccounted for. Booklet VII was certainly produced locally and should thus be thought of as similar to the mutually dependent booklets discussed above. It contains a single composite quire, one Hanna aptly labels a "monster." 18 This quire is definitely an anomaly within this compilation, for its opening and closing leaves are left blank and it is filled entirely with lyrics, most of which survive uniquely in this volume. This quire provided the main place for these gentry readers to copy out their own lyrics, placing them in a self-contained quire that could easily be passed around to allow for various individuals to try their hand at poetasting. Such a condition would explain the unusual circumstance of the opening and closing leaves being blank. The composite nature of this quire, with individual bifolia being added accretively, would underwrite the informal and ad-hoc nature of amateur lyric composition, for surely the addition of these lyrics did not require any great planning but was rather done on the spur of the moment. The Finderns, then, reserved this quire for their less formal writing. This leaves us only with Booklets II, IV and Vb as potentially produced separately from the rest of the manuscript. In fact, I think it quite likely that all three of these sections were produced separately from the remainder of this codex. Booklets II and IV are, as Harris shows and as Hanna confirms, later additions nested inside of quires B and E, respectively. Booklet II, was, I would argue, likely produced commercially, purchased by the Finderns and added to already-constructed quires within their growing compilation of Middle English verse. One clue to its commercial production comes in the quality of script and the attention paid to its mise-en-page, something noticeably lacking in the rest of this manuscript, one which Ethel Seaton rightly describes as a "very unprofessional manuscript." 19 This quire contains Clanvowe's Book of Cupid, copied in a quite competent Secretary script, with even spacing between stanzas, which lends the page a clean and pleasing appearance, as if the scribe put a good deal of planning into the execution of the text. 20 The second independent booklet is IV, which contains the story of Piramus 17. Harris , "Ownership and Readership: Studies in the Provenance of the Manuscripts of Gower's Confessio amantis " ( D.Phil . thesis, University of York, 1993), 41, shows that "Collation of the Gower extracts reveals that they derive from a second recension source, presumably a single copy remaining available to all the copyists concerned." 18.

This booklet does contain the hand of the ubiquitous Scribe 4, though his stint comes on the final leaf of the quire, where he copies a filler lyric. The appearance of his hand adding filler to the quire does not undermine the case for the separate production of this quire since scribe 4 could easily have added this lyric upon the acquisition of the quire. and Thisbe from Chaucer's Legend of Good Women. Like the scribe of Booklet II, this scribe has left a space for a two-line initial, something one would expect of a booklet produced by a commercial scribe, leaving the owner to have the initial executed—should he/she desire. The most important piece of evidence pointing to separate production for these two booklets is that neither their paper stock nor their scribes appear elsewhere in the Findern Anthology. Given all this evidence, it is quite likely that these were produced by scriptores, but whether in London or some other book-producing city I have not been able to determine. 21 There is precedence for the commercial production of independent booklets containing the works of important Middle English authors (as these two booklets contain): Julia Boffey and John J. Thompson survey numerous such "mini-anthologies" of Middle English authors circulating in the fifteenth century. 22 Such an origin also seems quite likely for these "two extraneous units," 23 leaving only Booklet Vb. Sir Degrevant in the Findern Anthology Booklets Va and Vb contain the following texts: Booklet Va (quire F, fols. 81 –88; quire G, fols. 89–99): Gower , Confessio amantis, Book IV, ll. 2746–2926; fols. 81r–84r Gower, Confessio amantis, Book VIII, ll. 271–846; fols. 84v–95r → fol. 95v blank Sir Degrevant, ll. 1 –564; fols. 96r–99v → one leaf cancelled after fol. 99 Booklet Vb (quire H, fols. 100 -115): Sir Degrevant, ll. 565–end; fols. 100r–109v Chronicle of English kings and saints; fols. 110r–113r Heraldic notes; fol. 113r–v → fols. 114—115 missing, likely cancelled Booklet Vb, consisting only of Quire H, was, I will argue here, produced separately from the rest of the Findern Anthology and was likely acquired early in the process of building up the compilation. Hanna believes that quires F, G, and H form a single booklet, which he labels Booklet V: "F–G have in common stock 7 (F also includes a unique sheet of stock 6). H contains the separate 21.

The phrase comes from Hanna , "The Production," 65. unique stock 8, but given the shift of scribal stints at the boundary of quires F and G noted above, this variation simply reflects the paper available to a scribe who may not even have copied in physical proximity to other producers of the manuscript. But the common and unique stocks suggest a separate fascicle." 24 There is good reason for Hanna's conclusion since the manuscript's copy of Sir Degrevant straddles the divide between quires G and H, usually a sure sign that two quires are part of a common codicological unit. Hanna here recognizes that F–G and H may not have been produced together, though he still denominates them a single booklet: the cancelled leaf at the end of G, he writes, "reflects, not a fascicle boundary, but the effort at regularizing the mid-text border between two scribal stints." 25 In this case, however, quires F–G, containing the beginning of Sir Degrevant, and quire H, containing its conclusion, should be considered separate booklets—with respect to their production. That is, H was likely produced earlier and F–G later. Of course, since H was bound up with F–G, the three quires form a single booklet, as refers to their usage by the Finderns and their associates. In this case, establishing facts about the production of these quires is essential to dating the manuscript as a whole, for quire H contains the only securely internal evidence for its copying date. It would appear that this romance was originally copied as a single text spanning two quires but that the opening quire was subsequently lost and a later scribe added the beginning, possibly from a different exemplar, to what is now quire G. In short, to borrow the terminology developed by Erik Kwakkel , F–G and H represent distinct production units but the same usage unit, and thus I label F-G as booklet Va and H as booklet Vb. 26 Without question, in its present state in the manuscript, there are two scribes responsible for Sir Degrevant, each contributing to independent quires. Scribe 21 copied the opening 564 lines of the poem, with the end of his/her stint corresponding with the end of quire G, and what I believe to be the end of Booklet Va, followed by a cancelled leaf. Scribe 22 copied the concluding lines of the poem. 27 There are two cancelled leaves at the conclusion of Quire H, which also coincides with the end of a text—a sure sign that this marks the end of a booklet. But there is plenty of evidence that the two Degrevant sections were not produced together but were only subsequently joined, thus working against the idea that they were initially produced as a single booklet. To begin with, quire H is on a paper stock that appears nowhere else in the manuscript. 28 The scribes in quire H are also not attested elsewhere in the manuscript, further evidence for the unique production circumstances of this particular quire. 29 The second Degrevant-scribe is clearly a more experienced textual copyist than the first scribe: he/she writes 24.

For side-by-side, full-color reproductions of the work of the two Degrevant-scribes, see Kerby-Fulton , Hilmo , and Olson , Opening up Middle English Manuscripts, Images 34a and 34b (p. 141). 28. As Harris , "The Origins and Make-up," 330, notes, this watermark is a very close match with Briquet 13055 (Draguignan, 1453). 29. These are Harris's Scribes 22–24. in a relatively neat Anglicana media hand. It is noteworthy that he/she is the only scribe in the whole manuscript to employ an Anglicana script, which again points to separate production circumstances from the rest of the volume—separate also from the opening lines of Sir Degrevant. His/her hand is marked by a notable effort to include "feet" at the base of each minim, though it does grow progressively sloppier towards the end of the stint. Further compounding this sense of different circumstances of production for Sir Degrevant is the fact that the quire containing the second stint is one of the few in the manuscript that has evidence of pricking and ruling. The scribe here uses a regular number of lines/page, and he/she has added decorative strokes to the letters on the top line of many leaves, all features lacking in almost all the other texts in this manuscript. The stint of the first Degrevant -scribe is remarkably less well executed, and looks more like the amateur efforts of the other scribes in the Findern Anthology. He/she writes in a very sloppy Secretary hand, correcting the text in a haphazard fashion and exhibiting great variation in the number of lines/column. 30 He/she also frequently pushes too hard on the pen, resulting in ink bleed throughout the copying stint. Moreover, this scribe—unlike the second Degrevant -scribe—has not pricked or ruled his/her page, resulting in quite uneven margins. Both Degrevant scribes copied their texts in double-columns, a standard format for Middle English verse romances but one found nowhere else in this manuscript. However, since the second scribe ruled the page, his/her columns appear neat and tidy, as I noted. The first scribe, by contrast, did not rule the page, yet still wrote in double columns. Since, as I argue below, I believe the second scribe actually copied his/her section earlier than the first, it is a possibility that the first scribe (working later) was attempting to reproduce the mise-en-page of the second scribe, though without taking the time to rule the page, and thus the final product is much less pleasing. Moreover, it appears that, as both Hanna and John Thompson note, the scribe of the first Degrevant stint begins to cram more material onto the page as he/she gets closer to the completion of copying, indicating that he/she was trying to make the work fit into the end of a quire so that it would meet up with an already-completed section of text. 31 The conclusion I draw from this fact is that the second scribal portion of Sir Degrevant was already completed and the first scribe was copying out the opening lines and thus had to make the ending of his/her section match up with the beginning of the second scribe's part. Moreover, the fact that a leaf was cancelled at the end of G further supports my suggestion that the first Degrevant -scribe was trying to make his/her portion of text match up with an already-completed section. The textual evidence from quires F and G also contributes to the impression that these two quires were produced after quire H and were made to fit with what was already in that quire. In particular, the textual selection from Gower's Confessio that immediately precedes the opening of Sir Degrevant does not con- 30. See, for example, the corrections on fol. 96ra and the case of dittography at the top of fol. 96vb. This scribe uses as few as thirty lines/column (fol. g6ra) and as many as forty (fols. 99rb, 99va). 31. Hanna , "The Production," 64 n.5; and Thompson , "Collecting Middle English Romances," 36. tain a coherent narrative, but rather stops abruptly, unlike other selections from Gower in this manuscript. Every other Gower text in the Findern Anthology exhibits some coherence, standing alone as a text with clear beginning, middle and end. 32 But the selection in quires F and G ends quite abruptly, with no clear resolution to the tale. This particular selection, spanning fols. 84v–95r, covers lines 271–846 of Book VIII—"The Tale of Apollonius of Tyre"—commencing where the tale proper begins, omitting Genius's prolix disquisition on incest in Old Testament times and going straight into the story of Apollonius. The beginning of the selection, that is, was well chosen and makes narrative sense. The selection concludes, however, in a rather odd spot in the narrative, right where the Princess of Pentapolim has fallen in love with Apollonius: "Touchinge þis man of Tire / Hir hirt is hot as eny fire" (fol. 95r). There is no obvious reason to wrap up the selection here, for the love between these two characters has only just begun. All the other selections leave off at an obvious stopping point, leading to the conclusion that the scribes who copied "The Tale of Apollonius" did not adequately plan for how much space they would need. Once they neared the middle of quire G, these scribes likely stopped copying in anticipation of the space needed for the opening 564 lines of Sir Degrevant, which is copied into the final four folios of this quire. Or, quite possibly, the first Degrevant -scribe had already begun copying this romance into the end of quire G, and the scribes of Gower's text realized they needed to truncate their text. Whatever their motivation, these scribes then left fol. 95v—the folio between the end of "Apollonius" and the beginning of Sir Degrevant —blank, likely when they realized that there was no way to reach a suitable stopping point in the narrative, giving up and leaving off copying with no real conclusion to the text. 33 The dialectal evidence likewise contributes to the impression of difference between these two scribal stints. 34 Scribe 2 can be localized rather confidently 32. The first Gower selection comes from the "Tale of Tereus" (fols. 3r–5r; Book V, ll. 5921–6052). This selection fittingly concludes with Genius's précis of the tale's moral: "ffor yff þ u be off soche couyne / To gete off loue by rauyne / Thy lust yt may þe ffall þus / As yt ffyll to tereus" (fol. 5r). The second selection comes from the "Tale of Rosiphilee" (fols. 5r–10v; Book IV, ll. 1114–1466). This is a self-contained narrative about how Rosiphelee was idle in her attitude to love and learned, by meeting a train of love's servants in the woods, to dedicate herself more firmly to love. The third Gower selection is from the well-known "Tale of Three Questions" (fols. 45r–51r; Book I, ll. 3067–3425). This selection, which ends shortly after the knight's daughter has convinced the king to marry her, concludes with Genius's instruction that Amans forget pride and pursue humility. The fourth selection from the Confessio is Amans's discussion of somnolence (fols. 81r–84r; Book IV, ll. 2746–2926). In Gower's text, Amans's speech precedes the "Tale of Ceix and Alcione ," but here it is used as a prologue to the "Tale of Apollonius of Tyre." The ending of Amans's discourse nicely segues into the opening of "Apollonius," a sign that the compilers of the Findern Manuscript were careful about the textual pairings they created. Here, at the end of Amans's speech, Genius says, "To tel a tale ther upon / Whych fel be olde days gon" (fol. 84r). The "Tale of Apollonius" then begins overleaf with, "Of a croniq ue in day gon / The which is clepyd pantheon" (fol. 84v). This pairing creates concatenation, pleasingly joining two unrelated sections of Gower's text. 33. Cf. Hanna , "The Production," n.11, who says that this blank leaf "simply reflects the aesthetic preferences of the scribes—the desire to begin the next (substantial) work in a prominent position at the head of a recto." 34. Hanna , "The Production," 66, suggests that this romance "was plainly copied from a split exemplar," though he gives no justification for this. I presume Hanna is referring to the codicological evidence. As I argue here, the variation between the two scribes’ linguistic forms may also support such a suggestion; however, the first scribe’s forms are so mixed that it is difficult to reach any firm conclusions about his/her exemplar and dialect. to the area of southern Derbyshire, southeastern Staffordshire, northwestern Leicestershire, or north-central Warwickshire (i.e., an area within twenty miles or so of the Finderns and their associates). The following forms help us to localize him/her such: They: thei (they) (Dot Map 30) 35 Each: ylke (Dot Map 84) Much: mychel (michel, muchel) (Dot Map 109) Might: my3th (mote, mete) (Dot Map 330) Did (sg/pl): dude (Dot Map 400) Fire: fuyre (Dot Map 412) 36 Scribe 1, by contrast, has seemingly concocted a thoroughgoing Mischsprache . He/she attests a wide diversity of linguistic forms from several mutually exclusive linguistic regions. The most prominent of these isoglosses include: Her: hur. This form is attested throughout the West, Southwest, and Southeast (Dot Map 23). Them: hom (hem, tham): Hom , his predominant form, is attested most strongly in the Northwest Midlands, not far from Derbyshire, and is only attested in scattered form elsewhere (Dot Map 48). His secondary forms present somewhat contradictory evidence: tham , for example, is a northern feature (Dot Map 41), whereas the – h forms of this pronoun, as used by this scribe in hem , are not found in the North (Dot Map 40). Such: swych (suche, seche): Swych is attested everywhere but the Central Midlands and the Northwest; i.e., not in Derbyshire (Dot Map 74). Each: ych (eche, ilk): Ych is a Midlands and East Anglian form (Dot Map 87); eche is found in East Anglia, the Southeast and Southwest, but rarely in the 35. A. McIntosh et al., eds., A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English , 4 vols. ( Aberdeen : Aberdeen Univ. Press, 1986). Dot Maps are found in Volume 1. Here, I follow the practice used in A Linguistic Atlas by listing the scribe's predominant form first, placing secondary forms, if any, in parentheses. 36. Consulting the Item Maps for southern Derbyshire, found in Volume 2 of A Linguistic Atlas , we find almost all of the scribe's forms commonly attested there. A few of the scribe's forms do not fit the usage attested for southern Derbyshire, but in each case the forms can be explained by usages attested in the immediate vicinity. For example, though the scribe writes she as sche or she, forms common throughout Derbyshire, on occasion he uses forms beginning with –h. Though only attested infrequently in Derbyshire, this form of the pronoun can be found more commonly in Staffordshire and Warwickshire , both adjacent counties. In total, the scribe's forms are quite similar to LP 140 ( London , Lambeth Palace Library MS 223), located at Grid 435 336 (see A Linguistic Atlas 3:71 – 72), just a few miles from Findern . The Findern scribe's forms differ from LP 140 at they, each, many, man, fire, through, do (pt), such, enough , and give; however, the scribe's forms of the first five of these points of divergence from LP 140 are commonly attested in Leicestershire ; while his forms of do (pt) are common throughout Warwickshire ; and his preferred form of such (beginning with – sw) can be found just north, in the West Riding (See Item Map 10, Region 3). That is to say, we do not have to look outside the immediate vicinity to explain any of the scribe's preferred forms. In sum, then, it is a fair conclusion that this scribe hails from somewhere in the immediate vicinity of Findern . area of Derbyshire (Dot Map 86); ilk is a Northeast and Northern form (Dot Map 84). From: fram. This form is only attested in the South and does not extend as far north as Derbyshire (Dot Map 174). If: yeff. This form is only attested in the South, and does not extend as far north as Derbyshire (Dot Map 209). Hundred: hondred, houndred. This latter form, houndred , is only attested in the South (Dot Map 450). –ly suffix: –ly (–lech, –lich): –lech is attested in the Midlands, Southeast and Southwest (Dot Map 604). Given that this scribe employs a series of linguistic forms from dialects that are mutually exclusive of one another, and given that he/she uses such a wide variety of forms, it is impossible to determine this scribe's linguistic origin. 37 He/she may well have come from the region of the Finderns and their associates, as I found with Scribe 2, but until one sorts out which forms are scribal and which are from his/her exemplar—something I have not been able to do—any further determination seems impossible. Whether or not these two scribes were from the same place, it is clear that they produced very different texts. So how did the manuscript come to have a bifurcated copy of Sir Degrevant ? The main clue to answering this question comes in the water damage found throughout Quire H, which contains the second Degrevant stint. There is heavy damage throughout the center of each leaf, damage seen nowhere else in this manuscript. 38 This state suggests the possibility that a now-lost quire originally contained the opening of Sir Degrevant and that damage subsequently struck both this and quire H, destroying the now-lost quire and leaving H with stains. The current opening 564 lines of Sir Degrevant were then "retro-fitted" to the conclusion of the poem—made by a different scribe at a different point in time. Given that the second Degrevant -scribe copies about 35 lines/column, a quire of four would have perfectly accommodated the opening 564 lines. Such a scenario, in which what is now the second Degrevant section was actually copied before what is now the first section and originally contained the romance in its entirety, can account for why this second section is remarkably more polished in appearance. It is important to note that the paper stock and scribes of quire H are unique to this quire, appearing nowhere else in the manuscript. This further supports the notion that this bit of Sir Degrevant was produced under circumstances separate from the rest of the manuscript. By contrast, the opening stint of Sir Degrevant is in a quire whose production can be tied to the rest of the Findern Anthology, as I outlined above. Although the scribes of Booklet Va (i.e., quires F–G) do not 37. I thus retract an earlier statement regarding this scribe's forms, as printed in Kerby-Fulton , Hilmo , and Olson , Opening up Middle English Manuscripts , 144 n.198. Olson kindly drew upon an earlier stage of the present work. 38. Note that this damage is only visible when viewing the manuscript in situ. The facsimile obscures it. appear elsewhere, the appearance of selections from Gower's Confessio appearing here tie this quire to the other quires with Gower texts, as they were likely taken from the same exemplar. 39 The Date of Sir Degrevant's Copying As it happens, H is the only securely datable quire in the whole of the Findern Anthology. At the end of this quire, after the completion of Sir Degrevant , a different scribe added a chronicle of the kings of England . On fol. 112v the chronicle lists the length of each English king's reign, but the space beside "herry vj" was left blank, suggesting, as L. F. Casson notes, that "he was therefore still reigning" when this was copied out. 40 On fol. 113r, however, the chronicler provides a more precisely datable entry, something scholars of this manuscript hitherto have missed: "And fro þ e incarnacion of Ih e su crist til þ e xx [blank] of kyng herry vj ml iiijc xlvj 3er." The reference to "ml iiijc xlvj" years from the Incarnation clearly indicates that this text was copied out in 1446, assuming that this scribe was not slavishly copying an earlier chronicle entry at a later date. The first part of the entry, reading "þ e xx [blank] of kyng herry," indicates that the scribe was unsure of the regnal year (which is, after all, more difficult to determine than the calendrical year), knowing only that Henry VI had been reigning for twenty-some-odd years. The most plausible explanation for these facts is that the blank space was left for the final Roman numerals of the regnal year (which, in 1446, would have been 24 or 25 Hen VI), but was never actually filled in. The scribe copied this chronicle at the end of the quire containing part two of Sir Degrevant ; hence, the date of 1446 provides a terminus ad quem for this manuscript's copy of part two of this romance. As I argued above, this quire likely was produced along with another quire containing the opening, now lost. Thus, 1446 would mark the terminus for the original production of the entirety of Sir Degrevant , with the replacement opening quire being added at some indeterminate later point in time. Most analyses of either the script or the watermarks employed in the manuscript as a whole suggest that it was produced in the second half, or even last quarter, of the fifteenth century. 41 My own analysis of the watermarks confirms Harris 's suggestions, which are the most thorough of previous studies of the manuscript, on almost all points. Of course, dating a manuscript via watermark identification is a tricky endeavor, but there are enough different marks in this manuscript to control for the pitfalls of relying on Briquet too heavily. In sum, almost all of the paper dates roughly 39. See note 17, above. 40. The Romance of "Sir Degrevant": A Parallel-Text Edition from MSS.

Richard Beadle and A. E. B. Owen hint at this when they note that "if [ Sir Degrevant ] is not the oldest text in the collection it is certainly the most archaic in diction and metre." 43 So if the original copy of the entirety of Sir Degrevant arose differently from the majority of the Findern Anthology, where might it have been produced? I suggested above that the mutually dependent booklets in this manuscript were most likely produced by a team working within the region of the Findern s and their associates. My linguistic analysis of the second Degrevant -scribe reveals that he/she hailed from quite near the Findern s' home, which suggests that this romance was similarly a local production. Such an origin for these booklets accords well with Hanna's sense that the entire manuscript "seems typical of that informal creation of literary artifacts which one associates with the aristocratic menage, not the stationer." 44 The "aristocratic menage," in fact, seems responsible for many of the surviving copies of Middle English romance from this period. It was, after all, a period in which anyone with access to paper, ink, and exemplars, and who was able to read and write, could produce his/her own books. Or, if one were disinclined to undertake the copying oneself, trained documentary producers and unbeneficed clerics were always at hand, often probably underemployed. The skills of reading and writing, of course, were limited, but the English mercantile classes and the landowning gentry—families like the Findern s—were the very sorts of people who would possess such skills. In the century before Caxton set up his press in Westminster , numerous such aristocratic menages gave rise to manuscripts of romance, as well as other sorts of vernacular literary texts. The Findern s and their associates were just a part of what Curt F. Bühler calls the "every man his own scribe" movement of the fifteenth century. 45 The manuscript they left us is remarkable, for it shows us the wide range of gentry readers who handled this manuscript. But it also shows us, as I hope I have now shown, the central place that Middle English romance played in their literary and cultural world. 42. See Harris, "The Origins and Make-up," 329–331. A few demurrals from Harris's findings: her Mark 1 cannot be Briquet 2821—it is definitely a boeuf , though there is no satisfactory match in Briquet. There are, however, a number of similar boeufs in the range of Briquet 2812–20, which all date from the middle of the fifteenth century. Likewise, Harris suggests Briquet 4641 for Mark 11, which is not a tight match. I found Harris's suggestion for Watermarks 2–4 and 6–9 to be excellent matches with her suggested Briquet numbers. Marks 5, 10, 12 and 13 are so obscured by the gutter of this quarto manuscript that I found them nearly impossible to identify, though her suggestions are reasonable, given what is visible of the watermarks. 43.

Gwara In 1993, Frank Stubbings announced the sensational discovery of three sixteenth-century English printed fragments in the library of Emmanuel College, Cambridge . 1 Extracted from the contemporary London binding of an octavo volume printed in Frankfurt in 1540, these fragments together formed a single complete folio, signed F2, from a lost quarto edition of a prose romance featuring the pseudo-Roman characters Affranio and Hortensia. 2 Although the work itself was unknown, Dennis E. Rhodes , who collaborated with Stubbings, identified the font as Wynkyn de Worde's 95mm textura in its final state, observing that the grotesque initial 'I' on the recto was found elsewhere in de Worde's corpus. On the strength of this information, Stubbings concluded that the folio was printed by de Worde between 1521 and 1535. At the same time, he acknowledged that the fragments did not match any surviving de Worde book from the period. Six years later, Rhodes identified the Emmanuel College text as a previously unrecorded English translation of La historia de Grisel y Mirabella , a late medieval Spanish romance by Juan de Flores ( fl. 1475). 3 With translations and adaptations in French, German, Italian, and Polish (among other languages), Flores's work became an international best-seller in the sixteenth century, marketed initially as 1.

The manuscript fragments are now catalogued as Emmanuel College MS 405; the printed fragments, as MS 405A. 3. Dennis E.

He based this deduction on the fact that the Italian text, first printed in Milan in 1521, substituted the names Affranio and Hortensia for Torrellas and Braçayda (Cressida), the analogous Spanish characters. He went on to speculate that the Emmanuel translation—or paraphrase, as he described it—of the Italian was undertaken around 1525 and printed by de Worde around 1530. He implied that another English translation, found in the 1556 quadrilingual edition published in Antwerp by Jan Steels (STC 11092), was distantly related to the Emmanuel College text, being perhaps a revision by a non-native speaker of English. 5 In an article published in March 2005, Joyce Boro refuted nearly all of Rhodes's conclusions by demonstrating that the immediate source of the English text was not the 1521 Italian version of Flores's romance but rather a French translation of the Italian text known as Le Iugement d'amour. 6 Boro listed nine French editions of this work, mostly from the late 1520s and early 1530s. 7 She went on to show that the English text in the Emmanuel College fragment was a 4.

Rhodes, "A Lost Romance," 466. A variant of the Steels edition bears the imprint of Juan Latio (STC 11092 a), evidently a co-publisher. The English text was reprinted in the 1608 quadrilingual edition printed in Brussels by Jean Mommart (STC 11093.5), which has a variant bearing the imprint of Jean Mommart and Jean Reyns (STC 11093). 6.

Boro, "A Source and Date," 426. Boro's list of editions is inaccurate and somewhat confusing. Elsewhere in the same article, for example, she claims that "the French translation was printed fourteen times from 1520? to 1568" (424). This total actually conflates the editions of Le Iugement d'amour and those of another translation, attributed to Gilles Corrozet, first published in Paris in 1546 but based in part, as Boro herself argues (427–430), on an earlier edition of Le Iugement d'amour . For further discussion, see Jean Beaufilz , Jugement d'amour , ed. Irene Finotti , Textes de la Renaissance 160 (Paris: Éditions Classiques Garnier, 2009), 81–99, with some information repeated in Irene Finotti , "Nouvelles langues, nouveaux publics: le cas de deux romans sentimentaux," Le Français préclassique 1500–1650 , 14 (2012), 199–212, at 204–207. Two studies by Maria Colombo Timelli treat stylistic aspects of the Corrozet translation: "La première édition bilingue de L'histoire d'Aurelio et d'Isabel (Gilles Corrozet, Paris , 1546)—ou: Quelques problèmes de traduction d'italien en français au XVI e siècle," in Traduction et adaptation en France à la fin du Moyen Age et à la Renaissance: Actes du Colloque organisé par l'Université de Nancy II, 23 –25 mars 1995 , ed.

Key variants allowed her to identify the Lyon edition of Olivier Arnoullet as the most likely basis of the English text, but erroneous information from outdated secondary sources led her to propose an imprecise terminus post quem of 1527 for the original quarto. 8 More reliably, she disproved Rhodes 's conjecture that the 1556 English translation of the romance, reprinted in 1608, was a revision of the Emmanuel text, although she continued to accept his attribution of the leaf to de Worde. In the present study, I discuss a number of technical issues concerning the production of the Emmanuel College fragment. Based on an analysis of its types and ornamental initial, I reassign the leaf to the Rose Garland press of Robert Copland (d. 1547?). The state of this initial, coupled with new information about the work's French source, leads me to propose a revised printing date of either 1531 or 1533. Using the French translation as a guide, I go on to reconstruct the English edition from which the Emmanuel College leaf derives. I conclude by observing that the anonymous translator was almost certainly Copland himself. This deduction suggests that although Copland's known translations of French romances date from the time of his apprenticeship with de Worde (probably 1505–13), he continued to translate such works throughout his printing career. Physical Description. Measuring 183/4 × 154mm, the Emmanuel College fragment consists of a single folio (183/4 × 136mm), with thirty-two lines of type occupying a printed area of 150 × 96mm, plus a narrow stub that runs the entire height of the leaf about 18mm beyond the gutter fold (see figures 1 and 2). A remnant of the original conjugate leaf, this stub exhibits only the first letter of each word in the last fourteen lines on the verso: i, f, b, n/m, p, v, n/m, c, w, p, t, c, t, o. The remaining text on the stub is illegible, having been either closely cropped or completely trimmed off. Running horizontally across the center of the folio are two slightly angled cuts—the work of a careless binder—essentially separating the leaf into two halves, one of which was found in each board. One cut falls just below line 16 and the other just above line 18. Converging in line 17, they form a triangular wedge of paper measuring 4mm at the widest point. These cuts partially obscure the last word of line 16 on the recto ("them") and obliterate the first half of line 17 on the verso. 9 Each fragment is also damaged by four pairs of parallel bradawl holes, measuring 10–12mm across the rows, for the cords of the octavo binding. At the foot of the leaf, the bradawl holes are considerably smaller, and the bottom row is cropped, making the holes look like indentations along the edge of the paper. In spite of this damage—and minor worming close to the text in the outer margin—the folio is almost completely legible, and all the lost material can be reconstructed on the basis of the remaining letter outlines and the text's French source. 8. As far as I can tell, Boro obtained most of her bibliographical information from Barbara Matulka , The Novels of Juan de Flores and Their European Diffusion: A Study in Comparative Literature ( New York : Institute of French Studies, 1931; repr. Geneva : Slatkine, 1974), 466—467. 9. During conservation in the spring of 2004, these three pieces were reattached and the entire leaf encapsulated in Mylar. FIGURE 1. Emmanuel College, Cambridge , MS 405A, sig. F2 r . Reproduced by courtesy of the Master and Fellows of Emmanuel College, Cambridge . To date, no one has observed in print that the Emmanuel leaf has a partial watermark consisting of a shield bearing the French royal arms and surmounted by a coronet with strawberry leaves and pearls (see figure 3 ). The base of the coronet is 25.5mm wide. The measurement across the center of the shield is 24mm, and the distance from the base of the coronet to the tip of the shield measures 29/30mm. FIGURE 2. Emmanuel College, Cambridge , MS 405A, sig. F2 v . Reproduced by courtesy of the Master and Fellows of Emmanuel College, Cambridge . Most of the upper part of the watermark has been trimmed away, while the design beneath the shield, which might have contained a maker's mark, has been mutilated by a bradawl hole. This lower area has also been partially obscured by the fibers used to reattach the fragments. For the sake of completeness, I provide two sets of chain line measurements taken from left to right across the recto, rotated 90° clockwise. 10 FIGURE 3. Emmanuel College, Cambridge , MS 405 a, watermark. Reproduced by courtesy of the Master and Fellows of Emmanuel College, Cambridge . The first set represents the distances between chain lines running along the gutter edge of the quarto leaf (top); the second, along the outside margin (bottom): Top: 20mm (trimmed) | 28mm | 25.5mm | (cut) | 26.5mm | 27mm | 25mm | (trimmed) Bottom: 17.5mm (trimmed) | 29mm | 26mm | (cut) | 27.5mm | 27.5mm | 24.5mm (trimmed) The watermark itself is divided by the cut that falls between the two central chain lines. During the course of conservation, the design ( R. Carter Hailey's "mugshot") was reported to resemble Briquet no. 1771 ( Neubourg , 1548) and, to a lesser degree, no. 1769 ( Fontaine-Guérard , 1555). 11 My own inspection reveals a considerably different design not illustrated in Briquet but broadly conforming to his nos. 1710–88, with a date range of 1458 to 1580 (though mostly dating before 1540). 12 The appended design (beneath the shield) may represent a single letter or cipher as in Briquet nos. 1735 (Utrecht, 1519) and 1736 (Argences, 1528), although a cross or cruciform floral pattern similar to nos. 1710-17 (1516-33) remains plausible. A more accurate description, if permitted by the state of the leaf, would require beta-radiography or another enhancement technique. I have not observed this exact watermark in a systematic review of post-1525 Wynkyn de Worde books in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Typographical Analysis. Referring to an independent typographical analysis carried out by Dennis E. Rhodes , Stubbings asserted that the font used to print the Emmanuel College fragment was Wynkyn de Worde's 95mm textura in its final state, datable between 1521 and 1535. 13 This conclusion does not stand up to scrutiny. The condition of the fragment makes it impossible to measure twenty consecutive lines of type, but the ten-line measurement of 47.5mm confirms the 95mm body size. The characteristic lowercase sorts are s 3 , w 3 , and y 2 , with w 3 also serving as a capital. 14 Although these type sorts are individually attested in de Worde's books between 1526 and 1535—the period that most concerns us here—they are almost always commingled with other sorts. In table 1, I list the five sorts for lowercase s, w, and y found in a comprehensive sample of de Worde's post-1525 textura books, indicating with a check mark those sorts that appear 10. I follow the methodology for describing watermarks summarized by R. Carter Hailey , "The Dating Game: New Evidence for the Dates of Q4 Romeo and Juliet and Q4 Hamlet ," Shakespeare Quarterly , 58 (2007), 368-387, at 372-373, 376-377. 11. C. M.

(Amsterdam: The Paper Publications Society (Labarre Foundation), 1968), 1:132. The Emmanuel watermark is not illustrated in Edward Heawood , "Sources of Early English Paper-Supply," The Library, 4th ser., 10 (1929-30), 282-307, 427-454, although his nos. 5 (301) and 92 (439) are similar. 12. Briquet, Les Filigranes, 1:127-128 (commentary), 129-132 (descriptions). Paper with these watermarks was produced in multiple localities throughout France. In his introduction, Stevenson observes that the French arms with appended single-line letters are typical of Norman mills (1:*61, referring to Briquet nos. 1771–73, 1775–77, 1779–81, 1783–85, 1787). 13. Stubbings, "A New Manuscript," 331. See also Rhodes, "A Lost Romance," 463. 14. I use the type nomenclature established by Frank Isaac , English &amp; Scottish Printing Types, 1501–35 * 1508–41, Facsimiles and Illustrations 2 ( London : The Bibliographical Society, 1930), figure 1 (keyplate). The information in this source supersedes that in Frank Isaac , "Types Used by Wynkyn de Worde , 1501–34," The Library, 4th ser., 9 (1930), 395–409. at least once on every folio of a given volume. As we can see, the s-sort used throughout this period is s 3 , exactly as attested in the Emmanuel College fragment. In addition, many of de Worde's books from 1526 to 1531 exhibit a mixture of y 1 and y 2 sorts in the lower case. In 1532, y 1 all but vanishes, either because the sort had been purged (as suggested by the y 1 fouls in books from 1532 and 1533) or because the case(s) stocked with y 1 sorts had been disposed of—or both, assuming that multiple cases are involved. Like the s 3 sorts generally, then, the y 2 sorts that continue to appear in de Worde's post-1531 books are consistent with the y 2 sorts in the Emmanuel College fragment. Nevertheless, all of de Worde's books from 1531 to 1535 also exhibit a uniform blend of small w 3 and w 3 sorts in the lowercase w-box. Since the Emmanuel fragment is printed with w 2 sorts only and has no small w 2 sorts, we can conclude that if de Worde printed this leaf, he could not have done so after 1531. The situation is more complex for the subset of books that de Worde printed from 1526 to 1531. As I have mentioned, most de Worde items from this period exhibit a combination of y 1 and y 2 sorts in the lower case; for the most part, lowercase w is also a mixture of two different type sorts, small w 2 and w 3 . Although these sort combinations point away from de Worde as the printer of the Emmanuel fragment, it turns out that de Worde actually owned a textura case stocked with s 3 , w 3 , and y 2 sorts—exactly as seen in the Emmanuel fragment—but fouled (or possibly supplemented) with a number of small w 2 sorts. At least fifteen books, in whole or in part, were apparently set from this case: STC 17532 (15 Feb. 1526), 23168.7 (1526), 23169 (1526) (sigs. A1,2,7,8 plus the outer forme of sigs. A3,4,5,6), 25577 (1526), 922.4 (1527)[part 2], 6830 (1528), 14109.5 [c. 1528], 14125.5 [1528?], 23173 (1528), 23148a [1529], 23174 (1529), 23908 (3 Aug. 1529), 17541 (1530) (sigs. A1 v ,) A3, A4, B1 r , B2, B3, D2, D3, FI v , F4 r only), 25422 (20 Dec. 1530), and 1988.6 [1533?]. 15 Given the low proportion of small w 2 sorts among the standard w 3 sorts in this case, books with a comparatively low density of English text-the seven Latin grammars (STC 23168.7, 23169, 25577, 23173, 23148a, 23174, and 23908) plus the single French grammar (STC i4i25.5)—can have a random folio or two with all w 2 sorts and no telltale small w 2 sorts. Portions of these books, therefore, look like the Emmanuel fragment. By contrast, books with a normal concentration of English text—STC 17532, 922.4, 6830, 17541, 25422, and 1988.6—invariably have at least one small w 2 sort per printed folio, and often many more. Compared to the grammars, these English items are more clearly distinguishable from the fragment in question. Hence, if we disregard the grammars and focus on books purely in English, the only de Worde item in table 1 that exhibits all the typographical features of the Emmanuel fragment is STC 14109.5. Setting aside this unique coincidence (which I discuss in greater detail below), I conclude that our anonymous printer is almost certainly not Wynkyn de Worde but rather someone who used similar types. Elsewhere I have shown that the font in the Emmanuel College fragment exactly matches the textura used by Robert Copland after 22 March 1521 (STC 1386). 16 15. Sections of STC 15948 (4 Non. Aug. 1526) and STC 23244 (20 Oct. 1531) may have been set from this case as well, but the typographical evidence is equivocal. Table 1.

This font, used regularly until Copland's death around 1547, exists in several different states. After 1521, for example, the uppercase W-box was fouled with two large w 2 sorts; after 23july 1524 (STC 15050), the w-box had three small w 2 fouls. The large w 2 sorts recur periodically until the mid-1540s, but the small w 2 fouls were evidently purged around 1532. Owing to the small type sample, the Emmanuel fragment does not exhibit any of these low-density fouls, but otherwise the typographical details of the leaf conform precisely to those I have identified in Copland's corpus after March 1521. On the basis of the typography alone, therefore, I would attribute the Emmanuel fragment to Copland. Evidence confirming this attribution takes the form of the grotesque initial 'I' on sig. F2 r . Grotesque Initial. Citing the conclusions of Dennis E. Rhodes, Stubbings claimed that the woodcut initial 'I' on sig. F2 r of the Emmanuel College leaf appears in "several other de Worde books," including STC 1385, an edition of The fyfte eglog of Alexandre Barclay of the cytezen and vplondyshman [1518?]. 17 This remark, though partially true, is nevertheless broadly misleading. A cursory comparison of the grotesque 'I' in STC 1385 and the one in the Emmanuel College leaf reveals that the woodcuts are, in fact, entirely different. The grotesque in STC 1385 is a standard de Worde letter, documented in no fewer than twenty-one books printed at the Sign of the Sun between 1509 and 1530. 18 The initial in the Emmanuel fragment, by contrast, is attested in only two books bearing de Worde's colophon, both dated 1521: (1) The myrrour of the chyrche (STC 965, 1521 [before 22 April]) and (2) The passyon of our lorde (STC 14558, 6 Oct. 1521). After 1521, the Emmanuel grotesque is found almost always in books printed by Robert Copland and his heir William Copland (see appendix 1). 19 As I have argued elsewhere, the late appearance of this grotesque, coupled with other woodcut and typographical evidence, indicates that Copland likely printed STC 965 and STC 14558 for de 16.

Stubbings, "A New Manuscript," 331-332. Although Stubbings calls the figure a "woodpecker" (332), the iconographical details suggest that it is, in fact, a crane in its vigilance (with one leg raised, though not obviously holding a stone). 18. For the record, these books are STC 3547 (6 July 1509), 23876 (14 Sept. 1510), 7571 (6 Feb. 1512)10000.5 (1515) 22409 [c. 1516], 3547a (20 June 1517)5095 (1517) 21071 [1517?], 1385 [1518?], 10628 [1518?], 6833 (20 Nov. 1520), 10001 (1520), 23877 (8 Oct. 1521), 14083 (26 July I524), 3266 (7 Sept 1525), 966 (1527), 17974 (5 Nov. 1528) 22411 (24 Jan. 1528), 3267 (8 Feb. 1530), 14111 [c. 1530], and 17541 (1530). The same cut resurfaces in four books printed by John Wayland in 1537: STC 10495, 25413.5, 25414, and 25425.5. For a general introduction to the 23×20mm grotesques in sixteenth-century English books, see Joseph J. Gwara , "Dating Wynkyn de Worde's Devotional, Homiletic, and Other Texts, 1501-11," in Preaching the Word in Manuscript and Print in Late Medieval England : Essays in Honour of Susan Powell , ed. Martha W . Driver and Veronica O'Mara , Sermo 11 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013), 193–234, at 217–221. 19. The same initial also appears in STC 2078 (1549), a bible jointly printed by Thomas Raynald and William Hill . In this case, however, Hill borrowed the block from William Copland . I am grateful to Peter W. M. Blayney for drawing this fact to my attention (private correspondence, 11 May 2010). Worde, perhaps sharing the editions with him. 20 As Stubbings asserted, therefore, "other de Worde books" do exhibit the grotesque initial found in the Emmanuel fragment (though categorically not STC 1385), but only because they represent the unrecognized work of Robert Copland . The fact that Robert and William Copland used this cut for grotesque 'I' fairly regularly allows us to date the Emmanuel fragment with greater accuracy. As illustrated in appendix 1, this initial (I-2) exists in seven identifiable states which testify to the block's progressive deterioration from 1521 to c. 1550. In the Emmanuel fragment, the cut has the characteristic features of state d as found in STC 14563 (1529): (1) the long crack or scratch running vertically through the figure's crest, neck, and wing, and (2) the loss of the top line in the fifth triangle of the right serrated border. Consequently, the fragment must have been printed after STC 770 (7 Aug. 1528), in which the same initial is in state c. In addition, the right serrated border in the Emmanuel letter exhibits more wear than state d. In this regard, the block is somewhat closer to state e, documented in STC 5204.5, which is undated but which was most likely printed around 1542. This proposed date, though a few years earlier than the conjectural date of 1545 assigned by STC, is supported by two pieces of evidence. First, the state of the grotesque 'I' proves that STC 5204.5 was printed before STC 5732, whose grotesque—in state f, showing the loss of the upper serrated border—is noticeably less worn than state g, documented in three books printed by William Copland and William Hill around 1549. This coincidence leads me to deduce that STC 5732 was probably printed around 1545 and that STC 5204.5 preceded it by a few years. 21 Second, the publisher/bookseller Richard Kele (d. 1552), for whom Copland printed STC 5204.5, is first documented in the book trade in 1540 (STC I2206a.7). 22 The earliest books referencing the London address given on the title page of STC 5204.5 ("in the Powltry ... dwellyng at the longe shop under saynt Myldredes chyrche") date from c. 1542. 23 In all likelihood, STC 5204.5 belongs to the same period. 24 Hence, judging by the state of the grotesque, I conclude that the Emmanuel leaf was printed between 1529 and c. 1542, arguably in the mid-1530s. This date, as I shall now discuss, can be refined on the basis of textual evidence. Text and Dating. The identification of Le lugement d'amour as the source of the English text proves that Copland printed this book no earlier than 1530 and most likely in 1531 or 1533.

In 1991, he showed that the first edition was published in Paris by Jérôme Denis shortly after 14 September 1529, the date of the royal privilege on the title page verso (sig. a1 v ). 25 The printer, according to Kemp, was either Geofroy Tory or someone who used his types. This edition, furthermore, preceded the undated Paris edition of Antoine Bonnemère, which must have been printed after September 1530, when Bonnemère moved to the address referred to on the book's title page ("Au mont sainct Hylaire, a lhostel Dalbret"). 26 Kemp also demonstrated that the putative 1527 edition printed in Lyon by Olivier Arnoullet is a phantom, deriving from the misreading of the third "x" as "v" in the colophon date "Mil .ccccc.&amp;.xxxij" (sig. g4 v ). 27 In point of fact, the earliest Arnoullet edition bears the date 2 December i532, an indication that this edition was among the first to be printed legally after the expiration of the Denis privilege. In 2000, Kemp focused his attention on an anonymous and undated edition of Le lugement d'amour known in only two copies, one in the Bibliothèque Méjanes, Aix-en-Provence (C.6408), and the other in the British Library (G.10111). 28 He concluded that it was almost certainly a pirated edition printed in Caen about 1530 by the successors of Laurent Hostingue. In a later study, Kemp showed that the anonymous 1530 edition preserved in a single copy in the Musée Condé de Chantilly (IV, B.77) was printed in Lyon by Laurent Hyllaire . 29 The absence of a printer's name and place of publication indicates that this edition, too, was likely pirated. Both books show that printers outside Paris were willing (and able) to circumvent the three-year privilege granted to Denis in September 1529. 30 25.

The unique copy, which I have examined, is in the Edinburgh University Library (De.1/1.46). Kemp argued that the French translator was the lawyer Jehan Beaufilz , based on the motto "Plaisir fait viure" reportedly on the title page of the i533 Paris edition printed by Pierre Sergent and Pierre Leber (712-714). On the latter edition, see note 30. 26. Kemp, "La première édition," 711. Two copies of the Bonnemère edition have been reported: (1) Folger Shakespeare Library, PQ6390.F67 (cage), and (2) British Library, G.10112. I have examined both. Although Kemp does not say so, the reference to Bonnemère on the title page suggests that the book was printed after the Denis privilege had expired, perhaps as early as i532 -33.

In her critical edition, Finotti lists three additional sixteenth-century editions of Le lugement d'amour, but only one—that printed in Paris by Denis Janot in 1535—is publicly accessible: Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel, A: 591 Hist.(1). The others were sold by the Parisian book dealer and collector Pierre Berès in 2005 and 1995, respectively: (1) the 1533 Paris edition of Pierre Sergent and Pierre Leber ("On les vent a Paris a la rue neusue nostre dame a lenseigne sainct nicolas"), cited by Kemp (see note 25), and (2) a pirated edition of the 1529 Paris text bearing the name and address of Jérôme Denis but probably printed by Prigent Calvarin around 1531. For a full discussion of these books, see Finotti, ed., Jugement d'amour, 68–70, with an analysis and survey of all the extant editions on 48–71. In appendix 2 (section C), I edit Le Iugement d'amour based on the 1532 Arnoullet edition, listing in the Apparatus Criticus all variants, both accidental and substantive, from four of the six accessible sources. 31 This exercise confirms the conclusion reached by Boro that neither the Bonnemère nor the Caen edition could have been used as the basis of the Copland text. As Boro pointed out, line 39 in the Bonnemère version reads "ne sachant faire autre chose" (sig. E2 v ) as compared to "ne pouant faire aultre chose" in the other sources. 32 Of these two variant readings, only the latter would have generated the English "nat beynge of power to do any other thing." By the same token, the Caen edition prints "la grande malice" (sig. D4 v ) in line 40, whereas the other French editions have only "la malice." Since the English transmits "the malyce"—without the adjective "grete" or a similar qualifier—the Caen edition could not have served as the translator's source. 33 Similar evidence leads me to exclude the 1529 Tory-Denis edition, not consulted by Boro, as the source of the English translation. This edition prints "prudent &amp; discret" (sig. d5 r ) in lines 22-23, whereas all the other French sources have "discret &amp; prudent." The English phrasing "dyscrete and prudent" indicates that the translation could not have been based on the Tory-Denis text. Like the Caen edition, moreover, the 1535 Janot text has "la grande malice" in line 40, eliminating this edition as a source of the English. 34 The 1530 Hyllaire edition, by contrast, is a textual relative (or possibly a direct textual ancestor) of the 1532 Arnoullet edition, carrying most of its substantive variants. 35 A key piece of evidence points to one of these two editions as the source of the English translation—namely, the French "en dispute" in line 10, rendered in English as "in dysputacion." Since the singular noun in English hints at a singular noun in the French and since the Paris and Caen texts transmit either "en disputer" ('in disputing') or "en disputes" ('in disputations'), we can discount the three Paris editions and the Caen edition as sources of the English text. 36 Consequently, only the Lyon editions of 1530 and 2 December 1532 could have given rise to the stylistic idiosyncrasies of the English translation. 37 This conclusion leads me to propose 1530 as the terminus post quem for the English text. If we allow twelve months for (1) the export of either Lyon edition to England , (2) the preparation 31. I have been unable to consult the 1535 Janot and the 1530 Hyllaire editions.

Since the Arnoullet edition has unique errors not transmitted by the Hyllaire edition, additional textual evidence could allow us to pinpoint which of these two texts was used for the English translation. In theory, the recovery of other fragments from the lost Copland book could yield this kind of information. of the English translation, and (3) the printing of the book, then we can surmise that Copland could have printed his edition as early as 1531 (depending on the exact production date of the 1530 Hyllaire edition) or as late as 1533 (given that the Arnoullet edition is dated 2 December). Of these two dates, 1533 is more consistent with the state of the grotesque initial on sig. F2 r . Table 2.

Since the Emmanuel College leaf closely follows its French source, we can attempt to reconstruct Copland's lost Rose Garland edition. For his part, Rhodes speculated that the original English book was a quarto in fours with at least twenty-four leaves (4°: A–F 4 +). 38 On the basis of four surviving editions of Le Iugement d'amour, we can now posit a complete structure. As indicated in table 2, the text of Le Iugement d'amour has an estimated average of 21,349 words and a median of 21,281 words. Compared to the French passage, which has 505 words, the English has 597, a difference of 92 words amounting to 18.25 percent more material. Although we cannot be sure that the entire English translation was longer by the same factor, the literalness of the surviving text suggests a high degree of consistency in the translator's practice. Multiplying 21,349 and 21,281 (the average and median word counts of the French text) by 1.1825 and dividing by 597 (the number of English words in the Emmanuel College fragment) gives 42.29 and 42.15, respectively. Copland's book, therefore, likely had a minimum of forty-two leaves. In addition, the leaf signature F2 strongly suggests that the book was gathered in fours and had no illustrations. If we compare the Emmanuel passage to its source, we see that it appears almost exactly halfway through Flores's text. 39 In a quarto in fours, sig. F2 would correspond to f. 22, falling very close to the center of the book, just where we would expect to find it. In the other common structures for medium-length quartos of this period—sixes and alternating eights and fours—the same passage would appear on sig. F2 only if the book had been profusely illustrated. In a quarto in sixes, for example, sig. F2 would correspond to f. 32, meaning that ten folios would necessarily have been devoted to illustra- 38. Rhodes, "A Lost Romance," 463. 39. Table 2 shows that the French editions print most of the equivalent English passage on the following pages: (1) BCol. = 48-49 (midpoint = 52), (2) BL G.10111 = 54-55 (midpoint = 56), (3) Fo. PQ6390.F67 = 66-68 (midpoint = 72), (4) Edin. De.1/1.46 = 56-57 (midpoint = 60). tions. The situation is similar in a quarto in alternating eights and fours, in which sig. F2 would correspond to f. 34. For the Copland passage to fall on sig. F2, this structure would have required about twelve folios of illustrations. By way of comparison, the 1532–34 Wynkyn de Worde edition of Kynge Appolyn of Thyre (STC 708.5)—a quarto romance with fifty leaves gathered mostly in alternating eights and fours—has the equivalent of only six-and-a-half folios of illustrations preceding sig. F2 and nine folios in the entire volume. 40 Kynge Appolyn, moreover, had a comprehensive illustration scheme, with eighteen text-specific woodcuts, ten complementary cuts, and numerous factotums, all amounting to a comparatively high ratio of illustrations to text. 41 Hence, if Copland’s quarto had been gathered in sixes or alternating eights and fours, we would have to posit an unusually large number of illustrations, far beyond the norm in the most heavily illustrated books issued by a printer famous for his stock of woodcuts. Furthermore, Copland’s book was new to the English market. If Copland had wanted text-specific illustrations, he would have needed to commission them specially, thus greatly increasing his publication costs. Though not impossible, this kind of investment seems unlikely. By all appearances, then, the absence of illustrations from the Emmanuel College fragment is characteristic of the entire book, which probably had only a single title page illustration: a pair of factotums representing Affranio and Hortensia in disputation. 42 Allowing one leaf for the title page and another for a colophon and printer’s device, I conclude that Copland’s book was a quarto in fours with forty-four leaves, collating as follows: 4°: A–L 4 (44 ff.). This structure would make signature F the central gathering of the book, with the exact middle falling between sigs. F2 and F3. In Copland’s corpus, the closest model is STC 770, an edition of The secrete of secretes (7 Aug. 1528), a quarto in fours with thirty-six leaves, collating A–I 4 . The book from which the Emmanuel fragment derives, therefore, is one of the longest printed by Copland after 1525. Counting by edition sheets, it represents more than twenty percent of his surviving output between 1528 and 1532. 43 Conclusions. The literal translation of Le lugement d’amour suggests that the quarto’s original title was The Judgement of Love. Who was its anonymous translator? The deduction that Robert Copland printed the book makes him the leading candidate. During his apprenticeship with de Worde (evidently between 1505 and 1513), Copland translated several French works into English, cutting his teeth on at least two prose romances: The knyght of the swanne (6 Feb. 1512, STC 40. Bibliographers have not observed that most of STC 708.5 was printed in 1532–34, as indicated by its types and the state of its woodcuts. The inner sheet of gathering G, plus all of gatherings C and H (the latter with the colophon), are surplus sheets from an earlier edition, dated 28 February 1510. 41 Edward Hodnett , English Woodcuts 1480–1535, rev. ed. ( London : Bibliographical Society, 1973; orig. publ. 1935), Additions &amp; Corrections, 23–25 (nos. i090 a–r ). The book also incorporates Hodnett nos. 917, 930 (right half), 1090, 1093, 1095, 1104, 1111, 1193, 1241, and 1264 (Additions &amp; Corrections, 3). 42. The absence of illustrations is a feature that Copland likely carried over from his French source, perhaps intentionally. According to Kemp, by foregrounding vernacular style, the early Humanist printers in France allowed language to serve as its own ornament ("La première édition," 720–721). 43. Gwara, "Three Forms of w," 195. 7571 c. 15 22 , STC 7571.5) and Kynge Appolyn of Thyre ( 2 8 Feb. 1510, 1532–34; STC 708.5). Copland’s English translations of French verse also included three poems touching on relations between the sexes—the subject matter vividly dramatized in The Judgement of Love: (1) A complaynt of them that be to soone maryed (1535, STC 5729), (2) The complaynte of them that ben to late maryed (1506?, STC 5728; 1518?, StC 5728.5), and, possibly, (3) The fyftene Ioyes of maryage (1507–08?, STC 15257.5; 1509, STC 15258). 44 Copland continued to participate in the Tudor dialogue about gender roles (and especially the wiles of women) with three verse narratives of his own: (1) The seuen sorowes that women haue when theyr husbandes be deade (written c. 1526, earliest known edition c. 1565; STC 5734), (2) lyl of braintfords Testament (written c. 1535, earliest surviving editions c. 1563, STC 5731; c. 1567?, STC 5730), and (3) The hye way to the Spyttellhous (1545?, StC 5732). Although no stylistic idiosyncrasies link The Judgement of Love directly to Copland, the work’s genre and themes coincide with his interests as a translator and author. Several factors could explain Copland’s decision to translate and print The Judgement of Love in the early 1530s. Although works on gender issues were perennial favorites with English audiences, the period between 1530 and 1535 saw a particular increase in popular trifles about the nature of love and amorous relationships. 45 In addition to Copland’s contributions to the subject (STC 5729, doubtless accompanied by a lost 1535 edition of STC 5728), de Worde printed (or reprinted) titles like A contrauersye bytwene a louer and a Iaye (1532?, STC 10839), The payne and sorowe of euyll maryage (c. 1530, STC 19119), Chaucer’s The assemble of foules (24 Jan. 1530, STC 5092), Lydgate’s The Complaynte of a louers lyfe (1531?, STC 17014.7), William Walter’s The spectacle of louers (1533?, STC 25008) and his Guystarde and Sygysmonde (1532, STC 3183.5). All these works attest to a renewed interest in literature depicting the fraught relations between the sexes around 1530. No stretch of the imagination is required to think that this publishing program, at times serious and satirical, was a market response to King Henry’s Great Matter, which raised such issues as sexual desire, seduction, and wifely duty in the context of traditional marriage, religion, and royal politics. 46 The Judgement 44.

Mary Carpenter Erler (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1993), 43–48; Julia Boffey , " Wynkyn de Worde, Richard Pynson , and the English Printing of Texts Translated from French," in Vernacular Literature and Current Affairs in the Early Sixteenth Century: France, England and Scotland, ed.

Erler rejects the idea that Copland translated The fyftene Ioyes of maryage, calling the translation "anonymous" (110); Boffey, however, asserts that Copland was "probably" the translator (181). On the printing dates of these works, see Gwara, "Dating Wynkyn de Worde’s Devotional, Homiletic, and Other Texts, 1501–11," 209, 211, 230. 45.

On the resurgence of antifeminist literature in the early seventeenth century under James I—a debate in which late versions of Flores’s romance played an important part–see Joyce Boro , "Reading Juan de Flores’s Grisely Mirabella in Early Modern England ," in Renaissance Cultural Crossroads: Translation, Print and Culture in Britain, 1473 –1640, ed.

The Judgement of Love may also represent an early attempt to introduce English readers to the mannered or rhetorical style of discourse that became popular in England after c. 1540. 48 Associated with Spanish writers, this style radiated throughout continental Europe by way of Italian and French translations of Spanish works, most notably sentimental romances like The Judgement of Love. In this regard, Copland arguably stood at the forefront of the same Humanist enterprise as his French printer peers, offering English readers a model of elegant discourse in the vernacular. 49 Perhaps, too, The Judgement of Love was intended as an aid for learning foreign languages. Copland’s interest in printing French educational materials dates as far back as 22 March 1521, when he issued an edition of Alexander Barclay’s Introductory to wryte and to pronounce Frenche (STC 1386), the earliest French grammar printed in England. 50 Did Copland market his English translation of Le Iugement d’amour alongside imported copies of the original French source, expecting learners to improve their French skills by reading the texts side by side? The pairing of unilingual editions of Flores’s romance, intended to be consulted together, represents a logical intermediate step in the development of the parallel-column texts that future generations of European printers would issue in huge numbers. The pan-European circulation of Italian and French versions of Flores’s work meant that copies would have been readily available to any Englishman who wanted to learn either of these languages with the help of Copland’s translation. A consequence of the Emmanuel fragment discovery is the insight it offers into Copland’s post-1530 typography. As I have already mentioned, one item in de Worde’s corpus—STC 14109.5—appears to use the same font, a 95mm textura with s 3 , w 3 , and y 2 in the lower case and w 3 as a capital. Although this work, 47.

See Barry Taylor , "Learning Style from the Spaniards," 74–78. 49. The title page of the Caen edition of Le Iugement d’amour advertises the work as a vehicle for learning to speak elegant and sophisticated French: "¶Et par la dicte Hystoire vng chascun pourra aprendre et elegantement parler et a orner la langue Francoyse. Ainsi quon pourra veoir par la dicte Hystoire" ([A]ir). On this point, see also Kemp, "Une édition clandestine," 145 –149. 50. Robert Copland , Poems, ed. Erler, 67. a one-folio fragment (sig. a3) of An enterlude of temperance, is traditionally ascribed to de Worde, this attribution remains open to debate in the absence of corroborative evidence. Pending further study, therefore, I would tentatively ascribe STC 14109.5 to Copland on the basis of its typographical features. Admittedly, Robert Copland is not known to have printed interludes, but William Copland is credited with at least six: (1) The playe called the foure P (1560?, STC 13301), (2) An new enterlude of impacient pouerte newly imprynted (1561?, STC 14113), (3) A new enterlued for chyldren to playe named lack Iugeler (1562?, STC 14837; c. 1565?, STC 14837a), (4) An Enterlude of Welth, and Helth (1565?, STC 14110), (5) The Enterlude of Youth (1565?, STC 14112), and (6) An Enterlude called lusty Iuuentus (c. 1565, STC 25149.5). 51 This substantial corpus may reflect a long tradition of printing dramatic interludes at the sign of the Rose Garland , one that began with Robert Copland , whose only potential contribution to the genre may have remained unidentified without the new evidence of The Judgement of Love. The Emmanuel College fragment underscores the immense popularity—and profitability—of Juan de Flores’s sentimental romance outside Spain. Although bibliographers are unlikely to locate a complete copy of Copland’s lost edition, the recovery of additional fragments cannot be ruled out. The binding that once contained the Emmanuel fragment has been identified as the work of an anonymous London workshop active in the mid-1540s. 52 In theory, more bindings from the same shop could conceal additional fragments from the same lost Copland book. The inevitable decay of these bindings and the concomitant need for conservation may yield further evidence about The Judgement of Love and Copland’s attempt to market Flores’s celebrated Isabelline romance to Tudor readers. 53 51.

In The Stationers’ Company, 1:420–423, 2:1047–48, Blayney reassigns three interludes once attributed to William Copland to an anonymous London printer he calls "the printer of Smyth’s Envoy ": (1) [A play of love] (1548?, STC 13304), (2) Hycke scorner (1549?, STC 14040), and (3) The enterlude of Iohan the Euangelyst (c. 1550, STC 14643). The printer of a fourth play remains unknown: [Enterlude of somebody and others] (1551?, STC 14109.3). 52.

Basil Oldham , English Blind-Stamped Bindings, The Sandars Lectures 1949 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), 46, illustrated in plate XLI (no. 647). Oldham gives an approximate date of 1544 for this workshop’s period of activity, although the roll seems to have survived into the early seventeenth century. Philippa Marks , who kindly examined the Oldham rubbings on my behalf, informs me that only one other book exhibits this decoration: National Archives, E 336/27/1: Accounts rendered by John Rok (1544–45).

A number of my findings, including the discovery of Copland’s French source, were anticipated by Joyce Boro in her 2005 article.

APPENDIX 1 Grotesque ‘I’ In the Books of Robert Copland, William Copland , and William Hill , 1514 – 1550 The following catalogue is based on an examination of all the surviving output of Robert Copland and William Hill , plus all of William Copland’s output except STC 477.9 [1556] and STC 14837 [1562?]. Six items attributed to Robert Copland are also included: STC 17540 (1514), 14082 (16 May 1515), 17972 (5 May 1515), 965 (l521 before 22 April]), 14558 (6 Oct 1521), and 6835 [l523?]. On these attributions, see Gwara, "Three Forms of w," 149–167. A. Distribution of cuts for grotesque ‘I’ Robert Copland : 1514 – 1521: STC 17540 (1514), 14082 (16 May 1515), 17972 (5 May 1515), 965 (1521 [before 22 April]), 14558 (6 Oct. 1521). 1522 – 1530: STC 15206 (l522) 3123 [1523?] 6835 [1523?], 770 (7 Aug. 1528), 25421.2 (24 Dec 1528), 14563 (1529), 25421.3 (31 Oct. 1530). 1540s: STC 5204.5 [c 1542?], 5732 [l545?]. William Copland : STC 21043 [1549?], 2976 (13 May 1550), 19903 [c. 1550]. William Hill : STC 2078 (1549). B. Catalogue I-1 STC 17540 (1514), 17972 (5 May 1515), 14082 (l6 May 1515), 770 (7 Aug. I528), 25421.2 (24 Dec. 1528), 25421.3 (31 Oct. 1530); William Copland : STC 21043 [1549?L 2976 (l3 May 1550). This cut originally belonged to de Worde, who used it routinely between 1502 (STC 15376) and 14 September 1510 (STC 23876). After that time, it appears in only five "de Worde" books—the three that I have attributed to Copland plus STC 23877 (8 Oct. 1521) and STC 966 (1527). On Copland’s use of this initial, see Gwara, "Three Forms of w," 152–154, 166–167. I-2 STC 965 (1521 [before 22 April]), 14558 (6 Oct. 1521), 15206 (18 Nov. 1522), 770 (7 Aug. 1528), 14563 (1529), 5204.5 [c. 1542?], 5732 [l545?]; William Copland : STC 21043 [1549?], 19903 [c. 1550]; William Hill : STC 2078 (l549). Copland almost certainly acquired this cut around 1521. I have identified seven states: State a STC 965 (1521 [before 22 April]), 14558 (6 Oct. 1521). The outline below the wing of the figure (between the foot and wingtip) is intact. The lower line of the fourth triangle in the right serrated border is worn or broken off. (This wear suggests that the cut may have been used in a lost book printed before STC 965.) State b STC 15206 (18 Nov. 1522). The outline below the wing of the figure (between the foot and wingtip) has broken off. The apices of the triangles in the two serrated borders show minor wear. State c STC 770 (7 Aug. 1528). The apex of the far right triangle in the upper serrated border is badly worn or broken off. The outline across from the figure’s neck exhibits minor fracturing (not apparent in the illustration due to heavy inking). State d STC 14563 (1529). A vertical crack or scratch runs through the figure’s head (crest), neck, and wing; the outline of the neck has broken away. The upper line of the fifth triangle in the right serrated border has also broken off. State e STC 5204.5 [c. 1542?]. The apices of the triangles in both serrated borders show significant wear and/or breakage. The presence of this border proves that STC 5204.5 was printed before STC 5732. State f STC 5732 [1545?]. The upper serrated border and upper right corner of the block have broken off. The apices of the triangles in the right serrated border are badly worn. The state of the cut shows that STC 5732 was printed after STC 5204.5. State g STC 2078 (1549) 21043 [1549?L 19903 [c. 1550]. The right serrated border is badly worn; all but two of its triangle decorations are missing. I-3 STC 965 (l521 [before 22 April]), 3123 [1523?], 6835 [l523?]. This cut is documented in only three books, two of which Copland printed for others. A similar grotesque was used by de Worde, albeit infrequently, between 1506 (STC 12381) and 14 September 1510 (STC 23876). I-4 STC 15206 (18 Nov. 1522), 6835 [1523?], 25421.2 (24 Dec. 1528). Before passing to Copland, this cut belonged to de Worde, who used it routinely between 28 February 1510 (STC 708.5, sig. H1 r ) and 8 October 1521 (STC 23877). The differences in the appearance of the letter as documented in 1522 and 1528 may be due solely to the presswork. I-5 STC 15206 (18 Nov. 1522). This cut also belonged to de Worde, who used it between 4 September 1507 (STC 24878.3–8.5) and 8 October 1521 (STC 23877). It is not seen in English printing after 1522. C.

In the diplomatic edition (section A), I retain the original spelling, punctuation, hyphenation, and abbreviations; the Tyronian sign is represented by the ampersand. Line endings are indicated with double vertical rules; editorial reconstructions are enclosed within square brackets. The reading edition (section B) modernizes capitalization and punctuation, and silently expands abbreviations. In section C, I provide a diplomatic edition of the equivalent passage from Le Iugement d’amour based on the 1532 Lyon text, with variants from three other early editions: (i) Caen, c. 1530; (2) Paris, after 14 Sept. 1529; and (3) Paris, after Sept. 1530.

When John Dover Wilson collated Q 2 in the 1930s, only six of these seven exemplars were known (the Polish one was undiscovered), and with this new exemplar and an altogether more careful collation Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor have, for their Arden3 edition, added eight variants to the eighteen variants found by Wilson. 1 Thompson and Taylor's abbreviated labels for the exemplars (followed in this essay) are different from Wilson's, so for the sake of readers comparing their work the following mapping is given: Devonshire] = Huntington Library, so here HN Huth = Yale Elizabethan Club, so here Y 2 Folg[er] = Folger Library, so here F B[ritish] M[useum] = British Library, so here L Cap[ell] = Trinity College Library Cambridge, so here C 2 Grim[ston] = the earl of Verulam's exemplar at the Bodleian, so here VER Unknown to Wilson = University of Wroclaw, so here Wro Of the twenty-six variants, ten are clustered on the outer side of the book's final full sheet, N. The forme N(outer) exists in three states, listed in figure 1 according to which of the seven exemplars contains each combination of variants and with the supposed order of correction (established by Wilson) running down the page. Thus the uncorrected (or earliest-known) state is witnessed in exemplars F, HN, Y 2 , * I am grateful to Ian Gadd for his comments on an early version of this article, especially regarding its scope and the presentation of data, to John Jowett for discussion of the likely regularity in the work of compositors and pressmen, and to Mary Egan for explaining the mathematical procedures for statistical analysis of the raw data. Generous comments from the anonymous reader for Studies in Bibliography were most helpful in refining the article. My Research Assistant Nicola Boyle made the measurements on the Wroclaw exemplar of Q 2 Hamlet presented here and I measured the others. I would like to thank the librarians at Trinity College Cambridge, the Bodleian Library Oxford, the British Library London, Huntington Library San Marino, the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC , and the Beinecke Rare Book Library in New Haven for their kind offices in providing access to exemplars of Q 2 Hamlet, and the owners of the exemplars seen at the Bodleian Library (the earl of Verulam) and the Beinecke Library (the Yale Elizabethan Club) for permitting use of their books. 1.

FIGURE 1. The ten press variants on N(outer). Fredson Bowers's analysis of the reuse of headlines in skeleton formes showed that it is highly likely that Q 2 Hamlet was set by two compositors, each working almost exclusively on his own sheets and providing type to each of two presses. 2 Bowers presented his evidence using the post-war convention of assigning an upper-case roman numeral to each headline and listing the pages it topped ( figure 2 ), but the same data are here also presented using the conventions developed by Peter W. M. Blayney and G. Thomas Tanselle ( figure 3 ) that allow the patterns to be seen more clearly. In figure 3, boldface is used when one compositor lent the other a headline, which practice will be discussed in detail shortly. It is clear that four skeleton formes were set up, each containing four headlines (thus sixteen headlines, a-p). The skeletons were for the most part consistently used in two pairs, containing headlines a-h and i-p. The pair containing headlines a-h was used for sheets B, C, D, F and I and the pair containing headlines i-p was used for sheets E, G, H, K and L, while sheets M and N break this pattern. The half-sheet O was imposed and machined with half-sheet A, so that sheet O + A contributed three leaves to the book: the leaf conventionally designated A1 (presumably blank on both sides) is absent in all exemplars, the leaf conventionally designated A2 holds the title-page (with A2 v blank) and O1 r , O1 v , and O2 r hold the last three pages of the book (with O2 v blank). 3 Thus sheet O + A used only three running-titles: V=b for O1 r , XIV = j for O1 v , and XV = k for O2 r . Sheet O + A could not be incorporated into a regular pattern of headline reuse with the other sheets and for clarity it is omitted from further discussion. Within each pair of skeletons, one was for the most part consistently used for the outer and the other for the inner forme in sheets B-N. It is possible for one compositor working with one press to construct and use skeletons in this way, but there is no reason to do so and it would put him to unnecessary trouble. If we suppose two compositors and two presses, however, the skeletons would have provided a convenient orderliness to the processes of composition, imposition, and distribution. 2.

Since all we have is an unsigned leaf holding the title-page, calling it A2 is a bibliographic convenience and should not be taken to imply certainty that an Ai existed. FIGURE 2. The pattern of headline reuse discovered by Bowers. FIGURE 3. Bowers's pattern of headline reuse represented using the Blayney-Tanselle conventions. The advantage for one compositor of working with two skeletons is that it allows him to impose and lock up in the chase the forme next required by the press before the press has finished machining the current forme. John Russell Brown's examination of two distinctive spelling habits in Q 2 Hamlet corroborated Bowers's findings, 4 as did W. Craig Ferguson's discovery that two distinct roman typefaces are used in the book in the same pattern of divided labour suggested by Bowers's analysis of headline reuse and Brown's spelling analysis. 5 Adrian Weiss's scathing dismissal of Ferguson's book did not reject this 4. John Russell Brown , "The Compositors of Hamlet Q 2 and The Merchant of Venice," Studies in Bibliography 7 (1955), 17–40. 5. W. Craig Ferguson , Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England (Aldershot: Scolar Press, 1989), 15. discovery, and elsewhere he confirmed it. 6 Further confirmation was provided by Eric Rasmussen's analysis of the reappearance of distinctively damaged type throughout the book. 7 These studies all point the same way: two compositors using distinct sets of type divided the work, with one (compositor X) taking sheets B, C, D, F, I, and N and setting them in Lyon-a type using his own pair of skeleton formes, and the other (compositor Y) taking sheets E, G, H, K, L and M and setting them in Lyon-b type using his own pair of skeleton formes. None of this evidence can establish the order that the formes went through the press, since any arbitrary order is possible once we accept that printers often worked on several books at once rather than racing to complete each one before turning to the next, and that they did this to regulate the work-flow of the whole printshop. 8 However, the rational sequence of working alphabetically through the sheets of this book and maintaining a consistent pattern of alternating the sides (inner and outer) printed first makes the best sense of the evidence of type and headline reuse. The only alternative sequence that fits the evidence equally well is reverse alphabetical order, from the end of the book to the beginning. Working that way, printers might easily paint themselves into a corner, since in the event of miscalculation of the length of a book it is harder to extend the beginning than the end. Although extra leaves or gatherings could in principle be added anywhere in a book, Q 2 Hamlet has an unmovable head-title before the first lines of the play that was presumably intended from the outset. The trouble taken to make attractive beginnings to books suggests that publishers expected prospective buyers to examine them more closely than the ends. We may assume, then, an alphabetical progression of sheets and alternation of sides. This granted, the pattern of headline reuse might explain the clustering of variants, ten out of twenty-six, on a single forme, N(outer). Bowers showed that each compositor kept to his own eight headlines until near the end of the work. With the end in sight, compositor X imposed two of the pages of the outer forme of his last full sheet, N 3 r and N 4 v , using headlines i and j that he borrowed from compositor Y, who had used them on L 3 r and L 4 v . Similarly, compositor Y imposed two of the pages of the outer forme of his last full sheet, M 1 r and M 4 v , using headlines b and g that he borrowed from compositor X, who had used them on I 1 r and I 2 v . (The movements are shown in boldface in figure 3.) I have called this 'borrowing' on the assumption that the compositors worked simultaneously and swapped headlines. If the compositors were not working simultaneously, the pattern of headline reuse requires that to- 6. Adrian Weiss, "Review of W.

If the swapping of headlines by two compositors working simultaneously is accepted, it does not matter which of them did this first. The important point is that they invited trouble since they were in fact setting to slightly different measures. Fresh examination of all seven of the exemplars shows that the two compositors' sticks were not set to the same width. On pages where there are two or more lines set as prose, the width of the stick can be measured because type was justified by the insertion of spaces between words already set, or by changing spellings and abbreviations, rather than, as was done with verse, by adding spaces to the end of the line. Thirty-six pages of Q 2 Hamlet have such measurable passages, twelve of them set by compositor X and twenty-four by compositor Y. Appendix 1 shows the width of the stick (the measure) for each of these thirty-six pages in each of the seven exemplars. The readings fluctuate around 98 millimetres, but statistical analysis shows a small yet significant difference between their readings: compositor Y set his pages around 0.78 millimetres wider than compositor X. Necessarily the headlines varied by this amount too although they cannot be measured directly as they begin and end with spaces. When compositor X borrowed one of compositor Y's headlines, he ought to have either removed a thin space from this headline to match the page of type, or else added a thin spacing shim, a reglet, along a vertical edge of the page of type to widen it to match the headline. On compositor X's forme N(outer), the pages set with compositor Y's headlines are N 3 r and N 4 v . If we allow images of an impression taken from the forme (using the Huntington exemplar) to stand for the forme itself (with rotations and reflections as necessary), figure 4 represents how the type for N(outer) was imposed in what Wilson claimed is the uncorrected state as witnessed in the Folger, Huntington, Yale, and Wroclaw exemplars and figure 5 shows what an impression taken from that forme of type would look like. In both figures, highlighting shows the areas where type was adjusted to make the ten known corrections in the two later states: eight witnessed in the unique British Library exemplar and a further two corrections witnessed, together with those previous eight, in the Cambridge and Bodleian exemplars. The adjustments highlighted here include not only the altered readings, but also other type noticeably shifted in making them. Yet more type may have been temporarily disturbed to make these corrections but then reinserted into the forme in precisely its previous location and so not detectable from the printed books. 9 As can be seen from figure 4, the most extensive adjustment was made in the type just underneath headline i on N 3 r , one of the headlines borrowed from compositor Y and hence about 0.78mm too wide for compositor X's page of type. 9. The extent of type disturbance was established by laying upon a facsimile of one exemplar a transparency made from a facsimile of another exemplar, scaled so that undisturbed type was perfectly superimposed. This revealed absolute differences and by sliding the transparency left and right to find runs of type that could be aligned in the two images it was possible to see where such a run was moved to a new location as a single unit. The results were checked using downloaded digital images from the Shakespeare Quartos Archive website, which were rescaled, rotated, rendered opaque, and placed one upon another using the open-source GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) software. FIGURE 4. The imposed type for forme N(outer). FIGURE 5. Forme N(outer) as printed in exemplar HN. Whether the chases of early Jacobean printers had fixed crossbars, as later ones did, is not known; R. B. McKerrow guessed they had at least one. 10 Crossbars would confine the effects of imperfectly locked up type to within the space they enclosed (half a forme for one crossbar, one quarto page for two crossbars), whereas if moveable furniture did the work of crossbars then an oversize headline topping one page might affect other pages held in place by the same furniture. As well as N 3 r (which shows press corrections), the other page on this forme imposed with a borrowed headline is N 4 v —topped by headline j from L 4 v —and it shows no press corrections in the extant exemplars. The same problem of a mismatch between headline and type-page would have occurred when compositor Y borrowed compositor X's headlines: on M 1 r headline b from I 1 r was used, and on M 4 v headline g from I 2 v was used. In these cases, the headline would have been too narrow and any problem of looseness would be confined to the headline. There are no extant variants on these pages. The last two swaps were compositor X's imposition of N 4 r (a page showing one variant) using headline o from L 2 r and compositor Y's imposition of M 4 r (no extant variants) using headline h from N 1 r . The commonest type of accident in these circumstances is that loose sorts stick to the leather balls used to smear the ink onto the type and are thus lifted out of the press. The obvious remedy would be simply to reinsert the sorts back into the forme, unlocking the forme if necessary and tightening it more than usual to prevent recurrence of the problem. However it may be significant that compared to press correction elsewhere in the book, the changes on N(outer) are more extensive, more difficult to make, and largely lacking in obvious motivation. The preceding press corrections witnessed in the extant exemplars involved just one or two lines in the forme, the lines are always short (in the sense that there are spaces between the last word on the line and the end of the line), and the changes corrected literal errors of some importance. Typical examples are "Showe me the step and thorny way to heauen" becoming "Showe me the steepe and thorny way to heauen" (C 3 v ) and "Your Officres" becoming "Your Officers" (L 1 r ). Because of the spaces at the ends of the lines, the changes on the preceding formes were easily accommodated by increasing or decreasing that end-of-line spacing as needed and the disturbance of other words was minimal or avoided altogether. By contrast, seven of the ten corrections on forme N(outer) occurred in full lines, several required extensive alteration to the rest of the line, and one required alteration in four lines. For the sake of argument, let us consider these changes using Wilson's inferred order of correction of F, HN, Y 2 , Wro &gt; L &gt; C 2 , VER. On N 1 r the alteration thirtie &gt; thereby required that one or more spaces be removed from the end of the line and the three words after thereby (which is longer than the word it replaced) were shifted to the right. (In these descriptions, left and right refer in every case to the line as it looks to a reader of the completed book.) On the 10. Ronald B. McKerrow , An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927), 15n2. same page, pall &gt; fall was executed by inserting a thin space after the comma that follows this word, to take up the gap created because f is narrower than p . On N 2 v sellingly &gt; fellingly was executed with no discernible disturbance of type, but dosie &gt; dazzie required the reduction of the first, second, and fifth spaces in the line, and all the type between the first space and zz was shifted to the left. On the same page, the change of y to r and a space to a comma that turned yaw neither in &gt; raw neither, in left the line of type a little loose so a thin space was added after of later in the same line, and in executing too't &gt; doo't everything to the right of the d was shifted to the right after a space was removed from the end of the line. Still on N 2 v , the change reponsiue &gt; responsiue required the removal of a space before the preceding word, very , which was shifted left to accommodate the extra s. On N 3 r , the change of sir &gt; so sir required reduction of the spaces between the speech prefix and the first word of the line, between his and dugge and between the comma and thus later in the line so that the two words before so were shifted to the left and the type from so up to and including the comma was shifted right. The most extensive alterations were needed for be hangers &gt; be might hangers near the top of N 3 r , four lines below the too-wide headline i that compositor X borrowed from compositor Y. Earlier in this line the space between sides and its following comma was removed, and the following four words ( I would it be ) were shifted left to fill the gap created. But this made nothing like enough room for the word might to be inserted, so the last word on the line, then , and its following comma were moved to the second line, which line had then to lose the last six letters of its last word, assignes, plus its following comma, which were moved to the third line (the initial s of signes being changed to a long s because now heading a line), which had then to lose its last letters of bet a-, which were moved to the fourth line (the word-breaking hyphen being removed as no longer needed), where the adjustments could stop because the line was not full and spaces could be taken from its end. It is significant that in this adjustment of four lines, three runs of words seem to have been moved as unbroken units, for there is no sign of adjustment within them: "but on, six Barbry horses against six French swords their as", "and three liberall conceited carriages, that's the French", and "gainst the Danish, why is this all you call it?". As far as one can tell, the smaller units of type that had to be moved around these longer runs also underwent no internal readjustment, only repositioning as units. The resetting seems, then, to have involved the orderly removal or shifting along of small and large groups of sorts and their replacement in new positions. Thus if there was an accident of the press here, it did not involve the extensive pieing of type that may occur when furniture fails under pressure. Wilson's inferred order of correction of on N(outer)—F, HN, Y 2 , Wro &gt; L &gt; C 2 , VER—is one of only two possible orders, the other being its exact reverse: C 2 , VER &gt; L &gt; F, HN, Y 2 , Wro. No other orders are possible since the British Library exemplar (L) must represent the intermediate state. Were L to represent the earliest or the latest state then no matter which order we put the others in there would be a number of readings that were changed in the first round of correction only to be precisely undone in the second round. (The reader may see this by rearranging the rows in figure 1 above.) Such self-defeating inter- vention is most unlikely. In determining the order of correction, evidence from the meanings of the words is inconclusive. For all ten variants a case could be made for either of the two readings, since even the most unlikely word, reponsiue, could be defended as Hamlet's mocking coinage (from the French réponse meaning 'answer') prompted by Osric's ornamented description of the "French bet against the Danish" (N 3 1 ). Laertes wagers French rapiers and poniards that he brought back from Paris , from where his skill in fencing was, according to Claudius, reported to the Danish court by a visiting Norman gentleman called Lamord, much to Hamlet's envy (L 4 r -L 4 v ). Read in context, the other nine variants are either more-or-less poetically equivalent, such as pall/fall and too't/doo't, or only slightly weighted on one side, as with thereby being a trifle less awkward than the nonetheless acceptable (given appropriate punctuation) alternative of thirtie. FIGURE 6. The corrected-state readings dazzie and responsiue (from exemplar VER). Wilson's order of correction can, however, be confirmed by a couple of typographic anomalies. Figure 6 shows the N 2 v variants dazzie and responsiue from the Bodleian (VER) exemplar, showing that zz in the former and the first s in the latter are displaced vertically from the other letters in their respective words; the Cambridge exemplar (C 2 ) shows the same anomalies. These displaced letters were put into the forme during correction if Wilson is right, or were removed from it if the reverse order is correct. It is not unusual for letters inserted during correction to be somewhat misaligned with their neighbours, especially if correction is done on the bed of the press, as would be necessary if there were a problem of loose type. (On the imposing stone a comprehensive set of alterations could be made at leisure, resulting in more evenly aligned type, but carrying the forme from the press to the stone would risk disaster if type had loosened during machining.) If, however, Wilson is wrong and the Bodleian exemplar represents the earliest state of the forme, then in each of two rounds of correction (once for responsiue &gt; reponsiue and once for dazzie &gt; dosie) the letters chosen for adjustment happened to be those set somewhat higher than their neighbours. These displaced letters do not call attention to themselves by disfiguring the page, and it is unlikely that they received special attention purely by chance. Conclusion The coincidence of unusual clustering of stop-press corrections on one forme with a break in the pattern of headline reuse on that forme suggests a mechanical explanation for the extensive adjustment of N(outer). That the changes on this forme were relatively undermotivated and difficult to make (compared to those elsewhere in the book) gives further reason to suppose a mechanical explanation rather than to assume that the printers were unusually fussy at this point. The largest single alteration, involving resetting four lines of type on N 3 r , occurred where an oversized headline (likely to make the type underneath it loose) was borrowed, quite possibly for the first time in the job, from the other compositor. However, the alteration was extensive only because a whole word had to be inserted into a block of prose ( be hangers &gt; be might hangers ), necessitating the movement of type in four successive lines. This change was undermotivated since might was not essential to the line's meaning: the optative mood is already established by the phrasing I would it be hangers. The adjustment was in any case bungled, since be hangers &gt; might be hangers was clearly intended. This bungling might encourage scepticism about the accepted order of correction ( Wilson's order), making us wonder whether in fact the obviously incorrect reading be might hangers was the initial setting and during the run it was corrected to be hangers . The displaced letters in dazzie and responsiue, however, establish unequivocally the order of correction for the entire forme: Wilson was right. Figure 4 represents the forme of type as the compositor would see it, showing how easy it would be to insert a word in the wrong place because the type is a mirror image of the inked impression it makes. If, as I propose, the difference in widths in the two compositors' headlines caused this forme's peculiarities, the effects were not uniform: N 3 r and N 4 v were set beneath overlong headlines but only the former underwent stop-press correction, and N 2 v was set with a correctly-sized headline yet it also underwent correction. However, it would take only one significant accident in one part of the forme for the entire forme to receive attention, and if a large number of (not necessarily adjacent) sorts were progressively loosened during machining until they were plucked from the forme while it was being inked, then the compositor would probably be asked to check copy before reinserting them, since the potential for mistakes is great when multiple sorts are to be reinserted at once. As an explanation, such an accident would economically combine the known facts regarding the first round of stop-press correction: the compositors set to different measures, they swapped headlines when this forme was set, the forme contains an unusually large number of the book's variants—38% of the variants falling within just 4% of the book— and the alterations were relatively undermotivated (when judged purely on poetical grounds) yet difficult to carry out. Such an accident would preclude removing the forme to the imposing stone, and repair on the bed of the press (presumably under pressure of time) is consistent with the misalignment of the letters zz in dazzie in the first round of corrections. (The misalignment of the first s in responsiue was part of a subsequent round of stop-press correction— reponsiue &gt; responsiue and sellingly &gt; fellingly —that required so little disturbance of type that it could easily be achieved without removing the forme from the press.) If there was such an accident then the readings of the corrected state resulting from the first round of changes, witnessed uniquely in the British Library exemplar, have authority arising from the compositor's likely consultation of copy when recovering from it.

For each exemplar, we can think of the twelve readings for compositor X as a sample from a wider body of measurements that we could not take (because he set prose on only twelve pages) and this wider body of measurements would have a mean value that we do not know. We may treat compositor Y likewise, although we have a larger sample, twenty-four readings, from the wider body of measurements with an unknown mean. We are interested in the difference between the two unknown means, and can use the statistic called 'the difference in the sample means' to comment upon it. In Appendix One, the numerical means of the sample for each exemplar are given: this is simply the sum of the readings divided by the number of readings, twelve for compositor X and twenty-four for compositor Y. An expression of how widely or narrowly the readings are spread around the mean is called the 'standard deviation' (here SD). This is calculated by squaring each reading's difference from the mean, summing these squares and then dividing that sum by the number of readings, and finally taking the square root of this quotient. Once we have the standard deviations for the sample readings, these can be used to calculate a pair of numbers, a lower limit and an upper limit, for which we can say to an arbitrary level of confidence that the mean of the unknown distribution readings (that is, the actual width of compositor X or compositor Y's composing stick) falls within those limits. The lower the confidence level, the narrower the span between the lower and upper limits, and a typically useful value for the confidence level is 95%. The formulas giving the lower and upper limits for a confidence level of 95% are: Lower limit = Y mean – mean X mean – (1.96 × √ (Comp X's SD 2 /n + Comp Y's SD 2 /n)) Lower limit = Y mean – mean X mean + (1.96 × √ (Comp X's SD 2 /n + Comp Y's SD 2 /n)) where X mean is the average of the compositor X readings, Y mean is the average of the compositor Y readings and n is the number of readings in each man's sample. 11 This calculation is done for each exemplar separately. This statistic is included in Appendix One to demonstrate that to a reasonable level of confidence the differences in the readings are statistically significant rather than 'noise'. From it we can confidently say that compositor Y set his pages somewhere between half a millimetre and one millimetre wider than compositor X, with the likeliest difference being around three-quarters of the millimetre. 11. These equations assume what is called a normal distribution, meaning that the readings fit a characteristic profile for differences from the unknown mean. Because of the small sample sizes available here (twelve and twenty-four readings) there is an argument for instead assuming what is called Student's t-distribution. However, in this case such an assumption makes negligible difference to the overall result. Although each exemplar has a different storage and handling history that might affect its absolute readings (which cannot therefore be combined across exemplars), these histories ought not to affect one compositor's pages more than the other's within each exemplar. The raw data vary around the means because each sheet of hand-made paper would have absorbed a different amount of water when wetted for printing, would have shrunk by a different amount when dried (and during storage over the ensuing centuries in different locations), and because the depth of ink applied before each pull would vary, as would the pressure exerted by each pull and hence the depth that the type bit into the paper. Also, there is human error in measuring by eye. The readings were taken by placing a measuring rule on the page to press it flat and recording the full distance from the first sign of ink in the first letter of the line to the last sign of ink in the last letter on the line, ignoring where necessary letters with kerns extending beyond the body of the type. Where different lines on a page produced different readings, the readings for the page were averaged. The Huntington exemplar's values for both compositors are consistently higher (by about half a millimetre) than the others, which might reflect a permanent expansion upon washing (and subsequent pressing); it is the only exemplar whose leaves have been inlaid, which operation is not infrequently accompanied by washing. BEYOND FURBANK AND OWENS: A NEW CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THE "DEFOE" CANON by Ashley Marshall As long as Defoe lived and wrote, he whistled many of his favourite airs. And if his friends would take the trouble to listen to them, he might ... be almost entirely preserved. John Robert Moore It was ... Defoe's common practice to conceal his authorship. It is the task of the student of Defoe to discover it. &gt; John Robert Moore ... your Ldpp will perceive I have Disguised the Stile, and I am perswaded no body will so much as guess it is mine. Daniel Defoe 1 THE radical reduction in the Defoe canon proposed by P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens has put Defovians in a variety of states ranging from acceptance, to doubt and consternation, to fury and denial. In 1988, Furbank and Owens published The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe , 2 challenging the soundness of the 570–item canon laid out in John Robert Moore's A Checklist of the Writings of Daniel Defoe . 3 In doing so, they confronted a problem that some scholars had worried about but none had ever really tried to reckon with. The sheer quantity was startling: could even a very industrious man have written so much, so fast, and for so many years? Yet more disturbing was the fact that many of the works in Moore's canon were there simply because they "sounded like" or seemed "characteristic of" Defoe and no scholar had proven that they were by anyone else. Surveying the history of the growth of the canon, Furbank and Owens delivered a polite but blunt message: attributions should no longer be made from style and content alone, and serious reconsiderations were in order. Six years later they brought out Defoe De–Attributions: A Critique of J. R. Moore's Checklist, objecting even more forcefully to Moore's principles of attribution and arguing for the removal of 252 works. 4 In 1998, they published A Critical Bibliography of Daniel Defoe , setting forth their revised canon comprising 276 items, divided into "certain" and "probable." 5 1. Moore , "The Canon of Defoe's Writings," The Library, 5th ser., 11 (1956): 155–169, at 169, 163. The third epigraph is from a letter from Defoe to Godolphin (29 June 1708), printed in W. R. Owens and P. N. Furbank , "Defoe as Secret Agent: Three Unpublished Letters," The Scriblerian 25 (1993): 145–53, at 150. 2. New Haven : Yale University Press, 1988. 3. 1960; 2nd ed., Hamden , CT: Archon, 1971. 4. London : The Hambledon Press, 1994. 5. London : Pickering &amp; Chatto, 1998. Some scholars have naturally resisted the proposed reduction, but a surprising number of the published responses to Furbank and Owens's three books were essentially positive. Reviewers have pointed out minor inconsistencies or omissions, and critics have objected to the removal of this pamphlet or that one, but several established scholars in the field expressed relief at having Moore's monster canon called into question. Reviewing Defoe De–Attributions, J. Paul Hunter lamented that "It is nothing less than a professional scandal that it has taken a full century to approach the Defoe Bubble with a pointed argument." Whether or not we agree with particular judgments made by Furbank and Owens , he continued, they "have done important professional service in making us face the attribution issue with more than hunches and knacks." 6 That the bloated canon enshrined in Moore's Checklist must be abandoned is generally conceded. The question that now needs to be addressed is whether the Furbank and Owens Critical Bibliography gives us a solid foundation on which to base future criticism and scholarship. Few people want to worry about evidence in attribution, and many students of Defoe seem to take the view that as of 1998 we are working from a rock–bottom, minimal canon that will probably expand a bit over time. They assume that, if the loudest advocates of conservative attribution include a work, then we can safely regard it as at least "probably" Defoe's . I want to suggest that this is a dangerous kind of false confidence. If one actually examines the attributional evidence for the reduced canon, one quickly discovers that in a startling number of cases the proof of authorship is far from definitive, and in all too many it is worryingly dodgy. We need to take a hard look at the nature of the evidence and make some vital distinctions. My object is neither to de–attribute what Furbank and Owens include nor to re–attribute what they exclude from the canon. Rather, I want to try to develop what they have given us. The first word in my title is precisely what is meant—not "contra" in any sense, but beyond Furbank and Owens . In what follows I do critique their apparent inconsistencies, but only in order to build a more refined and subtle version of the Bibliography they have provided. My aim is to put forward an alternative representation of their results in a format designed to communicate more clearly the realities of the "Defoe" canon—to sensitize us to the nature and solidity (or lack of same) of the evidence we currently have. Furbank and Owens offer three possible verdicts: definite, probable, and de–attributed. I want to demonstrate that in quite a lot of particular cases a more nuanced and tentative judgment is as far as the evidence can carry us. 1. The Logic of the Furbank and Owens Canon When Furbank and Owens decided to tackle the problem of Defoe's canon, they inherited a mess. From George Chalmers (1790) to Moore , bibliographer after bibliographer had wished to add works, often without any good basis for doing so. Moore in particular was motivated by an impulse to attribute new titles and by enormous faith in his ability to hear Defoe's voice in anonymous texts. Many scholars accepted his attributions without doubt or demur, glad to 6. Eighteenth-Century Fiction 8 (1996): 310–312, at 312. have additional grist for their mill, though Moore almost never explained why he thought a work was by Defoe . 7 Furbank and Owens were "outsiders" rather than established Defovians; they had no personal stake in any of the works and no special desire to credit Defoe with everything he might imaginably have written. They pressed us to come to each work from scratch and with no commitment to a positive result—clearly the only sound way to proceed, especially in a case as muddled and uncertain as Defoe's . Their object was to arrive at a more defensible canon. Before turning to the question ofjust how solid what we are left with is, we need first to ask how they established the canon they proposed. What is their methodology, how do they weight evidence, and exactly where do their conclusions come from in each case? Furbank and Owens stress "three fundamental rules" that need to be followed in attribution. The first is that one cannot "base any part of one's argument on some other merely probable attribution." In other words, parallels drawn from works tentatively assigned to Defoe are not admissible. Their second stipulation is simply that one should not add a work to the canon without explaining why one is doing so—an obvious desideratum, but one whose importance any user of Moore's Checklist will understand. The third principle is in some ways the most vital: plausibility alone is not enough. A piece dealing with a subject Defoe is known to have been concerned about and written in a style not incompatible with his should not be added to the canon solely on that basis. A corollary to that principle is that a work should not be admitted "provisionally" (i.e., "until some better candidate for authorship appears"). 8 The key question, for my purposes, is what constitutes evidence. On what grounds do Furbank and Owens include a work, or remove it, or label it merely "probable"? The great problem in Defoe studies from Chalmers to Moore has been excessive reliance on internal, and especially stylistic, evidence—meaning thematic parallels with other known writings, similar uses of language, or an idiosyncratic line of argumentation. Furbank and Owens are rightly suspicious of "favourite phrases," which count for almost nothing in their Bibliography. They 7. Samuel Schoenbaum's scathing critique of attribution studies as of the mid–1960s seems painfully relevant here: "attribution studies frequently offer little or nothing in the way of description or defense of the methods employed. In some cases apparently no thought has been given to methodology, or so one would conclude from the cavalier violations of ordinary principles of logical procedure." The "vague standard of doing 'the best one can', offered instead," he continues, "may seem inadequate to the conscientious student faced with the frustrating complexities of a canon." See Internal Evidence and Elizabethan Dramatic Authorship: An Essay in Literary History and Method ( Evanston : Northwestern University Press, 1966), 162–163. In the same year appeared Evidence for Authorship: Essays on Problems of Attribution, ed. David V. Erdman and Ephim G. Fogel ( Ithaca : Cornell University Press, 1966), comprising thirty-one old and new essays plus a bibliography of more than a hundred pages. Evidence for Authorship opens with Arthur Sherbo's "The Uses and Abuses of Internal Evidence," a ringing endorsement of attribution from parallels in style and content of the sort that (we now discover) underlie a very large number of items in the Defoe canon, even the reduced canon of Furbank and Owens . If Defovians had evaluated Moore's attributions in the light of the eight criteria proposed by Schoenbaum , or had taken on board Fogel's "Salmons in Both, or Some Caveats for Canonical Scholars" (chap. 4 of Evidence for Authorship), a vigorous rebuttal of Sherbo, the Defoe bubble would have been popped just as the boom in criticism of his "novels" was getting under way. 8. These rules are listed at Critical Bibliography (hereafter CB), xxv. do pay some attention "to favourite allusions (anecdotes, historical references, legendary stories and the like) and also to favourite quotations," as these seem more likely to be unique markers (xxvii). For Furbank and Owens , the crucial point is that internal evidence can substantiate (or undermine) an attribution—but will not suffice by itself. Content and style can help us determine plausibility or implausibility, but they supply nothing probative. For an item to be treated as definitively Defoe's , therefore, Furbank and Owens demand at least a scrap of external evidence. External evidence takes the form, they say, of "contemporary witness "—by which they mean "a contemporary affirmation as to a work's authorship, whether by a known person or otherwise." They "extend the term 'contemporary' to include a posthumous attribution to Defoe during the years in which he was still a living memory," and define those years as "any time before the publication of Chalmers's 'List of Writings' of 1790" (xxvi). Why sixty years (rather than twenty or forty or ninety) they do not explain, but for them an attribution to Defoe made before the end of 1789 counts as legitimate external evidence. Like stylistic evidence, "contemporary" attribution is suggestive rather than probative: if an unreliable or unknown source assigns a work to Defoe that seems to be totally un-Defovian, then for them the attribution does not stand. They weight external evidence much more heavily than internal, in other words, but they are prepared to reject an eighteenth-century attribution on the basis of a work's content. Furbank and Owens's assessment of the internal and external evidence leads them to sort works into three categories— certain attributions, probable attributions, and de-attributions. For an item to be labeled "certain," they require one piece of external evidence plus stylistic/thematic plausibility. "Probable" works are supported by more than one piece of internal evidence or by a possible but unproven piece of external evidence (e.g., "this might be the pamphlet Defoe refers to in a letter"). Furbank and Owens de-attribute items for which (from their point of view): (a) there is only slight and speculative internal evidence and nothing external; or (b) there is external evidence negated by the implausibility of the style or content. Items belonging to the third category—out of the canon—are listed in their Defoe De-Attributions volume. 9 The Critical Bibliography includes the remaining 276 items, divided into certain and probable (the latter labeled "P"). 2. Practical and Conceptual Issues The methodology adopted by Furbank and Owens is obviously vastly more conservative than those employed by earlier Defoe bibliographers, and their conservatism is a good thing. But, as some reviewers have noticed, there is a significant problem with Furbank and Owens's attributional policies, as well as a variety of inconsistencies in the execution of those policies. I want here briefly 9. There are five exceptions, works which appear in both Defoe De-Attributions and the Bibliography. About two de-attributions, Furbank and Owens explain, "we have now found reason somewhat to modify our opinion, and as regards three other works, though we feel unable to include them ... it seems wrong to us to pass them over in silence. Thus we discuss them in a separate section ... under the heading 'Unresolved problems in attribution'" (CB, xxviii). The two de-attributions that Furbank and Owens decided to restore—at least to "probable" status—are 188(P) and 193(P). to survey a few of these issues, because understanding them is important to making further progress in the realm of Defoe bibliography. In section 3, I will turn to what seems to be the most crucial point: the Critical Bibliography presents the canon shorn of its most obviously implausible or illogical attributions, but its firm demarcations obscure important gradations. What a tabular representation can do beyond that is to make clear the distinctions among the different kinds of evidence (and different degrees of probability) on which the reduced canon is based. The necessity of doing this is a point to which we will return. First, the one serious reservation about Furbank and Owens's policy on evidence. What they have to say about internal evidence is essentially sound, but their notion of external evidence is disconcerting. 10 Any attribution made before 1790 is deemed "contemporary"—a loose definition of contemporaneity. (By this standard, James Joyce [d. 1941] would have been a living memory as late as the year 2000.) That some posthumous references should be considered valid is clear; in the 1730s, and possibly in the 1740s, Defoe was still very much a "living memory." There is no inherently right cutoff date. But why not stop at (say) the list of writings included in the 1753 Shiels/Cibber "life" of Defoe? Not much is attributed for the first time to Defoe in the years between 1753 and the mid-1770s, by which point we are nearly half a century beyond his death. Why did Furbank and Owens extend their notion of "contemporary" to include the 1770s and 1780s? Probably this was not an arbitrary decision, but one having to do with the fact that the only external evidence we have for linking Defoe to most of his "novels" dates from the years between 1775 and 1787. Of the fiction only Robinson Crusoe, Col. Jacque, and A Journal of a Plague Year had been publicly attributed to him as of 1753. The situation remained essentially unchanged for another twenty years. Captain Singleton is advertised as Defoe's in 1767, 11 and in the 1770s and 1780s, a rogue bookseller named Francis Noble assigned to Defoe mangled versions of Moll Flanders and Roxana, as well as Memoirs of a Cavalier (the last mostly faithful to the original). After someone else credited Defoe with A New Voyage in 1786, Noble promptly issued a three-volume edition of that work under Defoe's name. I have discussed Noble and his connection to Defoe's fiction at length elsewhere. 12 At the moment what matters is that Noble is all the external evidence we have for attributing two thirds of " Defoe's " most important fiction to him. Concerns about what constitutes contemporaneity in external evidence notwithstanding, we need to ask just how consistently Furbank and Owens apply the criteria they promulgated for attribution. The answer is less reliably than one might hope, though in fairness one must admit that the nature and scope of the 10. Some reviewers of the Critical Bibliography have pointed this out. See Tom Keymer , The Review of English Studies, n.s., 50 (1999): 533–536, at 535; and G. A. Starr , Eighteenth-Century Fiction 12 (2000): 584-589. Starr justly complained that Furbank and Owens "may have good grounds for believing that [ Defoe's ] 'living memory' survived for sixty years, rather than thirty or ninety, but they do not give them" (587). 11. Noble associates Defoe with Captain Singleton again in his 1784 edition of Memoirs of a Cavalier. The 1767 advertisement is in The London Chronicle for 23–25 June. 12. Marshall , "Did Defoe Write Moll Flanders and Roxana?", Philological Quarterly 89 (2010): 209–241 Details on these attributions are provided in the table below. See also Furbank and Owens , "Defoe and Francis Noble," Eighteenth-Century Fiction 4 (1992): 301–313. material make perfect consistency impossible. Furbank and Owens admit that external evidence is not necessarily proof of anything, which is why they retain some of the items attributed to Defoe by Abel Boyer and Robert Wodrow , for example, while excluding others. 13 Edmund Curll , we are told in De-Attributions, is not a sufficiently reliable source. Wodrow is likewise untrustworthy, because his "methods of reasoning" are faulty: he lumps groups of works together and assigns them to Defoe for no reason except that each refers to the others. 14 About the unreliability of those sources Furbank and Owens are entirely correct—but we might compare the treatment of De-Attributions no. 130 to the Critical Bibliography entries on Moll and Roxana. No. 130 is The State of the Excise after the Union, about which Furbank and Owens have this to say: "Given the date of Wodrow's ascriptions ... they must count as external evidence." They are, however, "inclined" to doubt the attribution. Of Moll and Roxana, they conclude, "The attribution by Noble is evidently questionable, but given its date it must count as external evidence" (CB, 200). In the one case, the unreliability of the source overturns an otherwise plausible attribution. In the other, the unreliability of the source is trumped by their sense of the plausibility (or perhaps the desirability?) of the attribution. The State of the Excise after the Union should not be re-attributed on current evidence, but by the standards of the Critical Bibliography it seems more aptly described as "probable." Alternatively (and more safely), unreliable "contemporary" attributors might simply be disregarded—meaning that the canon shrinks yet further, and we lose Moll and Roxana. The fact that Furbank and Owens find some "contemporary" sources more reliable than others is itself unobjectionable. What is unclear, however, is why Noble's testimony (for instance) is more inherently reliable than Wodrow's or Curll's. The evaluation of internal evidence is likewise sometimes disquieting. Several items in the De-Attributions volume are removed from the canon because one piece of stylistic evidence is in itself inadequate. For example: "Defoe was unquestionably fond of this anecdote, but on its own ..." (no. 324a), they say, and no. 334 includes a remark that is "very close to a line" from The Mock Mourners, but "the allusion, if it is one, could admit of various explanations." 15 That one suggestive internal tidbit does not constitute a sufficient basis for attribution seems a sound conclusion. But several works labeled "probable" in the Critical 13. For discussion of the Boyer and Wodrow attributions, see Defoe De-Attributions, xiv-xvii. In the Political State for June 1717, Boyer attributed fourteen works to Defoe; Moore retained twelve of those in his Checklist; Furbank and Owens include seven in their Bibliography. Wodrow died in 1734. His attributions were not public, but were handwritten on his private collection of pamphlets. Eight works, Furbank and Owens explain, "may be described as first-time attributions ... in the sense that, by writing 'By Dan. De Foe' or some such phrase on his copies, he was the earliest person to associate them with Defoe" (xvi). Moore included all eight in his Checklist; Furbank and Owens admit only two (nos. 85 and 89(P)). 14. Defoe De-Attributions, 27. Here they are concurring with J. A. Downie , "Defoe and The Advantages of Scotland by an Incorporate Union with England : An Attribution Reviewed," PBSA 71 (1977): 489-493. 15. In another case, they explain that the first bibliographer to make an attribution must have been "merely influenced by the various quotations from and references to works by, or ascribed to, Defoe"—an influence they themselves sometimes seem under as well. See Defoe De-Attributions, 115 (item no. 401). Bibliography are included on the grounds that they have at least two suggestive internal tidbits, each of which could presumably "admit of various explanations." If one allusion is not enough and a single close quotation is not enough, then do we really want to accept a work because it has one of each? At some point an accumulation of suggestive tidbits might perhaps seem persuasive, but where we have two or three and no reliable corroborating outside source, just how solid is the attribution? Alternative explanations need to be considered, as in the case of A New Test of the Sence of the Nation (112(P))—regarded as "probable" because two of its passages echo one issue of the Review. But the Review did have readers, some of them also writers, who might well have been influenced by its argumentation and rhetoric. More broadly, the evidence for including a work as "probable" in the Critical Bibliography is occasionally similar to the evidence that is ruled inadequate in De-Attributions; an allusion or discussion or quotation might render a work "probable" or it might not. Furbank and Owens rightly argue that each case must be evaluated on its own merits, which means arriving at different conclusions for cases with differing mixes of evidence—but in each instance the calculus that yields the result needs to be laid out in full for the reader. Part of Furbank and Owens's procedure is to ask whether a work for which we have external evidence of Defoe's is a plausible attribution. Broadly speaking, this is a sensible policy. We want to know whether something ascribed to Defoe by a contemporary could have been written by him. One obvious problem with trying to determine Defovianness is that the works we can be certain he wrote are relatively few in number, and many of them date from early in his career. A second problem is that we need to allow for fits of temper and changes of mind. A work that does not square with what Defoe said elsewhere is not necessarily an implausible attribution. To say that Defoe "sometimes wrote badly, but ... was not capable of certain kinds of badness, as of certain kinds of excellence" is problematic. 16 Highly skilled and competent people have bad days. Given all the uncertainties surrounding Defoe, "assume nothing" is probably a good guideline for proceeding. A core principle for Furbank and Owens is that one should never make a new attribution without explaining one's reasons. But if one is undertaking a drastic reconsideration of the old canon, then one ought to take the opportunity to provide reasons for the retention of every item. For most of the "novels," no such case is made. We are duly told about Gildon's attribution of Crusoe to Defoe. The sequels, Farther Adventures and Serious Reflections, are presumably in the Critical Bibliography because Defoe scholars seem always to have assumed that the author of the first part is necessarily the author of what follows. 17 This is not the place to test that presumption, but the point is that Furbank and Owens did not explain the nature of the evidence that justified the preservation of the sequels in the "definite" category. Unfortunately, the same could be said of Captain Singleton, Moll Flanders, A Journal of the Plague Year, Col. Jacque, Roxana, and A New Voyage. The only significant work of fiction (other than Crusoe) for which Furbank and Owens give anything beyond the shaky external evidence is Memoirs of a Cavalier, 16. Defoe De-Attributions, xxxiii. 17. Furbank and Owens do not point out that Gildon attributes Farther Adventures (though not, of course, Serious Reflections ) to Defoe in 1719; see the note to item 204 in the appendix below. first attributed to Defoe by Noble in 1784. The additional substantiation consists of three facts: on several occasions Defoe claimed "to have in his possession a manuscript by an English gentleman who served under Gustavus Adolphus"; a reference in Memoirs is "reminiscent" of a passage in the Review for 15 July 1704 (that is, sixteen years earlier); and in general the "overall plan of the work ... strikes one as very Defoean" (194). The case for inclusion is not exactly compelling, though it is more than what we are told about Moll, Roxana, and some others. We should also be aware of the fact that, though the evidence for Memoirs of a Cavalier, Moll Flanders, Roxana, and Captain Singleton is functionally identical, only the first is downgraded to "probable." That they shrink from attaching the dreaded "P" to two of the three principal novels is understandable—but if one is going to trust Noble, then one really has to trust him. We need to be applying the same criteria (at least where the source is the same) regardless of how canonical the item in question is. At this point I want to move beyond the particularities of inconsistencies and oddities, and to consider the broader utility of the Critical Bibliography. What Furbank and Owens have accomplished in this and in their two previous books is phenomenal. They have effected a radical reduction of a much-cherished but much-swollen canon. What they did needed to be done, and if scholars do finally commit themselves to a smaller canon more scrupulously justified, that will be thanks largely to Furbank and Owens's pioneering efforts. The question is not whether their Bibliography has value—it is extremely valuable—but what we can (and cannot) safely use it for, and how it can be improved upon. Let us remember the big picture. Almost all of the items Moore attributed to Defoe were published anonymously. In a huge number of cases, therefore, we have to depend upon something other than self-identification for the attribution. Furbank and Owens wisely insist upon external rather than internal evidence if a work is to be considered "certain," but extrinsic evidence varies wildly in quality, and most of it is proof of nothing. For that reason, they test contemporary attribution against content and style—also reasonable, though we need to remember that the apparent plausibility of subject and approach is likewise far from probative. In the Critical Bibliography, Furbank and Owens confer "certainty" and "probability" for a variety of reasons, arriving at their verdict by weighing different kinds of evidence, and then sort everything into only two categories. This division into "definite" and "likely" is potentially misleading. An item that is ascribed to Defoe by an enemy in his lifetime and that is stylistically plausible, Furbank and Owens label "certain"—but such an item is nothing like as certain as those of which he unambiguously acknowledged authorship. What we need are more categories—that is point one. But we should remember that these categories cannot really reflect degrees of probability. What I am suggesting, in other words, is not that we re-categorize works into "definite," "highly probable," "somewhat probable," "slightly less probable," and so on. We need a layout and set of groupings that make clear the nature of the attributional evidence, but to assume that we can calculate the percentage of probability is foolish and dangerous. We can take the nature of the dubiety into account, but not the degree. For example, we can distinguish between an antagonistic or disreputable source and a sympathetic and reputable one. If the sainted Jacob Tonson had published something as Defoe's , we might be inclined to treat the ascription as reliable external evidence; if the sleazy Edmund Curll made the same attribution, we would be much more skeptical. We cannot afford not to distinguish among degrees of probability—but neither can we sanely pretend that the differences are measurable. Tonson could be wrong and Curll could be right. A similar limitation applies to internal evidence. A work that has a dozen parallels to Defoe's known writings might not be his, and one with only a single parallel might be. How does one compare three weak pieces of stylistic "evidence" as against one more potent piece? We can say that a particular attribution is based on "x" and "y." What we cannot do is add "x" and "y" and arrive at a verdict of ten per cent probable or ninety per cent probable. The problem we are dealing with here is twofold. First, we have no way of judging how likely most of the attributions are. Rogue booksellers and malicious rivals are not ideal sources, misinformation abounds, several items were attributed to Defoe but also to someone else, and Defoe's denials of authorship are surely sometimes but probably not always disingenuous. This is unfortunate, frustrating, and unfixable. The evidence is the evidence. The second problem is one we can address and it will be the subject of the next section. 3. The Evidentiary Basis of the Furbank and Owens Canon Invaluable though the Bibliography is, its structure and layout necessarily make the radical differences in the quality of the attributional evidence hard to appreciate. Users cannot easily see just how many of the items included are anything but solid and secure. In the appendix I have tried to provide a short-form representation of the entire Furbank and Owens canon, abandoning the "certain" and "probable" division and re-categorizing works according to the nature of the evidence we have for associating them with Defoe. The tabular form of the appendix is an attempt to represent the reduced canon in ways that make explicit, item by item, what the basis for inclusion actually is. This table is not a revision but an extension of Furbank and Owens's work: it is meant to represent their Bibliography in a way that should help us more readily grasp the complexities and limitations of the evidence on which it is based. In the next section I will try to offer some analytic conclusions, but first we need to understand exactly what we are dealing with. Let me reiterate an important point: my object is not to determine the authorship of these works. I have supplied additional evidence when I have become aware of it, but mostly the table is meant to illustrate their canon and its foundation. The aim is to make plain how many different kinds of evidence are at issue. I want both to clarify the nature of the basis for attribution in each case and to represent vividly in visual terms just how much of the Furbank and Owens canon comes from each sort of evidence. The evidence for initial acceptance of a title into the Bibliography falls into six categories. The shorthand category names are listed here with brief explanations of what each one includes. Claimed by Defoe . This includes items published in authorized collections, as well as those acknowledged by name in letters, in the Review, or in An Appeal to Honour and Justice. Because the presence of a name on a title page is not necessarily proof of authorship, 18 where the strongest piece of evidence is a title-page attribution the work is labeled "signed" rather than "claimed by Defoe ." Signed. That is, a work is attributed to Defoe (or one of his known pseudonyms) on the title page or otherwise within the text. Contemporary attribution (made in Defoe's lifetime or in the first decade after his death). Late attribution (made any time between the 1740s and the end of the eighteenth century). Deduced from context. This includes works that are possibly referred to in other "Defoe" writings, or for which there is some other external referent. Deduced from content. Items in this category are generally consonant with Defoe's views, include passages similar to passages in "Defoe" writings, or contain favorite allusions or anecdotes. Works belonging to the first category—claimed by Defoe —appear in boldface type in the table. They are the only works for which we have anything like certainty. The other categories are meant to be non-judgmental. In other words, the implication is not that items included on the basis of a contemporary attribution are necessarily more probable than works included because of a late attribution, or that either is preferable to one made on the basis of content alone. This is not a spectrum from very certain to highly doubtful and should not be taken as such. All categories except the first inevitably contain works of varying probability. A work labeled "signed" means that it names Defoe as author (or is attributed to "the Author of the Review" or another pseudonym), or that it has "Defoe" in the title (e.g., no. 98, De Foe's Answer, to Dyer's Scandalous News Letter). Readers need to realize that Furbank and Owens de-attribute some works with such an identifier, as for example Good Advice to the Ladies ... By the Author of The True-Born Englishman ( De-Attributions, no. 46). 19 They observe that "many poems were saddled illegitimately upon" the author of Defoe's most famous poem, and so "one is thrown back on one's stylistic intuitions." 20 Of Good Advice to the Ladies, they conclude that it does not seem stylistically characteristic of Defoe. Whether such a conclusion is accurate or not, the implication is that works signed with one of Defoe's pseudonyms and included as certain in the Bibliography have been admitted on the basis of their plausibility. What Furbank and Owens tend to say in accounts of such works is simply that there "seems no reason to doubt the attribution on the title-page" (e.g., nos. 68, 74, 75). Given that pseudonyms were often fraudulently applied by resourceful publishers, and that mere plausibility is not grounds enough to make an attribution, "signed" is necessarily less definitive than "claimed." Having complained about Furbank and Owens's seemingly arbitrary cutoff date, I need to explain my distinction between "contemporary" and "late" attri 18. For example, Furbank and Owens exclude from the canon The Fifteen Comforts of a Scotch-Man. Written by Daniel D'Foe in Scotland (no. 143 in Defoe De-Attributions) as well as The Modern Addresses Vindicated, and the Rights of the Addressers Asserted, by D. De Foe (no. 177). 19. Another instance is The True-Born Britain. Written by the Author of The True-Born Englishman (Defoe De-Attributions, no. 147). 20. Defoe De-Attributions, 12. bution with particular care. Col. Jacque is ascribed to Defoe in 1738 (seven years after his death) by a respectable publisher named John Applebee (c.i690-1750). Not to count that as a "contemporary" attribution seems silly. 21 That we should extend "contemporary" to include the 1740s is less clear to me, but in this case it would add nothing. None of the works in the Critical Bibliography is included on the basis of an attribution made between 1739 and the early 1750s. 22 After Applebee’s Col. Jacque , the next new attributions come from a 1753 "Life of Defoe " (part of "Cibber’s" Lives of the Poets, now thought to be written by Robert Shiels , on which see below). The three works that are first associated with Defoe by Shiels are Religious Courtship (215), A Journal of the Plague Year (216), and The Political History of the Devil (228). I have labeled those "late" rather than "contemporary," simply because twenty years beyond death seems a significant length of time. Broadly speaking, I regard attributions made in the second half of the eighteenth century as "late." Of course we need to remember that all external evidence—whether "contemporary" or "late"—is suspect, suggestive rather than conclusive. 23 An attribution made in 1714 is usually going to be weighted more heavily than one made in 1753, and both will generally inspire more confidence than one made in the mid-1780s. But even the "contemporary attribution" works, those attributed to Defoe in his lifetime or in the decade after his death, vary in the degree to which they inspire faith or doubt. Robinson Crusoe —a virtually certain ascription—belongs to the "contemporary attribution" category, but so does item 63, Queries upon the Bill against Occasional Conformity, attributed in an anonymous pamphlet to "A Dislocated Hosier ." The "hosier" is very likely Defoe , which is why the ascription counts for Furbank and Owens as solid external evidence—but it is also less direct and certain than an allusion to "Daniel Defoe" by a known individual who was well-informed about the London publishing scene. I point out that roughly a fifth of the "contemporary attribution" items were also attributed in Defoe’s lifetime to someone other than him and/or were in some fashion disclaimed by him. Works belonging to the "deduced-content" category are those supported by no external evidence. They are the weakest attributions, and most of them are considered no more than "probable" by Furbank and Owens . Crudely speaking, these items are those included because they have long been ascribed to Defoe and 21. This is a more or less contemporary attribution, though how much faith we should have in it is something else again. Arthur Sherbo’s ODNB entry on Applebee explains that he "is known principally for his connection" with Defoe , and that he had printed four pamphlets of Defoe’s in the 1720s. This would seem to make Applebee an authoritative source for Defoe —except that all four of those pamphlets were convincingly de-attributed by Furbank and Owens . 22. An apparent exception is The Present State of Jacobitism Considered, which Furbank and Owens include because the preface is signed "D. F." It was attributed by James Ralph in the 1740s (see no. 28 in the table), but the principal basis for its inclusion in the canon is the prefatory signature. 23. Even Moore , not known for rigorous skepticism in the realm of attribution, warned that he had not found contemporary attributions to Defoe reliable, "except when the ascriptions were obvious." He concluded that "the eighteenth century had no extensive or accurate knowledge of Defoe ." See "The Canon of Defoe’s Writings," 161. For some contemporary misattributions, see pp. 161–162. because they are sufficiently consonant with his general thinking to be considered plausible. Sometimes what looks like suggestive evidence turns out to be unhelpful. The case for including 212(P) depends heavily on its use of a verse quotation that had appeared in the Review (from 16 years earlier), but the same passage appears in A Letter from a Gentleman at the Bath (1722), a more contemporaneous work and one never associated with Defoe . The internal evidence in this instance (as in others) is weak. But "deduced-content" should not simply be taken to mean " Defoe probably did not write this work." I tend to think that Defoe is likely to be responsible for (say) A Letter to Mr. Bisset , though the only grounds for thinking so are that it bears some similarities to the polemical device used in The Shortest-Way and the succession pamphlets and that it is not stylistically or thematically implausible. This is not potent evidence, and to consider A Letter to Mr. Bisset more than a probable attribution would be rash. If I could re-write my "Daniel Defoe as Satirist" article, having taken a harder look at the basis for attribution, I would be a good deal more cautious in my handling of A Letter than I was, however plausible Defoe’s authorship. 24 To ignore A Letter entirely is unnecessary, but at present we lack adequate grounds for a confident ascription to Defoe . The case made for the attribution of a "deduced-content" work might be compelling or feeble—but such items should never be regarded unskeptically. The distinction between "deduced-content" and "deduced-context" is often smudgy. Works that contain allusions to other "Defoe" pieces belong to the former category; works that are alluded to in other texts belong to the latter. The attributional evidence for items deduced from context tends to be a bit more convincing than that for those deduced from content because it involves something extrinsic to the text (and to Defoe’s other "known" writings). But again there is wide variation. The strongest evidence for 140(P) and 141(P), Reasons against Fighting and A Further Search into the Conduct of the Allies, comes from a letter. Defoe explains that he is sending to Harley two works, one meant to make "people ... see How The wholl Nation was Forming into One Tribe of Issachar, and Taught to Couch Under The Tyranny of Our Neighbours," and the other written "in Answer to The Dutch Memorialls" with a similar purpose. 25 The subtitle of the A Further Search includes the phrase "a Reply to the several Letters and Memorials of the States-General," and the content of the pamphlets suggests that these are in fact the two letters being referred to by Defoe . The authorship of both is deduced from something outside the text but not explicitly claimed by Defoe himself. The attribution is virtually certain without being absolutely so. One could say the same of 125(P). Several of the "deduced-context" items are works to which Defoe "might have" referred in his letters. The epistolary allusions are frustratingly varied in their specificity. In some cases, Defoe mentions a work more or less by name (see 134(P)), and in those instances I have categorized the work as "claimed." Elsewhere he simply describes a piece he has written or anticipates writing; where an item is supported by these vaguer, more ambiguous references, I have categorized it as "deduced-context." 24. Huntington Library Quarterly 70 (2007): 553–576. 25. The Letters of Daniel Defoe , ed. George Harris Healey (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 376. This is in some ways the least satisfactory of the categories because of the wide range of evidence involved. A highly probable epistolary reference is strong evidence, but an item included because it is a continuation of a work Defoe only "might have" written seems far from being a secure attribution. Item 182(P), Some Considerations on a Law for Triennial Pamphlets, is a shaky "deduced-context" case. The best Furbank and Owens can say about this piece is that Crossley and Lee believe it to be the one to which Defoe refers in an article in the St. James’s Post, and that this hypothesis "seems plausible" (CB, 164). The argument for attribution is somewhat bolstered by a favorite allusion—but it is nothing like as compelling as the evidence for 140(P) and 141(P). Ideally, one would avoid categories even as broad as "deduced-context" and "deduced-content" (and never mind "probable"), but the evidence involved in establishing the Bibliography is such that dividing the relevant items into sub-groups would require far too many categories to be useful. We would need groups for "two favorite allusions," for "two allusions plus one favorite anecdote," for "one possible external reference plus one quotation of a known Defoe writing," and so on. In many cases, Furbank and Owens offer two kinds of evidence—for example, both a contemporary attribution and internal evidence. Almost every attribution could be described as having been deduced from content as well as something else— Furbank and Owens often test external evidence of whatever sort against thematic and stylistic plausibility. To label each item for which this is true "contemporary attribution; deduced-content" would result only in clutter. The category assigned is meant to signal the principal basis for attribution to Defoe . The column at the right of the table explains (in shorthand) the further evidentiary basis where one is offered. The reader is of course referred to the Critical Bibliography for fuller details and explanations. 4. Some Facts, Statistics, and Observations What can we learn from the table that constitutes the appendix to this article? Furbank and Owens do not offer any statistics on what percentage of their canon includes works claimed by Defoe , how many were based on contemporary attributions, and so on—but we can learn much from such a breakdown. Three years before the appearance of the Critical Bibliography, J. A. Downie urged scholars to go "back to the early writings, with the True Collections as the bedrock of the new structure," so that "a different, less flimsy Defoe canon might be constructed." 26 We need to know what "bedrock" consists of, and the tabular representation of the canon should make it plain. Downie is right to point to Defoe’s authorized collections of his own work, and we should also include additional "certains," such as Jure Divino, the Review, An Appeal to Honour and Justice, and the other titles boldfaced in the table. All told, there are 67 items publicly or privately acknowledged by Defoe to be his (plus thirteen reprints from the Review). 27 Most of the 26. Downie , "Defoe’s Early Writings," The Review of English Studies, n.s., 46 (i995): 225–230, at 229–230. 27. My numbers (67 claimed, 28 "signed," and so on) add up to only 270 items. Not included in this count are the two collections (items no. 1 and 2 in CB) and the letters (nos. 272–275). items Defoe claimed are not pieces literary critics have had any interest in; most of the major texts, from our point of view, are missing from this list. But these 67 together do represent a genuinely solid foundation. We have grounds for believing that these are definitive attributions; we cannot be one hundred per cent sure about any other titles. An important fact about the "claimed" items: 37 of them appeared before 1705; 53 were in print by the end of 1710; and none was published after 1715. 28 To put the point differently: Defoe did not acknowledge authorship of a single new piece after the 1715 Appeal to Honour and Justice. This means that a huge proportion of the works about which we can be certain were produced by the end of the first decade of the eighteenth century. Works in the remaining categories (to repeat an important point) are of varying and essentially incalculable degrees of probability. There are 28 "Signed" items: 11 of them include the name " Defoe " on the title page or " Defoe’s " signature within the text, and the other 17 are attributed to one of his noms de plume. The Furbank and Owens canon includes 44 "contemporary attributions" (in my definition). These are the items for which we have what they consider reliable attributions made in Defoe’s lifetime or within a decade of his death. Only 15 items were first attributed later in the eighteenth century ("late attribution"), but 7 of them are of what most of us regard as major works. About those, more shortly. 48 items belong to the "deduced-context" category, and a staggering 67 works fall under "deduced-content." The table shows a sobering amount of white space. Especially as one gets beyond 1706 or so, and certainly beyond 1710, one starts to notice a great many blanks in the middle columns. A virtue of the tabular representation of the canon is that it lets us see very quickly that for a significant number of works, we have neither name nor even pseudonym, and no attribution until the end of the eighteenth century or later. The white space one encounters between items 131(P) and 147(P), or between 205 and 218 ( Roxana ) is unsettling. Unlike Moore , Furbank and Owens are admirably honest in stating what the evidence for most attributions is—but looking at particular items or moving from entry to entry in the Bibliography, one does not see what a startling number of cases lack the kind of support a hard-headed theorist of attribution would demand. The blanks in the middle columns of the table are part of the reason "deduced-content" and "deduced-context" represent the biggest categories. Most of the former are labeled merely "probable" by Furbank and Owens ; these are the pieces for which we have some thematic or stylistic evidence but nothing external. The fact that there are the same number of "deduced-content" items and "claimed" items is worrying (each category accounts for roughly twenty-five per cent of the whole). One can only conclude that a frightening proportion of the canon is founded on critics’ sense that a particular work is consonant with Defoe’s outlook and techniques. Should we permit some degree of stylistic/thematic consonance, or some number of parallels, to count as sufficient grounds for inclusion 28. The Compleat English Gentleman (not published until the nineteenth century) was probably written in the late 1720s; Of Royall Educacion, which is included in the holograph manuscript of The Compleat English Gentleman, is difficult to date with precision, but at least parts of it were apparently written after the accession of George II in 1727. of a work as "probable"? The argument in favor of including them is that, were we to de-attribute every item for which we have no definite external evidence, much of " Defoe " would evaporate. Granting that at some point the number of striking parallels might become highly persuasive, however, parallels do not prove anything. A reader of the Review might be in agreement with its position and reproduce some ideas or passages elsewhere. One can pick up phrases from others, or try to imitate another’s style; stealing phrases and sentences and paragraphs was hardly unusual for eighteenth-century journalists and pamphleteers. We cannot disprove Defoe’s authorship in the "deduced-content" cases, but the most we can say with any confidence is that such pieces correspond with his style and opinions. The same could be said of the "deduced-context" items, several of which are in the canon on the basis of decidedly thin evidence. The only case made in support of item 95 is that it was reprinted in the Review. Passages from item 97 were also reprinted there, though as Furbank and Owens admit, "the overall context [in 97] is somewhat more conciliatory" (CB, 88). Both of these pamphlets seem better classified as probable rather than definite attributions; they are among the most worrisome of the "deduced-context" items. Other problematic cases belonging to that category are 187(P) and 196(P). Furbank and Owens consider these pamphlets to be probable attributions primarily because they are acclaimed (separately) in Mercurius Politicus, a journal " Defoe admitted having been associated with." 29 The first is "praised as one of the ‘merriest Pieces of Drollery’," and the second is "puffed" in an "obtrusive manner" (CB, 168, 181). That Defoe would reprint works not by others in the Review is entirely conceivable, and (assuming he is responsible for the relevant passages in Mercurius Politicus) he might well have been prepared to express approval of pieces written by others that were in accord with his own thinking. In such instances, the external "evidence" is at best unsatisfactory. The table lets us see some patterns. This is not the place to consider all of the implications at great length, but a few points need to be made. The overwhelming majority of "claimed by Defoe " cases appear early in the table. If one looks at the first column (the item number in Furbank and Owens ), one discovers several long strings of "probable" cases. From 111(P) to 143(P), all but three items are labeled merely "probable." From 173(P) to 193(P), Furbank and Owens label only four items as certain. In the last instance, what this means is that seventeen of the twenty-one " Defoe " works published between April 1715 and late spring 1717 are only probably his. I note in passing that for that particular time period, Defoe is also not known to have been involved in any periodicals. The broader point here is that for significant lengths of time, we have little definite knowledge of what Defoe was doing. Between 1704 and 1713, he was running the Review, but beyond that we are sometimes in the dark. The layout of the Critical Bibliography does not make these patterns at all clear. 29. CB, 168. Furbank and Owens say that "we have Defoe’s own word for it that he was closely associated in an editorial capacity" with Mercurius Politicus, and that "it seems likely that Defoe , despite certain allusions in its pages to its ‘editors’ in the plural, was its founder and chief editor." They conclude that "it can be safely assumed that he wrote for [Mercurius Politicus, as well as Mist’s Journal] extensively" (CB, 242). See also their " Defoe , the De la Faye letters and Mercurius politicus," British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies 23 (2000): 13–19. The scariest fact about the "Defoe" canon is not the small number of "certain" works, but rather that the novels are not among them. Both Crusoe and Col. Jacque are relatively secure "contemporary attribution" items—the first attributed by Gildon in 1719 and the second attributed by Applebee in 1738. Gildon also attributed Farther Adventures to Defoe ; the ascription of Serious Reflections is based on "deduced-context," as it is included on the basis of its connection to the first part. Every other piece of major fiction is in the canon on the basis of a late attribution—in most cases, a very late attribution. A Journal of the Plague Year showed up in Shiels’s 1753 short list of Defoe’s writings, which is twenty-two years after Defoe’s death, but also more than twenty years before Noble associated Defoe with Moll Flanders , Roxana , and Memoirs of a Cavalier. In terms of the solidity of our evidentiary basis, a late claim by the shady Noble is nothing like the same thing as a self-identified work or even a (genuinely) contemporary ascription. Moll and Roxana are great books, but they are far from certain attributions. 5. Some Problems and Suggestions Defoe represents a unique challenge. A tiny number of personal letters survive, and those are late-life and probably not typical; the writings we can attribute with confidence tell us much about his causes and commitments but not a lot about him as a man. Other major eighteenth-century writers published anonymously, but he is unusual in having put his name on so few works. From the end of the eighteenth century to the third quarter of the twentieth, a gigantically inflated canon grew up around him, most of it based on irresponsible attributions. At this late date we now need to confront two separate but related problems. The first is that many of our deeply ingrained ideas about Defoe have their basis in Moore’s canon, which has been (for most of us) effectively demolished. The second is that the Furbank and Owens canon is nowhere near as solid as we would like to believe. If we are going to tackle Defoe with confidence on a factual basis, then we need to reconsider just about everything. The Critical Bibliography represents a huge advance on Moore’s Checklist, and we owe Furbank and Owens a profound debt of gratitude—but (as they themselves would say) we need to use the new canon responsibly if we are to avoid creating a further mess. The blunt truth is that we cannot afford to pretend that Furbank and Owens have settled the canon for us—which they never claimed to have done. In Starr’s favorable review of the Bibliography, he rightly praises Furbank and Owens for not writing with "an air of finality, of having fixed the canon once and for all" (585). Works entered with no cautionary "P" are not necessarily proven attributions, and those with a "P" are anything but close-to- certain. Furbank and Owens understand this—but any item-by-item survey at book length inevitably creates a close focus on individual items. For details of particular cases, it is a tremendous resource; for comprehension of the basis of the canon as a whole, it necessarily has limitations. The table constituting the appendix to this essay was conceived as a kind of second step, an enhanced view of the same material for different ends. The bottom line is that we cannot assume that the Critical Bibliography represents a firm foundation. In some ways, it seems to be more conservative than it actually is. Most of us feel quite certain that Defoe wrote a lot of the items not labeled "claimed by Defoe " in the table, and we are possibly right. But our sense that he wrote some and even many of these works does not justify our behaving as though he wrote all of them or any particular one of them. Instinct and plausibility and even some degree of probability we have—but that is not grounds for attribution. I wholly concur with Starr’s judgment: "My own view is that there are really rather few works that we can say were Defoe’s with anything approaching ‘certainty,’ using that term in the everyday rather than the Humean sense, and that the sum should be smaller than Furbank and Owens’s figure of 160" (587–588). By my reckoning, at present our solid canon consists of 67 works (not counting the thirteen items reprinted from the Review ). Might quantitative stylistic analysis allow us to expand that canon with confidence? The answer unfortunately seems to be No. Quantitative methods of attribution have not worked very well to date, and there have been some problems—as for example Martin C. Battestin’s New Essays by Henry Fielding (1989), which claimed Fielding’s authorship of forty-one Craftsman essays almost entirely on the basis of stylistic parallels. 30 Reviews of the volume were few and largely uncritical, though some critics did complain about illegitimate stylistic parallels and generally inadequate evidence. 31 The Craftsman attributions were not disproven until 2008, 32 by which point they had done serious damage to the field; they will no doubt continue to do so for many years to come. Battestin has since transferred his allegiance to the Cusum method, a different kind of stylometric analysis, 33 whose legitimacy has also been called into question. In a devastating rejection of quantitatively-based theories of attribution, and of Cusum (or QSUM) analysis in particular, Stephen Karian offers this blunt verdict: QSUM uses vague definitions for its terms, misuses a valid statistical technique, and relies on visual inspection without employing a standardized method for calculating scale. Finally, it does not, in any sense of the word, ‘work.’ QSUM has no validity. ... This method is so faulty that one can manipulate it to claim any position on any particular attribution. 34 Karian’s sober analysis and critique bears out his conclusion that the Cusum method "cannot be rescued." 30.

The only vehemently negative review was by Claude Rawson , "Fielding in the Dock," London Review of Books, 5 April 1990, 20–23. Milder reservations were expressed by Hugh Amory in ‘"It Is Very Probable I Am Lord B — ke’: Reflections on Fielding’s Canon ," Eighteenth-Century Fiction 8 (1996): 529–533; and by Simon Varey in The Scriblerian 25 (1992): 56–59. 32.

Supposing someone actually did develop a more reliable method of stylistic analysis, how effective would it be if applied to Defoe ? 35 Defoe turns out to be highly problematic as a subject for quantitative analysis. The lack of a sufficient number of works irrefutably attributed to him makes stylistic comparison dangerous at best. We just do not have enough to constitute a satisfactory sample. 36 A writer like Fielding , whose output is mostly signed, is a different proposition. The majority of the works we can feel reasonably confident that Defoe wrote, moreover, date from quite early in his career. Would stylistic markers from The True-Born Englishman or The Shortest-Way or even the Review help us with Roxana? This seems highly unlikely: such works differ generically as well as modally, and never mind the broad chronological spread of composition involved. 37 Including a work in the canon on the basis of internal parallels to other supposed " Defoe " pieces is unwise: as Furbank and Owens warn, we cannot count a work as Defoe’s because it sounds like other things he might have written. A related danger is that of over-emphasizing stylistic similarities and not considering significant stylistic discrepancies, a point Rodney M. Baine made in his de-attribution of Madagascar: or, Robert Drury’s Journal 38 What about paragraph lengths and common phrases? Maximillian E. Novak in particular weights these very heavily, maintaining that "wide paragraph length 35. Furbank and Owens raise the issue of stylometry, and even produced computergenerated concordances of Moll and Robinson Crusoe . They point out that while stylometry might conceivably be useful if one is trying to decide between two candidates for authorship, where the field is virtually limitless much of the utility vanishes: "it was illusory to suppose, as some stylometrists claim, that an author has a unique statistical ‘fingerprint,’ distinguishing him or her from all others." They also warn that the "temptation to get the answer you want ... is simply too compelling." See "The Defoe That Never Was: A Tale of De-Attribution," The American Scholar 66 (1997): 276–284, at 283. 36. In his 1974 stylometric study of parts of Defoe’s canon, Stieg Hargevik identified words, phrases, syntactical structures, and sentence patterns that he found to be indicative of Defoe’s style, measuring their appearance in Defoe’s writings against their appearance in the work of his contemporaries. He demonstrated that the stylistic tendencies he regarded as Defovian appeared only very rarely in select texts by Abel Boyer , Anthony Collins , Benjamin Hoadly , Swift and others. See The Disputed Assignment of Memoirs of an English Officer to Daniel Defoe , in two parts ( Stockholm : Almqvist and Wiskell , 1974), Part I. The problem with this methodology is that for it to be seriously effective we would need more definitive attributions and then we would need to test them against a very large sample of different kinds of writings. Hargevik himself admits that statistical methods can only "indicate likelihood and not proof" (26). For a cautious defense of Hargevik’s methods and findings, see Irving N. Rothman , " Defoe De-Attributions Scrutinized under Hargevik Criteria: Applying Stylometrics to the Canon," PBSA 94 (2000): 375–398. I concur with Furbank and Owens that, especially in the case of Defoe , stylistic analysis is insufficient to solve attributional puzzles. As they remind us, "stylo-metricians are unlikely to present their results as ‘unambiguous’ and self-sufficient, requiring no support from other and non-stylometric types of reasoning" (Canonisation, 177). 37. I do not share Moore’s faith that "the Defoe who wrote the boyish religious verse of 1681 is astonishingly like the elderly man who published social and economic tracts forty-nine years later. We can trace him through his Protean changes of appearance. If we hold him tightly, he remains essentially himself" ("The Canon of Defoe’s Writings," 164). 38. Baine , "Daniel Defoe and Robert Drury’s Journal," Texas Studies in Literature and Language 16 (1974): 479–491, especially pp. 484–486. "The wider the Defoe canon becomes, the easier it is to establish other attributions of the basis of style and idiom. We have a widening gyre whose center will not hold" (484). variations" are uniquely characteristic of Defoe , as are "[p]aragraph beginnings with generalized phrases such as "Tis’." 39 So if we see a pamphlet whose paragraphs often begin with "It is said," "It is," "I know," and "As to the," should we assume that is Defoe revealing himself to us? The utility of such a test seems far from clear. "Defoeisms" such as "I say" and "viz." and "In a word" seem equally unhelpful: such generic language patterns seem unlikely to provide the answer to our problems. Stylistic analysis may some day be more useful in particular cases than it has hitherto proved, but the uncertainties surrounding Defoe and his canon make application of such analysis to him especially difficult. If future work in this realm can convincingly settle the authorship of individual items, then that would of course be a major improvement, but at present there seems little possibility of using style to substantiate uncertain attributions. What, then, are we to do? The crux of the answer is that we cannot afford to ignore the uncertainties that are probably an irresoluble feature of the Defoe bibliography. We need to learn to live with a much-reduced canon. In the post- Furbank -and- Owens era, more scholars will naturally want to re-attribute questionable titles than de-attribute yet more of them, but the temptation to rescue favorite items is best resisted. Erring too far in the direction of conservative attribution is at worst a shame; erring too far in the opposite direction is a disaster. We therefore need to come to each item in the Critical Bibliography —no matter how often taught or how heavily written upon—without commitment to its retention. In time we can return to the De-Attributions and reconsider them. But we need first to make sure we are using the Bibliography in ways that are intellectually honest and methodologically defensible—in ways worthy of the careful work it represents. Ideally we would find evidence either to bolster current attributions or to disprove them, and (in principle) we ought to be equally glad of either. 40 At this point, we can decide simply to ignore the problems and carry on, building anew atop woefully shaky foundations. Alternatively, we can decide not to base interpretations or biographical constructions on the Furbank and Owens canon without considerable caution and admission of its limitations. What does "caution" look like in practical terms? The 67 works unambiguously claimed by Defoe are safe. Beyond that, how a particular text gets treated should depend not on whether Furbank and Owens include it but on what sort of evidence we have for it—and even where the nature of the evidence is similar, the probability can vary drastically. This is an obvious conclusion, but it needs to be made explicit and acted upon, especially since even Furbank and Owens at times seem too casual about 39. Novak , " A Vindication of the Press and the Defoe Canon," Studies in English Literature 27 (1987): 399–411, at 406–407. Stephen Bernard has demonstrated conclusively, on the basis of internal and external evidence, that A Vindication of the Press was written not by Defoe but by Giles Jacob . See " After Defoe , Before the Dunciad: Giles Jacob and A Vindication of the Press," The Review of English Studies, n.s., 59 (2008): 487–507. 40. Schoenbaum’s counsel is wise: "It is good, I believe, that now and then we pay tribute to the virtue of recognizing our limitations," he concludes, and the scholar "must have his own kind of negative capability. He must know and accept the often frustrating limitations of the methods available to him if, in his quest to dispel illusions and errors, he is not to create new ones in their place" ( Internal Evidence, 219). their own distinction. Take the example of Atalantis Major (122(P)). In a 26 December 1710 letter to Harley , Defoe explains that he had come into possession of "Two Vile Ill Natur’d Pamphlets," one of which (he says) is Atalantis Major. "It is Certainly Written by Some English man, and I have Some Guess at the Man, but dare not be positive," he tells Harley , but also that he will insure that the pamphlet is suppressed in Edinburgh . Furbank and Owens conclude that, Defoe’s comments notwithstanding, "It is ... generally agreed that this ‘Vile’ tract was Defoe’s own work: above all because it corresponds so closely to what he had written earlier to Harley ." 41 Whether Defoe is being partially or wholly disingenuous we will never know, which is presumably why Furbank and Owens regard Atalantis Major as merely probable. When they discuss the pamphlet in their Political Biography of Daniel Defoe (2006), however, they say simply that "the author, undoubtedly, was Defoe himself." 42 If there is in fact no doubt, why brand the item "P" in the Bibliography? Conceivably their position changed between 1998 and 2006, but if so the reason for the shift should have been explained. The discussion of The Commentator, one of the "P" journals, likewise reflects misleading certitude about the attribution. Furbank and Owens explain that Defoe "launched a new periodical," that he "began to lose interest in his Commentator," and so on, with no indication of dubiety. Making distinctions between probable and certain is of little use if we are not going to apply those distinctions to our critical treatments of Defoe . One of the implications of the canon problem is that our comprehension of " Defoe " is based principally on the body of works attributed to him: who he was depends upon what he wrote. 43 And if a significant percentage of the items included in the Furbank and Owens canon are uncertain, then so too are our characterizations, both critical and biographical. The two most substantial modern biographers of Defoe , Paula R. Backscheider (1989) and Novak (2001), both decided to stick with Moore’s canon, with the exception of a small number of works. 44 Backscheider was finishing her Daniel Defoe : His Life just as Furbank and Owens were beginning to publish their misgivings about the canon. Novak had more opportunity to revise his account, though by the time of Furbank and Owens ’s advent on the Defoe scene, he too had been working for many years on his Daniel Defoe , Master of Fictions. In his introduction, he objects to Furbank and Owens ’s dismissal of stylistic evidence, explaining that he is "draw[ing] upon [his] years of reading [ Defoe’s ] texts and those of his contemporaries." Novak’s commitment to his own sense of Defoe’s corpus (which is not identical to Moore’s 41. CB, 111. For Defoe’s quotations, see Letters, 306–307. 42. A Political Biography of Daniel Defoe ( London : Pickering &amp; Chatto , 2006), 113, 177, 182. 43. For a discussion of the various ways in which " Defoe " has been constructed by biographers and critics, see my "Fabricating Defoes: From Anonymous Hack to Master of Fictions," Eighteenth-Century Life 36.2 (Spring 2012): i–35. 44. John Richetti’s more recent biography of Defoe is based on the Furbank and Owens canon (with only a few exceptions). Richetti makes a good point: "even Furbank and Owens cannot resolve the uncertainty surrounding some of what we think is Defoe’s massive output, and in their Critical Bibliography ... they list works that are ‘probably’ by Defoe , and in their ongoing collected edition of large numbers of Defoe’s works they ... reprint and annotate some of those pieces that they mark as merely probable in their Critical Bibliography ." The Life of Daniel Defoe ( Malden , MA, and Oxford : Blackwell , 2005), vii. canon) reflects his conviction that he can recognize his subject’s "style and thought." 45 From the conservative standpoint espoused by Furbank and Owens, this is problematic. In any case, we are left with two much-quoted accounts of the life that are based on a huge canon for which we have no solid proof—and in a position of having to rethink from the ground up almost everything we thought we knew about what sort of person and writer Defoe really was. We need to be prepared to test every bit of inherited wisdom about Defoe . What kind of writer was he, really? Does the fact that he was a master fabricator, able to mimic voices not his own, strengthen the case for his authorship of Moll Flanders and Roxana ? Perhaps, but first we need to ask whether he was in fact a master fabricator. The letters to Harley are ample proof of his willingness and ability to lie, but how many of the 67 works we can be sure about involve mimicry and impersonation? Item no. 20 is ostensibly by a member of the "Yeomandry, and poor Freeholders of England " (p. 3); no. 144 is in the voice of "an Englishman at the court of Hannover "; in no. 148 (like no. 144, one of the 1713 succession pamphlets), Defoe assumes the guise of a Jacobite pressing for the return of the Pretender; and no. 37 is The Shortest-Way , his most brilliant piece of satiric impersonation. No. 52 is "in the person of a Dissenter" (CB, 48), so not Defoe -speaking-as- Defoe but hardly a feat of mimicry. In these five works, Defoe assumes a voice not his own, or at least not only his. The Shortest-Way alone proves his capacity as a mimic, but his inclination toward mimicry is not necessarily on the scale critics have long imagined. If we add Robinson Crusoe, we have another example of a persona not identical to Defoe . If Defoe did write (say) Moll Flanders, then we have a dissenting Protestant male assuming the persona of a female pickpocket cum prostitute. This does not seem to be impersonation of the sort we find either in The Shortest-Way or Crusoe. Could Defoe have done a different kind of mimicry? Yes. Does the rest of his output lend credence to the argument that he actually did so? No. What is crucial here is that we need to look again, and skeptically, at every established verity. Some of them will withstand further scrutiny—but they cannot be relied upon until they are tested against a much smaller canon. This is a frustrating state of affairs, all the more so because it could have been avoided. Half a century ago, Moore produced a bibliography which was de facto unreviewable; he did not explain the evidentiary basis for particular attributions, making judging plausibility functionally impossible. That reviewers did not assess his Checklist in nitty-gritty detail is not astonishing. Lacking the evidence, how could they have done so? What is dismaying is that the contents of an unverified and essentially unverifiable list were so widely accepted. One of the lessons we should learn from the history of the Defoe canon is that we need to be much tougherminded about how we respond to new attributions. R. S. Crane long ago warned against letting one’s "guiding principle" in interpretation be "a will to believe." 46 In the case of attribution, we would do well to be driven by a will to doubt. For the 45. Novak, Daniel Defoe , Master of Fictions: His Life and Ideas (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 5. 46.

( Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 1967), 2:241. present problem, Defoe is himself to some extent to blame. Had he left behind a signed or validated canon, we would have one. Instead, we are left with a famously protean writer about whom we have painfully little definite personal information and who evidently relished his ability to "Disguise" his "Stile." The future of Defoe studies will depend heavily upon how we proceed from here. Some scholars have resisted abandoning Moore’s Checklist, though many Defoe scholars have cheerfully restricted themselves to Furbank and Owens’s canon. The idea of shrinking further is probably a hard sell for most scholars, especially when several of the major works are not exempt from skepticism. I do not see my conclusions as negative or gloomy. We are probably always going to be left with a significant degree of uncertainty about quite a lot of even the reduced " Defoe " canon: the problem is not lack of certitude in attribution but in refusing to admit that lack. Historical study is at best difficult, and the troubling question of how we can know the past at all is always with us. G. Thomas Tanselle has observed that "The essence of any inductive process, such as ... the pursuit of the past, is uncertainty," and he has a point. 47 The record that has come down to us is incomplete—as the increasing concern with attribution and (more broadly) with the realities, frustrations, and implications of anonymous publication makes clear. A considerable part of what we think we know is the result of potentially fallible inductive reasoning, not just something read or discovered. Refusing to go beyond the bounds of what critical judgment can justify is crucial—which brings us back to the practicalities of weighing such evidence as we have and living with its limitations. We need to remember that the " Defoe " we now study and teach is a relatively recent construction. Half a century ago, Defoe was very differently judged and valued. Let me propose a counterfactual. Imagine that we were transported back to the 1930s—before Ian Watt and others turned Defoe into the father of the English novel; before Moore inflated the canon; before a flock of New Critics set about demonstrating Defoe ’s artistry and the cohesion of his novels. Suppose that in those circumstances scholars had started from scratch, applying the sober attribution methods and standards that specialist readers for leading learned journals would insist upon today. What canon would be constructed for Daniel Defoe ? What picture of the life-and-works? Doggedly maintaining faith in a canon we cannot defend does not make sense: if we are going to set the bibliographic situation aright, then this is the time to do so. The question now before us is whether we will finally face facts or continue to play the ostrich. 48 47.

An oral version of this essay was presented at the second biennial meeting of the Defoe Society, July 2011. For advice on drafts, I am grateful to Julian Fung , Patricia Gael , Robert D. Hume , Leah Orr , and David Wallace Spielman . The anonymous readers for Studies in Bibliography provided extensive and extremely useful commentary for which I am grateful. For technological assistance I am much obliged to Tom Minsker. Obviously I am deeply indebted to Furbank and Owens, who meticulously assembled the complex mass of evidence I have recast and analyzed here. This enterprise depends on their pioneering work. I did not consult them about this piece, and any blame attaching to it must be mine. If Defoe studies has a good future it is largely because of Furbank and Owens’s efforts. APPENDIX A Tabular Representation of the Furbank And Owens Canon For an explanation of the logic of categorization and the analytic rationale of this presentation of the works attributed to Defoe by Furbank and Owens (both definite and "probable"), see section 3, above. Unless otherwise stated, all quotations and details in the table are from the relevant entry in the Critical Bibliography . The numeration is also from that volume; the table begins with item number 3 because numbers 1 and 2 are collections of works (the True Collection and the Second Volume ). I have filled in as many columns as possible, but in most cases works are categorized on the basis of the strongest evidence. For example: in the case of items claimed by Defoe , I also list any other contemporary or late-life evidence in attribution noted by Furbank and Owens. Limitations of space require considerable abbreviation, including the shortening of most titles; that information is of course supplied more fully in the Critical Bibliography . The table includes a number of shorthand references. Several initially anonymous works were reprinted in collections in Defoe ’s lifetime with his name attached (column 7, "Reprint"). 1 TC Defoe ’s A True Collection of the Writings of the True Born English-man (an authorized collection published in 1703). SV Defoe ’s A Second Volume of the Writings of the Author of the True-Born Englishman (an authorized collection published in 1705). How A Collection of the Writings of the Author of the True-Born English-Man (an unauthorized collection by John How in 1703); the volume included thirteen works, two of which (11(P) and 40(P)) Defoe did not include in the True Collection. Column 8 ("Epithet") lists instances where a work is signed with one of Defoe ’s pseudonyms, which take the form of "by the author of [work]." To save space, I give only the title or an abbreviation (i.e., SW for The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters and TBE for The True-Born Englishman) . Where I say "Review," then, the item in question is attributed on the title page to "the author of the Review." The tenth and eleventh columns record late attributions, those made in the second half of the century ("Later 18c") or between the beginning of the nineteenth century and the present ("After 18c"). The source of the attribution is given there. I take the assignment of attribution from Furbank and Owens, and except in one case (I have changed "Cibber" to "Cibber/Shiels") I use their shorthand terms. Chalmers George Chalmers in his "List of Writings" of Defoe , included in his Life of Daniel De Foe (1790). Cibber/Shiels Robert Shiels in "Cibber’s" The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland , 5 vols. (1753); the entry on Defoe is in vol. 4 (pp. 313–325). 1. A "second edition" of the True Collection appeared in 1705 (including the same items as the first). This Collection and the Second Volume were reissued in two parts as A True Collection ... The Third Edition in 1710, and again in 1711 as the two-volume Collection of the Writings of the Author of the True-Born Englishman. Forty items were reprinted in the two-volume The Genuine Works of Daniel D’Foe, Author of The True-born English-Man ([1721]), perhaps an unauthorized collection (and an expensive one at 12 shillings). All of the items included in these collections were printed either in the original True Collection or in the Second Volume . Crossley James Crossley in his MS list of 60 " Defoe " works; the list was made between 1869 and 1883 and is reprinted in Furbank and Owens, Canonisation .

Ellis says that "The evidence for Defoe's authorship ... lies mainly in his quotation of the poem in" issues of the Review (48). 6. Four stanzas were also "quoted in Cursory Remarks upon Some Late Disloyal Proceedings in Several Cabals (1699)," a volume not associated with Defoe ( CB, 16). 7. For example, [ William Pittis?], The True-Born Hugonot: or, Daniel de Foe (1703). 8. Animadversions on the Succession to the Crown of England , Consider'd (1701), 1. Also in two 1703 pamphlets ( CB , 26). 9. Furbank and Owens observe that this item was "widely attributed" to Defoe by contemporaries (including Tutchin), though Defoe (almost certainly disingenuously) denied authorship ( CB , 27). 10. This is probably the piece James Drake attributes to "Legion" in The Source of our Present Fears Discover'd (1703), 32. 11. This pamphlet was "widely attributed" to Defoe, including by Pittis (?) in The True-Born Hugonot, p. 10 ( CB , 29). 12. Ralph, History of England : During the Reigns of K. William , Q. Anne , and K. George I , 2 vols. (1744–46), 2:999. 13. Reprinted in A Collection of Scarce and Valuable Tracts , 4 vols. (1748), 3:114–124, attributed to "T.G." ( Thomas Gordon ?). 14. Extracts adapted and reprinted in The Modern Addresses Vindicated ... by D. De Foe (1710), which has sometimes been mistakenly attributed to Defoe ( CB , 32). 15. The first edition was attributed to "the Author of the Preface to Mr. Howe ." 16. See for example The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters ... with its Author's Brief Explication Consider'd, his Name Expos'd... and The Fox with his Firebrand Unkennell'd and Insnar'd (both 1703). 17. See note to 11(P). 18. "Defoe's authorship is made clear in an 'advertisement' on the verso of the title-page" of the first edition ( CB , 41). 19. 19. A Dialogue between the Pillory and Daniel de Foe . 20. Chalmers found the piece attributed to Defoe in a catalogue by William Collins ( CB , 43). 21. The author of Remarks on the Author of the Hymn to the Pillory assumes that this item was written by Defoe ( CB , 43). 22. Furbank and Owens note that, in addition to the preface being signed "D.F.," one part of item 46 is signed " Daniel de Foe " ( CB , 44). 23. 23. "An Unknown Defoe Broadsheet on the Regulation of the Press?", The Library , 5 th ser., 33 (1978): 51–58. Downie explains that an anonymous informer sent this piece to Harley and attributed it to Defoe. 24. An anonymous writer attributed this poem to "our Legionite" in the preface to The Whig's Scandalous Address Answered Stanza by Stanza (1703). John Dyer 's News-Letter in October 1704 implied Defoe's authorship. Furbank and Owens point out, however, that in a 1710 letter, Defoe "reproaches Dyer for having reported him as fled from justice, when in fact he was on a journey, and there was not 'the least Charge Against me for being Concern'd in it' ( Letters , p. 269)" ( CB , 51–52). Elsewhere, they explain that they "are inclined to think that Defoe was its author, on the (admittedly slender) grounds that the first line from it is quoted in An Elegy on the Author of the True-Born Englishman ... and that Sammen who dispersed it was evidently a friend of Defoe's." See their "New Light on John Pierce , Defoe's Agent in Scotland ," Edinburgh Bibliographical Society Transactions 6 (1998): 134–143, at 136. 25. The author of Stockings out at Heel (1705) attributes this piece to "A Dislocated Hosier" ( CB , 58). 26. "No independently published edition of this work has been found" ( CB , 59). The item was first published in SV. 27. Charles Leslie and others attributed this to Defoe by 1708 (when he openly acknowledged authorship); see CB , 62. 28. Defoe does not claim this piece by name, but his advertising it in the Review as by the author of The True-Born Englishman provides a tacit admission of authorship. 29. Advertised in the Review for 7 August 1705 as "by the Author of the True-Born English-Man." 30. Furbank and Owens also point out that "Defoe later [in 1711] became a vociferous champion for the firm of Brooke and Hellier , when they tried to break into the retail trade in Portugese wine" ( CB , 67). 31. Furbank and Owens refer to another work that includes the same Buder quotation, concluding in that instance that "Although this line is sometimes quoted by Defoe ... there is little reason to think that he was the author" of the work at issue ( CB , 64). 32. Observations on the Bankrupts Bill , a response to " Mr. Daniel De Foe ." 33. Rodney M. Baine quotes a 1734 essay in The Universal Spectator , whose author suggests that the same person was responsible for both this item and An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions. "This reference," Baine concludes, "gives us our first evidence that Defoe wrote A True Relation of the Apparition of Mrs. Veal " See Daniel Defoe and the Supernatural (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1968), 93. 34. Jure Divino Toss'd in a Blanket: or, Daniel De Foe 's Memorial (in POAS , 1707) and elsewhere (see CB , 76). 35. A Second Defence of the Scotish Vision . 36. See Frank H. Ellis , "Notes for an Edition of Defoe's Verse," The Review of English Studies , n.s., 32 (1981): 398–407. What Defoe says in his 28 November 1706 letter to Harley is "I Gould not Refrain sending you a peice of my Ld Beilhavens Poetry in Answer to the Ballad" ( Letters , 162). 37. Robert Wodrow (1679–1734), an eighteenth-century collector of books and manuscripts, often wrote what he believed to be the author's name on title pages of pieces he acquired; Furbank and Owens do not accept all of the pieces that were first attributed by Wodrow. See Defoe De-Attributions , xv-xvi, and CB , xiv. Because these annotations were made over a period of time, I have not given a precise date of his ascription of the relevant items. 38. What Defoe writes to Harley is this: "They go to morrow on the 5th Article. They have been Debateing it last sitting, and here is a mighty popular Objection against on Account of their shipping. The Enclosed will Explain it more particularly, which I Wrot at the Desire of the E's of Abercorn, Sutherland, and some Members of the Commons, to prepare them against to morrows Debate" ( Letters , 154). That the "Enclosed" is item 85 is highly likely, but the allusion is not as unambiguous as (for example) in the case of 134(P). 39. On 9 December 1706, Defoe writes to Harley, "I am printing a Single sheet Entituled a Letter to the Glasgow men," and on 12 December he says, "The paper I mentioned in my last About the Glasgow men I send you Enclosed. Tis a plain but Course Expostulation and they Flatter me it has done a great Deal of service here" ( Letters , 169, 170). 40. See note to no. 85. 41. What Defoe says to Harley (17 January 1707) is this: "Since the papers I lately sent you I have printed here Two Essayes. One I Enclose you here; The Other shall be sent The Next post" ( Letters , 194). Furbank and Owens, following Healey, believe the "One" to be item 90, and the "Other" to be item 91. 42. Pamphlets nos. 92, 93, and 94 are part of a controversy with the Rev. James Webster . Furbank and Owens: "The second of the three pamphlets addressed to Webster makes it plain that the author is, and is known by Webster to be, Defoe" ( CB , 84). In a 27 January 1707 letter to Harley, Defoe says, "I sent you the last letter The Attempt of One Webster, a minister, against the Dissenters, I here Send my Answer to him" ( Letters , 196). 43. I have labeled item no. 94 "deduced-context" instead of "contemporary attribution" because in this case the contextual evidence (for which see previous note) is more persuasive than the contemporary attribution. A second edition appeared the same year under the title The Dissenters Vindicated; or, A Short View of the Present State of the Protestant Religion in Britain . Toland attributes The Dissenters Vindicated to Defoe in his Second Part of the State Anatomy (1717), p. 46. 44. "It seems likely that Robert Wodrow was referring to it in a letter ... of 13 March 1711, where he remarked that 'the foolish plea of persecution' by Episcopal pamphleteers 'is fully answered by ... Defoe' ( CB , 87). 45. 45. Just Reprimand to Daniel De Foe , the author (Defoe's target, James Clark ) "takes it for granted that [the piece] is by Defoe himself" ( CB , 90). 46. The letter is dated 29 June 1708, and printed in Furbank and Owens, "Defoe as Secret Agent." What Defoe says to Godolphin is this: "Enclosed I send your Ldpp the printed paper I promised (in my Last but one) should Come last post, but Could not be ready; your Ldpp will see by it The steps I am Taking. It would be a most usefull Encouragement to kno' if your Ldpp approves Thi, and My Design of Dispersing it over the wholl Island , in a Method I noted to your Ldpp was formally Done in the Case of the reply to the Memoriall. It is but a short piece, but I am perswaded it may be usefull, and I shall Follow it with Another, and perhaps a Third, to expose the Conjunction of These men with the Enemies of the Government. I have sent this up this post to be printed in England ; your Ldpp will perceive I have Disguised the Stile, and I am perswaded no body will so much as guess it is mine" (150). Furbank and Owens suggest that the "reply to the Memoriall" to which Defoe refers is likely to be The High-Church Legion , and the "Another" he anticipates is probably Scotland in Danger , item no. 250h (see notes 37 and 38). 47. The pamphlet was attributed to "the Author of the Reviews" in the Edinburgh edition of the Review ( CB , 92). Also see the note to no. 85 for Wodrow's ascription of it to Defoe. 48. Advertised in the Review for 11 March 1712 as "by the Author of the Review " ( CB , 95). 49. In a 5 September 1710 letter to Harley, Defoe boasts, "I am Vain of Saying Sir The first Step I Took has been Successfull and has done More Service Than I Expected, in which The Town does me too much Honour, in Supposeing it well Enough done to be your Own. I Mean the Essay Upon Credit" ( Letters , 276-277). The Essay is attributed to Harley in A Collection of Scarce and Valuable Tracts , 2:1–9. So is no. no (2:10–18). 50. In a 5 September 1710 letter to Harley, Defoe says, "If you Think it proper, I would Offer Another Piece of The Same kind [as An Essay upon Publiek Credit ]; which I would Call an Essay Upon Loans" ( Letters , 277). Item no. no appeared later the same month. 51. The reference is in volume six of Samuel Halkett and John Laing's Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous English Literature , as enlarged by James Kennedy , W. A. Smith , and A. F. Johnson (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1932), p. 304 (under the tide "Captain Tom's ballad; or, Captain Tom's lamentation for his mob's tribulation"). 52. Furbank and Owens admit that "With a fraction more hesitation, since there are no 'Captain Tom' allusions in the Review at this time, and the style is more demotic ... one can apply the same argument in support of Defoe's authorship as with item 106(P)" ( CB , 104–105). 53. Defoe denied his authorship of this piece, attributing it to someone else. "Nevertheless," Furbank and Owens conclude, "internal evidence strongly suggests his authorship" (CB, 106). 54. History of the Present Parliament , 89. 55. The bookseller Joseph Button wrote to Defoe about this pamphlet c. 25 December 1710: "When you do Bickerstaff I wou'd not ha' you fright all people as you say you will" ( Letters , 305). 56. " Robert Wodrow, in a letter to his wife of 10 May 1711, writes that he is enclosing 'a pamphlet, "Counsel to the Assembly" by Defoe"' ( CB , 109). 57. In a 3 March 1711 letter to Harley, Defoe asks "whether if a Small pamphlett ... were written to Allay the feares and Lessen the Surprize of the people There, to Dispose Them to Consider Calmly of Things, and a Little Encourage Them–whether you may not Think it Usefull at Such a Juncture as This" ( Letters , 320). 58. Defoe refers to this pamphlet as a "Vile Ill Natur'd Pamphlet" and "a Bitter Invective" not by him: "It is Certainly Written by Some English man, and I have Some Guess at the Man, but dare not be positive" ( Letters , 306–307). Furbank and Owens (not unwisely) disbelieve him, "above all because [ Atalantis Major ] corresponds so closely to what he had written earlier to Harley" ( CB , 111). 59. "Defoe was friendly with Dalby Thomas, a governor of the African Company, and was widely believed to be a hired advocate for the company" ( CB , 112). 60. Furbank and Owens also observe that this pamphlet refers to "a writer of much penetration who continually warned the Whigs of the danger of running down credit ... almost certainly an allusion to Defoe." The piece does criticize the Review , but they conclude that such criticism "can probably be taken as a ruse" ( CB , 117). 61. "The tone and complex line of argument as regards Occasional Conformity are very close to those of Defoe's known writings on the subject"; a favorite allusion; reference that suggests "that the author has the backing of fellow Dissenters" ( CB , 119). It was also advertised in the Review . 62. In a 14 February 1712 letter to Harley, Defoe says, "I Reproach my Self with The Answer I gave your Ldpp when you were pleased to Ask me if I had any thing Perticular to Offer, Because I Fully purposed to have Represented a Perticular Case of the Poor keel men of New Castle. ... There is So Much Justice ... in The Case That I Perswade my Self your Ldpp will be pleased with Appearing in behalf of a Thousand Families of poor and Injured Men, who None but God and your Ldpp can Now Deliver; If your Ldpp pleases to give me Leav I would Gladly Lay an Abstract of The Case before you" ( Letters , 369). 63. Although this attribution is deduced from content, and regarded as merely "highly 'probable'" by Furbank and Owens, the detailed reference to Defoe and his career seem to me virtually to constitute a claimed authorship. 64. In "Defoe and the Dutch Alliance: Some Attributions Examined," BJECS 9 (1986): 169–182, Furbank and Owens argue that, of the six pamphlets on 1710–1712 Anglo-Dutch peace negotiations attributed to Defoe by earlier bibliographers, only three are legitimate: 140(P), 141(P), and 143(P). They contend that the Enquiry's "telling rhetorical organization" is "suggestive of Defoe," and that the argument corresponds "with Defoe's position in the Review," which leads them to conclude that "the attribution is correct, and that the pamphlet is by Defoe" (176). Given the certitude reflected in this verdict, one might wonder why they label the pamphlet merely "probable" in the Bibliography. The case for Defoe's authorship of Reasons against Fighting and A Further Search is strengthened, Furbank and Owens argue, by circumstantial evidence. In a letter to Harley, Defoe seems to promise to write a pamphlet that fits the description of Reasons against Fighting , and there is a similarly suggestive epistolary reference to a work that might be A Further Search. The style of A Further Search , moreover, "has here and there an edge and neat turn of phrase-making that seem reasonably Defoean" (180). 65. The reference is in a 5 June 1712 letter to Harley, where Defoe says that he is enclosing "books," presumably nos. 140(P) and 141 (P), though the references are vague. Of the first, he explains, "It is written without Doores, and for The Use of Those Cheifly, who kno' Nothing but without Doores. I hope it May be Usefull to Undeciev an abused people, and Let Them see How The wholl Nation was Forming into One Tribe of Issachar, and Taught to Couch Under The Tyranny of Our Neighbours." He goes on to explain that he is sending "another book ... in Answer to The Dutch Memorialls." He insists that he is "farr from Exciting the people against The Dutch, and believ it is not the Governments View to Injure or Break with The Dutch; but it Seems Necessary ... to have the Dutch Friends and Not Masters" ( Letters , 376, 377). 66. See note to no. 85. 67. Furbank and Owens say that, "since the persona of 'Count Tariff' was directly associated with Mercator by Addison," this praise "is strongly suggestive of Defoe's authorship" ( CB , 140). 68. As further "evidence," Furbank and Owens explain that Defoe had, in a letter to Harley, encouraged him "to get Steele expelled from Parliament." They conclude that "Out of these circumstantial facts a 'probable' attribution seems to emerge" ( CB , 141). 69. Oldmixon, Remarks on the Letter to the Dissenters , 24. 70. To Harley, Defoe writes, "I have also Compil'd a Letter to The Dissenters, of which I had a hint from your Ldpp" ( Letters , 424). 71. The attribution of items 161, 164(P), 165, 166, 167, 168, 170, 175(P), and 194 are addressed in more detail in Furbank and Owens, "The Lost Property Office: Some Defoe Attributions Reconsidered," PBSA 86 (1992): 245–67. Furbank and Owens sort 24 "Harley" pamphlets attributed to Defoe by Moore into "Defoe's," "probably Defoe's," and unlikely to be Defoe's. They list no. 161 as merely "probable" in this article, and (without explanation) upgrade it to "definite" in CB . 72. Dunton, The Impeachment, or Great Britain's Charge Against the Present M[inistr]y , 24. 73. Boyer, Political State for June 1717. 74. Some people attributed this to Harley; both Harley and Defoe (in an Appeal to Honour and Justice) denied authorship ( CB , 148). Either we disbelieve Defoe's passionate defense of himself or we deprive him of authorship. 75. Defoe explains "why I have not Persued what I was upon for Vindicateing your Ldpps person and Conduct and Exposeing your Enemyes as I had proposed to your Ldpp and which was actually in the Press and part of it Printed off" ( Letters , 444). Furbank and Owens conclude that "it is hard to doubt that this was the promised pamphlet he referred to in a letter to Harley of 3 August 1714" ( CB , 148–49). 76. Pittis (?), Queen Anne Vindicated , 12–15. 77. Furbank and Owens argue that "it is difficult not to conclude that he wrote [this pamphlet] and that it is a work of fiction" ( CB , 151). 78. Read's Weekly Journal for 8 November 1718. 79. In The Life And Strange Surprizing Adventures of Mr. D[aniel] De F[oe] , Gildon has "Defoe" say, "I have written against my old Teachers in the Shape and Form of a Quaker , as in a Pamphlet to T. B. a Dealer in many Words; and in the same Form I have attack'd the B...of B..., one who is equally hated by them" (xv). The "Pamphlet to T. B." is evidently item no. 170, the full tide of which is A Friendly Epistle by way of Reproof from one of the People called Quakers, to Thomas Bradbury, a Dealer in many Words . Nos. 172 and 174 are related to 170 (the title pages of both announce that the work is "By the same Friend that wrote to Thomas Bradbury ), which is presumably why Furbank and Owens use Gildon to support the attribution of these items as well as of no. 170. The same is true for no. 195, attributed on the title page to "a Ministring Friend, who writ to Tho. Bradbury , a Dealer in many Words." Items 172, 174, and 195 are labeled "contemporary attribution" here because Gildon clearly associated Defoe with a group of related pamphlets. 80. Boyer, Political State for June 1717. 81. Furbank and Owens suggest that "the discriminating and provocative tribute to the genius of Louis XIV ... seems particularly characteristic and has many parallels in the Review " ( CB , 160). 82. James Crossley , "Defoe's Pamphlet on the Septennial Bill," Notes and Queries , 1st ser., 5 (1852): 577–579. 83. Defoe's claim appears in an article in the St. James's Post , reprinted in Mercurius Politicus (July 1717). Furbank and Owens explain that "Boyer, in the Political State for April 1716, accuses Defoe of writing an attack on the bill to extend the life of Parliament... and mentions the present tract as one of seven written in favour of the bill and therefore as not by Defoe" ( CB , 164). 84. Boyer, Political State for June 1717. 85. As "most probably" rather than a definite attribution. 86. This variation "is one of many such adaptations of the line by Defoe" ( CB , 167). 87. Furbank and Owens listed this item as a doubtful attribution in Defoe De-Attributions (pp. 95–96), but "new light on Defoe's political stance at this period now inclines us to accept it as probable" ( CB , 171). They also accept the successor to this pamphlet, no. 193(P) (p. 100 in Defoe De-Attributions ). 88. Boyer, Political State for June 1717. As Furbank and Owens point out, "Toland, who was an old enemy of Defoe, went along with the attribution, gleefully exploiting the chance to score off him" ( CB , 170). "Toland, in The Second Part of the State-Anatomy , answered [this pamphlet], making merciless fun of the paradox of the author of The True-Born Englishman (of all people) extolling the English nobility and whipping up prejudice against foreigners" ( CB , 176). Defoe flatly denies authorship of this piece in 193(P), but perhaps disingenuously. 89. The author of The Conduct of Robert Walpole Esq. reports that "Fair Payment no Spunge ... was also said to be written by the Order of the first Contrivers: Some said it was written by the aforesaid Paterson ; others, who pretended to speak from better Information, said it was done by Daniel de Foe " (p. 59; quoted in CB , 172). 90. James Crossley, "'Inquiry into the State of the Union, by the Wednesday Club in Friday Street,"' Notes and Queries , 1st ser., 7 (1853): 576. 91. The piece expresses sentiments similar to those in no. 189; includes a remark also found in nos. 7 and 8; its title may recall no. 148; there are possible reference to no. 148; a "classic Defoe formulation" and a "very Defoean homily." Also, "the absurd prejudice of supposing that anyone who finds things to praise in an enemy must be a traitor [is] frequently echoed in the Review " ( CB , 173). 92. A Presbyterian Getting on Horse-Back , 3–4. From Furbank and Owens's point of view, however, the author of this piece is half wrong: the author says that no. 191(P) must be by the same author as The Repeal of the Act against Occasional Conformity Considered , and "I should suspect De Foe to be the Author." Furbank and Owens do not attribute The Repeal of the Act to Defoe ( CB , 174), which means that we cannot count this contemporary's testimony as reliable external evidence. 93. "Wodrow, in the preface to his The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland , 2 vols (Edinburgh, 1721–22), discusses this work and says that it is generally believed to be by the author of the History of the Union. He makes a more explicit attribution to Defoe in a letter to James Fraser (undated, but about November 1720)" ( CB , 175). 94. "The present tract's denial that Defoe wrote [188(P)] ... carries little conviction in the face of so much external evidence" ( CB , 177). The external evidence to which they refer is presumably the Boyer and Toland attributions of no. 188(P) to Defoe (both hostile). 95. Oldmixon, A Reply to the Late Bishop Atterbury's Vindication , 7. Boyer's statements in the Political State (June 1717) implies that this tract is Defoe's. Defoe replied to Boyer (in a letter signed "D.F." in St James's Post , reprinted in Mercurius Politicus , July 1717), challenging him to "produce some Proof" that he had written it. The Post Boy advertisement attributes it to someone else ( CB , 178). 96. As Furbank and Owens point out, however, Wilson admitted "that there was probably 'no solid foundation' for the attribution" ( CB , 179). 97. "Despite his disclaimers and the Post Boy advertisement the ascription to Defoe is convincing, and one passage in particular helps support the theory that he wrote it and constitutes a complicated private joke" ( CB , 178). 98. See note to no. 170. 100. This piece includes lengthy quotations from no. 20 and cites no. 23; it includes a favorite "dog-Latin tag" of Defoe's ; and its approach is similar to Defoe's known writings (CB, 187). 101. Furbank and Owens do not mention that Gildon attributed this to Defoe in the "postscript" to The Life And Strange Surprizing Adventures of Mr. D[aniel] De F[oe] : "Having just run thro' the first Volume and clos'd my Letter, I was told that the second Volume was at last come out" (29). 102. "There could be thought to be the hint of an attribution to Defoe in a passage from a pamphlet Considerations on the Consequences of the French settling Colonies on the Mississippi excerpted in the Political State for April 1720: '... all your heavy Fellows, who pass for wise ... have thought it the shortest Way [our italics] to tell us gravely it will certainly come to nothing, and to treat it as a meer Chimaera ' [our italics]" ( CB, 191). They point out that passages from The Chimera (206(P)) had been reprinted in the Political State the previous January. 103. As Furbank and Owens point out, "Defoe claimed more than once to have ... a manuscript by an English gentleman who served under Gustavus Adolphus" ( CB, 194). 104. Furbank and Owens suggest that Noble's 1784 edition of Captain Singleton "is, perhaps, the first ascription of it to Defoe" ( CB, 196). I have found additional evidence suggested a significantly earlier first attribution: a 17 67 edition of Captain Singleton sold by Francis Noble (and others) is advertised as "Published originally from the Captain's Manuscript, by the celebrated Daniel Defoe ." See The London Chronicle, 23–25 June 1767. The tide page of this edition (labeled the "third") says 1768, but the advertisement announces it as appearing on that day. 105. Jonathan E. Hill , " Defoe's Singleton ?" PBSA 84 (1990): 285–296. 106. The connection with Defoe is, however, tenuous. The appearance of this verse passage in the Review is sixteen years earlier than the publication of The Case of Mr Law , and the same passage is quoted at p. 22 of A Letter from a Gentleman at the Bath, to his Friend in London (1722), a work never associated with Defoe . 107. This attribution was made by Crossley in a letter to the Gentleman's Magazine 10 (1838): 370–371. 108. Every Man Mind his Own Business, 10. 109. Furbank and Owens point out that "Several passages from the Tour are reproduced without acknowledgment in ... Atlas Maritimus (1728)" ( CB, 210–211)—an illustration of the fact that the appearance of passages from a " Defoe " work does not constitute solid evidence for an item's authorship. 110. J. R. Forster , History of Voyages ... Made in the North (1786); Noble's edition of Daniel De Foe's Voyage Round the World (1787). 111. Furbank and Owens argue that Defoe was suspected of being Moreton in his lifetime, citing the anonymous Villany Exploded (1728) as an example ( CB, 214). I have, however, found no other association of Defoe with Moreton in his lifetime. In the "Cibber" list of 1753, Shiels includes nos. 233 (as "History of Magic") and 238, the latter as "under the name of Moreton," but does not attribute the other Moreton pamphlets to Defoe (see p. 323). Chalmers (1790) included 233 and 238 as Defoe's (pp. 82, 83), but he regarded the other "Moreton" works (nos. 222, 232, 241, 243, and 245) as merely "supposed to be De Foe's " (see p. 86). Nos. 233 and 238 are not in fact part of the Moreton series, as Furbank and Owens point out, but 238 was reissued (as The Secrets of the Invisible World Disclos'd) with "Andrew Moreton" on the title page, and a second edition of 233 also includes that name ( CB, 213). 112. As Furbank and Owens point out, Trent "cites a manuscript note [dated 1759] in one of his copies: 'I was told by Mr. Bowles , print-seller ... that it was composed by Daniel Defoe "' ( CB, 220). 113. The piece includes a favorite allusion; a reference that appears in no. 227; a claim also made in no. 223; and a line of verse also in no. 233. 114. Furbank and Owen note that an abridgment entitled Chickens feed Capons (1731 [for 1730]) reproduced some of no. 232, though they doubt Defoe 's participation in or authorization of it. 115. Items included in the Critical Bibliography chiefly because they are continuations of earlier " Defoe " works are labeled here "deduced-context." 236(P) is "deduced from content" because both it and the work to which it is connected are attributed on the grounds of internal evidence. 116. A 30 January 1705 letter to "The Select Committee of the House of Lords" is printed in Letters (pp. 73-77). The author of no. 242(P), Furbank and Owens explain, gives "an approving account of a similar long and intricate proposal 'laid before a Committee of Parliament' some years ago" ( CB, 234). 117. Furbank and Owens retain Some Objections as a "probable" attribution, while de-attributing two other pamphlets on imprisonment for debt (all three were treated as certain by Moore). See "Defoe and Imprisonment for Debt: Some Attributions Reviewed," The Review of English Studies, n.s., 37 (1986): 495-502. 118. Furbank and Owens point out that "There was much anonymous verse, in the main most probably by Defoe himself" in the Review [CB, 244). They also explain that "Occasionally, Defoe reprinted previously published pamphlets in the Review. ... More usually, though, articles from or issues of the Review were reprinted as pamphlets. It is often difficult to tell whether this was done with Defoe's authorisation or not" (245). 119. On which see J. A. Downie , " Mr. Review and His Scribbling Friends: Defoe and the Critics, 1705-1706," Huntington Library Quarterly 41 (1978): 345-366. 120. As, for example, in the Review for 30 January 1707, where he insists "no Person whatsoever has or ever had any Concern in writing the said Paper Entitled the REVIEW, than the known Author D. F. "... and that "wherever the Author may be, the Papers are wrote with his own Hand." 121. Narcissus Luttrell reports that "de Foe is ordered to be taken into custody for reflecting on admiral Rooke, in his Master Mercury" (quoted in CB, 249). 122. Boyer 's ascription is in the Political State for May 1713. Furbank and Owens point out that "Various suggestions were made as to the authorship of Mercator" (CB, 250). 123. In the Review, Furbank and Owens report, Defoe "speaks as if the Mercator were by another author," and in An Appeal to Honour and Justice, he admits to having some part in it, but insists that he "neither was the Author of it, had the Property of it, the Printing of it, or the Profit by it." In a cryptic passage in a 21 May 1714 letter to Harley, Defoe seems to claim sole authorship (see Letters, 441). 124. The Flying-Post for 26-29 June 1714 includes criticism of the Monitor: ...you are to remember, that if D.F. be the Author (as 'tis generally suppos'd) he is famous for Irony ..." (CB, 252). 125. One issue includes a story for which there are "several analogues ... in known Defoe writings"; another issue includes a discussion of Steele very similar to one in a letter to Harley . A passage in yet another issue "corresponds closely, and at one point word-for-word, with a letter of Defoe's to Harley on the same subject" (CB, 252-253). 126. A passage in the 5 August 1720 Commentator (255(P)) attributes The Manufacturer to "Daniel" (CB, 254). 127. "An attack on [The Commentator] in the Weekly Medley for 16-23 January 1720 ('composed equally of Ignorance and Malice, and like a common FOE to all ingenious and learned men') might be hinting at Defoe as author" (CB, 255). 128. This paper includes several parallels to other Defoe writings: an anecdote used in no. 216 and another used in the Review; a quotation from no. 34; a comment very similar to one in no. 267 and the Review; a bit of wordplay paralleled in no. 224; a discussion akin to one in the Review; a Rochester quotation also found in the Review; and a discussion of credit that "is very much in Defoe's style upon this favourite topic." One issue includes an epigraph similar to the opening lines of no. 271 (CB, 256). 129. Printed in Gildon, History of the Athenian Society. 130. Dunton , Life and Errors, 240. 131. "The letter was declared treasonable, as a result of which Mist's offices were raided and searched and the staff taken into custody; and under questioning Mist testified that the letter was the work of Defoe , as did the bookseller Thomas Warner and a certain Jonathan Marshall , who said it had been delivered to him by Defoe's gardener" (CB, 259–60). 132. "The Universal Spectator was edited by Defoe 's son-in-law Henry Baker , and in his set of copies of this journal ... Baker has written Defoe 's name against this essay" (CB, 260). 133. See J. A. Downie , "'Mistakes on all Sides': A New Defoe Manuscript," The Review of English Studies, n.s., 27 (1976): 431-437. 134. The piece is known "from a transcript, headed 'De-Foe's Satyr' by George Staniland ... in a letter to an unknown recipient, dated 11 May 1709" (CB, 266). LINES PER PAGE, ENGRAVINGS, AND CATCHWORDS IN MILTON’S 1720 POETICAL WORKS By Hao Tianhu * John Milton’s Poetical Works published by Jacob Tonson II in 1720 is an important edition, not the least because Richard Bentley , "the greatest ever English classical scholar," 1 adopted it as the working copy for his "notorious" 2 1732 edition of Paradise Lost. This lavish pair of large quarto volumes (with main sections of 590 and 527 pages respectively) included many engraved tailpieces, which placed special demands on the compositors. By analyzing material traces seldom examined—such as lines of text per page—we can infer with reasonable certainty how they operated. Along the way we may provide a rationale for some of the catchword errors 3 by connecting these inconsistencies with the printing and publishing of the book, especially illustration. The Tonsons were well known for publishing deluxe books. William Thomas Lowndes , an eminent bibliographer of the early nineteenth century, defined Caesar’s Commentaries brought out by Jacob Tonson I in 1712 as "the most sumptuous classical work which England has produced." 4 The 1720 Milton is typically adorned with rich illustrations. Engraved vignettes open and conclude each of the books of Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained and the tragedy Samson Agonistes , finely framing the grand poems in pictorial art. Additionally, the first item in Poems, Lycidas, has a special headpiece. These thirty-five vignettes, plus eighteen historiated initials, help produce what Marcia R. Pointon calls "a splendid and expensive edition rather in the manner of the Venetian illustrated book of the * Now teaching at Peking University, I am deeply indebted to Professor David Scott Kastan and Professor G. Thomas Tanselle for their teaching during my Columbia years (1999-2006), out of which this essay grows.

Other printing errors are present in this edition as well. For instance, in vol. 1, the signatures on p. 33 and p. 35 should be "F" and "F2", but were missigned as "E" and "E2"; on 3M1 r the pagination "449" was misprinted as "447"; the line number "620" on p. 483 was misplaced beside line 621. This note, however, focuses upon the ways that illustration affects typography. 4. Quoted in George Francis Papali , Jacob Tonson , Publisher: His Life and Work (1656-1736) ( Auckland , New Zealand : Tonson Publishing House, 1968), facing 116. period." 5 R. G. Moyles , another modern scholar, confirms it as "impressively beautiful ... a much-coveted book." 6 Pointon compares Louis Chéron , the illustrator responsible for most of the decorations in the edition, unfavorably with John Baptist Medina, another early illustrator of Milton, but still admits that " Chéron’s illustrations are nearly always more skillfully composed than Medina’s and [that] the tailpieces and historiated initials make for a much richer general effect." 7 The list of 334 subscribers in volume 1 indicates that the costly book was eagerly sought after by aristocratic and elite readers (dukes, duchesses, earls, lords, sirs, esquires, doctors, ladies, and the like). 8 Clearly Tonson strived to meet the aesthetic demands of his prominent customers. The paper used (printing medium, 585 x 455 mm) makes a large and handsome object, and the 22-line page adds much elegance. Our count of lines of poetic text on a typical full page excludes the headline and the direction-line. The standard number of lines is 22, with occasional variations of 21 or 23. When a 23rd line occurs it crowds the page and sometimes includes both part of the text and a catchword. But this additional line occurs only in less important works—in Addison’s Notes in volume 1, and in Poems in volume 2, beginning toward the end of A Mask . 9 All the major poems, Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, Samson Agonistes, and Lycidas, which are pictorially ornamented, contain no crowded pages. The different typographical treatment of the minor works and the major poems is dictated by, and also registers, the hierarchical status of the two categories of text. The publisher’s typographical intervention participates imperceptibly yet actively in the reception of the author and the construction of textual meaning. The 21-line pages occur in the major works, as table 1 shows. These typographical irregularities can be explained by aesthetic necessities. The plate mark of the vignette at the end of a book usually occupies a space of ten lines or more. Thus we find some pages toward the end of a book or poem composed in 21 lines, to avoid the awkward situation either of a section closing on a page with insufficient space left for the tailpiece or of the tailpiece being printed alone (with no text) on a separate page. In all the above sections, the normal 22-line pages would lead to such an awkward situation, and the spatial demand of the tailpiece required the reduction of some pages to 21 lines ( Lycidas is an exception; see below). At the same time, the compositors also had to take care not to add too many lines of text to the pages containing tailpieces, lest an image not fit between the text and the catchword. The hazard is evident at the end of Book VII of Paradise Lost, 2R1 r (1.305) and at the end of Samson Agonistes, 2C3 r (2.197), where the image of the engraving barely fits between the printed 5.

The resumption of the 22-line page at 3M2 r (1.451), though unnecessary (because the next page, which contains the tailpiece, has enough space for another line), shows this same concern about squeezing the engraved image. But except in Book III of Paradise Regained and in Samson Agonistes the compositors did not take particular care to start 21-line page groups on versos so that facing pages would have the same number of lines and produce a better visual effect. Still, aesthetic considerations significantly affect the physical production of this book; through the material traces extant we may discover the modus operandi of an important early-eighteenth-century printing house. This insight into the practices of compositors also explains how a strange catchword error occurred. Since there are relatively few catchword disruptions given the size of these large volumes, the anomalies stand out all the more. In addition to the coincidence of the direction-line and the last line of the text mentioned above, we also observe the following unexpected situations: (1) the differences that occur between books in Paradise Lost, in some cases the catchword on the last page of a book of Paradise Lost signals the head title, rather than the section title, of the next book; 10 (2) spelling variations; 11 (3) a large number of punctuation discrepancies; 12 (4) omissions, which are mostly "The Argument" 10. Vol. 1: F4 v , S1 r , 2M4 r , 2R1 r , 2X2 r PARA-[THE]. Vol. 2: 2G4 r MASK [A] belongs to the same category, for the article is likewise rejected in preference for the head title. My description of catchword disruptions is made in general accordance with Fredson Bowers’s guidelines in his classic Principles of Bibliographic Description (1949; repr. with introduction by G. Thomas Tanselle , Winchester: St Paul’s Bibliographies, 1994), 299-300. The actual catchword appears first, followed in brackets by the first word of the next page. 11.

But two others, both in volume 2, are noteworthy: F4 r (p. 39), Of [Twice,]; 2E1 r (p. 209), And [Now]. In the latter case, "And" is not only the catchword but also the first word of the final line on that page: "And wipe the Tears for ever from his eyes." This page contains 21 lines and is the second to last for Lycidas (pp. 201-210); the preceding pages 202-208 are all normal 22-line ones. It may be inferred that this catchword error resulted from a problem in casting off the copy. The "And ..." line, originally intended for p. 210, had to be relocated to the preceding page to fill the space, but the catchword was not changed accordingly. In the other instance, "Of" begins the second line on the next page (F4 v ). Presumably the first line on F4 v , "Twice, by a voice inviting him to eat;", had been composed (or planned?) as the last line of F4 r . Then the need for 21-line pages (see the table) was realized, so this line was removed from the page and reset as the first line on the next page, with the original catchword left untouched. The position of F4 r as the very first 21-line page in the volume enhances the plausibility of this explanation; the compositor stumbled unexpectedly, then noted the problem and did not repeat the mistake. My record of catchword disruptions shows this to be a revised form of the original lineation. For my discussion I have examined only the Columbia University Library copy and the British Library copy (the latter is available in ECCO), which agree at this point. A census of all extant copies might discover instances of the originally planned arrangement (in which the 22-line F4 r ends with the line "Twice ..." and the appropriate catchword "Of") or of a fully corrected combination (in which F4 r consists of 21 lines, the catchword is "Twice," and the first line on the next page is "Twice ..."). 15 13.

In vol. 1, the commas in 3F1 r "Omniscient," and 3K2 v "Insensible," appear half x-height higher than their normal position (the ones in the British Library copy are in normal position); in vol. 2, the "o" of catchword "so" on 2S3 r is turned ninety degrees and appears half x-height lower than its normal position (the letter is in normal position in the British Library copy); the catchword on 3P2 r "Aurea" has turned "a". 15. In addition to the Columbia copy and the British Library copy, the copies at the University of Cambridge, Harvard University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Leeds, the National Library of Scotland, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Stanford University, and the University of Toronto share the same catchword error, i.e. "Of" on F4 r of vol. 2 (among other copies, the ones at CUNY, USC, and Yale are reported to be missing). I am very grateful to Professor Chen Xiaoling , Ms. Ding Yanyuan , Professor David Kastan , Ms. Li Ling , Dr. Li Yaochung , Ms. Liu Nian , Professor Axel E. W. Müller , Dr. Na Hai , Ms. Peng Xiuling , Professor Shen Hong , Dr. Wang Yuanfei , Dr. Xu Hongxia , Ms. Yang Bin , and Mr. Yang Renren for their kind assistance in the check of respective copies. John Shawcross records "a reissue of the 1720 edition in private hands, the only copy reported" ("Commercialism," 64). I did write Professor Shawcross attempting to locate this unique copy, but after my email bounced I was sorry to find that the senior Miltonist had passed away in March 2011. Overall, then, careful attention to a frequently overlooked physical feature of a book, the number of lines per page, provides insight into the way that workers three centuries ago dealt with some everyday challenges of their craft. In Tonson’s 1720 edition of Milton’s poetry this scrutiny shows us how the compositors accommodated the presence of engraved ornaments, while it also helps us understand how small inconsistencies, here with catchwords, arose in the course of their labors. OFFSET EVIDENCE IN EDWARD YOUNG’S THE CENTAUR NOT FABULOUS 1755) by James E. May * This paper examines offset (sometimes called "set off") principally on the sixteen leaves that were cancelled or printed in partial gatherings for the first edition of Edward Young’s prose satire and homily The Centaur Not Fabulous (1755), printed by Samuel Richardson . Besides the frontispiece, the edition has the following partial gatherings and cancellantia: a confusing nine-leaf B gathering; two cancellans folds in the text, N1.N2 and R1.R2 (with parts of Letters III and V); half-sheet Cc 4 ; and four singletons: title-leaf A1, final leaf Dd1, and cancellantia B3 (third leaf of the preface) and U1. In another article I have demonstrated where those leaves were imposed in relation to one another on three printed units. 1 I placed leaves A1, B3, U1, and Ddi on a sheet shared by Cc 4 (with A 1 and U1 adjoining at their heads and with their fore-edges lying at the end of the sheet, Dd1 conjugate to A1, and B3 conjugate to U1). I identified cancellantia folds B2.B7 + 1 and B6.B7 as printed as a half-sheet either through work-and-turn or with four other leaves to form a whole sheet (with B2 and B6 adjoining at their heads), and cancellantia N1.N2 and R1.R2 as running laterally across a separate whole sheet as N1.N2.R2.R1. The work thus has the following collation formula: 8°: (frt +) A 1 B 8 (-B2, B3, B6, B7; B1 + X 4 , with X2-4 between B5 and B8 [appearing as B6, B7, B7 + 1]; x1 + 2 X1 [‘B3’]) C-M 8 N 8 (-N1,N2; + ’N1’.N2 [= 3 X 8 — 6 leaves, including ‘R1’.R2]) O-Q 8 R 8 (-R1,R2; +’R1’.R2 [= 3 x 8 —6 leaves, including ‘N1’.N2]) S-T 8 U 8 (± ‘U1’) X-Bb 8 Cc 4 Dd1; $1-4 (-N2, R2) signed; cancellans X1 and 2 X1 missigned ‘B2’ and ‘B3’; 200 leaves; pp. [ 4 (frontispiece and title-page)], i-xvi, [ 2 (section title)], 1 2-53 54-56 57-221 222-224 225-378. [ Note. The reconstruction creates a Cc 8 sheet containing leaves A1, B3, U1, and Dd1 positioned as follows: A1 =Cc3, B3 = Cc7, * Many librarians answered questions about copies, some kindly providing reproductions, among whom I wish to particularly thank Jeffrey Barr , Margaret Foley , Melissa Mead , John Mustain , Richard Noble , and Bruce Swann . I thank my eldest son, Erich May, for help inspecting copies, Shef Rogers for suggesting that I use gloss the word "offset" with "set off" and employ the term "bleed-through," and David Vander Meulen for advice on recording offset and for much rephrasing, correction, and regularization. 1. "Interrelating the Cancellantia and Partial Gatherings in the First Edition of Edward Young’s The Centaur Not Fabulous ," Studies in Bibliography, 53 (2000), 241-263; hereafter cited as "Interrelating the Cancellantia." U1 =Cc2, and Dd1 =Cc6, with the leaf signed ‘Cc2’ occurring in the position of Cc4.] After a disjunct frontispiece (printed separately) and a title leaf comes B1, conjugate to a section title that had been B8 prior to the cancellations and insertions in gathering B; then the cancel B2 conjugate to B7 + 1; then a disjunct B3 printed with A1, U1, and the final leaf Dd1; then the fold B4.B5 from the original B gathering; then a cancellans fold B6.B7; and then B7 + 1 and the section title B8. In addition, I showed that all leaves printed on the same sheet or half-sheet regularly ended up in the same copy. I supported this collation formula with evidence from press figures, watermarks, tranchefiles, and chain-lines in dozens of trimmed copies and confirmed it with additional evidence from the point holes and leaf dimensions of the untrimmed copy at St. John’s College, Cambridge. In this article, while confirming with new evidence what I formerly argued about the cancellantia and partials of The Centaur, I will demonstrate the utility of offset evidence in reconstructing the pattern of imposition. For instance, the offset evidence will corroborate that all four singletons were printed at the same time within a sheet with Cc 4 . Offset from the cancellanda will also provide information about Young’s revisions, offering some variant textual readings. In addition, the analysis will offer insights into the printing, folding, and assembling of sheets of this edition in Richardson’s shop. It will, for example, indicate the extent to which these activities were handled consistently while also revealing interesting exceptions, as when the leaves for diverse gatherings were folded together before they were cut apart. So far as these insights involve only a single edition from one press the account is anecdotal, but the results are worth reporting because offset has not often been discussed in bibliographical literature. Finally, I make observations and raise questions about the nature, or behavior, of offset ink impressions. Only a handful of arguments have been offered from offset evidence. 2 I have seen no study involving as many copies or cancels as this conducted for The Centaur, nor any study attending to the diverse folding of sheets, half-sheets, and quarter-sheets with partials and cancellantia. The Centaur is a good subject for studying offset both because it is a common book well printed by a good and orderly printing shop and because much is known from correspondence between Richardson and Young about the order in which sheets went through the press. One is sometimes amazed, even irritated, by the backwards letter-press on the pages of eighteenth-century books, especially in photocopies. Some of that, particularly noticeable on thin paper, is "bleed-through," the seeping of ink from the other side of the leaf. In The Centaur, a well-printed book not prone to offset, one sees more bleed-through than offset, not only within and between regular sheets but in most pages of the partials and cancellantia. But some of the extrane- 2.

In particular, the backwards inking in a margin of a page will often be offset rather than bleed-through. The two situations can often be distinguished by color: offset, with this and other Richardson editions at least, has a yellowish-brown tint (e.g., B7 + 1 r on [&gt;] B2 v of the ViWCF copy; see Appendix i for library codes). That tint often seems the stronger when the offset is from facing pages (e.g., exchanges between B3 v /B4 r and B5 v /B6 r in NcU and B5 v /B6 r in ViWCF). Offset ink was transferred when sheets were folded, collated, stacked, compressed, and pounded at the printer’s and the binder’s shops. 3 Of course, even after a book has been bound, offset often will be transferred to facing pages. This timing is especially evident when facing text appears on blank endpapers (e.g., offset from the final verso of The Centaur on the first back endpaper in CtY, LU, Mayi, May3, NNUi, PSt, ViWCF) or on inserted papers, especially when the leaves have been moistened. The capacity for offset transfer after binding is shown by the O-HF copy where, after the top outside corners of B5 and B6 were dog-eared, B5 r received offset from B7 r , and B6 v received offset from itself. The cancellantia and partial gatherings in thirty-six of the sixty-nine copies of The Centaur that I have examined do not have this additional inking (other than from the frontispiece). But thirty-three copies, nearly half, do have a page or more of offset from pages that do not face them in the bound book. 4 Four Singletons and Half-Sheet Cc 4 Most of the offset impressed onto the singletons A 1, U1, B3, and Dd1 is from another singleton or a leaf of half-sheet Cc 4 . Furthermore, all the evidence offered by these copies is consistent with the singletons’ having been printed with Cc 4 in the following arrangement of page settings: Outer forme A1 r Dd1 v Cc3 r Cc2 v U1 v B3 r Cc4 v Cc1 r Inner forme Cc2 r Cc3 v Dd1 r A1 v Cc1 v Cc4 r B3 v U1 r The folds Cc1.Cc4 and Cc2.Cc3 occupy the positions normally occupied in an octavo sheet by 1.8 and 4.5, ensuring that, when detached, two folds left the 3. For an account of the handling of the printed sheets from the press through their being bound, see Philip Gaskell , A New Introduction to Bibliography (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972), pp. 143-148. Gaskell’s account, as we will soon see, does not entirely fit the history of this edition, for sheets were separately folded to octavo size and collated into stacks for individual copies while still at the printer’s shop, an activity Gaskell places at the bindery. 4. Of sixty-nine copies examined, I noted no offset present in and from cancels and partials except between facing pages or the frontispiece in thirty-six copies: BirmU, C, CaOTU (only frt r &lt;B7 + 1 v ), CLU, CLU-C (only frt r &lt;B7 + 1 v ), CoU, Csj, CSmH, E, ICN2, L (only frt r &lt;Dd1 v ), May1, May5, MH1, MH2 (frt r &lt;B7 + 1 v ), MiU, MoU, MR1, MR3, NcU, NeU, NNU2, NStBU, O (frt r &lt;B7 + 1 v ), Oa, OAshU, Occ, OCiU, OCU, O-HF, Ose, OTH, PSt, TnU (only frt r &lt;B7 + 1 v ), TxU, WU. In addition, five copies, starred in the list of copy locations in Appendix i as having offset, aside from exchanges with the frt, have only one exchange between a page of the cancels and partials with another leaf: MdBJ (U1 v &lt;B3 r ); N (B5 v &lt;B7 r ); NBiSU (Pi r &gt;&lt;Dd1 v [also: frt r &lt;08 v ]); Ok ( A 1 r &lt;Cc4 v ); and WNs (P1 r &gt;Dd1 v ). half-sheet ready to be bound. The arrangement of the singletons’ half-sheet is not entirely arbitrary, for it ensured that A 1 r could be folded face up on the top with Dd1 on the bottom or that A 1 r could be protected within the fold under leaf U1, that all four rectos would be normally placed as rectos on the folded halfsheet, and, that, as in other gatherings, the first leaves of A and U often held the watermark and a tranchefile. As does other evidence, the offset inking patterns indicate that the singletons were printed in this arrangement and that they shared as described a full sheet with half-sheet Cc 4 . Those who wish to understand and to test the following observations and inferences are encouraged to take sheets of 8½ X 11" paper, label the leaves as indicated above, and fold them as separated half-sheets or whole sheets as indicated above and below. To arrive at these conclusions, let us first establish that the singletons were on a half-sheet in the pattern described. To judge from the evident offset in copies examined, the half-sheet with singletons was sometimes separated and sometimes not separated from half-sheet Cc prior to folding, but, most often, as will be discussed below, the halves were separated first. This cut would save the labor of unfolding the sheet to separate the halves later. A separated half-sheet’s first fold could be in four directions (either side could be folded forwards or backwards along its long or short axis). The most common fold for the half-sheet with singletons, usually done after the separation into half-sheets, was to bend the outer forme (that with A 1 v ) inward along the short axis, reducing by half the longer dimension of the half-sheet. This fold brought the paired leaves A 1 v and U1 v as well as B3 t and Dd1 v face to face, while leaving the pairs joined at their top edges. It accounts for combinations of offset found on two sets of facing pages in at least sixteen copies. (See Appendix 2 for a full list of offset examples identified.) Pages A 1 v and U1 v exchange offset reciprocally in fourteen copies, while B3 r and Dd1 v do so in nine of the same copies, and ten overall. Several instances of offset occur in only one direction on these pages. Three times B3 r shows up on Dd1 v , and Dd1 v appears once on B3 r , A 1 r once on U1 v , and U1 v once on A 1 r . When, as a separated half-sheet, this once-folded unit was folded a second time, A1 v and Dd1 r or B3 v and U1 r would have been brought face to face. The former fold led to an exchange of offset between A1 v and Dd1 r in CtY, FU, May3, and LdU-B (reciprocal in CtY, May3, and LdU-B), and allowed U1 r , now on the outside, to exchange offset with Cc4 v as occurred reciprocally in CtY, May3 and FU. The latter fold led to an exchange of offset between B3 v and U1 r in LU, MR2, NRU, and Ob. Presumably B3 v and U1 r were brought face to face in the NRU copy also, for its A 1 v received offset from Cc1 r and its Dd1 r received offset from Bb8 v . If the unfolded half-sheet as described above was folded the opposite direction along the short axis, such that the inner forme was folded inward, then pairs A 1 v and U 1 r and B 3 v and Dd 1 r would exchange offset. This folding occurred in DLC, ICN 1 , OAU, and RPB copies. In DLC and OAU, both A 1 v /U 1 r and Dd 1 r /B 3 v reciprocally exchanged offset, and in ICN 1 and RPB A 1 v has U 1 r ’s offset and B 3 v and Dd 1 r reciprocally exchanged offset. If this folded half-sheet were folded a second time, it would result in offset exchanged either by A 1 r and Dd 1 v or by U 1 v and B 3 r . The latter fold occurred in DLC, ICN 1 , OAU, and RPB, where U 1 v and B 3 r exchanged offset. In DLC and RPB, A 1 r , left on the outside, exchanged offset with Cc 4 v (Dd 1 v lacks offset in both copies, and in both the frontispiece was stored between Bb8 v and Cc 1 r ). In OAU, A 1 v and Bb8 v reciprocally exchanged offset, as did Dd 1 v and Cc 1 r . Folding a half-sheet along the long axis certainly was not the common practice, but it happened surprisingly often. If the inner forme were folded inward along the long axis, then offset would be exchanged both between A 1 v and Dd 1 r and between B 3 v and U 1 r . This, in fact, happened to the half-sheet at CaOHM where A 1 v has offset from Dd 1 r , and B 3 v and U 1 r reciprocally exchanged offset. If a second fold occurred, it would place either A 1 r against U 1 v or Dd 1 v against B 3 r . In CaOHM the former is also seen: U 1 v has A 1 r ’s offset. The three offset exchanges in the CaOHM half-sheet could not arise from any manner of folding the half-sheet first along the short axis. If the outer forme of the singletons’ half-sheet were folded inward along the long axis, then offset would be exchanged between A 1 r and Dd 1 v and between U 1 v and B 3 r . The evidence for this fold involves both pairs of conjugate leaves in the NIC and NjP copies, where reciprocal offset exchanges occur between A 1 r and Dd 1 v and B 3 r and U 1 v . A second fold would place Dd 1 r against B 3 v or Al v against U 1 r . The former fold occurred to the NIC copy: Dd 1 r and B 3 v reciprocally exchanged offset, which left U 1 r on the outside of the folded unit, where it received offset from Cc 4 v . In NjP, there appears to be offset of a short catchword probably beginning "th" on A 1 v , suggesting that it was on the exterior, with B 3 v and Dd 1 r folded against each other. Just as for the CaOHM copy, so for the NIC and NjP copies no other fold but initially along the long axis can explain the offset pattern. It seems unlikely that the initial fold of the half-sheets with the singletons was regularly along the long axis, for folding along the short axis to reduce the longer dimension at each step is the easier practice since it reduces arm work by reducing the size of the unit worked on. Furthermore, it is the conventional practice in folding a half-sheet like Cc 4 into a unit ready to be bound. The preference for reducing the longest dimension by folding it at the short axis is apparent in those copies where the singletons and half-sheet Cc 4 were folded together as an uncut sheet. Nevertheless, in three copies offset is recorded as exchanged between both leaf pairs facing across from one another along the singletons’ half-sheet’s long axis (NIC and NjP folding inner forme inward [ A 1 v against Dd 1 r , U 1 r against B 3 v ]; and CaOHM folding outer forme inward [ A 1 r against Dd 1 v , U 1 v against B 3 1 ]). Still, this long fold involves but relatively few copies with offset, for exchanges on multiple pairs of leaves and other evidence suggest at least twelve copies were cut into half sheets and then folded along the short axis ( A 1 against U 1 and Dd 1 against B 3 ). 5 On several occasions the singleton half-sheet was cut into quarter-sheets before being folded. This alone can explain the anomalous offset in the CSt and Owo copies. In Owo Dd 1 r ’s offset is on A 1 v , and U 1 v ’s exchanged reciprocally with B 3 r . Thus, the inner forme was folded inward in the first pair, but the outer forme was folded inward in the second. Since there is no evidence of resetting and reimposition, this pattern indicates that the half-sheet was cut into folds A 1 .Dd 1 and U 1 .B 3 before each was separately folded. These separate folds left A 1 r and B 3 v on the exteriors, and, stacked together, A 1 r and B 3 v received each other’s offset. In CSt the offset shows that, after cutting, A 1 .D 1 , B 3 .U 1 , and Cc 4 were folded separately and stacked together. Offset exchanges indicate that both A 1 v .Dd 1 r and U 1 v .B 3 r were folded inward. Pages A 1 r and B 3 v , both on the outside of their folds, exchanged offset. And U 1 r , also an exterior page, received Cc 4 v ’s offset. (This three-unit stack had Dd 1 v and Cc 1 r on the outside, neither receiving offset.) Offset evidence also corroborates that the singletons and the leaves of Cc 4 , in positions defined above, were printed on a full sheet. The best evidence of offset exchanged within a full sheet occurs in the BrP, InU, KU, May 2 , May 4 , MB, and O-EF copies, either folded as a whole sheet prior to cutting in half or folded as if still uncut. In these seven copies the inner-forme pages of the singletons’ half-sheet bear offset from the inner forme of half-sheet Cc 4 . In May 2 and MB all of the eight page-settings of the inner forme exchanged offset, resulting in the following pattern (bold indicates pages as actually printed; regular font indicates offset on those pages): A 1 v Dd 1 r Cc 3 v Cc 2 r Cc 2 r Cc 3 v Dd 1 r A 1 v Cc 1 v Cc 4 r B 3 v U 1 r U 1 r B 3 v Cc 4 r Cc 1 v In InU and May 4 seven of the eight pages in this forme received similar offset: the InU copy only lacks offset of A 1 v on Cc 2 r , and May 4 does not have offset of 5. Some evidence for the long folding of both the singleton and Cc 4 half-sheets is offered by CaAEU: U 1 v has B 3 r ’s offset on the outer forme and Dd 1 r has Cc 3 v ’s offset on the inner forme. If the whole sheet were not cut, this pattern could occur in two ways: the inner forme folded in half along the short axis, placing Cc 3 v against Dd 1 r , and then the half-sized sheet folded along the long axis inward on the outer forme of the singletons’ half, placing B 3 r against U 1 v and leaving the outer forme of Cc 4 on the outside; or with three folds, accordion-like: with pages A 1 r and U 1 v on the far left folded inward atop Dd 1 v and B 3 r , and Cc 2 v and Cc 1 r on the far right folded inward atop Cc 3 r and Cc 4 v , and then the half-sheet-sized unit folded backward to place Cc 3 v against Dd 1 r and Cc 4 r against B 3 v . However, after a third fold this sheet would not be very serviceably folded for later separation and use. The alternative is to suppose the sheet was cut in half, the singletons’ half folded inward along the long axis, placing B 3 r against U 1 v , and then folding U 1 r against A 1 v , leaving Dd 1 r on the outside to receive Cc 3 v ’s offset when the singletons’ half was slipped inside folded half-sheet Cc 4 or when Dd 1 r was stacked against an incorrectly folded Cc 4 with Cc 3 v on the exterior of the folded unit. In either case this pattern cannot be explained by a common efficient folding of the sheet or its half-sheets. B 3 v on Cc 4 r . Six of the eight pages bear offset in the KU and BrP copies. In the KU copy, Cc 2 r and Cc 3 v do not carry offset, but they have transferred it to A 1 v and Dd 1 r respectively. BrP has all the exchanges caused by this fold except, back and forth, between B 3 v and Cc 4 r . O-EF has offset from the outermost leaves: A 1 v has Cc 2 r ’s offset and U 1 r has Cc 1 v ’s. In six copies (BrP, InU, KU, May 2 , MB, and O-EF) the half-sheet with the singletons carries an offset exchange between the outer forme of the half-sheet ( A 1 r with U 1 v and Dd 1 v with B 3 r ; reciprocal in BrP, InU KU and May 2 ; only reciprocal on the former pair in May 4 and MB; and only on the latter in O-EF). This offset was exchanged as the result of a second fold: the sheet was folded such that the outer forme of the singleton half was bought down upon itself. The offset on the outer forme thus has the following pattern (bold indicates regularly printed pages; regular font indicates offset on those pages): U 1 v B 3 r A 1 r Dd 1 v Cc 3 r Cc 2 v U 1 v B 3 r Cc 4 v Cc 1 r A 1 r Dd 1 v This second fold would then have been followed by a third one. No offset indicates the direction of this fold, but it is likely to have been conventional in bringing Cc 2 v against Cc 3 r instead of Cc 1 r against Cc 4 v . Other patterns of offset likewise provide evidence that the four singletons and the Cc 4 half-sheet were printed together. The offset patterns in the seven copies just noted could have occurred were the whole sheet not cut before folding. Whatever advantages might accrue to that procedure, a disadvantage was that time would have to be spent unfolding the unit later. It is therefore not surprising that the offset patterns in most copies indicate that the printed sheet was first cut in half and then the half-sheets were folded separately. One such pattern is evident in copies CaOHM, NIC, and NjP: here offset shows that the group of four singletons was folded along the long axis of the unit and then, in CaOHM and NIC, across the short axis. (The first fold results in these pairings of offset: A 1 v /Dd 1 r , B 3 v /U 1 r [CaOHM]; A 1 r /Dd 1 v , B 3 r /U 1 v [NIC, NjP]. In CaOHM the second fold yields A 1 r /U 1 v ; in NIC, B 3 v /Dd 1 r .) The second fold and resulting offset could not have occurred without the full sheet first having been cut in half. Another pattern of offset exchanged between pages of the two half-sheets likewise shows that the transfer could have occurred only if the half-sheets had first been separated. Except for the seven copies that seem to have been folded as full sheets, offset between the two major sections of the sheet occurs on only a single page of each half-sheet at a time. The particular pairings of pages from each half-sheet can vary, but the extant combinations preclude their having been folded while the singletons were still conjugate with half-sheet Cc 4 . For instance, CtY has offset exchanged between U 1 r (inner forme) and Cc 4 v (outer forme). If the half-sheets were separated, set face to face with U 1 r and Cc 4 v facing each other, and then folded together with the outer forme of the singletons inward so as to transfer offset according to the pattern A 1 r /U 1 v and Dd 1 v /B 3 r (as found in CtY), the resulting quarter-sheet-shaped unit could not be folded again to allow the exchange between A 1 v and Dd 1 r present in the CtY copy (because Cc2.Cc3 would intervene). CtY’s offset exchange between U 1 r and Cc 4 v had to occur after the two half-sheets were twice folded separately; subsequently U 1 r and Cc 4 v , now on the exterior of the folded half-sheets, met when they were stacked. 6 In several copies with this "stacking" evidence the fact that the half-sheets were folded after being separated from each other is further attested by offset transfer within each of the half-sheets. In CtY and May 3 , the half-sheets were first folded in opposite directions: for the singletons half-sheet the outer forme was folded inward (A 1 r /U 1 v ), while for Cc 4 the inner forme was first folded inward (Cc 1 v /Cc 2 r and Cc 3 v /Cc 4 r mutually exchanged much offset). In the second folds, A 1 v and Dd 1 r were brought face to face, as were Cc 2 v and C 2 r ; this positioned U 1 r (from the inner forme) on the outside, where it received offset from Cc 4 v (a page of the outer forme). Cancellantia In Gathering B Although the cancellans folds of the dedication and of the text never exchanged offset, cancellantia B 2 .B 7 + 1 and B6.B 7 exchanged offset among each other as did N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 . Offset evidence confirms what was elsewhere shown ("Interrelating the Cancellantia," 255–258): that leaves B 2 .B 7 + 1 and B 6 .B 7 were printed on the same half-sheet in the following arrangement: B6 r B 7 v B 2 v B 7 + 1 r B6 r and B 2 v were at the end of the original sheet, for tranchefiles run along their outer edges. If the two conjugate pairs so arranged were folded along the short axis of the half-sheet such that B6 r was brought down on B 2 v and B 7 v down on B 7 +1 r , the result would be the offset pattern seen in seventeen copies, where B 2 v and B6 r exchanged offset (reciprocal in all but May 2 and Ob), as did B 7 v and B 7 + 1 r . Of course, only the B 2 v and B6 r exchange can be offered as evidence of imposition and folding patterns, for B 7 v and B 7 +1 r would have exchanged offset after binding, from their adjacent placement in the bound book. The sensible second fold would be to bring B 6 v and B 7 r face to face and leave 2 r upward, signature visible for identification. Because B 6 v and B 7 r would often exchange offset after being bound, other evidence must demonstrate this second fold occurred. In 6. Similarly, in DLC and RPB copies, where offset exchanges occurred within the inner forme of the singletons' half-sheet, A 1 r on the outer forme has offset of Cc 4 v . In DLC, offset records two foldings of the singletons' half-sheet, with reciprocal exchanges in the first fold between A 1 v .Dd 1 r on the one hand against U 1 r .B 3 v on the other, and then U 1 v against B 3 r . The exchange between A 1 r and Cc 4 v in that copy therefore could only have occurred after the two half-sheets were cut apart and separately folded. In the RPB copy the singleton's half-sheet was certainly folded twice separately (five of the eight pages bear offset from other pages of the unit); here, the exchange between A 1 r and Cc 4 v can only be explained by supposing the two half-sheets were folded twice separately, A 1 r ending up on the outside and stacked against Cc 4 v . The NIC copy has offset linking U 1 r and Cc 4 v , but its singletons' half-sheet was folded twice separately, first along the long axis. DLC, NRU, OAU, and RPB that evidence involves exchanges by B 6 v with B 4 r and by B 7 r with B 5 v , showing fold B 4 .B 5 was temporarily encompassed by fold B 6 v .B 7 r . Other evidence for the second fold comes from B 2 r .B 7 + 1 v , left on the exterior to receive offset from outside the normal placement (in ICN 1 and KU, B 7 + 1 v exchanged offset with B 1 r ; in KU, B 2 r carries the offset of G8 v ; in RPB B 7 + 1 v received offset from K 1 r ; and in NNU 1 , B 7 + 1 v has N 1 r 's offset). No copy's offset shows that the second fold was made in the other direction, a circumstance that would have required refolding later. One might suppose that all copies would have the cancellans B half-sheet folded in the sensible fashion just described, but many do not. Apparently, about a third of the time the half-sheets lay upon the table facing the folder with what might be called the outer forme upward: B 2 r B 7 + 1 v B 6 v B 7 r Folding this half-sheet forward along the short axis, with B 2 r against B 6 v and B 7 + 1 v against B 7 r , would produce the offset pattern seen in six copies (CSt, CtY, IU, LdU-B, NIC, and ViWCF); all but one (ViWCF) have offset exchanged by both pairs of facing leaves. The exchanges are reciprocal between B 2 r and B 6 v within CSt, CtY, IU, LdU-B, and NIC, and reciprocal for the other pair in CSt, IU, LdU-B, and NIC. In NIC the second fold led to reciprocal exchanges between B 6 r and B 7 v , which left B 2 v and B 7 + 1 r on the outside (B 2 v subsequently transferred offset to B 1 r , and B 7 + 1 r transferred offset to L8 v ). In most copies with this same initial fold, the second fold turned B 2 v against B 7 + 1 r : B 2 v bears the offset of B 7 + 1 r in CtY and ViWCF, and the exchange is reciprocal in CSt, IU, and LdU-B). This double-fold left B 6 r .B 7 v on the exterior, able to exchange offset with the leaf of another printed unit, as B 6 r did with B 5 v in ViWCF, for example, and B 7 v exchanged offset with B 1 r in CtY and LdU-B. Copies with offset on B 6 r or B 7 v from outside the unit may provide evidence for the inefficient folding. The inefficiency of leaving B 6 r .B 7 v on the outside of the folded unit is curious. It might be that the workman wasn't paying attention and continued folding as if he were still facing the inner forme, or perhaps he was aware of the inappropriate orientation of the half-sheet, having noted the signature "B 2 ," but was too lazy to flip the half-sheets over or raise the center and fold. If the worker did not care that he was making a fold that would have to be unfolded, it is unlikely that he was the same fellow who would eventually bind the stacked sheets into a book, when the difficulty would have to be dealt with. The diversity of folding patterns might reflect multiple workers, or it might simply indicate a single individual rebelling against the redundancy of his task. Cancellantia in Gatherings N and R Offset evidence (as well as watermark evidence reported in "Interrelating the Cancellantia," 251, 255–257) indicates that cancellans folds N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 were not printed on one-half of a sheet, with top edges adjoining, as the B cancels were. Yet the two two-leaf folds often exchanged offset, implying that they somehow were printed on the same sheet and folded and/or stacked with one another. Pages N 1 r and R 2 v reciprocally exchanged offset in twenty copies; both leaves in the pairs N 1 r .N 2 v and R 1 v .R 2 r (with N 1 r facing R 1 v ) exchanged offset in five others, and R 1 r and N 2 v exchanged offset in two more. Thus, pages of quarter-sheets N 1 .N 2 and of R 1 .R 2 exchanged offset in twenty-seven of the twenty-eight copies seen to have offset on more than one set of nonadjacent pages. Since in many copies leaves N 1 and R 1 have tranchefiles (presumably all did before trimming), we know they were each at the end of the sheet, parallel to the short axis. Since three quarters of copies examined have a watermark on N 1 or R 1 but no copy has a watermark divided between both leaves ("Interrelating the Cancellantia," 255–256), we can surmise they were not on the same half of the sheet, with N 1 and R 1 joined at their top edges. Rather, they were probably printed on the same sheet along the long axis N 1 .N 2 .R 2 .R 1 . Prior to folding, these two conjugate folds had already been separated from whatever originally occupied the other half of the full sheet and may have been cut in half into quarter-sheets before the folding. 7 No offset from the extraneous work or works occupying the other long half of the sheet appears on N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 of any copy examined. The offset evidence argues that they were arranged on the long axis specifically as N 1 v .N 2 r .R 2 v .R 1 r (or, flipping this unit end to end, R 1 v .R 2 r .N 2 v .N 1 r ). The arrangement allowed for the quarter-sheets to be easily folded so that N 1 r and R 1 r faced upward. Also, placing leaves N 1 and R 1 on the outside edge increased the likelihood of their receiving a watermark. The arrangement is indicated by the reciprocal exchange of offset between both R 1 v /N 1 r and R 2 r /N 2 v in five copies (CSt, IU, NNU 1 , OAU, and ViWCF). This exchange may have occurred were the two pairs arranged on the uncut sheet with R 1 v .R 2 r .N 2 v .N 1 r face up and that sheet folded in half prior to cutting or, if cut, overlaid as if never cut, that is, with the inner side of fold R 1 v .R 2 r facing the outer of fold N 2 v .N 1 r . Then a second folding would reduce the unit to leaf size, engulfing one quarter-sheet within the other. Oddly in at least CSt, IU, OAU, and ViWCF copies, fold R 1 .R 2 was on the exterior of N 1 .N 2 , though this would require a lifting fold instead of a turning fold. This left R 1 r on the outside, to exchange offset reciprocally with Z8 v in CSt, IU, and OAU, and R 2 v also on the outside, to receive offset from Aa 1 r in CSt, IU, and OAU, and from Bb 1 r in ViWCF. In NNU 1 both N 1 v .N 2 r and R 2 v .R 1 r bear no offset whatsoever, as if they had dried in quarter-sheet size before any second folding occurred. However, NNU 1 's quarter-sheets were 7. It seems likely that a folder separated a sheet into halves by tearing it or slicing it, not by cutting it with shears. It is difficult to identify the method of separation, for usually the top fold in an octavo was left sealed until trimmed by the binder or cut free by the owner of an untrimmed copy. The long exterior leaf-edge as that joining A 1 with Dd 1 or U 1 with B 3 is always hidden at the spine. Scissors would seem to leave a series of straight cuts not perfectly in line and require more time than a long-bladed knife or paper slicer (I've seen little evidence of scissors used by those assembling and binding sheets). In the only untrimmed copy of this book examined (the Csj copy), the top fold and outside edge on B 3 and the half-sheet with B cancellantia were not scissored but cut free with a knife, leaving uneven edges with surpluses and deficits on adjacent leaves (Dd 1 's top complements B 3 's; B 2 's, B6's; and so on). The N and R cancellantia have had their top edges cut evenly on a straight line as by a slicer. probably folded a second time to reduce the pair of leaves to leaf size, for that seems implied by offset in CSt, IU, OAU, and ViWCF, and by the general pattern of stacking gatherings and units folded to leaf size. Curiously, we don't find any evidence that the opposite sides of these quarter-sheets were laid against each other: in no copy is offset exchanged by R 1 r /N 1 v or R 2 v /N 2 r . Such offset could have occurred if the quarter-sheets were so laid upon one another, and folded together with N 1 r facing up on top. Given the variety seen in folding the singletons' sheet and half-sheet with B cancellantia, the failure to find any instances of N 1 v .N 2 r folded against R 1 r .R 2 v (and only five copies with full exchanges between the reverse sides) suggests the four leaves were usually not cut into quarter-sheets prior to folding. The most common offset exchange between N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 , noted as reciprocal in twenty copies, is for N 1 r and R 2 v to have exchanged offset. Pages N 1 r and R 2 v were printed on different sides of the sheet, and so could not be folded face to face in the manner that N 1 r and R 1 v were in CSt, IU, NNU 1 , OAU, and ViWCF. But, if the two quarter-sheets were first cut apart, N 1 r and R 2 v could have been folded face to face in either of two ways. First, the separated quarter-sheets could have been placed open against each other, with N 1 r facing R 2 v and N 2 v facing R 1 r . Then the stacked quarter-sheets could have both been folded with N 1 v turned against N 2 r (leaving R 1 v .R 2 r on the exterior) or with R 1 v turned against R 2 r (leaving N 1 v .N 2 r on the exterior). This method is indicated if offset appears as often between one pair (R 1 r and N 2 v ) as another (N 1 r and R 2 v ), and if offset from leaves other than these four tends to occur on N 1 v .N 2 r or on R 1 v .R 2 r . Yet there is almost no evidence for this folding. None of the twenty copies with reciprocal exchange N 1 r /R 2 v also has offset exchanged between their adjacent pages, N 2 v and R 1 r . Also, no copy seen has offset from outside pages transferred to both exterior leaves of this hypothesized fold, either R 1 v .R 2 r or N 1 v .N 2 r . Further, if the quarter-sheets were cut apart, one might expect that at times the pair would have been stacked with R 1 v .R 2 r against N 1 r .N 2 v , allowing R 1 .R 2 to be folded as it ultimately would be with R 1 r outside, yet no offset shows this happened. So, there is no evidence for what might be thought a likely way to fold N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 economically (with a single cut and fold). Pages N 1 r and R 2 v could also exchange in a second way after cutting. The quarter-sheets could first be folded separately, with the first versos turned against the second rectos, and then these leaf-sized folds could be stacked with the exterior N 1 r directly under the exterior R 2 v or with exterior R 1 r directly under the exterior N 2 v . But only Owo copy's limited offset suggests N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 were first cut, folded, and stacked this way: here N 1 v was folded against N 2 r , and R 1 v against R 2 r ; then they were stacked against each other, with R 1 r facing N 2 v and exchanging offset. This arrangement left N 1 r on the exterior and able to exchange offset with B8 v . (Owo's singletons half-sheet likewise was also cut into quarter-sheets before folding.) In contrast to this rare pattern, a similar arrangement is far more common. Here the offset occurs as if the folded quarter-sheet R 1 .R 2 rather than N 1 .N 2 was on top: the offset shows N 1 r placed against R 2 v , and R 1 r and N 2 v left on the outside to receive the offset. Of the twenty copies with offset reciprocally exchanged between N 1 r and R 2 v , sixteen have an exchange between R 1 r and Z8 v and fourteen have an exchange between N 2 v and Aa 1 r , making nineteen of the twenty with at least one or the other. Furthermore, an exchange between R 1 r and Z8 v also occurred in CSt, InU, IU, and OAU, and R 2 v exchanged offset with Aa 1 r in CSt, IU, and OAU. Thus, in total, offset of either R 1 r or N 2 v appears on either Z8 v or Aa 1 r in twenty-three copies, that is, in well over half the copies where offset has been noticed (perhaps in as many as ninety percent of the copies with offset, for I initially failed to scrutinize Z8 v and Aa 1 r for offset). Why, we might ask, if the quarter-sheets had been cut free, folded, and stacked, was the R 1 .R 2 fold almost never (never except for Owo) placed underneath N 1 .N 2 such that N 2 v and R 1 r exchanged offset? That this placement occurred rarely is suggested by there being no copy seen with offset exchanged between N 1 r and Z8 v . Indeed, it is odd that, within quarter-sheets N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 , only N 2 v and R 1 r have contact with Z8 v and Aa 1 r . I believe there is a better explanation of how N 1 r and R 2 v were normally folded to exchange offset. The offset exchanges N 1 r /R 2 v , R 1 r /Z8 v , and N 2 v /Aa 1 r can be accounted for without cutting oblong N 1 .N 2 .R 2 .R 1 into quarter-sheets if the unit was instead folded three times. With the side N 1 v .N 2 r .R 2 v .R 1 r face up, the workman moved from left to right. First he folded N 1 v down on N 2 r ; then he folded N 1 r , now facing up, right and down on R 2 v , and then he either turned R 1 r downward and under or turned the three-leaf left-hand unit under R 1 , bringing R 1 v against R 2 r . If this was done, the inner formes of both folds R 1 v .R 2 r and of N 1 v .N2' would be facing each other, folded for use. Also, the leaf-sized unit would have N 2 v and R 1 r facing outward, both ready to receive offset, respectively, from adjacent leaves Aa 1 r and Z8 v . (Perhaps R 1 r , not N 2 v , was face downward toward the front of the alphabet so that the joined and rounded edges of two folds were more identifiable as appearing among separated leaf edges.) The advantage of this folding would be that the two quarter-sheet folds would be linked, and the leaves the right size for stacking. Furthermore, the two folds were ready to guide the blade and were both on the same side of the folded unit. Surely it would take more time both to fold the cancellantia down to leaf size and to separate them into two folds than it would to just fold them three times. And, if one workman folded but did not cut, he could work on, even if a companion borrowed or was using the cutting tool. In any case, even if a blade or shears were at hand and the folder was tasked with separating these quarter-sheets, folding may routinely have preceded cutting as it created the line to cut along or the fold to slice outwards. That the N and R cancellans were folded three times without cutting is suggested by their being stacked against each other with R 2 v atop N 1 r in most copies. This method explains the offset exchanged reciprocally by N 1 r and R 2 v in the aforementioned twenty copies (and possibly in CaOHM), the offset exchanged by R 1 r and Z8 v in at least sixteen of these copies, and the exchange between N 2 v and Aa 1 r in at least fourteen. All three consequent pieces of offset evidence occur in eleven copies (CaAEU, DLC, ICN 1 , LdU-B, May2, May3, MB, NIC, NRU, Ob, and RPB), and at least two occur in eight others (BrP, CtY, FU, KU, LU, May4, MR2, and NjP). Further, no contrary evidence occurs in any copy; in all of them, N 1 v faced N 2 r and R 1 v faced R 2 r , as need be the case. This hypothesis involving three folds without cutting also explains why R 1 r and N 2 v never were overlaid, exchanging offset. If this predominant offset pattern for N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 was produced without cutting, probably the other common patterns for the N and R cancellantia also did not involve cutting prior to folding. The exchange of offset between both R 1 v /N 1 r and R 2 r /N 2 v at CSt, IU, NNU 1 , OAU, and ViWCF could have occurred prior to cutting when the quarter-sheet folds were still joined. If this unit was laid out uncut as N 1 v .N 2 r .R 2 v .R 1 r , and N 1 v were folded right against N 2 r , and R 2 .R 1 backwards with R 2 r against N 2 v and then R 1 v to the right downward against N 1 r , the two sets of exchanges would occur. And this would leave R 1 r . R 2 v on the exterior to exchange offset with other leaves as happened in CSt, IU, OAU, and ViWCF. In addition, the offset exchanges in Owo and possibly CaOHM could have been produced with three folds. Imagine that the oblong four-page unit had the reverse side up, R 1 v .R 2 r .N 2 v .N 1 r . Folding again begins from the left with R 1 v turned down on R 2 r and then these two leaves turned with R 1 r face down on N 2 v , producing the reciprocal exchanges in CaOHM and Owo. Then to produce patterns in Owo the right-most leaf with N 1 r facing up was folded down and under, turning N 1 v against N 2 r and leaving N 1 r on the exterior able to transfer offset to B8 v . Or, to produce CaOHM's further exchange where N 1 r 's offset was placed on R 2 v , N 1 r was not turned under but wrongly folded left over the three-leaf stack with R 2 v upward. This final fold would leave N 1 v . N2 r on the exterior—a blunder but possibly done. If the folding began with N 1 v .N 2 r .R 2 v .R 1 r facing up, three folds could also produce CaOHM's offset pattern but still with wrong pages (R 1 v .R 2 r ) on the exterior. Neither option prepares CaOHM's R 2 v to exchange offset with Bb8 v . Gathering the Sheets Setting aside the method by which N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 were folded, we turn to two interesting facts: both folds were placed together (no copy has evidence of their being stacked apart), and they were routinely inserted into the folded stack between sheets Z and Aa (twenty-three copies have offset exchanged by either R 1 r or N 2 v with either Z8 v or Aa 1 r ). Only in a few copies do folds N 1 .N 2 and R 1 .R 2 have offset from any other leaves than each other or Z8 and Aa 1 . 8 The offset recorded for the N and R cancellantia therefore also raises the question of whether the placement in the stacked sheets reflects when the cancels were printed relative to the last gatherings. It is unlikely that they were printed before sheet Aa, for Young and Samuel Richardson's correspondence indicates that the press had Young's corrected sheets Aa and Bb before Young decided what to do with the preliminaries and the N and R cancellantia. 9 But it seems possible 8. In Owo, N 1 r transferred offset to B8 v ; in ViWCF, R 2 v exchanged offset with Bb 1 r ; and in CaOHM, R 2 v exchanged offset with Bb8 v (but in CaOHM Aa 1 r has Y8 v 's offset, indicating that sheet Z was not stacked its proper place). 9. We know from Richardson and Young's correspondence that sheet Z was printed before 21 January 1755 and that N 1 .N 2 , R 1 .R 2 , and sheet Aa were not yet printed (The Correspondence of Edward Young 1683 —1765, ed. Henry Pettit [Oxford: Clarendon , 1971], pp. 416 419). In listing corrections needed in future editions, Richardson's letter of 21 January 1755 refers to the text as far as p. 325 (Z 3 r ), making no suggestions for sheets Aa and Bb (pp. 416–417). In his undated response to Richardson , Young asks that "this last sheet [be seen] again before working off" (Pettit, p. 418). That sheet was probably Aa, but could have been Bb, to judge from remarks in a subsequent undated letter. In that letter, which Pettit dates four days later on 26 January 1755, Young remarks, "Tomorrow I expect the last Sheet" and promises, when he returns it, to speak of what to do about the dedication and the N 1 -N 2 materials that Richardson would delete and alter (pp. 418–419). Thus, Young wished to complete full text sheets before dealing with partials and cancels. Finally, that the N cancels have the highest frequency of offset exchanges suggest they were the dampest unit when folding began, and thus the last printed. that these partials were routinely inserted between the same folded sheets of a book to aid the binder in locating them and to double check that all units were included. If the folded sheets that were stacked to be bound as one copy had the first printed sheets on the bottom, then it would have been easiest to place the late-printed partials and cancels into divisions toward the end of the signature sequence (between sheets at the top of the stack). Placing them after Z would put them in a convenient position: at the end of an alphabetical sequence, and also possibly at the end of a conventional number of sheets gathered in the warehouse as a unit. ( Gaskell reports that the sheets of long books initially "were divided in quires of 12–24 sheets" [p. 144n.]). However, the position of other late-printed partials within the stack does not assist the hypotheses that the N and R cancellantia were printed after sheet Z and before Aa or that partials were routinely placed after sheet Z. The half-sheet with B cancellantia and the four original leaves for B were commonly inserted into the stack of folded sheets together. In at least fifteen copies offset was exchanged by original B leaves and the leaves of the B cancellans half-sheet. Though gathered together, the eight leaves were not yet rearranged into the order in which they were bound (for instance, B 1 v and B 4 r exchanged offset in CaOHM, CSt, and FU; B 5 v and B 7 r in DLC, N, NRU, OAU, Owo, and RPB; and B 5 v and B8 r in CSt, CtY, FU, KU, May2, May3, May4, MB, NNU 1 , and ViWCF). Also, cancellans B 3 was almost never inserted in the stack with the original or cancellans B sheets (in no copy is pre-binding offset found exchanged between B 3 and other B leaves). Unlike the N and R cancellantia, the half-sheets with the B cancels and singletons were stacked in no single position. As offset in many of these copies shows, the other eight leaves of the B gathering were inserted in various positions between sheets G and N: after G in KU (G8 v &gt;B 2 r ), after H in MB (I 1 r &lt;B 7 + 1 v ), after I in RPB (I8 v &lt;B 1 r and K 1 r &gt;B8 v ), after L in DLC (L8 v &gt;B 1 r ) and NIC (L8 v &lt;B 7 + 1 r ), and after M in NNU 1 (M8 v &gt;B 1 r ). Note that the position of the B cancels closer to the front of the stack sheets might suggest they were printed before the N and R cancellantia. Offset in some copies shows that the B cancels were gathered and stacked beside the singletons; for instance, in copy O, in addition to B6 r 's receiving Dd 1 v 's offset, B 7 + 1 r 's offset was transferred to the recto of the frontispiece—it appears as if Dd 1 was slipped in between B 2 v and B6 r , and the frontispiece was slipped in between B 7 v and B 7 + 1 r . But the leaves of the singletons and Cc 4 do not bear offset showing they were inserted while damp into the stacks of folded sheets. The frontispiece was stacked sometimes with the dedication leaves (it received offset from B 7 + 1 v in at least seven copies (BirmU, CaOTU, CLU-C, MH 2 , O, PSt, and TnU), sometimes with the singletons half-sheet (as in CtY, E, L, and MiU), and sometimes with Cc 4 (DLC and RPB). The frontispiece and whatever it was gathered with ended up inserted in diverse places (and not regularly after sheet Z). Offset indicates that the frontispiece was inserted after X8 r in MR2, after Aa8 v and before Bb1 r in LdU-B, and after Bb8 v and before Cc1 r in DLC and RPB. The singletons (B 3 stayed with them) and half-sheet Cc 4 , often with the frontispiece, were placed sometimes between sheets O and P (in NBiSU and WNs Dd1 v exchanged offset with P1 r , and in NBiSU the recto of the frontispiece has O8 v ’s offset, too). Finally, I would stress that the offset is being exchanged between pages in full sheets and half-sheets that have been folded completely into leaf-size units. Contrary to what Philip Gaskell describes as the routine process, 10 in these copies offset is never exchanged between sheets folded in half and tied for the bindery for further folding by a binder. Rather, sheets were apparently folded, thrice for whole sheets, until they were reduced to octavo size. That is evident from much offset evidence regarding the stacking, such as from the offset of cancellanda on M8 v , Q8 v , and T8 v , where offset was transferred because the sheets had been folded and collated to form books prior to the cancellations of N1, R1, and U1. Usually the partials printed together were inserted into this stack prior to their separation. However, sometimes offset indicates half-sheets of cancellantia were further cut into quarter-sheets before being inserted into the stacked sheets. Changes in the Text One last revelation about the cancellation in The Centaur Not Fabulous is offered by offset evidence: it provides text for the cancellanda replaced. One instance concerns the changes to N1.N2. Richardson on 21 January 1755 advised Young: "In another impression methinks it were to be wished that all from, If this is a man of pleasure , p. 161 [N1 r ], to, from a higher hand , p. 163, were omitted, as it interrupts, by ludicrous images, emotions that were nobly excited." 11 While Young kept the initial clause, the phrase ending the proposed deletion does not appear on or near p. 163. Richardson applauded as affective what preceded the clause "If this is a man of pleasure," offering no encouragement to alter the preceding two paragraphs on N1 r . Yet p. 161 has relatively less text than is usual, with nineteen lines and three paragraph spacings (twenty lines and three such spacings is typical in the book), and the first spacing atop the page is redundant (there is one at the bottom of the previous page, M8 v ). One might therefore wonder whether something was removed on N1 r . However, the offset of the cancellandum 10 Gaskell notes that a "gatherer ... walked along the line of sheets, taking off one copy of each in turn, until he had gathered a complete copy of the book in sheets. The book was knocked smooth at the edges and laid down, together with any inserts such as plates and cancellantia, and the process was repeated ... until all the sheets were taken from one of the heaps. The books were then collated to ensure that each was made up correctly, and they were finally folded in half (2°, 4°, and 8° across the longer side, 12° across the shorter side), pressed, and baled up for delivery or storage" (pp. 143–144). As noted above, Gaskell says that in long books this folding in half occurred "in quires of 12–24 sheets" (p. 144n.). 11 Correspondence , pp. 416–417. Richardson called for another cut affecting pp. 163–164 (N2 r -N2 v ), and neither the quoted words beginning that section nor ending it remain. received by M8 v in the CtY, DLC, IU, NIC, and ViWCF copies indicates the text on N1 r was not substantially changed but that a line from cancellandum N1 r was moved to the next page to fill in for material cut within N1 v -N2 v . These copies show that the cancellandum’s final line has the same reading as the first line of cancellans N1 v : "total, is the transit of these Phaeton -" and the catchword ("tiades;") was the rest of that word, found now on the second line ("tiades:" with different punctuation). Also, the cancellandum’s third and second last lines (on N1 r ) read the same as the cancellans’ penultimate and final lines. In CtY, we can see on M8 v that the final three lines of the preceding paragraph also remained unchanged ("gay ... expired."), and scattered lines on the page above are in the same position relative to one another as they are in the cancellans, suggesting that no changes other than to accidentals or substantives of few letters probably occurred. One can make out a few words in the top paragraph, as the same first line (on page and in paragraph). The CtY, DLC, and ViWCF copies’ offsets show that the cancellans has one fewer line because the spacing before and after the first paragraph was increased, not as a result of anything added to the cancellans’ text: in the cancellandum there was 4 mm of space between "161" and the final word in the first line, "poison’d" (ViWCF), whereas in the cancellans this distance is 10–11 mm. In ViWCF, offset indicates cancellandum N1 r began as it currently does: "My principles have poison’d | my friend." The first four lines to "wife!—" are identical in cancellandum and cancellans, and the words "is there another" occur in the fifth line of both. In addition, the cancellandum N2 v ’s text, to judge from offset in DLC on N3 r , held the identical text on its last five lines. However, offset from the cancellandum on N3 r of OAU indicates the page began with different text ("I mean, of our ... [word in italics not clear] because real men"). Offset of the cancellandum of R1 r appears on Q8 v in over a dozen copies. Clear offset in CtY, DLC, FU, ICN1, IU, and LdU-B indicate that the cancellandum of Ri r carried seven lines, three fewer than does the cancellans, and that these lines are identical in the two versions, in accidentals as well as substantives. The cancellandum’s catchword was "world’s" (which begins line 8 of the cancellans). Young and Richardson’s correspondence does not indicate why leaves R1 and R2 were cancelled, but at least the offset from the cancellandum of R1 r indicates that the two leaves were cancelled to add, not to cut, text. However, the addition was not that substantial since the cancellandum of R2 v had one more line than the cancellans: the first word of the cancellandum of R2 v was "turn" (indicated by offset in OAU on R3 r ), as is the first word on line 2 of the cancellans. As for leaf U1, offset on T8 v in DLC and FU shows that lines 1–3 of U1 r are the same in both cancellans and cancellandum, but in line 4 the cancellans spreads out the words "lessen its formidable gloom" and then begins a new sentence with "I | have seen a Death-bed." Lines 4–6 of the cancellandum read: "lessen its formidable gloom. To Cen- | taurs , especially ... [least?] the among | them, who may be |" (beneath "who may be" in the line below is a word beginning "impe" [perhaps "impeach’d"] and directly below that in the next line is "to each"—none of these words following "gloom" appear in the cancellans paragraph). Offset (especially in DLC) indicates that the second paragraph of the cancellandum began with a sentence now cut: "But to return to our last bed, the | grave" (fifth and fourth last lines). Thereafter the fourth last through final lines have the same text as the cancellans. The verso of cancellans U1 appears not to carry significant revision. The cancellandum’s offset on U2 r in DLC suggests that the last nine lines on U1 v have not been changed and shows that the last two lines of U1 v were identical except that "death;" in the last line ended with a comma. Conclusions and Speculations The discovery that sheets of The Centaur were folded and collated while the printing went forward leads to the cautious supposition that at least a few copies of books with cancels are likely to contain offset from the cancellanda (and that such instances should be sought in books known to contain cancels). Conversely, the presence of offset might indicate that cancellation has occurred. It stands to reason that the wetter the sheet (the more recently printed it was) the more prone it was to receive and transfer its image to the adjacent page. It would seem likely that offset is, as in this edition, more common in cancellantia and partials involving preliminary and final leaves than the regular sheets of the book, for these were usually printed late in the run and folded closer to the time of printing, rushed by the desire to publish, and thus folding occurred while sheets tended to be damper and more vulnerable to offsetting. Also, the cancellantia and partials were damper when placed into the sorted stacks of sheets for particular copies. Much offset can be identified as transferred while in a pre-bound stack of the folded sheets and not just during the folding of the sheets. For instance, in the May1 copy, T8 v ’s and U2 r ’s offsets are cast in the top margin on U1 r and U1 v respectively, and cancellans U1’s are cast in the bottom margins on T8 v and U2 r ; the alignments are 10 mm above and below present position. Similarly, in O-HF R2 v ’s offset on R3 r is too low to have been caused after the sheets were bound—the offset from R2 v ’s footnote is 3 mm lower than it is currently positioned in this contemporary-bound copy. Offset transference during the stacking period is sometimes apparent from offset’s being laid down obliquely. In O, B6 v ’s offset runs obliquely across B7 r as not folded properly when stacked (the leaves are bound with lines parallel in the contemporary-bound copy, and the offset of B7 v on B8 r is straight and parallel to the bound book). Also, offset exchanged between sheets not adjacent, as between Y8 v and Aa1 r in CaOHM, must reflect exchanges during the stacking. It seems likely that offset exchange is caused more by moist paper than by wet ink (ink was expected to set, not dry), either because the wetness of the transferring paper had somewhat dissolved the ink or, more likely, because the moist receiving paper was more absorbent (that paper was more absorbent when wet is the reason for wetting the sheets prior to printing). Nonetheless, the role of ink should not be entirely discounted. The amount of offset in sheets of The Centaur varies between copies as if partly the product of the amount of ink applied to the type-forme. The degree of inking on the same forme varied not only between the impression of one sheet and the next but across the forme during a single impression—thus, on a page one might see much bleed-through at the top of a leaf and none at the bottom. Sometimes a page-setting was inked enough that the printed page threw offset on other pages when it was folded, when it was stacked, and after it was bound; thus, in CaOHM we find R2 v cast offset on N1 r , also exchanged reciprocally with Bb8 v , and R3 r (similarly, CSt's R2 v discharged offset to both N2 v and Aa1 r ). Also, the sizing must affect the extent and depth to which a sheet absorbed ink. 12 The thickness of a paper stock must affect the degree that moisture is retained (parenthetically, the thicker the paper, the less interference of bleed-through from the opposite side of the sheet). In The Centaur , all partials and cancellantia have the same paper stock as that found in most sheets of the book, one with an "NH" watermark. 13 Conclusions about the impact of paper are difficult in part because even within the dominant paper stock the thickness of leaves varies considerably: sometimes one can look through the eighth leaf of a gathering to read the next signature and sometimes one cannot. Another consideration relative to moistness of the paper involves whether the two sides of a sheet were equally dry—if sheets were hung folded over a line as in many depictions, then one side might remain damper and more prone to the exchange of offset, something I have not investigated. This study can offer a tentative answer to the question whether a damp leaf was more prone to discharge (express) or to receive (absorb) offset. Certainly in exchanges between cancellantia pages N1 r , N2 v , R2 v , U1 r , and U1 v with M8 v and other pages of full sheets that these faced, the cancellantia much more often discharged than received offset (as shown in the table below). The only unreciprocated exchanges between M8 v and cancellans N1 r involve M8 v ’s receiving N1 r ’s offset (from CaAEU and twelve other copies); the only unreciprocated offset between cancellans R2 v and R3 r involve R3 r ’s receiving R2 v ’s offset (from CaOHM and six other copies). Also, N2 v received offset from Aa1 r only in eight copies with reciprocal exchanges (CaAEU, ICN1, LdU-B, May3, May4, MB, NRU, and Ob), but it transferred its offset to Aa1 r in six others (BrP, DLC, KU, May2, NIC, and RPB); in no copies did I note offset moving only from Aa1 r to N2 v (and, since N2 v was a cancel, I would have consistently scrutinized it for offset). Similarly, I noted Aa1 r ’s receiving offset from R2 v (CSt, IU, and OAU) but never did I find R2 v ’s receiving offset from Aa1 r . (The disproportion in these exchanges suggests that the N and R cancellantia were printed well after sheet Aa.) Leaves B1.B8 and B4.B5 from the original printing of the B sheet were often stacked facing the B cancellantia; offset from such reveals the later printed cancellantia more 12 Leonard N. Rosenband , in discussing how paper was coated with sizing, notes that it is an important factor in the paper’s absorption (Papermaking in Eighteenth-Century France: Management, Labor, and Revolution at the Montgolfier Mill, 1761–1805 [ Baltimore : Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2000], pp. 12–13). 13 All sheets have the same paper with "NH" watermark except for four sheets that have one of three paper stocks with fleur-de-lys watermarks centered on the chain-lines. All these three have chain-lines 25–25.5 mm apart but differ in the shape and the dimensions of the fleur-de-lys’s head, arms, and tail: 17–19, 39–42, 23–25 mm in sheet B; another with flattened head 15.5–17, 32–36, 23–26 mm in E and N; and a third with lanceolate fleur-head, 17, 40–44, 20–22 mm in Q and in many frontispiece leaves. often discharged offset to the early printed leaves than received it. For instance, although B1 r has reciprocal exchanges with B7 v (LdU-B) and B7 + 1 v (KU), the only non-reciprocal exchanges involve its receiving offset from B2 v (NIC), B7 v (CtY, IU, ViWCF), and B7 + 1 v (ICN1). B5 v unreciprocally transferred offset to B8 r in eight copies, yet it never did so to a page of cancellantia; it reciprocally exchanged with B6 r or B7 r in five copies and received offset from these pages in five others. Exchanges between the frontispiece and other leaves also suggest damp leaves were more prone to transfer offset than to receive it. It seems likely that the frontispiece was produced outside of Richardson ’s shop and, even more likely given the delays caused by Young’s revisions, well before publication (Young had asked Richardson about 11 August 1754 to have it cut [Correspondence , p. 411]). Other than a reciprocal exchange in MH2, no text leaf has been seen to have absorbed the image of the frontispiece, yet the frontispiece received much offset, not only from the title-page A1 r (L, NBiSU, NjP) but from B3 v in CtY, X8 v in MR2, Aa8 v in LdU-B, and Bb8 v in DLC and RPB. Not surprisingly, the blank recto of the frontispiece received much offset: from B7 + 1 v in CaOTU, CLU-C, MH2, O, PSt, and TnU; O8 v in NBiSU; Bb1 r in LdU-B; Cci r in DLC and RPB; and Dd1 v in L, E, and MiU. It is noteworthy that with one exception (NBiSU) only leaves from the final gatherings printed transferred offset to the frontispiece. In NBiSU the frontispiece verso received offset from A1 r , and P1 r received offset from Dd1 v ; thus, partials and cancels stacked close to O8 and the frontispiece probably provided moistness for the irregular exchange. But the vagaries about inking and paper cannot alone explain which copies have offset. It must be significant that, if there is offset in one of the three printed units with partial gatherings and cancellantia (singletons-Cc sheet, the B cancellantia half-sheet, and the N1.N2 and R1.R2 folds), there is offset usually in the other units: that is true of twenty-four of twenty-eight copies with more than one offset exchange between a page of the partials and cancellantia and pages not adjacent to them, and the remaining four have offset exchanges within two of the units. (The exceptions to this pattern are the five copies noted in footnote 4 that have a single exchange, four of which involve the sheet including the title-page, Dd1, and the cancellantia B3 and U1 — very possibly the final sheet printed.) The frequency of offset (implying dampness at folding) on the three different sheets suggests they were printed concurrently, something possible at a shop with as many presses as Richardson ’s and supported by the press figures: the sheet with Cc 4 and the partials has press figures 1 on Cc3 r and 4 on Cc3 v ; the half-sheet with B cancellantia has figure 7 on B7 + 1 r ; and cancellans R2 r has figure 2. Also, the propensity either for all the partials in a copy to discharge and receive offset or for none of them to do so confirms what the paper evidence offered in my "Interrelating the Cancellantia" indicated: that all the replacement leaves in a specific copy were from the same original sheets (damp sheets, as distinguished from ones allowed to dry longer). The proportion of copies with that propensity suggests that half the copies were bound up soon after printing. It is easy to imagine the order was to "bind half," but perhaps the interruption for a weekend might have created sufficient time for sheets to dry thoroughly prior to folding. Since the second edition was felt likely enough to begin a revised setting prior to the publication of the first edition, no great time duration is likely to exist between those copies first bound up and those bound later. 14 APPENDIX 1 Copies Examined Asterisks indicate offset exchanges with non-adjacent pages (other than the frontispiece) by at least one page of the partials and cancels.

Six of the ten essays in that volume reappeared, attributed to Barbauld , in the 1825 edition of Barbauld's Works compiled by her niece, Lucy Aikin , after Barbauld's death. Aside from those six, Lucy Aikin reprinted seven essays from other sources. 1 The thirteen essays thus reprinted by Lucy Aikin appeared to constitute Barbauld's total output of short prose pieces. In fact Barbauld published more prose than Lucy Aikin reprinted, or, probably, knew of. Works is obviously incomplete: it does not include Barbauld's signed literary criticism (the prefaces to Akenside , Collins , Richardson's Correspondence, The Spectator, and The British Novelists ) or her books for children. It also silently omits several unsigned pieces acknowledged by her, chiefly the two Civic Sermons from 1792. Furthermore, references in letters by Barbauld and John Aikin imply a larger body of post- Miscellaneous Pieces essay-writing than the seven pieces Lucy Aikin reprinted. Finally, John Kenrick , a stepson of Barbauld's close friend Elizabeth Belsham Kenrick who had access to Barbauld letters and manuscript poems now lost, attributed to Barbauld essays and reviews not mentioned by Lucy Aikin . A difference between Lucy's and Kenrick's attitudes towards Barbauld attribution can be gathered from their ways of noticing Barbauld's reviews (unsigned) for The Annual Review, edited by her nephew Arthur Aikin and published by 1. Lucy Aikin , ed., The Works of Anna Letitia Barbauld . With a Memoir, 2 vols. ( London , 1825). From Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose: "The Hill of Science," "On Romances: An Imitation," "Seláma: An Imitation of Ossian," "Against Inconsistency in our Expectations," "On Monastic Institutions," and "An Inquiry into those Kinds of Distress which excite agreeable Sensations: With a Tale" ( Works, 2:163–231). From the Monthly Magazine: "Dialogue between Madam Cosmogunia and a Philosophical Inquirer of the Eighteenth Century" (1 [1796]: 19–22, unsigned; in Works, 2:277–287); "Letter of John Bull " (1 [1796]: 184–186; in Works, 2:288–294); "Letter on Watering-places" (2 [1796]: 605–608, signed " Henry Homelove"; in Works, 2:295–304); "On Education" (5 [1798]: 167–171, unsigned; titled "What Is Education?" in Works, 2:305–320), and "On Prejudice" (9 [1800]: 139–144, unsigned; in Works, 2:321–337). From another source: "The Curé of the Banks of the Rhone " (2:260–267; first published in The Morning Chronicle, 29 Nov. 1793, unsigned and titled "To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle"). Aikin reprinted "Fashion, a Vision" (Monthly Magazine, 3 [April 1797]: 254–256, unsigned) in A Legacy for Young Ladies ( London , 1826), pp. 165–179. In each collection Aikin also printed pieces not previously published. While those are not part of my subject here, I will notice several pieces first published after Aikin's editions came out (A29–33). Aikin also reprinted poems from periodicals, including six from the Monthly Magazine; for them, see The Poems of Anna Letitia Barbauld , ed. William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft (Athens, GA, 1994; cited hereafter as PALB ). Longmans. Lucy Aikin acknowledged them grudgingly, as if Barbauld had dirtied her hands: she "reluctantly took part of the poetry and polite literature in one or two of the earliest volumes." Kenrick , citing a letter from Arthur Aikin to a friend, simply declared that Barbauld wrote "the leading articles in poetry and belles letters." 2 Kenrick appears to have spoken from knowledge, and Lucy Aikin to have been ignorant, or disingenuous. In any case Aikin's editing was hasty: Barbauld died on 9 March 1825, and Works was published on 8 July. 3 In Anna Letitia Barbauld , Voice of the Enlightenment, I reported that Barbauld published a number of prose pieces anonymously or pseudonymously in magazines and that the disappearance or destruction of her papers and the archives of her publishers made identifying them problematic, but that I had compiled a list of candidates I was not then ready to declare. 4 In attribution work, however, "ready" is often a purely relative term. Absent new information that may still turn up, and in the belief that Barbauld's writings will in time be genuinely collected, I propose to tell here what is known and what I surmise about her uncollected periodical prose, and to publish my list of additions to and candidates for her canon. Two of the additions have been reprinted already by Elizabeth Kraft and me in our Barbauld anthology from Broadview Press, and several candidates are discussed in Voice of the Enlightenment . 5 Here I offer a synoptic account of both kinds, which may stand in the place of arguments for attributions in a future Collected Works. In letters, Barbauld and her brother referred several times to her interest in writing essays or her actual writing of them. Congratulating her on settling near London , John Aikin saw "a glorious opportunity" to collaborate on "a periodical paper." Aikin recurred to a topic he had probably urged before, knowing Barbauld's fondness for The Spectator (to which she had alluded in a recent letter to him). It's as if he is inviting her to pick up the collaboration they had left off with Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose. Ten years earlier, Barbauld for her part had humorously proposed to him that they put their "fragments" together in a 'Joineriana." 6 2. Lucy Aikin , Memoirs, Miscellanies and Letters, ed. Philip Hemery Le Breton ( London , 1864), pp. 163–164; Kenrick , Biographical Memoir of the late Rev. Charles Wellbeloved ( London , 1860), p. 60. Longman's Joint Commission and Divide Ledger for 1803 shows that for articles contributed to Volume 1 of The Annual Review Barbauld was paid £30—twice as much as any other reviewer except Arthur Aikin himself: for details see William McCarthy , Anna Letitia Barbauld , Voice of the Enlightenment ( Baltimore , MD, 2008), pp. 411 and 648n7. Barbauld's reviews will not be a subject of the present essay; they require an essay of their own. 3. "Published this Day" ( Morning Chronicle, 8 July 1825).

In 2011 Barbauld's letters to her pupil Lydia Rickards from 1798 to 1815 came to light and were sold at auction to a private buyer who has not come forward. Since one piece published in Aikin's Legacy collection originated as letters to Lydia , the letters may give new information about Barbauld's other writings. 6. Aikin to Barbauld , 27 February 1787, quoted in ALBVE, p. 370; Works 2:9 (ca. 1776); see also ALBVE, p. 260. Letters cited by date in the text hereafter are identified in ALBVE, pp. 677–687. I speak to the issue of collaboration in n. 30 below. Early in 1791 Aikin returned to the idea of a periodical—this time, a magazine. Neither Barbauld nor her husband felt equal to conducting a magazine, so she declined (28 February 1791). But in mid-1792 she undertook to write, at the risk of prosecution, a political periodical called Civic Sermons to the People. Two numbers appeared anonymously, and Aikin announced that "the author" intended to continue the series. Civic Sermons did not continue; perhaps Joseph Johnson, its publisher, feared prosecution, or Barbauld found that she could not keep up the pace. 7 At the turn of 1793, now nervous herself about political reprisals, she cautioned her nephew Charles not to give copies of a "Dialogue," a "Fragment," and a "Historical Fragment" she sent him in manuscript (4 January [1793]). The "Dialogue" is likely to have been the one "between Madam Cosmogunia and a Philosophical Inquirer" published unsigned in the Monthly Magazine with a date of 1 January 1793 and reprinted by Lucy Aikin . The other two pieces are not known today. Early and late in 1793 there appeared in the Morning Chronicle, a liberal newspaper conducted by James Perry , two Barbauld pieces: a poem, "To Dr. Priestley , Dec. 29, 1792," and a letter purporting to transmit the speech of a French curé to the Revolutionary Convention. Neither was signed. Barbauld complained that the poem was published behind her back, but she acknowledged it in the same letter to her nephew that mentions the dialogue and fragments; by 1795 her authorship was known, and the poem is reprinted in Works. Whether she or another published the "curé"'s letter is not known, but the letter was reprinted almost immediately with a preface by "Bob Short," for the benefit of Spitalfield silk-weavers whose trade had been choked by the war; by 1806 the letter was known to be Barbauld's , and it too is reprinted in Works. 8 Thus there is some ground for suspecting that other pieces in the Morning Chronicle may be hers also, although their identity (with one possible exception, Bi below) would be highly conjectural. When John Aikin took on the literary editorship of Richard Phillips's Monthly Magazine early in 1796, his dream of collaborating again with his sister must have revived. It was known outside the family that she had promised to write for the Monthly , 9 and on two occasions Aikin told correspondents that Barbauld did write for it: "she has enriched the miscellany with several contributions which I believe have been of much advantage to its reputation," and (less assertively) she "now &amp; then gives me a trifle (I mean as to bulk) for the Magazine." 10 I have said that Lucy Aikin reprinted six essays and six poems from the Monthly. All are unsigned in their Monthly printings, except for one poem signed "A.L.B." and two essays, the one signed in its title "Letter of John Bull ," and the one signed " Henry Homelove." 11 Lucy did not reprint an unsigned memoir of Thomas Mulso or 7. On Civic Sermons see ALBVE, pp. 320–323 and 628nn33–41. They are not listed here because they were pamphlets, not periodical essays. 8. See ALBVE, pp. 342 and 633nn98–99 ("Curé"), and 343 and 633n101 ("Priestley"). 9. A Aikin friend named her as one of the expected writers ( ALBVE, p. 370). 10. Aikin to John Pinkerton , 10 March 1799, and to Joseph Cooper Walker , 15 April 1799 (Hackney Archives, MSS 3711 and 3712). 11. See n. 1 above. Although unsigned, ALB's Cosmogunia dialogue was recognized as hers by Theophilus Lindsey (letter to William Tayleur , 7 March 1796; information from Grayson Ditchfield , editor of Lindsey's letters). Her 1798 essay on education was also known at once to be hers ( Morning Post, 11 April 1798, in a paragraph on the latest issue of the Monthly Magazine ). a memoir of Hester Mulso Chapone signed "A.L.B.", both of which Barbauld acknowledged (A 10 and A 13 , below). On 4 November [1801?], Barbauld wrote to Phillips refusing his request to reprint Monthly Magazine essays by her, for "I may very probably some time publish a Volume of Prose pieces, &amp; therefore cannot conveniently lessen my stock." 12 No such volume ever appeared; but if she intended it to comprise her Monthly essays, she must have had more than six to reprint. In their Works and Legacy texts, the six Monthly essays total only 75 loosely-printed pages. The idea of a periodical paper surfaced again in 1804, this time from Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth : they urged Barbauld to superintend a periodical whose contributors would be exclusively women. As she had in 1791, Barbauld begged off superintending (30 August 1804). She also deprecated the idea of a "ladies-only" magazine. But she expressed willingness to contribute papers so long as she wasn't tied to a schedule, and she went on to reflect on essay-writing and her own tastes in it: A paper is a pleasing mode of writing, as it admits equally the lightest and the gravest subjects; the most desultory, and the most profound, if treated concisely; but humour and character, the manners and modes of the times seem to be the subject more particularly called for.... I should think signatures, that might be afterwards acknowledged like those in the Spectator, would in general be more agreeable to the feelings of the writers than the giving the name at first.... Once it was a favorite scheme of mine, had my brother been willing to join, and I had then several little pieces which might have answered such a purpose, but they have been scattered about in Magazines, and I dare not trust to the future, expecting naturally to grow duller and duller, and besides always writing slow, so that I should not dare to bring upon myself an obligation ... of supplying the press at stated times, whether I have anything to say or not—but I would rank with pleasure among the occasional contributors. In 1807 Joseph Johnson was under the impression that Barbauld had joined with Edgeworth and Elizabeth Hamilton in a periodical-essay project; though mistaken in this, his belief might have stemmed from knowledge of her taste for essay-writing or her practice of it elsewhere. 13 In 1804 Barbauld agreed to select and introduce a three-volume anthology of essays from The Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, a project that renewed her appreciation of Addison and Steele and her interest in the history of manners and styles. Then, in January and February 1807, in the first two numbers of John Aikin's new periodical the Athenaeum, appeared a two-part essay, "Comparison of Manners," signed "Balance." Writing to another contributor, Aikin coyly said that "the correspondent on whose paper on the comparison of manners you bestow such flattering applause is very certain to continue his exertions for the 12. MS P:19.2, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, University of Kansas . 13. Johnson to Hamilton , 16 Jan. 1807 ( Johnson Letterbook, Pforzheimer Collection, New York Public Library). Barbauld's mention to Edgeworth of "Magazines" in which her "little pieces" were "scattered" might seem to mean more than one periodical, but she could have meant monthly numbers of the Monthly Magazine. Johnson and Phillips , the Monthly's publisher, were neighbors in St. Paul's Churchyard. Athenaeum as long as it is under my direction." In 1874 Kenrick reported that Barbauld "furnished two papers suggested by her recent study of the British Essayists to the Athenaeum ." 14 All indications converge here: these two essays (A 17 below) are Barbauld's , even though neither they nor any other pieces from the Athenaeum were reprinted by Lucy Aikin . In 1807 also, Barbauld began sending occasional pieces to the Monthly Repository, a Unitarian-leaning journal edited by Robert Aspland . Five of her poems first appeared there, only two of them signed (one by "A.L.B." and one prefaced by a short note signed "A. L. Barbauld" ); all were reprinted by Lucy Aikin . 15 Also appearing there, unsigned but later attributed by Lucy , was Barbauld's memoir of her husband (A 21 below). And finally, in 1810 Barbauld acknowledged to Maria Edgeworth that she had written a letter to the Gentleman's Magazine defending Edgeworth against a hostile review in the Quarterly; this piece was signed "Y.Z." 16 It too is not in Works. More than a year after the appearance of Lucy Aikin's Barbauld editions, four "discourses" were published as Barbauld's by her other nephew and adopted son, Charles Rochemont Aikin , in the Monthly Repository. Aikin introduced them with a preface: Amongst many papers (mostly fragments) left by my late venerable aunt, Mrs. Barbauld , are a few discourses written at various periods of her life, and I believe not intended by her for publication, which it was not thought expedient to add to the collection of her finished works lately published. 17 Perhaps feeling authorized by this publication, Anna Maria Hall , editing The Juvenile Forget-Me-Not ... for the Year 1830, printed "The Misses (addressed to a careless girl.) By the late Mrs Barbauld ." Perhaps, too, in response to a sharp rebuke by Lucy Aikin to publication elsewhere of two occasional poems by Barbauld , Hall took pains to declare "The Misses" authentic. 18 From this survey, what principles can be derived to guide us in Barbauld attribution? The most customary evidence for attribution is the most obvious: the piece was originally published over Barbauld's name or was collected by Lucy Aikin , or both. (But even such evidence is not infallible: Aikin reprinted as Barbauld's a hymn by Robert Barnard . 19 ) Some pieces, however, though neither published over Barbauld's name nor collected by Aikin , were eventually claimed by Bar- 14. Aikin to William Shepherd , 15 March 1807 (MS 2385, The Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations); Kenrick , Review of Le Breton , Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld ( Inquirer, 27 June 1874). 14. A poem signed "Anna" not reprinted by Aikin was attributed to Barbauld by Francis E. Mineka in his study of the Monthly Repository (The Dissidence of Dissent, Chapel Hill, NC, 1944). Kraft and I accepted the attribution in PALB (Poem 140), but the signature "Anna" appears also in the British Lady's Magazine in 1815 and 1816 and may not be Barbauld's . 16. See SPP, p. 457. The letter is A 24 below. 17. Monthly Repository, n.s. 1 (July 1827): 477. The discourses are items A 29 –32 below. 18. See A 33 for details. Aikin's rebuke is "Mrs. Barbauld's MSS," Monthly Repository, n.s. 2 (1828): 55. 19. See PALB, p. 211. bauld (examples are her memoirs of Thomas Mulso and Hester Mulso Chapone , A 10 and A 13 below), or were attributed to her in her lifetime and tacitly acknowledged, like Lessons for Children. 20 One signature Barbauld is known to have used is "A.L.B.": it subjoined the first appearances of two poems included in Works, the Chapone memoir, and the preface to Hymns in Prose for Children. In the journals to which she is known to have contributed, I have seen no instance of those initials appearing below a piece whose attribution to her is contradicted by other information. Pieces signed "A.L.B." in journals that printed other work identified as hers (either at the time or later, by herself or by Lucy Aikin ) may therefore be attributed confidently to her. 21 Attribution by another witness who is well situated to know may also constitute adequate evidence for Barbauld's authorship. Besides Barbauld's Aikin relatives and John Kenrick , such a witness was G. E. Griffiths , editor of the Monthly Review, who annotated every review with an abbreviation signifying its author's name; between July 1809 and October 1815 he annotated 345 reviews with the abbreviation "Mrs. Bar.," "Mrs. Bd.," or, following these, "D[itt]o." 22 In the case at least of Barbauld , "well situated to know" is an important qualification. Contemporaries attributed the whole of John Aikin's Evenings at Home to her, although, according to Lucy Aikin in 1825, Barbauld wrote only fourteen of the 99 pieces in it; and John's essay "On the Pleasure derived from Objects of Terror, with Sir Bertrand , a Fragment" was routinely attributed to Barbauld . 23 20. Lessons was tacitly acknowledged on the title-page to Hymns in Prose for Children: "by the author of Lessons for Children." 21. A seeming exception is the signature "ALB" to verses in French in The Kaleidoscope for 19 June (p. 416), 3 July (p. 432) and 31 July (p. 29) 1827, and 20 May 1828 (p. 389). One is dated after Barbauld's death, and two are dated from streets on which she is not known to have lived. Further, had they been meant to be taken as hers they would have been signed "Mrs. Barbauld ," as other posthumous pieces were in the serials that printed them. The verses were brought to my attention by Professor Scott Krawczyk . 22. ALBVE, pp. 432–433, and, for full details, Benjamin C. Nangle , The Monthly Review: Indexes of Contributors and Articles (Oxford, 1955). 23. On Evenings at Home see ALBVE, pp. 324 and 629n47; Barbauld's pieces in it, because not journalism, do not fall within the scope of the present essay. So confidently was "Sir Bertrand " ascribed to Barbauld that a London newspaper printed an anecdote about her writing it ( Diary, 17 March 1790). The misattribution enjoyed a long life: it reappears in a 1973 collection, Great British Tales of Terror, edited by Peter Haining (Penguin). Barbauld's high reputation in the early United States induced a Baltimore bookseller to insinuate her authorship of Sermons on the Doctrines and Duties of Christianity. By a Lady (1816): "It is understood that these Sermons were written by that pious and distinguished woman" ("Advertisement"). The author identified herself, however, as firmly Church-of- England ("Preface," p. viii), and is now believed to be Harriet Bowdler . On the other hand, when the author of a piece declares that Barbauld translated it he should probably be credited. French Protestant and Girondin leader Jean-Paul Rabaut St. Etienne (1743–93) was reported by visiting sympathizer Charles James to have told James on 21 November 1792 that "his 'Letters to the English' were translated by Mrs. Barbauld " ( James's Journal, quoted in Cyrus Redding, Fifty Years' Recollections, Literary and Personal [1858], 2:89, online edition by David Hill Radcliffe ). This must have been Rabaut's Adresse aux Anglois (1791), published in English by Joseph Johnson as Address to the English Nation. Translated from the French of J. P. Rabaut de St. Etienne (1791). Barbauld's relations with Rabaut , probably mediated through his pupil John Scipio Sabonadière , are explored in ALBVE, pp. 246–247, 285–287, and 320–321; see especially p. 286, where she mentions Rabaut's Address on the eve of its London publication; at the very least, she knew it was coming. At the time of writing I had not seen Redding's Recollections; this passage lends support to the speculation that Barbauld and Rabaut had met. In this instance they may even have collaborated. Pieces not signed with Barbauld’s name or initials, not collected by Lucy Aikin, not known to have been claimed by Barbauld , and not attributed to her by someone else, fall into the category bewailed by Harold Love in Attributing Authorship: An Introduction: "Of all the tasks facing attribution studies, that of uncredited journalism and pamphleteering from the eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century is the most daunting." 24 The attribution problems these pieces present resemble those of the Defoe canon. In what follows, then, my effort to derive attribution principles from what we know about Barbauld will be guided by the "Principles of Author-attribution" set forth by P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens in their Critical Bibliography of Daniel Defoe. The main issue concerns "internal" evidence of authorship. "The question," Furbank and Owens write, what can properly be regarded as internal evidence, is complex. One important class of such evidence will be close resemblance to the author’s known works, especially close verbal resemblance or unacknowledged quotation, but also close similarity in regard to some idiosyncratic train of thought. Internal evidence, to be convincing, is likely to consist of more than one piece, and a stylistic resemblance can be strengthened as evidence by known facts about the author. ... 25 By "verbal resemblance," Furbank and Owens emphatically do not mean "favourite phrases"; appeal to an author’s supposed favorite phrases they regard as "a dangerous delusion." Having myself attributed to Barbauld , partly on the basis of "favourite phrases," a poem by William Smyth , I am ruefully alive to the wisdom of that view. 26 However, On the other hand we regard it as legitimate in attribution to pay regard to favourite allusions (anecdotes, historical references, legendary stories and the like) and also to favourite quotations. ... How much weight [to give them] is a difficult question and will depend very much on the context and on how many of them there are in a given work; at best they are a relatively weak prop to an ascription, but sometimes they are all, or almost all, that one has to go on. (p. xxvii) Even so, Furbank and Owens set themselves "a strict rule not to treat a work as certainly by Defoe on the basis of internal evidence alone" (p. xxvi). They also adopted the principle that evidence for attribution should never be based "on some other merely probable attribution"; rather, every new ascription "should draw solely upon works indisputably by the author in question" (p. xxv). Although Defovians have objected to the Furbank -Owens "de- 24 Cambridge , UK, 2002, p. 30. 25 London , 1998, p. xxvi. 26 Poem 123 in PALB. See also (I regret to say) ALBVE, pp. 464–465. The poem, which in Poems is only a fragment, is titled "Elegy" in its full text and was published in Smyth’s English Lyricks, Part II (1805), a book reviewed in the Annual Review, 4 (1806): 613 –615. English Lyricks was dedicated to William Wallace Currie , son of a friend of John Aikin , and conceivably Barbauld reviewed it; that could explain the appearance of a partial text of the poem among Aikin family papers. Though she did not write it, it probably spoke to her. monish us to attribute with caution. Adopting these principles, I now attempt to profile Barbauld ’s practices in essay-writing. 27 She avowed a taste for writing essays of "humour and character" on "the manners and modes of the times." Essays of that sort known to be hers are "Letter on Watering-Places" signed "Henry Homelove" (both humorous and about current fashion), "Comparison of Manners" signed "Balance" (more historical in emphasis), and "Letter of John Bull " (on the rage for loyalty oaths, mocking political fashion). The signatures to these essays suggest that Barbauld adopted the practice from older periodical essays of signing character pieces with thematic or "speaking" names. (She also signed her Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts and Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation in that way: the first was signed "A Dissenter" and the second "A Volunteer"—in both instances, presumably to disguise her sex.) In journals to which she is known to have contributed, pieces so signed are potential candidates for her canon. They are especially so in the Monthly Magazine, for the great majority of contributed pieces there are signed with initials or with what appear to be the writers’ real names; thematic names of the kind she used in these pieces are infrequent. 28 Barbauld also once signed an essay with initials that were not her own: her letter to the Gentleman’s Magazine defending Edgeworth, signed "Y.Z."—perhaps in telonymic allusion to her real initials, "A.B." A signature composed of initials not her own may thus be hers, especially if it can be seen as wittily allusive or as referring in some way to Addison’s practice in The Spectator. Addison, Barbauld knew, signed his essays with one of the four letters composing the name "Clio." 29 Her signature "Balance" in the manners essay alludes to an Addison essay, "The Balance. A Vision" ( Spectator 463), included in her Selections. But many pieces (most, in fact, of those that first appeared in the Monthly Magazine) she did not sign at all. The absence of signature, then, does not exclude the possibility that a piece is hers. A further ground of attribution has been suggested to me by Scott Krawczyk : indications that a piece published in a magazine edited by John Aikin (the Monthly and the Athenaeum ) enters into dialogue with, or is engaged in dialogue by, a piece known to be by Aikin. An example would be "Thoughts on Prophecy" (A5 below), which is answered by Aikin’s "Literary Prophecies for 1797 " Such dialogical behavior was typical for Anna Letitia and her brother, joint authors as they were of a volume, Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, in which two of the essays 27 On "profiling" see Love, Attributing Authorship, p. 87. The Furbank -Owens canon is criticized by Maximillian Novak in Daniel Defoe: Master of Fictions (Oxford, 2001), pp. 4–5. 28 A count of the 342 signatures in the Monthly Magazine’s first two volumes yielded 168 composed of initials and 75 that at least appear to be real names. At most, 36 of the signatures could be called "speaking names," and that includes many of the "A Constant Reader" type. In the Morning Chronicle speaking names are more common. Its proprietor, James Perry, wrote short essays and poems himself (ODNB): hence humorous pieces in the Chronicle on the manners and politics of the day signed with comic thematic names cannot be attributed to Barbauld with any confidence. An example of such a piece is a letter signed "Harry Head-Ache, Q. M. G." and dated from "Camomile-Street" (6 Jan. 1796). 29 "Preliminary Essay," Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder ( London , 1804), 1:xxxii. (one by her and one by him) play off Edmund Burke’s theories of the Sublime and the Beautiful. 30 Humor and manners were not Barbauld ’s only essay modes and subjects; she also regarded grave and serious subjects as suitable to essays, "if treated concisely." "Fashion, a Vision," is allegorical rather than humorous, and rises to a pitch of intensity not aimed at by her "Letter of John Bull" or "Letter on Watering-Places"; "What Is Education?" and "On Prejudice" are serious inquiries into their subjects. In short, an unsigned essay or an essay signed with initials or thematic name, humorous or serious, may be a candidate for the Barbauld canon if it appears in a journal to which she contributed with some regularity. While these criteria have helped me to identify pieces as candidates, every such piece must be examined independently for more precise indications of Barbauld ’s authorship. One such indication might be thought to be gender: Does an unclaimed piece "sound like" the work of a man or a woman? At best, this criterion could only be negative, invoked to exclude a candidate from the Barbauld canon; indeed, it might not serve even that purpose. Male reviewers such as William Woodfall perceived Barbauld ’s verse, at least, as "masculine"; they compared it to Shakespeare’s and Milton’s. Maria Edgeworth thought she could tell Barbauld ’s prose style by its moderate classicism: "I think I should be able to distinguish her style from that of any other female writer by the ease, frequency, and felicity of its classical allusions—allusions sufficiently intelligible to the unlearned, and which serve as freemason signs to the learned." 31 I share Edgeworth’s impression of Barbauld ’s style, subjective though it is; statistical analysis of a large body of magazine writing from the period might refine and confirm it, but I am neither competent nor situated to undertake such a project. One example of attribution—or, as it turned out, de-attribution—by comparing textual allusions was undertaken at my request in 1989 by Carey McIntosh . The text in question was Reasons for National Penitence (1794), an anti-war tract attributed to Barbauld in several library catalogues but to her pupil, Charles Marsh , on the flyleaf of one copy. Its style resembles hers in Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, written for the first wartime fast as Reasons was for the second. Professor McIntosh examined allusions in both works and found that while Barbauld in Sins alludes frequently to Bible texts (indeed, the motto for Sins comes from Deuteronomy), the author of Reasons never does: Reasons alludes, rather, to Tacitus, 30 The essays are her "Inquiry into those Kinds of Distress which excite agreeable Sensations" (about feeling pity for distressed Beauty) and John’s "On the Pleasure derived from Objects of Terror" (Terror, in Burke, is a source of the Sublime). Anna Letitia writes on the "feminine" aspect of Burke’s theory, John on the "masculine" aspect. See ALBVE, p. 112, and the chapters on the Aikins’ collaboration in Krawczyk’s Romantic Literary Families ( New York , 2009). The fact that Barbauld and her brother did collaborate can complicate attribution: On at least one occasion, writing a story for John’s son Arthur , they wrote jointly (ALBVE, p. 190). Ordinarily, however, their collaboration was conceptual rather than executional; hence I aim to identify Barbauld as (to use Harold Love’s term) the "executive" author, the person who actually wrote the text. An example of attribution rendered uncertain by their conceptual agreement is "Remarks on Versification," B16 below. 31 Quoted in ALBVE, pp. 356–357. For male reviewers, see pp. 110 and 118. three times. 32 Barbauld ’s one Latinism in Sins does support Edgeworth’s impression: she quotes "pars minima sui" and translates it in the same sentence. Lowkey classicism may thus be a genuine, albeit hardly sufficient, sign of Barbauld ’s authorship. (It would not follow, however, that the presence of untranslated Latin must exclude the possibility of Barbauld ’s authorship, for she quoted two lines of Latin verse without translation in one of her most popular essays, "Against Inconsistency in our Expectations" [1773].) A. Uncollected Pieces Of the following thirty-three titles, nineteen are identified as Barbauld ’s by signature, her testimony, or a credible witness, and one was reprinted (in part) by Lucy Aikin. Thirteen of them I attribute to Barbauld myself. They are marked by asterisks. A1. "The Vision of Anna, the Daughter of Haikin." The Christian Miscellany, No. 4 (April 1792), pp. 157—161, as "Art. VIII. A Chapter of Modern Apocrypha." Unsigned. Reprinted in the Christian Reformer; or, Unitarian Magazine and Review, 39 (1853): 111-114, as "An Unedited Parable of Mrs. Barbauld ." According to Joseph Priestley editor J. T. Rutt, the Christian Miscellany was undertaken by Joshua Toulmin, Jr. with encouragement from Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey (Priestley, Theological and Miscellaneous Works, London , 1828—31, 1.ii, p. 88 and note); according to historian R. K. Webb , it was "founded" by Priestley follower John Holland (1766-1826; ODNB entry on Holland ). Although Lindsey and Priestley had criticized Barbauld ’s 1775 "Thoughts on the Devotional Taste," her Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Tests Acts (1790) had won the admiration of liberal Dissent. The Miscellany's editor dates the "Vision" to 1773, following two failed petitions by Dissenting ministers to obtain "relief from the obligation to subscribe the doctrinal articles of the church of England"; he also notes parallels between passages in it and in the Address to the Opposers. If the editor was John Holland , his source for "Vision" could have been his brother-in-law William Turner , a Warrington Academy graduate who wrote the first history of the academy and collected copies of Barbauld poems. "Haikin" is a Biblicization of Barbauld ’s birth name; whether it is her title or the editor’s is not known, but Barbauld imitated the style of the King James Version on other occasions, most famously Hymns in Prose. 33 The 1853 editor provides further details about the 1773 petitions and regrets that "Miss [Lucy] Aikin did not admit 32 Professor McIntosh compared three samples: one from Sins, one from Reasons, and one from an unidentified text I knew to be by Marsh (personal correspondence with me; see ALBVE, pp. 184 and 632n94). The Beinecke Library copy of Reasons (Mhc8.1794.M35) bears a flyleaf attribution to "my old fellow-student at New Coll. Hackney — C. Marsh." "Hackney" is Hackney College, which Marsh attended after leaving Barbauld ’s school at Palgrave. He went on to argue for Deism as a member of the Tusculan Society, a debating-club at Norwich (Minutes, 11 Oct. 1793; Norfolk Record Office); hence he would not have been likely to quote Scripture. 33 In 1772, the year before the date claimed for this piece, Barbauld wrote a piece in imitation biblical prose on the departure from Warrington of her friends the Edwardses ( Ann Weld commonplace book, MS POST 1650 MS 0335, Univ. of Illinois). It has not been published. this composition into the collected works of her aunt. ... We have reasons for believing that it is known to very few persons." See also ALBVE, pp. 144–145. A2. *["The Domiphobia, or Dread of Home."] Monthly Magazine, 1 (May 1796): 268–270. Signed "C." and " Warwick Lane , MAY 9th." In the guise of a physician, the writer treats the fashion for visiting watering–places in summer as if it were a medical condition ( Warwick Lane in London was home to physicians). Barbauld wrote a "Letter on Watering-Places" (the piece signed " Henry Homelove ") and was fond of medical terminology (see, e.g., Poem 29 in Poems of Anna Letitia Barbauld , about her brother, who practiced medicine), although none of her known works matches this piece for sheer jargon. 34 She also regarded the fad for taking summer holidays as if it were a spell cast upon Britons (ALBVE, pp. 389 and 643n2); and she speaks of the fashion for summer tours and "sea bathing–places " again in "Comparison of Manners" (A17, p. 114). The signature "C." could be her imitation of Addison’s signature practice. A3. *[" Mr. Roscoe’s Lorenzo de Medici."] Monthly Magazine, 2 (July 1796): 443–445. Signed "X.Y.Z." and dated July 15, 1796. The essay claims (ironically) to disbelieve William Roscoe’s biography, for his Lorenzo is immeasurably more intellectual and public-spirited than the wealthy of today. The writer mentions Francis Hutcheson’s theory of ethics, as does Barbauld in her Remarks on Gilbert Wakefield’s Enquiry into ... Public Worship (1792); also William Paley , whose View of the Evidences of Christianity (1794) she read with one of her pupils in 1811; Paley is also praised in Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (line 89). The writer also compliments Samuel Rogers , "the banker-poet," whom Barbauld knew and liked; and quotes a couplet from Addison’s Cato (I.iv) containing the words "as it runs refines" (cf. Barbauld ’s Hymn VIII, "refining as we run," and her liking for Addison). Barbauld was sent a copy of Roscoe’s Lorenzo in April 1796, for which she thanked Roscoe on 3 April (MS 920 ROS 5800, Liverpool Record Office); ten days after the date of this essay, she reports that she has been reading Lorenzo and calls it "a very capital work" (to Judith Beecroft , 25 July 1796). A4. *[Letter on William Taylor’s translation of Bürger’s "Lenore."] Monthly Magazine, 2 (September 1796): 601. Signed "B." and dated Sept. 3, 1796. The writer rebuts Taylor’s claim for Bürger’s originality (in MM, 1 [March 1796]: 118) by paralleling "Lenore" with two English ballads from a 1723 collection, "The Suffolk Miracle" and " William’s Ghost ," and deprecates "the vindictive justice of God" in Leonora’s fate (cf. Barbauld ’s rejection of the Calvinist God in Remarks on Public Worship); but also declares Taylor’s translation "in parts equal to any composition I have ever read." Taylor was Barbauld ’s pupil at Palgrave School; she kept in touch with him, admiring his talent and sometimes chiding him for not exploiting it. She read his "Leonora" aloud to a gathering 34 But medical terminology alone would be insufficient evidence of her authorship: See the Morning Chronicle piece signed "Harry Head-Ache" (n. 26 above). of Dugald Stewart’s friends at Edinburgh in 1794, to great acclaim (ALBVE, pp. 364–365) . A5. *["Thoughts on Prophecy. Prophecies for 1797."] Monthly Magazine, 3 (January 1797): 5–8. Signed "Old Lilly," without date or place. This piece is answered by John Aikin’s "Literary Prophecies for 1797" (MM, 3:91–92). It is political in its allusions to current and recent events, such as the war and the Birmingham Riot ("if we had foreseen, that opinion can be combated only with opinion," alluding to Priestley’s 1791 expostulation "To the Inhabitants of the Town of Birmingham"). The writer characterizes war as "the murder of thousands ... with whom he had no dispute" (cf. Civic Sermon I: "to fight and kill people whom you never quarreled with"); quotes a passage containing the phrase "rise like exhalations" (adapted from Milton; Barbauld quoted the original in a letter to John Aikin, January 1784, describing a balloon); predicts that new novels will be condemned by reviewers but "read with pleasure and approbation" in places occupied typically by women (cf. Barbauld ’s defense of fiction in "On the Origin and Progress of Novel-Writing" in British Novelists [1810]); and predicts "a most grotesque fashion in dress" (cf. Barbauld ’s critique of grotesque fashions in "On Fashion"). "Old Lilly" presumably alludes to William Lilly (1602-81), astrologer and pamphleteering prophet. A6. * ["Consolation for Ideal Calamities."] Monthly Magazine, 3 (February 1797): 96–97, signed "Solomon Sympathy" and dated "Feb. 10." The "ideal calamities" are those of daily life among the genteel classes ("men of fashion, women of ton, and persons of distinction") regarded by philosophers as beneath notice: missing a ball, losing one’s gloves, not getting a place at a play. The piece teeters between irony and sympathy, as Barbauld often does (for example, in her letter to the Norwich Iris defending Priestley, A15 below), and it takes much the same view of daily pains and pleasures as she was to assert in "Thoughts on the Inequality of Conditions": "I know very well," she writes there, that philosophers "can prove by many learned and logical arguments that external goods have nothing to do with happiness. ... We are therefore bound to believe that these gentlemen, though they appear to enjoy a good table, or an elegant carriage as well as their neighbours, in fact regard them with perfect indifference" ( SPP, p. 346). This writer remarks, in similar vein, that "not one of those philosophers and divines who have made the afflictions of human life their study, have condescended to say one word" about the sufferings caused by things like rancid butter, spoiled meat, and over-baked pies. The writer also quotes Oliver Goldsmith twice, including a line ("all the decent manliness of grief") from The Deserted Village, one of Barbauld ’s most favorite poems: she declared she would "never be tired" of re-reading it ( ALBVE, pp. 105 and 580n22). A7. *["Character of a Wife."] Monthly Magazine, 3 (March 1797): 182–185. Signed "Humphrey Placid" and dated March 4, 1797. The case for attribution is mainly biographical: "Humphrey"’s description of the "wife"’s behavior parallels the behavior of Barbauld ’s husband, Rochemont. "[R]est is unknown at our house": "She" is constantly in motion, constantly remodeling and rebuilding. Rochemont’s restlessness was noticed by Barbauld friends, and Lucy Aikin spoke of his "crazy habits." 35 "Humphrey" suspects that the "wife" would enjoy being busied by a Chancery suit; Rochemont instituted a Chancery suit in 1799, regarding a loan he had made to a certain John Harvey Pierce (ALBVE, pp. 362–363). "Hope and Fear" are the motives attributed to the "wife"; these could equate with mania and depression, or the early and later stages of mania alone (see ALBVE, Appendix B). The "wife" suspects the servants of dishonesty; that would be consistent with mania going over into paranoia. We do not know whether Rochemont suspected his servants of dishonesty, but in his 1799 lawsuit he accused John Harvey Pierce of dishonesty–an accusation not sustained by the Chancery judge. The "wife" has also "been studying the new doctrine of perfectability, which ... she transfers from mind to matter"; Rochemont adopted the doctrine of a progressive deity whose aim was to perfect the universe (see his "Essay on the Divine Wisdom" and ALBVE, p. 221). The "wife" delights in taking on other people’s problems and giving aid; Barbauld wrote of Rochement that "his heart overflowed with kindness to all" ("Memoir of the Rev. R. Barbauld "). The writer mentions Hampstead, where the Barbauld s lived in 1797; the name "Humphrey," a family name in Barbauld ’s birthplace, might have been recalled from her childhood. The fictional mask—a husband complaining of his wife’s eccentric behavior—is identical to that in Barbauld ’s "Letter of John Bull" and similar to " Henry Homelove "’s complaint about his wife and daughters. Although "Humphrey" attempts to assimilate the "wife" to that figure of comedy the "notable woman," the behavior described is much more idiosyncratic and does not appear allegorical, as " Mrs. Bull’s " does; the purported satire is correspondingly much narrower in its application. A reference to "my property ... in the West Indies" is not consistent with Barbauld ’s authorship, but she knew people from Warrington Academy who owned property in the Indies. Even allowing for comic exaggeration, this piece would appear to give an unrivalled idea of Barbauld ’s home life with her husband. A8. *["Defence of Rhyme."] Monthly Magazine, 3 (May 1797): 335—336. Signed "Cosmo." The writer replies to an "unmerciful attack" on rhyme in the Monthly ("Is Rhyme an Ornament, or a Defect, in Verse," MM 3:273—277). The writer defends rhyme in terms very like those of Barbauld ’s preface to a Cadell and Davies reprint of William Collins (1797), even calling Collins’s unrhymed "Ode to Evening" unsatisfactory to "the ear," as her preface does. The writer claims to be "not unacquainted with the toil and vexation" of rhyming. The type of argument–stating the opponent’s objection, conceding it, and then refuting it by showing that its application would be intolerably wide–is employed in Barbauld’s Remarks on Public Worship ( London , 1792): "The exercises of devotion, Mr. Wakefield says, are wearisome. Suppose they were so, how many meetings do we frequent, to how many conversations do we listen with benevolent attention, 35 Quoted in Anna Letitia Le Breton, Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld ( London , 1874), p. 44. where our own pleasure and ... improvement are not the objects to which our time is given up?" (pp. 50–51). Compare "But rhyme is a shackle. Doubtless it is; and so is verse—so is harmonious prose—so is every thing which obliges the writer to exertions superior to those of common language." Barbauld agreed in March or April 1797 to introduce a reprint of Collins’s poems ( ALBVE, p. 368), so she had occasion to think about rhyme—and Collins—aside from the Monthly’s article. A9. "On the Progressive Lateness of Hours kept in England." Monthly Magazine, 6 (July 1798): 4–6. Unsigned. Barbauld occasionally complains of late hours in her letters (e.g., to John Aikin , [January 1783] and 21 January 1784). The writer mentions English "reserve," as Barbauld does (see ALBVE, pp. 46 and 566n28); repeats the same anecdote about the Duchess of Devonshire’s idea of "morning" that Barbauld reported to John Aikin (31 January 1787); quotes Genesis humorously ( Barbauld liked Biblical quotations, and was not above applying them humorously); and quotes from Paradise Lost the same line ("the touch of Ithuriel’s spear") in the same kind of application as Barbauld does in her Address to the Opposers. The writer refers also to a " Spectator " essay which complained that "when the fashion of undressing prevailed amongst the ladies ... the neck was surprisingly grown, and stretched out to half the body." This appears to recall not the Spectator but the Guardian, No. 100: "The disuse of the Tucker has still enlarged it [the neck], insomuch that the Neck of a fine woman at present takes in almost half the Body." 36 Barbauld ’s later "Comparison of Manners in Two Centuries" alludes to Guardian No. 100, addresses the subject of late hours in nearly the same words as the present essay, and quotes from Tatler 263 a sentence very similar to a sentence in the present essay; she included extracts from Tatler 263 on late hours and from Guardian 100 in her Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder (I:144–148; 3:245–247).John Dixon, father of Barbauld ’s Norwich friend Judith Dixon Beecroft, attributed this essay to Barbauld in a manuscript album he kept (Folger M.a. 58). See ALBVE, p. 614n1. A10. [Obituary of Thomas Mulso .] Monthly Magazine, 7 (February 1799): 163. Unsigned. Reprinted in the Gentleman’s Magazine, 69 (March 1799): 254, and John Nichols , Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century 9 ( London , 1815): 492–493. Barbauld acknowledged authorship in a letter to the Rev. Mark Noble, 26 October 1804. See ALBVE, p. 682, for citation. A11. *["Essay, Medical, Moral, Political &amp; Miscellaneous, on Spirits."] Monthly Magazine, 7 (February 1799): 89–92. Signed "Geoffry Gauger, Excise-Office, Feb. 12, 1799." Opens with ironic reflections on the government’s excise tax on alcohol ("spirits"), and develops into a political allegory on other kinds of spirits: "Spirit of Contradiction," "Spirit of Innovation," "Spirit of Reform," "Spirit of Religion," and "Spirit of Bigotry." The manner of the allegory resembles that of Barbauld ’s 36 Thanks to Professor Alfred Lutz (Middle Tennessee University) for this reference. "Cosmogunia" dialogue. The writer uses chemical and medical terminology, including "alterative," a technical word Barbauld uses in "On Education" and her letter defending Edgeworth . 37 The writer alludes to the Birmingham Riot ("answer a pamphlet by burning a house"), is sympathetic to moderate political reform and mild versions of religion, and deplores "Bigotry." The writer "once flattered myself I understood" the "Spirit of Liberty": this could allude to Barbauld’s political writings in the early 90s. A12. *"Sketch of Two Brothers. Addressed to the Quidnuncs." Monthly Magazine, 8 (October 1799): 681–683. Signed "C." Reprinted in The Spirit of the Public Journals for 1800 ( London , 1801), pp. 106–109, without attribution. The two brothers are "Prior" and "Posterior"; Prior loves "a good story," while Posterior "is a plain matter-of-fact man." A satire on gossips and news-fanatics, this essay contains a mock-genealogy similar to those in Barbauld’s "Tale of Pity" and "Knowledge and Her Daughter." The writer is critical of gossip that bandies about numbers of killed and wounded as if they were equivalent to shares prices, much as Barbauld ’s poem "Written on a Marble" satirically likens the Battle of Pharsalia to a game at marbles and her Sins of Government reduces military budgets to "merchandized destruction": "so many rupees. ..." A13. "Memoirs of Mrs. Chapone." Monthly Magazine, 13 (January 1802): 39–40. Signed "A.L.B." and "Hampstead" (where Barbauld was living at the time). Partly reprinted in Mary Hays, Female Biography, attributed to Barbauld ; also Weekly Entertainer, or, Agreeable and Instructive Repository, 39 (March 1802): 170–172. Barbauld acknowledged authorship to Mark Noble, 26 October 1804. A14. ["Opprobrious Appellations reprobated."] Monthly Magazine, 14 (December 1802): 480–482. Signed "A.L.B." Replies to "Orthophilus" ( John Aikin ) on the words rebel and infidel (MM, 14 [November 1802]: 376-377). A15. "To the Editor of the Iris." [Letter defending Joseph Priestley from a satire, "Hudibras Modernized."] Norwich Iris, No. 47, 24 December 1803. Signed "A Lover of Truth." The Iris was edited by William Taylor (1765–1836), Barbauld ’s former pupil at Palgrave School; Taylor was also the author of the satire against which "A Lover of Truth" protests, and his response to the letter resembles that of a pupil rebuked by his teacher: he printed the letter and cut short the satire. This letter is attributed to Barbauld by Taylor’s biographer, J. W. Robberds (Memoir of the Life and Writings of the late William Taylor of Norwich [ London , 1843], 2:3–4). Internal evidence for attribution is the letter’s expressed view of Priestley, consistent with her poem "Champion of Truth." See ALBVE, pp. 72–73. 37 SPP, pp. 332, 462. However, a search of Eighteenth-Century Collections Online on 6 August 2014 produced over fifteen hundred occurrences of alterative in eighteenth-century books, twenty-five of the books from 1799 alone; hence the word, though used by Barbauld and rare today, cannot be considered a hallmark of her style. A16. *["Remarks on the Principle of Credulity."] Monthly Magazine, 16 (December 1803): 504–505. Signed "* * *". Denies Thomas Reid’s and Dugald Stewart’s theory of an instinctive "principle of credulity"; argues, instead, that children’s disposition to believe their elders is a result of experience. Illustrates with sentences spoken by adults to children, as in Lessons for Children. Closes with an anecdote of Reid "told me by my father, who was acquainted with him." Barbauld ’s father had known Reid in college at Aberdeen ( William Turner , The Warrington Academy [1813–15, rpt. Warrington , 1957], p. 13). A17. ["Comparison of Manners in Two Centuries."] Athenaeum, 1 (January and February 1807): 1–10, 111–121. Signed (latter piece only) "Balance." Attributed by Kenrick and, implicitly, by John Aikin , the Athenaeum ’s editor (discussed above). A18. "The Contrast; or Peace and War." Athenaeum, 1 (January 1807): 14–15. Signed "A.L.B." A19. "Thoughts on the Inequality of Conditions." Athenaeum, 2 (July 1807): 14–19. Signed "A.L.B." Reprinted, attributed to Barbauld , in the London Cooperative Magazine, 3 (1828): 132–138. A20. *"A Day-Dream." Athenaeum, 2 (December 1807): 563–565. Signed "A Day-dreamer." A dream vision in which the narrator’s associates are transformed into beasts. As in Barbauld’s Address to the Opposers, the angel Ithuriel makes people appear in their true shapes, here in answer to the narrator’s wish that people had "a window in their bosoms" through which their "real dispositions" could be read. Ithuriel tells the narrator that "the friend of thy bosom has been the destroyer of thy peace," a statement that would describe Barbauld ’s life with her husband. Further, the sharp contrast between the charming and the bestial in the narrator’s associates would correspond to the contrast between Rochemont Barbauld ’s sub-manic and paranoid states. In her 1804 Selections from Addison and Steele Barbauld included Guardian No. 106, about a "window in the breast" through which the narrator can read his beloved’s true thoughts. A21. "Memoir of the Rev. R. Barbauld ." Monthly Repository, 3 (December 1808): 706–709. Unsigned. Partly reprinted in Lucy Aikin’s "Memoir" of Barbauld , in Works, 1:xlv-xlix. A22. *"Truth and Fiction in Manners Compared." Athenaeum, 5 (February 1809): 106–109. Signed "Crito." Argues in favor of fictions that render historical manners realistically even when those manners fail to meet current ideas of morality. The writer compares Robert Southey’s translation of the Cid, in which historical manners are observed, favorably with Corneille’s Cid, in which they are not; Barbauld makes the same comparison in very similar words in "On the Origin and Progress of Novel-Writing" a year later (SPP, p. 387). The writer approves of Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel and Marmion. Barbauld had reviewed The Lay appreciatively: "it abounds ... with circumstances curious to the antiquarian" (Annual Review, 3 [1805]: 600–604). In 1809 Barbauld was at work on The British Novelists and thus concerned with fiction. A23. ["Miss Anne Finch."] Monthly Repository, 4 (March 1809): 171–172. Signed "Stoke Newington" (where ALB was living in 1809). Anne Finch was the granddaughter of Joseph Priestley . This obituary is attributed to Barbauld by J. T. Rutt , editor of Priestley's Memoirs (in Priestley, Theological and Miscellaneous Works, 1.i, p. 49n). The lines of verse that close the obituary, however, are from a poem by John Aikin . A24. [Letter defending Maria Edgeworth's tale "The Dun" from aspersions by the Quarterly Review .] Gentleman's Magazine, 80 (March 1810): 210–212. Signed"Y.Z." Barbauld acknowledged to Edgeworth having written such a letter (Anna Letitia Le Breton, Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, London , 1874, pp. 144–145). A25. "A Dialogue on our Obligation to study the Scriptures, and to act on the Motives which they prescribe, even though their Divine Origin should be uncertain." Monthly Repository, 8 (February 1813): 103–107. Unsigned. Claimed on p. 650 ("my Dialogue") of the "Vindication" (below), which is signed "A.L.B." A26. "Vindication of the Dialogue on the Scriptures in Reply to Mr. Sturch." Monthly Repository, 8 (October and November 1813): 650–653, 738–741 Signed "A.L.B." 38 A27. "Memoir of the late Rev. John Prior Estlin , LL.D." Monthly Repository, 12 (October 1817): 573–575. Signed "A. L. B." and "Stoke Newington, September 22nd, 1817." Reprinted in Monthly Magazine, 44 (1817): 566–568; partly incorporated in the memoir prefacing Estlin's Familiar Lectures on Moral Philosophy ( London , 1818), 1:[xi]–xxxi. Attributed to Barbauld by J. T. Rutt in his edition of Priestley's Memoirs (1.i, p. 420n). Estlin was a friend of Barbauld's from Warrington . His widow asked her to write his obituary, and Barbauld agreed to do so (letter to Susanna Estlin , 27 August [1817]; Estlin Papers, Bristol Reference Library). A28. *["Fellowship of Unitarian Congregations."] Monthly Repository, 13 (May 1818): 303–304. Signed "A Social Worshiper" and dated April 12, 1818. 38. The liberal Unitarian William Sturch had replied to the "Dialogue" in the Repository, 8 (May 1813): 297–300. Chides wealthy Unitarians for lack of fellowship towards their fellow-congregants. Quotes Barbauld's Hymn VI (lines 5–9); the signature may allude to Barbauld's Remarks on ... Public or Social Worship (1792), in which she had argued that part of the value of social worship lies in its bringing into one community people of widely different ranks. She was said by a contemporary to have called Unitarianism "Christianity in the frigid zone" (ALBVE, p. 153); her ideal of social worship included the human warmth among worshipers argued for by this writer, who censures heads of Unitarian congregations for "coolness and callousness"—and in doing so argues further that by their coolness Unitarians injure their own prospects as a sect. A29. "On Being Born Again: A Discourse by the late Mrs. Barbauld." Monthly Repository, n.s. I (July 1827): 477–482. Reprinted as American Unitarian Association Tract 13, A Discourse on Being Born Again. By Mrs. Barbauld ( Boston , 1827; 2nd ed., 1830). Introduced by Barbauld's nephew and adopted son, Charles Rochemont Aikin . A page of the autograph survives today (MS Corbett II.7, University of Birmingham Library). A30. "New Year Discourse. By Mrs. Barbauld." Monthly Repository, n.s. 2 (January 1828): 1–5. A31. "A Discourse, by Mrs. Barbauld." Monthly Repository, n.s. 2 (March 1828): 145–149. A32. "A Discourse, by Mrs. Barbauld." Monthly Repository, n.s. 2 (June 1828): 361–367. A33. "The Misses (addressed to a careless girl.) By the late Mrs. Barbauld." The Juvenile Forget Me Not ... for the Year 1830, ed. Mrs. S. C. [ Anna Maria ] Hall. London : N. Hailes [1829]. Pp. 1–8. Reprinted in three American newspapers: Louisville Public Advertiser, 19 February 1830; Southern Times ( Columbia , SC), 19 April 1830; and [North] Carolina Observer, 13 May 1830; and by Grace Ellis , A Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, with many of her Letters ( Boston , 1874), 2:374–380. The Literary Gazette, mindful of Lucy Aikin's rebuke to the Amulet for publishing two Barbauld comic poems, rebuked the Juvenile Forget Me Not for printing "The Misses": Barbauld's "nearest relatives have requested us to reclaim ... against the growing practice of obtaining and publishing productions intended for the private circles and occasions which called them forth" (12 December 1829, p. 813; see n. 16 above). Their request amounts to an acknowledgement of Barbauld's authorship. In 1834 Hall (1800–81), as if stung by the Aikins' rebuke, justified her having published "The Misses": "It was written by a very excellent lady, who, I am grieved to say, is dead; one to whom I, as well as thousands of others, owe a deep debt of gratitude, for her books afforded me a great deal of instruction when I was a little girl" (A.M.H., "The 'Not' Family," Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, no. 114 [5 April 1834]: 80). B. Possible Attributions Below is a list of twenty titles I believe more or less likely to be Barbauld's for reasons given in each case, but which I attribute with less confidence than I do the thirteen above. The differences between those thirteen and these twenty consist sometimes of counter-indications (as in the first entry below) and often simply of quantity: reasons in favor of attribution, although of the same kind as reasons for the first group, are simply fewer in number. I list these titles in the hope that further evidence one way or the other may surface. In the present state of my knowledge I would probably exclude them from a collected works, albeit in several instances reluctantly. B1. "To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle." [Letter rebutting Ministerial allegations that Dissenters have been intimidated by the Birmingham Riots.] Signed "A DISSENTER." Morning Chronicle, 28 July 1791. Reprinted in An Authentic Account of the Riots in Birmingham (1791), pp. 58–63; and as a pamphlet (ESTC T220698). Besides bearing the same signature as Barbauld's Address to the Opposers, a signature seemingly little used in the 1780s and 90s, 39 this essay takes the same tone of dignified expostulation, rebuts the charge that Dissenters are discouraged by defeat (cf. Address, in SPP, p. 276), answers the charge that Dissenters talk sedition by noting that the government does not outlaw such talk (it would do so a year later), and predicts that even if Dissenters were banished from the nation, men asserting the same principles would "start up, out of the bosom of the Church of England" (cf. Address, in SPP, pp. 274–276, where Barbauld cites defections from the Church of England by thinking men). On the other hand, the writer quotes a Roman historian, just as the author of Reasons for National Penitence does; the writer could, once again, be Barbauld's pupil Charles Marsh , at age 17 emulating his teacher. B2. ["Meditations on a General Election."] Monthly Magazine, I (June 1796): 379–380. Signed "C." and dated "June 8, 1796." An ironic comment on the professions of humility and desire to serve the public made in newspaper ads by candidates for Parliament; the writer pretends to take them seriously and to be deeply moved by the Christian virtues they display. The essay makes medical allusions; also, its exposition opens with "And, first," a phrase Barbauld uses in the same way in "Thoughts on the Devotional Taste": "And, in the first place" (SPP, p. 213). B3. ["On the Characteristics of Poetry."] Monthly Magazine, 2 (August 1796): 532–534. Signed "Philo-Rhythmus" and dated 8 August 1796. 39. A search of the online Burney Collection of British Newspapers turned up only six instances of "A Dissenter" as a signature between 1 Jan. 1787 and 31 Dec. 1793. The search engine is not trustworthy, however, for it failed to turn up the very piece here in question. Responds to a Monthly essay, "Is Verse essential to Poetry?" (MM, 2:453–456). The writer quotes Pope; mentions historians Rapin, Tindal, Tacitus and Hume; deprecates "as spurious" attempts to write poetical prose such as Macpherson's; and criticizes blank verse as "scarcely" distinct from prose. These views are consistent with those in the "Defence of Rhyme" by "Cosmo" that I attribute to Barbauld (A8) and with her preface to the poems of Collins (1797). Against attribution is the fact that Barbauld had published an imitation of Macpherson herself in Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose. However, she had also written blank verse, and continued to write it even after repudiating it in her Collins preface; inconsistency between precept and act need not discredit an attribution. B4. ["Similitude of Domestic and National Politics."] Monthly Magazine, 4 (October 1797): 274–275, signed "C.C.C." and dated "Oct. 10." Argues that lessons of political wisdom can be learned in the government of families. The politics urged here are egalitarian, consistently with the politics urged in Sins of Government and Civic Sermons. The writer urges that laws be few and easily understood (cf. Remarks on Public Worship in Works, 2:463) and uses two phrases used by Barbauld: "And, first" (cf. above, "Meditations on a General Election") and "For this plain reason" (cf. Civic Sermon II). But "C.C.C." could stand for "Corpus Christi College"; the writer could be a student or fellow there. B5. ["Rhapsody on Newspapers."] Monthly Magazine, 5 (January 1798): 5–7. Signed "Rhapsodicus." Reprinted in The Spirit of the Public Journals for 1798, without attribution. Taking rise from debates in Parliament whether or not to tax newspapers, the writer argues, ironically, that newspapers are articles of necessity, and describes the habits of their readers. The writer quotes one of Barbauld's favorite passages, Bacon's "come home to men's business and bosoms"; also a line from Shakespeare, "Confirmations strong / As proofs of holy writ" ( Othello, III.iii.323). The writer takes the same view of war as Barbauld does in Sins of Government and elsewhere. In her Selections from The Spectator Barbauld reprinted No. 452, by Addison, on newspapers. B6. ["Evils from a Prize in the Lottery."] Monthly Magazine, 5 (March 1798): 162–165, signed "David Dip. Whitechapel High-street, March 10, 1798." Reprinted in The Spirit of the Public Journals for 1798, without attribution; and in The British Prose Miscellany (Huddersfield, 1799?), as by "David Dip." As in "Letter of John Bull ," the writer complains of a wife's bad behavior: she won a lottery, and then insisted that the Dip family live "like people of fashion." Written in the supposed voice of a shopkeeper, the essay drops a few unsophisticated platitudes similar to those uttered by the mother cat in Barbauld's "Letter from Grimalkin to Selima": "But happiness will have an end. There are many ups and downs in life" (cf. in "Grimalkin": "Honesty you will find is the best policy" [SPP, p. 357]). In opposing lotteries, the writer opposes the government lottery designed to raise money for the war. Barbauld included a "Story of a Lottery Ticket" from Spectator No. 242 in her 1804 Selections; in it, a husband mistreats his wife over a ticket. B7. ["Evils of Modern Matrimony."] Monthly Magazine, 5 (May 1798): 322–324. Signed "C.C." Responds to a rash of divorce scandals ("crim. cons.," as they were called) by advocating (ironically) that wives be locked up to prevent their infidelity. "It is in vain to think that people will not abuse liberty, if they have it." Pretends to long for the good old days when women had to be courted by stealth, at the risk of the lover's life. The essay quotes Bacon's "comes home to men's bosoms and business" and introduces its arguments with "And first," as Barbauld does in "Thoughts on the Devotional Taste." B8. ["On the Tie of Relationship."] Monthly Magazine, 5 (June 1798): 410–411. Signed "Aristippus" and dated 2 June 1798. A serious essay on the relative duties that attend different degrees of human relations. "Tie" is a favorite Barbauld word (cf., most famously, "the sacred tie that binds" in "Hymn VI"). The writer shares Barbauld's Hutchesonian belief that human relations begin with one's kin and "ultimately" reach "to all who participate in the same common nature" (cf. Hymn VIII in Hymns in Prose). The writer quotes Francis Bacon, but not Barbauld's usual Bacon phrase, and in Latin, not English. B9. ["On Parental Tyranny."] Monthly Magazine, 5 (June 1798): 421–422. Signed "'O." and dated May 8, "1797. " The writer has read a memoir of Johann Georg Zimmermann in which Zimmermann is said to have lamented the death of a beloved daughter whose desire to marry the man of her choice Zimmermann thwarted. Zimmermann's suffering over his daughter's decline is mentioned in The Life of J. G. Zimmermann , Counsellor of State.... Translatedfrom the French of M. Tissot ( London , 1797), but Zimmermann's own more detailed—and paternalist—account of his daughter's character and death appears in his Solitude considered, in Regard to its Influence upon the Mind and the Heart ( London and Edinburgh , 1797), pp. 99–103. He does not state outright that her decline resulted from thwarted desire; the author of "On Parental Tyranny" assumes it, and argues thence that the true parental tyranny is exerted out of love and that the child submits to it from unwillingness to defy a beloved parent. The essay is thus a critique of paternalism. The idea of a daughter's love being thought unsuitable was close to Barbauld's heart, for, having defied her parents' wishes in marrying Rochemont, she came to suffer remorse for doing so. B10. ["Environs of Bristol Described."] Monthly Magazine, 7 (July 1799): 448–451. Signed "A.B." and dated June 4. Barbauld visited Bristol in June 1799, but unless she had knowledge from previous visits the 4th seems too early for her to have written a paper about it. In 1812 she wrote admiringly of Bristol to Sarah Carr (ALBVE, p. 397), mentioning St Vincent's Rocks, as this writer does. This writer quotes more Latin than I would expect from Barbauld and is almost pedantic in describing local geology and flora, but Barbauld did notice rocks in a cave at Bridgend (ALBVE, pp. 398 and 645n24) and attended to trees in describing the island of Corsica ("Corsica"). B11. ["Pizarro the Universal Topic!"]. Monthly Magazine, 8 (August 1799): 514–516. Signed "A Lover of Variety." The writer complains that current conversation is monopolized by Sheridan's Pizarro, satirically exaggerates public monomania over the play, and hopes to return to discussing current events (the war, specifically General Suwarrow, an allusion to the invasion of Switzerland deplored by Barbauld and her family). This could be backhanded praise of the kind Barbauld gives to Roscoe's Lorenzo (A3). However, she was away from London during much of the run of the play. Pizarro opened at Drury Lane on 23 May and was repeated 31 times before 1 July (Ben Ross Schneider, Index to The London Stage, 1660–1800 [ Carbondale , IL, 1979]). B12. ["Origin of Nerves Inquired after."] Monthly Magazine, 9 (February 1800): 105–107. Signed "Neurologus" and dated "Feb. 10, 1800." A teasing treatment of the fashion for "nerves" among the genteel urban classes. The writer pretends to ask if nerves were imported from abroad (an allusion to German plays) or are of native growth or invention. In "Comparison of Manners" Barbauld notes that "it is as difficult to ascertain the origin of a new folly, as of a new invention" (p. 9). B13. ["Lunatics out of Hospitals."] Monthly Magazine, II (March 1801): 202205. Signed "Ol. Oldstile. Opposite Moorfields, March 1801." Proposes that compulsive gamblers, speculators, worldly preachers, and parents who spoil their children be considered madmen. The writer flirts with medical terminology and the jargon of the stock exchange, and quotes Isaiah 5:7–8 ("woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field"). The writer is "a spectator of men and things" and has intended for a year to write on this subject, but has lacked "leisure" to do it. The writer's attention to compulsive behavior could result from living with Rochemont (also Rochemont's Chancery suit involved speculation in real estate, or "joining house to house"); so could the distractions that kept the writer from writing. Against attribution: the name "Oliver Oldstyle" occurs as signature to a piece "On the Affectation of Inferiority" in the Sentimental Magazine (reprinted in The Spirit of the Public Journals for 1801 [ London , 1802], 288–294); and to a piece, "Ducking Chairs," published in The Oracle (reprinted ibid., 354–356); ALB is not known to have published in either periodical. Note on Barbauld's contributions to the Monthly Magazine . If one maps onto a list of the magazine's monthly issues Barbauld's known contributions in prose and verse in one column, and these conjectured contributions in an adjoining column, a definite or conjectural Barbauld piece appears in twenty-five of the forty-nine numbers between February 1796 (her "Cosmogunia" dialogue) and February 1800 ("On Prejudice"). Taken together with her reported intention to contribute to the new magazine (see above), the number suggests that she meant to send her brother something at least every other month. If the reasoning were not circular, this inference might be taken as further evidence in support of the conjectural attributions. B14. "Conversation Revived." Athenaeum, 2 (August 1807): 113–114. Signed "One of the BAS TON" and dated 11 June 1807. Pretends to report the re-appearance in fashion of conversation, personified as a returned exile who has been victimized by "Folly" and, earlier, "Fashion." Quotes Othello ("trifles light as air"), Paradise Lost ("faithful among the faithless found"), and Pope ("The feast of Reason, and the flow of soul"). In "Comparison of Manners" (A17), Barbauld criticized a new superciliousness among the rich that inhibited conversation (quoted in ALBVE, p. 422). B15. "What Constitutes Country." Athenaeum, 2 (August 1807): 128-130. Signed "A REMONSTRANT." Moved by a passage in Dutensiana (1806) about the persecution of Protestants in France , the writer reflects on the treatment of Dissenters in England . The writer likens England to "a partial step-mother," as Barbauld does in Address to the Opposers; and charges "the system of toleration " with insulting Dissenters, as Barbauld does in the second edition of her Address. A nation that "will not amend ... must expect to be taught wisdom by some very severe lesson" (cf. the closing paragraph of Barbauld's "What Is Education?"). Although these sentiments all run parallel with Barbauld's, they could be John Aikin's also; she, however, would be more likely than he to be conscious of French Protestants, having married a man of Huguenot ancestry. B16. "Remarks on Versification." Athenaeum, 2 (September 1807): 229–231 Signed "Candidus." Argues that the effects of versification are culturally relative and depend on the associations readers have formed with them. Defends anapestics, both in French and English, from the charge that they are ludicrous. Instances lines from Rowe, Montgomery's Ocean, and Beattie's Hermit. Barbauld argued for the power of association, most notably in the preface to Hymns in Prose, and she admired Montgomery's Ocean. However, Montgomery was a favorite with her brother and niece as well: John Aikin quoted Ocean in the Athenaeum in April 1807 (1:351). B17. "A Complainant." Athenaeum, 3 (June 1808): 537–538. Signed "The Public." "The Public" complains of "the petty injuries and vexations which I experience in the ordinary course of life," such as being relegated to the worst seats in theaters, having to stand through church services, and being barred from using country foot-paths. Quotes Coleridge's "Frost at Midnight," which Barbauld is believed to have reviewed in the Analytical in 1798. 40 40. 40. Analytical Review, 28 (Dec. 1798): 590–592, signed "D.M.S." and attributed by Derek Roper , Reviewing before the "Edinburgh," 1788–1802 ( Newark , DE, 1978), p. 283n76. B18. "A Topic of Consolation." Athenaeum, 4 (October 18ü8): 297–299. Signed "Mentor." Argues that the motto, Fortune "has taken away, but she first gave," suggests "matter of consolation under the loss of friends, or other deprivations." Addresses mainly the premature deaths of beloved children, but generalizes to "every blessing bestowed upon us by Providence ... with the purpose that we should make the best of it." Quotes Cymbeline, IV.ii.258–261, a passage perhaps alluded to in Barbauld's lines on Rochemont's death a month or more later ( PALB, p. 305). The argument for attributing this piece to Barbauld would be mainly biographical. In October 1808 she and Rochemont were living apart, separated apparently for good, and she was grieving intensely over her loss (see ALBVE, pp. 439–440); the essay would be an attempt to console herself. B19. "Maxims of Frugality Vindicated." Athenaeum, 5 (March 1809): 207208. Signed "Priscus." Takes issue with "a late publication" (not identified) in which the maxims of Poor Richard are censured; argues in defense of Poor Richard and of frugality as "the foundation of every thing honourable and manly in social and political life." Cites the spendthrift Harrell in Burney's Cecilia, a novel Barbauld admired and included in The British Novelists, on which she was working at this time. B20. "On the Necessity of preaching against Political Immoralities." Monthly Repository, 8 (June 1813): 379–383. Signed "A Lay Dissenter." The writer argues that Christian ministers are obliged by their allegiance to the Bible to denounce evils committed by government, and that the obligation is politically impartial. The chief example of the kind of evils to be denounced is the government's treatment of an unnamed "political writer" who censured the vices of "a personage of high rank and great influence in the state" (the Prince Regent) and was prosecuted for libel. The writer quotes a line from Cowper as epigraph and a passage from Guardian No. 80 on political use of the Church "for managing the loves and hatreds of mankind." Barbauld admired Cowper and included papers from the Guardian in her 1804 Addison-Steele collection, but not No. 80. THACKERAY'S ARTICLES IN THE MORNING CHRONICLE by Gary Simons During the early years of the Victorian era the major novelist-to-be, William Makepeace Thackeray , wrote over six hundred separately published articles encompassing a variety of literary styles and genres for over twenty different periodicals ( Harden , Checklist of Contributions). Much of Thackeray's periodical satiric fiction – particularly the pseudonymous stories and novels serialized in Fraser's Magazine from 1837 to 1847 (such as The Yellowplush Correspondence, Catherine, and Barry Lyndon ) and the satires published in Punch during the years 1842–54 (as exemplified by articles by "the fat contributor" or series such as The Snobs of England, or Punch's Prize Novelists ) – has received considerable scholarly attention (Pearson, W. M. Thackeray and the Mediated Text; Sanders , "Thackeray and Punch "). However, partially because of difficulties in attribution, the many anonymous critical articles Thackeray wrote during those same years for two of London's leading newspapers, The Times (1837–40) and The Morning Chronicle (ca.1838–48), have been relatively unnoticed. This lack of attention is regrettable, as Thackeray's newspaper articles often metamorphosed into revealing essays on the manners and life of the early Victorian world. These essays include: assessments of the world of art; reviews of the works of leading English and American authors and the literary trends of the day; ruminations on the aesthetics of poets and poetry; remarks on leading thinkers and politicians of the era; examinations of England's relationships with America , France , Ireland , and Russia ; sentiments regarding Evangelicalism and Catholicism; thoughts on the roles of commoners, aristocrats, and royalty, and on the essential nature of republics and totalitarian regimes; considerations regarding travel to and the cultures of countries of Europe , Africa , and Asia ; observations on medieval and modern history; and comments on commerce and colonialism. Further, embedded in these articles are many markers of Thackeray's development as a novelist and essayist. Unfortunately, Thackeray never collected and republished his Times or Morning Chronicle articles. Consequently, one of the most comprehensive editions of Thackeray's works, the 1908 Oxford Thackeray, includes only one article from the Morning Chronicle . 1 During the twentieth century Harold Gulliver (in his 1934 book Thackeray's Literary Apprenticeship) and Gordon Ray (as part of his 1945–46 The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray and his subsequent 1. See Johnson , 51–56; Thackeray , Oxford Thackeray 1:67–110, 3:383–396. A modern scholarly edition of Thackeray's works under the general editorship of Peter Shillingsburg has not yet included Thackeray's critical journalism. 1955 republication of some of these articles in William Makepeace Thackeray: Contributions to the Morning Chronicle ) brought to light some of Thackeray's work in this newspaper. Most of Gulliver's and Ray's attributions are based on uncertain internal evidence. There is, of course, an inherent tension between the need to avoid (or minimize) erroneous attributions and simultaneously to achieve as complete and representative a bibliography as possible. Diversity and range of attributions is important, as different articles may provide different insights into Victorian affairs and attitudes, Thackeray's perceptions and thinking, and his development as an author. Indeed, despite the lack of supporting external evidence, scholars and biographers – such as Robert Colby , Laura Fascik , Judith Fisher , Donald Hawes , Charles Mauskopf , John McAuliffe , Claire Nicolay , Lidmilla Pantückova , Richard Pearson , Catherine Peters , S. S. Prawer , and D. J. Taylor – have relied upon and drawn from Ray's over sixty-year-old Morning Chronicle list to support their respective analyses of Thackeray's life and work. 2 Accordingly, it seems appropriate to reconsider and update Thackeray's Morning Chronicle bibliography in the same manner as a previous paper updated Thackeray's 1837–40 enumerative bibliography for the Times. 3 This paper: (i) overviews Thackeray's contributory arrangements with the Morning Chronicle; (2) summarizes and assesses prior attributions; (3) and proposes additional attributions to flesh out an understanding of Thackeray's contributions to this periodical. Thackeray and the Morning Chronicle As Gordon Ray has noted, "During the eighteen-thirties and eighteen-forties the Morning Chronicle was the chief rival of the Times for the title of London's principal newspaper" (Ray, Contributions xi). Under the editorship of John Black in 1834 the Morning Chronicle had been revitalized and converted into a Whig organ to act as counterweight to the Toryish Times. By 1844 Black had been replaced by Andrew Doyle but the general policies of the newspaper remained the same. The paper supported the aggressive foreign policy advocated by Lord Palmerston and published the political-economic articles of John Stuart Mill . Although Mayhew's famous Morning Chronicle series on "London Labor and the London Poor" was only to appear later, during the years 1844–46 the paper was nonetheless generally branded as the "serious" competitor to the Times, as compared to less serious but more popular papers such as Dickens's Daily News (Bourne 2:87–95, 143, 168). In the spring of 1835 the twenty-three-year-old Thackeray, living in Paris and studying art, was a regular visitor to the household of Eyre Evans Crowe, the Paris correspondent of the Morning Chronicle (Crowe 10). In what appears to be his first effort to get full-time employment, Thackeray with Crowe's help applied 2. See Colby 45, 69, 129, 207, 243, 341; Fasick 82; Fischer 78; Hawes 64; Mauskopf 21–33; McAuliffe 25–40; Nicolay 119—145; Pearson 127, 130; Pantückova 79–105; Peters 250; Prawer 123, 180, 182–183, 214–216; Taylor 240, 256, 271; Thomas 2, 24, 31. 3. Simons , "Thackeray's Contributions to the Times." for (but did not receive) a foreign correspondent position at Constantinople for the Morning Chronicle (Ray, Letters 1:281, 283). Later, in March 1838, Thackeray spent time in Paris and with the Crowes. In an 1853 letter Thackeray wrote, "I recalled to Mr. Crowe as we walked back from the cemetery; how 15 years ago he use to pay me 10 francs a day to do his work as Newspaper Correspondent for him" (Harden, Letters Supp. 1:604). In a subsequent letter Thackeray again wrote "How welcome those 10 francs a day used to be when he was away &amp; I was doing his work for the Chronicle" (Harden, Letters Supp. 1:777). Thus, some of Crowe’s Morning Chronicle submissions in 1835 or 1838 were apparently written in whole or in part by Thackeray . Charles Mackay , a subeditor of the Morning Chronicle from 1835 to 1844, wrote in his memoirs that " Mr. Thackeray , from so early a period as 1839–1840, was a frequent contributor to his favourite journal, the Morning Chronicle, though he never succeeded in establishing a permanent connection with it" ( Mackay , Forty Years Recollection 2:294). In another memoir Mackay adds that " Thackeray was often a paid contributor to the Chronicle, especially on subjects related to the Fine Arts" ( Mackay , Memorials 1:58). If Mackay’s memory is correct, Thackeray was submitting contributions to the Morning Chronicle in his own name in the early 1840s (although any such submissions would have been published anonymously). A surviving letter from May 1839 documents the Chronicle’s rejection of a Thackeray submission in which Thackeray writes that he is "now only waiting to know what they want" (Ray, Letters 1:384). Thackeray’s Morning Chronicle articles from the early 1840s remain largely unidentified; however, as subsequently discussed, an April 1, 1842, art review in the Morning Chronicle is likely a Thackeray freelance contribution. On March 11, 1844, Thackeray wrote to his mother about a couple of potential posts, "one [of which] is at the Morning Chronicle where my friends Doyle &amp; Crowe are working anxiously in my favour" (Ray, Letters 2:164). Thackeray did reach some agreement with the Morning Chronicle; two articles by Thackeray totaling 3.05 columns were published in the Morning Chronicle in March 1844, and Thackeray's account book for March 1844 appropriately shows an entry of 8 pounds for the Chronicle, reflecting a rate of 2.5 guineas per column (Ray, Letters 2:841; Simons, Pecuniary Explication 37). As mentioned previously, Mackay stated that Thackeray never had a permanent (presumably a salaried staff) position with the Morning Chronicle, and that apparently is true; in early June 1844 Thackeray wrote that "The Chronicle is I believe as safe as if I had an engagement" (Ray, Letters 2:170; emphasis added). Later, in June 1844 Thackeray complained that he didn't "do above 20£ for the Chronicle instead of 40 – but it is my own fault – the fact is I can't write the politics and the literary part is badly paid" (Ray, Letters 2:172). Thackeray's newspaper work was interrupted during his trip from August 22, 1844, through February 8, 1845, around the Mediterranean, but he appears to have resumed his Morning Chronicle contributions in March 1845. During March – July 1845 Thackeray also held a time-consuming position as subeditor of the Examiner, and in the second half of 1845 he was absorbed with writing his travel book, Notes of A Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo, conflicting responsibilities which perhaps explain his generally low level of Morning Chronicle activity for most of that year. Previous Thackeray scholars have not identified any Thackeray articles from the periodJune-November 1845; however, a Thackeray letter dated November 28, 1845, in which Thackeray asserted that "The Chronicle articles are very well liked – they relieve the dullness of that estimable paper," makes it clear that Thackeray articles continued to be published (Ray, Letters 2:216). In a letter tentatively dated January, 1846, Thackeray returned to the issue of political articles when he wrote "I have besides 700 £ between Punch &amp; the Chronicle: though I don't count on the latter beyond the year as I am a very weak &amp; poor politician only good for outside articles and occasional jeux d'esprit" (Ray, Letters 2:225). Indeed, in February 1846 Thackeray wrote that he was "making a failure at the Chronicle[;] all my articles miss fire: except the literary ones" (Ray, Letters 2:229). And in March 1846 Thackeray wrote "The Chronicle and I must part or I must cut down half the salary. They are most provokingly friendly all the time, and insist that I should neither resign nor disgorge — but how can one but act honorably by people who are so good natured?" (Ray, Letters 2:231). "Disgorge" implies giving money back or reducing income. All this suggests that the Morning Chronicle may have been paying Thackeray for "misfired" political articles and that because his political articles were unacceptable Thackeray believed his income should be reduced. Under this interpretation several questions remain open: which political articles did Thackeray write for the Morning Chronicle, were they published, what opinions did he express, and why were those articles deemed to be failures? In February 1846 Thackeray temporarily resigned from the Chronicle; however, he soon rescinded this decision and wrote articles from March through at least October 1846. In January 1847, coincident with the initial serialization of Vanity Fair, Thackeray wrote to Caroline Norton that: "I am no longer a writer in the Chronicle" (Ray, Letters 2:264). But this was not a final decision. In April 1848, Thackeray , despite the money he was then earning from Vanity Fair, wrote to his mother complaining: "My own expenses are something very severe – and with debts keep me always paying &amp; poor." To find this extra income, Thackeray added that he was "writing a little for the Chronicle and getting good pay always thinking, plunging about, thinking as usual" (Ray, Letters 2:373). Indeed, Thackeray's letters from April, October, and November 1848 establish that, motivated by "an awful bribe that five guineas an article," he continued to write for the Morning Chronicle (Ray, Letters 2:362, 373, 442, 459). However, as his income from his novels grew, there is no indication that he wrote critical articles for that newspaper after 1848. Previous Attributions By the start of the twentieth century only one signed letter and one critical review in the Morning Chronicle – a review of R. H. Horne's New Spirit of the Age – had been positively attributed to Thackeray . In 1934 Harold Gulliver pointed out one other certain attribution ("The Poetical Works of Horace Smith ") and, largely on stylistic grounds, attributed a handful of other book reviews: a Beau Brummell biography; Disraeli's Coningsby; a biography of Lord Chancellor Eldon; and literary reviews entitled "The Discipline of Life" and "Early Travels in Palestine." In 1942 C. L. Cline found a letter externally supporting Gulliver's attribution of the Coningsby review to Thackeray . In 1945-46 Gordon Ray, in the course of collecting and editing Thackeray's letters and private papers, developed and published his own attribution list of thirty-five Morning Chronicle articles purportedly written by Thackeray during the years 1844– 1846 and 1848 (Ray, Letters 2:845–846). Ray accepted Gulliver's Beau Brummell and Conningsby attributions but rejected without comment Gulliver's other suggestions. Approximately ten years later Ray reprinted those same thirty-five articles, along with introductory comments and notes, in his volume William Makepeace Thackeray : Contributions to the Morning Chronicle. Ray's attributions have been generally accepted by Thackeray scholars. The articles on Ray's list are included in toto in Edgar Harden's authoritative 1996 Checklist bibliography of Thackeray's periodical contributions. Even including Thackeray letters that have come to light since the 1950s, only eight of Ray's thirty-five proposed Thackeray Morning Chronicle attributions are now validated by external evidence: the April 2, 1844, review of Horne's New Spirit of the Age; the May 13, 1844, review of Disraeli's Coningsby; the May 13, 1845, review of Disraeli's Sybil; a March 21, 1846, review of the Life and Correspondence of David Hume ; an August 20, 1846, review of Moore's History of Ireland ; a September 21, 1846, review of Horace Smith's Poetical Works; and two short reports on the Chartist movement from March 1848. Two other attributions – the March 16, 1844, review of Venedey's Ireland and the August 2, 1844, review of George Smythe's Historic Fancies– are less firmly supported by references in Thackeray's diary and letters that establish he was reading the works in question shortly prior to the published review. Additionally, an indirect cross-reference in Thackeray's review of Disraeli's Sybil strongly suggests that Thackeray also wrote the April 3, 1845, review of Lever's St. Patrick's Eve. Lastly, a consistent Thackeray critique against "sentimental works ... investigating questions of greater social or political interest" gives considerable weight to the argument that the "Christmas Books" reviews of December 24, 26, and 31, 1845, are also by Thackeray . Thus, fourteen of Ray's Thackeray Morning Chronicle attributions have explicitly argued and reasonably firm support. As to the remaining twenty-one Thackeray attributions, Ray argues that "the echoes of Thackeray's acknowledged writings are so numerous, the parallels to his familiar opinions so obvious, and his stylistic peculiarities so manifest, that no doubt as to the authorship of these articles remains, even without specific evidence" (Ray, Contributions xii-xiii). In support of this argument, but without providing any rationales or explanations, Ray lists in a footnote some of the places in Thackeray's works where he finds relevant "echoes" or "parallels"; these references support some of the fourteen previously mentioned articles as well as ten additional articles. The attribution of the remaining eleven articles is asserted without any supporting citations or commentary (see table 1). In light of the uncertainty generally and properly associated with attributions based on purely internal evidence, one needs to remember the tenuous nature of most of Ray's attributions. Attribution Analyses This current examination validates Ray as a careful and knowledgeable evaluator of potential Thackeray articles. Although Ray did not provide any specifics regarding eleven of his attributions, the appropriate "echoes, parallels, and peculiarities" do exist. The 1844 and 1846 Morning Chronicle reviews of Water Color exhibitions and the 1846 review of Benjamin Haydon's Lectures on Painting and Design display Thackeray's characteristic humor, writing style, and artistic opinions. The March 1844 review of Ireland and its Rulers, since 1829 ties nicely with a Morning Chronicle reference in Thackeray's March 1844 financial records, and the opinions expressed in an April 1844 review of a travel book by D'Arlincourt are representative of Thackeray's other writings on the French and the Irish. The March 1845 review of Egypt under Mehemet Ali contains a subtle reference to Thackeray's own 1844 exploits in Egypt, and the references to "Gil Blas," "Hajji Baba," "Falstaff," and " S. Panza " in the 1846 review of Travels in the Punjab all have a Thackerayan flavor. The July 1846 review of The Gastronomic Regenerator reflects Thackeray's long-term friendship with Alexis Soyer , and the September 1846 review of Life at the Water Cure contains tell-tale pet phrases of Thackeray . Of all of Ray's attributions perhaps the late 1846 reviews of a volume of the memoirs of Madame d'Arblay (Fanny Burney) and of a brochure entitled Royal Palaces have the least overt support, but even in these cases the expressive language and opinions seem to be Thackeray's. In fact, a case can also be built for the probable attribution of one of the articles suggested by Gulliver but not included by Ray – the July 15 and 25, 1844, two-part review of Twiss's biography of a former British Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon. In addition to stylistic and point-of-view arguments, Gulliver supported his attribution by referring to a comment on this biography in Thackeray's Four Georges lectures. Indeed, Edgar Harden has since shown that in the mid–1850s Thackeray consulted this biography in preparation of his lecture on George IV ( Harden , English Humourists 213, 266). However, there are more contemporaneous references to Twiss and/or Eldon in Thackeray's writings – as in the December 26, 1846, publication in Punch of chapter 43 of the Snobs of England , the May 1847 number of Vanity Fair, and the April 1849 number of Pendennis – which demonstrate Thackeray's intimate acquaintance with this biography ( Thackeray , The Oxford Thackeray 9:444–445; 11:189; 12:367). Further, as shown elsewhere, Thackeray depended on the Morning Chronicle for roughly one-third of his income in May and June 1844, and the attribution of these reviews to Thackeray is consistent with the reasonable expectation that he would have continued to write for this needed revenue in July (Simons, Pecuniary Explication 117–118). Attributions based solely on arguments of "style" are by their very nature suspect; however, I submit that attributions can reasonably be made on a broader basis of content, circumstances, and sometimes even cash payment records. Indeed, through a page-by-page examination of a file of the 1840s Morning Chronicle, encompassing over 400 previously unattributed literary and artistic reviews, I have identified a number of articles not previously mentioned by Ray which more than meet Ray's "echoes, parallels, and peculiarities" test. In two cases external financial data support the attribution; in other cases circumstantial evidence increases the likelihood of Thackeray's authorship. Accordingly, I offer ten new attributions, which collectively place more meat on the bones of the skeletal framework of Thackeray's Morning Chronicle writings. In his review of Ray's Thackeray's Contributions to the Morning Chronicle Robert Metzdorf, although concurring with Ray's verdicts, gently chided Ray for not providing the specifics of the detailed supporting arguments for his "somewhat tenuous attributions" (335–337). Accordingly, the following subsections provide individual, specific, and fully articulated rationales whose persuasiveness can be evaluated. "The Exhibition of the Louvre," April 1, 1842 . Thackeray was in Paris in the spring of 1842; and the article published in the April 1, 1842, Morning Chronicle entitled "The Exhibition of the Louvre," dated March 18 and designated as "From a Correspondent," appears to be his. According to Charles Mackay , Thackeray was a free-lance contributor of fine arts articles for the Chronicle during the early 1840s. More specifically, Thackeray attended opening day (March 15) at the 1842 Salon, 4 and it would have been unlike him not to seek to profit from that exhibition by publishing a review. And the 1842 Morning Chronicle review of the exhibition at the Louvre bears striking similarities to Thackeray's 1838 Times review of the Salon. Unlike essentially all the non- Thackeray contemporary newspaper art reviews, both of these reviews are overtly humorous. Further, both articles have similar extended and personal introductions; both joke about the large number of poor-quality works exhibited; both satirize the alleged vanity of French artists; both epigrammatically attack artistic pomposity; both regard French portraits and landscapes as inferior to their English counterparts; both single out for praise the artists Biard and Winterhalter; and both are full of archetypically Thackerayan gentle mockery. Finally, this Salon review, coincident with Thackeray's last March visit to Paris of the decade, is the only independent review (not reprinted from another paper) which the Morning Chronicle published on the Salon during the entire first decade of the Victorian era. "Exhibition of the Royal Academy," May 8 and 10, 1844. The attribution of the two Morning Chronicle art exhibition reviews published on May 8 and 10, 1844, is supported both by financial information in Thackeray's letters as well as by a detailed comparison of these articles with a Thackeray review of the same exhibition published in the June 1844 issue of Fraser's Magazine. The financial argument is straightforward. I have noted previously that Thackeray received 2.5 guineas per column for his work for the Morning Chronicle. In a letter dated June 1, 1844, Thackeray noted that he didn't "do above 20£" a month for the Chronicle; however, previous scholarship had attributed only two May 1844 articles to Thackeray which together total 4.8 columns and are thus valued at twelve and a half pounds. There are a limited number of candidates which might reasonably support Thackeray's comment, first of which is the 2.75 columns of previously unattributed May 8 and May 10 art reviews in the Morning Chronicle – articles which would bring the value of Thackeray's May Morning Chronicle writings to nearly 20 pounds, in line with his June 1 observation. 4. In a letter dated March 15, 1842, Thackeray wrote "I met a friend just now in the Louvre...." See Harden, Letters Supp. 1:118. Stimulated by this financial fit, I have elsewhere reported a detailed comparison of the Morning Chronicle reviews with Thackeray's June 1844 Fraser's Magazine article "May Gambols; or, Titmarsh in the Picture Galleries" (Simons, "'Show Me the Money'" 94–95) which is repeated here for completeness. There is an extraordinary degree of agreement with regard not only to opinion, but also to specific wordings. For example, Edwin Landseer's Coming Events cast their Shadows before is discussed in both reviews: in Fraser's Thackeray claims that the picture "perfectly chills the spectator," in the Morning Chronicle the reviewer exclaims that "your teeth begin to chatter as you look at the picture." Regarding the same painter's Shoeing, Fraser's notes that "the blacksmith only becomes impalpable"; the Morning Chronicle suggests that "the man's figure ... is somewhat unsubstantial." With regard to Turner's Rain, Speed, Steam, the Morning Chronicle columnist exclaims that the picture "actually succeeds in placing a railroad engine and train before you which are bearing down at the spectator at the rate of fifty miles an hour" and further praises the picture's "wonderful effects." In Fraser's Magazine Thackeray rhapsodizes that "there comes a train down upon you, really moving at the rate of fifty miles an hour," and adds that the means of the picture are "not less wonderful than the effects are." Fraser's Magazine praises Elmore's Rienzi addressing the People as "one of the very best pictures in the gallery"; the Morning Chronicle asserts that that picture "strikes us as being one of the best pictures in the exhibition." Fraser's argues that the subject of Poole's Moors beleaguered in Valencia is "worse than last year, when the artist only painted the plague of London "; the Morning Chronicle asserts that the subject of this work is "even more horrible than its predecessor." With regard to Herbert's Trial of the Seven Bishops, the Morning Chronicle reviewer declares that "the artist has not had fair play," while Fraser's Magazine asserts that "Painters have not fair-play in these parade pictures." A number of other similar points of comparison testify to the common authorship of the Morning Chronicle and Fraser's Magazine reviews. Yet, it should also be noted that each review also contains ideas and expressive wording that are not in its counterpart; thus, the attribution of these Morning Chronicle reviews to Thackeray meaningfully extends our knowledge of both his journalistic endeavors and his artistic criticism. "Ellen Middleton. A Tale. By Lady Georgiana Fullerton," June 20, 1844. Thackeray often philosophized in his Morning Chronicle reviews regarding the importance of realistic writing and the proper attributes of novels. Accordingly, some introductory comments in the June 20, 1844, Morning Chronicle review of the novel Ellen Middleton are of particular interest: We are promised at the commencement an every-day picture of life, and the artist is true to her purpose, and to an evident horror of pretence – avoids every digression, eschews sentiment, unless it comes naturally in the current of the story, shrinks even from exuberance of description, and indulges in no exaggeration of character. There is nothing to attract the reader of falsified taste, no limnings of high life or eminent persons, no piquant anecdotes, no personal satire – so untainted is it with the follies and peculiarities of our day, that it might have been written an hundred years back by Fielding, if he could have divested himself of his coarseness, or by Goldsmith in his simplest vein. This is so distinctively Thackeray's literary credo – including his well-documented praise for pictures of everyday life, horror of pretence, aversion to oversentimentality, disdain for exuberance of description and exaggeration of character, distaste for fashionable "high life," regard for Fielding mixed with concern for his coarseness, and admiration for Goldsmith – that it strongly suggests that Thackeray wrote that review. Those who are familiar with Thackeray's work might look askance on the comments critiquing "digression" and "personal satire," but digression was only to assert its sway in Thackeray's writings in later years, and as for "personal satire," Thackeray – perhaps with self-induced amnesia regarding the very personal attacks he had made on Bulwer – considered himself a social satirist, not a personal satirist. In an 1848 letter to Edward Chapman, Thackeray decried "a literary war in which a man descends to describing odious personal peculiarities in his rival" and added "Make fun of my books, my style, my public works – but of me a gentleman – O for shame" (Ray, Letters 2:456). Other evidence also suggests that Thackeray is the author of this review. The reviewer writes: [T]here is a novel of our day which "Ellen Middleton" resembles still more [than " Caleb Williams "], although the resemblance be not such as to render imitation possible. This is the "Mathilde" of Mr. Eugene Sue , a story ... portrayed with a minuteness and warmth which binds us through ever so many volumes to the heroine's fate. "Ellen Middleton" is "Mathilde" without the melodrama, without exaggeration. ... But it has the same sustained tone of passion, the same depth of interest throughout. This comment is particularly relevant because when Thackeray read Mathilde in 1841 his first thought was likewise about the possibility of imitation (Ray, Letters 2:32). Moreover, a review of Mathilde in the July 1842 issue of Foreign Quarterly Review which is probably by Thackeray offers similar sentiments to describe that novel, referring to Mathilde's "unnaturalness," "exaggeration," and simultaneous high level of sustained "interest" and "foundation of truth and spirit." Lastly, one finds the Morning Chronicle reviewer's high praise for the author of Ellen Middleton, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, echoed in Thackeray's letters (Harden, Letters Supp. 1:583). "Spain, Tangier, &amp;c., visited in 1840 and 1841. By X. Y. Z," June 26, 1845. This review of a travel book is most likely by Thackeray . One might suspect that Thackeray is the author based on the reviewer's (1) repeatedly echoing Thackeray's well-known aesthetics, as in his praise that "the charm of this work is the absence of all pretence" and in its true-to-life portrayals; or (2) use of artistic terms of comparison, as frequently employed by Thackeray , i.e., the author "moralizes like a Hogarth upon scenes that are as finished as the best of Wilkie's"; or (3) ability to turn an ironic phrase, as in the reference to "that cheerless chamber in which Mr. Barry has, with a truly democratic spirit, doomed the Lords, for their sins, to sit." However, the strongest arguments for Thackeray's authorship of this review lie in two points of content which connect Catholic Spain with Thackeray's particular concerns regarding Catholic Ireland . Thackeray had written earlier that spring, in an article published June 9, 1845, in the Calcutta Star, that if England respected and supported the Irish Catholic church (through the Maynooth grant) then Ireland would become "the loyal kingdom of the three, rallying round the old fashioned Monarchy, the old fashioned laws, the old fashioned Conservative Catholic religion" (Summerfield 222). It is, accordingly, striking that the Morning Chronicle reviewer seizes upon precisely the same argument and quotes a lengthy like-minded extract from the book because it "is so applicable to the discussions on the Maynooth grant." Moreover, the reviewer goes on to stress the similarity between the book's comments on "The Madrid Idlers" and the Irish "incessant loungers" in Dublin and Kingston; Thackeray had discussed at length the idle "shabby sauntering people" between Kingston and Dublin in the opening pages of his Irish Sketch Book ( Thackeray , Oxford Thackeray 5:5–9). Thus, style and content both suggest that Thackeray is the likely author. "Exhibition of the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street," March 30, 1846. In 1945, in an appendix to volume 2 of The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray , Gordon Ray announced the attribution to Thackeray of Morning Chronicle reviews of the 1846 exhibitions of the Old and New Water Colour Societies and of the Royal Academy. Indeed, it is surprising that Ray did not also attribute to Thackeray the review of the exhibition of the Society of British Artists (SBA) which was published on March 30, 1846. Presumably this omission was inadvertent, since the SBA review includes evidence of Thackeray's touch, echoes his previously stated opinions, and demonstrates his particular style in the same fashion and to the same degree as do the exhibition reviews included by Ray. The SBA review begins with an extended humorous complaint regarding exhibition crowding: the reviewer blithely notes he had to "thread a street full of countless chariots, and at the gates, to penetrate through a regiment of flunkies" and still had to "inspect a masterpiece through the tails of a gentleman's coat." Structurally, thematically, and stylistically, this introduction is vintage Thackeray . Moreover, in typical Thackeray fashion this review contains an oblique satirical comment about Benjamin Haydon, dryly acclaims "a laudable scarcity" of portraits, introduces "the veterinary college of art" as "that most popular branch of the profession," and with regard to historical pictures in deadpan fashion asserts that "The dead body of Harold is discovered in two places." I submit that this through-and-through marbling of serious art review with strands of humor is uniquely Thackerayan. Moreover, in conformity with Thackeray's previously demonstrated artistic views, this reviewer, (1) although he simultaneously criticizes "the unfortunate dirtiness of his palette," gives Frederic Hurlstone pride of place as the lead SBA exhibitor; (2) notes the arresting colors of Alfred Woolmer; and (3) praises the heads drawn by Charles Baxter . Lastly, one should note that this March 30 review fits a pattern of essentially weekly Morning Chronicle contributions by Thackeray in the early spring of 1846 (known Thackeray articles were published on March 16, March 23, April 6, April 11, April 21, and April 27) and that it is expected that the reviewer of the Water Colour and Royal Academy exhibitions would also review the Society of British Artists exhibition. "Londres et les Anglais des Temps Modernes. Par Dr. Buraud-Riofrey ," July 24, 1846. Thackeray often mused about the inability of the French to understand the English. In his Punch essay "On an Interesting French Exile" ( Thackeray , Oxford Thackeray 8:367–371), for example, Thackeray talks about those foreigners "who live but four hours' distance from us [the French]" visit London with but a poor understanding of the English language, and misunderstand everything they see. Thackeray's particular complaint focuses on French writers who misrepresent England . A French journalist, Ledru Rollin, wrote what Thackeray considered to be "an odious picture" of England based on hearsay: "I doubt whether the Frenchman has ever seen at all the dear old country of ours, which he reviles and curses, and abuses." According to Thackeray even G. W. M. Reynolds, author of The Mysteries of London , a penny dreadful that misrepresents English life, gave no information to Rollin. An 1849 Punch essay entitled "Two or Three Theatres at Paris " ( Thackeray , Oxford Thackeray 8:472-476) satirically plays upon the same theme using a similar example: "I have been to see a piece of a piece called the Mystères de Londres [presumably the play by Féval, not the serial by Reynolds] and most awful mysteries they are indeed. We little know what is going on around and below us, and that London may be enveloped in a vast murderous conspiracy. ..." This same theme of French failure to understand the English also runs through several of Thackeray's 1843 Foreign Quarterly Review essays. In an 1846 Morning Chronicle review of Londres et les Anglais des Temps Modernes which contains a number of suggestive stylistic markers of Thackeray's authorship, one finds the same discussion in almost the same language: Is it conceivable that when Paris and London are scarcely removed one day's journey from each other, that such a work as the "Mysteres de Londres" shall have obtained vogue among our neighbours as a fair representation of English life? Is it the custom of young lords to disguise themselves as policemen, for the purpose of carrying on their sentimental intrigues? Do Englishmen divide their lives between boxing and getting drunk? We give this as but one example, probably a striking one, of the misapprehension under which our neighbours lie as to Englishmen and their modes of life; but we have no hesitation in saying that such trash as this, sometimes a little better and sometimes a little worse, is the manner in which Englishmen are represented in the imaginative literature of France. Incidentally, Thackeray argues in his review that Buraud-Riofrey is an exception to the general rule and is an accurate French reporter of English life; nevertheless, this review apparently provided Thackeray with an opportunity to give voice to one of his hobby horses. "A Pilgrimage to the Temples and Tombs of Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine, in 1845–6. By Mrs. Romer ," September 4, 1846. This critical review is Thackeray -like in its expressive diction, ironic reflections on Mrs. Romer's exaggerations, expressed weariness with obsolete romantic styles, and privileging of the human and quotidian as opposed to the exotic. The reviewer's curiosity regarding forbidden and unseen (by men) "hareems" mirrors Thackeray's comments in Notes on a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo, as do the reviewer's comments on Abou Gosh and the one-eyed sheikh. Further, the reviewer's comment that "Once a man has seen the Pyramids, or the Great Horn, and the last account of these always becomes welcome ...," while it does not have to have been written by an Eastern traveler, certainly reads like the observation of one who has been to these places, as Thackeray himself had been in 1844. The most persuasive circumstantial evidence for Thackeray's authorship, however, comes from one of the reviewer's side comments. Thackeray often used names in his writings to represent special qualities. In particular, Thackeray took from Byron the names Zuleikah (or Zuleika) and Medora as representing exotic women of the East, but typically with ironic implications. 5 Thus, when the Morning Chronicle reviewer punctures the romance of the East with the comments that "Zuleikah is a fat matron, with corked eyebrows, who has been transferred from the Pasha to the Bey; Medora consoles herself in her lord's absence with she-buffons and inharmonious singers," I submit that there is a strong probability that Thackeray is the reviewer. "Heidelberg. A Romance. By G. P. R. James , Esq.," September 23, 1846 . From April through October 1847, under the running title "Punch's Prize Novelists," Thackeray published a series of mini-novel spoofs of the styles of several leading novelists. This series was later republished in collected form as Novels by Eminent Hands. In addition to satirizing his own writing ("Je-mes Pl-sh, Esq."), Thackeray mimicked and exaggerated the peculiarities of Edward Bulwer-Lytton ( "George de Barnwell" ), James Fenimore Cooper ("The Stars and Stripes"), Benjamin Disraeli ("Codlingsby"), Catherine Gore ("Lords and Liveries"), Charles Lever ("Phil. Fogarty"), and George Payne Rainsford James ("Barbazure"). In the introduction to his critical edition of "Punch's Prize Novelists" Edgar Harden has noted that this series had "clear origins in book reviews that he [ Thackeray ] was writing for The Morning Chronicle in 1844–1846" ("Historical Introduction" 73). Specifically: the Bulwer spoof " George de Barnwell " can be loosely paired with Thackeray's April 21, 1846, review of Bulwer's New Timon; "Stars and Stripes" mocks those aspects of Cooper's writing which Thackeray called out in his review of Cooper's Ravensnest on August 27, 1846; "Codlingsby" is a take-off on Disraeli's Coningsby which Thackeray reviewed on May 13, 1844; "Lords and Liveries" has the "careless, out-speaking, coarse, sarcastic" authorial voice that Thackeray critiqued in Gore's Sketches of English Character on May 4, 1846; and "Phil. Fogarty" displays the positive and negative attributes of Lever's writing which Thackeray noted in his April 3, 1845, review of Lever's St. Patrick's Eve. This parallelism suggests that there may well also be an as yet unattributed Thackeray Morning Chronicle review of the romance novelist G. P. R. James to serve as a prequel and source document for "Barbazure." Indeed, there is a September 23, 1846, Morning Chronicle review of James's Heidelberg. A Romance that perfectly fits that bill. This review runs in virtual lockstep with 5. See the 1839 Fraser's Magazine article "Our Annual Execution" (Oxford Thackeray 2:37:), the 1840 Paris Sketch Book (Oxford Thackeray 2:170), the 1846 From Cornhill to Grand Cairo (Oxford Thackeray 9:246), the 1847 Punch article "Love Songs of the Fat Contributor" (Oxford Thackeray 7:113), the 1847–1848 Vanity Fair (Oxford Thackeray 11:645), the 1848 Our Street (Oxford Thackeray 10:125); the 1848–49 Pendennis (Oxford Thackeray 12:30, 666); the 1851 Keepsake article entitled "Voltigeur" (Oxford Thackeray 10:594), and the 1851 Punch article An Ingleez Family (Oxford Thackeray 8:548). "Barbazure"; both begin by commenting on two cavaliers on horseback, both emphasize the melodramatic nature of the narrative and the overly romantic description of the countryside, and so on. Indeed, even if there had never been a "Barbazure," the Morning Chronicle review's joking style which mocks romance and at the same time displays an underlying affection for the work is distinctly Thackerayan; with Thackeray's established pattern of basing his literary spoofs on his prior reviews there can be little doubt that Thackeray is the author of this review. "Exhibition of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, Pall- Mall," April 17, 1848. On April 14, 1848, Thackeray wrote in a letter to his mother that "I am writing a little for the Chronicle and getting good pay always thinking, plunging about, thinking as usual" (Ray, Letters 2:373). Nevertheless, through the first half of that month there was little that could reasonably be associated with Thackeray . On April 17, however, an art review entitled "Exhibition of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, Pall-Mall" was published which circumstantial evidence suggests is likely by Thackeray . In overall approach and format the article is very similar to a Thackeray article "The Exhibitions of the Societies of Water Colour Painters," which was published in the Morning Chronicle in 1846, and is unlike 1843 and 1845 Morning Chronicle exhibition reviews by other writers which are mere assemblages of ratings with little explanation. As Thackeray normally did, this reviewer begins with an extended joke – in this case referring to "a ferocious encounter conducted with the fierce pugilistic competition which distinguishes Englishmen" as having occurred at an overcrowded entry point. Artistically, there are points of equivalency in the analyses of several artists discussed in the 1848 and 1846 reviews. Thus, the 1848 review speaks of Mr. Wehnert's works as having extraordinary power and being painted with "excellent care" and adds "We remember to have seen no watercolour drawing more vigorous"; in 1846 Thackeray refers to works by that same artist as "quivering with an agony frightful to witness" and expresses no doubt as to "the power, vigour, and careful execution of the painter." Similarly, in 1846 Thackeray criticized figures drawn by Mr. Riviere ; the 1848 reviewer critiques Mr. Riviere's figures for their "ugliness of countenance." Female figures by Miss Egerton are praised in both reviews. Mr. Absalon and Miss Setchel , water colorists whom Thackeray had praised as early as 1842 ([ Thackeray ], "An Exhibition Gossip"), receive strong praise again in the 1848 review. As a further indicator, the 1848 reviewer identifies himself as an "Eastern traveler"; he testifies to recalling similar images to those shown in a painting of Egypt and further notes that "everything is correct except the sky," which he argues has a wrong tone. Thackeray , of course, had visited Cairo in 1844, and would be one of a limited number of art critics of the era able to judge the verisimilitude of Egyptian scenes and the color of the Egyptian sky. Other possible Thackeray reviews in the Morning Chronicle. A number of other literary reviews "sound like" Thackeray but evidence is lacking to claim attribution. Interested readers might want to examine some or all of these articles to enjoy their expressiveness, language, and sometimes humor; explore their social contents and subtexts; or make their own assessments as to authorship and significance. Some candidates are: "The Prize Comedy, the Committee, and the Candidates," June 17, 1844. This tongue-in-cheek review by a "quiet and easy observer" of a Punch brochure appears to be an "inside job" – and Thackeray , was, of course, the only common denominator between Punch and the Morning Chronicle. Moreover, this article's extended exaggeration of Bulwer's initials is found in several of Thackeray's literary reviews. "King Alfred: a Poem," June 20, 1844. This review of a "Monster Epic Poem" of forty-eight books begins: "Monsters have been ere now. Men, it has been said or sung, have made monsters for and of themselves. There have been (it is whispered) women, also, who have made monsters of men. We have had monster meetings, monster speeches, monster trials, and monster traversers." I suggest this comment reflects Thackeray's sense of humor and his free-wheeling review style. "The Story of a Feather,"July 1, 1844. This review of a Douglas Jerrold story both eloquently praises Jerrold's insight and benevolence and gently chides him for "making all the lords selfish and all the bishops luxurious." This accurately reflects Thackeray's attitude toward Jerrold and is similar in approach to known Thackeray reviews of Jerrold's work. "Thiers' History. Histoire du Consulat, par A. Thiers," March 22, 1845. Thackeray was something of an expert on recent French history and he sought to review works of this kind. The attitudes expressed toward Thiers and French political figures reflect Thackeray's known opinions, and the style of the review is consistent with Thackeray's writings on similar subjects. "Faucher upon England . Etudes sur l'Angleterre. Par Leon Faucher," November 24, 1845. This is an entertainingly written and thoughtful commentary on a Thackeray interest area, the French view of England . On November 28, 1845, Thackeray wrote in a letter: "The Chronicle articles are very well liked – they relieve the dullness of that estimable paper" (Ray, Letters 2:216) – this might well be the article Thackeray had in mind. "Poems by Thomas Hood ," January 13, 1846. This Morning Chronicle review praises Hood in Thackeray -like language and describes the Thackeray favorite "Bridge of Sighs" as "the most meek and touching of wails." A comparison with Thackeray's subsequent 1860 Roundabout Paper in Cornhill on Hood (Oxford Thackeray 17:460–472) reveals similarities which suggest common authorship. "Second Love, and Other Tales, from the Note-book of a Traveller," September 3, 1846. The reviewer gently lectures the author on ways to improve his writing by making his plots more probable. The reviewer's suggestion that the author adopt "a vow to eschew gipsies for the term of his natural life" and the reviewer's satiric take on second loves both suggest Thackeray's sense of humor and literary style. "Hochelaga; or England in the New World," September 8, 1846. This review, written during a period when Thackeray was writing a great deal for the Morning Chronicle, has several Thackeray earmarks: expressive language, humor, well-turned phrases, a love of travel, and a particular appreciation for Eliot Warburton, the book's editor and well-known Eastern travel writer. "Lionel Deerhurst: or, Fashionable Life under the Regency. Edited by the Countess of Blessington," October 8, 1846. Although Thackeray attacked most silver-fork novels, he never attacked the Countess of Blessington's novels. The Morning Chronicle reviewer adroitly avoids assigning the Countess any responsibility for this bad novel in a manner consistent with Thackeray's cleverness as a writer and reflective of their close personal relationship. "Early Travels in Palestine," October 12, 1848. This joyous satiric commentary on the fantastic travel writings of Sir John Maundeville appeared to Harold Gulliver as a likely referent for Thackeray's October 18, 1848, claim that "he had begun to blaze away in the Chronicle again" (Ray, Letters 2:442; Gulliver, Apprenticeship 144–145, 242–243). I agree. A Thackeray Morning Chronicle Bibliography The table at the end of this paper lists Thackeray's attributed contributions to the Morning Chronicle. Without doubt the forty-eight listed entries still understate Thackeray's total contribution. Moreover, although Gordon Ray argued that possible future additions to his somewhat smaller subset of thirty-five republished contributions "should not materially alter the estimate of his work for the Chronicle' (Ray, Contributions xiii), I respectfully disagree. As detailed previously, it is possible that Thackeray was paid for unidentified political articles. Moreover, it is also likely that Thackeray's art reviews, and perhaps his comments on novels, are more distinctive, with more expression and more potential cross-references and authorship clues, than his reviews of biographies, histories, or travel writings. Thus, the currently attributed Morning Chronicle writings may not be fully representative of his contributions. Nevertheless, the articles that have been identified as Thackeray's do add substantially to our understanding of his ideas and his times. Most of Thackeray's anonymous art criticism was published in the Morning Chronicle, and these articles document his views. As Gordon Ray observed, Thackeray's Morning Chronicle literary reviews establish, perhaps better than do any of his other writings, his aesthetics and philosophy with regard to fiction. Looking outside the domestic sphere, no fewer than six of Thackeray's Morning Chronicle articles address the tangled relationship of England with Ireland , and another four comment on English views of the mysterious (or, as Thackeray claimed, no longer so mysterious) Eastern world. Further, Thackeray's varied comments on people and current events offer the empathetic perspective that one would expect from the author of English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century and The Four Georges and consequently shed light on the "manners and morals" of the early Victorian era. Thackeray's writings for the Morning Chronicle were tightly clustered. There were extended periods of time in which Thackeray wrote articles on essentially a weekly basis: namely, from mid-March through July 1844, the spring of 1846, and especially from mid-August into October 1846. Even the "candidate" articles identified in this paper tend to be associated with those time periods. However, there are long periods where simply nothing that clearly carries Thackeray's touch was published in the Morning Chronicle. The general rule that whenever Thackeray was out of England he stopped his newspaper writing explains the gap from mid-August 1844 to mid-March 1845. The reason for Thackeray's failure to write for the Morning Chronicle in the second half of 1845 is less clear. Further, although comments in Thackeray’s letters clearly establish that he was writing for the Morning Chronicle in 1848, few 1848 articles can unambiguously be attributed to him; perhaps, as he was absorbed in the writing of Vanity Fair and Pendennis and heavily committed at Punch, his later Morning Chronicle reviews suffered and became less distinctive. Thackeray’s Morning Chronicle articles, taken as a whole, offer a multidimensional view of the early Victorian world, and provide a significant gateway into Thackeray’s thinking and artistic development. They deserve to be read, analyzed, and appreciated as part of the Thackeray canon. Table 1.

WILKIE COLLINS IN SMITH , ELDER BOARDS 1865–66 by Geoffrey Hargreaves In the mid 1860s the firm Smith , Elder published novels by Wilkie Collins (including The Woman in White) in a distinctive uniform binding aimed at the railway bookstalls. The binding is in a very unusual style for its time but has apparently escaped (in print at least) any detailed description or special notice hitherto, and indeed it may have avoided oblivion only by virtue of three examples held in the United States. Full details of this binding and its background are now given below, with a checklist of applicable Collins items. A feature of the checklist is the incorporation of figures from the Smith , Elder records. An afterword surveys the bookstall dress adopted for works of Collins (and others) by Smith , Elder from 1869 and by Chatto &amp; Windus from 1877, with a comparison of the two firms as publishers of railway fiction. In the summer of 1865 Smith , Elder acquired from Sampson Low the copyrights (and stock in hand) of seven Wilkie Collins novels. 1 Smith , Elder probably thought of adding these titles to their Cheap Editions of Standard Works series; * For location searches and general reference I thank Ed Ball , Michael Chambers , Veronica Denholm , Linda Frost , David Hume , P. Kami , Laura Macpherson , J. R. Mitchell , Anne Mouron , and Abby Yochelson ; for bibliographical details of Collins items Robert Arpots, Joanne Crane , Iwan ap Dafydd , A. Iris Donovan , David Faulds , Christina Favretto , Stephen Ferguson , William Hale , Michael Knies , Maggie Novario , Verity Orme , Molly Schwartzburg , Kathy Shoemaker , Victoria Steele , Carol A. Turley , and Y. Zhang ; and for transcripts (and insights) from the Smith , Elder ledgers Virginia Murray and Murray Simpson (ledger details are used here by permission of the Trustees of the National Library of Scotland ). I also thank Tom Tanselle for some library contact details; and above all my wife Jan for the Anthony Trollope quotation (note 9) and for her help and support throughout. Finally my thanks to everyone involved in supplying me with photocopies. 1 In imprints the full name of the Smith , Elder firm was Smith , Elder and Co. and that of Sampson Low ’s firm (in the 1860s) was Sampson Low , Son and Co. or (from late 1863) Sampson Low , Son and Marston (accidentals vary for both firms). The novels (with details of first British book publication) were Antonina (3 vols, Richard Bentley 1850), Basil (3 vols, Richard Bentley 1852), Hide and Seek (3 vols, Richard Bentley 1854), The Dead Secret (2 vols, Bradbury and Evans 1857), The Queen of Hearts (3 vols, Hurst and Blackett 1859), The Woman in White (3 vols, Sampson Low 1860), and No Name (3 vols, Sampson Low 1862). The Smith , Elder ledgers (see notes 16 and 18 below) record Sampson Low stock received; the figures include 27 copies of The Woman in White in three volumes and 381 of No Name in three volumes but the stock mostly comprised one-volume copies, produced for Low in the 1860s, of each of the seven novels. All ledger entries recording this stock are dated 24 July 1865; pagination concurrences in the transmission suggest that one-volume stereos for each novel were also received – for a good account of Victorian stereotyping see Allan C. Dooley , Author and Printer in Victorian England (Charlottesville and London : Univ. Press of Virginia , 1992), pp. 55–78. Collins’s next novel, Armadale, was already in the hands of Smith , Elder, who had been running it in The Cornhill Magazine since November 1864 (the run was completed in June 1866). this originated in 1857 with Jane Eyre and already included Collins’s After Dark , which was added in 1859. 2 Volumes in the series were bound in smooth cloth (usually orange) printed in black from type or stereotype, and were mostly priced at 2s.6d. each; the front cover featured a representation (reset) of the title page, in an added triple-rule frame with an ornament at the corners and "PRICE HALF-A-CROWN" between the bottom inner rules, and was clearly intended for bookstall display. 3 By 1865, however, a binding of pictorial boards with images derived from the text had become an established dress for cheap one-volume impressions of successful novels (railway fiction). 4 These were printed in color on the front cover and spine from woodblocks and furnished all over with a colored 2 Chester W. Topp , Victorian Yellowbacks &amp; Paperbacks, 1849–1905 , 9 vols ( Denver , Colorado : Hermitage Antiquarian Bookshop, 1993–2006), V, 193 (no. 19) and 201 (no. 44). A prospectus (apparently for this series), dated 1857 and printed on the front pastedown of my 1857 copy of the second item in the series ( Charlotte Brontë ’s Shirley ), highlights the Brontës and lists Collins as one of the other authors, though his only title then in the hands of Smith , Elder was After Dark (first British book publication 2 vols, Smith , Elder 1856). As Topp indicates (V, 193), the nomenclature of this mainly fiction series is a problem: the 1857 prospectus fails to name it at all, and the names and lists that initially emerge seem to be sectional (e.g., Smith , Elder &amp; Co.’s Cheap Series of Fictions); but from ca. 1859 to ca. 1868 a single list is found, usually under the name Cheap Editions of Standard Works. (The volumes are not numbered, and the identity of the series depends on adverts and uniform binding styles.) This was Smith , Elder’s first venture in railway fiction. 3 Walter E. Smith , The Brontë Sisters: A Bibliographical Catalogue of First and Early Editions 1846–1860 (Los Angeles: Heritage Book Shop, 1991), illus. on pp. 34, 66, 98, 118, 144, 164; Topp, V, color plates [18]-[20]. Although the cloth is over thin board it is not called "limp" in the adverts (cf. note 41 below). The rear cover (repeating the front cover frame but without the price) and the facing surfaces (pale yellow) of the endpapers carry Smith , Elder adverts. Leaf dimensions are approx. 6¾ – 6 3/4 × 4 1/4 in. (all edges cut) in examples of eight volumes 1857–60. Three shorter novels in the series were priced at 2s. each (see further note 10 below). 4 The term "yellowback" has been associated with almost any Victorian book priced at 2s.6d. or less and in a binding suitable for bookstall display irrespective of material and color, and it seems best avoided in discussion of particular binding styles. By "boards" here I mean fibre boards overlaid with colored (occasionally white) and glazed paper which carries printed design and lettering; I use "pictorial" when the front cover design includes an obvious picture as a main feature, and "decorated" when the design is entirely or essentially ornamental; and I distinguish between a "text-derived" picture specific to an individual volume (in fiction usually illustrating a significant moment) and a "series-derived" picture (such as the locomotive scene for the first phase of Routledge’s Railway Library) applicable to any volume in the series. For the development, from the:840s, of pictorial and decorated boards see Michael Sadleir , "Yellow-Backs," in John Carter (ed.), New Paths in Book Collecting ( London : Constable, 1934), pp. 127–161 (esp. pp. 127–142). This fundamental essay is unillustrated, but there are fine related half-tones in Sadleir ’s XIX Century Fiction: A Bibliographical Record Based on His Own Collection, 2 vols ( London : Constable, 1951), mainly in II; and there are fine color plates (on plate paper), above all in each volume of Topp, but also in Ian Rogerson , The Victorian Yellowback Book [Exhibition Catalogue], 2nd ed. ( Manchester : Manchester Polytechnic Library, 1984) and Jarndyce ( London ), Catalogue CXLI: Fine Yellowbacks (2001). Rogerson and Jarndyce CXLI are also helpful supplements to the great store of detail in XIX Century Fiction and Topp. (I have used the good 1969 Cooper Square impression of XIX Century Fiction. ) ground (usually a shade of yellow). 5 Volumes in this style were mostly priced at 2s. each. 6 Sampson Low himself, prior to parting with the copyrights, had accorded this style to The Woman in White in 1864 and to The Queen of Hearts and Antonina in 1865, though his price per volume was 2s.6d. 7 Smith , Elder had in fact made no additions to their printed cloth series since the beginning of 1864, 8 but they had not yet ventured into pictorial boards. A further option was the is . paperback, and in 1865 Smith , Elder themselves were publishing a Monthly Volume of Standard Authors series at is . (originally the Shilling Series of Standard Works of Fiction) in text-derived pictorial wrappers printed in black on orange. 9 But this venture seems to have been geared for the shorter novel, 10 and none of 5. The establishment of text-derived pictorial boards on railway fiction was largely the result of the style’s adoption in 1854 by Routledge’s Railway Library (1848–99), which initially employed series-derived pictorial boards (1848–50, following the 1847 lead of The Parlour Library) and then moved for a time into decorated styles (1851–ca. 1855) – this Routledge sequence can be followed in Topp, I, 1–85 and color plates [2]–[6]; see also Sadleir , XIX Century Fiction, II, 167–168 and plates 15 and 8. (Previously unpublished novels occasionally appeared in railway dress and at railway prices.) 6. Sources cited in note 4 above indicate that prices during the 1850s were usually is . or is .6d. for series-derived and decorated boards and is .6d. or 2s. for text-derived, with 2s. standard for text-derived from ca. 1860. (Topp also indicates that corresponding cheap fiction in cloth usually cost 6d. extra.) 7. Topp, IV, 282–284 (nos. 67, 70, 73); for covers of The Queen of Hearts see checklist below; the three items were advertised together by Low as "uniform" (presumably with specific pictorial work) in The Publishers’ Circular, 16 May 1865, p. 267; Low’s stock for them was acquired by Smith , Elder (see checklist). As early as 1856 James Blackwood had published Basil in this style (at is .6d.) – Sadleir , XIX Century Fiction, no. 3447(5); Andrew Gasson , Wilkie Collins : An Illustrated Guide ( Oxford [and] New York : Oxford Univ. Press, 1998), p. 20 (with illus.); Topp, VIII, 375 (no. 31); the Smith , Elder ledgers record 198 copies from Low of seemingly this Basil ("old edition 1/6d"). 8. The volume added at that time was Harriet Martineau’s Household Education – Topp, V, 214 (no. 97); this is the 30th volume listed by Topp in the series, which by then included the seven Brontë novels (in 6 vols 1857 – 60) and Elizabeth Gaskell’s The Life of Charlotte Brontë (added 1859). 9. The development of paperbacks in the 1850s and 1860s is outlined in Topp, I, x–xi. This numbered Smith , Elder series, dating from the end of 1861 (Topp, V, 208–209), was in fact a pioneer of the paperback novel series. The title (but not the numbering sequence) was changed in the spring of 1865 with no. 26 (Topp, V, 216), and the series was taken over by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1868 at no. 46 (Topp, III, 351). No cover details of the Shilling Series phase seem to be available, though Anthony Trollope may have had it in mind when he referred to "the yellow shilling-novel depôt" of " Mr. [W.H.] Smith’s book-stall" (at a railway station) in chapter xxxiv of The Small House at Allington (first British serial publication in The Cornhill Magazine, September 1862-April 1864; quoted here from this source – August 1863, p. 211). For cover details of the Monthly Volume phase (which included new impressions or issues of Shilling Series titles with their original numbering) see Topp, V, 215 (no. 103) and Smith , Elder frontispiece; see also Michael Collie , George Meredith : A Bibliography ( London : Dawsons , 1974), p. 17 ( Farina 1865); these examples have a Smith , Elder advert (from type or stereo) on the rear cover, and so (for the series) has my copy of an 1865 Monthly Volume Hawksview (no. 12, published in the Shilling Series phase 1862). The covers of my example are unglazed and its leaf dimensions are approx. 6 3/4 × 4 1/4 in. (all edges cut flush with the covers). 10. Of the 45 Shilling Series or Monthly Volume novels listed under Smith , Elder in Topp (V, 208–224), 21 were accorded first British book publication in one volume (1852–63, mostly at 10s.6d.), 18 in two volumes (1851–65 at 2 is .), and only 6 in the standard three volumes (1852–59 at 3 is .6d.) including Counterparts (no. 36), which is described by Topp (V, 220) as an abridgement in its Monthly Volume edition. ( A Lost Love, The School for Fathers, and Paul Ferroll , which comprised respectively nos. 19, 31, and 33 in the paperback series, had appeared in the printed cloth series at 2s. each in 1858, and are to be found in Topp under that year, see V, 197 – 199.) All the two- and three-deckers and a remarkable 18 of the singles were Smith , Elder’s own. the contributing authors (except perhaps George Meredith ) stood in the same rank as Collins . Nevertheless there must have been considerable surprise around the bookstalls when, in the autumn of 1865, Collins volumes began appearing from Smith , Elder at 2s.6d. in a binding of decorated boards printed in black on brownish red. There seem to be no published details of this binding so far available. Identically on both covers 11 a wide rectangular ornamental frame encloses the title and author lettered in black (slightly ornamented roman caps, with outlining in main words of title); the frame, which contains criss-cross and foliage work and has a four-petal design in each corner, 12 incorporates the price ("HALF A CROWN") at the top and the publishers at the bottom lettered in brownish red (sans serif roman caps formed by unprinted ground); the panel carrying the title and author has a spray ornament in each corner, a small five-point star above the title, a swelled rule between title and author, and a triple-loop ornament below the author. On the spine the decoration consists of interlinked oval, rectangular, and triangular designs; and the lettering (style as covers, according to color) comprises the title in black, the author in brownish red, and at the foot, below the price ("2/6" encircled) in black, the publishers in brownish red. Decorated boards on railway fiction would have been very familiar in the early 1850s but could not have been anticipated at the bookstalls of 1865. 13 Surviving examples of this Collins binding (it seems unconnected with any series) are evidently very scarce; 14 an extensive search has located just three (one on The Dead Secret [see figure 1 ] and one on No Name, both in Atlanta , and one on The Woman in White in Austin ), 15 as well as the Los Angeles copy in Sampson Low pictorial boards of a Smith , Elder issue of The Queen of Hearts; also located were four Collins items which are likely to have been published in Smith , Elder 2s.6d. boards but are not in a publisher’s binding now. 11. The rear cover of boarded railway fiction not uncommonly repeats the front in the 1850s but in general carries an advert (usually involving type or stereo) for other books from the publisher or the product(s) of some other trade. 12. The corner decoration of the frame has some affinity with that of the frame on the covers of the Monthly Volume paperback. Everything on the Collins covers (and spine) seems to be from woodblock. 13. Illustrations of decorated boards on railway fiction of the early 1850s appear in C. E. Frazer Clark , Jr, Nathaniel Hawthorne: A Descriptive Bibliography (Pittsburgh: Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1978), pp. 154, 174, 202; see also sources cited in note 4 above. By 1865 the decorated style was obsolete for railway fiction, though there was a more sustained revival in the 1880s (with Chinese-red printing) for Macmillan’s Two Shilling Novels series – Topp, V, color plates [4]-[7], [12]. At 2s.6d. the Smith , Elder Collins volumes must have seemed overpriced as well as out of date. 14. There is no reference to any in Sadleir , XIX Century Fiction or in Topp, though without the pioneering record of XIX Century Fiction and the great chronicle of Victorian Yellowbacks my search would never have begun. (The Topp entries are based on contemporary listings and the Topp Collection; they include notes on the British and often American publishing history of all titles traced.) figure 1. Binding of Wilkie Collins , The Dead Secret ( London : Smith , Elder , 1865), Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Emory University, PZ 3 .C66 D 4 1865. These eight items do at least represent all seven Collins titles newly acquired by Smith , Elder ; and combined evidence from other sources, including the firm’s ledgers, 16 indicates that Smith , Elder published all these titles at 2s.6d. each in their own boards in 1865–66, though clearly more examples in boards are needed. I hope that the following checklist, which incorporates ledger details, will lead to further discoveries. These general notes to the checklist that follows: The list covers only the first Smith , Elder publishing of each title at 2s.6d. PC = The Publishers’ Circular, published by Sampson Low. References are to the usually twice-monthly lists of the "New Works" (including new "editions" often deriving from an earlier typesetting) published during the preceding fortnight (or thereabouts). For Topp see footnotes 2 and 14. All located copies have on the title page a Smith , Elder imprint and the entry heading date and are without internal illustration. Descriptions are based on information supplied by holding libraries. The ledgers give the size of all items in the checklist as "Foolscap 8vo" (headings). 17 Binding figures in the checklist are normally those of only the earliest date. 18 15. The three examples were eventually located thanks to the OCLC WorldCat database (via subscribing libraries). My description derives from photocopies (covers and spine) of two examples (The Woman in White and The Dead Secret) and verbal accounts of all three. The only non- Collins candidate for this binding seems to be an 1866 The Conscript by Erckmann &amp; Chatrian (in translation) listed by Topp – V, 222 (no. 133) – as published by Smith , Elder in boards at 2s.6d., but an extensive search has failed to locate any copies of this. 16. The Smith , Elder ledgers (from July 1853 until the firm was absorbed by John Murray in 1917) are part of the John Murray Archive, which was acquired from the Murray family by the National Library of Scotland in 2005. 17. Such terms were used (inconsistently) in Victorian publishing to indicate size (the listings in PC mostly give the size of these items as plain "12mo" – a usage for any rather small volume). The designations are distinct from bibliographical format – see G. Thomas Tanselle , "The Concept of Format," Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000), 67–115 (pp. 92–95) – and I use them here for reference purposes only. Leaf dimensions of copies in Smith , Elder boards are approx. 6 5/8 × 4 3/8 in. (all edges cut). After the size the ledgers give a price of 2s.6d. each for The Woman in White, The Dead Secret, and Hide and Seek but no price for the other items (2s.6d. each is given for the seven items in printed sources). As well as Low’s foolscap stock (in or for boards) of The Woman in White, Antonina , and The Queen of Hearts, Smith , Elder acquired his "Crown 8vo" stock (in or for cloth) of all seven titles: The Woman in White 454 copies, Antonina 332, The Dead Secret 192, The Queen of Hearts 368, Hide and Seek 572, Basil 219, No Name 4304; leaf dimensions of copies in Low cloth (with illustrative matter in the prelims) in the Parrish Collection at Princeton are approx. 7 1/2 (7 7/8 for No Name) × 5 in. (all edges untrimmed). Low’s crown cloth price (according to The English Catalogue of Books 1835–62 and 1863 –71) was 5s. each except No Name at 6s. There are indications in the ledgers (but not in PC or The English Catalogue 1863 –71) that Smith , Elder issued some of this crown stock as such in cloth; two 1865 examples were offered in Jarndyce , Catalogue XCIII: Wilkie Collins (1993), nos. 52 (The Dead Secret) and 68 (The Woman in White), but survivors again seem very scarce. 18. All ledger figures in this article are from National Library of Scotland MS.43204 or (in a few specified instances) MS.43206. The dates in the ledgers seem to be accounting dates rather than production or delivery dates. Collins Novels in Smith , Elder Boards 1865–66 The Woman in White 1865.

Clowes and Sons, Stamford Street). The three 1861 Low crown copies of The Woman in White in the Parrish Collection and the Jarndyce copy of the 1865 Smith , Elder crown issue (see note 17 above) also have a Clowes imprint; I have failed to locate a Low foolscap (2s.6d.) copy (such copies were first published about ten months before the transfer to Smith , Elder ). 20. PC actually specifies cloth here, perhaps for want of information; there are Smith , Elder adverts in PC for all items except Antonina and No Name but they do not specify the binding (the listings in PC give references to the adverts). 21. The copy of The Woman in White dated 1865 and located by the NUC (0552588) at the Library of Congress may be of this issue but has been missing since 1906 (the LC card catalogue specifies Smith , Elder ). 22. Rebinding entries suggest that some copies received from Low were already bound in Low boards; there is a rebinding entry (style unspecified) of 1 July 1865 for 101 further copies (and there is an entry of that date for binding 750 further copies in boards). 23. The Surrey firm of Billing (address here Billing, printer and stereotyper, Guildford , Surrey ) evidently printed (as J. Billing , printer, Woking, Surrey ) the first edition of Anne Brontë’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (3 vols 1848) for T. C. Newby (who printed many of the novels in his 1840s list himself) – see my "Signatures and Dashes in Novels Printed by T. C. Newby in the Eighteen-Forties," Studies in Bibliography 34 (1981), 253–258 (p. 258). The two 1861 Low crown copies of Antonina in the Parrish Collection also have a Billing ( Guildford ) imprint. I have failed to locate a Low foolscap (2s.6d.) copy, though there was one in Jarndyce , Catalogue XCIII, no. 19, in original boards (such copies were first published about two and a half months before the transfer to Smith , Elder ). 24. The English Catalogue (another Low publication and presumably based on PC) in its annual volume for 1865 lists Antonina in boards at 2s.6d. as published by Smith , Elder in May, but there must be confusion here with Low’s own 2s.6d. Antonina , which is listed in PC, 16 May 1865, p. 258 (Topp rightly questions a May date for the Smith , Elder issue). The confusion is almost certainly carried over into the 1863 –71 cumulation of The English Catalogue but disguised by the absence of month dates in cumulations prior to 1890–97. (For some corroboration of Smith , Elder ’s 2s.6d. price see note 26 below.) Ledgers: 1211 copies from Sampson Low 24 July 1865 Binding 100 copies in boards 25 7 August 1865 The Dead Secret 1865.

Smith , Elder impression, printer’s imprint probably of Smith , Elder . 25. Smith , Elder ’s expectations for Antonina seem to have been no greater in 1865 than some fifteen years earlier when they had refused it in manuscript – see Leonard Huxley , The House of Smith Elder ( London : Printed for Private Circulation, 1923), p. 152 – and they probably did not report it to PC; the next binding entry, however, is for 200 copies in boards (1 July 1866). Collins in turn had refused George Smith’s 1860 offer of £500 for the first British book edition (and copyright?) of The Woman in White ( Huxley , pp. 152–153, in this case quoting Smith’s recollections dictated in 1899 – see Huxley , pp. 196–197). 26. The advert includes a "New Edition. Fcap. 8vo. 2s.6d." of The Woman in White, with the following note in italics under the entry: "New Editions of all Mr. Wilkie Collins’s Works, uniform in size and price with ‘The Woman in White,’ will shortly be published." Whatever Smith , Elder intended here, I believe my checklist of their Collins items at 2s.6d. in boards (again the advert gives no style) is complete. The only other evidence for any addition seems to be an advert in The Athenaeum of 3 November 1866 8(see Topp, V, 202) for After Dark (already available at 2s.6d. in cloth) at 2s.6d. in boards, but the signs from the ledgers are that Smith , Elder were re-advertising here and that confusion arose about the binding: there is an entry of 2 November 1866 for 1000 (+15 surplus) further copies of the foolscap 8vo After Dark (1859 edition) printed and another of that date for binding 250 further copies in cloth (cf. note 20 above). 27. Smith , Elder ’s printing capacity (address here Old Bailey, E.C. – so in the checklist’s Hide and Seek and Basil) dated from 1855 when they took over the printing house of Stewart and Murray in Little Green Arbour Court (15 Old Bailey). In 1872 they made over this capacity to Spottiswoode and Co. in exchange for future printing services – see Sir Sidney Lee , "Memoir of George Smith " [1901] in The Dictionary of National Biography, I (1968 impression), xxi-lix (p. xxxiv); Huxley , pp. 84–85. 28. PC specifies cloth again here but boards for the remaining items. 29. The copy of The Dead Secret dated 1865 and located by the NUC (0552^8) at the Library of Congress has been missing since 1906 and is not further identifiable. 30. The address here is Billing, printer, Guildford , Surrey – so in the Low foolscap (2s.6d.) copies at Emory University (Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library) and the National Library of Wales (Low foolscap copies were first published about five months before the transfer to Smith , Elder ).

On the front cover, in a heart-shaped frame above the price ("HALF-A-CROWN"), three elderly men and a young woman are seated at a candle-lit table; the rear cover advertises New Works for Railway and Home Reading ( Sampson Low) and has an Edmund Evans imprint (address engraver and printer, Raquet Court, Fleet Street) at the bottom – description from color photocopies. The Emory and NLW Low foolscap (2s.6d.) copies (NLW respined) show these cover details too (for the importance of Evans in the development and production of text-derived pictorial boards see Sadleir , "Yellow-Backs," pp. 141 –142, 147–149, and XIX Century Fiction, II, 3). 33. A rebinding entry (56 copies, style unspecified) of 1 July 1866 suggests that some copies received were already bound in Low boards, but I believe that hybrids such as the UCLA copy (cf. Sadleir , XIX Century Fiction, no. 3693) result from receipt of unused binding cases and their employment on unbound copies (with a substitute title-leaf or preliminary gathering) rather than from a substitution job on bound copies. (There is also an entry of 1 July 1866 for binding 750 further copies in boards.) 34.

Graff , Baltimore . Ledgers: [No print-run recorded] Binding 3500 copies in boards 38 6 July 1866 Afterword By 1872 Collins in Smith , Elder decorated boards at 2s.6d. per volume had been superseded by Collins in Smith , Elder pictorial boards at the usual price. In the autumn of 1869, after beginning the year with a move from 65 Cornhill to the superior premises of 15 Waterloo Place, 39 Smith , Elder at last ventured into the pictorial boards market as part of a revival and restyling of their Cheap Editions of Standard Works series. 40 This now became Cheap Editions of Popular Works 35. The specification of cloth here is almost certainly an error for boards: the entered cost (£8 10s. per thousand) is the same as that for all the checklisted binding in boards, while the cost for binding the foolscap 8vo After Dark 1859 edition) in cloth at that time is entered as £10 5s. per thousand. The 198(?) copies of the "old edition 1/6d" (see note 7 above) were still on hand in December 1868 (MS.43206 – entry for 199 copies) but disappear thereafter. 36. The ledgers record 4304 crown copies from Low; there is a copy (in black library buckram) of an 1865 Smith , Elder crown issue at the University of California , Berkeley , with traces of frontispiece, text ending on p. 548, and printer’s imprint of Clowes (address William Clowes and Sons, Stamford Street and Charing Cross); the 1864 Low crown copy in the Parrish Collection also has a Clowes imprint. The use of crown stock for foolscap issue would have left a great many copies of the frontispiece (by Millais ) spare, but these would have had some sales potential in themselves and would have been potentially useful for an illustrated impression or issue such as Smith , Elder ’s of 1876 (copy in Parrish Collection). 37. Clowes address as in the Berkeley copy of the 1865 Smith , Elder crown issue (see note 36 above). 38. MS.43206. There is also a binding entry of 1 July 1868 for 250 further copies in boards (MS.43206) but this of course has no intrinsic connection with 1868 issue; probably a fresh batch of substitute title-leaves (or preliminary gatherings) had to be printed in 1868 and was updated. 39. Huxley , pp. 177–179 (see also plate facing p. 178 and frontispiece); Topp, V, 226. 40. There were no additions to the series in 1865 – 68 (the period of George Smith’s preoccupation with The Pall Mall Gazette - Huxley , p. 177). The ledgers show that from ca. 1867 existing titles (including After Dark) were marketed for a time in part leather bindings ("half roan" or "roxburghe" – both probably what would now be called "quarter leather"); I now think that the binding on an 1867 Shirley (with price "2/6" at foot of spine) at the Brontë Parsonage Museum is an example of the "half roan" style and not a special offer of an earlier 6s. "half morocco" Brontë style – see my " Smith , Elder ’s 1857 – 60 Edition of the Brontë Life and Works," Brontë Studies 29 (2004), 17–26 (p. 22 and note 13). in two sections, one comprising 2s.6d. volumes in smooth green cloth blocked in black and gold. 41 The other comprised 2s. volumes in text-derived pictorial boards along established lines with a cream or pale yellow ground, though the four spine ornaments and the front-cover gothic lettering are distinctive. 42 The first nine volumes in pictorial boards were published in the autumn of 1869 and included No Name . 43 This was the only Collins addition of 1869–70, but in 1871 the other six titles of the above checklist were added to the pictorial boards section, as were After Dark (previously in the green cloth section) and Armadale . 44 From about 1872 the series was also advertised as Smith , Elder and Co.’s Popular Library 45 – a fitting name for a series featuring the Brontës (in the green cloth section 46 ) and Wilkie Collins . But despite the fact that Smith , Elder had by 41. The size of volumes in the green cloth section is given in adverts as foolscap 8vo. I provided an illustration and fuller description of the green cloth binding in Brontë Studies 29 (2004), 21 (fig. 7), 22 (at that time I had not worked out the history of the series as a whole). In this binding the endpapers are plain (with facing surfaces of pale yellow) and the leaves (in copies of four volumes 1870–75) measure approx. 6 5/8 × 4 3/8 in. (all edges cut). The cloth is called "limp" (over thin board) in the adverts (I have seen one example of it with a pebble grain – on my copy of an 1884 Shirley ). Five 2s. volumes arising in the cloth section in 1870–71 ( Mrs Gaskell’s tales) were eliminated by redistribution ca. 1884. Some of the cloth section volumes have an engraved frontispiece. 42. Topp, V, color plates [21]-[32]; Pierre Coustillas, George Gissing : The Definitive Bibliography (High Wycombe: Rivendale Press, 2005), plate [10] with uniform ca. 1890 spines (on spines of ca. 1870 seen by me the top three ornaments are more compact except on the extra-wide Armadale spine where all four are much elongated). An advert for the series usually occupies the rear cover but from ca. 1890 is sometimes replaced by one for Dr Rooke’s medicines. The endpapers are white and usually plain but from ca. 1890 are sometimes occupied (on all visible surfaces) by non-book adverts. The leaves (in copies of four volumes 1870–75) measure approximately 6 3/4 × 4 3/8 in. (all edges cut). Early adverts for the revived series do not specify the size of volumes in boards, but later ones give it as foolscap 8vo. (The spine of pictorial boards tends to be ornamental rather than pictorial.) 43. PC, 15 October 1869, pp. 647–649, listing all nine volumes; No Name – see Topp, V, 221 (no. 128) – is the only one new to the series as a whole, the other eight being transfers from the Standard Works phase (see Topp, V, Smith , Elder nos. 39, 42, 45, 51, 59, 61, 83, 92). 44.

(I have not pursued details of Afterword items in the ledgers.) 45. All Popular Library (briefly preceded by Popular Editions) adverts I have seen are on text paper in the final gathering of some volumes; the Cheap Editions of Popular Works version (which I have not seen internally) persists as the usual advert on the rear cover of volumes in boards (Topp does not attempt to designate the series beyond ca. 1870). 46. As a rule the two sections appear to be mutually exclusive, but there is evidence in the adverts that Collins became an exception; and PC, 16 November 1872, p. 769 lists (in a single entry) all nine Collins titles concerned as published by Smith , Elder in cloth at 2s.6d. each, though I cannot point to a surviving example. this time acquired rights to The Moonstone and Man and Wife, there were no further Collins additions to the series. 47 Apparently there was disagreement between Collins and George Smith about pricing policy (in the bookstall range), and in 1875 these two titles, together with six of the Collins titles in the series, were transferred to the new firm of Chatto &amp; Windus (founded 1873). 48 Smith , Elder retained After Dark, No Name, and Armadale until after the death of Collins in 1889, but these titles were in the hands of Chatto &amp; Windus by the end of 1890. 49 Chatto &amp; Windus were the main British publishers of Collins from 1875 and eventually included twenty-nine volumes of his fiction at 2s. each in their Cheap Editions of Popular Novels series. 50 This was the last great series of Victorian railway fiction and again comprised 2s. volumes in text-derived pictorial boards of the established kind. 51 In the mid 1890s, when it was at or near its peak, the Chatto &amp; Windus Popular Novels series ran to about 575 volumes, whereas the Smith , Elder Popular Library total at a similar time and stage was about 130 volumes (of which about 50 were in the 2s.6d. cloth section). 52 Smith , Elder did make an important contribution to railway fiction, but they were perhaps never comfortable in a market often resembling the railway mania from which the bookstalls emerged. 47. The Moonstone and Man and Wife (first British book publication respectively 3 vols, Tinsley Brothers 1868 and 3 vols, F. S. Ellis 1870) seem to have been published by Smith , Elder in cloth (crown 8vo) only (1871, 5s. each) – see Topp, III, 45-47. 48. Huxley , pp. 153-154 (quoting Smith's recollections, 1899); Gasson (see note 7 above), p. 141 ( Gasson’s Guide is a valuable source of bibliographical information). Smith is hazy on the details but recalls clearly his view that the price advocated by Collins was too low; and in the event Chatto &amp; Windus themselves do not seem to have published any Collins title at less than 2s. until 1894, when they ventured a two-column setting of The Woman in White at 6d. (paperback) or is. (limp cloth) – Topp, III, 231 (no. 1042). 49. Topp, III, 192-193. 50. The first fifteen Collins volumes are in Topp III under the year 1877 and the final Collins volume (Blind Love) is under 1891 (Topp does not use a designation for this series – the volumes are unnumbered and the name only transpires from adverts). Eight examples (various impressions or issues) of the Collins volumes are listed in Sadleir , XIX Century Fiction, II, 27 and sixteen in Robert Lee Wolff , Nineteenth-Century Fiction: A Bibliographical Catalogue, 5 vols ( New York &amp; London: Garland Publishing, 1981-86), I, 257-269 (the Wolff Collection is at the Harry Ransom Center). 51. Topp, III, color plates [6]-[32]. 52. The Popular Novels figure is based on a Chatto &amp; Windus catalogue of March 1895, pp. 29-32 and the Popular Library figure on adverts of ca. 1895 and ca. 1896. The Popular Library cloth figure includes about ten volumes "in limp red cloth, crown 8vo" (adverts) from a 2s.6d. subsidiary section introduced ca. 1890 – I have not seen an example. By ca. 1895 the two main (foolscap) sections of the Popular Library each had an (eventually superseding) alternative binding (2s.6d.): the green cloth section one of smooth rigid dark green cloth, with spine ruled and lettered (head lettering rule framed) in gold, and leaf tops gilt, but covers plain (not one for the bookstall unless via a dust jacket); and the pictorial boards section one of grained limp red cloth blocked in black, with spine ( Coustillas , plate [10]) lettered in gold and front cover lettered in red and black. MARK TWAIN AND BRET HARTE: A MYSTERIOUS EARLY PIRACY IN CONTEXT by Richard Bucci I On 14 March 1866 an anthology of humorous writings called Wit and Humor; or, Odds and Ends was advertised in the New York Daily Tribune. Readers were encouraged to send the publisher, J. R. Sutherland and Co. of Philadelphia , $1.50 for a cloth-bound book or $1.00 for a paperback; in return they would receive a "thick volume" of selections, many by featured contributors with nationally recognized names. From that date the volume was the subject of an extensive advertising campaign which did not end until the third week of May. Advertisements for Wit and Humor, in four textually distinct versions, appeared in at least nine prominent American publications. The Tribune advertisement ran in each issue through 20 March. On 17 March the same text began appearing in the New York Saturday Press (see figure 1 ), the leading paper of America’s Bohemian avant-garde, where it was printed, with evident care, ultimately in nine consecutive issues. Starting on 25 March this Tribune-Saturday Press version was in turn published in two issues running of the New York Sunday Mercury, one of the widest-circulating periodicals in the nation. A second version, with wording that described an apparently later conception of the volume, likewise began on 14 March, in the Washington, D.C ., Daily National Republican. This form was in turn printed in the Round Table (see figure 2 ), New York’s self-consciously stuffy literary weekly, on 24 and 31 March. The text is also distinguished by the inclusion of "Mrs. Partington " as a contributor and the omission of "Pomeroy Brick." On 15 March a third version, reflecting the change to Mrs. Partington and today conspicuous for the error "Mark Train," made the first of six appearances in the New York Times. This text, misprint and all, would reappear later in the month, beginning on 26 March, in six issues of the Boston Evening Transcript. A fourth version, including both "Mrs. Partington " and "Pomeroy Brick" but omitting "Josh Billings," appeared in every issue of the New York Evening Express from 23 through 31 March and in every issue of the Springfield (Mass.) Republican from 27 March through 2 April. 1 1. Advertisements for Wit and Humor; or, Odds and Ends, have been found in the following publications and issues: Daily Tribune ( New York ). 14 through 20 March 1866 (p. 2) Saturday Press ( New York ). Vol. 5; 17, 24, and 31 March, 7, 14, 21, 28 April, and 5 and 12 May (p. 8 of each issue). Sunday Mercury ( New York ). Vol. 28; 25 March (p. 7) and 1 April (p. 6). Clipper ( New York ). Vol. 13; 31 March (p. 405) and 7 April (p. 413). The Field and Fireside (Raleigh, N. C.). Vol. 12; 14, 21, and 28 April (pp. 119, 127, and 135, respectively). Daily National Republican ( Washington, D.C. ). 14 through 22 March 1866 (p. 3); the paper did not issue on Sunday, 18 March. On 14 and 15 March the advertisement bore the printer's abbreviation "mh 14" (for March 14), and thereafter "mh14-6td2tw," or, (from) March 14, six times, daily to 22 (March). Round Table ( New York ). Vol. 3; 24 March (p. 189) and 31 March (p. 206; the thirteenth and fourteenth pages respectively of sixteen pages). Times ( New York ). 15 through 21 March (p. 7), except for Sunday, the 18th. Evening Transcript ( Boston ). 26 through 31 March (each time with the printer's abbreviation "mh 26 6t," a reminder to run the advertisement six times from March 26th forward). Evening Express ( New York ). Eight consecutive issues (the Evening Express did not print on Sundays), 23 through 31 March (p. 3). Republican (Springfield, Mass.). Six consecutive issues (the Republican did not print on Sundays), from 27 March through 2 April (with the printers abbreviation: m27 6d2w). The early textual versions seem to describe an early conception of the volume, before it was published (e.g., "This unique volume will also contain"), while the later version suggests that the book has already been published ("This unique volume contains ..."). The line "laugh and grow fat" is present in all advertisements except the original Tribune-Saturday Press-Sunday Mercury version. The presence of this aphorism in multi-partite titles of song books and compendia of humor dating to the mid-eighteenth century suggests that the phrase might also have been part of the title of Wit and Humor. Another substantive difference among the versions indicates that the book as initially conceived had different contents: "Darkey Wit" is listed in the three textually early versions but not in the late one. The anthology was likely a piracy: of the contributors named in the advertisements, most had national reputations, and all but two had already published their works in authorized editions. The two exceptions were "'Bret,' of The Californian" and Mark Twain . Depending on how the measurement is taken, Wit and Humor was their first book. " Bret " was of course Francis Bret Harte (1836–1902). He had already edited a book, Outcroppings: Being Selections of California Verse, which was published by Anton Roman in San Francisco in December 1865 (copyrighted 1866). Harte selected many of the poems in this volume, but included none of his own; he wrote a brief preface, but did not sign it. The first authorized book of his own writings would be called Condensed Novels and Other Papers. When assembled, the manuscript for this volume would consist mainly of pieces written for the Californian, a San Francisco literary weekly founded in 1864 by New York transplant and Outcroppings contributor Charles Henry Webb (1834 – 1905). Harte and Webb alternately edited the Californian, and in seeking a publisher for his collection, Harte may have consulted with his more worldly colleague. Eventually secured (with the help of the New York agent of Anton Roman ) was George W. Carleton , Webb's friend and publisher and the publisher of a number of other notable humorists, including Artemus Ward . When Harte's book appeared in October 1867, it drew favorable notices, but the author soon grew unhappy in his relationship with Carleton . In a letter to James R. Osgood , he revealed that his arrangement with Carleton was informal and expressed a desire to have Osgood's company publish a revised Condensed Novels (this came to pass in 1871). Harte also revealed that Carleton printed 1,800 copies of the original edition and intended to print no more; bibliographical investigation by Nathan Van Patten discovered that the edition comprised separate issues, in 1867 and 1870, likely constituted respectively of 1,500 and 300 copies. FIGURE 1. One of the versions of the advertisement in its early state: example from the New York Saturday Press, 31 March 1866, p. 8 (original size approximately 4.5 × 7.0 cm). FIGURE 2. The later state of the advertisement: example from the Round Table 3 (24 March 1866): 189 (original size approximately 5.5 × 7.5 cm). Harte brought out a second book two or three months after Condensed Novels appeared: The Lost Galleon and Other Tales was a collection of some of his poems, finely printed by Towne and Bacon in San Francisco at the end of 1867. This volume also drew notice in the East, though it was unfavorably compared to Condensed Novels and Harte was warned of adopting a poetic demeanor imitative of Holmes. 2 As for Mark Twain , he would beat Harte to market by five months with a book of his own, despite its having been refused in prospect by Carleton in early 1867. 3 The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, And other Sketches appeared at the end of April 1867, through the enterprising efforts of the ubiquitous Webb. He had returned to New York one year earlier, and sold his interest in the Californian within a few months (having briefly considered transferring it to New York ). 4 Mark Twain followed him to New York in January 1867, where Webb arranged for him to see Carleton about publishing a collection of his sketches from the 2. See Harte to James R. Osgood and Co., 30 May 1870 (MS in the Stanford University Library), printed in Nathan Van Patten , Concerning "Condensed Novels" by Bret Harte (Stanford Univ. Press, 1929), pp. xix–xxi. Van Patten discusses the two issues of the Carleton Condensed Novels on pp. xi–xv; see also Harte to Fields, Osgood and Co., 23 April 1869, in The Letters of Bret Harte , ed. Geoffrey Bret Harte ( Boston and New York : Houghton Mifflin, 1926), p. 6. Carleton first announced Condensed Novels on 1 October 1867 ("Announcements," American Literary Gazette 9 [1 October 1867]: 306); Carleton also reportedly claimed to be the " New York publishers of Harte's Lost Galleon," though the company probably distributed the copies printed by Towne and Bacon ("Table Talk," Round Table 7 [21 March 1868]: 187). Condensed Novels was reviewed in the Atlantic Monthly 21 (January 1868): 128. For reviews of The Lost Galleon and Other Tales, see "Library Table," Round Table 7 (14 March 1868): 169–170; Nation 6 (23 April 1868): 335; and Putnam's Magazine, new series 1 (May 1868): 644. In his Bret Harte : A Bibliography Gary Scharnhorst cites reviews in the Western press that indicate that The Lost Galleon was released in San Francisco in December 1867, perhaps two and one-half months after Condensed Novels (Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 1995, see p. 195). 3. Reacting to Carleton's rejection in a letter to Charles Warren Stoddard in San Francisco , Mark Twain wrote from New York , "How is Bret ? He is publishing with a Son of a Bitch who will swindle him, &amp; he may print that opinion if he chooses, with my name signed to it. I don't know how his book is coming on—we of Bohemia keep away from Carleton's " (23 April 1867, Mark Twain's Letters, Volume 2: 1867-1868 [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1990], p. 30). Mark Twain's self-identification in this letter, "we of Bohemia," relates to the discussion in section III of this article. Toward Carleton —who was in fact Bohemia's preferred publisher— Mark Twain nursed an animosity until a chance encounter in Switzerland in 1888, at which time, the author reported, Carleton told him,"I am substantially an obscure person, but I have at least one distinction to my credit of such colossal dimensions that it entitles me to immortality—to wit: I refused a book of yours, and for this I stand without competitor as the prize ass of the nineteenth century" ( Mark Twain , "Chapters from My Autobiography—II," North American Review 183 [September 21, 1906]: 451; see also Autobiography of Mark Twain , Volume 2, ed. Benjamin Griffin , Harriet Elinor Smith , et al. [ Mark Twain Project of the Bancroft Library, Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2013], p. 47). 4. Webb sold his one-quarter share of the Californian to the new editor, James Bowman , for about $150; the exchange is recorded in a letter to Webb from Bret Harte , in which Harte also reveals that he left the Californian on 1 August 1866 (18 October 1866, MS in The Bancroft Library, University of California ). The contemplated transfer of the Californian "from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast" was reported in an untitled paragraph in the New York Leader 11 (21 October 1865): 4. Californian and the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . Webb then came to his aid when Carleton sent the author away: he published the book himself, or jointly with the American News Company. A Webb penname, " John Paul ," appeared on the title page as editor, along with his real name as publisher; he also copyrighted the book in his own name (an action that would eventually contribute to the disruption of his relationship with the author). Apart from Wit and Humor , two other unauthorized collections published before 1867 contained Mark Twain writings. The first was Fun for Three Months ( New York : T. W. Strong, 1864 or 1865), an anthology partly composed of sheets of the humor journal Yankee Notions . In the issue of Yankee Notions for April 1864, a Mark Twain item appeared below the editorial title, "The Play of Ingomar in California ." Jacob Blanck described Fun for Three Months as a "twilight book," a classification he applied to publications "made up of the sheets of the original periodical publication, or produced from the plates thereof... ." 5 The questioned status of this volume has contributed to the tendency to regard the second unauthorized anthology, Beadle's Dime Book of Fun No. 3, as the first book in which Mark Twain's work appeared. Itself little more than a pamphlet at 80 pages, the Beadle volume was the third in a series, and it also had the appearance of a periodical. Blanck did not regard it as a periodical or a twilight book however, and it contained three items by Mark Twain , all copied from periodical printings. 6 The presumed issue date of the third Dime Book of Fun was April 19, 1866, however— more than one month later than the appearance of the first advertisements for Wit and Humor. The later versions of these advertisements imply that the volume had already been published; the advertisements also mark the first time that the names of Bret Harte and Mark Twain were used to attract Eastern readers. Unlike the Beadle volume, Wit and Humor was promoted in literary papers and advertised as an anthology of the writings of particular authors. No further sign of Wit and Humor has been discovered after the advertisement in the Saturday Press of 12 May; none of the copies that the publisher advertised as ready for shipment has been located. Of that publisher, J. R. Sutherland , little can be said with confidence. Beyond the advertised mailing address, a Philadel- 5 Fun for Three Months. Illustrated with a Large Number of Beautiful Engravings... . New York : T. W. Strong, n. d. (BAL 3308; BAL preface, p. xxi). The "Ingomar" sketch appeared under the heading "The Play of Ingomar in California " in Yankee Notions 13 (April 1864): 125. The copy consulted by Blanck was in a private collection (FCW); at least two copies are now publicly owned in the United States (at UCLA and TxU). The play Ingomar the Barbarian is an English adaptation of a German-language drama (Der Sohn der Wildnes, 1842). Mark Twain saw it produced at Maguire's Opera House in Virginia City, Nevada , and wrote a satirical review for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. The first printing in the Enterprise is not known to survive, but the text was reprinted in the San Francisco literary paper the Golden Era, which was the source of the text in Yankee Notions ("'Ingomar' over the Mountains. The 'Argument,'" Golden Era 11 [29 November 1863]: 5). 6 Beadle's Dime No. 3 Book of Fun. Comprising Good Things from the Best Wits. And a Rare Collection of Laughable Stories and Jokes ( New York : Beadle and Co., 1866, BAL 3309). In recording the title as it appeared on the title page, Blanck was aware that the publisher intended for the title to be Beadle's Dime Book of Fun No. 3. The intended word order of the title appeared on the paper cover, which is reproduced on p. 404 of vol. 1 of Albert Johannsen 's history of the Beadle company (see note 62 below). phia cxsonnection has not been established: the name is not listed as a person or business in the Philadelphia directories, and Sutherland advertisements have not been found in Philadelphia newspapers. 7 The instruction in Sutherland's advertisements, "Mailed to any address on receipt of price," is characteristic of the advertisements of publishers of cheap editions, especially the large Philadelphia establishment T. B. Peterson and Brothers. This firm frequently advertised in Eastern newspapers of this period; in the New York Tribune of 16 March 1866, for example, a T. B. Peterson advertisement appeared almost adjacent to the advertisement for Wit and Humor, offering to ship the novels of Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth "postage paid on receipt of retail price." However, most of the books by American authors on Peterson's long list were, like the novels by Mrs. Southworth , commissioned by that publisher. 8 While there will be cause further to discuss T. B. Peterson and Brothers in another context, this company was unlikely to have been connected with Wit and Humor, despite the Sutherland company's advertised Philadelphia address and similar approach to marketing and sales. J. R. Sutherland was almost certainly a Canadian firm; the evidence for this deduction is cumulative and sufficiently convincing. J. R. Sutherland and Company (and A. R. and J. R. Sutherland ) published gazetteers and business directories of Canada West counties in the early and mid-1860s. For example, J. R. or James Sutherland was compiler and publisher of the 1862 volume for Oxford County and the 1865–1866 volume for the combined counties of Northumberland and Durham; A. R. and J. R. Sutherland published the volumes for Brant County that same year, and for Kent County the previous year (1864–65). J. R.'s location was shown as Woodstock, a town in Oxford County, while the A. R. and J. R. Sutherland company was located in Ingersoll, a town ten miles further to the west in the same county. A few years earlier, possibly as far back as 1856, James Sutherland was living in the United States . There he compiled and published directories and other works at least until 1860, possibly for Michigan and Wisconsin . Beginning in 1858 he published directories for Indiana , Kansas , and Missouri , mostly with a partner named Henry N. McEvoy . Perhaps war's outbreak brought him and McEvoy to Canada , where the partnership eventually resumed: in 1870 the two men were collaborating on Canadian county directories. J. R. Sutherland was also listed in 1870 as publishing a monthly journal in Hamilton , Ontario . According to a contemporary Canadian practice, Sutherland may have been a distributor rather than the actual producer of Wit 7. McElroy's Philadelphia City Directory for 1865 ... Twenty-Eighth Edition ( Philadelphia : A. McElroy , 1865). Citations for the volumes for 1866 and 1867 are identical, but for the more recent year and publication date and correspondingly higher edition number; also searched were the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Free Press, and the American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular. 8. Peterson catalogues appear in many Peterson volumes, usually at the back. A catalogue is so printed in Speech of George Francis Train, on Irish Independence, and English Neutrality ... October 18th, 1865. A version of the following message appears at the bottom of almost every page of the catalogue in that volume: " Copies of any of the above works will be sent by Mail, free of Postage, to any part of the United States , on receipt of the retail price, by T. B. Peterson &amp; Brothers, Philadelphia ." and Humor. In attested instances of this practice a Canadian printing house would perform the presswork for a particular unauthorized edition of a work by an American author, presumably using an original American printing as printer's copy. The resulting copies would be identical except for advertising matter and different title page imprints belonging to particular Canadian news dealers. A tantalizing clue that potentially connects Wit and Humor to this practice concerns Sutherland's partner, McEvoy . In 1869, McEvoy was the editor and compiler for the C. E. Anderson company, the gazetteer and directory branch of the Daily Telegraph Printing House in Toronto . As will be discussed in the following section, this printing company, owned by John Ross Robertson and James B. Cook , produced unauthorized editions of Mark Twain's first books the following year (1870), according to the method just described. 9 However Wit and Humor may have been produced, it is likely to have been the first book in which the sketches of Bret Harte and Mark Twain were featured. The presence of their names in advertisements in the East is also without known precedent. The advertisements are important evidence of the early national esteem of California's two leading authors, and invite questions relating to the progress of their careers. As these questions are pursued, particular revelations about Bret Harte and Mark Twain disclose connections to a larger literary landscape, in its commercial and artistic dimensions, during the transformative 1860s. The deceptively narrow testimony provided by the advertisements acts ultimately as a prism through which the strands of an inadequately remembered world of publishing and authorship appear: democratic and nonconforming, centered in New York and not Boston , looking westward for new inspiration and audiences. II J. R. Sutherland's Philadelphia -based distribution strategy would have been an early and daring variation on a theme that some Toronto and Montréal publishers were about to take up with a vengeance. Within a few years of the appearance of Wit and Humor advertisements, American publishers and authors would be facing the rampant unauthorized Canadian publication of their domestically 9. Sutherland and McEvoy may have met in Indianapolis in 1858: while Sutherland was there compiling the Indiana state directory, McEvoy was publishing the city directory (see Indiana State Gazetteer and Business Directory for 1858 and 1859, James Sutherland , comp. and mgr. [ Indianapolis : George W. Hawes , 1858], pp. [iii], 155). Examples of the many directories produced jointly by Sutherland and McEvoy (which also indicate a ten-year collaboration) are The Missouri State Gazetteer and Business Directory ( St. Louis: Sutherland and McEvoy , 1860) and Sutherland's Counties of Kent and Essex Gazetteer and General Business Directory, H. N. McEvoy , comp. ( Hamilton [Ont.]: J. Sutherland [1870]). For the evidence of Henry N. McEvoy's connection with Robertson and Cook and the Daily Telegraph Printing House, see The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory, H. McEvoy , ed. and comp. ( Toronto : Robertson and Cook , 1869), title page [i], p. [ii], and the two pages of advertisements between pp. 488 and 489; also in this directory, J. Sutherland is listed as a book dealer and stationer in Brantford (p. 71). At the turn of the twentieth century, the stationer and book publishing firm of J. and J. Sutherland , located in Brantford, Ontario (Brant County), was listed as having been founded in 1854: see The International Directory of Booksellers and Bibliophile's Manual, ed. James Clegg (Rochdale [et al.]: James Cle[g]g , Aldine Press [et al.], 1899), pp. ii, 198; see also George P. Rowell &amp; Co.'s American Newspaper Directory, ed. George P. Rowell ( New York : George P. Rowell and Co., 1870), p. 761. copyrighted works. A brief exploration of this development, which involves not only Canadian publishers but London counterparts as well, can help place Wit and Humor in an historical context. In an article appearing in the New York Sun in 1878 and reprinted in the Publishers' Weekly, George W. Carleton gave an account of the situation in the extremity of its development, which was characterized by the very low prices of mail-order Canadian books. There is no copyright between England and America . Any one on either side may print the other's books and sell them in his own country... . Occasionally, of late years, where a publisher makes a handsome sum out of a foreign book, he recognizes the author's right so far as to pay him something. That is optional, but is considered the fair thing to do. But now these Canada devils go to work and take our American books and reprint them for one tenth of our prices, and sell them not only in Canada , which they have a right to do, but in our own country, to our own customers. Within a day or two they have taken to advertising in New York newspapers that they will send these reprints here to American citizens for 15 or 20 cents each; reprints of books that are sold here at $1.50 by the publishers who pay for copyrights upon them. It is a gross outrage. We can stop a bookseller here from vending these things, but it seems that we cannot prevent this Canadian fellow getting money by mail from American citizens and sending them his reprints of our books for it. 10 Mark Twain 's authorized books were destined for routine copying by Toronto and Montréal publishers, who would apply ingenious and speedy methods of production and sale. The effect the appearance of these copies had on Mark Twain 's temper is easy to imagine—his reaction was akin to the exasperation expressed by his one-time nemesis Carleton. From the title-page imprints of some of the surreptitious copies, an appearance is created that several Canadian editions were made of each of Mark Twain 's works. Gordon Roper, pioneering scholar of Canadian literature, examined the apparently different copies and discovered that some were distinguished only by their title page imprints (and sometimes advertising pages). The diverse imprints indicated not the volume's publishers, but Toronto and Montréal news vendors, booksellers, and stationers. Further evidence led Roper to the conclusion that apparently various "editions" of some titles were the work of a single publisher—though not always the same company. These companies were usually controlled, Roper further disclosed, by one or more of a handful of publishers, whom he identified as Alexander Belford , George M. Rose , John Ross Robertson , and James B. Cook . 11 Given the known profile of J. R. Sutherland , stationer and compiler of gazetteers, Wit and Humor could have followed the pattern that Roper discovered, with the distributor's 10.

Wit and Humor appeared at the dawn of an era in which American literary works were freely appropriated by Canadian publishers. American authors and publishers would struggle with the problem until 1891, when the United States finally enacted an international copyright law. At that time British and Canadian authors could at last be offered protections in America analogous to those which their American counterparts sought in the British dominions. Until then, however, the legal status of an author's work in the English-speaking world would remain insecure, and mercantile avenues for unauthorized publications remained open. By mid-century, American publishers had already made a tradition of the free appropriation of the literature of Britain ; as America 's literature matured, British publishers in their turn began to take notice. Some American authors were able to secure contracts with a British publisher, as did Irving, Cooper, and Melville with John Murray (father and son), but these agreements were supported not by the law but by the good word of the publisher and the respect he commanded from competitors. Neither Webb nor Mark Twain made such an arrangement for The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and this book proved especially vulnerable. The authorized edition appeared a scant eight weeks after the death in Southampton of Charles Farrar Browne , known as Artemus Ward (b. 1834), the young comedian mourned by a British public whose enthusiasm for American vernacular speech and humor he had done much to excite. The commercial possibilities of a book by Artemus's friend Mark Twain were not lost on George Routledge , who made three editions of Jumping Frog between 1867 and 1872, nor on Routledge's shiftier rival John Camden Hotten , who added an edition of his own in 1870. Tens of thousands of copies of the four pirated editions were sold in the British isles in a few years' time—well over ten times the sales of the American edition. 12 Though he received nothing from the Routledge and Hotten editions, Mark Twain acknowledged some years later that they contributed to his future success. At a time when he was scarcely known in the States, that is, they made him a popular author in England . He later recalled that the success of the Jumping Frog piracies led to a competitive "scramble"—presumably by the two rival houses—to secure his approval for authorized British editions of future books. 13 Artemus 12 Two of the Routledge editions, "JF4a" (1870) and "JF4b" (1872), as Robert H. Hirst has designated them, are closely related: JF4b is a reprint from the plates of JF4a with added material. Mark Twain had some foreknowledge of JF4a–b, and is said to have authorized publication, though he was not paid. Hirst discovered that 24,000 copies of the Routledge Jumping Frog were printed by July 1873, and by the same time, nearly 19,000 copies of Hotten's edition (JF3) had sold. (Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 1: 1851–1864, ed. Edgar Marquess Branch and Robert H. Hirst , The Works of Mark Twain [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1979], pp. 546–555). It is interesting that Hirst also found that Routledge had initially printed 6,000 copies of his earliest Jumping Frog (JF2); according to the learned editors of the Melville edition, "6000 copies was Routledge's usual print run for fiction reprints" (Israel Potter, op. cit., p. 221). 13 An entry in Mark Twain 's Notebook 27, which Robert H. Hirst dated January 1888, reads: "It may be a good thing sometimes for an author to have one book pirated &amp; a scramble made—I think it true. Look at my first book" ( Mark Twain 's Notebooks &amp; Journals, Volume III [1883 –1891], ed. Frederick Anderson et al., The Mark Twain Papers [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1979], p. 364; see also Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 1, ibid., p. 549). Ward, helped by his English lecture manager, Edward P. Hingston , made an agreement for authorized publication with Hotten in 1864 and seems to have been well served by him. Bret Harte 's publisher, Carleton, had a ready-made arrangement with Sampson Low and Son in London , and so authorized publication of Harte's Condensed Novels was coordinated on both sides of the Atlantic (a move that did little to prevent unauthorized appropriation of this work and others by Harte ). Later, as the American editions of Harte 's works were handled by Fields, Osgood, then Osgood alone, and finally Houghton Mifflin, arrangements were made with Routledge and then Hotten's successor, Chatto and Windus, among others. Mark Twain too would prefer first Routledge and then Chatto and Windus after Hotten died in 1873. In an 1889 interview Andrew Chatto made it clear why the Americans were ill-disposed to Hotten but not to his successor. I was the assistant of J. C. Hotten , whose business I and Windus purchased from his widow for £25,000, and we are really the successors of Hotten, though we do not adhere to the policy of our predecessor. For instance, he believed that the best way to force on an international copyright with America was to plunder American authors. We do not. An American author can secure a copyright in England by publishing here first. By that means Bret Harte , Mark Twain , and others enjoy all the privileges of this market as well as their own. We have paid Mark Twain over £5,000 for royalties on his books. 14 American authors (and, intermittently, some publishers) long favored their nation's participation in an international agreement; decade after decade they advocated for this cause, but Washington did not alter its policy. The Round Table was particularly active in the cause. A thoughtful contribution to the discussion appeared in the issue of 16 December 1865; it was signed "C. L.," initials probably belonging to Charles Godfrey Leland , an author whose experience with piracy would be bracing. Leland was the creator of the popular " Hans Breitmann " ballads beginning in 1856. In 1868 he began to gather them in collections; his authorized American publisher was T. B. Peterson and Brothers and he consigned European rights to his friend Nicolas Trübner . The works were briskly pirated nonetheless in Canada , Australia , and also in England (by Hotten ). While his own losses to unauthorized publication were still a few years in the future, Leland was able nonetheless to call attention to an essential fact about international copyright. Influence in Washington on the copyright question rested with "less than half a dozen publishers, who have acquired wealth by reprinting foreign books"; the influence of this group (which at times included the Harpers) was undiminished by the protests of America's greatest authors, including Washington Irving , who, C. L. reveals, had recently visited the capital and 14 Joseph Hatton , "Pippins and Cheese; An After-Dinner Chat," Pick-Me-Up 2 (31 August 1889): 338 (repr. in Hatton's Cigarette Papers for After-Dinner Smoking, London : Hutchinson and Co., 1892, pp. 109-110). there witnessed "the intrigues of certain northern publishers against the rights of the very men they pretend to assist. ..." 15 The freedom from copyright restrictions asserted by American publishers in reprinting British books was one cause of the insecurity of authors' rights; another was Britain's policy of outlawing colonial publishing enterprises in its North American provinces. In mid-nineteenth-century America, the wants of the reading public were mainly satisfied with cheap unauthorized editions of British works. The popularity in America of the novels of Walter Scott and Charles Dickens was fostered and sustained to enormous proportions by these editions, a problem that Dickens publicly complained of early in his career, on his first visit to the New World. Because most American companies paid foreign authors little or nothing, their editions could be offered at prices that British publishers could not match. Anglophone Canadian readers were caught in a legal and economic vise, and starved for affordable books, especially in the years before and immediately after confederation (1867). Their booksellers were permitted to offer only the expensive English editions, which were made more expensive by high shipping costs. The importation of American reprints was prohibited and for a time Imperial agents vigilantly inspected bookseller-bound packages, destroying all contraband copies they found. Imperial law reserved the publishing business for the home country and forced on the colonies the status of a captive market. An astute observer reported that the scarcity of books in Canada inspired extraordinary remedial projects, including John Murray's 1840s series, the Home and Colonial Library. 16 He added, however, that this set "contained none of the new and fresh books which the colonists wanted." The observer was Samuel Edward Dawson (1833–1916), a Montréal publisher favored by American authors and well informed on the subject of copyright in the English-speaking world. The occasion for his observations was an 1882 lecture, published as Copyright in Books . It relates the history of copyright in England, America , and Canada as it operated through the nineteenth century, in the complex interactions of authors, publishers, and governments as they pursued their often competing interests. Dawson discusses the practical implications of the laws of the three governments during the decades of the 1860s and 1870s, and explains why American authors eventually found it almost impossible to prevent unauthorized publication of their works in Canada . By the Imperial Copyright Act of 1842, Imperial copyright was granted only to works that were published first within the British Isles —as opposed to British dominions, including the provinces that became Canada . A question lingered for some time as to whether authors needed also to be resident in Great Britain while their books were in press; a series of legal decisions, culminating in the final appeal in the case 15 [ Charles Godfrey Leland ], "The Laws of Copyright," Round Table new series i (16 December 1865): 233; see also, Leland , Memoirs ( New York : D. Appleton and Co., 1893), pp. 335–336; for the Harpers, see Exman, op. cit., ch. 5. 16 The Murray catalogue for February 1851, including a full inventory of the Home and Colonial Library, is printed as an advertisement in Charles Babbage, The Exposition of 1851, 2nd ed. ( London : John Murray , 1851). of Sampson Low against Routledge ( Routledge v. Low, 1868), endorsed the view that authors could secure Imperial copyright by residing "anywhere in the British dominions" while their works were in press in London . 17 That is, a visit only to the nearest colony was needed: American authors could stay in Canada while their books were being published in London . As one result of this decision, Dawson entertained a stream of visits to his Montréal home by prominent authors from the United States seeking to fulfill the stipulation; they included Oliver Wendell Holmes and eventually Mark Twain . Holmes made his visit in 1867 for his book The Guardian Angel, and the copyright he thereupon secured was defended successfully in London in 1868. 18 Wit and Humor was a portentous piracy: in appropriating the works of Mark Twain and Bret Harte even before the two authors had secured a national readership in their home country, the surreptitious volume set a precedent for the prodigious appropriations of the coming years. As Mark Twain's and Bret Harte's stars rose in the States, dozens of unauthorized editions of their works were produced in Canada . The copying began in earnest in 1870, with a ten-cent edition of Jumping Frog bearing the imprint of A. S. Irving , a Toronto news agent. It was a reprint of the Routledge edition of 1870; Gordon Roper has shown that the presswork for this volume was performed by the Daily Telegraph Printing House of Toronto, a company owned by John Ross Robertson and James B. Cook . The same year The Innocents Abroad also appeared with Irving's title-page imprint—as well as with the imprints of at least three other companies, including Dawson Brothers; Roper revealed that these were separate issues, all deriving from the same typesetting performed by the same printer responsible for the Irving Jumping Frog. As has already been mentioned, the Daily Telegraph Printing House is indirectly connected to J. R. Sutherland : Sutherland's partner, Henry N. McEvoy , is listed as working for this Robertson and Cook-owned company in 1869. The connection suggests (for now, no more than suggests) a possibility that Wit and Humor too was the work of this printing house. Like Mark Twain , Bret Harte encountered vigorous appropriation of his works in North America and England . Condensed Novels was brazenly pirated in New York in 1867; its next unauthorized publication was in 1871, a prodigious year for Harte piracies. Hotten led the way with four Harte volumes: Sensation Novels, Condensed; That Heathen Chinee and Other Poems; East and West (a copy of Osgood's authorized East and West Poems); and Lothaw ... by Mr. Benjamins ," a parody of Disraeli's novel Lothair that Harte made for the authorized Osgood edition of Condensed Novels. In Canada that year, the Canadian News and Publishing Company issued two volumes, Condensed Novels and Poems, while A. S. Irving brought out The Luck of Roaring Camp. The following year came more of the same, 17 Dawson , Copyright in Books, Montréal: Dawson Brothers, 1882, p. 20. Details in the remainder of this and the following paragraph are supported in Dawson , pp. 20—25; both articles by Gordon Roper (see note ii above); and Walter Arthur Copinger, The Law of Copyright in Works of Literature and Art, London : Stevens and Haynes, 1870, pp. 64–66, 236–237. 18 "Low v. Ward " (2 July 1868), in The Law Reports: Equity Cases before the Master of the Roles and the Vice-Chancellors, vol. VI, ed. G. W. Hemming , London : Printed for the Council of Law Reporting by William Clowes and Sons, pp. 415–418; "Law," The Bookseller: A Handbook of British and Foreign Literature, 1 August 1868, p. 524. with Ward, Lock and Tyler in London contesting Hotten for the role as the most prolific source of unauthorized Harte editions. 19 Mark Twain visited Montréal in 1881, determined to put a stop to the busy Canadian presses, which had without his agreement reproduced all his books and even compiled unique anthologies of his writings. He made an especially vigorous effort to secure both Imperial and Canadian copyright for a new book, The Prince and the Pauper. Dawson , the publisher of the authorized Canadian edition of this work, explained that Mark Twain achieved his first object but failed in achieving the second, because of a change in Canadian law since the time when Holmes won his case. The Canadian Act of 1875 was carefully designed to support Canadian publishing and authorship and granted local copyright only to authors domiciled (as opposed to "residing") in Canada . Dawson 's authorized Canadian edition did preclude other Canadian publishers from printing the work within Canada , but not from employing a printer across the border and importing the result (subject to payment of a duty of 12–1/2 percent). This gap in the intersecting laws was soon exploited. As with earlier works such as Tom Sawyer and A Tramp Abroad, and Harte's Gabriel Conway, a pirated edition of The Prince and the Pauper was issued in Toronto within weeks of the appearance of the first American edition. On the title page was the imprint of the Rose-Belford Publishing Company, a particularly active combination of two of the publishers identified by Gordon Roper ; not to be denied, a third publisher, John Ross Robertson , soon followed with a fugitive edition of his own. 20 Certain of Robertson's publications from the early 1880s well illustrate Mark Twain 's failure to secure Canadian copyright: the publisher brought out many editions of the works of Bret Harte and Mark Twain during this time, some of which he included in "Robertson's Cheap Series," at prices of thirty cents or less. These editions and others like them remained legally incontestable. In 1866 the Sutherland company (or Robertson and Cook's printing house) could not have been constrained from printing Wit and Humor in Canada , but sales in the United States might have been stopped by an injured copyright holder. No record of any action pertaining to the book has been discovered, however. 19 Roper 1966, op. cit., pp. 32—35. The sequence of Harte piracies is partly revealed in the sale catalogue for the collections of a pioneering Harte scholar: see The Charles Meeker Kozlay Collection of Bret Harte . ... To be sold on Thursday afternoon and evening, March 18,1926 ( New York : American Art Association), especially lots 13, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 47–49, 53, 54 64–70, 81, 82, 84, 85, 91, 99; Hotten's Sensation Novels, Condensed, was reissued with a new title page as part of "Beeton's Humorous Books," a large series by Ward, Lock and Tyler , a London house that made many unauthorized editions of the works of American authors (see lot 111 in the Kozlay catalogue and Brander Matthews , "American Authors and British Pirates," New Princeton Review 4 [September 1887]: 206). 20 Mark Twain was undeterred in his pursuit of Canadian copyright, despite the experience of The Prince and the Pauper. In a notebook entry made in January 1888, he recognized the obsolescence of the example of Oliver Wendell Holmes and The Guardian Angel: "always do P P &amp; never go to Canada . Dr Holmes was the last to go to Can to get Eng cop—1867. ‘Guardian Angel'" ( Notebooks &amp; Journals, Volume III, op. cit., p. 363). By "P P" previous publication is meant. By this time he had achieved Canadian copyright, with Life on the Mississippi (1883) and Huckleberry Finn (1884–85), through the combined efforts of Dawson , who published these works, and Andrew Chatto , who as a British subject applied for the Canadian copyrights (see Roper 1960, op. cit., pp. 26–27). III Given that earlier and later versions of the advertisement for Wit and Humor appeared on the same date, 14 March 1866, they suggest that the volume was already printed by then. Like other early unauthorized printings it would have helped Mark Twain 's reputation if not his pocketbook. The very early use of his name to attract sales is noteworthy in itself. Of the authors named as contributors only Mark Twain would become a creator of enduring literature; the works of the others, with the exception of some of Bret Harte's stories, have mostly been forgotten. Yet in the spring of 1866 Mark Twain 's claim to a place in the advertisement would seem to have been the least explicable. The limit of his celebrity is indicated by the persistent misprint, "Mark Train," appearing in all the Wit and Humor advertisements in the New York Times and Boston Evening Transcript (the name "McArone" was also misspelled in this least carefully composed version). His brief burlesques and sketches written for the Californian had not yet "appeared ‘between covers,'" as an alert critic observed in the Round Table in September 1865. 21 Neither had they been much reprinted in the East—the critic must have seen the Californian itself. The Golden Era, San Francisco's first literary journal and the widest-circulating newspaper in the West, was also available in New York ; its editor Joseph Lawrence (1824–78) was, like Webb, a New York transplant with connections in the East. Mark Twain wrote little for the Golden Era, however, and only in November 1865 would that paper begin to reprint his writings in quantity (when Lawrence replayed for San Francisco readers substantial excerpts from Mark Twain 's correspondence about their city to the Virginia City, Nevada, Territorial Enterprise ). Webb almost certainly supplied Californihi subscriptions to a number of New York papers, including the Round Table. The editors of these papers and many of their contributors were known to him; the Round Table was even adopted by Webb as the model for the design and layout of the Californian (he eschewed the Round Table' s haughty editorial tone). When Wit and Humor was advertised, six months after the Round Table review cited above, Mark Twain 's name was better known, for reasons explained by a correspondent of the San Francisco Alta California: " Mark Twain 's story in the Saturday Press of November 18, called ‘ Jim Smiley and his Jumping Frog,' has set all New York in a roar, and he may be said to have made his mark. I have been asked fifty times about it and its author, and the papers are copying it far and near." 22 The history of the tale that gave Mark Twain an Eastern reputation has been masterfully reconstructed by Robert Hirst and Edgar Branch . 23 A few details remain elusive. When he completed the story in San Francisco in mid- October 1865, Mark Twain sent the manuscript to New York , either to Artemus Ward or directly to Artemus 's publisher, George Carleton . The story begins, 21 "American Humor and Humorists," Round Table new series 1 (9 September 1865): 2. 22 "Podgers' Letter from New York ," dated 10 December 1865, San Francisco Alta California , 10 January 1866, p. i; the correspondent, Richard L. Ogden , had been an investor in the Californian . 23 See Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 2: 1864 — 1865, ed. Edgar Marquess Branch and Robert H. Hirst , The Works of Mark Twain (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1981), pp. 262–272. " Mr. A. Ward , | Dear Sir," and was meant as a long-delayed answer to a request by Artemus for a contribution to his second book, in which the traveling funny man would recount his Western adventures. Mark Twain 's receipt of this request had been long delayed, since it likely arrived in San Francisco just after he had quietly removed from the city for the winter, to the mining country of Tuolumne and Calaveras counties. He returned to town at the end of February 1865 with little money but potential literary treasure, to be converted from experiences of tale-telling in the mining camps. He seems to have written to Artemus that he had a theme in mind for a contribution, but that it was probably too late to work it up; he later recalled that Artemus again urged him to write something. 24 A further delay, however, did keep him from contributing; its causes were both literary and psychological. As he struggled to find the right mining country tale to retell, and the right way to retell it, he simultaneously experienced an acute crisis of consciousness, partly brought on by poverty, in which he thought of taking his own life. He was not yet thirty. At the apogee of his mental turbulence, perhaps between 16 and 18 October 1865, he wrote what for a long time was regarded as the funniest story in all American literature. Carleton received the manuscript in New York just as Artemus Ward: His Travels, was advertised for sale. Unable to include it in a book that was already printed and bound, Carleton passed it on to Henry Clapp, Jr ., editor of the New York Saturday Press. The choice was wise and logical. Clapp (181g-75), the man who was ultimately instrumental in revealing Mark Twain to Eastern readers, was an unusual figure on the American cultural scene. A Nantucketer by birth and a descendant of the Coffins, he was a campaigner in the New England reform movement in the 1840s. As editor of a temperance and anti-slavery paper in Lynn , Massachusetts, he spent 60 days in jail after criticizing the legal system as prejudiced against the poor. When he was released, his friends sent him to Europe , where he stayed a year, attending the World's Temperance Convention in London with Lyman Beecher . He returned to Europe in 1848, and passed the next six years in England, Belgium , and France . In Paris he lived at the Hotel de Corneille at the center of the Bohemian life contemporaneously described by Henri Murger . Amidst revolutionary events, he deepened his radical views, especially studying the works of Charles Fourier . He also abandoned the cause (and practice) of temperance. On his return he settled in New York where he gathered around him like-thinking men and women; they advocated socialism, communal living, and free love (that is, the separation of human intimacy from ecclesiastical or state control). With Albert Brisbane he made reliable English translations of some of Fourier's works, and helped Horace Greeley and others better understand the philosophy that was intermittently espoused in the New York Tribune. Clapp remained a busy editor and columnist the while. He edited and wrote for the Leader, and in 1858 founded his own journal, a weekly review of the arts called the Saturday Press. In form and tone he followed models, especially the feuilleton, encountered during his residence in 24 This recollection is recorded in Albert Bigelow Paine , Mark Twain : A Biography ( New York : Harper and Brothers, 1912), 1:277; it is evaluated in Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 2, op. cit., 264—265, 265 n. 7. Paris . His paper failed on the eve of war's outbreak, at which point he devoted more attention to Vanity Fair, New York's illustrated humor magazine. Founded in 1860, it was modeled closely on Punch. Clapp provided the artistic inspiration, and even chose its name, doubtless a reflection of his following, possibly in situ, Thackeray's serial story, issued in parts by Bradbury and Evans, publishers of Punch, in 1847 and 1848. For both the Saturday Press and Vanity Fair, the men and women of Clapp's circle supplied most of the prose, poems, and pictures. These New York writers and artists came also to be called the Bohemians: they were serious about literature and art, but recoiled from the bourgeois respectability that they believed had overgrown and strangled the Boston cultural model. 25 They were known to gather of evenings at Charles Pfaff's restaurant and saloon at 647 Broadway, just above Bleecker St. The location was then convenient to the theaters, where many worked, a few as players (such as Adah Isaacs Menken ), many as critics. 26 Clapp revived his Saturday Press at war's end, in a different format, offering sixteen tabloid pages, rather than the original four pages of broadsheet. There seemed to be a bit more advertising at first, but the paper eventually shrank to eight pages, and despite Clapp's struggles to keep it alive, it failed in June of 1866. In its brief and interrupted run, however, the Saturday Press came to be regarded as the only literary periodical on the national scene to rival the Atlantic for artistic quality—if not for what was later called "brownstone respectability." It struck a more realistic tone, and was demonstratively frank about the human condition, especially the universal needs for humor and love. These were the few attributes 25 These few details of Henry Clapp's life and associations have been brought together from primary sources, including Clapp's own writings in the Leader and the Saturday Press; his books, The Pioneer; or Leaves from an Editor's Portfolio ( Lynn , Mass.: J. B. Tolman , 1846), and Husband vs. Wife ( New York : Rudd and Carleton, 1858); and his translations of some of Fourier's works. Also consulted were Clapp family records in the Nantucket Historical Society (with the help of Elizabeth Oldham ), proceedings of the temperance and peace conferences Clapp attended in Europe , newspaper obituaries, and the published testimony of his friends, including William Winter 's Old Friends: Being Literary Recollections of Other Days ( New York : Moffat , Yard, 1909) and Horace Traubel 's multi-volume chronicle, With Walt Whitman in Camden. Several Bohemians who adopted conventionally respectable persons in the post-bellum era, especially Howells and Edmund Clarence Stedman , left interesting recollections of their former lives and those of their associates, Henry Clapp included (for Howells , see his Literary Friends and Acquaintance; Stedman's contributions are scattered throughout the posthumous collection, Life and Letters of Edmund Clarence Stedman , cited in note 56 below). An excellent work of scholarship on Henry Clapp and the Bohemians, sometimes overlooked by literary investigators because of its theatrical perspective, is Tice L. Miller's Bohemians and Critics: American Theatre Criticism in the Nineteenth Century (Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1981). 26 German immigrant Charles Pfaff ran a "modest Restaurant and Lager Beer Saloon" originally situated at 647 Broadway ("Pfaff's" and "Go to Pfaff's!" Saturday Press 2 [3 March 1860]: pp. [2] and [3]; Trow's New York City Directory for the Year Ending May 1, 1861, H. Wilson, comp. [ New York : John F. Trow , 1860], p. 679). By 1865 the advertised address was 653 Broadway (three doors further north); the change of address is confirmed in many "puff" paragraphs and advertisements for Pfaff's that appeared in the original and revived Saturday Press —publicity that Henry Clapp freely gave, in appreciation of Charles Pfaff's generosity in supplying him and other poor and hungry Bohemians food and drink over the years (e.g., "Pfaff's!! Pfaff's!!" Saturday Press 4 [12 August 1865]: 31; a similar advertisement for Pfaff's can be seen in the column adjacent to the advertisements for Wit and Humor, in the issues of 17, 24, and 31 March 1866). which to Clapp's mind comprised the soul of the Bohemian attitude as he found it in the Latin Quarter, and he did much to encourage them among his associates on Broadway . Clapp's friend, the sometimes friendless Walt Whitman , was a contributor to the Saturday Press; so was the youthful William Dean Howells . Others included Fitz-James O'Brien , Thomas Bailey Aldrich , Fitz Hugh Ludlow , George Arnold , William Winter , and especially Ada Clare ( Jane McElhenney , 1836—1874), with whom Clapp formed a close bond. They were the authors of the best writing in the pages of New York 's journals and newspapers, and some were or would become Carleton authors. In an editorial paragraph in the issue of 18 November, Clapp introduced Saturday Press readers not only to Mark Twain but also to Josh Billings, another comedian of modest reputation soon to become nationally known. Clapp seemed to foresee Mark Twain 's approaching preeminence, remarking enigmatically that he "will shortly become a regular contributor to our columns," and "his articles have been so extensively copied as to make him nearly as well known as Artemus Ward." 27 These statements seem uncannily to refer to the future, rather than the present. At the time they were uttered, Mark Twain's articles had not yet been much copied in the East, and, as far as is known, he had not yet arranged to become a contributor to the Saturday Press. Clapp may have been prompted to take Mark Twain's story by an intermediate relation, such as Artemus Ward or Charles Henry Webb. Artemus's intimacy with Henry Clapp dated from the fall of 1860, when he was lured from the Cleveland Plain Dealer to write and edit for Vanity Fair. In 1863, the year that Vanity Fair expired, Artemus and Webb separately went West, beginning a wartime trend by which many of the Bohemians met Bret Harte and Mark Twain for the first time. Mark Twain became fast friends with Artemus Ward when the famous comedian arrived in Nevada in December 1863. Artemus was so taken with the personality and writings of the local reporter for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise that he proposed that they return to New York together for lecturing and further travel. Mark Twain , then unknown to a public beyond the Nevada Territory, declined this extraordinary invitation. At Artemus's urging he did agree to contribute to the New York Sunday Mercury, a widely circulating cultural paper where Artemus's writings had been appearing since the failure of Vanity Fair . 28 The ex-editor of the Mercury, Robert Henry Newell (1836–1901), was one of several of Artemus's friends connected with that paper. Newell was author of the Mercury's "Orpheus C. Kerr Papers"; he arrived in Virginia City not long after Artemus departed. He was then in the tow of Mrs. Newell , the actress Adah Isaacs Menken , who would soon become his ex-wife. Like Artemus, 27 Saturday Press 4 (18 November 1865): 248 (eighth of sixteen pages); "Sayings of Josh Billings ," written "For the Saturday Press," began on p. 242. 28 George P. Rowell's American Newspaper Directory, ed. George P. Rowell ( New York : George P. Rowell and Co., 1869) records a circulation of 65,000 for the New York Sunday Mercury, likely for 1867 (p. 177). For Mark Twain's first encounter with Artemus Ward, see his letter to Jane Lampton Clemens , 2? January 1864, in Mark Twain's Letters, Volume 1: 1853 –1866 ( Berkeley : Univ. of California Press, 1987), pp. 267–270, especially 269–270 n. 5; an informative article on the life of Charles Farrar Browne is "Obituary," American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular 7 (15 March 1867): 292. the Newell s were both veterans of Clapp's table at Pfaff's. Mark Twain had already reviewed earlier performances of "The Menken " in San Francisco ; when the couple came to Nevada he may have discussed Artemus's proposal with Newell . Perhaps unprepared psychologically to enter on a national literary stage, Mark Twain did not press this opportunity, and managed to send only two pieces to the Mercury . 29 After these pieces appeared in the winter of 1864, the New York press saw little of Mark Twain until after he had moved to San Francisco . Then in August 1865 a prose prologue and poem written in dialect called "He Done His Level Best" was reprinted in the Leader. This was the paper Clapp edited before recommencing the Saturday Press (where the poem alone was again reprinted, in September). The text was taken from "Answers to Correspondents," a column Mark Twain conducted in the Californian in June and July, and so Charles Henry Webb might just as easily have acted as liaison between the author and Henry Clapp. Webb had been the first of the Bohemians to arrive in the West, and the first to befriend Mark Twain . He thought even more highly of Mark Twain's talents than did Artemus, as evidenced by a comparison he made in early November. Responding as " John Paul " in the Sacramento Union to the Round Table's recent recognition of Mark Twain (quoted above), Webb wrote: "To my thinking Shakspeare had no more idea that he was writing for posterity than Mark Twain has at the present time, and it sometimes amuses me to think how future Mark Twain scholars will puzzle over that gentleman's present hieroglyphics and occasionally eccentric expressions." 30 Almost certainly Webb did not regard the comparison as hyperbolic. Part of what prompted it was a Shakespearean dimension in Mark Twain's art, today associated with his maturity, that was already present in his early writing. A realistic representation of regional speech stood out in both "He Done His Level Best" and the jumping frog story (which Webb probably first heard, as did Bret Harte , in dramatic narration by the author). As presented, prologue and poem were brief snippets from Mark Twain's ongoing experimentation with the " Pike county " dialects of his youth, which he heard again in the emigrant voices of 29 Newell was said to have left the Sunday Mercury before heading west (see under Newell in National Cyclopedia of American Biography, vol. II, New York : James T. White and Co., 1905); he likely had a role in securing Artemus's Mercury contributions, however, and could have helped Mark Twain as well. Mark Twain's two Mercury pieces were "Doings in Nevada " and "Those Blasted Children," which appeared respectively in the issues of 7 and 21 February 1864. By separate arrangement, he made further contributions in 1867. Fellow Territorial Enterprise reporter William Wright ( Dan De Quille ) left a memoir of a soirée arranged by "The Menken" in her Virginia City hotel room, attended by Wright , Ada Clare , and Mark Twain ; according to Wright , Menken did not invite Newell , who paced the floor outside. Mark Twain is said to have made a poor impression, by accidentally kicking his hostess in a failed attempt to kick her dog ( William Wright , "Salad Days of Mark Twain ," San Francisco Examiner, 19 March 1893, 13–14). If Wright's recollection is accurate, the events of the evening could conceivably have affected Mark Twain's relationship with the Sunday Mercury. 30 John Paul , "Letter from San Francisco ," dated 1 November, Sacramento Union, 3 November 1865, p. 2. the mining camps and restaurants of Nevada and California . 31 The purported poet (named only in the original piece, not the reprinted extracts) was " Simon Wheeler ," a persona based on Ben Coon, an Angels Camp bartender and former Illinois steamboat pilot who was likely the narrator of the jumping frog story as Mark Twain first heard it. The authentic sound of the re-creation, pitched in these items for an absent-minded and humorless elder storyteller, proved irresistibly attractive to Eastern readers. Especially impressed were the literary-minded, not least because the vernacular narrative did not rely on the overused device of bad spelling. Mark Twain also experimented at this time with the youthful pitch of this dialect. Elaborated, this version would bring its author immortality; it is heard for the first time, as far as is known, in the voice of a boy in " Fitz Smythe's Horse " (published in the Territorial Enterprise in January 1866). Like the jumping frog story and the poem, this piece also attracted Eastern attention, when it was included in Beadle's Dime Book of Fun. The advocacy of Artemus Ward and Charles Henry Webb for the little known comedian bordered on the passionate, and Mark Twain might thereby have been confident of his chances of attaining a measure of success in the East. Until the jumping frog sketch was printed and had met with national approval, however, the author struggled with debt and depression. The Wit and Humor advertisements are evidence that his Eastern repute, which helped him eventually regain his composure, did not ebb, though he left San Francisco at this time, for Hawaii. The number and selection of items contained in Wit and Humor have not been discovered. For Mark Twain , it is hard to imagine that the collection did not include the jumping frog tale; other likely selections of his work would have been writings that appeared early enough in the Eastern press, whether in the form of reprints from the Western press or original contributions. They were few in number and were concentrated in three papers associated with Bohemian New York . "The Story of the Bad Little Boy" was reprinted in the Leader (20 February 1866), and the Saturday Press reprinted "The Ballad Infliction" (9 December 1865), "The Pioneer Ball" (23 December), and "' Mark Twain ' on the Launch of the Steamer ‘Capital'" (30 December). All the pieces were probably copied from the Californian : the earliest and latest of the four were written for that paper and the middle 31 The travel writer Bayard Taylor , who visited California in 1849 and again in 1859, offered a cultivated Easterner's view of the emigrant "Pikes," whom Mark Twain would portray with affection: A "Pike," in the California dialect, is a native of Missouri , Arkansas , Northern Texas, or Southern Illinois. The first emigrants that came over the plains were from Pike county , Missouri . ... He is the Anglo-Saxon relapsed into semi-barbarism. He is long, lathy, and sallow; he expectorates vehemently; he takes naturally to whisky; he has the "shakes" his life long at home, though he generally manages to get rid of them in California ; he has little respect for the rights of others; he distrusts men in "store clothes," but venerates the memory of Andrew Jackson ; finally, he has an implacable dislike to trees. Girdling is his favorite mode of exterminating them; but he sometimes contents himself with cutting off the largest and handsomest limbs. When he spares one, for the sake of a little shade near his house, he whitewashes the trunk. (At Home and Abroad: A Sketch-Book of Life, Scenery and Men, second series, New York : G. P. Putnam , 1862, p. 51) two were reprinted there, from the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. Besides ‘Jumping Frog," Clapp printed one original sketch of Mark Twain's , "The Mysterious Bottle of Whiskey" (3 March). Finally, Mark Twain contributed three original sketches to the New York Weekly Review: "The Great Earthquake in San Francisco " (25 November 1865), "The Christmas Fireside" (3 February 1866), and "An Open Letter to the American People" (17 February). Almost nothing is known about his arrangement with the Weekly Review, though probably germane is that in 1865 Henry Clapp, who may have quarreled with the editor of the Leader, temporarily transferred his pen to the Weekly Review, where he joined his friend, co-editor Charles B. Seymour , who was also dramatic critic for the New York Times and would write for the revived Saturday Press . 32 The influence wielded by the small Bohemian weeklies—an influence that more than any other elevated the names of Bret Harte and Mark Twain to national prominence—was partly due to the fact that their columns were mined for content by other periodicals of much larger circulation. "The Mysterious Bottle of Whiskey," for example, was taken from the Saturday Press for the May 1866 issue of Ballou's Monthly Magazine, the self-proclaimed "cheapest magazine in the world." Ballou's was brought out in Boston by the publisher of the weekly Flag of Our Union; the reprinting put Mark Twain's name before 75,000 readers. 33 The prominence given to Bret Harte in the Wit and Humor advertisements attests to his leading position among Western writers and especially to the popularity of his "Condensed Novels." "[T]he instinct of parody" Harte recalled in a later year, "has always possessed me." 34 Certainly in his early literary life he found the form irresistible, and adopted it often whether in prose or in poetry. His unfortunately misunderstood satire of 1870, "Plain Language from Truthful James " (notorious as the "Heathen Chinee"), was a kind of parody, in that according to Harte he followed carefully meter he found in Swinburne's Atalanta in Calydon (1865). Harte came out as a parodist in 1861, at the age of twenty-four, writing "Mysteries of the Two Metropolises" as " J. Keyser " for the Golden Era. He followed this treatment of Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities with efforts after works by Hugo and Michelet , which appeared in 1862. Transferring his pen to the newly founded Californian in 1864, he conducted a series of poetic parodies called " San Francisco , by the Poets," treating of Spenser , Gray, Poe, Scott, and Tennyson. 35 In 1865 he resumed his burlesques of prose writers, dubbing them "Condensed Novels"; thirteen appeared in the Californian in 1865. They were 32 Seymour's co-editor at the Weekly Review was Theodore Hagen , founder of the paper; see under Seymour in Cyclopedia of American Biography, new and enlarged edition of Appleton's Cyclopedia ..., vol. 5 ( New York : Press Association Compilers, Inc., 1915). 33 Ballou's Monthly Magazine 23 (May 1866): 418 (see also p. 420); the circulation of Ballou's, probably for 1867, is given in George P. Rowell's American Newspaper Directory (1869, op. cit.), p. 177. 34 Henry J. W. Dam , "A Morning with Bret Harte ," McClure's Magazine 4 (December 1894): 43. 35 Harte never completely collected his early poetic parodies, though "The Willows" (after Poe's "Ulalume") and a few others were reprinted in The Lost Galleon and also Poems ( Boston : James R . Osgood and Co., 1871). There is evidence that he once intended to do more with them: some installments of " San Francisco , by the Poets" are scissored out of a bound volume of the Californian that he owned, which survives in the San Francisco Public Library. Harte revealed the connection between his first "Truthful James" poem and Swinburne's Greek-themed verse tragedy in the interview cited in the previous note. not written in a "Western" style, but rather followed the stylistic cues of their English, French, and American subjects. Absent too were the Western vernacular themes on which the enduring artistic value of Harte's Overland Monthly stories has depended, though the author did include some inside references to rural and metropolitan California . The "Condensed Novels" drew readers from a bookish public, first in San Francisco , but soon in the East as well. The pieces reappeared in the Leader and the Saturday Press, suggesting again the possibility of Webb's intervention, though Harte himself, as intermittent editor of the Californian, may also have been in contact with Henry Clapp . The Leader reprinted five "Condensed Novels": "Myself" (originally "Me"), after Bulwer-Lytton's My Novel (12 August 1865); " Terence Deuville ," after Charles Lever's Charles O'Malley, the Irish Dragoon (19 August); "The Ninety-nine Guardsmen," after the Dumas novels translated as The Three Guardsmen and The Forty-five Guardsmen (2 September); " Selina Sedilia ," after the works of Maria Elizabeth Braddon and Mrs. Henry Wood ( Ellen Price ), including, by the former, The Trail of the Serpent (16 September); and "Guy Heavystone," after Guy Livingstone by George Alfred Lawrence (25 November). The Saturday Press also reprinted five items: "Muck-a-muck," after Cooper's "Leatherstocking" novels (28 October 1865); "Fantine," after the discretely published part of Hugo's Les Misérables (9 December); " Mr. Midshipman Breezy ," after Frederick Marryat's Mr Midshipman Easy (30 December); "Miss Mix," after Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (20 January 1866); and "The Haunted Man," following the Dickens story of that name and "A Christmas Carol" (10 February). 36 Ten of a total of fifteen parodies thus found an Eastern audience. Harte knew of his rising Eastern popularity as early as 8 January 1866, when he wrote to Outcroppings publisher Anton Roman , "I have some idea of publishing a little book of my California sketches and burlesques including the 'Condensed Novels,' which have been widely copied and seem to be popular in the East. Let me know what you think of it. Of course, I should depend entirely upon its sale in the East." 37 In "The Haunted Man," a late "Condensed Novel," the protagonist is tormented by novelistic formulæ and an itinerary of scenes from the works of Dickens and his imitators and rivals. There too are sketched scenes from Hawthorne , Scott , and Thackeray , authors otherwise untreated in the "Condensed Novels" 36. The dates of the New York reprints are given here; the original publication dates can be found in George Stewart , "A Bibliography of the Writings of Bret Harte in the Magazines and Newspapers of California , 1857–1871," University of California Publications in English 3 (1933): 134, 135, 149–151, and in Bret Harte : A Bibliography, op. cit., pp. 81, 83, 92–96. All the Californian "Condensed Novels" were first published in the summer and fall of 1865 (including the revised "Fantine" after Hugo , reprinted from the Golden Era); all appeared in volume 3 of the Californian, except the final effort, " Mr. Midshipman Breezy ," which appeared in volume 4. While Clapp and the other Bohemian editors preferred the "Condensed Novels," they reprinted other Harte items from the Californian, including, in the Leader, "Stories for Little Girls" (9 September 1865) and "The Lament of the Ballad-Writer " (18 November), and, in the Saturday Press, "A Venerable Imposter" (3 February 1866), a story Harte included in Condensed Novels and Other Papers. 37. The Letters of Bret Harte , op. cit., p. 4; see also note 2 above. (though Thackeray is present in them in another sense). Harte did choose a few authors of like stature as objects for his parodies— Dickens, Brontë, Hugo, Collins —but in the main treated of little-remembered sentimental and gothic productions. While many of these were popular in the 1860s, some of the references may have been obscure even to Harte's contemporaries. 38 Motive for a few selections may have come from the columns of the Golden Era, which had begun serialized publication of Mary Elizabeth Braddon's The Trail of the Serpent in December 1863. The merits and faults of her literature and that of her competitors, including Mrs. Henry Wood , were also ably assessed there, by a recent product of Bohemia's westward exodus . Ada Clare , the "Queen of Bohemia," landed in San Francisco in March 1864 and took her place among the Golden Era writers, in all likelihood by advance arrangement with Joseph Lawrence . She and her son Aubrey had barely settled into their quarters in the Russ House before the first installment of "Ada Clare" appeared. With this column came more than a whiff of Pfaffian iconoclasm to upstart San Francisco , though thereby masked were neither the author's magnetic good nature nor her vulnerability to the prejudice she encountered as a husbandless mother. Her commentaries on literature, drama, and society were unusually learned and professional for San Francisco then and would not have escaped Harte's attention. Of particular relevance to his "Condensed Novels" would have been the informed assessments of popular literature, including passages in which Braddon and Wood were discussed as rivals. She and Harte never became friends exactly, but Ada Clare may have helped firm his grasp of popular literature; after returning to New York she expressed admiration for the "Condensed Novels" in her column in the Weekly Review. 39 From a distance of nearly 150 years Harte's choices for his "Condensed Novels" seem logical, and judiciously representative of the popular literature of that time. While this appearance is not at all false, the sources from which the choices were drawn can be brought into closer focus: all the novels and romances Harte chose to burlesque were available to him in the collections of the Mercantile Library of San Francisco ; all but a few were published by T. B. Peterson and Brothers of Philadelphia. In his writings from the 1860s, Harte attested both to 38. Retrospectives on literary popularity and taste are uncertain; illustrative in this connection is T. Edgar Pemberton's observations on the "Condensed Novels," made in 1900. Speaking of the authors whom Harte imitated, Pemberton remarked that Cooper, Marryat, Bulwer-Lytton , and Charles Reade were "not much read today," while "Miss Braddon" and " Mrs Henry Wood " were among those who were "always with us" ( Bret Harte: A Treatise and a Tribute [ London : Greening and Co.], p. 85). Confirmation of the contemporary popularity of even those works treated in the "Condensed Novels" that are most obscure today can be found in James D. Hart's classic study, The Popular Book: A History of America's Literary Taste (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1950). 39. See "Ada Clare," Golden Era 12 (15 May 1864): 4; Ada Clare commenced discussing the "Sensation Stories" of Braddon, Wood, T. S. Arthur and others in her very first column, "Ada Clare," Golden Era 12 (20 March 1864): 4–5. Some details of Jane McElhenney's biography may be found in the recollections of two friends, William Winter , Brief Chronicles ( New York : Dunlap Society, 1889), pp. 48–49, and Charles Warren Stoddard , " Ada Clare , Queen of Bohemia , National Magazine 22 (September 1905): 637–645. Ada Clare mentioned her public praise of the "Condensed Novels" in her letter to Stoddard of 14 September 1865 (reproduced in Stoddard's article). his familiarity with Peterson's publications and to his regular use of the Mercantile Library, which then had the city's largest publicly available collection of books and journals. In "Among the Books" he reported on the library for the Californian (without using its name); he noted how keenly the clientele awaited the arrival of new books and journals. Sentimental novels were "bespoken some weeks ahead" by "young ladies with pale blue eyes," who were wont lightly to underline such passages as "Mary did not answer but pressed her hand convulsively to her heart. ..." He also gave an idea of his own reading habits when he complained of hogs who sat (literally) on the latest issues of Punch and the Saturday Review while perusing the latest issue of the Illustrated London News. In "Railway Reading," also written for the Californian, he referred pointedly to formulaic moralizing in the work of Peterson author Timothy Shay Arthur and in the stories published in Peterson's Magazine. 40 The Mercantile Library's collection no longer exists, but its contents in the 1860s can be partly reconstructed from surviving records. A few months before the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906, the Mercantile Library had formally merged with the Mechanics' Institute. The collections were still housed separately, and totaled two hundred thousand volumes. Apart from the library of Adolph Sutro, which was not yet available for public use, the merged libraries would have been the largest in San Francisco and in California . The Sutro library was partly destroyed in the calamity (another large private library, that of H. H. Bancroft , escaped the destruction). The fire found both the Mechanics' Institute Library at 31 Post Street and the Mercantile Library, then in temporary storage at 228 Sutter Street. 41 Both collections were completely consumed. Fortunately printed catalogues of the Mercantile Library have survived, including those compiled in 1861 and 1874. 42 The 1861 catalogue lists some fourteen thousand volumes. One entry, Punch's Prize Novelists by Thackeray, suggests Harte's inspiration for the "Condensed Novels," as they very much followed the pattern and style of these satires. They were made for Punch in 1847 and some were collected in an edition by D. Appleton ( New York , 1853), likely the one owned by the Mercantile Library. Thackeray's subjects included Bulwer-Lytton , 40. "Among the Books," Californian 3 (30 September 1865): 8; "Railway Reading," Californian 5 (9 June 1866): 9. 41.

Bancroft's collection, then reportedly of fifty thousand books and manuscripts, awaited shipment to its new owner, the University of California , at a location five blocks beyond the zone of destruction, at 1538 Valencia Street. Most of nMark Twain's writing for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise was also lost, when the fire destroyed the last two substantially complete files of that paper that included the issues from before mid-1866, which were housed in the Merchants' Exchange and the San Francisco Public Library (other Enterprise files had been destroyed in an 1875 Virginia City fire). 42. A Classified Catalogue of the Mercantile Library of San Francisco ... Consisting of About Fourteen Thousand Volumes, [ Horace H. Moore ], comp. ( San Francisco : Mercantile Library Association, 1861); Catalogue of the Library of the Mercantile Library Association of San Francisco ( San Francisco : [Mercantile Library Association], 1874). The 1874 catalogue was the third (the first was compiled in 1854); it recorded the state of the library as of 1 February 1874, when it contained over thirty-six thousand volumes (p. v). Charles Lever , and Cooper , authors at which Harte did not himself resist taking further aim. 43 The 1861 Mercantile Library catalogue does not offer publication information, but the section "Novels and Romances" contains scores of titles that were available through T. B. Peterson and many that were uniquely available from that publisher. The company was founded in 1845 by Theophilus B. Peterson (1823–90). His older brother was Charles J. Peterson , the well-known editor of the Saturday Evening Post, Graham's Magazine, and eventually Peterson's Magazine, which Theophilus would publish. Theophilus later brought his two younger brothers into the firm and for forty-five years pursued energetically a business model indicated in the following lines from his obituary: "His first book was published in 1846, being a reprint of [ Charlotte Campbell Bury's ] popular 'sensational' novel, [The Disinherited and the Ensnared]. The price of the London edition was $7.50; the price of Peterson's edition was twenty-five cents." 44 In the 1850s and 1860s, Peterson offered entire sets of works by English and French authors, who received no compensation (with the notable exception of Dickens); hundreds of commissioned American titles were also offered. Prices were extremely low and libraries and book dealers were the firm's target customers. 45 By 1865 the 43. Appleton's 1853 edition of Punch's Prize Novelists did not, however, include Thackeray's treatments of Charles Lever or Cooper . The library also possessed these works, in their original form, as its collections included a complete run of Punch. A more complete edition of Thackeray's condensed novels eventually appeared as Novels by Eminent Hands. For the Thackeray edition of T. Y. Crowell and Co. ( London , 1904), John Bell Henneman prepared a bibliographic inventory of the satires, which was reprinted the following year in the introduction to Novels by Eminent Hands, in The Complete Works of William Makepeace Thackeray , vol. 15 ( New York : Riverdale Press, 1905), p. vi. As Henneman pointed out, Thackeray's "George de Barnwell, by Sir E. L., B. L. ," etc., is aimed at the works of Bulwer-Lytton ; "Phil Fogarty. A tale of the Fighting Onety Oneth. By Harry Rollicker" is a treatment of Charles Lever's Charles O'Malley , the Irish Dragoon , with a reference to Lever's Confessions of Harry Lorrequer ; and "The Stars and Stripes. By the Author of 'The Last of the Mulligans,' 'The Pilot,' Etc.," obviously refers to Cooper . A critical edition of the satires, along with a discussion of textual history, are offered in The Snobs of England and Punch's Prize Novelists, ed. Edgar F. Harden, The Works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Peter L. Shillingsburg, general editor (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 2005). 44. "A Veteran Publisher," Newsman 8 (January 1891): 1; see also "Notes and Queries," Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 36 (January 1912): 117–119. A sketch of Peterson's Magazine appears in Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines, 1850–1865 ( Cambridge , Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1938), pp. 306–311. 45. Peterson was not wholly above taking liberties with American authors, as indicated by its 1865 republication of Herman Melville's Israel Potter, under the new title The Refugee and advertised (in the catalogue cited in note 8) at $1.50 in paper and $2.00 in cloth. Melville was not informed of the new edition, did not approve the new title, and was paid nothing. Yet Peterson acquired the rights of the novel legally, as it did, apparently, all the American works it published: see Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile, ed. Harrison Hayford , Hershel Parker , and G. Thomas Tanselle , with a historical note by Walter E. Bezanson , The Writings of Herman Melville ( Evanston and Chicago : Northwestern Univ. Press and Newberry Library, 1982), pp. 224–226. Dickens was perhaps the best treated British author in America , largely owing to his good relations with American publishers, which began with his 1842 visit to America ; as Eugene Exman discussed in his history of the Harpers, an informal agreement between the Harpers and Peterson for the publication of Dickens's works did return some money to the author (The House of Harper: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Publishing [ New York : Harper and Row] p. 56). Mercantile Library is known to have added thousands of volumes to its collections: a report in that year described "the largest institution of its kind" in San Francisco as containing "about thirty thousand volumes"; its membership and collections were growing to an extent that a new building was contemplated. 46 The "new accession" to which the report referred may have been furnished in part by responses to one of Peterson's many advertisements: We have just issued a new and complete Catalogue, as well as wholesale price Lists, which we send to Booksellers and Libraries on application.... Enclose five, ten, twenty, fifty or a hundred dollars, or more, to us in a letter, and write what kinds of books you wish, and they will be packed and sent to you at once, per first express or mail, or any way you may direct, with circulars, show bills, etc., gratis. 47 Most of the works Harte chose were already listed in the 1861 Mercantile Library catalogue; the exceptions were works published after that year, and all of these appear in the 1874 library catalogue, though they would have been acquired years earlier. The 1874 library catalogue still omitted publishers' names, but did include places and dates of publication. By this date many of the objects of Harte's parodies were represented in the library by copies from newer printings. Some of the older copies had been retained, however, and in the library catalogue the place of publication for many of these is identified as "Phil.," which under the circumstances may be taken as an indication of a Peterson edition. Thus for Lever's Charles O'Malley, the Irish Dragoon (p. 490); Bulwer-Lytton's My Novel (pp. 118–119); most of the works of Timothy Shay Arthur , the target author of Harte's '"John Jenkins" (p. 43); Dumas' The Three Guardsmen and The Forty-five Guardsmen, objects of "The Ninety-nine Guardsmen" (pp. 265–266); most of the works of Mrs. Henry Wood , half the basis of Harte's "Selina Sedilia" (p. 913); and Dickens's Christmas Stories, including "The Haunted Man" and "A Christmas Carol" (p. 222). Peterson did not publish Jules Michelet's La Femme or Hugo's Fantine (part one of Les Misérables ): both were published in 1862 in English translation by Carleton (the former with Carleton's erstwhile partner Rudd). That 46. "Mercantile Library Building Fund," San Francisco Daily American Flag, 20 October 1865, p. 2. 47. Quotation from the catalogue in Speech of George Francis Train (1865, see note 8 above). A report from mid-1865 numbered the Mercantile Library's collections at 20,000 volumes; the collection of the Bancroft Company was then at its largest reported size (200,000 volumes) but was not open to the public ("Notes on Books and Booksellers. Literature of the Pacific Coast," American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular 5 [15 July 1865]: 122, reprinting the San Francisco Weekly Bulletin of unknown date). Harte could have availed himself of another library mentioned in the same report: the reading room of the What Cheer House, a San Francisco "temperance" hotel catering only to men, said to contain 5,000 volumes. Two years later, in "A Californian Caravansary," an article for Harper's Monthly, Charles Henry Webb counted "between three thousand and four thousand volumes." What Cheer proprietor R. B. Woodward established the library by purchasing the first fifteen hundred books from the Harpers—titles, Webb said, that were selected for their "good moral tendency" ( Harper's New Monthly Magazine 35 [April 1867): 603–606, quotations from p. 605). An earlier account made of this library observed that it included "nearly four hundred volumes of the best fictitious works, including several from Dickens, Irving, Scott, Cooper, Miss Bremer, Marryat, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and others" ("Library of the What Cheer House, San Francisco " Hutchings' California Magazine 5 [January 1861]: 294–295; an informative illustration of this library is provided on p. 295). summer they were treated by Harte in the Golden Era (the text of "Fantine" that reappeared in the Saturday Press was taken from the 1865 reprint in the Californian ). Harte could have seen the originals of these works in the Mercantile Library as well: La Femme appears in the 1861 catalogue; Carleton's Les Misérables: Fantine appears in the 1874 catalogue (like the original French edition, it was not available until 1862). The library also owned a copy of Belle Boyd in Camp and Prison, the memoir of Confederate spy Maria Isabella Boyd , as introduced by George A. Sala : this work was the object of Harte's " Mary McGillup ." Harte may have found his own way to the Mercantile Library, or he may have been encouraged by a mentor, Thomas Starr King (1824–64), to whom he would dedicate Condensed Novels and Other Papers. San Francisco's wartime Unitarian minister and civic leader took an active interest in Harte's literary and political fortunes. Starr King had once been at the center of Mercantile Library activities in Boston and he began arranging to speak at the San Francisco branch even before departing for his Pacific pulpit. Harte heard the series of lectures he eventually gave there, calling them "too good for this latitude." 48 In his turn, Harte may have encouraged Mark Twain to use the library. In 1865 and 1866, Mark Twain made his patronage of the Mercantile Library known more than once in his San Francisco writings, and when the ejaculation, "Bilk!" appears in "Me," Harte's rendering of Bulwer-Lytton's My Novel, Californian readers would have recognized the reference. Mark Twain's lexicographic excursus on this word, for which he relied on "authorities in the Mercantile Library," appeared in the Californian on 8 July 1865, and Harte's "Me" appeared in the following issue. An exceptional "Condensed Novel," apparently unconnected to the Mercantile Library or a T. B. Peterson edition, was "NN ... a Novel in the French Paragraphic Style." This essay seems to have been inspired by the literary Francophilia Harte recognized in the work of his Bohemian colleagues, Charles Henry Webb above all. A few weeks after "NN" appeared, Harte received news of the death of "McArone," the Bohemian poet and humorist George Arnold . In a tribute to Arnold penned for the Californian, Harte remarked that Arnold "early adopted from the French, that pithy, curt, epigrammatic, paragraphic style, which Chanes Henry Webb , his only successful rival, has introduced to such popularity on this coast in his 'Things.'" 49 The familiarity Harte exhibits in his obituary with the work of Arnold, which appeared mainly in the small literary papers of New York , suggests a possibility that Harte saw "Flimsy Fiction" in the 48. Starr King's relations with the Mercantile Library east and west are revealed in Edward Everett Hale's James Russell Lowell and His Friends ( Boston and New York : Houghton Mifflin , 1898 and 1899), pp. 66–67; and Robert B. Swain , "Address before the First Unitarian Society of San Francisco , in Memory of Their Late Pastor, Rev. Thomas Starr King " ( San Francisco : Frank Eastman , 1864), pp. 7–12. Harte's evaluation of Starr King's lectures at the San Francisco Mercantile Library is given in a letter to Edwin Percy Whipple , 29 October 1865, reprinted in Autograph i (September-October 1912): 152 (MS in the Library of the University of California at Los Angeles , Department of Special Collections, Collection of Bret Harte Letters 1860–1902). 49. Bret Harte , " George Arnold ," New York Saturday Press 3 (23 December 1865): 322–323, reprinting the Californian 3 (18 November 1865): 8. "Things" was the name Webb gave to his feuilleton-like column in the Golden Era, begun in 1863; in 1864 he moved it to the Californian, eventually changing its name to "Inigoings" (derived from "Inigo," one of his pennames). New York Leader, Arnold's review of an adventure novel by a Peterson author, in which he also generally criticizes Peterson as a publisher of "dingy and inelegant" books. 50 Harte also revealed an emotional connection to Arnold , an indication of the wider affinities between the New York Bohemians and what may be seen as their San Francisco offspring. These were a small group of Californian contributors and editors, including the young poets Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith , the storyteller Prentice Mulford , and critics James F. Bowman and Tremenheere Lanyon Johns . For a time the actor Dan Setchell and the artist Edward Jump were also with them. Albert S. Evans , the straight-laced local reporter of the San Francisco Alta California , referred contemptuously to the group and particularly its perceived leaders, Mark Twain and Charles Henry Webb , as the "Bohemian Mutual Admiration Society." 51 Especially as personified in Charles Henry Webb , the relationship to Clapp's Bohemia became the motivator by which the works of Harte and Mark Twain were showcased in the East, and national recognition began to attach to their names. Webb and Harte did not always see eye to eye, and may have had a falling out in 1866, so Harte's success with Carleton could have been attained independently of the influence which Webb would have been in a position to exert. 52 Webb had come to California from the New York Times in 1863; when he left San Francisco in April 1866, Harte took over the editorial chair of the Californian. Webb returned to New York and was soon back at the Times, where in November he published a parody of Charles Reade's successful novel Griffith Gaunt; or, Jealousy (under the misprinted title, "Lippits Lank; or, Lunacy"). The following month Carleton , one of the American publishers of Reade's novel, brought out Webb's work as a brochure, with illustrations by Sol Eytinge , Jr. (and the title repaired to "Liffith Lank"). 53 Webb would arrange Mark Twain's 50. New York Leader 11 (14 October 1865): 1. 51. Evans's attitude was partly an outcome of his defense of the police and San Francisco municipal authorities, which Mark Twain repeatedly accused of brutality and malfeasance in his daily letter to the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. In the feud that developed between the two reporters, Evans reserved his most contemptuous remarks for "Our San Francisco Correspondence," his weekly letter to the Gold Hill (Nevada) Evening News, which he signed "Amigo"; for "Bohemian Mutual Admiration Society," see the issues of 13 January and 5 February 1866 (p. 2). Long after Webb and Mark Twain had departed for the east, Johns and Bowman helped found San Francisco's Bohemian Club; though their memories of the 1860s provided the inspiration for this enterprise, the club's formal status and especially its exclusion of women were little in keeping with the spirit of Clapp's Bohemia . 52. Webb was a major contributor to Outcroppings, the volume of California poetry that Harte edited in 1865; as such he was offended by the editorial introduction, wherein Harte—who contributed no poems of his own—excused the volume's poems for their artistic modesty. Webb reacted in "Inigoings," his weekly column in the Californian, ridiculing Harte as a successful family man with a "lucrative" sinecure at the San Francisco Mint and a talent for "idiomatic English." A final estrangement between the two men may be reflected in a seemingly frosty tone adopted by Harte in his surviving letter to Webb, reporting on the disposition of the Californian, which Webb left in Harte's care when he departed San Francisco ("Inigoings," Californian 4 [10 February 1866]: 1; see note 4 above). 53. C. H. Webb , "Lippits Lank; or, Lunacy: A Tale that He who Runs may Reade," New York Times, ii November 1866; reportedly the pamphlet version of this work was in its third printing (with a Carleton title page) when the Philadelphia Evening Telegram printed an abridged text without crediting Webb. An unsigned exposé of this unauthorized reprinting then appeared in the New York Times; it was likely Webb's own work ("A Remarkable Piece of Literary Enterprise," 22 January 186y). Webb would publish further travesties with Carleton (nominally, at least), which were later gathered in Parodies: Prose and Verse ( Carleton , 1876). unlucky meeting with Carleton , but his involvement in Harte's more fortunate encounter has not been established. Harte's reaction to Wit and Humor, if he did know of this book, is not preserved. It is safe to assume that he would have been displeased at any attempt to pirate his "Condensed Novels" before he had collected them himself. Mark Twain was in a somewhat different position and may have been the least injured of the burglarized authors. He was not then ready to publish a book of his own, and his slight Eastern reputation could only have been helped by the publicity. Conceivably the other authors on the list, especially those whose work was available in authorized editions, might have been moved by the advertisement to take action; they or their publishers might even have eventually stifled distribution of Wit and Humor. The other contributors named in the advertisements for the volume were better established than either of the San Franciscans , and constitute a representative roster of American Civil War-era humor. "Artemus Ward" was first the creation of Charles Farrar Browne and then his adopted persona. Browne was a national celebrity as a lecturer, having extended the reach of his fame by appearing across the continent; though he had as yet published only one book, few American authors counted as many readers. His columns in Vanity Fair and the Sunday Mercury were widely reprinted and Artemus Ward: His Book (Carleton, 1862) sold more than forty thousand copies in its first six months, an unheard of sale for a humorous work—until Carleton brought out Artemus Ward: His Travels in 1865, with fifty thousand advance orders. 54 He would depart for England in June 1866, where he would achieve his greatest and final triumphs, at age 33. Robert Henry Newell , author of the "Orpheus C. Kerr Papers" in the New York Sunday Mercury, was near the summit of his celebrity in March 1866, having published three volumes of these satires on wartime office-seeking and Copperheadism. Henry Wheeler Shaw (1818–85) was the author of a new book, Josh Billings, Hiz Sayings ( Carleton , 1866). He was on the eve of greater popularity as a humorist, but his adoptive name was already familiar to a large public as belonging to the author of purely comic sketches cast in a scrambled alphabet and grammar. " Mrs. Partington ," sometimes described as the American " Mrs. Malaprop ," was the widely followed creation of Boston journalist Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber (1814–90). In the early 1850s Shillaber edited The Carpet-Bag, the humor magazine in which Mrs. Partington was featured. The future Artemus Ward became a Carpet-Bag contributor soon after Shillaber engaged him as a typesetter. (Conceivably, the young printer could have set up "The Dandy Frightening the Squatter," a river 54. J. C. Derby , Fifty Years among Authors, Books and Publishers ( G. W. Carleton and Co., 1884), p. 242; " George W. Carleton Retires," Publisher's Weekly 29 (22 May 1886): 651. Carleton announced the fifty thousand advance orders for Artemus's second book in "Carleton, Publisher," American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular 5 (15 October 1865): 279.

Clemens , aged sixteen.) David Ross Locke (1833–88) achieved success during the secession crisis and the war as the creator of an ignorant proslavery preacher, the "Rev. Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby." Satires signed with this name appeared in the Toledo Blade and were widely reprinted; they were appreciated by President Lincoln as a counterweight to Copperhead propaganda in the North. Beginning in 1861, Joseph Barber 1808–74) contributed over one hundred letters to the New York Sunday Mercury over the signature "A disbanded volunteer." Written in a difficult backwoods dialect, the letters were strongly for Lincoln; in 1864 they were collected in a book, "affeckshinately inskribed" to " Abraham Lincoln of Illannoy, the loftiest of livin statesmen. ..." "Figaro" was Henry Clapp . His writings had appeared in a half-dozen New York papers over the past ten years, but his contributions to Wit and Humor were likely taken from the dramatic columns appearing over this signature in the Leader. George Arnold was one of Clapp's closest associates; the wide public following he gained for his work as the correspondent "McArone" is suggested in Harte's obituary. These were witty letters, devoted at first to the war for Italian independence and then to the U.S. Civil War; they were published in Vanity Fair until 1863 and then in the New York Leader, and were widely reprinted. Owing to the loving editorial work of his friend, the critic William Winter , Arnold can be more easily appreciated today for his poetry than for his McArone correspondence, which remains mainly uncollected. 55 A few oddities in the advertisements for Wit and Humor can be noted. All four versions take care to credit Bret's "Condensed Novels" to the Californian. The presence of "Figaro" on the list, in keeping with the apparent intention of the compiler of Wit and Humor to include the comedy of the Bohemian writers, is puzzling from another perspective. Clapp's penname is present in all the advertisements, including those appearing in the nine consecutive issues of his own Saturday Press. This means that Clapp had foreknowledge of Wit and Humor, and must have approved of its publication. Why he should have accepted an advertisement of an apparent pirate anthology of his own writings and those of his contributors begs further questions—especially concerning the possibility of his own active involvement in the affair. IV In April 1867, "Mr. C. H. Webb" announced himself as a publisher by advertising three books for sale in a number of newspapers. Mark Twain's first authorized book, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, And other Sketches, wxsould be ready on 24 April (the event may have been delayed by a few days); it was offered only in cloth, for $1.50. Also available were Webb's own "travesties": a revised and enlarged Liffith Lank and the new St. Twel'mo, a burlesque 55. A burlesque pamphlet by "McArone," Life and Adventures of Jeff. Davis, appeared in 1865, with comic illustrations possibly by Arnold ( New York : J. C. Haney and Co.); William Winter edited two collections of Arnold's poems: Drift: A Seashore-Idyll and Other Poems ( Boston : Ticknor and Fields , 1866), and Poems Grave and Gay ( Ticknor and Fields , 1867), which were combined in George Arnold's Poems: Complete Edition (Fields and Osgood, 1871). treatment of St. Elmo, a sentimental novel by the Southern writer Augusta Jane Evans , published by Carleton in the previous year. These, the advertisements informed, were the "first instalments of his catalogue"; other "new and popular works would follow in rapid succession." Booksellers were instructed to place their orders with the "American News Company, Agents" at 119 and 121 Nassau Street, New York . Those interested in single copies were told to apply directly to Webb, though he did not list a separate address for himself. 56 At this time Mark Twain was in New York , having recently returned from a visit to his family in Missouri. He would soon depart on the excursion to Europe and the Holy Land that would result in The Innocents Abroad (a book that would sell nearly seventy thousand copies in its first year). Shortly before embarking he instructed friend and lecture manager Frank Fuller to collect from Webb his share of the profits from the sales of his book and forward them to his mother. That he did not ask Webb to do this is perhaps a sign that a rift had already opened between the author and his publisher. Mark Twain believed that he would receive ten cents per copy; he eventually received nothing and was much perturbed. Webb did not last long in the trade, and brought forth no further volumes after the three announced in his first advertisement. A document produced to help resolve the dispute over Mark Twain's book indicates that Webb was actively selling the three books into 1870. By the fall of that year, a total of 3,826 copies of Jumping Frog had been printed and bound; according to the same record, Webb's own works fared somewhat better, showing a combined total of over 9,500 copies printed by the fall of 1869. 57 Webb seems to have been pleased with the sales of his travesties: already in January 1867 he boasted in the Times of the "remarkable success" of the early Liffith Lank (under Carleton's imprint), which had "reached the third edition." Many years later he inquired of fellow ex-Bohemian Edmund Clarence Stedman , "Didn't I confuse the wretches of publishers who refused my travesties by publishing them myself and making money out of them?" 58 Mark Twain was not as happy. Jumping Frog sales were a disappointment in the first place; in the second, he claimed to have received no royalty from them 56. " C. H. Webb ," Nation 4 (25 April 1867): 342; this advertisement also appeared in the Philadelphia trade journal American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular 9 (1 May 1867): 26 (with the alternate title, "To the Trade"). 57.

The document recording printing and binding information is a copy of a statement by Webb's printer and binder, Samuel W. Green (of [ John A .] Gray and Green , a firm that had briefly employed the teen-aged Samuel Clemens as a typesetter in 1853). Dated 10 December 1870, Green's statement is preserved in the Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California (CU-MARK); it has been transcribed and discussed by Robert Hirst in Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volume 1: 1851–1864, op. cit., pp. 544–545, 545 n. 43. 58.

( New York : Moffat , Yard and Co., 1910), quotation from 2:275; "A Remarkable Piece of Literary Enterprise," op. cit. In an article praising Jumping Frog as "not unworthy of a place beside the works of John Phrenix , A. Ward's books , and the two volumes of the Rev. Mr. Nasby ," the Nation explained of the early Liffith Lank that "Webb was really its publisher, though it bore the imprint of G. W. Carleton &amp; Co." and that it has "sold very well indeed" (" Mr. Charles Webb ...," Nation 4 [9 May 1867]: 369). at all. In 1906 he recalled that Webb pleaded in 1869 or 1870 that Jumping Frog had been a complete loss to him, and the American News Company had taken all the profits. Mark Twain further recounted a meeting with the manager of the American News Company (for which no independent corroboration has been found), who, he said, proved with his "books and accounts" that Webb had been regularly paid for the sales of Jumping Frog. Mark Twain concluded that "Webb had collected his dues and mine regularly from the beginning and had pocketed the money." 59 Contemporary evidence indicates that Mark Twain's memory of the thirty-five year-old events was at least partly accurate. On 22 January 1870 he did inform his new publisher, Elisha Bliss , "I am prosecuting Webb in the N. Y. Courts—think the result will be that he will yield up the copyright &amp; plates of the Jumping Frog, if I let him off from paying me money. Then I shall break up those plates, &amp; prepare a new vol. of Sketches, but on a different &amp; more 'taking' model." 60 No independent record of Mark Twain's actions against Webb have been discovered; in November of 1870 he apologized to his friend for having hired a lawyer. On 22 December he reported to Bliss that he had settled matters with Webb: according to Mark Twain's accounting in that letter, he obtained full rights to his book in exchange for $600 in forgone royalties and an additional payment of $800. 61 The settlement rankled the author, and it would seem that Webb had held firm, perhaps maintaining that he had been cheated by the American News Company, perhaps feeling that he had done more than anyone to promote Mark Twain and deserved some recognition and profit for this. In the same letter to Stedman cited above, Webb recited some of the services he performed for Mark Twain and other California writers. Did I not publish Mark Twain when all the publishers refused him? Didn't I pilot him to Sacramento for an engagement with the Union to write letters from the Sandwich Islands? Didn't I get his hat checked to the Islands and back when the Union wouldn't advance the money for his fare? And who reared the stately columns of the Californian and enshrined therein Bret Harte , Mark Clemens , Ina Coolbrith , Charles Warren Stoddard , and others too tedious to mention? It is testimony to the rapid success of the American News Company that it distributed both Beadle's Dime Book of Fun No. 3, where the jumping frog story appeared without authorial sanction, as well as the authorized edition of Jumping Frog. The firm's collaboration with Beadle and Company took place immediately upon its founding in 1864, and on a colossal scale. The address of the American News Company given in Webb's advertisement was already occupied in the early 59.

Hirst has further commented that the author had only an oral agreement with Webb, and its terms have not been precisely recovered. 1860s by Beadle's distributor, the agency of Sinclair Tousey . The founding of the new company was the final stage in a long and turbulent process of mergers and takeovers in the news business in New York . It was accomplished in the merger of the two most powerful agencies issuing from this process: Tousey and Company and H. Dexter , Hamilton . 62 Beadle and Company, then America's most prolific publisher, automatically became one of their largest clients. A pioneer publisher of mass-market books, Beadle supplied soldiers and civilians alike throughout the Civil War with a variety of cheaply made books costing a "dime" or "half-dime." Beadle's list in the mid-1860s comprised hundreds of commissioned works, including biographies, adventure stories, and sensationalized treatments of episodes from American history. The American News Company distributed these editions from its founding; in an oft-repeated phrase, the company kept a "standing order for sixty thousand copies" of each Beadle title. 63 This figure could well have been accurate. The North American Review of July 1864 noted that, up to April ist, an aggregate of five millions of Beadle's Dime Books had been put in circulation, of which half at least were novels, nearly a third songs, and the remainder hand-books, biographies, &amp;c.... The sales of single novels by popular authors often amount to nearly forty thousand in two or three months. ... Over 350,000 copies of the Dime Song-Book No. 1 have been sold. The Dime National Tax Law has reached a circulation of more than 200,000 copies. The first edition of the Dime Novel "Seth Jones" was 60,000 copies. Sales almost unprecedented in the annals of booksellers. 64 An article in the Round Table of 21 April 1866 reported that in addition to distributing most of the nation's magazines and weekly papers (measured by the number of copies), the American News Company was also handling 225,000 dime pub- 62. Sinclair Tousey's name and address (121 Nassau St.) appear on early Beadle titles; see, for example the cover of Louis Le Grand, M. D., The Military Hand-Book and Soldier's Manual of Information, Beadle's Dime Series ( New York : Beadle and Co., 1862). An account of the merger that created the American News Company is in "Sketches of the Publishers: The American News Company III," Round Table 3 (21 April 1866): 250 (see also the two previous parts of this long article, in the issues for 7 and 14 April). The close relations of Beadle and Company and Tousey and the American News Company are also discussed by Albert Johannsen in his history The House of Beadle and Adams and Its Dime and Nickel Novels: The Story of a Vanished Literature, vol. I, foreword by John T. McIntyre ( Norman : Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1950). Johannsen believed, for example, that the series American Tales begun by Sinclair Tousey or the American News Company in 1863 was actually published by Beadle , which took nominal control of the series with the issuance of the forty-fifth volume in 1868 (see Johannsen , pp. 45–48, 55). 63. An early (and possibly original) use of this phrase appears in George C. Jenks's "Dime Novel Makers": "In the old days enormous numbers were sold of each new story, as it appeared, the standing order of the American News Company, which handled the bulk of the edition, being sixty thousand copies. Often these, sixty thousand would be all sold in a week, with other editions following each other from week to week. Some novels ran into as many as ten or twelve editions" (Bookman 20 [October 1904]: 113). The wording, "standing order" of "sixty thousand copies," has been since repeated in many works of historical scholarship, though without credit to Jenks or any other source. 64. "Beadle's Dime Books ... 1859–1864," North American Review 99 (July 1864): 303–309, quotation from 303–304. lications per month. The historian of Beadle and Company, Albert Johannsen , found an article in the New York Herald maintaining that the first twenty dime novels (introduced in 1860) had sold 4,352,000 copies by 1 July 1865. 65 No publication or sales figures for Dime Book of Fun No. 3 have been discovered, but it seems safe to assume that this volume was printed and distributed in many thousands of copies, perhaps five or ten times as many as the authorized Jumping Frog. (Given its price, however, the Dime Book of Fun might not have returned as much to Beadle and Company as Mark Twain thought his $1.50 book returned to Webb.) The third and last in the series of Beadle anthologies collecting previously published humorous works contained 80 pages and included, without authorization, as far as is known, three stories by Mark Twain : "'Mark Twain' on the Launch of the Steamer 'Capital,'" "Fitz Smythe's Horse," and "Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog." While the three pieces are prize examples of Mark Twain's Western writing, the Beadle compiler did much to obliterate their charm. Of the "Launch" sketch, originally written for the Californian, only about half—the "Scriptural Panoramist" section—was selected; the cut-down part was framed with introductory and concluding passages written by someone other than Mark Twain , and retitled "Story Number Six." Beadle reprinted only about one-third of the jumping frog story, in a form showing much tinkering in the dialect. "Fitz Smythe's Horse" is an extract from one of Mark Twain's daily San Francisco letters to the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise, now otherwise lost (see note 41). The poorly typeset Beadle text is nevertheless coterminous with the extract as it was reprinted three months earlier in the Golden Era; it would therefore seem to derive from it, or a lost intermediate reprinting of the Golden Era text, rather than the Enterprise itself. The number of surviving copies of the third Dime Book of Fun is higher than it would have been had not collectors and libraries identified it, as early as in the 1890s, as the first book publication of the jumping frog story. 66 Expressions of this appreciation rarely mention, however, that Beadle's "Jim Smiley's Frog" is only a slight extract of Mark Twain's Saturday Press story. In "My Début as a Literary Person," an essay appearing in the Century Magazine in 1899, Mark Twain recalled with bemusement the hopes he had once attached to an early journalistic "scoop." It came during his time as Hawaii correspondent of the Sacramento Union, a job secured for him by Webb , who, as 65. For the Round Table article, see note 62 above; Johannsen (op. cit., p. 49) cites Prentiss Ingraham, "The Classic Dime Novel and Its Gradual Disappearance," New York Herald, 3 February 1901. 66. A long description of the third Dime Book of Fun, based on an examination of multiple copies, is given in Merle Johnson's A Bibliography of the Works of Mark Twain , Revised and Enlarged ( New York : Harper and Brothers, 1935), pp. 5–6. A photo facsimile of the cover and further discussion can be found in Albert Johannsen , op. cit., pp. 404–406. A copy came to the New York Public Library in 1922, as part of its acquisition of nearly 1,600 separate Beadle titles: see The Beadle Collection of Dime Novels Given to the New York Public Library by Dr. Frank P. O'Brien ( New York : New York Public Library, 1922), pp. 1, 14, 22. CU-MARK acquired a copy of this volume in 1973, as part of the Appert Collection. " John Paul ," was the Union's popular San Francisco correspondent. In June 1866 the author was in Honolulu when most of the survivors of the Hornet, a clipper ship that had burned at sea, were brought there. Inopportunely suffering from severe saddle-boils, Mark Twain had himself carried on a stretcher to the convalescing men and with the help of a friend (the U.S. minister to China, Anson Burlingame) recorded their testimony. He worked all night on a long report of the ordeal and posted it on a San Francisco-bound schooner the following morning (likely 25 June); on 19 July the story appeared on the front page of the Union, then the West's most important and widest-circulating newspaper. No other paper east or west was able to present a more focused picture of the Hornet disaster. Mark Twain's letter gave a detailed account of the calamity—the uncontrollable fire that broke out in the hold of the kerosene-laden ship; the call to abandon ship in the remote South Pacific; the three lifeboats and thirty-one men that came away with ten days' rations each; and the single boat that survived forty-three days at sea, landing safely (with the help of alert Hawaiians) at the island of Hawaii. Not one of the fifteen occupants of the boat was lost. All owed their lives to their helmsman, the Hornet 's captain, Josiah A. Mitchell of Freeport, Maine. He had carefully controlled the skimpy rations while piloting the craft across an estimated four thousand miles of ocean. Mark Twain was aware that he had described a great feat of navigation, one of the greatest in American history, equal to that of William Bligh's escape three-quarters of a century earlier. 67 He wrote his mother that the story might be reprinted "all over the world." He was not far wrong. A condensed version soon appeared in the hometown paper of two surviving passengers, the Stamford (Conn.) Advocate (17 August). Then the New York Herald, one of the nation's highest-circulating periodicals, reprinted the greater part of the letter on 27 August. It was thereafter copied far 67. Mark Twain's writings reveal that the ordeal of the Hornet's boat bore striking similarities to Bligh's experience ("Letter from Honolulu," Sacramento Union, 19 July 1866, p. 1; "Forty-three Days in an Open Boat," Harper's New Monthly Magazine 34 [December 1866]: 104–113). In his memoir Bligh records the forced voyage he made after being expelled by mutiny from the Bounty in April 1789. The ship's twenty-three-foot launch, with nineteen occupants, a quadrant, compass, and scant rations, reached "the coast of Timor in forty-one days ... having in that time run, by our log, a distance of 3618 miles; and that, notwithstanding our extreme distress, no one should have perished in the voyage" (Lieutenant William Bligh , A Voyage to the South Sea, London : George Nicol , 1792, pp. 154–160, 176, 227, 237; quotation from p. 227). In "Letter from Honolulu," Mark Twain noted that after twenty-four days, the Captain Mitchell reckoned his boat was approximately 1,000 miles from where the Hornet burned (a point arrived at by a presumably circuitous route). In "Forty-three Days" Mark Twain gave his considered estimate of Captain Mitchell's odyssey as "4000 miles in reality and 3360 by direct courses" (p. 112). Another source gives a more modest measure of 2,500 miles ("Terrible Disaster at Sea," Sailors' Magazine, and Seamen's Friend 39 [November 1866]: 68, reprinting the Pacific Commercial Advertiser). That figure is incorrectly low, even if it was meant to convey the distance in nautical miles. Mark Twain reported the latitude and longitude coordinates Samuel Ferguson recorded as the Hornet's location when it burned; accordingly the direct distance from that point to Laupahoehoe, Hawaii , where the men landed, is over 3,140 statue miles (2,728 nautical miles). Additional coordinates reported in "Forty-three Days" allow the 4,000-statute-mile journey to be plotted: see the chart on p. 78 of "My Début as a Literary Person" (see note 69). and wide, in the United States , England , and Australia . 68 Not long after posting his story, Mark Twain left Hawaii, sailing on the Smyrniote, another clipper, bound for San Francisco. Among his fellow passengers were Captain Mitchell and two other Hornet survivors, Samuel and Henry Ferguson (the Stamfordians). All three had kept diaries during the ordeal, which they allowed Mark Twain to copy; from the entries he fashioned "Forty-three Days in an Open Boat," a documentary history of the experience with his commentary, which he submitted to Harper's Monthly. As explained in "My Début," his expectation was that an appearance in the most important magazine in New York would secure for him an Eastern reputation. The piece was accepted and published, but his plan to achieve fame by it was frustrated, when in the Harper's annual index his article was attributed, so he recalled, to "Mike Swain" (actually the entry read "Mark Swain"). 69 Mark Twain's memory in "My Début" was selective; the view he remembers having in 1866, of discounting the importance of the jumping frog story's publication because it appeared "in a mere newspaper" (the Saturday Press ) was not entirely accurate. By placing "Forty-three Days" in Harper's Monthly he did hope to enlarge upon the renown the jumping frog tale had brought him, but was foiled when the Harper's typesetter failed to recognize his name in manuscript. The choice of Harper's may have been guided by " C. H. Webb " and " Fitz Hugh Ludlow ," Harper's index names belonging to two writers whom Mark Twain looked upon as mentors. Ludlow (1836–70) was the author of The Hasheesh Eater, anonymously published by Harper and Brothers in 1857. In addition to his contributions to Harper's Monthly, Ludlow wrote for the Atlantic and many New York papers; like his friend Artemus Ward he had been a subeditor of Vanity Fair. Like Artemus he traveled west in 1863, accompanying the painter Albert Bierstadt ; in San Francisco he became a contributor to the Golden Era. Before returning to the East, he offered an assessment of California writers that included high praise for Mark Twain and Bret Harte . "Harper's and the Atlantic," he said, would welcome contributions from Harte; of Mark Twain he stated that in "funny literature, that Irresistible Washoe Giant, Mark Twain , takes quite a unique position. He makes me laugh more than any Californian since poor Derby [John 68. The extent to which Mark Twain's Sacramento Union letter was copied has not been fully explored; in the United States it also appeared in the [ Portland , Me.] Eastern Argus (18 August 1866), the McConnelsville , Ohio, Conservative (7 September 1866); internationally it appeared in the Liverpool Mercury (11 September 1866), the Belfast News-Letter (13 September), the [ London ] Penny Illustrated Paper (15 September), the [ Sydney ] Empire (27 November), the Sydney Morning Herald (29 November), the [ Hobart , Tasmania] Mercury (30 November), the Brisbane Courier (4 December), Queanbeyan [ New South Wales ] Age and General Advertiser (13 December), the [ Brisbane ] Queenslander (15 December), the Perth Gazette and West Australia Times (1 February 1867). Mark Twain and the Sacramento Union were both credited in the New York Herald and some other reprints in the United States; in other reprints, especially those in Britain and its dominions, only the Union received credit. 69. "'My Début as a Literary Person' by Mark Twain (formerly 'Mike Swain')," Century Magazine 59 (November 1899): 76–88; the Harper's index was the only place where contributors' names were revealed; the index for volume 34 (where "Forty–three Days" appeared) was printed in the first issue of volume 35 (December 1866). Phrenix] died. He imitates nobody. He is a school by himself." 70 Ludlow need not have pointed his new friends in the direction of Harper's Monthly, however: Mark Twain would have known it as one of the few American periodicals with a national circulation. Each issue then appeared in over one hundred thousand copies; ten thousand alone were sent to California (a number about equal to the complete print runs of the leading California newspapers). The Atlantic's issue of perhaps fifty thousand copies was barely less impressive, but this magazine did not then attract his designs. 71 Its reputation could have put him off for the same reasons that it attracted Bret Harte , who there published "The Legend of Monte del Diablo" in 1863: the Atlantic was regarded as a repository of higher culture and learning, and a keeper of a polite Bostonian attitude. This perception was a somewhat distorted one, since the standing of the Atlantic was in great measure created by the saucy essays of Holmes and the vernacular voice of Hosea Biglow; Fitz Hugh Ludlow , furthermore, was a favored contributor by 1865. While Mark Twain might have approached the Atlantic (perhaps with something other than "Forty-three Days"), his Pfaffian connections would have afforded him clearer advantage at Harper's. While the Hornet 's men were undergoing their tortuous ordeal, Mark Twain was having an opposite experience. In April and May of 1866 he was enjoying the hospitality of several American sugar barons and especially the company of their daughters, during five weeks of leisure on the island of Maui. On 22 May he returned to Honolulu from what he called a "perfect jubilee to me in the way of pleasure." "Few such months," he wrote his sister-in-law, Mollie Clemens, "come in a lifetime." He did no work at all nor even allowed himself to think of "business, or care, or human toil or trouble or sorrow or weariness." But his thoughts did not linger long on his tropical idyll. He soon turned to confront his own uncertain future and the care-worn lives of his family back in the States. He fumed about the Clemens family's failure to profit from a Tennessee land holding and then paused long enough to reflect on a literary matter. "If I were in the east, now," he told his correspondent, "I could stop the publication of a piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches." 72 By this "complaint" Mark Twain was slyly informing the family that he was known outside the West, as an author whose work Eastern publishers valued enough to steal. Scholars have assumed that the piracy in question was Beadle's Dime Book of Fun No. 3, which issued in New York on 19 April 1866. Yet it is difficult to see 70. Fitz Hugh Ludlow , "P. P. C., A Good-bye Article," Golden Era 11 (22 November 1863): 4. Mark Twain would later reveal the meaning of the prefatory initials used by Ludlow in the title: they stood for "Pay Parting Call," and were customarily inscribed on the calling card of a neighbor who planned to leave town, requesting a visit from the recipient (see The Gilded Age, ch. 33). 71. [ Alfred Hudson Guernsey ], "Making the Magazine," Harper's New Monthly Magazine 32 (December 1865): 1—31, see pp. 2, 15, 21. George P. Rowell's American Newspaper Directory (1869, op. cit.) gives the Atlantic's circulation, probably for 1867 (p. 177), and lists five San Francisco papers as claiming 10,000 or more in circulation (also for the year 1867); the largest, 14,000, is claimed for the San Francisco Morning Call (pp. 11, 175). 72. Quotations from Samuel L. Clemens (SLC) to Mary E. (Mollie) Clemens, 22 May 1866, in Mark Twain's Letters, Volume 1:1853–1866, op. cit., pp. 341–342; see also in the same volume SLC to Jane Lampton Clemens , 4 May 1866, pp. 336–337. how Mark Twain could have heard of this book in time to have mentioned it to his sister-in-law on 22 May: the authors of the pieces it contained were not advertised in advance and the date of publication was too late for news of its appearance to have reached him in Hawaii. On the other hand, each advertisement for Wit and Humor did include a list of contributors, with his name on it; these, furthermore, began to appear on 14 March, soon enough for Mark Twain to have received news of them. Given where the advertisements were printed, they were bound to attract the attention of his literary friends and associates. In light of his remark that he could have stopped publication were he in the States, he may have been sent a clipping of the advertisement in one of the three versions in which it was implied that the book was still in preparation. The present state of the evidence, therefore, no longer permits an assumption that the piracy to which Mark Twain referred in his letter was the Beadle book. His reference more reasonably fits Wit and Humor; or Odds and Ends, which boldly announced itself in journals that had been legitimately promoting the Eastern reputations of many of the mysterious piracy's unwitting contributors, including newcomers Mark Twain and Bret Harte . DIRECTORIES OF AMERICAN BOOKSTORES TO 1950: ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA by Michael Winship On p. 153 of my essay, "'The Tragedy of the Book Industry'?: Bookstores and Book Distribution in the United States to 1950" (Studies in Bibliography 58 [2007–2008]: 145–184), I confessed my ignorance of the existence of directories of shoe stores but, as I was reading proof for the article, I discovered that at least one such directory does exist. It is The Boot And Shoe Trade Containing A List Of The Boot And Shoe Manufacturers And Dealers In The United States ( New York : Wm. F. Bartlett, 1859), and a copy is at the American Antiquarian Society (MWA). There may well be others. In 1860 the same publisher issued a bookstore directory that I listed as no. 4 in the checklist accompanying my essay. When the checklist was published, I had not yet examined this directory, but based my entry on a report of an incomplete copy in the collections of the Boston Public Library (MB). Below is a full description of the directory based on my examination of the MB copy and of another in the collections of the Columbia University Library (NNC). I can now also give a full description, based on a copy from the libraries of the University of Illinois (IU), of the bookstore directory published by the H. W. Wilson Company in August 1910 that was listed as no. 43 and there described as "not seen." Inevitably, in the time since the checklist was published, I have also discovered a few directories that I missed when I made my initial survey. These are listed here as nos. 9.3, 9.7, and 43.5. Additional locations of surviving copies of bookstore directories that were listed in the published checklist are: nos. 14 and 28 at the American Antiquarian Society (MWA), and nos. 15, 28, 58, 59, 62, and 63 at the Henry E. Huntington Library (CSmH). I welcome information on further additions or corrections to the checklist. 4.
