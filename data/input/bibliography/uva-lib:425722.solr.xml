      <field name="heading_text">The Emily Dickinson Fascicles by R. W. Franklin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The manuscript books Emily Dickinson constructed of her poems, known to us as fascicles or packets, have had so long a history of physical disruption and piecemeal publication that nearly a century after her death we are just coming to understand them. To Lavinia Dickinson, who discovered them after her sister's death, and to the early editors (1890-1945), they were only a source for poems, organized in other ways for publication. Thomas H. Johnson was the first to attempt to account for them, and in the variorum edition (1955) his notes recorded packet numbers for poems. 1 He had rearranged many of the fascicles that by then were in disarray, but the reordering was incomplete, and the edition, arranged differently, obscured actual order. Although in 1967, in The Editing of Emily Dickinson , I addressed the question of which sheets belonged to each fascicle, several problems remained unresolved. Shortsightedly, I did not attempt to establish the sequence within fascicles, and, to be sure, the following year Ruth Miller introduced us to new ways of thinking about them—as artistic gatherings in which not only the set of sheets but their sequence is of critical importance. 2 Despite Thomas Johnson's work, my own, and that of Ruth Miller, until recently we have had no satisfactory lists of the poems as Dickinson bound them and no edition that presented them in a manner convenient for fascicle study. Badly hampered, interest in these manuscript books nevertheless has continued. 3 The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson , which I recently edited, may be considered the fascicles' first edition. 4 They were restored as far as possible to original order, arranged chronologically, and, through facsimile reproduction, presented much as Lavinia Dickinson found them on that day in May 1886. The present essay will consider several aspects important to an understanding of these manuscript books. The essay begins by examining, rather than assuming, the authenticity of the fascicles and by explaining the way Dickinson constructed them. The initial section also describes their essential bibliographical characteristics and accounts for their number and numbering. After a brief review of the methods used in reconstructing the Dickinson arrangement, two major aspects are discussed at length: the chronology of poems and of manuscripts; and Dickinson's purposes, practical and aesthetic, in organizing her poems into manuscript books. The fascicles, it may be asserted, are central to understanding Dickinson's habits of composition and organization. Their implications for biography and criticism are pervasive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authenticity, Construction, and Extent One may wonder whether the fascicles were Emily Dickinson's. The authenticity of the handwriting is really not in question, but one may ask, with good reason, given the extraordinary manuscript history that followed the poet's death, whether the bound structures were hers—or an editorial construction. Since Dickinson left no statement that establishes their authenticity, her record must be the fascicles themselves. 5 Within each unit, uniformity of paper obtains or, in lieu of that, similarity of embossed design or other characteristics. Because of the quantity of sheets involved (over two hundred in bound volumes; nearly one hundred unbound) and the complexity of matching them appropriately, an editor is not likely to have assembled them. The complexity derives in part from Dickinson's patterns of copying in which certain pieces must be next to others. At times, for example, she used a separate leaf to finish a poem when she ran out of space on the sheet she was using. Such division of poems would have required her binding to maintain the proper association of the pieces. Authenticity is corroborated by others who saw the manuscripts in the first years after Dickinson's death. 6 Mabel Loomis Todd, who copied bound volumes in the late 1880s and indexed them in 1891, referred to "volumes" several times in her diary during this time, with explicit attribution in 1891: "David and I at work the entire morning on indexing Emily's original manuscripts—four hours, and did fourteen of her little tied up volumes." 7 In the preface to the second series of poems (1891), she explained that, when found, "most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets." 8 A few years later, during a lawsuit between Lavinia Dickinson and the Todds, the witnesses disagreed about many things relating to this poet, but the authenticity of the little volumes, attested to in several sworn statements, was never contradicted. 9 In preparing a fascicle Emily Dickinson first copied poems onto sheets of stationery. The copying occurred before assembly or binding. Bibliographically, the fascicles may be described as folio in 2's in format, for the sheets, folded by the manufacturer to form two leaves, remained independent, not inserted inside each other. In an important sense, Dickinson's unit was the sheet. No doubt, as we have seen, she intended to bind these manuscripts—on several occasions running a poem over onto a separate leaf (twice onto the next full sheet). Such leaves (and sheets) required binding to maintain the association, as did a slip bound, not pinned, in place in one early fascicle. But whether she bound slips or pinned them, they were only an extension of a particular sheet. So also were the leaves used for overflow. Although of full size and physically separate, they carried only the additional lines, with the remainder of the recto and all of the verso blank. Even though the fascicle would be bound, the next poem began on another sheet. To bind, Dickinson arranged several copied sheets, one atop another, with the single leaves included in the appropriate places. 10 She stab-bound the stacked sheets, punching two holes through their sides, from front to back, and threading them once through with string, which she tied on the front. "Sewing" may not be a good term for what she did. It suggests an in-and-out motion, with the thread or string carried in a needle, whereas Dickinson made two holes from the same direction, inserted string through them, and tied it. This procedure completed preparation of a fascicle. The poet did not provide her manuscript books with title pages, or even titles, did not put her name on them, and did not label, number, or otherwise identify them. They are without pagination or signature markings for binding. The poems are not alphabetical, and there are no contents lists, indexes, or other means of finding a specific one. It would appear that she did not maintain them in an order and that browsing was the chief means of dealing with them. There is, in addition, no indication that they were intended, as the name fascicle implies, to be installments of a larger book, issued, as it were, in parts. Because they form a nearly complete record of Dickinson's poetic activity for the years continuously covered by them, they might be seen as de facto installments of the larger work that is her opus for those years, but the term fascicle , of course, was not hers: Mabel Todd introduced it in Poems (1891). Given the variation among the fascicles, there is no physical indication, even in the recurrence of papers, that they were so intended. The fascicles are, simply, poems copied onto sheets of stationery and, without elaboration, bound together: individual manuscript books of simple construction. In all, Lavinia Dickinson found forty fascicles and enough unbound sheets for several others. The manuscripts also included some miscellaneous semifinal and fair copies and what Mabel Todd called "scraps" —drafts of poems on odds and ends of paper. There has been a lingering concern that there were more fascicles than the forty that have survived, a concern arising from irregularities in the Todd numbering of the manuscripts: 1-38, 40, 80-112. The gaps, especially the large one between 40 and 80, have seemed to suggest missing manuscripts. Yet the notebook survives in which in 1891 Todd indexed all the poems she knew about (still unpublished) in her numbers through 98. There were no entries for 39, 41-79, or, for that matter, 96. 11 We may be confident that the numbering does not represent lost manuscripts, but the irregularity has not heretofore been explained. The explanation, while complex, is also simple: Mabel Todd created two sequences of numbers—one below 40, the other above 80—with some of the manuscripts in the higher sequence coming from the lower one. There appears originally to have been a single sequence for the bound fascicles, 1-40, marked perhaps on envelopes but not on manuscripts (not marked until 1891). The forty were in Lavinia Dickinson's possession. From them, as has been demonstrated elsewhere, 12 number 39 became 80 and was transferred to Mabel Todd's possession, leaving a permanent gap at 39. In similar fashion, Todd had earlier organized manuscripts into a sequence beginning at 81. So 39, one of the bound fascicles, became 80 and sat next to five other bound fascicles, 81-85, that she had already transferred. These had previously been numbers 14, 33, 35, 36, and 38. Unlike 39, these transfers had come when it was still convenient to fill the gaps with loose manuscripts: in 14 she gathered fascicle sheets that had become dislocated from their bindings, and in the other four she grouped fascicle sheets that had never been bound and a few other loose manuscripts. 13 These replacements may have been organized at the same time as the packets of loose manuscripts in her own possession, for the organization was the same—by decade, with the 1860s (33, 35; 86-92) preceding the 1870s (36, 38; 93-95). What the irregularities in the Todd numbering represent is not lost manuscripts but the process of creating a separate collection whose numbering, by doubling the tens digit, was also separate. 14 In The Editing of Emily Dickinson I had been puzzled: "It is difficult to explain why the gap between 40 and 80, already there in 1891, should mark the division in manuscripts between those Lavinia had and those Mrs. Todd retained, since the split between the women did not come until 1896. But that is the way the manuscripts divided" (p. 37). The gap between 40 and 80 marked the division of manuscripts because Mabel Todd created it to do so. In 1891, four years before Austin Dickinson's death and five before Lavinia Dickinson filed suit to recover a piece of land, at a time when the two women were on good terms, Mabel Todd created a second collection and considered it to belong in her possession. Her unpublished diary for August 3, 1891, the year when she indexed the manuscripts, distinguished between collections: "I worked on the Index until I finished everything of Vinnie's except the Scraps, &amp; Everything so far copied." There followed another week of indexing—as well as further copying and classifying of poems—before she could record on August 10 that the index was done (Bingham, p. 155, n. 7). And in the index itself, which was the record of a thousand still unpublished poems, Mabel Todd wrote, "V. has 495 still unpublished." 15 The quarrel that erupted in 1896 between the Dickinsons and the Todds sealed a division of the manuscripts that had existed for five years. One may wonder why Mabel Todd's original estimate for the number of poems, exclusive of "scraps," was seven hundred, when there are several hundred more, and why, although we know of only forty fascicles, she spoke of "over sixty little manuscript volumes." The estimate of seven hundred was recorded in her journal, November 30, 1890, shortly after the publication of the first series of poems (Bingham, pp. 401-405). The number was probably accurate, for it was based on only one box of manuscripts, containing bound fascicles and some unbound sheets. In her journal she described this as "the first box submitted to me" and referred to a second that contained "scraps." The contents of the first box may be inferred from the Todd transcript patterns and from various lists that indicate poems known to her before she wrote this journal entry in November 1890. 16 The quantity implied by these records is about the same as the Todd estimate. Of the second box she wrote: "In addition to the original seven hundred, I have also about three hundred more in scraps—written on the backs of envelopes and bits here and there which are wonderful." 17 More manuscripts were to come. On February 1, 1891, her diary records that she was "looking over further MSS of Emily's" (Bingham, p. 106, n. 5). The next day she "found 'The Snake'" ("A narrow Fellow in the Grass"), a poem appearing on one of Dickinson's unbound fascicle sheets. 18 These "further MSS" must have been a third set, given Todd's explicit descriptions of the "scraps" in the second box and the completed transcription of the first. She transcribed these later manuscripts, perhaps a small group of unbound fascicle sheets, during 1891, not during the initial copying in 1887-1889. They were not part of the initial seven hundred. 19 As of May 1891 she spoke of a total of only eight hundred poems, exclusive of "scraps," but about June she apparently received another group (her journal reports her to have "looked over some more of Emily's poems.") 20 These she hurried to copy before completion of the index in early August. She was to receive yet more manuscripts—in her words to T. W. Higginson (August 24, 1891): "a fresh box of Emily's 'scraps'" (Bingham, p. 160). These were more of a class of manuscripts that on August 3, in the diary entry we have seen, was regarded as "Vinnie's" but that, in time, ended up in Todd's possession. When Mabel Todd stopped working on the poems, her numbers stood as 1-38, 40, 80-95, 97-98, with additional envelopes unnumbered. 21 In all, over sixty units. During the lawsuit she referred to them as "over sixty little manuscript volumes." 22 Like other testimony in this suit, hers was not always accurate. In this instance she generalized loosely, citing the part for the whole. There were only forty fascicles that Dickinson had bound, but, in addition, there were more than twenty editorial groups that included unbound fascicle sheets, worksheets, and miscellaneous copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reconstruction From these manuscripts, the facsimile edition reproduces 1147 poems: 814 of them in bound gatherings, 333 on unbound fascicle sheets. Although no fascicles are missing, a few manuscripts are missing from them, 23 and a leaf was removed by Emily Dickinson from an unbound fascicle sheet. Known to be missing are five leaves and parts of a sixth, together containing part or all of eleven poems. (Typeset texts are included for these in lieu of facsimiles.) The manuscripts missing from the fascicles may yet reappear, but the unbound leaf probably will not. The poem on it, "Now I knew I lost her" (1219), was completed on the leaf remaining. Since Dickinson canceled the final lines, one may conclude that she removed the first leaf, comprised only of the earlier lines of this poem, and discarded it. 24 In reconstructing the fascicles I studied the holographs, especially characteristics of handwriting, paper, and binding, and a variety of secondary materials—nineteenth-century transcripts of the poems, the type-writers and papers used, and the diaries, journals, and correspondence of the early editors. The notebook in which in 1891 Mabel Todd recorded the first lines of poems and their packet location was valuable in restoring groupings that suffered later dislocation. A few fascicles were already disordered by 1891, and for these the transcripts, made up to four years earlier than the notebook, were particularly helpful. Some distribution problems remained unresolved at the time The Editing of Emily Dickinson was published in 1967, notably the inclusion or exclusion of the sheets comprising packets 10 and 14 at the Houghton Library. Further research resolved these problems and corrected some related misjudgments. The changes have been reported in a series of articles. 25 The Editing of Emily Dickinson did not address the sequence within a fascicle. 26 Evidence to do so does exist, and for the facsimile edition the internal order of sheets, and thus of poems, was established for each bound fascicle. (The facsimiles appear in this order, independent of the manuscript arrangement in libraries.) The most important secondary evidence was an eight-page list, now in the Amherst College Library, that Mabel Todd prepared in 1889. The list is without heading or explanation, and its purpose is not known, but Todd made it from transcripts in their fascicle order or, alternatively, in reversed order. Considerable evidence exists in the manuscripts themselves. Soiling on first and last pages, for example, often identifies the first and last sheets of a group. Various links between sheets are provided by stains and their offsets onto facing pages, matching smudge patterns, pin impressions, and manufacturing defects like paper wrinkles. Special attention was given to puncture patterns of the binding holes and to stress effects caused by opening a fascicle against the tension of a stabbed binding, for they vary within fascicles: initial sheets differ from subsequent ones in amount of curvature along the fold edge and in the direction and extent of damage to the binding holes. Usually the evidence establishing internal order was substantial, with the Todd list corroborating the physical record of the manuscripts. Further study of the Todd transcript patterns, scrambled for the packets of unbound sheets, showed Mabel Todd to have assembled these packets after she had copied the manuscripts. The patterns are scrambled because she mixed manuscripts from the first box, transcribed in 1887-1889, with manuscripts from later groups, transcribed in 1891. In arranging them by decade, the 1860s distinct from the 1870s, she also grouped manuscripts copied at different times. Her transcripts, through false starts or parts of two poems on a single transcript, link sheets that Todd subsequently put in different packets. The eight-page list she prepared in 1889, before she assembled the packets of unbound manuscripts, has several of the loose manuscripts on it, and they are separated, although later gathered. Sheets from packet 35, for example, of the same paper but with different transcript patterns, appear at different places on the list. This specific example and, in general, the relation of transcripts to holographs show the unbound manuscripts to have been disordered when Todd copied them. Packets 33, 35, 36, 38, and 86 onward were editorial groups, not Emily Dickinson's. 27 In the facsimile edition the unbound fascicle sheets are called sets to distinguish them from the fascicles. They are gathered according to paper and date, a principle prevailing in the fascicles, though in instances Dickinson mixed papers and dates. As of 1862 her practice became regular, and the uniformity carried over into the unbound sheets that followed. She continued to work with large batches of stationery through about 1866, when she stopped copying fascicle sheets for several years. In the sets a number of stains and pin impressions connect sheets that Todd had put into separate editorial groupings. Within each set no sequence belonging to the poet has been established, or is likely to be. Because she no longer bound the sheets, the physical evidence is insufficient to arrange them in a specific order. (The lack of binding would suggest that none was intended.) The facsimile arrangement is generally by variorum date and, within that, where stains and pin impressions establish links, certain sheets appear together. In one set, where the stain moves progressively through ten sheets, they are arranged in the order of the stain without regard to variorum date.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chronology The chronology of Emily Dickinson's poems may always be troublesome. Since she did not date her manuscripts, it is necessary to base the dating of her poems, to an important degree, on developments in her handwriting. Bench marks for the handwriting must be established from documents outside her poetry, principally from letters, which, although also without a date, may be assigned one because of postmarks or internal evidence of verifiable historical fact. The poems, in contrast, rarely have a historical content that aids dating. There are pitfalls in this method, to be sure. Handwriting may vary with mood and writing implement and with audience, public or private. When an important feature is proportional only—the number of open e' s compared to closed ones—single documents may not offer sufficient evidence to conclude with certainty. It is understandable that some imprecision will inhere in even systematic attempts at dating. In the variorum chronology, based on the only comprehensive study so far of the handwriting, there are examples of fascicles which, because their sheets were separated, were assigned to more than one year: 1858 and 1859; 1861 and 1862; 1862 and 1863. Problems with the variorum dating are more frequent after Dickinson stopped binding fascicle sheets about 1864. The unbound sheets were dated while in the artificial groups Mabel Todd had assembled, and variant dates, 1864-1866, were assigned to sets of matching sheets of stationery, identical in characteristics of copying and at times linked by stains and pin impressions. By the 1870s the variorum dating of unbound fascicle sheets can be erratic, with dates several years apart assigned to the poems on a single sheet. One sheet has three such dates, in chronology the reverse of their sequence on the sheet: about 1877, early 1876, and about 1873. My research for the facsimile edition, however, suggests that the variorum dating may be accurate in outline, especially before 1864, and I used this dating developed by Thomas Johnson and Theodora Ward, noting discrepancies and, after 1864, recording a range of dates for manuscripts in the sets. The fascicles do provide evidence other than handwriting for putting them in sequence. Formal aspects of these manuscript books developed over several years. Among them are the presence and display of alternative readings, underlining and quotation marks, variation in overflow technique, the number of sheets per fascicle, and the use of single leaves. For example, when she began, Emily Dickinson allowed only completed poems into the fascicles. The first unresolved reading does not appear for about a year, and there are only about a half dozen in the first ten fascicles, through about 1860. About 1861, and continuing thereafter, alternative readings became abundant: Dickinson had moved fascicle copying earlier into her poetic process. She copied poems with many alternates, some with so many that Thomas Johnson called them worksheets in effect. Her method of recording these alternates changed. As they became frequent, she first entered them somewhere near the words to which they related, but without other indication of connection. Then she began to use crosses to indicate the relationship, later dropping the alternates, like footnotes, to the end of the poem following the line she usually drew to indicate termination. Later such footnotes were written before the drawn line. Another formal feature is the use of a single leaf left from an earlier paper type. In several instances the matching leaf is among the earlier fascicles. In The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson I relinquished the Todd numbering and arranged the units chronologically with a new numbering, Fascicles 1-40, Sets 1-15. The sequence is open to refinement, notably in the later sets where the variorum dating is erratic, the quantities small, and formal differences less pronounced. In the fascicles themselves, it may be too precise to say that 18 preceded 19, both of which have similar characteristics of paper, display of alternates, and other formal aspects. They must be from about the same time. It may not be too precise, however, to say that Fascicle 17, of different paper and somewhat different characteristics, preceded both 18 and 19, one of which includes a single leaf of 17's paper type. Let us suppose, for a moment, that the forty fascicles and the fifteen sets were sequenced precisely as Dickinson assembled and bound them or, for the sets, just copied them. In the sequence we still would have to identify, say, where 1859 began or 1862 ended. That determination, in large degree, depends upon the uncertain analysis of handwriting. But even if the sequence were correct and the years were precisely calibrated across it, a dating problem would remain, one of central concern to the study of Emily Dickinson and her poetry: the relation of fascicle copying to the composition of poems. Today few worksheets survive for fascicle poems because she usually destroyed the earlier versions. The crucial question is, How close was the fascicle copying to the point of composition? There are indications that it was often close. Some worksheets that have survived are dated by the variorum as about the same time as the fascicle copy, and there is often a pattern of copies sent to friends at about the same time. That she moved fascicle copying earlier into her poetic process, so that alternates abound as if in a worksheet, might also suggest that the two states were close. Dickinson scholarship has generally assumed they were, though some scholars have questioned the assumption as well as the dating of specific poems. 28 Certainly some lag is to be expected. Dickinson did not compose onto the fascicle sheets. Even those whose compositional state might be called "worksheet" do not have the physical appearance of one, for, like other fascicle sheets, they were copied with care sometime after the initial act of composition. Seventeen poems were copied twice, ten of them into fascicles or sets of different years. At times the repetition might be ascribed to substantial variation between the two entries: she was still at work on the poem. In other instances there is little or no textual difference despite a lapse of years. Two examples are poems 174 and 259, each copied twice, two years apart but with little or no change. They suggest that Dickinson worked out of a pool of manuscripts— rather than, at the other extreme, poem after poem onto fascicle sheets —and that the pool included manuscripts from several years. This inference is supported by a few other poems known to have been in existence years before they were entered into the fascicles. In 1853 Emily Dickinson sent "On this wondrous sea" (4) to Susan Gilbert, then in Manchester, N. H.; five years later she copied it into the first fascicle she constructed. About 1861 she sent a stanza from "It will be Summer—eventually" (342) to Samuel Bowles; the next year she entered the full poem into a fascicle, the particular stanza differing slightly. In 1861 she sent "A Burdock—clawed my Gown" (229) to her brother Austin as political commentary; three years later she copied it with a few changes onto a manuscript in Set 6. If we had the destroyed versions of Dickinson's poems, we could trace in complete detail the compositional history of the fascicles and, thus, her poetic development. The evidence remaining suggests that the pool of manuscripts was mixed in date, with some close to the time of fascicle construction but others up to several years old. At her death a few manuscripts from these early years, still not copied onto fascicle sheets, remained in her possession: one each from 1859, 1860, and 1861; about six from 1862; a dozen or so from 1864-1866. They are like sediment at the bottom of the pool. Emily Dickinson's activity relating to the fascicles, 1858-1864, is tabulated in Fig. 1. For each year it shows the number of poems she copied onto fascicle sheets, the number of leaves copied, and the number of fascicles bound. 29 A graph of this activity is provided in Fig. 2. The number of poems for 1862 is extraordinary. Twenty of the forty fascicles may be assigned to that year alone. Do the fascicles and leaves increase because Dickinson's productivity suddenly increased and she was working hard at fascicle construction to keep up? Or is there a misleading increase in poems because of an increase in copying and binding? There is some difficulty in accepting that even a facile poet suddenly wrote, on the average, a poem a day, not only writing poems but also copying them onto fascicle sheets, and that neither before nor after is there any activity similar in scope. If the number of poems in 1862 reflects an increase in copying, as distinct from composition, it would suggest that, although Dickinson had been copying fascicle sheets since 1858, there was a new resolve in 1862 to organize her poetry. This activity coincided with her correspondence with Higginson setting up the scholar-preceptor relationship. Fig. 1: Fascicle Activity, 1858-1864 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 Poems copied 57 92 67 78 378 134 27 Leaves copied 21 36 29 47 236 79 16 Fascicles bound 2 5 2 4 20 6 1 It also coincided with a new regularity in fascicle construction. Earlier she had organized them in a desultory fashion, mixing papers and dates by using sheets copied previously. In 1858, for example, she made two fascicles and left two additional sheets copied but unbound until 1859, when she bound them with two sheets from the later year. There was a spurt of copying in 1859, and she used a large batch of paper for it. During 1860 she again bound only two fascicles, again leaving additional sheets to be bound with later ones in 1861, when most of the fascicles were mixed in paper and many in date. This pattern could indicate, not insufficient poems, but a slowness in bringing poems to completion (there were no alternative readings in the earliest fascicles and only a few in the next ones) and an indifference as to when fascicles were completed. If so, by 1862 Emily Dickinson could have had a significant number of poems in her pool and, in that year, perhaps spurred on by the correspondence with Higginson, set in vigorously to organizing them, now letting poems enter the fascicles trailing many alternates. She knew that she would be working in high volume, for she used large batches of stationery, only three or four kinds for most of the activity of 1862. After using four sheets per fascicle in the early ones, followed by an erratic increase, she now settled into a norm of six sheets each. Except for the single leaves used for completion of a poem, she no longer mixed paper types, for she stopped leaving sheets copied but unbound. She did not return to this practice until she approached 1863. As she neared the end of this round of copying and binding, she also returned to smaller groups of stationery: fascicles 38, 39, and 40 have individual paper types unique in the fascicles. A similar "backlog" of poems may have developed between the end of fascicle binding in 1864 and the copying of the unbound sets that followed (Sets 5-7). During most of 1864 and 1865 Dickinson was in Cambridge under the care of a physician for her eyes. He forbade her to use pen and ink, and she appears to have followed his advice. Her datable documents during this time are in pencil. 30 These sets, however, are in ink and may not have been copied until near the end of the period (1864-1866). Handwriting characteristics appear to bear this out, especially change in the word the which, having been stable for some time, is altered as of Set 5. When she did copy the poems of 1864 and 1865, she obtained large quantities of paper again, using only three kinds before again stopping for several years. For the sheets copied in the early 1870s, there were no large batches of stationery, sometimes only one sheet of a kind. Some sheets are tablet style, carrying but one poem each. Dickinson's copying appears to have been desultory, as it was before 1862, but she managed to transcribe over sixty poems in the early seventies. Although not copied until then, some of them may have been written during the interval 1867-1870, when there is a decline in datable poems similar to that in 1860-1861 ( Poems [1955], III, 1201). This interpretation of the relation of composition to fascicle copying is not a conclusion, but a hypothesis for explaining the shape of Dickinson's poetic activity. So far, it fits the evidence, some of which points to fascicle entry close to the time of composition, some to later entry. The exact balance of the two, and how it may apply to specific poems, is not yet known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Purposes The fascicles, although they may have served as surrogate publication for a poet who never willingly consented to print, were constructed for herself. Emily Dickinson probably felt the need for an audience out-side her domestic scene, but she did not prepare the fascicles for such an audience, nor for publication. The manuscript books record many poems in a state of incompletion, whereas when Dickinson went "public" with a copy to friends, she would produce a fair copy, all alternates resolved. Moreover, the display of alternates in the fascicles is often confusing, with no indication of the words to which they relate, or with indistinct indication. In her earliest copying, she did not even mark the division between poems. Although she developed clearer ways of recording poems, she did not return to fix those she had already done. She did return to revise poems, however, usually in pencil, turning some near completion into a state closer to a worksheet. Books of simple construction, without an apparatus to assist in finding poems, the fascicles nevertheless gave her a more orderly record of poems, whatever their state of development, a source for subsequent copies, and a place where, in browsing or in making copies, she could resume the poetic process. Whatever she may have felt about publication and however the fascicles may have satisfied a longing to record her achievement publicly, they were private documents, copied for her own uses. The disorder that fascicle sheets forestalled may be seen in the "scraps" of the later years. When she did not copy such sheets and destroy the previous versions, her poems are found on hundreds of odds and ends—brown paper bags, magazine clippings, discarded envelopes and letters, the backs of recipes. Because as quantity increases browsing becomes an ineffective means of finding a specific item, the simple order of the fascicles must have become troublesome. About 1864 she stopped binding, although she continued to copy fascicle sheets that served the same functions as the bound units: a more orderly record of poems in whatever state of completion, a source for subsequent copies, and a place where she could re-enter the process of composition. By then she had over eight hundred poems in forty fascicles and may have found unbound sheets easier to browse. She bound no fascicle sheets thereafter. She did, after a break, copy more of them in the 1870s, perhaps with a lingering sense that she could yet get control of her poetry in the only way, barring publication, that she had developed. A few years later she gave herself up to the accumulating mass of manuscripts of assorted sizes, shapes, and materials. 31 As a last concern, we may consider whether Emily Dickinson organized the fasicles and sets as artistic gatherings, careful constructs governed by theme, imagery, narrative and dramatic movement, or similar principle. Such a circumstance would enhance Dickinson's achievement by enlarging the scope of her artistry. It would give context to poems and thus help to determine their meaning. Perhaps most important, it would address a problem fundamental to Dickinson criticism—how to deal systematically with a large body of short poems. 32 Critical attempts to find coherence in Dickinson's nearly eighteen hundred poems, to avoid the fragmentation of the individual poem without also sacrificing it, have yielded conflicting conclusions. 33 As a higher level of artistry, the fascicles would reduce selection biased by a particular critical thesis. Emily Dickinson made the choices, and they would be biased only by what her intentions had been in organizing them, by her methods in doing so, and by date (for there is always a terminus ad quem to the selection). This possibility, though attractive, is not supported by the developmental history of the fascicles. They were private documents with practical uses, gatherings of convenience for poems finished or unfinished. However inconvenient they became, they served Dickinson as her workshop put in order and, for the years they cover, are a comprehensive record, almost complete, of the poems in her possession—a condition at variance with their being forty careful selections for artistic purposes. Binding followed copying, sometimes years later mixing sheets from different years. That such sheets were copied in different years suggests that no fascicle-level order governed their preparation. In one fascicle the manuscripts were copied in 1858, 1861, and 1862, with one of them folded as if first intended for mailing. After 1864 she continued to make fascicle sheets but was not concerned enough about preserving order to bind them. Other aspects of their preparation argue against the fascicles as units constructed on some aesthetic principle. Dickinson used individual sheets of two leaves, not quires of leaves as in a notebook. If she had selected poems and arranged them into a meaningful order and then copied them onto fascicle sheets, the poems would have fallen across the four-page sheets without regard to spatial constraints. Instead we see her fitting poems to space. Her short poems (under eight lines), for example, would have appeared at various places on pages, but almost all were placed at the bottom to fill in after the preceding poem. Her longer poems, those taking three or four pages, would have started on any of the four pages of a Dickinson sheet if they had been part of a prior order (or, for that matter, if they had been randomly selected out of the mass before her). But almost all (19 of 22) began on the first page of a sheet, a point at which, conscious of the limits of her sheets, she knew there would be space to complete such a poem. Twice she began on the second page, once misjudging and running off the sheet onto an extra leaf. Once she began on the third page, also overrunning the limits of the sheet. None of the longer poems began on the fourth page. This pattern would not occur unless, working with the sheet as her unit, Dickinson had been fitting poems to space. 34 Moreover, if she had been copying an ordered set of poems, one whose artistic structure were independent of the physical structure onto which transcribed, the final pages of the fascicles would not be filled so uniformly. Such a set of poems might always begin on the first page of a fascicle, but it would end on any of the four pages of the final sheet. But thirty-seven of the forty fascicles have poems on the final page. Once Dickinson stopped on the next-to-last page; in the other two instances she added a single leaf at the end. One of these was for overflow (verso always blank); the other (verso also blank) had been copied separately, addressed, and folded as if for mailing. There are other possibilities for deliberate design in the fascicles. One is that Dickinson created a structure as she proceeded, selecting and copying a given poem before moving on to the next one. Another is that she selected a group of related poems and then fitted them to paper —at the end of the fascicle returning the extras to her pool of manuscripts. Both processes, and combinations of them, would be subject to larger degrees of chance and to the restrictions of multiple coordinates. In each, to a degree determined by the precise assumptions of how she proceeded, the particular sequence of poems would become less important than the group as a whole. The coherence—to take a point from Marshall McLuhan—might be more global than linear. Severely linear aspects, such as precise balance, unbroken progression, orderly recurrence, and finely placed echoes and anticipations, would seem unlikely. It might be difficult, for example, to see the poet two-thirds of the way through a fascicle selecting as the next poem one that had not only the proper content for its immediate context but also the right length and, moreover, was connected in some tightly organized fashion with a poem or poems several pages earlier. The thematic, narrative, or dramatic structure discerned according to such possibilities, if any, would be looser than criticism has often assumed or perhaps would find attractive. If the fascicles are not artistic arrangements, aesthetic order ought not appear in them, yet there are suggestions, even to the skeptical, that it does. One fascicle has a lot of flower poems; 35 imagery and theme do recur; and there are provocative sequences: "These are the days when Birds come back" (130) followed by "Besides the Autumn poets sing" (131); "They shut me up in Prose" (613) followed by "This was a Poet" (448). Even in the later sets we find "The Heart is the Capital of the Mind" (1354) in the same group with "The Mind lives on the Heart" (1355). Are these to be ascribed to chance? Perhaps not, but the capacity of the human mind to find order is large: order can be apparent even in randomness. The tune, as Dickinson reminds us, may not be in the tree but in ourselves. Certainly critical discussions of the fascicles have reached divergent conclusions, with one reader finding a single "blueprint" for them all and another reader finding no general model but a different basis for coherence in each (Miller, pp. 247-288; Sletto, p. 220). So, too, classical balance has been discerned between the opening and ending of a fascicle lacking its first two sheets, 36 narrative unity in the fascicle with those sheets, 37 and detailed design in packets 33 and 36, two of the artificial groups Mabel Todd assembled (O'Keefe, pp. 8-11; Sletto, pp. 171-216). The poems, of course, are not unrelated. They have a single author out of whose particular experience, interests, concerns, and techniques they have emerged. In any combination, they have more presumptive coherence than a random selection of just any poems. As Richard B. Sewall in considering the question of the fascicles has said, "One difficulty is that almost any random groupings of eighteen or twenty of ED's stronger poems can be shown to have similar coherence, so recurrent are her major themes, images, and symbolic structures" (II, 538, n. 4). Such coherence may be even more manifest in the fascicles since they limit the poems to certain portions of Dickinson's life. The fascicle with many flower poems was the first one assembled; nothing in it can be later than about 1858. Subsequent fascicles may include poems from a broader period of time, the exact span depending upon the crucial relation of fascicle copying to composition, but nothing can be later than the date of copying. Constrained by time, the fascicles may present the poems, recurrent in their concerns and strategies, in gatherings that appear to have design.</field>

The dating of poems also follows this edition, modified as indicated. 2 Ruth Miller, The Poetry of Emily Dickinson (1968). 3 Arlo Duane Sletto, Emily Dickinson's Poetry: The Fascicles (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of New Mexico, 1975); Carmine A.

R. W. Franklin, 2 vols. (1981). 5 Although there are poems about poetry as well as several statements about poetry in her letters, ED left no record about the fascicles beyond a few indefinite, if suggestive, references. "This is my letter to the World" (441) begins a famous poem in one fascicle. Perhaps more suggestive, because Lavinia Dickinson found the poems in her sister's bureau, are lines from another famous fascicle poem (675): "But this—in Lady's Drawer / Make Summer—When the Lady lie / In Ceaseless Rosemary." Such references, however, do not establish the point. 6 Our earliest glimpse of fascicle structure may come when the manuscripts were still in the hands of her sister-in-law, Susan Dickinson, to whom Lavinia Dickinson first turned for help in publishing them. In reading through the manuscripts, Susan Dickinson would mark poems with a letter ( D, F, L, N, P, S , and W ), perhaps a topic indicator. Her markings appear to coincide with fascicle groupings. 7 Mabel Loomis Todd, unpublished diary, August 2, 1891. The diaries and journals of Mabel Todd are now in the Todd-Bingham Archive at Yale University. Excerpts from them have been published in Millicent Todd Bingham, Ancestors' Brocades: The Literary Debut of Emily Dickinson (1945). 8 Mabel Loomis Todd, "Preface," in Poems by Emily Dickinson , ed. T. W. Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, Second Series (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1891), p. 4. 9 Superior Court of Hampshire County, Northampton, Massachusetts, 1898, docket nos. 125 and 193. 10 ED began using four sheets per fascicle in 1858-1859. In 1860-1861 the number increased, somewhat erratically, but about 1862 she arrived at a common pattern of six sheets each. This norm prevailed, with little variation, until she stopped binding about 1864. The smallest number of sheets per fascicle is four, the largest seven and a half. 11 See also Franklin, pp. 36-37. The notebook is in the Amherst College Library. 12 In The Editing of Emily Dickinson , pp. 79-80, I assumed that, because packet 80 had a split transcript pattern, it had been separated with part considered to be 39 and part 80. Further study indicates that Mabel Todd transcribed packet 80 down to "One Sister have I in the house" (14), to her an objectionable poem, and later, in 1891, completed the transcription of the packet at about the time she transferred it. 13 To keep them together for Lavinia Dickinson, Mabel Todd may have been the person who bound these artificial groups with a metal fastener. 14 The vacancy at 96 was probably caused by movement of manuscripts within the Todd portion, for Mabel Todd continued to rearrange them. 15 Inside the back cover of the Todd notebook, now in the Amherst College Library. 16 These records include publication in Poems (1890), transcripts with particular markings on them by Arlo Bates, T. W. Higginson, and Mabel Todd herself, and an eight-page list she made of poems in 1889. The contents may also be inferred from the list of poems Lavinia Dickinson wanted included in the second series and another list that, along with Lavinia's, Mabel Todd took to Boston on April 8, 1891. These lists are in the Amherst College Library. 17 Todd, journal, November 30, 1890, quoted in Bingham, p. 405. Mabel Todd kept returning to this box of scraps during preparation of the second series in 1891, writing to Higginson in May that she had recently "begun to arrange and copy" them and would include a few in the new volume, and in July that some of the "box of 'scraps' in pencil" were gems and that a superb poem (664) had been "found only among the rough and penciled scraps—that box is a mine of wealth." See Todd to Higginson, May 18, July 22, and July 24, 1891, quoted in Bingham, pp. 130-131, 143-144, and 145-146 respectively. 18 Todd, diary, February 3, 1891, quoted in Bingham, p. 106, n. 5. The entry reads: "Yesterday I found 'The Snake.'" 19 Their transcript patterns match those of other poems known to have been copied in 1891 and their publication differs from the seven hundred. None was in the first series. A few, including "The Snake," Mabel Todd was able to include in the second series, then in progress, but in the main that volume derived from the seven hundred also. The "further MSS" and later manuscripts were heavily used, however, in 1896 in the third series. Most were not published until Millicent Todd Bingham brought out Bolts of Melody: New Poems of Emily Dickinson (1945). 20 Mabel Todd gave the estimate of eight hundred poems on May 2, 1891, in a lecture that Charles E. L. Wingate reported in The Critic (May 9, 1891); see Bingham, p. 128. The Todd journal entry for June 16, 1891, is quoted in Bingham, p. 131. In it she remarked, "I have looked over some more of Emily's poems, although all the selection has been made for the second volume." She may have been referring to more manuscripts. 21 Mabel Todd placed the "scraps" in envelopes which her daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, numbered 96, 99-112. These envelopes are now in the Todd-Bingham Archive in the Yale University Library. 22 Superior Court of Hampshire County, Northampton, Massachusetts, 1898, docket no. 125. The defendant's answer, in which this description appeared, was filed December 14, 1896. Mabel Todd repeated the description later; see Bingham, p. 17. 23 Mabel Todd, in charge throughout of an extraordinary sequence of events relating to packet 80, now appears to have been the person who mutilated it in 1891. Other disruption of the manuscripts occurred, without loss, before 1891, but most disorder and most of the manuscript loss occurred later in the portion held successively by Lavinia Dickinson, Susan Dickinson, and Martha Dickinson Bianchi. Some disruption appears to have been deliberate, as several sheets were cut apart with scissors and one cut leaf was pasted against another piece of paper, as if in a scrap book. But there is little to suggest an attempt at suppressing poems. Martha Dickinson Bianchi found two of the missing poems appropriate enough to publish in 1929. Except possibly for "Rearrange a 'Wife's' affection!" (1737), which contains images of sex change, and "If ever the lid gets off my head" (1727), which alludes to loss of sense, the other missing poems that she did not publish appear unobjectionable in image or reference: "A curious Cloud surprised the Sky" (1710) and "A Pit —but Heaven over it" (1712). Martha Bianchi is known to have sold, or given away, some Dickinson manuscripts during the 1920s and the 1930s. The missing ones may yet reappear. 24 The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson , I, 305-306, and II, 949-950, includes two blank leaves, in two of the bound fascicles. Physical characteristics suggest that she copied a full sheet in both instances. The poems on the missing leaves are not known, since Mabel Todd appears not to have transcribed, published, or indexed them. ED may have removed these leaves, but it would have been extraordinary for her to have done so. They may have become accidentally lost before the Todd-Graves transcripts of 1887-1889, an event perhaps even more unusual. Or they may have been suppressed by another person. There is precedence for suppression before 1891, but it, too, was rare. 25 R. W. Franklin, "Three Additional Dickinson Manuscripts," American Literature , 50 (March 1978), 109-116; "Emily Dickinson's Packet 27 (and 80, 14, and 6)," Harvard Library Bulletin , 27 (July 1979), 342-348; "The Dickinson Packet 14—and 20, 10, and 26," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 73 (1979), 348-355; and "The Houghton Library Dickinson Manuscript 157," Harvard Library Bulletin , 28 (July 1980), 245-257. 26 Readers have sometimes assumed otherwise. The logic and evidence argued only for a particular group of manuscripts, not their sequence, but the distinction was perhaps not clear enough. 27 Some manuscript movement among the editorial groups can be charted, as Mabel Todd continued to rearrange manuscripts. She also included in the groups manuscripts that were not fascicle sheets. Some she removed herself; Jay Leyda, who cataloged the Amherst collection, removed others; The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson excludes the remainder. 28 See, for example, Richard B. Sewall, The Life of Emily Dickinson , 2 vols. (1974), II, 412; Rebecca Patterson, "On Dating Dickinson's Poems," American Notes &amp; Queries , 12 (February 1974), 84-86; and Margaret H. Freeman, "Introduction," in Rebecca Patterson, Emily Dickinson's Imagery (1979), pp. ix-x. 29 Figs. 1 and 2 are based on Fascicles 1-40 and the related fascicle sheets in Sets 1-4. A graph based on Poems (1955), III, 1200-1201, would have a similar shape. 30 Thomas H. Johnson, "Establishing a Text: The Emily Dickinson Papers," Studies in Bibliography , 5 (1952-53), 27. Compare The Letters of Emily Dickinson , ed. Thomas H. Johnson and Theodora Ward, 3 vols. (1958), II, 429-446. 31 Jay Leyda has suggested (Amherst College Library, Emily Dickinson Collection) that certain of these manuscripts may be fascicle sheets, written in pencil in the 1880s. However, a study of their paper and of their copying and folding suggests that, while there may be vestiges of the fascicle idea, these manuscripts are closer to working drafts and miscellaneous copies. 32 David T. Porter, The Art of Emily Dickinson's Early Poetry (1966), pp. 16-17, has stated the problem succinctly: "Thoughtful readers of Emily Dickinson's poetry have pursued a variety of approaches to the body of work in an effort to discover coherence, so that the poetry may be discussed within some sort of rational framework. . . . Whether there is an organizing principle to be found, or whether each poem is a fragment, and the canon a random scattering of fragments out of which one is free to make his own mosaic, constitutes the fundamental problem." 33 Porter, pp. 16-20, and Sletto, pp. 1-8, survey some of the divergent attempts at coherence. Compare also George Monteiro, "The One and Many Emily Dickinsons," American Literary Realism , 7 (Spring 1974), 137-141. 34 In the bound fascicles, poems run over between pages 1 and 2 twice as often (131 times) as they do between either pages 2 and 3 (66 times) or pages 3 and 4 (65 times); they overflow from page 4 onto an extra piece of paper only 11 times. ED tried to avoid overflow and fitted poems to space accordingly. As the decline for run-on between pages 2 and 3 suggests, she may also have been affected by the crossing from one leaf to the other— lest they become separated or folded backwards (both events occurred.) 35 David Higgins, Portrait of Emily Dickinson: The Poet and Her Prose (1967), p. 79, points out that fourteen of the twenty-two poems in packet 82 are about flowers. The fascicle has been discussed in Sletto, pp. 17-44. 36 In packet 6, in an unpublished study shown to me by its author, Martha O'Keefe. 37 In packet 27, in Sletto, pp. 69-129. I am responsible for some of the confusion regarding packets 6 and 27, as I had proposed in The Editing of Emily Dickinson that the two sheets should be shifted. Subsequent resolution of the problems associated with packet 27 indicated that, on the basis of physical characteristics of the holographs, the two sheets should remain in packet 6. See Franklin, "Emily Dickinson's Packet 27 (and 80, 14, and 6), Harvard Library Bulletin , 27 (July 1979), 342-348.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most scholarly editors, regardless of the nature or date of the material they work with, recognize that they are participating in a tradition extending back to antiquity; they realize that the activity of "textual criticism," whether called by that name or not, was for centuries concerned with the establishment of the texts of ancient Greek and Roman writings and of the Old and New Testaments and that the development of their discipline is therefore tied to the history of those works. Even if they are not familiar with the details of that history, they know that Aristarchus and other librarians at Alexandria in the third and second centuries B.C. attempted to determine what was authentic and what was spurious in the texts of the manuscripts they assembled; that the Renaissance humanists (among them Poggio, Politian, Aldus, and Erasmus) were particularly concerned with locating, establishing, and disseminating texts in the ancient languages; that Richard Bentley in the early eighteenth century made contributions to the textual study of several Latin authors and proposed a text of the New Testament based on the earliest manuscripts; and that Karl Lachmann, a century later, provided the fullest exposition up to that time of the genealogical approach and is therefore sometimes regarded as the father of modern textual criticism. They probably also know that A.E. Housman had some sharp things to say about the editorial practices of many of his predecessors, comments that emerged from important methodological considerations. But unless their own work involves classical or biblical or medieval texts, they have in all likelihood not followed closely the nineteenth-and twentieth-century history of textual study in these areas. The explanation is not simply the growing specialization of scholarship but the feeling that the textual criticism of manuscript texts produced centuries after their authors' deaths has little, if any, relevance to textual work on printed texts published during their authors' lifetimes. The foolishness of this view is evident to anyone who has read in the editorial literature concerning both ancient and modern texts, for the same issues keep turning up, and some writers seem to be rediscovering, with effort, what was thoroughly discussed in a different field years before. By not familiarizing themselves with the textual criticism of classical, biblical, and medieval literature, textual scholars of more recent literature are cutting themselves off from a voluminous body of theoretical discussion and the product of many generations of experience. And by not keeping up with developments in the editing of post-medieval writings, students of earlier works are depriving themselves of the knowledge of significant advances in editorial thinking. Whereas in the classical and biblical fields textual scholarship was at the forefront, both in prestige and in achievement, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the leadership in theoretical debate about textual matters has in more recent years passed to the field of Renaissance and later literature in English. If textual scholars of these later writings have never quite been accorded by their colleagues the same position of centrality that editors of the classics had long held in their field, 1 there can be no doubt that the extensive, and sometimes acrimonious, debate provoked by Greg's famous essay on copy-text, 2 and its extension by Fredson Bowers and then by the Center for Editions of American Authors, 3 have caused textual and editorial questions to be of serious concern to a larger portion of the scholars in the field than they had ever been before. Although the phrase "modern editing" in my title of course refers elliptically to the editing of modern literature, there is some justice in taking it at the same time to mean, more literally, the latest developments in editing. As a contribution toward what I hope will become increased communication among scholars in all these fields, I should like to offer in what follows a few reflections on the relations between textual work on early or medieval manuscripts and that on later printed texts. Although I do not propose a systematic survey of the history of classical, biblical, and medieval textual criticism, 4 I believe that some purpose is served by bringing together, in this context, references to a number of the significant discussions. What I trust will become clear in the process is that editors of ancient and modern materials have much more to learn from one another than they have generally recognized. Equally revealing, if rather depressing, is the fact that many of their areas of confusion are the same: some of the questions that have been endlessly and inconclusively debated—and often, it must be said, illogically argued as well —are identical in both fields. In either case, the essential point is the relevance each field has for the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I It should not be surprising that all textual scholarship is related, for the same activities are involved, regardless of the diversity of the materials. One must decide whether to produce a diplomatic—that is, unaltered—text of a single document or a critical text, which is a new text that incorporates the results of editorial judgment regarding variant readings and errors. One must assemble the relevant or potentially relevant documents (handwritten, typed, or printed), then find out in what ways their texts differ by collating them, then attempt to determine the relationships among the texts, and finally, if the edition is to be critical, construct a new text by choosing among variant readings and by making conjectures where errors seem to be present in all texts. These stages are interrelated: the kind of thinking one brings to the task of determining relationships among texts, for example, will obviously have a bearing on the decisions made at the next stage. Although these two stages are not entirely separable, textual discussions do, in practice, often emphasize one or the other; and I think it is fair to say that perhaps the principal distinction between the body of writing concerned with editing the classics and that dealing with editing modern literature is their differing emphases in this regard. Editors of the earlier material have access to no authorial manuscripts and must contend with copies an unknown number of steps removed (and often many centuries away) from those originals, and such copies sometimes exist in the hundreds, or even—as with the Greek New Testament—the thousands. The task of working out the relationships among the texts of these documents is indeed formidable, and it is natural that a great deal of the thought and writing about editing ancient texts 5 has concentrated on this stage of the editorial process. What has traditionally been called "textual criticism" —or, more recently, "textual analysis"—is this attempt to fix the relationship of the surviving documentary witnesses; and though many of the theories of textual criticism have entailed certain assumptions about how the editor's critical text should be constructed, the focus of attention has normally been not on the "editorial" phase (the actual selection or emendation of readings) but on the prior analysis of the texts that results in the assignment of relationships among them. 6 Methodological writings about the editing of post-medieval literature, on the other hand, have reversed this emphasis. Although relationships among the texts from this period are by no means always clear-cut, the dimensions of the problem are often significantly different: manuscripts in the author's hand, copies made directly from them, printed editions set from such documents (and perhaps proofread by the author), and later editions during the author's lifetime (perhaps set from copies of the earlier editions annotated by the author) are the characteristic materials. Editorial theorists concerned with this period have therefore not been required to give as much thought to the question of establishing relationships among texts and instead have concentrated their attention on the choice and treatment of a "copy-text." Choosing a copy-text is of course dependent on knowing the relationships among the texts; the central problem, however, is not the process of establishing those relationships but of defining the authorial intention that is to be reflected in the critical text, since often more than one document exists that is directly associated with the author. The term "textual criticism" can be used broadly to designate the evaluation of textual witnesses for writings of any period; but its traditional, and more restricted, application to the study of ancient manuscripts is appropriate, for it refers to the kind of analysis that has bulked largest in textual work on those manuscripts. In classical textual criticism, these basic operations have generally been referred to as recensio and emendatio , and the distinction between the two points up another contrast with textual scholarship of later literature. Recensio refers to the process of establishing the archetype, or the latest common ancestor of all surviving manuscripts, insofar as it can be established from the evidence in those manuscripts, which are the only witnesses to the tradition. The particular decisions made about individual variant readings in the construction of this archetype depend, at least in part, on the relationships that have been postulated among the manuscripts; the practice of stemmatics—of constructing genealogical trees to show manuscript relationships—is therefore also sometimes called "recensionism." And whether or not one aspires to a system that eliminates judgment in the construction and use of the stemmata, the fact is that ultimately judgment will have been involved in the attempt to choose the wording of the archetype from among the variant readings. Swings in scholarly fashion toward, and away from, the use of critical judgment—along with the associated tendency to favor, or disapprove of, eclecticism—must be looked at later; but the point here is not whether a single text is principally adhered to in producing the new recension but the fact that the recension is defined as being limited to readings present in the witnesses (or obvious corrections of them). It is the next stage, emendatio , in which the editor can engage in conjecture to rectify what appear to be errors in all preserved texts. 7 Editorial discussion dealing with post-medieval works, in contrast, generally takes the term "emendation" to refer to any alterations introduced by the editor into a particular documentary text (the one chosen as "copy-text"), whether the source of those alterations are other texts or the editor's own ingenuity. It is perhaps natural that this usage should have prevailed among editors of modern works, since they often have an author's manuscript or a text only one or two steps from it to use as a copy-text, and all their alterations may then be seen as corrections to that single documentary text; editors in the earlier manuscript tradition, on the other hand, normally have no such text to choose, and the process of arriving at what might be regarded as the counterpart is a major undertaking in itself, to be accomplished before one can begin to think about how that text departs from what the author must have intended to say. In any event, however the difference in usage came about, it should be clear that both groups of editors are talking about the same categories of editorial intervention—alterations based on readings present in one or more of the documents and alterations emerging from the editor's own conjecture. It should further be evident that any approach or vocabulary suggesting that the latter are more conjectural than the former is delusory. Of course, a reading adopted from one of the documents may be a striking reading that the editor would not have thought of or dared introduce independently, but the decision to consider it as worthy of acceptance into the critical text is still an act of conjecture, always entailing the potential danger that the reading is accorded too much credence by the mere fact of its existence in one of the documents. To regard the choice among variants as "recension," defined as establishing "what must or may be regarded as transmitted" (Maas), and then to label further editorial alteration as "emendation" or "conjectural emendation," would seem to overemphasize the objectivity of the first and to imply a greater distance between the two than in fact exists. The recension, after all, is a conclusion resulting from scholarly judgment or conjecture—except, of course, when only one text survives or (theoretically) when all surviving texts are identical. Even when the archetype appears to be the text of one of the extant manuscripts, judgment regarding individual variants is still involved in reaching that decision. To think of "what must or may be regarded as transmitted" as a single text, when variant texts survive, is to engage in conjecture; and some of the "conjectural emendations" that an editor thinks of may attain to a higher degree of certainty than some of the choices that are made among variant readings in the documents. I do not believe that editors in any field would disagree with this point, despite the implications of the language sometimes used. The fact that the terminology employed by editors of classical and of modern texts diverges somewhat is not important, so long as both groups of editors recognize that they are dealing with the same fundamental questions and so long as they are not misled by the superficial suggestiveness of some of the terms. As the division of the editorial process into recensio and emendatio makes clear, editors of ancient texts are normally concerned with producing critical editions—editions, that is, containing texts that are different, as a result of the editors' intervention, from any of the documentary texts now existing. Editors of printed texts from the last five hundred years have also been engaged for the most part with this kind of edition: the extensive discussion in the wake of Greg's "Rationale," for instance, has concentrated on critical editions. Yet in the exchange of views that has increasingly been taking place in recent years between editors of modern literature and editors of statesmen's papers, some of the so-called "historical" editors have questioned the value of critical texts, or at least of texts that are "eclectic" in incorporating readings from two or more documents. It is easy to see why a historian editing letters and journals in the hand of a particular statesman would think primarily of a diplomatic edition, and similarly understandable that an editor of an ancient Greek text surviving in much later manuscripts would probably wish to construct a new text attempting to restore the author's words. But the difference between the two situations does not really rest on the different nature of the materials: there are different goals involved, the aim in the former instance being the reproduction of the content of a given document and in the latter being the reconstruction of what the author of a text intended to say. Both approaches are applicable to any material: documents containing ancient Greek texts, for instance, can obviously be treated as entities in their own right, with texts to be exactly reproduced, as manifestations of particular moments in the history of the pieces of writing involved; or they can be regarded as evidence to be used in reconstructing a text nearer its author's intentions than any of the surviving texts manages to come. Historians may more often find themselves producing diplomatic texts of particular documents (the contents of which were often not intended for publication), and scholars of literature (both ancient and modern) may more often be engaged in constructing critical texts of works (ordinarily finished pieces of writing—whether "literary" or not—intended for public dissemination). But each group should recognize the value of both approaches and understand how they are related to one another. This point would seem to be so elementary and obvious as not to need stating; but unfortunately some textual controversies have arisen through a failure to keep in mind the most basic distinctions and to appreciate the place each editorial undertaking occupies in the large framework that encompasses all textual work in all fields. One historical editor has gone so far recently as to make this statement: "To what uses literary critics may put bastard documents is for them to say, but the saying of the same will not likely change the historical discipline's rules of evidence and citation." 8 The narrowness and closed-mindedness of this position is astounding. In a more sophisticated form, however, this issue keeps turning up: the question of eclecticism has perennially been a point of controversy among editors of the classics as well as of modern works. 9 Some editors of modern literary works, who well understand the value of critical texts, have nevertheless argued against combining into a single text readings that reflect different stages of authorial revision. There is nothing wrong in principle, of course, with the position that authorially revised texts may at times be best handled by preparing separate critical editions of each version. But the mistake that sometimes follows is the belief that no variant from one version can be incorporated into another. That injunction would naturally be proper if one were producing a diplomatic edition of each version; but if a critical text of each version is the goal, then one must recognize that some of the variants among versions do not represent a particular stage of revision or rethinking but are precisely the kinds of corrections that the editor is already committed to inserting—without documentary authority. I make this point (which has been discussed more fully else-where) 10 in order to suggest, once again, that the distinction between adopted variant readings and conjectural emendations needs to be thought about less mechanically than it often is and to show that editors would be well advised to keep abreast of textual debate in fields other than their own. Just as editors of statesmen's papers and of modern literature stand to benefit from knowing more about the editorial thinking underlying critical editions of ancient texts, so editors of the classics (and of statesmen's papers) will find that the discussions of authorial revisions, engaged in fully by editors of modern literature, raise questions relevant for them. Further indication of these connections can be suggested by referring to three of the more recent manuals on textual criticism, published coincidentally at about the same time, James Willis's Latin Textual Criticism (1972), Martin L. West's Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique Applicable to Greek and Latin Texts (1973), and Vinton A. Dearing's Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (1974). 11 These books offer several contrasts. Willis and West, classicists and editors, address their work, as the titles indicate, to other editors of classical texts; Dearing, a professor of English who is establishing the text for the California edition of Dryden and is also working on an edition of the Greek New Testament, intends for his book to be applicable to all editorial scholarship, indeed "to the transmission in any form of any idea or complex of ideas" (p. ix). Willis, whose writing is marred by unsuccessful sarcasm, is principally occupied with restating "the many ways in which scribes were accustomed to make mistakes" (p. ix), though he prefaces that account with a brief section on "Fundamentals"; West, who writes lucidly and concisely, would claim originality largely (though not entirely) for his way of stating certain complex questions and their conventional answers and for choosing passages to illustrate his points; Dearing, who writes at greater length and with some obscurity, covers what a manual must cover but uses the occasion to set forth his own proposal for the analysis of relationships among texts. Willis's book is the narrowest and least significant of the three, focusing on scribal errors and devoting considerable space to "trial passages," on which readers are invited to exercise their ingenuity by proposing emendations (answers are provided). Dearing's experience with both ancient and modern texts (he is perhaps unique in working in both fields) and his view of textual analysis as "a completely general discipline of very wide specific applicability in the arts and social sciences" (p. 1) are encouraging signs, and one has good reason to expect his book to have broader significance than West's. 12 In my view, however, West's book is calmer, clearer, and more sensible and finally a better introduction for students from any discipline. Whether or not I am right, I hope that one point implicit in my opinion will be granted: that the interests of all who deal with texts are closely related and therefore that the sources of specific illustrations are of less moment than the basic statements and discussions of principles. A book that draws its examples from many periods and languages is not necessarily of more general applicability than one that takes all its illustrations from Greek and Latin texts; it may be, but the range of examples and even the immediate aims of the author are not the decisive tests. One vital matter commented on in all three books—and one that editors of modern literature have a particular interest in—is the role of the analysis of physical evidence in textual decisions. What has come to be known as "analytical bibliography" is crucial to the editing of texts in printed books: in order to be in a position to understand textual anomalies in a printed text, one must first have extracted as much information as possible about the printing of the work from the evidence preserved in the printed sheets themselves. As a result of the efforts of McKerrow, Pollard, Greg, Bowers, and Hinman, 13 and of those that followed their lead, editors of printed texts must now deal with such matters as the identification of compositors' habits and of the order of formes through the press. Knowing as much as one can about what happened to a particular text in the printing shop or the publisher's office puts one in a better position to recognize those features of the text that did not come from the author (or at least were not present in the copy furnished to the printer); analytical bibliography has shown time and again that much can be learned from physical evidence about the transmission of the text. The same principle obviously applies to manuscripts as well: in the case of manuscript texts not in their authors' hands, the scribe or copyist occupies the roles of publisher's editor, compositor, and pressman combined. Introductory manuals for editors of manuscripts have recognized this point to some extent in that they often contain fairly detailed comments classifying the kinds of errors that scribes were likely to make. Such "habits" are generalized ones, and less attention has been paid to uncovering the habits of particular scribes through physical evidence, including that which fixes the manuscript in time and place. This whole question enters Dearing's book in the first sentence, where we are told that textual analysis "determines the genealogical relationships between different forms of the same message" but not "the relationships between the transmitters of the different forms"—or, as he puts it in the next paragraph, "the genealogy of the variant states of a text" but not "the genealogy of their records." 14 The distinction, indeed, Dearing regards as one of his central achievements: he believes that his book "carries out to the full" the differentiation set forth in the earlier version 15 between "the genealogy of manuscript and other books as physical objects and the genealogy of the ideas or complexes of ideas that these physical objects transmit" (p. ix). It is of course quite proper to begin with this basic point; editors of all materials from all periods must recognize that the chronology of texts does not necessarily match the chronology of their physical presentation. The point is perhaps not quite such a revelation as Dearing thinks. Nevertheless, it is always good to have fundamental distinctions set forth clearly at the outset of a discussion, and one would have no cause for complaint if Dearing had not carried the point to the opposite extreme, slighting the legitimate role of physical evidence in textual study. Writers in the past, he says, have "almost always" confused the physical document with the text it carries, and he admits that "it is extremely difficult to free oneself from the bibliographical spell"; but it is a "fundamental and important" matter, he insists, "to exclude bibliographical thinking from textual analysis" (p. 15). That the valid distinction he began with could have led to this wrongheaded conclusion is unfortunate; but the problem might have been predicted from some remarks made along the way to illustrate the basic point that texts are different from their transmitters. To show that "the same record" may preserve "two or more states of a text," he cites as one illustration a poem appearing twice in an anthology (p. 14). But how is "record" being defined here? What is the physical unit? One may ask the same questions when he then says that different records may "transmit the same state of a text when they are produced by a mechanically perfect reproductive process, such as Xerox copying, and whenever it is deemed vital to preserve the text without change, as in statute books, state documents such as the Constitution of the United States, religious documents such as the Book of Common Prayer, and careful scholarly reprints of all sorts" (pp. 14-15). Xerox copying is not "mechanically perfect," if only because the size of the image is not identical with the original. Beyond that, it is no criticism of the Xerox process to say that it is not "mechanically perfect," since no system can be, if what is meant is that the reproduction is identical to the original. The reproduction is a different physical object, and therefore it is not the same thing; and most, if apparently not quite all, users of Xerox reproductions are aware of the dangers of assuming that what they see in the reproduction is precisely what they would see in the original. Furthermore, is Dearing suggesting that whenever "it is deemed vital to preserve the text without change" such preservation is achieved? Are there never errors in the reprintings of statutes, or prayer books, or "careful scholarly reprints"? Does not the acceptance of aim for fact question the need for textual scholarship at all (or any other effort to establish truth)? The serious bibliographical problem raised by these statements becomes even more evident with Dearing's next sentence: "The many identical copies produced by printing from the same setting of type, however, provided they are uniformly bound and readied for sale as a single lot, are usually counted as one record." Analytical bibliographers have been demonstrating for three-quarters of a century that surviving copies from the same setting of type (i.e., from the same edition) are not necessarily "identical" in their text—indeed, that they are frequently (or, in some periods, usually) not identical. (Whether or not they are "uniformly bound" or "readied for sale as a single lot" has nothing to do with their text.) Differences can come about either intentionally or inadvertently, through stop-press corrections and alterations between printings or through accidents that damage the type (perhaps necessitating some resetting) and deterioration of type or plates through wear. The essential point is that different copies of an edition are different physical objects and are therefore separate pieces of evidence; it is unscholarly to assume, without investigation, that they are identical, and in fact such an assumption would very often be wrong, for books of any period, even the twentieth century. If one were to regard all copies of an edition as a single "record," one would have to define "record" in a special way, for there would frequently be textual variants among particular copies of the "record." It is difficult, for example, to say what "the" text of the Shakespeare First Folio is; one might say that it is the text in Charlton Hinman's Norton Facsimile (1968)—but that work assembles from various copies of the Folio the pages representing corrected formes. No one surviving copy contains all the corrected pages, and constructing such a copy in facsimile is a task requiring scholarly judgment. Some people who work only with manuscripts (and some who work with printed books as well) think of copies of printed editions as identical, in contrast to manuscripts, each of which is expected to be different. Undeniably manuscripts and printed books are produced in fundamentally different ways; but the fact that copies of an edition are mass-produced and intended to be identical does not mean that they are actually identical. Indeed, they cannot be identical, since no two physical objects are identical in every respect; and textual differences are among the kinds of variations that occur. Printed books resemble manuscripts more than many people seem to think. These are elementary points, and Dearing (who has done a great deal of work with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English books) certainly understands them; why he fails to take them into account here is inexplicable. 16 The fact that their absence is more likely to be noticed by students of printed books than by students of the manuscript tradition is an indication of the distance that exists between the two groups—an unfortunate distance, since these points clearly have their implications for manuscript study as well and form one more illustration of the common issues facing all textual scholars. We thus come back to Dearing's assertion that "bibliographical thinking" should be excluded from "textual analysis." It is no doubt true that some textual critics have been confused in their thinking and have not differentiated between a document and the text it contains; but it is an overstatement to say that "textual critics in the past almost always confused the two genealogies when they did not devote their attention exclusively to the genealogy of records" (p. 15). In any case, the solution to the problem is not to banish the allegedly overemphasized bibliographical approach, since it unquestionably plays a crucial role in the whole process. To be fair to Dearing's argument, one must remember that he distinguishes "textual analysis" from "textual criticism": the latter is the larger term, covering all the stages of textual work, whereas the former is one particular operation, concerned with working out the "genealogy of the states of a text" (p. 2) and reconstructing their latest common ancestor. It is from "textual analysis" that bibliographical thinking is to be excluded. Nevertheless, one can insist that even here bibliographical analysis is important without being guilty of equating texts with records, for the texts are tied to the records, and an understanding of the physical evidence is necessary for an informed interpretation of the textual evidence. Dating a document (manuscript or printed book), for example, is significant even if one recognizes that the state of the text is not necessarily of the same date. Dearing makes much of what he sees as different uses of manuscript dates for textual analysts and for bibliographers: he neatly pairs the successful copyist, who "produces a record that postdates the state of the text it records," with the successful editor, who "produces a state of the text which anedates his exemplar" (p. 39). But to contrast "successful" copyists and editors is to place the emphasis on what they intended to do. In actuality copyists do not always reproduce with fidelity the texts in front of them, and though the records they create certainly postdate the records they use, their texts may also postdate those of the earlier records. Similarly, editors do not always succeed (it must be assumed but cannot be proved) in reconstructing earlier forms of the texts, and the texts they do produce may be said to postdate the other extant states. Without losing sight of the idea that the genealogy of texts is a different concept from the genealogy of documents, there is a real sense in which one may still claim that a text does date from the time it is inscribed or set in type. The changes introduced by a scribe or compositor, whether out of habitual practice or out of inadvertence, produce a new text; 17 and understanding as much as possible about the production of that text—the habits of the individual scribe, the characteristics of the period, and so on—helps one to know how certain readings occurred. If one rules out this knowledge, one makes textual analysis a rather fruitless exercise, for one may postulate relationships that are shown by physical evidence to be incorrect. Purely as abstract statements about agreements and divergences among certain messages, they are not incorrect, and this is Dearing's point; but so long as textual analysts are concerned—as they ultimately must be—with direction of descent, with genealogical relationships, they cannot ignore any physical evidence that eliminates certain relationships from further consideration as factual possibilities. Dearing himself does discuss general categories of scribal error (pp. 44-54) in his treatment of directional variation. Recognizing the influence of the physical process of transmission on what the text says (that is, "bibliographical thinking") cannot therefore be divorced from the analysis of the relationships among texts and need not involve a confusion of texts and records. Dearing asserts that textual analysts describe "not what was but what is and therefore what all can agree upon" (p. 19). They describe "what is," however, only if their aim is to record variant readings, and even then it is by no means certain that all would agree on what the reading of each text is at every point. But if the textual analyst's work includes reconstructing "the latest state from which all the extant states have descended," a state that is "in most respects the closest we can approach to the author's original intention" (p. 2), the textual analyst does deal with "what was," just as the bibliographer does. Both are engaged in historical reconstruction, and their tasks are intimately linked. When Dearing speaks of "bibliographical thinking" he may be referring more to descriptive bibliography (the history of the physical forms in which a work has appeared) than to analytical bibliography (the analysis of the physical evidence present in those physical forms), but the latter is of course a tool used in the former; in any case Dearing's approach, in the course of emphasizing texts as "messages," neglects the inextricability of the "transmitter" and the "message" and therefore the role of physical evidence in the interpretation of textual evidence that the textual analyst must perform. 18 In contrast, West's manual sets forth emphatically, if briefly, the role that the analysis of "external" evidence must play. He points out that the process of examining texts has refined "our understanding of the languages, metres, and styles of the Greeks and Romans," which in turn provides a background for examining further texts; we learn about "such matters as the proclivities of scribes" and "the processes governing the spread of texts at different periods" (p. 8) and need that knowledge (which, as he correctly says, is of interest in its own right) in evaluating particular texts. At other points he refers to the use of paleographical evidence and watermarks in dating manuscripts (p. 30), along with information about "what is known of the general historical conditions that governed the transmission of classical texts at different times" and "more particular facts such as the movements of individual known scribes" (p. 31); and he speaks of eliminating from the text "those features which we know, from our general knowledge of the history of books and writing, to have been introduced since the time of the author" (p. 54). He recognizes, in other words, the relation of physical evidence to textual study, even if he does not go beyond the traditional statements of its role. Like most writers of textual manuals, he explains the categories of alteration that scribes are likely to be responsible for (pp. 18-29); 19 as usual, these characteristics are discussed as generalized possibilities, and little attention is given to procedures for establishing the habits of individual scribes or assessing the textual implications of physical features that may reveal information about the method of production of individual manuscripts. One misses the kind of detail now standard in the compositorial and physical analysis of printed books; more work is needed for manuscript studies along the lines of Farquhar's and Van Sickle's investigations of the physical characteristics of codices and book rolls and Colwell's focus on the characteristics of particular scribes. 20 But even if, to students of printed books, West's manual seems to slight the explicit treatment of techniques for analyzing physical evidence, they would nevertheless find his essential position congenial. His repeated, if general, comments on the necessity for investigating the processes of the production of manuscripts form a sounder basis on which to proceed than Dearing's well-grounded but inappropriately applied segregation of bibliographical and textual concerns. West's inclusion of the results of paleographical analysis and watermark study among the types of "external" evidence points to the way in which terminology reflects point of view. To the analytical bibliographer such evidence would be thought of as internal, because it is part of the physical evidence of the document, as opposed to relevant information that comes from outside the document, such as that from publishers' archives or from one's knowledge of the book-making practices of the period (itself built up from internal evidence from other documents). West can place both watermark evidence and one's general knowledge of the period together as external evidence because they are both external to the text, even though one is not external to the document transmitting the text. Both usages—that of the analytical bibliographer and that of the textual critic—are proper: they simply result from different approaches to the material. Such differences in terminology should prove no obstacle to mutual comprehension so long as the operations being referred to are thoroughly understood and so long as the line between the approaches is not imagined to be firmer than it actually is. Some techniques of analytical bibliography—compositorial analysis, for instance—involve evidence drawn from the text itself; determining the habits of a compositor, or a scribe, depends on a close examination of practices within the text. One can say, and some have said, that this kind of examination takes the text only as additional physical evidence, regarding it simply as ink on paper. It is true that those inked shapes constituting the text are physical evidence; it is also true, however, that the analytical bibliographer must understand what the text says, in order to know which characteristics are worth studying as possibly attributable to compositorial or scribal practice. Determining whether this evidence is internal or external is not a very productive problem; what is important is to guard against equating "external" with "objective" and "internal" with "subjective." The terms unfortunately come to have these connotations in many discussions of the textual criticism of manuscripts. Sometimes "internal evidence" is used to refer to the kind of evidence adduced by an editor to support a conjectural emendation (largely evidence from context, which, in varying degrees, involves interpretation and is therefore subjective), and "external evidence" is taken to mean the relationship among manuscripts, which in turn leads (without the necessity of literary judgment) to the adoption of certain readings rather than others. West is too sensible to make this mistake: he describes "the more exact information derived from internal evidence" as "the interrelationships of the copies as inferred from comparison of their readings" (p. 31), recognizing that the establishment of a genealogy involves inferences and that the result is normally conjecture rather than established fact. Nevertheless, his statement is not as clear as it might be. One assumes that "copies" refers to texts, for if it referred to the manuscripts themselves the statement would be guilty of the confusion, about which Dearing warns, between records and texts. Even so, there is a problem, for the sentence seems to make "the interrelationships of the copies" wholly dependent on a "comparison of their readings" and leaves one wondering how the "external" evidence previously described fits in. "The inquiry," West says, "proceeds on two fronts, from external and from internal evidence" (p. 30). The external evidence of provenance, paleography, "general historical conditions," and the like then becomes the "historical backcloth" (p. 31) against which to "project the more exact information derived from internal evidence." Stated in this way, it is hard to comprehend precisely what the function of the "backcloth" is in the whole process. West does understand that physical evidence plays a role in interpreting the readings present in a text, but his category of "external evidence" is here presented largely as having to do with the relationships of documents rather than of texts. What is lacking is explicit recognition that the comparison of readings, leading to inferences about the relationships of the texts, must involve analysis of physical evidence as well as literary analysis: examination of the physical features of a document is relevant not only to dating the document but also to evaluating the readings in the text contained in that document. Whether one is dealing with printed books or with manuscripts, understanding the physical evidence may set limits on the literary speculation that can be engaged in. I do not wish to dwell on what is only an infelicity in West's exposition, but it provides an occasion for underscoring a significant point. Distinguishing "external" and "internal" as they refer to evidence is finally not so important as recognizing the interrelatedness of all evidence. Neither kind of evidence has a monopoly on demonstrable conclusions; because generalizations based on inductive evidence are inevitably provisional, some historical "facts" may be more conjectural than emendations based on an editor's judgment. And if one wishes to think of the physical evidence of a document as external to the text, then one must think of degrees of externality, for such evidence is not in the same realm as the larger historical framework into which one hopes to place both the document and the text. If West, instead of asserting that "the interrelationships of the copies as inferred from comparison of their readings" should be projected onto a "historical backcloth," had said—turning his statement around—that the comparison of readings, taken together with physical evidence and the historical background, results in the tentative establishment of the relationships among the texts, his comment would not have required discussion. That he could state the matter as loosely—in effect, carelessly—as he did must reflect, at least to some extent, a general lack of awareness, among textual critics of manuscript material, of the contribution analytical bibliography has made to the editing of printed texts. Some of the techniques of bibliographical analysis, such as some of those used to distinguish compositors, rely on characteristics of spelling and punctuation; and data about compositors' habits in these respects are important to the editor whose aim is to restore the author's spelling and punctuation as well as wording. 21 Most scholarly editors of postmedieval writing have such an aim: since spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and so on must be considered an integral part of texts, affecting their meaning, and since most of the extant documents containing these writings are relatively near to the authors' manuscripts (or include those manuscripts), editors dealing with these centuries have given a great deal of thought to the problem of authoritative spelling, punctuation, and capitalization (or "accidentals," as these features are sometimes called, in distinction to "substantives," or the words themselves). It is a common notion that the treatment of accidentals is one of the major respects in which the editing of ancient writing differs from the textual work on more recent material; because the spelling, punctuation, and system of abbreviations in the surviving texts of ancient works generally reflect the customs of scribes who lived long after the authors of the works, many people assume that even if these matters are of bibliographical significance they are not of textual importance and that editors of such texts would therefore find nothing relevant in the extensive discussion of recent decades concerning the accidentals in literature of the last five hundred years. At first glance there would seem to be good reason for this position, when one considers, among other points, that, although punctuation was in use from at least the fourth century B.C., the extent of its use is a matter of considerable debate; that in ancient times texts were normally written as a continuous series of letters, without spaces to separate words; and that in both Greek and Latin there was flexibility in spelling in certain periods. 22 Thus both the possibility of restoring to a classical text the spelling and punctuation of its author and the desirability of restoring certain features in use in the author's time (such as the lack of word-division) are seriously to be questioned. This conventional position is expressed by West in his manual when he says, "The critic is at liberty . . . to repunctuate, even if he has taken a vow never to depart from the paradosis" (p. 55). 23 Later he repeats, "Careful thought should be given to punctuation, which can be a great help or hindrance to following the author's train of ideas, and which is of course entirely a matter for the editor's discretion" (p. 69). The issue is not as simple, however, as these statements, taken out of context, would suggest, and West's own discussion raises some of the considerations that link so-called accidentals with meaning and with the author. West recognizes that "in theory an accent or a breathing in a medieval copy of a post-Hellenistic writer might go back to the author's autograph"; but he goes on to say that in most cases "all such features of the tradition will represent some later person's interpretation of a text consisting of virtually nothing but a continuous sequence of letters" (pp. 54-55) and that the textual critic is also "at liberty" to "reinterpret" the text in this respect. The question of how, or whether, to divide a continuous text into separated words is one that editors of modern works do not have to face, and it has therefore not been included in those editors' discussions of accidentals. In one sense word-division does fall into the group of features sometimes classed as "accidentals," for it is a matter of spacing and not of what letters are present. But obviously there may be ambiguous spots in an undivided text, where the letters can be formed into more than one set of words that make sense in the context, and matters of wording are usually called "substantive." The point is not what label ought to be used but the fact that the distinction between substantives and accidentals involves form, not meaning. 24 West further underlines the connection between marks and meaning when he says that, in the case of a nonsense word, "accents etc. may be valuable clues to what lies behind it, since they must have been supplied when the text was in a more intelligible state" (p. 55). Words that are not nonsense, however, may still be wrong (as West recognizes elsewhere), and accents or punctuation may provide clues anywhere in the text, not just where the text fails to make sense. Similarly, scribal abbreviations in manuscripts are not always unambiguous; and though West is right to caution that "abbreviations are not actually misread as often as some ingenious emenders think" (p. 28), editors should remember that abbreviations do sometimes affect substance as well as form. The same points are also applicable to spelling. As West realizes, spelling variants "can be of use (though not by themselves) in working out the details of a stemma, and they are not uninstructive in themselves" (p. 66). This view is not always accepted, even by persons who emphasize the breadth of significant evidence; thus Willis claims that "any variant other than the purely orthographical may be significant, however trivial it may appear" (p. 36). For Dearing spellings, and the other accidentals as well, enter into bibliographical, but not textual, analysis: "the textual analyst," he says, classifies variations as " substantive, quasi-substantive , and accidental and ignores the latter class" (p. 34); later he says that an editor who concludes that scribes or compositors were following copy "even in accidentals" can "make a bibliographical analysis in which he includes accidental variations with the rest of his evidence" (p. 154). The idea that accidentals partake more of the nature of physical than of textual evidence fails to give them their due as elements of meaning in a text; indeed, the interpolation of a class of "quasi-substantives" between substantives and accidentals shows that accidentals are being thought of here as not involving meaning. However, they are indisputably part of the text and may affect the meaning of the text at any time; whether or not they do in a given instance 25 has no bearing on their classification as accidentals. I am not suggesting that scribal punctuation, abbreviations, and spelling necessarily ought to be preserved in a critical text, but they should certainly be taken seriously as part of the textual evidence present in manuscripts; they may point to how the text was understood at a particular time and may therefore—like the words themselves—be a link to a tradition and help to establish the author's meaning. The attention one pays to accidentals, in other words, goes beyond the question of whether they reflect authorial or scribal practice. It is no doubt true that the accidentals in surviving manuscripts of classical texts exhibit more alterations by scribes than do the words, and equally true that editors have more basis for attempting to establish authors' wording than punctuation and spelling. Nevertheless, scribes do alter words as well as accidentals; the distinction is one of degree, and the texts one has to deal with contain both words and accidentals. If one decides in a given case that the accidentals of the manuscript tradition have no authority, the decision results not from theory but from the circumstances of the individual situation. To agree with Greg that people involved in the transmission of a text have generally felt freer to alter accidentals than to alter substantives is not to say that accidentals in scribal copies are necessarily unauthoritative, though it does provide a basis, when the evidence warrants, for treating accidentals differently from substantives. The editor is finally responsible for establishing both substantives and accidentals, and to assume that scribal accidentals are too far removed from the author's practice to be worth preserving is to ignore the connections between accidentals and meaning. One may not in the end accept those accidentals, but the question of what accidentals to include in a critical text must be faced. Authorial accidentals in ancient texts may be more conjectural than in modern texts, but the attempt to approximate them is not necessarily to be rejected in favor of standardized spelling and modernized punctuation. West's discussion takes this point into account: As a general rule it would seem most rational to impose consistently the spelling that the original author is most likely to have used (for which the manuscript tradition may not be the best evidence). It is true that he himself may have been inconsistent, and it may be argued that the best manuscript authority should be followed on each occasion. But this will be no reliable guide to his practice; we shall surely come nearer the truth by regularizing the spelling than by committing ourselves to the vagaries of the tradition. (p. 69) Presumably this "regularizing" would be to the practice contemporary with the author, insofar as it is known. West also takes up briefly the question of variations in spelling in Greek and Latin: in contrast to early Greek, he says, "In Latin there is not the problem of different alphabetic systems, but notions of the correct way to spell things were more fluid until the first century of the Empire, and here again (though with less justification) the convention has been established of presenting authors at least of the late Republic in the orthography of a somewhat later period" (pp. 69-70). This matter is not pursued, but a doubt about the convention has been registered. The point he proceeds to make about still later texts in which "it is often impossible to distinguish between the barbarisms of copyists and those of the original" is illogical but instructive: "In this situation, rather than impose a consistent system which can only be chosen rather arbitrarily, it is better to follow the paradosis, not under the delusion that it is at all reliable, but as the most convenient way of exhibiting it" (p. 70). Of course, in a critical, as opposed to a diplomatic, text, exhibiting the paradosis within the text is not in itself a virtue, and the accidentals of the paradosis would properly be retained only if there is a chance of their reflecting authorial practice more accurately than another system. But West's concern for establishing accidentals contemporary with the author and possibly retaining the accidentals of the manuscript tradition is uncommon in this field; though his discussion is undeveloped, it implies a greater link than some have imagined with the approach to accidentals followed by many editors of post-medieval work. Indeed, one must ask whether for a work of any period there is ever a justification, from a scholarly point of view, of any aim regarding accidentals other than the reconstruction of the author's own practice; however imperfectly that aim may be realized in many instances, it is the only aim consistent with the view that accidentals are integral to a text and that modernization therefore has no place in scholarly editing. Without underestimating the differences between ancient and modern texts, one can see a common issue here; West's brief remarks would strike an editor of modern literature as bordering on familiar territory. 26 These considerations have direct implications for the apparatus. Since accidentals can affect meaning and scribal practices in accidentals can constitute important textual evidence, a complete recording of such details, as well as of substantive variants, would seem to be desirable. Selectivity, of one kind or another, has been the rule, however, in apparatuses for early texts, though disagreement has existed about the principles of selection. Willis approvingly claims that it is "a matter of common consent that purely orthographical variants should be excluded" (p. 35). His statement is disproved by West, who finds it "advisable to record orthographical variants fairly systematically, at least for portions of the text," and who further implies their significance by holding that, if one decides not to record "certain orthographical trivialities," "the fact should be stated" (p. 66). 27 Of course, printing costs sometimes dictate selectivity. Even some of the CEAA/CSE editions of nineteenth-century authors, which always contain complete lists of editorial alterations in the copy-texts, exclude accidentals from the lists of variants among other collated texts. But it is one thing to be selective as a result of believing that completeness is unimportant or even undesirable and quite another to recognize selectivity as a matter of expediency only—for in the former case one is likely to think that subjective notions of significance are sufficient for determining what to include, whereas in the latter one will wish to define the categories included or excluded as objectively as possible. Willis advocates (in addition to the elimination of spelling variants) the exclusion of certain manuscripts, but on grounds that grossly misunderstand the purposes of an apparatus: "An apparatus criticus," he maintains, "which tries to use too many manuscripts is liable not only to be obscure and hard to use (the problem of finding enough sigla is not the least), but to be inaccurate, since the task of collating accurately some thirty or forty manuscripts is enormous for one man, and to find and organize reliable helpers is scarcely less difficult than doing it all oneself" (p. 43). It seems hardly necessary to reply to these objections, for the difficulty of using a complex apparatus is of no importance to a person who values having the evidence recorded (the designation of sigla is surely a trivial matter), and the attainment of accuracy is always a challenge, regardless of the scope of the coverage (one wonders how scholarship would ever progress if this challenge were allowed to inhibit activity). Willis's statement that "About ten manuscripts should be enough to set up the text of a Latin author" (p. 42) may be accurate on the average (I am not questioning Willis's knowledge of his field), but it seems unwise to prescribe how much evidence will be significant. In justifying a selective approach, Willis enunciates the principle that it is preferable "to give all the readings of some than some of the readings of all" (p. 44). This particular point can be (and has been) 28 legitimately objected to, but the motivation behind it—to find an objective basis for selectivity—is one to be taken seriously. Dearing, thinking along the same lines, says, "The critic should define the interesting variations as precisely as possible so as to be consistent and accurate himself and to facilitate consistency and accuracy in the work of his staff or associates" (p. 147). There is no doubt that the number of manuscripts available in some cases, especially in biblical studies, is so large as to make impractical the goal of recording everything in all of them (or even the examination of all of them). But whenever one finds it necessary to be selective—either in the texts to be covered or in the details from those texts to be recorded—one should remember that no amount of rationalization will conceal the fact that the resulting apparatus is a compromise and is less satisfactory than a complete record. In such cases one owes the reader the courtesy of an unambiguous definition of what is included (not just some such statement as "the most significant readings"), so that the reader will be in the position of knowing precisely what kinds of evidence must be looked for elsewhere. 29 These questions concerning the construction of an apparatus thus raise issues relevant to all textual scholarship, regardless of the period involved or the nature of the surviving textual witnesses—as indeed, I have tried to suggest, do many other questions relating to other aspects of the editorial process.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II If discussion of the role of punctuation and spelling and of physical analysis in editing has been rather neglected in the theoretical writings devoted to early texts, the problem of how to determine the relationships among the surviving texts certainly has not been neglected. The great body of literature on the theory of the textual criticism of ancient and medieval writings has focused on what is after all at the heart of all critical editing: the question how to choose among variant readings, which in turn involves an assessment of the relationships among the witnesses and an evaluation of when a departure from all the variants would bring one closer to the author's intention. These matters have of course been debated at length by editors of modern works also, and the same central issues link all these discussions together. All of them in fact can be seen as variations on the theme of objectivity versus subjectivity. Some urge the desirability of as objective a system as possible, in which the role of the scholar's own judgment is minimized; others argue for the superiority of taste and insight applied to individual cases over the attempt to follow a predetermined rule. One's position along this spectrum affects, directly or indirectly, how one will approach all other textual questions—such as how much authority one assigns to a "copy-text" or a "best text" and how much freedom one perceives to be justified in altering it (by drawing on other texts or on one's own conjectures). Fluctuations from one direction to the other have characterized editorial thinking in all fields; but the lack of interdisciplinary communication is reflected in the fact that the various fields have not fluctuated in unison. Fredson Bowers, writing on "Textual Criticism" in the 1958 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , illustrates this point by suggesting how the editing of modern texts has benefited from earlier work on the classics: "The acceptance of Housman's attitude and its extension, about the middle of the 20th century, to editing from printed texts constitutes one of the most interesting of modern developments in editorial theory." Bowers here takes Housman as the exponent of a movement away from the Lachmannian tradition of relying whenever possible on the archetype as established through genealogical reasoning. Although many have pointed out the fallacy of believing that a "best" text has the correct readings at points where it is not obviously in need of emendation, Housman's famous remark in the preface to his 1903 edition of the first book of the Astronomicon of Manilius must be regarded as the classic statement of it: To believe that wherever a best MS. gives possible readings it gives true readings, and that only where it gives impossible readings does it give false readings, is to believe that an incompetent editor is the darling of Providence, which has given its angels charge over him lest at any time his sloth and folly should produce their natural results and incur their appropriate penalty. Chance and the common course of nature will not bring it to pass that the readings of a MS. are right wherever they are possible and impossible wherever they are wrong: that needs divine intervention; . . . . 30 The reason that this fallacious approach (the "art of explaining corrupt passages instead of correcting them" [p. 41]) gained currency, according to Housman, is not only that "superstition" is more comfortable than truth but also that it was a reaction against an earlier age in which "conjecture was employed, and that by very eminent men, irrationally" (p. 43). Exactly the same sequence—but delayed by several decades—can be observed in the history of editorial approaches to printed texts. R. B. McKerrow's edition of Thomas Nashe (1904), though it appeared at almost the same time as Housman's Manilius, represented the kind of distrust of eclecticism that Housman was attacking. McKerrow was one of a group of scholars of English Renaissance drama whose work would revolutionize the study of printed texts by showing the interdependence of physical and textual evidence; the analytical techniques that resulted did at times enable McKerrow and his colleagues to settle a textual point conclusively, as a matter of demonstrable fact, and to that extent editing was legitimately put on a more "scientific" basis. But in most cases there was still a large area in which the facts were not conclusive, and here McKerrow took the position that involved the least exercise of editorial judgment, the decision to adhere to the text chosen as copy-text. In so doing he was reacting, at least in part, against the undisciplined eclecticism that had characterized the nineteenth-century editing in this field. 31 The event that Bowers refers to, in the mid-twentieth century, representing a reinstatement of editorial judgment—but, like Housman's, on a more responsible basis than previously—was W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Greg broke down the notion of a single authoritative text in two ways: the more novel way, which he was the first to suggest, was that the primary authority for accidentals might reside in a different text from that for substantives (generally an early text for the accidentals, a later one for the substantives); the less surprising way, in line with Housman's criticisms, was that an editor could judge individual readings on their own terms and did not have to accept all variants that were not manifestly impossible simply because they came from a text that was known to contain some authorial revisions. 32 Both Greg and Housman restore editorial judgment to a place of prominence; but that judgment is firmly directed toward the determination of what the author would have written, whereas the earlier proponents of eclecticism (against whom the immediate predecessors of Greg and Housman were rebelling) tended to be less scrupulous in distinguishing between what they themselves preferred and what the authors being edited would have preferred. The hope of having a single text to rely on dies hard, however, and one mark of the wisdom of Greg's essay is that he recognized the danger that he labeled "the tyranny of the copy-text." 33 Although his rationale for selecting a copy-text entailed choosing a text that could justifiably be accorded presumptive authority in cases where the variants seemed completely equal (particularly, in practice, in regard to accidentals), he understood that there had always been a temptation to let the weight of copy-text authority extend to readings that did not deserve such support. Greg's rationale does not (though some of its critics seem to think it does) provide timid editors with the opportunity to shirk, in the respectable name of conservatism, difficult decisions. Of course, it can rightly be regarded as conservative, and sensibly so, to retain a copy-text reading, even if one personally does not prefer it, when one is not convinced that any of the alternatives are authorial; Greg's point is simply that one should not be deterred, by whatever authority attaches to the copy-text, from altering it when one is convinced (through critical insight, in the light of all available evidence) that another reading is, or comes nearer to, what the author intended. 34 Sometimes editors, both of classical and of modern works, argue that the most they are justified in doing is to attempt to purge the copy-text, or archetype, or paradosis, of errors—not to try to restore what the author wrote. But this argument cannot be praised for its respect of historical evidence; rather, it confuses two kinds of edition, both legitimate, neither of which, when done properly, disregards the evidence. If one is interested in a text as it appeared at a particular time to a particular audience, a diplomatic or facsimile edition of it serves the purpose best; correcting errors in it—editing it critically—would be out of place, for the errors, though unintended, were part of what the contemporary readers saw in the text in front of them. If, on the other hand, one wishes to correct errors—to try to repair the damage done to the text in transmission, however famous or influential its corrupt form may be—then one is producing a text that differs from any now extant (probably from any that ever existed), and the aim of the alterations is obviously not the preservation of a documentary from of the text but the construction of a text as close as possible (as close, that is, as surviving evidence permits) to the one the author intended. 35 Some confusion on this point has been exhibited in the debate among editors of modern works over whether to choose an author's final manuscript as copy-text in preference to the first printed edition set from it. Of course, any attempt to fix a general rule on this matter is misguided, since situations vary greatly, and in some cases an author's revisions in proof may have been so thorough as to make the printed edition the proper choice. Some editors, however, prefer the first edition not for such reasons, but because it is the product of a historical moment; even though some aspects of its text may be the result of changes made in the publishing office or pressures brought to bear on the author by the publisher or others, the author accepted these conditions, they say, as part of the whole publishing process, and the text of the first edition is the one that emerged from a specific set of historical forces and the one that the public first read. This argument, however, leads only to the production of a facsimile edition; it has no relevance to a critical edition, although it is sometimes offered as if it did have, through a failure to think clearly about what the two approaches mean. Editors of earlier material do not encounter the problem in quite this form, since they do not deal with authorial manuscripts or authorially supervised printed texts, but the general issues are familiar to them. One manifestation of the exaggerated respect accorded to individual printed texts is the problem of the textus receptus of ancient writings. The text of the New Testament, or of other writings, that reached print was not, of course, necessarily more authoritative than other texts; but the controversy that sometimes surrounds editorial decisions to depart from the textus receptus suggests the irrationality with which a favored text can be defended. Clearly there are many differences between this situation and the question, faced by editors of modern works, whether to turn from printed book to manuscript for copy-text. But there is an essential similarity as well: in both cases the scholar's responsibility is to examine all the evidence in an effort to come as close as possible to the text intended by the author, 36 however many or few steps removed such a text may be from the texts that survive. Deciding whether an author's intention includes acquiescence to changes made by the publisher is a problem of more immediate concern to editors of modern writings; even so, such an editor's decision to follow a first edition may look just as foolish as the hesitation to depart from the textus receptus on the part of an editor of earlier material. Greg's rationale for selecting a copy-text was of course set forth in the first instance for editors of printed texts that are not far removed from authorial manuscripts; and near the beginning of his essay he distinguishes his approach (growing out of McKerrow's) from that appropriate for the classics. In the latter, he says, "it is the common practice, for fairly obvious reasons, to normalize the spelling," whereas in the editing of English texts "it is now usual to preserve the spelling of the earliest or it may be some other selected text": Thus it will be seen that the conception of "copy-text" does not present itself to the classical and to the English editor in quite the same way; indeed, if I am right in the view I am about to put forward, the classical theory of the "best" or "most authoritative" manuscript, whether it be held in a reasonable or in an obviously fallacious form, has really nothing to do with the English theory of "copy-text" at all. (p. 375) It is true that a concern for incorporating in an edition documentary punctuation and spelling led to Greg's perception that the text with authority for accidentals might not be the same as the one with authority for substantives and to his statement that "the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals" (p. 381). In fact, however, the distinction between substantives and accidentals, though it has its uses, is not crucial to the concept of copy-text that Greg calls "English," as the word "generally" in his sentence suggests. Editors following Greg's general line would in practice emend the copy-text with a later reading of any kind, a substantive or an accidental, that could convincingly be argued to be authorial; and in the cases where the variants seem evenly balanced, they would fall back on the copy-text reading. Thus what underlies this conception of copy-text is the idea of presumptive authority, a text to be relied on when one finds no basis for preferring one variant over another—an authority, it must be emphasized, that does not restrict one's freedom to choose variants from other texts when there is reason to do so. It may be that editors of modern writings will normally choose their copy-texts, as Greg was the first to point out explicitly, to serve primarily as the authority for accidentals; but it does not follow that a different understanding of copy-text is required for editors of earlier materials, even when they are not concerned with reproducing documentary accidentals. 37 The fact that editors dealing with different periods may have to take somewhat different positions regarding accidentals is a superficial matter that does not alter the fundamental questions they all have to face. The real issue that should be raised about the "English" conception of copy-text is whether the idea of a text of presumptive authority is appropriate to all patterns of textual descent—an issue relevant to modern as well as earlier texts. If we are not distracted by the problem, undeniably troublesome, of how to treat spelling and punctuation, we can see that Greg's essay takes its place in the larger tradition of textual theory: like the seminal pieces on the editing of classical, biblical, and medieval works, its dual theme is textual authority and editorial freedom. To state a rationale of copy-text is inevitably to take a position on how much weight should be given to the editor's critical judgment in establishing a text—that is to say, how much alteration should be permitted in any given documentary form of the text, on the basis of the editor's assessment of its status, of the variants in other texts, and of further conjectures. The principal approaches to this question that have been advanced over the years are well known, and have often been surveyed. 38 I propose to do no more here than specify some main lines, so that Greg's rationale can be seen in relation to them. They have not usually been taken up in this context, but doing so shows, I think, that editorial discussion might be sharpened by greater awareness of the entire tradition. 39 For this purpose it is not necessary to go back beyond the approach usually associated with Karl Lachmann. Although scholars have shown that Lachmann's own contributions to the development of the "genealogical" approach have been greatly exaggerated, 40 his editions of the New Testament (1831) and of Lucretius (1850) stand as monuments linking his name with this method. Historically the importance of this movement is that it represented a reaction against the unprincipled eclecticism that had prevailed in the previous century (of which Richard Bentley was the most important, and most notorious, exemplar) and marked a recognition of what a scholarly approach must entail, at a time when ancient documents were beginning to be more accessible. There can be no question that the general drift of the genealogical approach is correct: that scholars must examine all the extant documents, learn as much about them as possible, and attempt to establish the relationships among the texts they contain. This much we would now take for granted as part of what it means to be scholarly. The difficulty comes in choosing a means for working out those relationships and in deciding what use to make of the data thus postulated; and when people refer to "the genealogical method" they normally mean the particular recommendations on these matters associated with Lachmann and his followers. Taken in this sense, the genealogical method can certainly be criticized, and its defects have by now been enumerated many times. 41 The essence of the method is to classify texts into families by examining "common errors," on the assumption that texts showing common errors have a common ancestor. 42 Despite the obvious fallacies of such an approach, it had an influential life of more than a century and is regarded as the classic method of textual criticism. Two landmarks in its history added to its stature but at the same time can be seen to have made its weaknesses evident. One is B. F. Westcott and F. J. A. Hort's great Introduction to their edition of the New Testament (1881), which brilliantly stated the rationale for the approach and improved it methodologically (e.g., by focusing on agreements in correct or possibly correct readings rather than agreements in errors); they conclusively showed the illogic of relying on the textus receptus . However, as Ernest Colwell has carefully explained, Westcott and Hort in practice did not strictly adhere to the method, recognizing that editorial judgment in assessing the general credibility of individual manuscripts and the intrinsic merits of individual readings must remain central, even in an approach that emphasizes objectivity. 43 The second classic statement of the genealogical method is Paul Maas's famous essay, "Textkritik" (1927), best known to English readers in Barbara Flower's translation (not published until 1958). 44 It is a highly abstract distillation of the basic principles, showing their logic and soundness under certain conditions; but unfortunately those stated conditions (p. 3)—that each scribe copied from a single exemplar, not "contaminating" the tradition by drawing readings from two or more exemplars, and that each scribe also made distinctive departures, consciously or unconsciously, from that exemplar—are unlikely to have obtained in real situations. 45 The force of these weaknesses is obvious, as is their relevance to the textual analysis of later material. Another of the often-discussed limitations of the method deserves to be underscored here: the fact that it does not make allowance for authorial revisions, for the possibility that variant readings result from the author's second thoughts as well as from scribes' errors and alterations. This oversight is not unique to the genealogical method but in fact exists, in greater or less degree, in all the approaches to textual criticism, regardless of the date of the works being considered. It springs from wishful thinking, for however difficult it is to choose among variants, it is easier to proceed on the basis that one is right and the others wrong than to recognize that several may be "right" or at least represent the author's preference at different times. Even among editors of modern works, where many authorial revisions can be documented, there is a reluctance to conceive of a text as containing multiple possibilities; and though an editor's goal is indeed to "establish" a text, editors—of works from all periods—should not forget that a "work" comprehends all the authorial readings within its several texts. Another common criticism of the genealogical method—that one must revert to one's own judgment when the choice is, to quote Maas, "between different traditions of equal 'stemmatical' value" (p. 1)—calls attention to what may be a more serious problem: the tendency to think that the method generally minimizes the role of subjective judgment. The Lachmannian system is responsible for the standard division of editorial activity into recension and emendation and is therefore conducive to an attitude, as I suggested earlier, that takes the first of these procedures to be more objective than it is (or can be). There is superficially an appropriateness in distinguishing readings thought of by the editor from those present in at least one of the surviving documents; indeed, from the point of view of documentary evidence, one is bound to regard any proposed reading not in the documents as falling into a distinctly separate category. But from the point of view of what are likely to be the authorial readings, this distinction is of no significance, for an editorial "conjecture" may be more certainly what the author wrote than any of the alternative readings at a point of variation. The very term "conjecture," or "conjectural emendation," prejudices the case; readings in the manuscripts are less conjectural only in the sense that they actually appear in documents, but they are not necessarily for that reason more certain. One is conjecturing in deciding that one of them is more likely to be authorial than another, just as one conjectures in rejecting all the variants at a given point in favor of still another reading. The process of conjecture begins as soon as one combines readings from two documents, 46 and every decision about what is an "error" in a document rests on the editor's judgment. Unquestionably the attempt to establish first a transmitted text is a more responsible procedure than to engage at once in speculation, before surveying the range of documentary evidence; but one must then resist the temptation to regard that text as an objective fact. Colwell states this point well in a comment on Hort: His prudent rejection of almost all readings which have no manuscript support has given the words "conjectural emendation" a meaning too narrow to be realistic. In the last generation we have depreciated external evidence of documents and have appreciated the internal evidence of readings; but we have blithely assumed that we were rejecting "conjectural emendation" if our conjectures were supported by some manuscripts. We need to recognize that the editing of an eclectic text rests upon conjectures. (p. 107) This problem is equally of concern to editors of modern works. Although their tendency to use "emendation" to mean any editorial change in the copy-text, including readings drawn from other documents, is more realistic, they are inclined to think that they are being cautious if they choose a documentary reading over one newly proposed by an editor. Such is not necessarily true, of course: the quality of the reading is everything, finally, and the editorial tact necessary to recognize that quality is at the heart of the whole process. The system associated with Lachmann's name cannot be held entirely responsible for editors' misunderstanding of this point, but it does seem to make the point harder to see by imputing to certain kinds of editorial decisions a greater objectivity than can usually exist. Some of the people who have criticized the "Lachmann method" have set forth alternative approaches that have themselves become the subject of considerable discussion. One such person is Joseph Bédier, whose work, particularly influential in the medieval field, can serve to represent another general approach to editing. The introduction to his second edition (1913) of Jean Renart's Le Lai de l'Ombre , which has become the point of departure for the twentieth-century criticism of Lachmann, 47 concentrates on the two-branched stemma as evidence of the weakness of the genealogical method. The fact that most stemmata turn out to be dichotomous is regarded suspiciously as indicating more about the operation of the system than about the actual relationships among the manuscripts. What Bédier recommends instead is to choose a single good manuscript and to reprint it exactly except for any alterations that the editor finds imperative. This approach has been called "a return to the method of the humanists of the Renaissance"; 48 certainly it is a move in the opposite direction from Housman's criticism of Lachmann at nearly the same time. When Giorgio Pasquali, ridiculing this best-manuscript approach, linked the English Shakespeare scholars with the medievalists in following it, 49 he was essentially correct in regard to the period before Greg's "Rationale." There is no question that, in spite of Housman's incontrovertible logic, the best-text theory —whether or not directly influenced by Bédier in every case—held sway over a great deal of editing in the first half of the twentieth century. An instructive paradox of the commentary on Bédier is that his position has been regarded both as extremely conservative, restricting the role of editorial judgment, and as extremely subjective, emphasizing the editor's own critical decisions. The strict adherence to a single text does suggest an attempt to minimize subjectivity; but the leeway then allowed the editor in deciding what readings are not possible and must be replaced sets very few restrictions on subjectivity. The point in the editorial procedure where subjectivity enters may seem to have been shifted, but its extent has not been reduced. And in fact it is present from the beginning in both approaches—both in the selection of a "best" text and in the decisions involved in recensio . Followers of Bédier and of Lachmann have been adept at suppressing recognition of the role of critical judgment at certain stages of the processes they favor, and they have failed to see that their apparently quite different approaches have much in common. The narrowness and confusion exhibited by such partisans can be illustrated in the work of a distinguished medievalist, Eugène Vinaver. 50 Admiring Bédier's criticism of Lachmann, he makes sweeping claims for the newer system: Recent studies in textual criticism mark the end of an age-long tradition. The ingenious technique of editing evolved by the great masters of the nineteenth century has become as obsolete as Newton's physics, and the work of generations of critics has lost a good deal of its value. It is no longer possible to classify manuscripts on the basis of "common errors"; genealogical "stemmata" have fallen into discredit, and with them has vanished our faith in composite critical texts. (p. 351) The real issue of course is whether objective rules or individual judgment will bring us closer to the author's text, and this fact is nowhere better shown than in the conclusion Vinaver draws from these observations (that "composite critical texts" are discredited) or in the statement he proceeds to make: "nothing has done more to raise textual criticism to the position of a science than the realisation of the inadequacy of the old methods of editing." Housman, for instance, would have agreed in general with most of Vinaver's paragraph but would have come to the opposite conclusion: that we must put more faith in critical texts and not aim to place editing in "the position of a science." 51 Vinaver realizes that Bédier's position, which he essentially approves, does not eliminate subjectivity, and his own effort toward injecting more objectivity into it is to explain six kinds of errors that arise from scribal transcription. 52 Knowledge of them, he believes, will "widen the scope of 'mechanical' emendation" and "narrow the limits of 'rational' editing" (p 365). 53 Vinaver is one of those editors who, in their eagerness to find objective criteria for editorial decisions, exaggerate the distinction between correcting an error and making a conjectural emendation. Vinaver's attention to scribal error stems from his belief that an editor should aim at "lessening the damage done by the copyists," not at reconstructing the original. To do the latter, he thinks, would be to "indulge in a disguised collaboration with the author" (p. 368). He does not seem to see that attempting to restore what the author wrote is different from altering the text to what, in one's own opinion, the author should have written. Like Bédier and other advocates of the best-text approach, he is not willing to say that the former is important enough to be worth risking along the way a few instances of the latter. Yet in defining the editor's role as that of "a referee in the strictly mechanical conflict between the author and the scribe" (p. 368), he does not eliminate the problem; he is not, after all, ruling out every editorial departure from the chosen text, and he leaves unsolved the question how one can satisfactorily distinguish safe and unsafe categories of critical activity. His effort to assist Bédier proves no assistance in the end, for he overestimates, along with Bédier, the difference between their approach and Lachmann's. It is interesting to learn that the predominance of the dichotomous stemma is mathematically not such an oddity as Bédier thought; 54 but that fact does not make Lachmann right and Bédier wrong. The approaches associated with both their names are in fact subject to the same criticisms, for they both cover up much of the uncertainty and subjectivity in the detection of error and therefore entail a misunderstanding of the nature and scope of conjectural emendation. It was inevitable that the desire for objectivity in textual analysis would lead to the use of quasi-mathematical or quasi-statistical approaches. Nine years after Bédier's famous introduction, Henri Quentin, in his Mémoire sur l'etablissement du texte de la Vulgate (1922), announced a system that proved to be the first of a long line of twentieth-century attempts to make textual analysis something akin to formal logis. 55 The heart of Quentin's system is the rule that, in any group of three manuscripts, the intermediary between the other two will sometimes agree with one or both of them, but they will never agree against it. Quentin's system is thus to build a stemma by taking up manuscripts (and their families) in groups of three, following this rule. In the process of comparison no attempt is made to recognize "errors"; variants are simply variants, without a direction of descent implied. The concept of the intermediary therefore encompasses three possibilities: the intermediary could be (a) the archetype from which the other two manuscripts are independently descended, (b) the descendant of one of them and the ancestor of the other, or (c) the descendant, through conflation, of both of them. In order to determine which of these possibilities is actually true, Quentin resorts to so-called "internal" evidence—that is, to subjective judgments about the nature of the variants. He envisions his system as an attempt to reconstruct the archetype—the latest ancestor of all the surviving texts—rather than the author's original; in Lachmannian terms, he is concerned only with recensio . And certain central difficulties in Lachmann are present in Quentin also: the definiteness Quentin imputes to his method does not seem fully to recognize the amount of subjectivity that is finally relied upon; nor does the suggestion that there is something more objective in attempting to reconstruct the archetype than in trying to approach the author's original acknowledge adequately how indistinct the line is between the two, at least from the point of view of the nature and certainty of the conjectures involved. 56 Although the same cannot be said of W. W. Greg's effort five years later ( The Calculus of Variants , 1927)—for Greg more openly admits the limitations of his "calculus"—the problems with his work are essentially the same. The details of his procedure are of course different (in a quasi-algebraic operation, he factors his formulaic representations of complex variants so that he can focus on two variants at a time), but it reaches an impasse, as Quentin's does, beyond which one cannot proceed without the introduction of subjective judgments regarding genetic relationships. As a mental exercise (and as a demonstration of the keenness of Greg's analytic mind), the Calculus is a fascinating work; but as a contribution to editorial theory it does not have the significance of his "The Rationale of Copy-Text" a generation later. 57 Not long after the publication of Quentin's and Greg's proposals, William P. Shepard performed the interesting experiment of applying both to a number of medieval works, some of which had previously been studied by other textual scholars. Invariably the two methods produced different stemmata, both from each other and from those proposed by earlier editors. Shepard's experiments, as he stressed, are not conclusive, but they lend weight to his doubt whether the human activity of copying can be given a "mechanistic explanation." 58 He recognized, however, that "we are bound to seek such an explanation if we can"; and the dream that "some day a law or a formula will be discovered which we can apply to the reconstruction of a text as easily and as safely as the chemists now apply laws of analysis or synthesis" (p. 141) continues to intrigue us, as evidenced by the scholars—such as Archibald Hill, Antonín Hrubý, and Vinton A. Dearing—who have followed in the tradition of Quentin and Greg. 59 Hill, Hrubý, and Dearing all attempt to work out problems left unsettled by Greg, and all recognize the importance, first seen clearly by Quentin, of examining distributional before genealogical evidence (i.e., studying the record of variant readings for evidence of relationships before attempting to assess which descended from which). Hill proposes a principle of "simplicity" as a mechanical means for choosing among alternative stemmata: one scores two points for each line connecting a hypothetical intermediary and one point for the other lines and then selects the diagram yielding the smallest total. Hrubý tries to use probability calculus applied to individual readings in texts in order to solve what Greg called "the ambiguity of three texts"—to distinguish, in other words, between states of a text resulting from independent descent and those resulting from successive descent. Dearing's work is an extension of Greg, taking into account and adapting Quentin's idea of intermediaries and Hill's of simplicity; like Greg, he offers a "calculus" that involves the rewriting of variations, and he sets forth in detail the formal logic that underlies it. Because a primary deficiency of earlier approaches was their inability to deal with situations in which a scribe conflated the texts of two or more manuscripts, 60 Dearing's handling of this problem is of particular interest. For him, a logical consequence of his distinction between bibliographical and textual analysis is that in the latter conflation simply does not exist. A scribe using two manuscripts, he says, would not think of himself as conflating them but as attempting to produce a more accurate text (a text nearer the archetype) than either of them; to say that he had "manufacturered one state of the message out of two others" would be "to confuse means and ends" (p. 17). The bibliographer, who is concerned with the physical means of textual transmission, can say that a record has been produced out of two others; but the textual analyst will see it simply as a message that may at times have affinities with other texts. Although this observation is presented as a remarkable revelation ("The light of truth blinded Saint Paul. New insights are not always easy to understand, much less to accept when understood"), one may wonder whether it is not in fact commonly understood and taken for granted. Clarity of thought does demand that some such distinction be recognized, and one cannot quarrel with Dearing for attempting to make it explicit; but whether it materially affects one's dealing with "conflation" is another matter. If, from the textual point of view, there can be no "conflation," one has eliminated the word as an appropriate way of describing the situation; but one has not eliminated the situation itself or the problem it poses for textual analysis. Dearing speaks instead of "rings" in genealogical trees and devotes considerable space to techniques for rewriting trees so as to eliminate rings, either by inferring states or by breaking the weakest connection in a ring. One breaks the weakest, rather than some other, link in deference to the "principle of parsimony": "The fewest possible readings are treated as something different from what they really are" (p. 88). As with the other systems, the nature of the concessions required to make the system work causes one to question the validity of the results. 61 Dearing's effort to encompass conflation within his system is laudable, but his confidence that his book "for the first time formulates the axioms of textual analysis and demonstrates their inevitability" (p. x) would seem to be excessive. 62 In the half century since Shepard discussed Quentin and Greg a great deal of effort has been expended on statistical approaches to textual analysis, but there seems little reason for a more optimistic verdict than his. Different as these various methods—from Lachmann to Dearing—are, they all have the same problem: the questions of conflation and the direction of descent prove to be the stumbling block for systems that attempt to achieve objectivity, and those systems either rely on subjective decisions, covertly or openly, or else set up conditions that limit their relevance to actual situations. This is not to say that one or another of the procedures developed in these systems will not be helpful to editors—of modern as well as earlier material—on certain occasions, 63 and editors can profit from the discussion of theoretical issues that the exposition of these systems has produced. But the impulse to minimize the role of human judgment (the view, in Dearing's words, that "textual analysis, having absolute rules, is not an art" [p. 83]) has not led to any satisfactory comprehensive system. In this context, it is useful to look again at the approach suggested by Greg in "The Rationale of Copy-Text," for it places no restrictions on individual judgment—that is, informed judgment, taking all relevant evidence into account and directed toward the scholarly goal of establishing the text as the author wished it. The idea that all alterations made by an editor in the selected copy-text are emendations—whether they come from other documentary texts or from the editor's (or some editor's) inspiration—gives rise to a fundamentally different outlook from that which often has prevailed in the textual criticism of earlier material. It leads to a franker acceptance of the centrality of critical judgment because it calls attention to the similarity, rather than the difference, between adopting a reading from another text and adopting a reading that is one's own conjecture. Both result in a form of the text unlike that in any known document and therefore represent editorial judgment in departing from documentary evidence. Some documentary readings are—or seem—obviously wrong, but obviousness is itself subjective, and correcting even the most obvious error is an act of judgment; and attempting to work out the relationships among variant documentary readings involves judgment, or at least, as we have seen, evaluation of the varying results of different systems for establishing those relationships. This approach recognizes that what is transmitted is a series of texts and that to think of a single text, made up of readings from the documentary texts, as "what is transmitted" is to confuse a product of judgment based on the documentary evidence with the documentary evidence itself. But the choice of one of the extant texts as a copy-text in the sense that emerges from Greg's rationale is not at all the same as taking a "best-text" approach (whether Bédier's or some other variety), for one has no obligation to favor the copy-text whenever one has reason to believe that another reading is nearer to what the author intended. Indeed, if one has a rational basis for selecting one reading over another at all points of variation, there is no need for one text to be designated as "copy-text" at all. In this conception, therefore, copy-text is a text more likely than any other—insofar as one can judge from all available evidence—to contain authorial readings at points where one has no other basis for deciding. The usual deterioration of a text as it is recopied suggests that normally the text nearest the author's manuscript is the best choice for copy-text—except, of course, when the circumstances of a particular case point to a different text as the more appropriate choice. All available evidence should be considered by the editor in making these decisions—evidence from the physical analysis of the documents and from the textual analysis of their contents as well as from the editor's own judgment as to what, under the circumstances, the author is likely to have written. Although Greg's proposal is specific, dealing with the printed dramas of the English Renaissance, the spirit of his rationale can, I think, be legitimately extended in this way, providing a comprehensive approach that encompasses other more limited approaches. It allows one to go wherever one's judgment leads, armed with the knowledge of what evidence is available and what systems of analysis have been proposed; and it provides one with a mechanical means of deciding among variants only when all else fails, a means that is still rationally based. One must postulate a relationship among the texts, of course, before one can select and emend a copy-text, and Greg does not suggest in his essay on copy-text how to work out that relationship. His emphasis is different from that of most of the writers on the textual criticism of earlier materials, and in this sense his work is not directly comparable to theirs. But many of them have also talked about the construction of a critical text and have revealed in the process that the two activities cannot always be kept entirely separate. Since the analysis of textual relationships involves judgment at some point, the examination of variants for that purpose is intimately linked with the consideration of variants for emendation. It is not arguing in a circle to decide (having used subjective judgment to some extent) on a particular tree as representing the relationship among the texts, and then to cite that relationship as one factor in the choice among variant readings; the latter is simply a concomitant of the former, for the process of evaluation employed in working out the relationship between the two readings overlaps that used in making a choice between them. Ideally the relationship among the texts should be a matter of fact, which can then be taken as a given in the critical process of deciding what the author wrote. But historical "facts" vary in their degree of certainty; and the more judgment is involved in establishing the "fact" of textual relationship the more such a process will coincide with that of evaluating readings to produce a critical text. The traditional division between recension and emendation is an illustration of this point, though it often has served as a way of concealing it. The open reliance on critical judgment in Greg's rationale and the lack of dogmatism manifested there can appropriately be extended to the prior task of dealing with genealogical relationships. It would seem reasonable to maintain an openness to all approaches that might be of assistance both in evaluating variants and in pointing to relationships. A statistical analysis might prove suggestive, for example, but should be used in conjunction with other data, such as physical evidence. Bibliographical and textual evidence, though undeniably distinct, must be weighed together, since physical details sometimes explain textual variants. Because Greg spoke specifically of copy-texts that were chosen for the relative authority of their accidentals, editors of earlier works—of which the preserved documents are not likely to contain authoritative accidentals—have concluded that his approach is relevant only for works preserved in authorial manuscripts or in printed editions based on them. Such a view does not take into account the natural extension of Greg's position that I have mentioned: the idea of copy-text as presumptive authority, which one accepts (for both accidentals and substantives) whenever there is no other basis for choosing among the variants. This concept of copy-text is relevant for materials of any period, for it is not tied to the retention of accidentals: any feature of the copy-text that one has good reason for emending can be emended without affecting the status of the copy-text as the text one falls back on at points where no such reason exists to dictate the choice among variants. Dearing takes too narrow a view of the matter, therefore, when he says that one chooses a particular text as copy-text if one concludes that the scribes "tended to follow copy even in accidentals" (p. 154). Furthermore, the point is not whether they followed copy; it is simply that the text located at the smallest number of steps from the original is likely to be the best choice to use where the variants are otherwise indifferent, because that text can be presumed, in the absence of contrary evidence, to have deteriorated least, even if the scribes were not careful in following copy. 64 When there are two or more lines of descent, an editor may conclude in a given case that a text in one line, though it is probably more steps removed from the original than a text in another line, is nevertheless more careful and more representative of the original; one would then select it as copy-text, for the point of this approach is that one turns to the text nearest the original only when there is no other evidence for deciding. This procedure, derived from Greg, would seem to be appropriate for all instances in which—if the choice of copy-text is not clear on other grounds—one can decide that a particular text is fewer steps removed from the original than any other known text. It is not helpful, however, in those instances in which two or more texts are an equal, or possibly equal, number of steps from the original. These situations are taken up by Fredson Bowers in an important essay on "Multiple Authority," 65 which is the logical complement to Greg's "Rationale." What is particularly interesting about Bowers's essay is that, although it deals with a problem especially relevant to earlier material, it is occasioned by work on modern literature, specifically Stephen Crane's stories that were published through a newspaper syndicate. 66 In the absence of any of the presumably duplicate copies of the text sent out by the syndicate office, what the editor has are the appearances of the text in the various newspapers that belonged to the syndicate. These are all apparently removed from the syndicate's master proof, and from the author's original, to exactly the same extent; and unless one has other evidence to suggest that one of the newspapers is likely to be more accurate than the others, there is no way to choose one of these texts as carrying presumptive authority. In such cases, therefore, Bowers recognizes that "critical tests (guided by bibliographical probabilities) must be substituted for the test of genealogical relationship" (p. 467). Statistical analysis is important, but, as Bowers says, "quantitative evidence is not always enough" and "qualitative evidence, the real nature of the variant, needs to be considered" (p. 468). What Bowers implies, but does not quite say, is that in such cases there is no copy-text at all, since no text can be elevated over the others and assigned presumptive authority; the critical text is constructed by choosing among readings, at all points of variation, on critical and bibliographical grounds. 67 If one finds two readings evenly matched, there is no copy-text authority to fall back on, and one must settle the dilemma some other way (such as by a statistical analysis to determine which text has apparently been correct most often). This approach to radiating texts, taken in conjunction with the idea of a copy-text of presumptive authority, when the situation warrants, provides a comprehensive plan for dealing with variants. The point that should be stressed is that neither part of this plan is limited to material of a certain type or period. 68 My comments in the preceding pages aim to be nothing more than a series of reflections arising from an effort to think about what connections there are between the textual criticism of ancient writings and the editorial scholarship devoted to modern works. I do not claim to have proposed a new "method"; but I do hope that I have exhibited a coherent line of thinking applicable to all editorial scholarship. The issues will always be debated, and there will always be champions of various approaches. But no approach can survive in the long run that does not recognize the basic role of human judgment, accept it as something positive, and build on it. Welcoming critical judgment is not incompatible with insisting on the use of all possible means for establishing demonstrable facts. Scholarly editors are, after all, historians as well as literary critics, and they must understand the subjective element in the reconstruction of any event from the past. Establishing texts from specific times in the past, including the texts intended by their authors, is a crucial part of this large enterprise of historical reconstruction and cultural understanding. It seems obvious that textual scholars dealing with modern works can benefit from examining the ways in which editors of earlier materials have dealt with complicated problems of transmission and from studying the theories underlying those treatments; I think it equally clear that editors of earlier writings will find relevant what students of later texts have said about authors' revisions and the choice and treatment of a copy-text. One of the textual scholars who have emphasized the importance of cooperation among specialists in different areas is Bruce Metzger. He has urged New Testament scholars, through his own impressive example, to explore textual work in the Septuagint and the Homeric and Indian epics and to "break through the provincialism . . . of restricting one's attention only or chiefly to what has been published in German, French, and English." As he says, "An ever present danger besets the specialist in any field; it is the temptation to neglect taking into account trends of research in other fields. Confining one's attention to a limited area of investigation may result in the impoverishment rather than the enrichment of scholarship." 69 It is to be hoped that many more textual scholars will pursue their work with this same breadth of vision and will welcome the "cross-fertilization of ideas and methods" that results. Editing ancient texts and editing modern ones are not simply related fields; they are essentially the same field. The differences between them are in details; the similarities are in fundamentals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Robert R. Bolgar evocatively describes the situation in the last decades of the nineteenth century: "Textual criticism was the branch of Latin studies that enjoyed most esteem. . . . Successful editors, critics whose conjectures appeared in learned journals or in their adversaria critica were regarded as the leading scholars of their day. They had the stature of paladins in the eyes of their colleagues." See "Latin Literature: A Century of Interpretation," in Les Études classiques aux XIX e et XX e siècles: leur place dans l'historie des idèes , ed. Willem den Boer (1979), pp. 91-126 (quotation from p. 99). 2 W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography , 3 (1950-51), 19-36; reprinted in his Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 374-391. 3 I have attempted to provide a critical survey of these developments in "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," SB , 28 (1975), 167-229 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 245-307), and in "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," SB , 34 (1981), 23-65. Four publications of the Modern Language Association of America contain basic statements about editing that derive from Greg's rationale: The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. James Thorpe (1963; rev. ed., 1970), which contains Fredson Bowers's "Textual Criticism" (pp. 29-54); Center for Editions of American Authors, Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (1967; rev. ed., 1972); The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement (1977; also printed in PMLA , 92 [1977], 586-597); Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. Joseph Gibaldi (1981), which contains G. T. Tanselle's "Textual Scholarship" (pp. 29-52). (In the latter three I have suggested further related reading.) Two other general treatments in this tradition are Fredson Bowers, "Scholarship and Editing," PBSA , 70 (1976), 161-188, and G. T. Tanselle, "Literary Editing," in Literary &amp; Historical Editing , ed. George L. Vogt and John Bush Jones (1981), pp. 35-56. 4 Excellent accounts of the history of classical and biblical textual criticism can be found in Bruce M. Metzger, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration (1964; 2nd ed., 1968); L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature (1968; 2nd ed., 1974); and E. J. Kenney, The Classical Text: Aspects of Editing in the Age of the Printed Book (1974). For the Renaissance humanists, see also M. D. Feld, "The Early Evolution of the Authoritative Text," Harvard Library Bulletin , 26 (1978), 81-111. Some further studies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century developments are listed below in note 38. 5 When I speak of "ancient" (or "early") texts, I include medieval texts, which also normally depend on scribal copies a number of removes from the original (though generally not as many steps removed). 6 The term "textual analysis" has been used—particularly by Vinton A. Dearing (see note 11 below) and James Thorpe (note 39 below)—to refer specifically to the process of establishing the relationships among texts, which is only one of the operations that make up the larger undertaking of "textual criticism." Dearing's use of the term helps him to emphasize that what he is concerned with is the relationship of "messages," not their "transmitters"; but "textual criticism," in which one applies the abstractions of "textual analysis" to the specific instance of verbal texts, can also draw on "bibliographical analysis," the analysis of the physical documents transmitting the texts. I use these terms here with this distinction in mind, though I often employ the more general term where some might prefer the more specific. Whether "analysis" can be wholly objective and can be kept entirely distinct from the larger process of "criticism," in which subjective judgment plays a role, is a debatable question, and is taken up at several points later in this essay. 7 Paul Maas, in his celebrated essay "Textkritik" (note 44 below), as well as many other writers, specifies a step called examinatio between recensio and emendatio (or divinatio ). But examining the recension to determine whether or not it can be regarded as furnishing what the author intended is a necessary first step in the process of deciding when to emend; it is simply a matter of definition whether or not one takes emendatio to comprehend the examination that leads to emendation, and in any case the two are intimately related. As E. J. Kenney concisely notes in his article on "Textual Criticism" in the Encyclopaedia Britannica , 15th ed. (1974), the two activities are "in practice performed simultaneously." (He also recognizes that even recension "entails the application of criteria theoretically appropriate" to examination and emendation.) Maas in fact takes up divinatio in his section entitled "Examinatio." A similar point is implied by Robert Renehan, in Greek Textual Criticism (1969), which aims "to show the textual critic actually at work on a number of specific passages," when he says that his book deals with " examinatio , including both selectio between variants and divinatio " (p. 2). 8 Wayne Cutler, "The 'Authentic' Witness: The Editor Speaks for the Document," Newsletter of the Association for Documentary Editing , 4, no. 1 (February 1982), 8-9. A notorious example of this view, arguing that historical editions exhibit a "respect for historical fact" lacking in literary editions, is Peter Shaw's "The American Heritage and Its Guardians," American Scholar , 45 (1975-76), 733-751 [i.e., 37-55]; his position has been commented on by G. T. Tanselle in "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 (1978), 1-56 ( Selected Studies , pp. 451-506)— cf. SB , 32 (1979), 31-34 ( Selected Studies , pp. 385-388). 9 For an authoritative statement on eclecticism in the editing of modern works, see Fredson Bowers, "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof , 4 (1975), 13-58 (reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography , Text , and Editing [1975], pp. 488-528). 10 See G. T. Tanselle, "Problems and Accomplishments in the Editing of the Novel," Studies in the Novel , 7 (1975), 323-360 (esp. 329-331); see also SB , 34 (1981), 30-31, 55 n.65. 11 An earlier, and much briefer, version of Dearing's book, entitled A Manual of Textual Analysis , appeared in 1959. Two manuals on medieval literature, which appeared later in the 1970s, are Charles Moorman's Editing the Middle English Manuscript (1975), a slight and very elementary book, and Alfred Foulet and Mary Blakely Speer's On Editing Old French Texts (1979), a much more useful and sophisticated treatment. A thorough and learned manual dealing with Italian literature of all periods is Franca Brambilla Ageno's L'edizione critica dei testi volgare (1975). A somewhat earlier manual that is full of common sense and wise observations is Ludwig Bieler's "The Grammarian's Craft: A Professional Talk," Folia , 2 (1947), 94-105; 3 (1948), 23-32, 47-58; 2nd ed., Folia , 10, no. 2 (1956), 3-42 (and as a separate). 12 He specifically mentions its use by "historians, cartographers, musicologists, iconographers, and so on," who will have to "translate from the more literary terminology and examples into their own" (pp. 1-2). 13 For an account of the development of analytical bibliography, see F. P. Wilson, "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography,'" in The Bibliographical Society 1892-1942: Studies in Retrospect (1945), pp. 76-135; it has been reprinted as a separate volume (1970), revised and edited by Helen Gardner. See also my "Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century," in Books , Manuscripts , and the History of Medicine: Essays on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Osler Library , ed. Philip M. Teigen (1982). The central statements of the field are R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927); Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963); and Fredson Bowers, Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). 14 He immediately proceeds to say that the goal of textual analysis is not "merely to provide a genealogy of the states of a text" but, if the state from which all the others descended is not known to be extant, "to reconstruct the latest state from which all the extant states have descended." This goal is proper, but one must remember that reconstructing a text is a very different activity from analyzing the relationships of those that exist. 15 In the 1959 Manual (note 11 above) he considers himself to be introducing this idea: "My method for the first time distinguishes the text conveyed by the manuscript— a mental phenomenon—from the manuscript conveying the text—a physical phenomenon" (p. ix). 16 He does later show his awareness of some of them, as when he cautions against using reproductions, which are "subject to all sorts of unexpected failures to perform their function" (p. 148). In his article on "Textual Criticism" in Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics , ed. Alex Preminger et al. (1965), he properly points out that "early books preserved in only a few copies may differ in every copy." 17 Even if no changes are introduced (a theoretical possibility), the text is still new —though this possibility illustrates what Dearing means by bibliographical thinking, since there is no difference between the two "messages" but only between their "records." Nevertheless, the fact that separately produced texts may happen at times to be identical does not alter the general point that physical details are relevant to textual analysis. 18 Willis neglects the same fact, in his much less sophisticated way, when he claims that, whereas a paleographer is concerned with a manuscript as "a physical entity," to a textual critic "a manuscript is of interest only as a vehicle of readings" (p. 5). 19 Among the many other treatments of scribal error are Willis's (pp. 51-161) and Vinaver's (note 50 below); and Louis Havet, Manuel de critique verbale appliquée aux textes latins (1911). Two classic psychological studies of scribal alterations are Jakob Stoll, "Zur Psychologie der Schreibfehler," Fortschritte der Psychologie und ihrer Anwendungen , 2 (1913-14), 1-133; and Sebastiano Timpanaro, Il lapsus freudiano: psicanalisi e critica testuale (1974; translated into English by Kate Soper, 1976). In the latter, textual study is the basis for a criticism of Freud's theory in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life . 20 James Douglas Farquhar, 'The Manuscript as a Book," in Sandra Hindman and J. D.

Philip Hyatt (1965), pp. 370-389 (reprinted as "Method in Evaluating Scribal Habits . . ." in Colwell's Studies in Methodology in Textual Criticism of the New Testament [1969], pp. 106-124). See also C. H. Roberts, "The Codex," Proceedings of the British Academy , 40 (1954), 169-204; and G. S. Ivy, "The Bibliography of the Manuscript-Book," in The English Library before 1700: Studies in Its History , ed. Francis Wormald and C. E. Wright (1958), pp. 32-65. (An example of an inept effort to base textual decisions on physical evidence is Albert C. Clark's argument, in The Descent of Manuscripts [1918] and other works, that many omissions result from scribes' skipping whole lines, since the lengths of omissions, he believed, often corresponded to multiples of the number of letters in a characteristic manuscript line.) 21 Of course, knowledge of each compositor's habits and reliability is useful in evaluating substantive readings in the part of the text he set, not just in dealing with the spelling and punctuation. 22 For information about ancient punctuation, see the interesting discussions cited in Reynolds and Wilson, Scribes and Scholars (note 4 above), pp. 214-215, 216. 23 "Paradosis" is "a rather imprecise but convenient term meaning 'the data furnished by the transmission, reduced to essentials'" (p. 53). Willis calls it "a pedantic synonym for 'transmitted reading' or for 'reading best attested'" (p. 228). 24 Greg, in his "Rationale" (note 2 above), says that the distinction is not "theoretical" or "philosophic" but "practical," separating two categories toward which scribes or compositors reacted differently; thus even if punctuation affects meaning, "still it remains properly a matter of presentation" (p. 376), for it would normally have been perceived so by scribes and compositors. 25 In itself not a matter about which universal agreement can be expected. 26 For further discussion of the accidentals of manuscript texts, see Bieler (note 11 above), who is sensible on this subject as on much else: his basic point is that "we should always try even in externals [i.e., accidentals] to keep to the original as nearly as evidence warrants and the reader may be reasonably expected to follow" (p. 28), for "the editor should prefer to make his readers think rather than to save them the trouble" (pp. 29-30); it is not proper for editors to insert "the standard punctuation of their mothertongue," and an editor must never "wish to be more consistent than his author" (p. 29). Similarly, S. Harrison Thompson on the classicizing of medieval Latin: "Medieval Latin writers had a right to spell as they wanted to, and we may not change their orthography and put it out under their names" ("Editing of Medieval Latin Texts in America," Progress of Medieval and Renaissance Studies in the United States and Canada Bulletin , 16 (1941), 37-49 (quotation from p. 47). 27 West's phrase "at least for portions of the text," however, indicates that the listing is being thought of more as a suggestive indication of the nature of the spelling variants than as a record of the evidence that was available to the editor and that may be relevant in understanding a particular passage or evaluating the editor's treatment of it. Years earlier MacEdward Leach had made a plea for constructing apparatus so that "the state of the manuscript in the smallest particular can be ascertained" (p. 150); regardless of the editorial alterations made in the text, these details should be available to the reader, because medieval capitalization may not have been haphazard and medieval punctuation "may be important and significant" (p. 147). See "Some Problems in Editing Middle English Manuscripts," English Institute Annual , 1939, pp. 130-151. 28 See R. J. Tarrant's review in Phoenix , 27 (1973), 295-300. 29 Most manuals on manuscript editing of course discuss the form of apparatus; the treatment in the Foulet-Speer manual (note 11 above) emerges from a long tradition of published rules for the medieval French field (and aims to supersede those set forth by Mario Roques in Romania , 52 [1926], 243-249). The Leiden system— Emploi des signes critiques: disposition de l'apparat dans les éditions savantes de textes grecs et latins (1932, 1938)—is an official publication of the Union Académique Internationale and is intended to apply to all kinds of editions, not only those of epigraphical and papyrological interest; O. Stahlin's Editionstechnik (2nd ed., 1914) has long been regarded as standard for classical texts. Two treatments concerned with later materials, but raising some general considerations, are G. T. Tanselle, "Some Principles for Editorial Apparatus," SB , 25 (1972), 41-88 (reprinted in Selected Studies , pp. 403-450); and Fredson Bowers, "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants," SB , 29 (1976), 212-264. 30 Part of this preface is conveniently reprinted in Housman's Selected Prose , ed. John Carter (1961), pp. 23-44 (quotation from p. 36). 31 See Fredson Bowers, "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," Shakespeare Quarterly , 6 (1955), 309-324. 32 Greg's own evolution from a position similar to McKerrow's can in part be seen in "McKerrow's Prolegomena Reconsidered," Review of English Studies , 17 (1941), 139-149, and in the prefaces to the first two printings of his The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942, 1951), as well as in what he sees as the relation of his own "Prolegomena" (pp. viilv) to McKerrow's Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939). 33 He attributes the term to Paul Maas, who used it—somewhat differently—in a review of Greg's The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , in Review of English Studies , 19 (1943), 410-413; 20 (1944), 73-77. After praising the book as "a decisive step forward from McKerrow's orthodoxy towards the eclecticism which the character of the transmission requires" (p. 410) and congratulating Greg on his "courageous vindication of eclecticism" (p. 75), Maas objects to the idea of copy-text and expresses the hope that the "bibliographical school . . . will continue to move towards emancipation from the tyranny of the copy-text" (p. 76). Greg replied (20 [1944] 159-160) that a classicist would naturally object to copy-text, claiming that the concept "has no place in the editing of classical texts," where one is not concerned with preserving documentary accidentals. Cf. note 45 below. 34 Housman (in the Manilius) ridiculed the equation of conservatism with a thoughtless adherence to a single text: "assuredly there is no trade on earth, excepting textual criticism, in which the name of prudence would be given to that habit of mind which in ordinary human life is called credulity" (p. 43). 35 Of course, it is possible to set some other goal for a critical edition; e.g., one could attempt to reconstruct the text of any particular document presumed to have existed but no longer extant. More often, however, the goal of critical editing is the restoration of what the author wished. This goal is still historical, even though the resulting text is not that of any surviving document, and the evidence from all those documents can be reported in the apparatus. 36 One cannot simply say "written by the author," since the author's manuscript may have contained slips of the pen, and the critical editor is aiming for an ideal that may not ever have been realized in any document, even the author's own manuscript. 37 That they should in some cases be more concerned with it than they have been is a separate issue. Even when there is legitimately no question of retaining the accidentals of the manuscript tradition, documentary accidentals may be significant (as I suggested earlier) in assessing the presence of certain substantives and may play a role in the thinking that leads to the choice of a copy-text. 38 In addition to the splendid surveys in Metzger, Reynolds-Wilson, and Kenney (mentioned in note 4 above), other helpful discussions are by Bieler (note 11 above); Edward B. Ham, "Textual Criticism and Common Sense," Romance Philology , 12 (1958-59), 198-215; E. J. Kenney in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (note 7 above); Pasquali (note 45 below); and Robert Marichal, "La Critique des textes," in L'Histoire et ses méthodes , ed. Charles Samaran (Encyclopédie de la Pleiade 11, 1961), pp. 1247-1366. A convenient survey, making particular reference to the Old French field, appears in the Foulet-Speer manual (note 11 above); two useful collections emphasizing medieval texts are Christopher Kleinhenz (ed.), Medieval Manuscripts and Textual Criticism (1976), containing reprinted essays (some translated for the first time), and A. G. Rigg (ed.), Editing Medieval Texts , English , French , and Latin , Written in England (1977), bringing together the papers from the 1976 Toronto editorial conference. For the biblical field, see also Bruce M. Metzger, Chapters in the History of New Testament Textual Criticism (1963), and "Recent Developments in the Textual Criticism of the New Testament," in his Historical and Literary Studies: Pagan, Jewish, and Christian (1968), pp. 145-162; Eldon Jay Epp, "The Twentieth Century Interlude in New Testament Textual Criticism," Journal of Biblical Literature , 93 (1974), 386-414; Frederic G. Kenyon, The Text of the Greek Bible: A Students Handbook (1937; 3rd ed., rev. A. W. Adams, 1975); D. Winton Thomas, "The Textual Criticism of the Old Testament," in The Old Testament and Modern Study , ed. H. H. Rowley (1951), pp. 238-263; and Harry M. Orlinsky, "The Textual Criticism of the Old Testament," in The Bible and the Ancient Near East , ed. G. Ernest Wright (1961), pp. 113-132. 39 One book that does look at the traditions of the textual criticism of early manuscript materials in the context of the study of post-medieval English and American literature is James Thorpe's Principles of Textual Criticism (1972; see "Textual Analysis," pp. 105-130). Thorpe says in his preface, "I believe that the same textual principles are true for all periods and for all literatures" (p. viii). 40 The fullest and most impressive treatment of this point is Sebastiano Timpanaro, La genesi del metodo del Lachmann (1963)—revised from its earlier appearance in Studi italiani di filologia classica , 31 (1959), 182-228; 32 (1960), 38-63. Particularly important forerunners of Lachmann in developing a genealogical approach were the eighteenth-century scholars J. A. Bengel and J. J. Griesbach. 41 E.g., briefly in Reynolds-Wilson (note 4 above), pp. 192-194, and more thoroughly by Ernest C. Colwell, "Genealogical Method: Its Achievements and Limitations,' Journal of Biblical Literature , 66 (1947), 109-133 (reprinted in his Studies in Methodology [note 20 above], pp. 63-83). See also Vinton A. Dearing, "Some Notes on Genealogical Methods in Textual Criticism," Novum Testamentum , 9 (1967), 278-297. E. Talbot Donaldson makes a strong plea for abandoning the Lachmann approach in "The Psychology of Editors of Middle English Texts," in Speaking of Chaucer (1970), pp. 102-118 (see also his complaint about the amount of energy that has been devoted to trying to devise a "scientific system," p. 129). Most of the older standard introductions contain an exposition of Lachmann's method and some criticism of it; among them are Kirsopp Lake, The Text of the New Testament (1900; 6th ed., 1928); R. C. Jebb in A Companion to Greek Studies , ed. Leonard Whibley (1905); 4th ed., 1931); J. P. Postgate in A Companion to Latin Studies , ed. J. E. Sandys (1910, 1913, 1921), and in the Encyclopaedia Britannica , 11th ed. (1911); F. W. Hall, A Companion to Classical Texts (1913); and Hermann Kantorowicz, Einführung in die Textkritik (1921). 42 On the place of "common error" in Lachmann's own work, see Kenney (note 4 above), p. 135 n. 1. 43 Colwell, after saying that Westcott and Hort did not actually apply the genealogical method to New Testament manuscripts, adds, "Moreover, sixty years of study since Westcott and Hort indicate that it is doubtful if it can be applied to New Testament manuscripts in such a way as to advance our knowledge of the original text of the New Testament" ( Studies in Methodology [note 20 above], p. 63). Colwell believes that the method is useful only for closely related families of manuscripts "narrowly limited in time and space" (p. 82). 44 Einleitung in die Altertumswissenschaft , 1 (3rd ed.), part 7 (1927), 18 pp.; separate editions appeared in 1950 and 1957. The 1958 English edition ( Textual Criticism ) includes a translation of Maas's "Leitfehler und stemmatische Typen," Byzantinische Zeitschrift , 37 (1937), 289-294. (For the Italian translation, Critica del testo , see note 49 below. Some comments on the influence of Maas in Italy and France appear in Luciano Canfora, "Critica textualis in caelum revocata," Belfagor , 23 [1968], 361-364.) 45 It is likely, of course, that a scribe would depart from his exemplar, but not that his departures would be such that no other scribe might hit on them independently. Maas, because his name is linked with the abstract and theoretical statement of stemmatics, is sometimes—but wrongly—thought to represent rigidity and an opposition to individual judgment. The truth is altogether different, as illustrated by his review of Greg (note 33 above), which includes the remark, "Misuse of conjecture is not more probable than misuse of conservatism, and is perhaps less dangerous" (p. 76). Giorgio Pasquali's long review of Maas in Gnomon , 5 (1929), 417-435, 498-521, was the predecessor of his great book, Storia della tradizione e critica del testo (1934; 2nd ed., with a new preface and appendixes, 1952). Pasquali's position (along with that of Michele Barbi, La Nuova Filologia e l'edizione dei nostri scrittori da Dante al Manzoni , 1938) in the Italian school of "new philology" is concisely described by Mary B. Speer in a review of two other books in Romance Philology , 32 (1978-79), 335-344; she notes their reaction against the rigidity of Maas's stemmatics and their emphasis on critical judgment as a scholarly and responsible procedure. 46 Sometimes it begins sooner, if one has difficulty determining some of the readings present in a particular document. 47 Bédier extended his discussion in "La Tradition manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre: reflexions sur l'art d'editer les anciens textes," Romania , 54 (1928), 161-196, 321-356; and in "De l'Édition princeps de la Chanson de Roland aux éditions les plus récentes: nouvelles remarques sur l'art d'établir les anciens textes," Romania , 63 (1937), 433-469; 64 (1938), 145-244, 489-521. For an example of the voluminous later commentary on Bédier, see Frederick Whitehead and Cedric E. Pickford, "The Introduction to the Lai de l'Ombre : Sixty Years Later," Romania , 94 (1973), 145-156 (also published in Kleinhenz [note 38 above], pp. 103-116). Whitehead and Pickford find that textual criticism in the Old French field has "moved decisively away from the phase of extreme conservatism" (p. 156) associated with Bédier and has returned "to procedures familiar to textual critics in the classical field but completely lost to sight by editors of French medieval texts at the turn of the century" (p. 155). 48 By William P. Shepard (note 58 below), p. 140. 49 In his introduction to Nello Martinelli's translation (1952, 1958), of Maas's Textkritik . 50 "Principles of Textual Emendation," in Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature Presented to Professor Mildred K. Pope (1939), pp. 351-369 (reprinted in Kleinhenz [note 38 above], pp. 139-159). 51 Vinaver argues ineffectually with Housman later in the essay, twisting Housman's point in order to claim that it " is right to preserve a reading as long as it is possible that it comes from the original" (p. 368). 52 Vinaver is criticized by Henry John Chaytor, in "The Medieval Reader and Textual Criticism," Bulletin of the John Rylands Library , 26 (1941-42), 49-56, for assuming that scribes had "visual memory" rather than "auditory memory"—a difference that would affect the kinds of errors they made. Another effective criticism of Vinaver is provided by T. B. W. Reid, in "On the Text of the Tristran of Béroul," in Medieval Miscellany Presented to Eugène Vinaver by Pupils , Colleagues and Friends , ed. Frederick Whitehead, A. H. Diverres, and F. E. Sutcliffe (1965), pp. 263-288 (esp. pp. 269-272); reprinted in Kleinhenz (note 38 above) pp. 245-271 (esp. pp. 252-254). (On scribal errors, see note 19 above.) See also George Kane's defense of emendation, in opposition to Vinaver and Bédier, in "Conjectural Emendation," in Medieval Literature and Civilization: Studies in Memory of G. N. Garmonsway , ed. D. A. Pearsall and R. A. Waldron (1969), pp. 155-169 (reprinted in Kleinhenz [note 38 above], pp. 211-225); and in his editions of the A and B versions of Piers Plowman (1960, 1975, the latter with E. Talbot Donaldson). 53 What it really does, however, is to provide the editor with information that may be of assistance in making a critical judgment. Knowing that a category of error exists may help the editor to recognize an instance of it, but one cannot assume that all possible instances of it are in fact errors. The editor must still decide whether a particular reading, in a particular context, is best explained as falling into one of those categories, or whether it need not be regarded as an error at all. 54 See Frederick Whitehead and Cedric E. Pickford, "The Two-Branch Stemma," Bulletin bibliographique de la Société internationale arthurienne , 3 (1951), 83-90. Cf. Jean Fourquet, "Le Paradoxe de Bédier," Mélanges 1945 (Strasbourg, 1946), 2:1-16; and "Fautes communes ou innovations communes," Romania , 70 (1948-49), 85-95. 55 Further elaborated in his Essais de critique textualle (ecdotique) (1926). 56 For more detailed criticism of Quentin, see E. K. Rand, "Dom Quentin's Memoir on the Text of the Vulgate," Harvard Theological Review , 17 (1924), 197-264; and J. Burke Severs, "Quentin's Theory of Textual Criticism," English Institute Annual , 1941, pp. 65-93. Bédier's 1928 criticism is cited above (note 47). The Quentin-Bédier controversy is treated in a number of well-known books, such as Paul Collomp, La Critique des textes (1931) and Arrigo Castellani, Bédier avait-il raison? (1957). 57 The importance of the Calculus as a starting point for further thinking about objective methods of analysis, however, is recognized in the work of Dearing and Hrubý, commented on briefly below, and in F. M. Salter's critical but balanced review of Greg's edition (1935) of The Play of Antichrist in Review of English Studies , 13 (1937), 341-352 (to which Greg replied at 13 [1937], 352-354, and 14 [1938], 79-80). 58 "Recent Theories of Textual Criticism," Modern Philology , 28 (1930-31), 129-141. Greg replied to Shepard's criticisms (28 [1930-31], 401-404), emphasizing the distinction between the "mechanism of transmission," with which he was dealing, and the reconstruction of texts, which he acknowledges cannot be mechanical. 59 Hill, "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts," SB , 3 (1950-51), 63-95; Hrubý, "Statistical Methods in Textual Criticism," General Linguistics , 5 (1961-62), 77-138; Hrubý, "A Quantitative Solution of the Ambiguity of Three Texts," SB , 18 (1965), 147-182 (the opening pages of which offer a good survey of the statistical tradition); Dearing, Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (1974; see part I above and note 11). Other quantitative approaches involving the tabulation of agreements are represented by Ernest C. Colwell (e.g., several of the papers collected in his Studies in Methodology [see note 20 above]), Paul R. McReynolds (e.g., "The Value and Limitation of the Claremont Profile Method," in the 1972 volume of the Society of Biblical Literature seminar papers), and John G. Griffith (e.g., papers on "numerical taxonomy" in Museum Helveticum , 25 [1968], 101-138, and Journal of Theological Studies , n.s., 20 [1969], 389-406); brief comments on Colwell appear in Metzger (see note 4 above), pp. 180-181, and Dearing, pp. 120-121, and on Griffith in West, pp. 46-47 (West's own approach, pp. 38-39, though simpler, is related). For comments on the use of computers in textual analysis, see Dearing, pp. 215-236; Jacques Froger, La Critique des textes et son automatisation (1968); and the works listed in the Center for Scholarly Editions statement (note 3 above), p. 9. 60 Sometimes "contamination" is distinguished from "conflation," the former resulting from the use of now one and now another manuscript, the latter from the combining of elements from two or more manuscripts. In a looser usage, they can be employed interchangeably to refer to the results of a scribe's use of two or more manuscripts. 61 The considerable amount of labor entailed by all these systems, often cited as a criticism, would not be a serious objection, of course, if the results were conclusive. 62 More detailed criticism of Dearing can be found in M. P. Weitzman's trenchant review in Vetus Testamentum , 27 (1977), 225-235. Dearing makes some comments on this review in "Textual Analysis: A Consideration of Some Questions Raised by M. P. Weitzman," Vetus Testamentum , 29 (1979), 355-359. His 1959 book is discussed by David M. Vieth in Journal of English and Germanic Philology , 59 (1960), 553-559 (cf. Harvard Library Bulletin , 24 [1976], 210 n. 14). 63 Among the notable features of Bieler's essay (note 11 above) is his discussion suggesting situations in which various of these approaches might be appropriate. 64 Dearing says, "In fact, Greg's rule implies that scribes and compositors tend to follow copy in accidentals. If the evidence is clear that they did not, then any extant text may be the most like the author in the matter of accidentals, and the bibliographical tree does not limit the editor's choice of copy-text" (p. 155). It would be more accurate to say that Greg assumes deterioration as one text is copied from another and believes, when no other evidence is available, that more of the author's practices are likely to show through in the earliest copy. As Dearing implies, it would be possible for a later copyist, being unfaithful to the deteriorated text he is copying from, to happen to reintroduce a number of authorial practices. But they would carry no more authority than the editor's own decision to introduce them—unless, of course, there were reason to believe that the copyist had drawn on a more authoritative document, in which case the editor would have good cause to select the text containing them as copy-text. Greg would agree that "the bibliographical tree does not limit the editor's choice of copy-text," for he never argued for following a mechanical rule if the evidence, as one sees it, points another way. 65 "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115; reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 447-487. 66 Bowers also speaks of carbon copies from typewriting—another modern phenomenon that can produce radiating texts. 67 I have explored this point, and its implications for the recording of variants, in "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts," Library , 5th ser., 29 (1974), 330-337. Dearing —both in Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (p. 154) and in "Concepts of Copy-Text Old and New," Library , 5th ser., 28 (1973), 281-293 (p. 291)—continues (as does Bowers) to use the term "copy-text" in these situations, but he confuses the concepts of "copy-text" and "printer's copy," as when he says (in the article) that "if we can completely reconstruct the archetype, any copy-text is as good as any other and we need only choose the one we must change the least to bring it into conformity with the archetype." What is being chosen in such a case is not a copy-text but a text that can conveniently serve as the basis for printer's copy; indeed, at the beginning of the article Dearing defines "copy-text" as "what a scholar-editor sends to the press." The necessity for maintaining a distinction between "copy-text" and "printer's copy" is shown, I hope, in my "The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note," SB , 23 (1970), 191-196. 68 Another point that should perhaps be repeated to avoid misunderstanding: what I have said here does not purport to summarize Greg and Bowers but tries to extend their ideas in a direction suggested by their essays. 69 Chapters (see note 38 above), pp. ix and 142 respectively. This statement would in fact serve well as the motto for the Society for Textual Scholarship, founded by David Greetham in 1979; some remarks of mine along the same lines appear at the beginning of the first volume of Text (1981), the Society's publication. Forty years ago R. W. Chapman indicated some connections between the editing of ancient and of modern works, in "A Problem in Editorial Method," Essays and Studies , 27 (1941), 41-51.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Four New Fielding Attributions: His Earliest Satires of Walpole by Martin C. Battestin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My purpose here is to claim for the Fielding canon four new, and rather surprising, pieces from the earliest period of his authorship. In subject and manner, all four are characteristic of Fielding. What may be unexpected about them—considering his overtures to Walpole and the Court in roughly the same period—is that they appeared in Opposition journals and are openly satirical of the Prime Minister, though in varying degrees of severity. The two earliest items—a ballad entitled "The Norfolk Lanthorn" and an epistolary essay on "the Benefit of Laughing "—were published during the summer of 1728 in, respectively, The Craftsman (20 July) and Mist's Weekly Journal (3 August). The latter two—in the form of letters from the sharp-sighted physiognomist "Thomas Squint" and from the Norfolk squire "Harry Hunter," who expounds upon the analogy between hunters and politicians—appeared in the summer and autumn of 1730 in, respectively, Fog's Weekly Journal (25 July) and The Craftsman (10 October). Since Fielding did not publish these pieces under his own name or otherwise acknowledge that he wrote them, and since—with perhaps the tantalizing exception of "The Norfolk Lanthorn"—his contemporaries are silent on the matter, the case for his authorship must rest almost entirely on internal evidence. In a moment, therefore, we will examine these works in some detail, noting in each the characteristic features of Fielding's style and thought. First, however, it will be helpful to review the biographical circumstances in which Fielding wrote them—at a time in his career when we might have expected to find him praising Caesar not blaming him. When Fielding, well before his twenty-first birthday, tried to establish himself as a poet and playwright in London, he understood that his best hopes for prospering lay with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, his second cousin and a close friend of Sir Robert Walpole. To her in 1727 he submitted the manuscript of his first play, Love in Several Masques , for criticism; and in November of that year—the commencement of his career as an author happily coinciding with George II's accession to the throne—he published together under his own name a pair of poems celebrating the new king's coronation and birthday. 1 Owing no doubt to the sponsorship of Lady Mary, to whom the play is dedicated, Love in Several Masques was produced, we may further note, in February 1728 at Drury Lane, the Theatre Royal, whose steady affiliation with the Court Interest made it a standing target for Opposition writers. In March of that year Fielding interrupted his literary career in order to begin his studies at the University of Leyden in Holland. He did not remain abroad many months, however, as is clear from his poem, "A Description of U[pto]n G[rey]" written some time "in the Year 1728," presumably during the summer vacation. It was possibly in the same season a year later, when he returned to England after completing his studies, that he visited Lady Mary at Twickenham and sketched out those mock-epic cantos that so faithfully reflect her own political and literary prejudices—cordially praising Walpole and the Royal Family, and roundly satirizing both the Scriblerus circle of Pope, Swift, Gay, and Bolingbroke, and the editors of The Craftsman and Fog's Weekly Journal . These cantos, as Isobel Grundy observes, surely "represent a bid for [Lady Mary's] patronage and perhaps, through her, for that of Walpole." 2 But these hopes, for the time being at least, came to nothing. No doubt unimpressed by the distinctly modest success of Love in Several Masques , the managers at Drury Lane rejected Fielding's next offerings. To find a stage for his second play, The Temple Beau (January 1730), he was forced to go to the new City theatre in Goodman's Fields, and from there to throw in his lot with the still less prestigious company of rogue comedians at the little Theatre in the Haymarket. Here it was that he succeeded brilliantly by giving the Town what he was convinced it preferred to regular comedy—farce and burlesque: The Author's Farce in March and Tom Thumb in April. Though some critics have discerned in these plays signs of Fielding's disenchantment with Walpole, Professor Goldgar is certainly correct in regarding them as essentially unpolitical. In The Author's Farce , though Fielding mocks such ministerial creatures as Cibber and Henley and Theobald, his overt political strokes are few and they are directed equally at the Opposition and the Court. As for Tom Thumb , not only was the usually alert Earl of Egmont unable to detect any ridicule of Walpole in the play; the Great Man himself so much enjoyed the burlesque that he attended three performances. 3 In its expanded form, as The Tragedy of Tragedies , the play indeed was considered so inoffensive politically that it was revived at Drury Lane after Fielding had returned to that company in 1732. Whether or not the minister's contributing to the successful original run of Tom Thumb can in itself fairly be construed as his patronage of Fielding, as the Opposition journalists believed, we may surely infer from Fielding's verse epistle to Walpole, "Written in the Year 1730," that he was courting his favor at about this time: in that poem, addressing Walpole, he refers to himself as "Your Bard" and angles, however facetiously, for some government " Sinecure ." 4 His friendship with James Ralph, Lewis Theobald, and Thomas Cooke—all of whom were associated with the Court Party— stems, moreover, from this same period. 5 Indeed, as Goldgar has shown (pp. 105-10), the first real indication of anything like an anti-Walpole bias in Fielding's known writings is not to be found until the Haymarket production of Rape upon Rape (later called The Coffee-House Politician ) in June 1730: this play, thematically the most earnest of Fielding's regular comedies to date, satirizes lewdness and corruption in the magistracy—a subject reflecting on the recent scandal involving the infamous Col. Charteris and the man who was said to have "screened" him from justice, Sir Robert Walpole. But even here Fielding's satire, though pointed enough in its castigation of vice in high places, hits Walpole only obliquely. Judging strictly from what we have known of his published work, it would seem in fact that Fielding scrupulously avoided sensitive political subjects until, almost a year later, he produced The Welsh Opera (soon retitled The Grub-Street Opera ) in April 1731 at the Haymarket Theatre. This play, which ridicules not only Walpole and party politics, but the Royal Family! was almost certainly quashed by the government; and it no doubt contributed to the demise of the Haymarket company, whom the authorities prosecuted later that year for producing the thinly disguised anti-Walpole drama, The Fall of Mortimer . It is curious, to say the least, that while the ministry was hounding the Haymarket players out of existence, the author of The Grub-Street Opera escaped unscathed. Indeed, after publicly dissociating himself from the publication of the play, 6 he would reappear six months later as nothing less than the principal dramatist of the Establishment's own theatre, Drury Lane. It may be that his second versified appeal for Walpole's patronage (dated 1731) was written in the latter part of that year. In any event, so thick was Fielding with the Court Party at this time that he could be counted on to supply the epilogue to The Modish Couple (produced at Drury Lane in January 1732)—a feeble comedy damned by the Opposition both at the theatre and in the press because, though supposedly written by the courtier Capt. Charles Bodens, the real authors were known to be Lord Hervey and the Prince of Wales. And when Fielding's own comedy, The Modern Husband , appeared the following month it was published with a Dedication to the Prime Minister himself, a circumstance which for some time thereafter subjected Fielding to the relentless abuse of The Grub-Street Journal . With but two exceptions, then—the productions of Rape upon Rape in June 1730 and of The Welsh Opera in April 1731—Fielding's known writings of this early period are either entirely unconcerned with political matters or indiscriminate in directing incidental shafts at either party—or, as in the instances of the poems addressed to Walpole in 1730 and 1731, and the Dedication to The Modern Husband in 1732, they are openly complimentary of the minister. At first glance it would seem improbable therefore that Fielding could be the author of the four satires which are the subject of this essay. The fact is, however, that Fielding, who was very free with his money and had to earn with his pen what he could get of it, took a pragmatic view of his talent. We may recall, for instance, his well-known declaration in The Jacobite's Journal (26 March 1748) that "a Writer, whose only Livelihood is his Pen," must, like "every other Advocate," be allowed the right to sell his services to those who will pay for them: To confess the Truth, the World is in general too severe on Writers. In a Country where there is no public Provision for Men of Genius, and in an Age when no Literary Productions are encouraged, or indeed read, but such as are season'd with Scandal against the Great; and when a Custom hath prevailed of publishing this, not only with Impunity but with great Emolument, the Temptation to Men in desperate Circumstances is too violent to be resisted; and if the Public will feed a hungry Man for a little Calumny, he must be a very honest Person indeed, who will rather starve than write it. In a Time therefore of profound Tranquillity, and when the Consequence, at the worst, can probably be no greater than the Change of a Ministry, I do not think a Writer, whose only Livelihood is his Pen, to deserve a very flagitious Character, if, when one Set of Men deny him Encouragement, he seeks it from another, at their Expence; nor will I rashly condemn such a Writer as the vilest of Men, (provided he keeps within the Rules of Decency) if he endeavours to make the best of his own Cause, and uses a little Art in blackening his Adversary. Why should a Liberty which is allowed to every other Advocate, be deny'd to this? Twenty years earlier, as a wild young man whose only saleable commodity was a talent to amuse, Fielding was doubtless no more inclined to play the idealist in such a mercenary game as politics. One may suppose that his own sentiments on the subject conformed pretty closely to those of his surrogate, "Scriblerus Secundus," author of The Grub-Street Opera , who explains to the Master of the Playhouse how it can be that the Grub-Street brethren should "pull one another to pieces as you do, especially in your political pamphlets": SCRIBLERUS. . . . alas, you mistake altercation or scolding a little in jest, for quarreling in earnest. Sir, was you ever at Westminster Hall? MASTER. Often, sir. SCRIBLERUS. Did you never hear our people scold there? MASTER. I have heard the lawyers. SCRIBLERUS. The lawyers! Why those are our people; there hath long been the strictest union between Grub Street and the law. Thus our politicians are as good friends as our lawyers, behind the curtain. They scold and abuse one another in the persons of their masters and clients, and then very friendly get drunk together over their booty. Our people no more quarrel in earnest than they quarrel with civility. Why sir, you might as well suppose Robin and Will, in my opera, to be in earnest. 7 Given this recognition of the realities of authorship and the patronage system, we should not be surprised to hear Fielding confess in The Champion , a paper friendly to the Opposition, that he had once been "induced to write certain insipid Things " in Walpole's behalf, or that he had taken Walpole's money "to stop the Publication of a Book" which he had written against him (31 July, 4 October 1740). Nor should we be any more surprised to find him, è converso , turning to the Opposition for encouragement if the minister in his beneficence proved dilatory or insufficient. It is likely that Fielding's reputation for tergiversation in political matters was well deserved; he simply did not regard the unsteadiness of hackney writers in this respect as either morally reprehensible or financially practicable. He was unswerving in his devotion to Whig principles, to be sure; but it never mattered very much to him which Whig was in place so long as he was a friend. In the summer of 1728, as a reckless youth just returned from his travels, what did matter to him, besides the craft of comedy, was the enjoyment of his pleasures and having the money to pay for them. Dating from this period, the first two pieces to be produced below may serve to clarify at last that curious passage from An Historical View of the Principles, Characters, Persons, &amp;c. of the Political Writers in Great Britain (1740), in which the author declares that, at a time before he "set up for a Play-Writer," Fielding had behaved ungratefully to Walpole. Fielding, the writer insists, is a strong Instance of Ingratitude to the Ministry, as he lies under the strongest Obligations to Sir R[obe]rt W[alpo]le , whom he now treats with a Strain of Insolence and Scurrility superior to any other Paper ever went before, not excepting even the Craftsman or Common-Sense . I have some Reasons to know particular Obligations he lies under to the Minister, who once generously reliev'd him by sending him a considerable Supply of ready Money when he was arrested in a Country-Town some Distance from London , and must have rotted in Prison had it not been for this Generosity in the Minister. Soon after he libelled him personally in a Satyr, and next Week had the Impudence to appear at his Levee . Upon Sir R[ober]t 's taxing him with his Ingratitude, and asking him why he had wrote so and so; he answered very readily, that he wrote that he might eat . However Sir R[ober]t still continued his Generosity to him, till he grew quite abandon'd to all Sense of Shame. He then set up for a Play-Writer. . . . (pp. 49-50) Though coming, obviously, from an unfriendly source, this circumstantial account has the ring of authenticity. Certainly one should not too hastily dismiss as malicious gossip the assertion that Fielding as a youth cooled his heels in a jail: the court records of Lyme Regis and Westminster for the period from September 1725 to November 1726 attest that he spent more than his share of time before magistrates explaining the various brawls and violent altercations his hot temper involved him in, the best-known instance of which was his attempt to abduct the young heiress Sarah Andrew. 8 But even those who are prepared to think there may be more truth than slander in this anecdote from the Historical View have found it puzzling. Which "Country-Town" is meant? Why, if the escapade took place in Fielding's usual rural haunts of Dorset, Hampshire, Wiltshire, should he send for aid to Walpole instead of applying to his friends and relations in the West Country? Which of Fielding's satires can the writer be alluding to, when the only one he is known to have published before setting up in earnest as a playwright in 1730, is The Masquerade (January 1728)—a poem ridiculing not Walpole, but a fashionable diversion of the Town? The discovery that Fielding was the author of "The Norfolk Lanthorn," in particular, now enables us to offer plausible solutions to each of these puzzles. The author of the ballad (published on 20 July 1728) states that he has "just returned from a Journey into N[orfolk]," where he has seen the curiosities of Walpole's " Palace ," Houghton Hall—so, too, may Fielding have done if he had returned from Holland for the summer by way of Harwich, the usual route. 9 Walpole was residing at Houghton for a fortnight or so in early July 1728; 10 and had Lady Mary's mischievous cousin become embroiled in yet another brush with the law while in the vicinity, he may well have appealed to Lady Mary's most powerful friend to bail him out. 11 "The Norfolk Lanthorn," which caused much embarrassment to Walpole and his party, would itself nicely fit the description of the "Satyr" in which Fielding is said to have "libelled" the minister "personally"; indeed, that the author of the ballad had defamed Walpole personally in this way was the very point of "Roger Manley's" attack on the poem in the British Journal of 27 July. Furthermore, since the minister, like the author of the satire, had returned to town shortly before "The Norfolk Lanthorn" was published —he arrived in London on Tuesday morning, 16 July, and set out at once to establish himself at Hampton Court for the summer—he might well have had an occasion at his levee the following week to upbraid Fielding for his ingratitude. And finally, if Fielding's authorship of the essay in Mist's Weekly Journal a fortnight later were suspected, the remaining details of the account also fall into place, since Walpole, even after the "Satyr," is said to have continued befriending Fielding "till he grew quite abandon'd to all Sense of Shame." All this is conjecture of course; but it has the virtue of squaring more nearly than any other explanation with the circumstances cited by the author of the Historical View . As we have earlier remarked that among Fielding's known writings Rape upon Rape (June 1730) contains, albeit obliquely, the first definite traces of satiric innuendo against Walpole and his corrupt agents, it will be less surprising that Fielding should be seen to continue in this vein throughout the summer and autumn of that year, when, in the pieces he contributed to Fog's Weekly Journal and The Craftsman , his satire against the minister is for the first time rather more acrimonious than playful. Both these pieces, moreover, relate in interesting ways to the themes of The Modern Husband , which, though not produced until 1732 at Drury Lane, was written much earlier while Fielding was still affiliated with the Haymarket Theatre—written, indeed, just after he had finished Rape upon Rape . 12 Certain parallels between The Modern Husband and Fielding's journalism of this same period suggest, in fact, that in composing this, his darkest dramatic satire against the lewdness and venality of the Great, Fielding originally intended another, more pointed, indictment of Walpole. With "Thomas Squint's" depiction of the minister as an arrogant " Man-Brute " lording it over a throng of abject flatterers, compare, for example, Capt. Merit's bitterness upon being turned away from Lord Richly's levee: "What an abundance of poor wretches go to the feeding the vanity of that leviathan—one great rogue" (I. viii), the phrasing of which would surely have suggested the Great Man himself. 13 Again, "Squint's" perception of the blustering placeman whom he encounters near St. James's—"tho' he could handsomely bully in the Mall , yet he was a very contented C[uckol]d at home"—anticipates not only the central theme of the play, but the very phrasing of Mr. Modern's expostulations with his wife, whose adultery he has connived at: "I have been contented to wear horns for your pleasure . . . . Sure, the grand seignior has no slave equal to a contented cuckold" (I. iv). Mr. Woodall, furthermore, the country M.P. who attends Lord Richly in the play (I. ix), succinctly embodies the analogy between foxhunters and politicians that Fielding draws at length in "Harry Hunter's" letter to The Craftsman . As he composed The Modern Husband Fielding seems to have associated such themes and images with the state of moral debility in government which Walpole (for the moment at least) epitomized. It will now seem less surprising, then, that the earliest "puff" of that play appeared in The Craftsman (19 September 1730) less than a month before the same journal published "Harry Hunter's" satire against the minister and his party. But in the comedy, in contrast to the journalism, Fielding disguised and generalized his satire so successfully that it not only passed the scrutiny of Walpole's friends, Lady Mary 14 and the managers at Drury Lane; it seemed innocuous enough to be presented to Walpole himself with a Dedication in the style of Horace's flattery of Augustus. In brief, then, these are the circumstances, political and personal, in which Fielding wrote the four satires we are about to consider. Before examining the evidence for attributing these pieces to Fielding, however, we should be aware of certain matters affecting the cogency and organization of the argument. To begin with, it will be apparent that two of the pieces in question—those published in Mist's Weekly Journal and its successor Fog's —do not show what has long been regarded as an essential hallmark of Fielding's style: his preference for the archaic verb forms, hath and doth . There are good reasons for this anomaly—which, indeed, with respect to Fielding's writings of this period, is not an anomaly at all. His published works of 1728-30 predominantly show the modern forms, has and does ; and the holograph material that survives from roughly the same period invariably shows the same preference. As the recent discovery of the manuscript of an essay published in Common Sense (13 May 1738) indicates, moreover, compositors of the time were perfectly capable of modernizing his archaisms when he did use them. 15 In the earlier period, however, the evidence might incline us to suspect that a work characterized by these archaisms was not by Fielding, rather than otherwise. But we would then be unable to account for Rape upon Rape (1730) and The Tragedy of Tragedies (1731), which with few exceptions show hath and doth ; and there are passages where these same forms occur in both The Author's Farce (1730) and Tom Thumb (1730). In short, in the face of evidence as contradictory and untrustworthy as this, it will be prudent to abandon the hath/doth test altogether when trying to determine Fielding's authorship of a work written, say, before 1737, when he was forced to give up play-writing for the study of law. A further problem affected the selection and arrangement of the evidence for Fielding's authorship of the four pieces in question. Each of the following four sections provides the full text of the work, together with introductory remarks meant to place it, both thematically and stylistically, in the general context of Fielding's known writings. Since our present purpose is to establish the probability of Fielding's authorship on the basis chiefly of internal evidence, the notes to the texts will be strictly limited to the recording of parallels in Fielding's other works. To this end I have carefully reread all his works published during the fifteen-year period from The Masquerade (1728) to the Miscellanies (1743); in a more selective and cursory way I have reread the works published after that period. It will be apparent that this procedure proved efficacious in identifying numerous parallels between the essay in question and Fielding's known works. Since, however, many of these represent commonplaces of the period, they may seem to some readers to embarrass rather than enhance the case for Fielding's authorship; too many unremarkable parallels tend to confirm the doubts of sceptical readers. Sensing this difficulty, I submitted a draft of this paper to several scholars whose advice I value: in particular, I wish to thank Hugh Amory, James Earle Deese, Irvin Ehrenpreis, Bertrand A. Goldgar, Thomas Lockwood, and Simon Varey—all of whose criticisms I carefully weighed as I tried to give the paper an effective final form. With reference to the quantity of parallels recorded, I have heeded the advice of Professor Deese, a scientist well known for his studies in the psychological bases of language: on the principle that the probability of Fielding's authorship of a given anonymous essay increases in proportion to the number of close correspondences (whether commonplace or otherwise) between that essay and his known writings, I have kept the number of parallels high. To assist the reader in distinguishing between the commonplace and the unusual, however, I have marked with an asterisk those notes which contain striking or distinctive parallels. In order to simplify the citations and to conserve space, page-references, wherever possible, will be to Fielding's Complete Works , ed. W. E. Henley, 16 vols. (1903). Since, however, that edition includes only a selection of Fielding's journalism, references to The Champion, True Patriot, Jacobite's Journal , and The Covent-Garden Journal will be by date only.

      <field name="fulltext">I. "The Norfolk Lanthorn" (July 1728) On Saturday, 20 July 1728, The Craftsman published a rousing little ballad contributed by an anonymous correspondent who, having just returned to town from a visit to Houghton, Sir Robert Walpole's country house in Norfolk, was moved to commemorate in song one of the most conspicuous of the many sumptuous furnishings with which the minister had adorned his " great Palace ." The object that he so particularly admired was a large copper-gilt lantern for eighteen candles which hung in the hall. 1 "The Norfolk Lanthorn," as the poet called it, seemed a fit emblem for the minister's peculiar way of letting his light shine before men, as it were—declaring in its hugeness and opulence both the poverty of his taste and the riches he was amassing at the expense of his country. As slight and playful a thing as it was, the ballad nevertheless struck a nerve. Angry replies appeared at once in the ministerial press. "Veritas" in the Daily Journal (24 July) protested that, in comparing Houghton with Hampton Court and Whitehall, the poet said the thing that was not: it is not a large house, he insisted, and in its excellent construction and design "has the Air of Magnificence of the great Minister, join'd with the Moderation of a very wise one . . . ." On the following Saturday (27 July) the London Journal published " A New BALLAD" in "Answer to the Ballad in last Saturday's Craftsman, call'd, the Norfolk Lanthorn . . . ." And in a leader in the British Journal of the same date "Roger Manley" used the occasion to denounce the Opposition for abusing the liberty of the press in personal libels against the minster: "Men must be treated as being what they are ; and we cannot but despise the little paultry Jingles of a certain Writer on a certain Lanthorn . . . ." That Fielding at about this time had "libelled" Walpole "personally in a Satyr" was also, we will recall, the charge of the author of An Historical View . Indeed, the satiric verses in The Craftsman caught the public fancy to such an extent that a half-century later Horace Walpole, remarking in his copy of Chesterfield's Miscellaneous Works on a reference to Houghton, could declare with some annoyance: Amidst the exaggerations of the Opposition on that fabric, the Lanthorn in the Hall, which was of brass gilt, happened to be most taken notice of. One periodical paper describing the seat, said the Author was first carried into a glass room, which he took for the Porters Lodge, but was told It was only the Lanthorn. This Lanthorn however was so far from being even large enough, that the second Lord Orford sold it, and by a singular fate It was purchased by Ld Chesterfield and was not too large for the staircase of his House in London, where It now hangs. 2 However unfairly the Opposition writers may have represented the lantern's size, it continued to epitomize (depending on one's political point of view) the Patriots' case against the Minister, or the Minister's case against the Patriots' abuse of the press. In 1729, for example, when Richard Savage sought to typify the hireling scribblers of the Opposition, he had "Iscariot Hackney" freely confess to writing "the History of the Norfolk Dumpling , the Verses on the Norfolk Lanthorn , and many other popular Libels on Persons who least deserv'd them . . . ." 3 Three years later the lantern appears as item 11 in the ironic catalogue of Opposition grievances ridiculed in the Daily Courant (27 October 1732); and in a similar satiric vein it is part of the "catalogue of wares" Thomas Newcomb offers for sale to the Opposition, in order to assist them in spreading lies about Walpole. 4 Clearly, "The Norfolk Lanthorn" had an impact on the political wars of the Walpole era far out of proportion to its weight. But why should we accept it as Fielding's work? For several reasons. In the first place, of the four works we are considering "The Norfolk Lanthorn" is the only one that has actually been attributed to Fielding—not (so far as can be known) by a contemporary of his, but nevertheless by a scholar whose claims should not be lightly dismissed: namely, the eminent antiquarian and bibliographer, H. B. Wheatley. In his classic work, London Past and Present (1891), Wheatley makes the following declaration while describing Chesterfield House in Mayfair: "The lantern of copper-gilt for eighteen candles, bought by the Earl of Chesterfield at the sale of Houghton, the seat of Sir Robert Walpole, is celebrated in a once famous ballad by Fielding, in the Craftsman , called 'The Norfolk Lanthorn, a New Ballad'" (I. 388). Typical of the scholars of his generation, Wheatley disdains to document this surprising assertion—which, in due course, was reiterated by W. H. Craig in his Life of Lord Chesterfield (1907) and by the distinguished historian George Rudé. 5 What can have prompted Wheatley to make the attribution? Had he seen an annotated copy of the original number of The Craftsman or of the later versions of the ballad included either in the reprint of that paper (14 vols., 1731-37) or in "Caleb D'Anvers," A Collection of Poems on Several Occasions; Publish'd in the Craftsman (1731)? Or had he come across some contemporary comment on Chesterfield's purchase of the lantern in 1749? Perhaps it is significant that—except for the crucial references to Fielding and to the title of the ballad—all the information Wheatley supplies about the lantern can be found in Horace Walpole's Ædes Walpolianœ , including the facts that it was "for Eighteen Candles" and was "of Copper gilt," that it was ridiculed in The Craftsman in particular, and that it was "sold to the Earl of Chesterfield ." Had Wheatley seen a copy of that work in which this passage had been glossed by some knowledgable contemporary? 6 Certainly, Wheatley, an assiduous antiquarian researcher and cataloguer of libraries, had enviable opportunities for making such a discovery. Indeed, it is hard to imagine why, without some such piece of evidence likely to inspire confidence, Wheatley would have thought to attribute this obscure set of verses to Fielding, who in the years before, say, 1734 had no reputation as a political writer and who has never been suspected of contributing to The Craftsman . Other evidence, admittedly circumstantial, tends to strengthen the case for Fielding's authorship of the ballad. At least once in the later works the lantern at Houghton figures explicitly in his satire of Walpole, who, as Mammon in The Vernoniad (1741), is thus discovered in his "Palace": Within a long recess, where never ray Of light etherial scares the fiends with day, But fainting tapers glimmering pale around, With darkness, their sulphureous steams confound, The dome of Mammon rose, aloft in air, Reflecting through the gloom a golden glare. Here horrour reigns, still miserably great In solemn melancholy pomp of state. A huge dark lantern hung up in his hall, And heaps of ill-got pictures hid the wall. (XV. 40-41) To these verses Fielding adds the following note: This description of Mammon's Palace will hardly strike the reader with so dreadful an image, as it did the translator, I can not forbear mentioning the propriety of these two epithets, huge and dark, applied to the lantern; the former of which expresses the ostentation, and the latter the uselessness of riches: nor can the reader be presented with an idea so capable of inspiring him with a contempt of overgrown wealth, as that of a huge lantern never lighted. A number of correspondences serve to link these passages with the ballad. Like the author of the ballad, the first thing Fielding satirizes about Walpole is his house and its furnishings, particularly the lantern, which serves as a symbol of the minister's conspicuous wealth and power. Both writers associate the lantern with the same descriptive qualities: in the preface to the ballad, the author speaks of the lantern as being "huge" and he invites us to contrast it to a certain " little, dark Lanthorn "; 7 similarly, in his footnote Fielding stresses "the propriety of these two epithets, huge and dark, applied to the lantern . . . ." Both writers, moreover, refer to Houghton as a "Palace"; both place the lantern in the "Hall." And both, in order to multiply ocular proofs of Walpole's unseemly opulence, add to the symbol of the lantern itself the evidence of the minister's expensive collection of paintings—that "great Variety of fine Pictures ," as the balladeer calls them; those "heaps of ill-got pictures," as The Vernoniad has it. A further (and splendidly esoteric) instance of Fielding's use of the lantern at Houghton as a symbol of Walpole's bad eminence occurs in that enigmatic farce, Tumble-Down Dick: or, Phaeton in the Suds (1736), performed originally at the Haymarket Theatre as an afterpiece to Pasquin — the play that inaugurated Fielding's final, brilliant campaign as a theatrical satirist, against Walpole in particular and against corrupt politicians in general. In Tumble-Down Dick Apollo, god of the sun, is represented as a watchman sitting in a great chair in the roundhouse, where he keeps a large lantern, the emblem of his power, and is attended by a band of followers. No one acquainted with contemporary political satire will need to be supplied with a key to this allegory. Apollo is of course Walpole. The roundhouse—which "Machine," the composer of the little drama, informs us is meant to represent "the Palace of the Sun" (XII. 16)—is Houghton. And the lantern, though representing Apollo's "chariot," as "Machine" assures us, is also meant to recall that other, larger lantern that hung in the hall at Houghton. This connection is enforced, for example, when, having disastrously scorched the country, "Phaeton falls " (according to the stage directions) " and the lanthorn hangs hovering in the air " (XII. 24). But those members of the audience with a keen memory might have made the connection sooner if, when Clymene advises Phaeton, "Go to the watch-house, where your father bright / That lanthorn keeps which gives the world its light . . ." (XII. 16), they had called to mind the prayer of the balladeer "That this Lanthorn may spread such an Illumination, / As may glare in the Eyes of the whole British Nation." And as Phaeton's eyes dazzle upon entering the roundhouse—"What do I see? What beams of candle-light / Break from that lanthorn and put out my sight?" (XII. 17)—those same members of the audience might have recalled the balladeer's own reaction upon visiting Houghton for the first time, who "was so much delighted with the Sight of an huge and sumptuous Lanthorn, which immediately struck my Eyes, upon entering the great Hall . . . ." That Fielding, in Tumble-Down Dick and The Vernoniad , should thus apply the lantern at Houghton to the same satiric purpose as that evident in the ballad which first made it famous does not of course prove him to be the author of the ballad. But we can agree, I think, that this ludicrous manifestation of Walpole's greatness held a special fascination for him. (Indeed, the "Home News" column of The Champion for 15 July 1740 reduces Houghton, by metonymy, to merely "the Lanthorn-House in Norfolk.") But not only do Fielding and the author of the ballad share this common interest; the lantern evokes in their minds similar ideas and associations, which they express in similar turns of phrase. One of these in the ballad is quite distinctive, yet it occurs more than once in Fielding's known writings: thus, in the last line of Stanza VI, the author hopes that the lantern's illumination "may glare in the Eyes" of the British nation. Twice in Fielding's Miscellanies this same expression appears: in the "Essay on Nothing" ("this dignity . . . glares in the eyes of men" [XIV. 316]) and in Jonathan Wild ("the absurdity . . . glared in his eyes" [II. 125]). For these reasons, then, Wheatley's attribution of "The Norfolk Lanthorn" to Fielding seems well founded. The text follows; the notes appended to the text will serve to supplement the correspondences with Fielding's known writings already cited above. To CALEB D'ANVERS, Esq; Ex Pede Herculem . 1 Sir, I am just returned from a Journey into N[orfolk], 2 where I have at length satisfied my Curiosity in viewing a certain great Palace , which hath occasioned so much Discourse in Town, and by far exceeded the most sanguine of my Expectations. A particular Description of the Magnificence of the House, Gardens and Stables , as well as of the great Variety of fine Pictures , the vast Quantities of Massy Plate and other costly Furniture would require a Volume in Folio, 3 which I hope some Person, who hath more Opportunity and Leisure than my self, will undertake. But I was so much delighted with the Sight of an huge and most sumptuous Lanthorn, which immediately struck my Eyes, upon entering the great Hall , that I could not forbear celebrating it in a few Stanza's, which (as trifling as they may seem) will serve to fill up a little Vacancy in your Paper and may, perhaps, do well enough by way of Contraste to the Remarks on a little, dark Lanthorn , which we were lately desired to take Notice of in our Common Prayer Books . I am , &amp;c. The NORFOLK LANTHORN. A new Ballad, To the Tune of, Which nobody can deny . I. In the County of Norfolk , that Paradise Land, Whose Riches and Power doth all Europe command, There stands a great House (and long may it stand!) Which nobody can , &amp;c. II. And in this great House there is a great Hall; So spacious it is and so sumptuous withal, It excells Master Wolsey's Hampton Court and Whitehall , Which nobody can , &amp;c. III. To adorn this great Room, both by Day and by Night, And convince all the World that the Deeds of Sir Knight Stand in Need of no Darkness , there hangs a great Light , Which nobody can , &amp;c. IV. A Lanthorn it is, for its Splendour renown'd, 'Tis Eleven Feet high and full Twenty Feet round, And cost, as they say, many a fair hundred Pound, Which nobody can , &amp;c. V. The King, Sir, (God bless Him!) who lives in the Verge, Could hardly afford the exorbitant Charge Of a Palace so fine, or a Lanthorn so large. Which nobody can , &amp;c. VI. Now let us all pray (though its not much in Fashion) That this Lanthorn may spread such an Illumination, As may glare in the Eyes 4 of the whole British Nation. Which nobody should deny .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. On the Benefit of Laughing (August 1728) On 3 August 1728, just a fortnight after "The Norfolk Lanthorn" caused such a stir among readers of The Craftsman , there appeared in Mist's Weekly Journal , the other principal organ of the Opposition, an essay "upon the Benefit of Laughing " contributed by a certain facetious correspondent who, though he is ready enough to have fun at Walpole's expense, is more inclined to amuse the public than to embarrass the minister. The writer who, having recently returned from his "Travels" is soon "to cross the Channel" again, represents himself as a most peculiar sort of physician—one able, indeed, to "cure all Diseases incident to the Mind and Body of Man by a Laugh ." Though choosing to remain anonymous, this odd doctor of mirth may be confidently identified as Henry Fielding—soon to embark again for Holland to resume his studies, but already launched upon a literary career that would establish his reputation as one of England's greatest comic authors. How fitting, therefore, that by celebrating the therapeutic properties of laughter, this his first published essay should serve as a kind of overture to the comic masterpieces to come. Though in attributing this essay to Fielding we must rely entirely on internal evidence, the amount of such evidence is plentiful—to the extent that no attempt could be made in the notes to adduce all the relevant parallels. Consider, to begin with, the general theme of the essay, which is one Fielding made peculiarly his own. It precisely anticipates, for example, that passage in the Preface to Joseph Andrews in which Fielding adapts to comedy Aristotle's medical metaphor of a tragic catharsis , purging the audience of the passions of fear and pity. Burlesque, Fielding would write in his famous Preface, contributes more to exquisite mirth and laughter than any other; and these are probably more wholesome physic for the mind, and conduce better to purge away spleen, melancholy, and ill affections, than is generally imagined. Nay, I will appeal to common observation, whether the same companies are not found more full of good-humor and benevolence, after they have been sweetened for two or three hours with entertainments of this kind, than when soured by a tragedy or a grave lecture. (I. 20) Variations on this same theme are often heard in Fielding's early work—as in these lines from the prologue to The Author's Farce (1730): In days of yore, when fools were held in fashion . . . A merry jester had reformed his lord, Who would have scorned the sterner Stoic's word. Bred in Democritus his laughing schools, Our Author flies sad Heraclitus' rules: No tears, no terror plead in his behalf; The aim of Farce is but to make you laugh. (VIII. 193-194) In The Mock-Doctor (1732) we are similarly assured that the physician who can bring his patient to smile has cured him (X. 156); and later in that play Gregory, to cure Charlotte, instead of disagreeable medicines prescribes a song: "Is there any thing so strange in that? Did you never hear of Pills to purge Melancholy?" (X. 168). Compare, too, Fielding's anatomy of laughter in "An Essay on the Knowledge of the Characters of Men" (1743), where he again emphasizes its beneficial effects: "laughter, while confi[n]ed to vice and folly, is no very cruel punishment on the object, and may be attended with good consequences to him . . ." (XIV. 286). Or finally, consider how Fielding in The Champion (27 March 1740) applies the same metaphor to the case of satire and ridicule: "If the mind be only tainted with one particular vice, this is but a potion given to our disease; and though it may be attended with some pain in the operation, the satirist is to be regarded as our physician, not our enemy . . . ." Not only is the general theme of the curative power of laughter associated distinctively with Fielding's theory of comic catharsis . In its particular patterns of thought as well the essay recalls Fielding at virtually every turn: his anatomy of the kinds of laughter here resembles the similar analysis in "An Essay on the Knowledge of the Characters of Men" (XIV. 285-288); his satire of physicians—ridiculing in particular their greed for fat fees, their painful or unpalatable remedies, their way of declining to swallow themselves the medicines they prescribe for others—might serve as a paradigm for his treatment of the "Faculty" throughout his career; as might his milder ridicule of the lady's bad spelling, and her tendency to suffer from the vapors or to amuse herself at quadrille. Numerous passages in his works reveal the same pleasure he here expresses in the antics of monkeys, or the wholesome gaiety of fiddles and country dances, or the cheerfulness induced by witty conversation over a bottle of wine; or in the humor of Butler's Hudibras and Swift's Gulliver's Travels (even, most particularly, in the character of the giantess Glumdalclitch). Many of the essay's rhetorical strategies and turns of phrase, furthermore, correspond to Fielding's usual practice—the pattern of the maid's speech, for example ("Lord, Madam . . . I beg your Ladyship . . . ."); or the occasional bawdy or rude observation; or the humorous use of homely proverbs. And many of Fielding's favorite words, associated with his characteristic habits of thought and description, will be found here as well: the notion, for example, that there are "Degrees" of certain qualities; of an art or science as a "Mystery"; of evil-doing as "Mischief"; of moods being reflected in the "Countenance"; and such favorite adjectives as "good-natur'd," "nauseous," "handsome," "sour" vs. "sweet." It is true of course that, with perhaps the exception of the controlling theme of the essay—the therapeutic properties of laughter, which is such a distinctive feature of Fielding's theory of comedy—no one of these correspondencies is so singular that it could not also be found in other authors of the period. But the occurrence of so many marks of Fielding's thought and style in this essay should establish the case for his authorship beyond reasonable doubt. SIR, 1 Perhaps you'll be surprized to think, that one advanced to my Years should think of engaging with Success in a new Profession, a Profession too which is commonly thought to require some Study; but when I assure you, that my Method is new, and that I am resolved to avoid all the Courses of your modern Practitioners in Physick, you will allow that I may do the World some Service. To let you therefore into the Affair at once, you must know I propose to cure all Diseases incident to the Mind and Body of Man by a Laugh , and therefore it will be necessary that I should make some Remarks upon the Benefit of Laughing , and give a few Examples of some extraordinary Cures perform'd by it. I will own to you, that I took the Hint from an ancient Manuscript, wherein the Author assures us, that he frequently prescrib'd Laughing , and never knew it fail of Success; (he lived before it was the Custom for Physicians to poison their Patients with nauseous Drugs; [)] 2 his Method was to prescribe a small low Laugh , which in our Language is called Te he , 3 and is just two Degrees above a Sneer , 4 with Directions to raise it by Degrees till it came at last to the loud Laugh called the Haugh, haugh , he does not advise it to be taken in Bed, because if the Engines should happen to be weak, or unretentive, the Patient will be in Danger of bep—— himself, 5 a Case that has often happened. But as Men under acute Pains are not to be worked into a Laugh by ordinary Methods, such as the moving of a Feather, or the like, which will operate well enough upon the Muscles 6 of a French Gentleman or Lady, proper Objects must therefore be applied, according to the Design of the Physician, and Strength of the Patient. Sometimes the Conversation of a pleasant Man of Wit, and sometimes the Appearance of a blundering Fellow 7 have had the same Effect, and perform'd the Cure. In my own Practice, I confess, I have found nothing more effectual than the Writings of a certain modern Author, 8 who, though he never laughs himself, has a Knack of making others laugh; in this Way he is like the Gentlemen of the Faculty, who never take any of those Medicines themselves they prescribe their Patients. 9 Let your Patient take up Gulliver's Voyages, and imagine what an odd Figure Nurse Glumdalclitch 10 would make in a modish English Head, of the Dimensions of a Silver Three-Pence, and how charmingly it must become her Baby Face, in Circumference equal to the great Tun of Heidelburg , (for those People were all Roundheads, 11 though the learned Author, out of a Contempt to that Party, is pleased to take no Notice of it,) let him do this, I say, and forbear laughing if he can. I foresee the Gentlemen of the Faculty will endeavour to cry down 12 this my Discovery, (as indeed they will have Reason) because it will certainly lessen the Receipt of high Fees; and when any Person hereafter finds himself indisposed, instead of sending for a Physician, and being at a Guinea Charge, 13 they need only drink a Pint of Wine with a facetious Friend, 14 or read a Page of Hudibras 15 or S——t , and as for Men of Wit, they may cure one another, without any Expence, or Loss of Time whatsoever. But there never was a laudable Design but what was depreciated by those self-interested People who find their Accounts in imposing upon Mankind; but if it be true, as it is commonly said, that the Wisdom of Men, and of particular Nations, is shewn mostly by their Proverbs; 16 I can call in many, which plainly hint at the Vertues of this Medicine, as first, Laugh and be fat , which certainly intimates, that laughing will cure a Consumption. Next, Laugh and be rich . Here you see it is good for the Distempers of the Pocket, as well as for those of the Body. Some Manuscripts, indeed, have it, Drink and be rich , but this last Reading is certainly a Corruption of the Text, and therefore I recommend the first. Then there is Laugh and lye down . But I must give some Persons a Caution how they take it this Way, especially young Maids, because I have known it sometimes followed by a Tympany , 17 therefore great Regard must be had to the Designs of the Physician who prescribes; for what is a salutiferous Medicine 18 in the Hands of one Man, may be Poyson in the Hands of another. But since I have made this Remark, I must observe further, that all Laughs are not to be prescribed; for some are extreamly noxious, 19 as a disdainful Laugh, 20 a malicious Laugh, 21 a treacherous Laugh , which are mostly practiced by Courtiers: There is also a killing Laugh , but this hurts none but Lovers. 22 —Your open Laugh is the most universal Medicine, and attended with no bad Consequences, except that it sometimes discovers a Sett of black Grinders, decayed perhaps by digging into hot Venison Pasty; 23 the sociable Laugh , which is taken by seeing others laugh, is also a very good Laugh . The Secret of raising a Laugh is not known to all, it has sometimes been convey'd by Way of Letter, and the Writer knew nothing of the Matter.—Thus one fair Lady writing to another, was to tell her she had sent her some Pendants for her Ears ;—but as the British Ladies have a peculiar Way of Spelling, 24 she leaves out the first Letter E in the Word E-arse : 25 Her fair Correspondent, who was, at that Time, dying of the Vapours, 26 no sooner came to that Word, but she burst into a Laugh ; her Maid, who was also indisposed, perceiving the Change of Countenance in her Mistress, says, Lord, Madam, it is your handsome 27 Day, I beg your Ladyship to let me have a Sight of that Letter, 28 which being granted, she was also cured upon the Spot; the Lady has now left off sickly Quadrille , 29 and can run about for four Hours together to a Tune of a Fiddle in a Country Dance. 30 I could give innumerable Instances of Cures, but I shall only trouble you with a few, which can be well attested. A certain Person, who had lost both his Wits and his Fortune by an ill Run in the Stocks, 31 was standing at his Window in Suspence, whether he should throw himself out or send for three Pennyworth of Ratsbane, 32 when a Man with a wooden Leg, who is Master of a Company of Players, consisting of one Bear and two Monkeys, 33 happen'd to pass by; they acted a Play, in which the two Monkeys were to decide a Quarrel by Sword and Pistol upon the Back of the Bear, they behav'd so gallantly that both were wounded, so that the fore Leg of each was tied in a Scarf; the whole Scene occasioned so much Laughter, and so diverted his Melancholly [sic], 34 that he immediately applied himself to repair his Affairs, and is now in a Way of making a very good Fortune by an honest Employment (not Stockjobbing.) 35 —The Story of a rich Cardinal at Rome should not be omitted upon this Occasion, who dying of an Imposthume, his Domesticks all began to pillage, even in the Chamber where he lay; his Eminency's Monkey seeing one seize upon this, and the other run away with that, was resolved to have something amongst them, and laid Hold of the Cardinal's Cap, and put it upon his own Head.—The odd Ambition of Pug to be made a Cardinal, so tickled his Eminence, that he burst into a loud Laugh, 36 which broke the Imposthume, and he recovered, to the great Disappointment of the Faculty, who reported him to be a dead Man; 37 —his Eminence ordered a new Chain for his Doctor, and as much Chesnuts as he could eat as long as he lived. It will not be disputed but that this Medicine gives a very agreeable Air to the Countenance.—In my Travels, I my self cured the present Prime Vizier at Constantinople , of a sower starch'd Countenance, 38 which made some of the Ladies of the Seraglio miscarry, and caused him to be dreaded by the Subjects as a Person always disposed to Mischief: He is become the most affable good-natur'd Person alive, never insults Prisoners of State, and indeed has left off taking People up, and is grown such a merry Grig, 39 that he does nothing from Morning to Night but crack Jokes 40 in the Sclavonian Language.—He sent for me to make me some noble Gratifications, but I begg'd his Highness, if he thought I had merited any Thing at his Hands, that he would shew it in some Favours to our Turkey Company,— and I have in Form received their Thanks since my Return from Travel; upon which Occasion their Secretary was pleased to tell me, I had done as much to recover that sinking Trade as all * You'll excuse me, dear Friend, from discovering all the Mysteries 41 of my Art, till after my Patent be pass'd: In the mean Time I can tell you, that in Order to silence all those who shall attempt to cry down my Practice, 42 that I intend to convey a Laugh into 43 the Congress of Soissons , but this, indeed, I will do more to serve my Country than from the Vanity of shewing my Art, not doubting, but it may make the Spaniards good-humour'd, and dispose them to recede from their Demands of certain Restitutions. No Man has these Affairs more at Heart than my self, and I would not have Ministers and Plenipotentiaries patch up a Peace, as Tinkers do old brass Kettles, who in stopping one Hole make half a Dozen, which call for Repair presently after. If you hear of any Body that intends to write against this my Scheme, I desire you will advertise him to do it like a Gentleman and a Scholar, in which Case I will enter the Lists to defend it. The Success of my Practice, I think, will be a good Argument; but as I know that curing the Patient has no Weight in a physical Dispute, I shall therefore prove Galen, Hippocrates, Celsus , 44 and all the Physicians of Antiquity to have been of my Side. As to those who desire no more than to be cured when they are ill, they cannot be so much their own Enemies, 45 as to refuse my Method of Practice; they know the Ease of the Operation, it is but a laughing Matter , and all is well; whereas your regular Quacks attack you with Blisters, Vomits, and Purges, 46 and display a horrid Sight of excruciating Instruments enough to stagger the Resolution of a primitive Saint. 47 —You are ply'd continually with nauseous Draughts, for the Benefit of your Apothecary, so that you are obliged to out-swallow an Ostrich; you must fast when you have a Mind to eat, and eat when you are inclined to fast, 48 and are forbid to laugh, for Fear you should mend, and the Doctor lose his Fees. Whereas my Design is only to ease Mankind from all these Plagues, and to furnish every one with a Laugh, at an easy Rate, according to his Circumstances and the Nature of his Disease; but I have not Leisure to inlarge further, at present, because I am going to cross the Channel, having engaged to add a little Sweetness to the Countenance 49 of a certain Ambassador: A certain Person of Interest, his Relation, having promised 50 to make me Physician to some Body 51 the first Vacancy, which cannot be long; for I take it for granted, that half the Faculty will kick up their Heels and die of the Spleen at the Success of my Practice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The Physiognomist (July 1730) The essay on "the Benefit of Laughing " was, so far as we know, Fielding's last publication before, after another sojourn on the Continent, he "set up for a Play-Writer" in 1730. In June of that year, we will recall, the Haymarket production of Rape upon Rape represented his first serious attempt as a dramatist to satirize—albeit in a manner prudently oblique—corrupt practices peculiarly associated with Walpole. A month later, on 25 July, there appeared in Fog's Weekly Journal a letter from one "Thomas Squint," a public-spirited physiognomist who, having discovered Walpole's character in his countenance, was eager to share his findings with his "Fellow Subjects." Again, though the evidence for Fielding's authorship of this piece is wholly internal, it is plentiful and, I believe, conclusive. Like the previous letter to Mist's on "the Benefit of Laughing ," this one addresses a topic that Fielding, among popular authors of the period, made distinctively his own: namely, the science of physiognomy. 1 The most thorough discussion of the subject in his works opens the "Essay on the Knowledge of the Characters of Men," where, like "Squint," Fielding defends the science from its detractors: "the passions of men," he writes, "do commonly imprint sufficient marks on the countenance; and it is owing chiefly to want of skill in the observer that physiognomy is of so little use and credit in the world" (XIV. 284); "nature," he continues, "doth really imprint sufficient marks in the countenance, to inform an accurate and discerning eye . . ." (288). Though he could observe in The Champion (11 December 1739) that "the doctrine of physiognomy" was "somewhat unfortunate in these latter ages," he was none the less ready, even at the end of his life, to speak up "in favour of the physiognomist." For, he remarks in the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon , "though the law hath made him a rogue and vagabond . . . nature is seldom curious in her works within, without employing some little pains on the outside; and this," he declares in a comment relevant to the present observations of "Tom Squint," is "more particularly" the case "in mischievous characters" (XVI. 236). This is also the opinion of Parson Adams in Joseph Andrews , who insists "that nature generally imprints such a portraiture of the mind in the countenance that a skilful physiognomist will rarely be deceived" (I. 209); and in Tom Jones (IV. 76, 96) both Partridge and Mrs. Whitefield pretend to some "skill in physiognomy." It is worth noting, finally, that the earliest reference to the science in Fielding's acknowledged works occurs less than a year after the present essay, in the Preface to The Tragedy of Tragedies (IX. 11), where, to comfort admirers of Tom Thumb, "Scriblerus Secundus" states that "our English physiognomical writers" have never held that "the greatness of a man's soul is in proportion to that of his body. . . ." Fielding, then, from the beginning of his literary career shared with "Tom Squint" not only an interest in the science of physiognomy, but a willingness to entertain the notion that it could be made to work. Other features of the essay are typical of Fielding as well—the author's pose, for instance, as an "Adept," master of the exact "Rules" of a science, who is so skilled in his art that the uninitiated take him for a "Conjurer," but who is so altruistic that he will publish his discoveries for the benefit of the public. We will also find here one of Fielding's familiar satiric figures, the arrogant Great Man; and here, too, joined in one, will be a pair of other butts well known from his other writings, the oath-swearing "Bully" and the "contented Cuckold." If we enter more closely into the verbal texture of the piece, we will also recognize a number of his favorite expressions, images, patterns of thought: thus "Squint" speaks of the public as his "Fellow-Creatures" and "Fellow Subjects"; he talks confidently of "positive" rules, or contemptuously of the "abject" behavior of Walpole's flatterers; he makes much of removing one's hat as a sign of respect; he is amused at the thought that those who are fated to hang will never drown. But the range and closeness of such correspondences will best be seen in the notes to the text, which follows. To the Author of FOG' s Journal . SIR, Many Years ago I thought it my Duty to bend my Studies to the Good and Advantage of my Fellow-Creatures, 1 and very early I applyed my Mind to find out or improve some Science that might be of Use to the Rest of Mankind. I believ'd that the Science of Phisiognomy [sic] was not at that Height but it was possible to add greatly to it, and tho' it had been exploded and laught at by some ignorant People, yet I believ'd it was possible to settle it on as strong a Basis , and to judge by Rules 2 as certain and positive as those we generally receive from the Royal Society, 3 at least I was resolved to attempt it, and 'tis now, without Vanity, I can assure you, Sir, that my Labour has not been in vain, and I am very ready, when call'd upon, to deliver as certain and infallible Rules, and as real Maxims, for the understanding of this Science, as even the most skilful Decypherers can for the Knowledge of their Art; and tho' some Gentlemen are base enough to suggest that I deal with the Devil , 4 and hold a strict Correspondence with the Pope , yet, Sir, I do assure you, my Art is very innocent, and I act by Rules positive, indisputable, and honest. The Secrets of most Sciences you are sensible, Sir, are not easily comprehended by the Ignorant, 5 and very often they believe we hold an infernal Correspondence, when what we the Adept do is easy with us, without the least Conjuration; I appeal to Mr. Fawks . 6 But to leave this Digression, and to come to Fact. I am, Sir, arriv'd to that Heighth 7 of Knowledge in this Science, with the Help of a little Surgery, that I am able to judge of the Intellects of every individual Person I examine at the Distance of 30 Feet; I can, Sir, at the first Glimpse, distinguish between a Knave and a Fool,—between a Patriot and a Politician, between a Courtier and an Excise-man, between a Pimp and a Custom-house Officer, 8 or between a Gamester and a Senator. This, Sir, is of great Use to me,—and hinders my committing several Blunders in my Addresses to Men of Figure. But, Sir, as, with great Study, Industry and Cost, I am arrived to this Knowledge, I think it my Duty to produce my Art to my Fellow-Christians, and not, like the Tribe of Projectors, consider the Publick a little, and Myself a great deal; I ought (I think) freely, without the least Prospect of Gain, do an honest and real Service to the Publick, 9 without considering my dear self; 10 what Hurt from Persons in great Posts, from Gentlemen with great Pensions, or how the Courtiers and prime Ministers may happen to relish it I value not; I am very little sollicitous whom I please or displease; I do my Duty;—'tis sufficient, 11 I say, that I do Good to my Fellow Subjects. But, before I open my Budget 12 of secret Knowledge, I was willing, Sir, to know your Opinion, and to take your Advice, and I beg you would let me know what may happen on my divulging these Secrets; if you think a Mulct or Fine may be laid of 100 l. or a Year's Imprisonment in the County-Jail, or that I must find Security for the Rest of my Life; I shall e'en keep my boasted Knowledge to myself, and bewail Mankind the Loss of this very useful Knowledge. But, to satisfy you, Sir, of the Truth of what I write, I shall only relate one Matter of Fact, that I am ready to prove by many living Evidences of unquestionable Authority, and leave you, Sir, to judge if I am an ignorant Pretender. Some Years ago, in my Way to Buckingham-House , as I was passing through the Mall , a Buzz flew about 13 that Sir —— was coming in a Chariot; —immediately all was in Disorder, and every Body prepared to throw themselves in a Posture of Worship and Adoration; 14 —for my Part, I had soon my Eye in the Chariot, and when, at the Distance of twenty Yards, I perceiv'd a huge, 15 unweildy, lazy 16 Fellow, lolling 17 and grinning 18 at his Ease; at first I supposed him to be, at least, the Keeper of the Lions, 19 and could not easily conceive why my Fellow-Creatures should cringe in that abject 20 Manner to the Man-brute 21 that took no Notice of the kind and abject Salutations that were paid to him. But as I presently recollected that my honest Countrymen were famous in History for Gratitude, so I supposed their present Respects were paid for the Care he might have of the young Whelps in the Tower, but not being certain who the mounted Grinner might be, I thought I was not bound to pay my Respects; but I immediately fell to consider his Physiognomy, secundum Artem , 22 and found Pride, a great Assurance, much Arrogance, and immense Quantity of Self-Love, no small Share of Avarice, with its Attendant Ambition, 112302 writ in his Face, 24 and to tell you the Truth, I saw some Signs of a violent Death there, and, if my Art does not deceive me, it will be a dry Death too; 25 I think he is in Danger of going up Stairs out of the World; 26 for which Reason I did not even move my Hat. 27 The Chariot had hardly passed, when a most impudent Coxcomb 28 accosted me with a Damme, 29 Sir, what do you mean?—What! is your nasty 30 Hat tied so fast to your Noddle, 31 that even the great Knight could not move it? A'n't you a Papist, 32 a Jesuite in Disguise, a disaffected Rascal hired by the Imperialists, one of those that made a Clamour about Dunkirk ? Really, I was not a little disordered at this Salutation, but immediately applying my self to my Art, I found young Pert had married the Grinner's Cook-Maid's first Cousin by the Mother's Side; 33 I found he had a Place of 700 l. a Year in the ——, and accordingly I told him, whatever his Pretensions were, he had receiv'd as much as he had deserved, I assured him; and, tho' he could handsomely 34 bully 35 in the Mall , yet he was a very contented C——d 36 at home; he suspected me for a Conjurer, 37 and retired with Precipitation. Thus my Art disengaged me from a Quarrel, and if you, Sir, approve this Art and Science, insert this in your next, and you will soon hear further from Sir, your very humble Servant , Tho. Squint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. On Hunters and Politicians (October 1730) On 10 October, just three weeks after The Craftsman had handsomely "puffed" Fielding's Modern Husband , there appeared in the same paper an "Essay upon Hunting" contributed, it would seem, by a Norfolk neighbor of Sir Robert Walpole who signed himself "Harry Hunter." This witty author, well skilled himself in the whole art of "Venation" and well read in the ancient and modern authors who have written of it, is chiefly concerned to explore the relationship he has discerned between hunters and politicians, and to share with us in particular "the Analogy between Politicks and Foxhunting ." Internal evidence once again strongly suggests that the real author of this clever satire is not "Harry Hunter" of Norfolk, but "Harry" Fielding, who did his hunting in Dorset and Hampshire. That Fielding was himself a sportsman is entirely likely, if we may judge not only from the space he gives in his comedies and novels to hunters and hunting, but also from his expert understanding of the sport and his knowledge of huntsmen's argot. In his plays—besides a number of characters whose conversation reveals that they are well acquainted with hunting, such as Malvil in Love in Several Masques (VIII. 18), Sir Harry Wilding in The Temple Beau (VIII. 154), Parson Puzzletext in The Grub-Street Opera (IX. 219), Lovemore in The Lottery (VIII. 274-275), and Mr. Woodall, the foxhunting M.P. in The Modern Husband —Fielding introduces several others who could be said to exist solely for the purpose of coursing through the countryside in avid pursuit of hares and foxes: there is Squire Foxchase in An Old Man Taught Wisdom , his near relation (no doubt) Sir Harry Fox-Chase in Pasquin , Sir Gregory Kennel in The Fathers , and most particularly Squire Badger and his huntsman Scut in Don Quixote in England . Such figures also inhabit the novels, of course: in Joseph Andrews , the hero himself serves a turn as "whipper-in" to Sir Thomas Booby's huntsman (I. 28-29), two young country gentlemen dispute the merits of their pointers (87-89), and an entire chapter relates "the hunting adventure" (Bk. III, ch. vi); in Tom Jones , as no one needs reminding, Western remains unmatched as a comic celebration of the English hunting squire. As with the two earlier essays on the therapeutic effects of laughter and the virtues of physiognomy, it might be said, then, that among popular authors of the period Fielding made this subject distinctively his own. The case for his authorship of the present essay is greatly strengthened, furthermore, when we consider the number of particular correspondences relating ideas and phrases, images and patterns of thought, in the present essay to passages in Fielding's acknowledged works. To be sure, there is nothing especially remarkable in the fact that both "Harry Hunter" and Fielding have read the same standard authors: Ovid in the Metamorphoses and Dryden's translation of him; Pope in Windsor Forest and Addison in The Freeholder . Others besides Fielding might also have noticed the same ludicrous or reprehensible practices of English hunters—their stocking the country with foxes, their pursuing the game over cornfields to the ruin of farmers, their beating down gates and recklessly leaping over hedges and ditches, their inhumane way of ignoring their unhorsed comrades. Others, no doubt (though surely not many!), enjoyed the "noble" sound of a pack of hounds in full cry, and admired the skill of the huntsman who commanded his dogs by mere modulations of his voice. The jargon of hunting would also be known to any keen sportsman. These things are commonplace and unremarkable, and taken individually would signify little. That "Harry Hunter" and Fielding should have them all in common, however—that they should so closely resemble each other in what they read and know and think about hunting—is impressive. Several other, more distinctive parallels strengthen that resemblance into almost certain identity. To begin with, it is hard to imagine any other author of the time who both loved hunting as Fielding loved it, and was also capable of elaborating at such length and so wittily a satiric comparison between hunters and politicians. Once in The Champion (29 July 1740) he in fact repeats the joke in the present essay comparing Walpole's creatures to hounds that are "perfectly stanch , and intirely at his Command "; and in a leader in that periodical (15 December 1739) he varies the general scheme of the essay only slightly, this time finding an analogy with politics in "the art of fishing." Throughout these early years, moreover, one of Fielding's favorite themes—heard most notably in "Of True Greatness" and Jonathan Wild —is the cruelty and inhumanity of those "great men" who, as "Harry Hunter" expresses it, "support their Grandeur by the Misery and Destruction of their Fellow-Creatures." In the present passage this theme is illustrated particularly by Nimrod, hunter of men, to whom Fielding later alludes in characterizing the malevolent squire of "the hunting adventure" in Joseph Andrews (I. 269). Indeed, that chapter from his first novel connects with the present essay in other ways as well. "Harry Hunter," for example, greatly admires the passage in the story of Actæon in which Ovid gives us "the Names of the whole Pack , which was very large, and make almost as noble a Sound in Verse as They once did in the Woods "; in Joseph Andrews (I. 271-272) Fielding actually parodies this very passage from the Metamorphoses . In the same chapter, again like "Harry Hunter," he enlarges the species "Dogs" to include "both human and canine ": the followers of the hunting squire in Joseph Andrews are said to be "dogs of his own species . . . . two or three couple of human or rather two-legged curs on horseback . . ." (I. 269-270). Finally, the essay bears certain marks of Fielding's style. Here, for example, as in the earlier essay on laughing, we find his favorite expression for villainy, "doing Mischief"; and as in the essay on physiognomy we find variations on his favorite compound denoting the community or brotherhood of men, "Fellow-Creatures" and "Fellow-Subjects." The word "Catastrophe" in its technical sense is also here, which surely cannot have been used as often as Fielding uses it by any other author of the period. Several of Fielding's favorite phrases are evident: the notion that reckless people risk "breaking their necks," that extraordinary qualities "shine forth," that the writer has so many examples to adduce "it would be endless to enumerate all" of them, that the victims of violence are "knocked on the head"—in the present context, indeed, the phrase "to knock an Hare on the Head in her Form" recurs almost verbatim in Tom Jones . In short, the number and distinctiveness of these correspondences, both in content and verbal texture, make it highly probable that Fielding was the author of this witty satire. To CALEB D'ANVERS, Esq ; SIR , You have already publish'd two or three Letters in Favour of Dogs, both human and canine ; 1 from whence some witty Gentlemen have taken Occasion to call you the Political Cynick . 2 I flatter myself therefore that an Essay upon Hunting will find a Place in your Paper. This Sport, which is of various Kinds, hath been in high Vogue amongst Princes and great Men from the earliest Accounts of Time. We read in Scripture of two great Hunters, Nimrod and Esau ; the former of whom is said to have been a mighty Hunter before the Lord , and the Commentators inform us that Mankind was his Prey ; 3 which is the most glorious Species of this Diversion, and hath therefore found a Multitude of Followers. All Tyrannical Princes, Invaders and Conquerors , who support their Grandeur by the Misery and Destruction of their Fellow-Creatures, 4 fall under this Denomination of Man-Hunters ; and the voracious Ministers of their Ambition may be properly call'd Blood-hounds . Several of our English Kings have been Huntsmen of this Kind; particularly William the Conqueror , whom Mr. Pope compares with Nimrod , in the following Verses of Windsor Forest . 5 Proud Nimrod first the bloody Chace began, A mighty Hunter, and his Prey was Man; Our haughty Norman boasts that barbarous Name, And makes his trembling Slaves the Royal Game . Esau is said to be a cunning Hunter ; and yet He was not able to support Himself by what He caught; for coming Home, one Day, weary and hungry from his Sport, He was oblig'd to sell his Birthright to his younger Brother for a Mess of Porridge . The antient Histories of Greece and Rome furnish us with several Instances of illustrious Huntsmen ; especially Meleager and Actœon ; whose Atchievements and unhappy Fate are beautifully described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses . 6 Meleager seems to have been a Sportsman of the Patriot-Kind , by delivering his Country from a monstrous, wild Boar , who committed terrible Ravages upon the People. Mr. Dryden calls this Beast , in his Translation, 7 a Minister of Vengeance , sent by Diana , to punish the Sins of the Nation. Actœon 8 was likewise a very celebrated Huntsman ; but We don't find that He ever consulted the Good of the Publick in his Diversions. He seems to be one, who hunted purely for the Sake of the Sport , and took Delight in the Company of his Dogs . 9 Ovid hath given us the Names of the whole Pack , 10 which was very large, and make almost as noble a Sound in Verse 11 as They once did in the Woods . 12 But what deserves our particular Notice is the Catastrophe 13 of this unfortunate Sportsman ; who being at length turn'd into a Stag , the Creature which he us'd to hunt, was pursued, run down and devoured by his own Hounds . The Moral of this Fable, according to some Commentators, is to expose Those, who spend their Estates or squander away great Sums of Money upon Dogs and Horses ; but I think it may be more properly apply'd to a wicked and cruel Statesman , who having pack'd together a Number of Men, in order to oppress and ruin his Fellow-Subjects, is often destroy'd by Them Himself, when They grow hungry for Want of other Prey . It is in vain for Him, at such a Time, to cry out, like Actœon, I am your Master . The Dogs , inur'd to Blood and Destruction, will pretend not to know Him from their usual Game, 14 and devour Him with as much Fury and as little Remorse, as He had taught them to devour others. It would be endless to enumerate 15 all the great Huntsmen of Antiquity . Nay, it would be useless to our present Purpose; since the Royal Diversion, of which I am speaking, continues in as high a Degree of Esteem with our modern Princes and great Men , as it did with Those of former Times . Most of the Courts of Europe have been engaged in it, during the whole Summer; and We have met with little else, in our Newspapers, but Hunting Matches 16 and Preparations for War ; as if the contending Parties were resolv'd to begin Hostilities, on both Sides, by the Destruction of wild Beasts , 17 in order to prepare their Hands for more glorious Slaughter. It is remarkable that Kings and other Hunters of Royal Dignity generally chuse Bulls, Bears, Boars or Stags for the Objects of their Sport; and I could almost undertake to distinguish the Characters of the most considerable Princes of Europe by the Quarry They pursue; but This would be too invidious a Task for a private Man; and might, perhaps, induce some of the foreign Ministers to make a Complaint against me, as an allegorical Defamer of the Kings, their Masters . The Subject of Bull-and-Bear-hunting 18 is, particularly, of too tender a Nature to admit of any Examination. The crafty, designing Politician seems to take most Delight in the Chace of a Fox ; 19 not with an Intent to kill the Creature, (for He is good for nothing when He is dead; and, besides, it would be unnatural for one, mischievous Animal to destroy another ) but only because a Fox-chace bears the nearest Resemblance to a Wild-Goose-Chace , 20 (of which some Statesmen are extremely fond) and gives Him the best Opportunity of displaying his Courage and Conduct ; for We shall find, upon Examination, that there is often a very great Analogy between Politicks and Foxhunting , as will appear by a short View of the Qualifications, requisite to the latter —A Foxhunter ought always to be well mounted , and to have, what the Sportsmen call, a good Seat in his Saddle. His Dogs must be perfectly stanch , 21 and intirely at his Command , so as to know every Sound of his Voice , 22 and obey the least Crack of his Whip . A true-bred-Foxhunter will not scruple to ride over Corn Fields , 23 beat down Gates , 24 or commit any other Spoil, in the Pursuit of his Sport; and if the wily Vermin 25 gives him good Diversion, He scorns to make the poor Farmer any Amends for all the Mischief He hath done Him, by inflicting Justice upon Reynard ; 26 if He cannot save Him from the Rage of the Dogs , He will be sure to stock the Country with two or three in his Stead. 27 Lastly, a keen Sportsman , of this Kind, is often oblig'd to gallop blindfold over Hedges and Ditches, 28 without any Regard to his Neck , 29 and is seldom pitied , 30 if He happens to break it —I hope there is no Need of any Application . I wonder that so cautious a Writer as Mr. Addison should venture to treat this illustrious Order of Men with so much Contempt as He hath done in his Freeholders ; 31 or that a Gentleman of his Candour would suffer the Violence of Party Prejudices to carry Him away so far as to represent the Character of a Fox-hunter incompatible with That of a Politician ; and yet this seems to be his favourite Topick of Ridicule through the whole Course of those Papers ; in one of which He tells us, "that for the Honour of his Majesty, and the Safety of his Government, we cannot but observe, that those who have appeared the greatest Enemies to both, are of that Rank of Men, who are commonly distinguish'd by the Title of Foxhunters . As several of these, says he, have had no Part of their Education in Cities, Camps , or Courts , it is doubtful whether they are of greater Ornament or Use to the Nation in which they live. It would be an ever-lasting Reproach to Politicks, should such Men be able to overturn an Establishment , which has been form'd by the wisest Laws , and is supported by the ablest Heads . The wrong Notions and Prejudices, which cleave to many of these Country Gentlemen , who have always lived out of the Way of being better inform'd, are not easy to be conceived by a Person, who has never conversed with them." I am always concerned, when I find my self obliged to differ in Opinion from so great a Writer; 32 but Truth ought to prevail over all other Considerations; and I thought it incumbent upon me, 33 when I was upon this Subject, to take some Notice of a Proposition, which Experience hath prov'd to be very ill-grounded. I am sensible that Mr. Addison was drawn into this Error by the Circumstances of the Times , in which he wrote, and which might partly justify his Assertion; but you know, Mr. D'Anvers , that We should never draw general Conclusions from particular Cases ; and I am very confident that if He were now alive, He would make no Scruple to retract so injurious a Reflection on the whole Body of British Sportsmen , 34 whom He hath stigmatiz'd with the Character of being Enemies to the present Government , and freely acknowledge that a Foxhunting-Politician is not so ridiculous a Composition as He formerly represented it. I need not produce any particular Instances of This. The Reader will immediately fix his Eye upon one Man 35 in whom these Qualities are happily united and shine forth 36 together with distinguished Lustre. 37 You cannot forget, Sir, that a little Piece was publish'd, about two Years ago, intitled the Norfolk Congress; in which the Doctrine of Political Cynegeticks was fully discuss'd, and their Advantages to the Nation demonstrated to the meanest Capacity. It is remarkable that the two great Points , which came under the Deliberation of that august Assembly , were the Suppression of a Dramatical Libel upon Corruption , 38 and the Destruction of an old vixon [sic] Fox , who had done the Country a great deal of Mischief; the first of which they dispatch'd without the least Difficulty or Opposition; but it must be confess'd that they were not altogether so successful in their Negociations upon the latter . The Fox , it seems, had more Cunning or better Luck than the Poet , and defeated all their Attempts against Her. She play'd a thousand Tricks to do this; but her last Stratagem was the subtlest of all. Having led them many a weary Chace, 39 and fearing nothing but being betray'd (of which she thought herself in some Danger) she resolv'd to betray first ; and immediately joining the Pack , which pursued her, diverted their Scent to another Fox , who happen'd to cross them at that Time and will probably give them more Trouble than Herself . I could give several other Instances of the Analogy between Politicks and Foxhunting . I could even prove, to Demonstration, that it is absolutely impossible for any Person to make an able Statesman , who is not a good Sportsman ; and that the Life of a Minister is, properly speaking, a Scene of Venation ; fill'd up with Toils, Dangers, Violence and Fraud ; but That would carry me too far beyond the Bounds, which I prescrib'd myself in this Essay upon Hunting . You have already prov'd that a Messenger of State is only another Word for a Political Courser , who is kept on Purpose to catch Game for his Master ; and I cannot help looking upon the present Race of Pensionary Writers , who plead for Violence and arbitrary Power , as a sort of scandalous Poachers , who hunt for the Spit , and never scruple to knock an Hare on the Head in her Form , 40 or shoot her upon the File ; a Practice, which hath always been detested by fair and generous Sportsmen . I am, SIR, Your constant Reader, Norfolk , Oct. 1. and humble Servant , 1730. Harry Hunter.</field>

Goldgar, Walpole and the Wits: The Relation of Politics to Literature, 1722-1742 (1976), pp. 102-105. 4 See Fielding's Miscellanies, Volume One , ed. H. K. Miller (1972), pp. 56-58. 5 Ralph wrote the Prologue for Fielding's Temple Beau (January 1730), and as Helen Sard Hughes suggested ( MP , 20 [1922-3], 19-34), Fielding may have found the idea for Tom Thumb in Ralph's The Touchstone (1728). On Fielding's friendship with Theobald, see C. B. Woods, PQ , 28 (1949), 419-424, as well as the compliment to him in Fielding's unpublished verse "Epistle to Mr. Lyttleton" (1733), lines 124-31 (Grundy, p. 244). Fielding's biographers have never adequately treated his friendship with Cooke, who, during the period 1729-32, was the author, successively, of three ministerial periodicals: viz . the London Journal , the British Journal , and The Comedian . 6 See the Daily Post (28 June 1731). 7 The Grub-Street Opera , ed. E. V. Roberts (1969), p. 79. 8 To the violent episodes in which Fielding became embroiled in the autumn of 1725 in Lyme Regis may now be added another occurring in London a year later, in which an acquaintance from Upton Grey accused Fielding of assaulting him on 4 November in St. James's parish (PRO: K.B.10.19. Pt. I, Michaelmas 13 George I). 9 Thus, when Wild and Mrs. Heartfree set out for Holland from London, they proceed via Harwich to Rotterdam ( Jonathan Wild , II. ix-x). 10 Walpole set out for Houghton from London on Friday, 28 June; he returned to Town on Tuesday morning, 16 July, and went directly to Hampton Court (see the Daily Journal , 1, 17 July 1728). 11 Fielding's name does not appear in the surviving court records of Harwich, Norwich, and King's Lynn for 1728-1729; however, these records are incomplete and of course some other town may be meant. 12 The Craftsman (19 September 1730) announced, somewhat prematurely as it turned out, that "the Town will shortly be diverted by a Comedy of Mr. Fielding 's, call'd, The Modern Husband, which is said to bear a great Reputation." 13 A correspondent in The Craftsman (15 March 1728/9) developed at length what would become a standard figure for Walpole: "the LEVIATHAN . . . this prodigious MAN-FISH ." 14 See W. L. Cross, The History of Henry Fielding (1918), I. 118-119. 15 See M. C. and R. R. Battestin, "A Fielding Discovery, with Some Remarks on the Canon," Studies in Bibliography , 33 (1980), 135. 1 Horace Walpole describes the lantern in Ædes Walpolianœ: or, A Description of the Collection of Pictures at Houghton-Hall in Norfolk , 2nd ed. (1752), p. 73. In 1749 Lord Chesterfield acquired the lantern for the hall of his newly built townhouse in Mayfair (see General Advertiser , 3 November 1749). It is frequently mentioned in accounts of Chesterfield House: see Athenœum (28 August 1869), p. 273; H. B. Wheatley and P. Cunningham, London Past and Present (1891), I. 388; W. H. Craig, Life of Lord Chesterfield (1907), p. 277, n. 1. 2 From Horace Walpole's annotated copy of Chesterfield's Miscellaneous Works , eds. M. Maty and J. D. Justamond (1777), I. 30 (second series): in the British Library. See also Ædes Waipolianœ (loc. cit.) where he refers specifically to "the Craftsman , which made so much Noise about this Lantern at Houghton ." 3 An Author to be Lett , ed. J. R. Sutherland, Augustan Reprint Society, No. 84 (1960), p. 7. 4 See the mock-letter "to the Author of the Daily Gazetteer ," signed "H. B.," in Newcomb's Miscellaneous Collection of Original Poems . . . Written chiefly on Political and Moral Subjects (1740), p. 359. 5 Craig, p. 277, n. 1; Rudé, Hanoverian London, 1714-1808 (1971), p. 44. In a letter of 23 August 1975 Professor Rudé was kind enough to assure me that Wheatley was his source. 6 No such gloss occurs in any of the copies of Ædes Walpolianœ recorded in Allen T. Hazen's Catalogue of Horace Walpole's Library (1969). Indeed, Walpole himself apparently suspected Chesterfield of having originated the joke. In a copy of the first edition (1747) now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he wrote: "This lantern is now taken away, and a french lustre, bought at Ld Cholmondeley's sale, placed in it's room, by the Second Lord Orford, who has lately sold the celebrated Lantern to Philip, Earl of Chesterfield, one of the great opponents of Sir R.W. &amp; no unlikely Author of the Legends of the Lantern." For this information I am indebted to Mr. R. W. Lightbown, Keeper of the Library, the V&amp;A Museum. For their help in checking other annotated copies of this work, I wish to thank Mrs. Catherine Jestin, Mrs. Edwine M. Martz, and Dr. Charles Ryskamp. 7 Alluding, apparently, to a pious leader in the London Journal (6 July 1728) on the inner light of conscience in men. 1 The meaning of the Latin epigraph is explained as follows in CS (26 February 1737): "The Romans us'd to say, ex Pede Herculem , or, you may know Hercules by his Foot, intimating, that one may commonly judge of the Whole by a Part." For Fielding's ironic association of Walpole with Hercules, see Ch (8 May 1740): "I own there is something very ridiculous in the image of several millions of people complaining bitterly against the insults and oppression of one man. What an idea must we conceive of this man, but that he is another Hercules . . .!" 2 On the possibility that Fielding, on returning from Holland for the summer, might have visited Walpole in Norfolk, see above, p. 74. 4 Cf. PRS , referring to the "Chrysipus": "I intend here only to set down some of its chief qualities; for to enumerate all, would require a large volume" (XV. 73). Also Ch (8 December 1739), referring to Hercules' club: "I have here given only a Specimen of the Adventures of this heroic Wood; the whole are compriz'd in a large Folio . . . ." *4 Besides the more exact parallels to this unusual phrase quoted in the introduction (p. 82), cf. also the following: "strikes a very great awe into the eyes of the beholders" ( Ch , 20 March 1739/40); "your shining qualities . . . never reach the eyes of" ( JW , II. 15), "a considerable sum glittering in their eyes" (II. 40). 1 The essay originally carried the following introduction by Nathaniel Mist: The long Vacation among the busy World is called the dull Time of the Year; it is therefore incumbent upon us Writers (whose Province it is to entertain the Publick) as [ sic ] such Seasons, to present them with something that may be good for the Vapours, a Distemper arising from cloudy Weather, or an unactive Life, or too much Money; to which Purpose I shall now publish a learned Essay, which comes from a Correspondent upon the Benefit of laughing . I remember a French Comedy, in which Harlequin is introduced as a Philosopher disputing with another of the same Character concerning Man , whom he defines thus, L'Homme est une Animal risible . Thus he does not imagine Man to be a rational , but a laughing Animal , and it will be allowed, that Laughter is the only Thing which distinguishes some Men from Beasts, and this is sufficient to shew the Subject not unworthy our serious Consideration. 2 The physicians in TT (p. 35), mistaking a monkey for Thumb, give him a drug that poisons him. "Nauseous" is one of F's favorite words. Applied to drugs it occurs in LSM (VIII. 64), FCW (XII. 269), JSS (XII. 319), CGT (X. 129), RALF (XVI. 106), KCM (XIV. 298), Ch (27 March 1740), JWN (II. 238, 304), TJ (III. 192). * Cf. "the various laughs, titters, tehes, &amp;c., of the fair sex" ( KCM , XIV. 288). Also the laughs of Lady Charlotte and Mrs. Modern in MH (X. 39, 67) and Miss Lucy in Town: "And te, he, he, / And te, he, he! / At nothing as loud as a jest" (XII. 39). 4 On the "Sneer" see KCM (XIV. 288), Ch (13 Dec. 1739, 3 Jan., 12 Feb. 1739/40, 25 Mar., 10 June, 19 Aug. 1740), JA (I. 130, 183, 232, 246, 311), TJ (III. 365). 5 One of the milder examples of F's "low" comedy: cf. "carry off the wine and the p-ss of a great man together" ( Co , XIV. 274); "a long piss-burnt beard" ( JA , I. 305), or the scene in which Joseph douses the captain and Adams with the contents of a chamberpot (I. 292). *6 Cf. a "smile, and a strong contraction of the muscles" ( KCM , XIV. 289); "as he had that perfect mastery of . . . his muscles . . . he soon conveyed a smile into his countenance" ( JW , II. 63); "we are taught . . . the countenance miserable . . . before the muscles are grown too stubborn" ( JWN , II. 293); and several instances in JA : comedy "doth not . . . so strongly affect and agitate the muscles" as burlesque (I. 20); "he had a perfect command of his muscles, and could laugh inwardly without . . . symptoms in his countenance" (I. 282); the comical appearance of Adams "disordered the composed gravity of [Pounce's] muscles" (I. 305). 7 One source of comedy in F's theory of humor, as in KCM (XIV. 287): "suppose a person well-drest should tumble in a dirty place in the street; I am afraid there are few who would not laugh at the accident." Cf. also the beau Jack Stocks laughing at the country squire Lovemore: "Ha, ha, ha . . . squire Noodle, faith, you make a very odd sort of a ridiculous figure—Ha, ha!" ( L , VIII. 284); and JA , where Joseph and Fanny "would scarce have refrained laughing to see the parson rolling down the hill" (I. 220) and where Adams's tumbling off his horse affords "infinite merriment to the servants" (I. 389). The phrase itself is common in F's works, as in Ch : "we often see a blundering fellow" (6 Dec. 1739), "one of the most . . . blundering Fellows" (17 June 1740). 8 Swift was always one of F's favorite wits. Earlier in 1728 he published Ma under the pseudonym, "Lemuel Gulliver, Poet Laureat to the King of Lilliput" and in LSM he has Lord Formal praise "that divine collection of polite learning written by Mr. Gulliver" (VIII. 55). In JA Fielding invokes as his own Muse, "thou who didst infuse such wonderful humor into the pen of immortal Gulliver" (I. 270). *9 A frequent witticism in F's writings: e.g. "it is admitted to be the general Presumption, that no Physician ever takes his own Physick" ( CJ , p. 20); when the College of Physicians own the sway of Common Sense, "May we be forced to take our own prescriptions" ( P , XI. 210); "a quack doctor . . . who trumpets over the virtues of his pills . . . and begs to be excused from taking any of them himself" ( Ch , 19 Apr. 1740); and in RALF F declares that his "prescriptions . . . have this uncommon recommendation, that I have tried them upon myself with some success" (XVI. 100). Also Dulness in D (p. 227): "Which of my Doctors would with Safety kill / Should he not only write but taste his Bill." *10 F so much admired this character that in TrT he invented his own version of her, "Glumdalca, of the Giants." 11 For the use of this term for the Whigs, see Ch (8 Dec. 1739), JW (II. 74), TJ (III. 329). 12 Cf. JA (I. 96): " 'the clergy would be certain to cry down" Adams's sermons. " 'God forbid . . . any books should be propagated which the clergy would cry down.' " See also below, n. 42. 13 Cf. MD (X. 163): "His wife is sick, Doctor; and he has brought you a guinea for your advice." 14 F often celebrates the jollifying power of wine: e.g. Ma (lines 347-8), TB (VIII. 114), LW (IX. 170-171), GSO (IX. 214), JW (II. 194). See esp. Sotmore in RR (IX. 86-87), who with a friend in a tavern raises "good humour" over a "pint" of wine; and "H. Bottle" in Ch (20 May 1740), who recommends "the jolly Delight of an honest Fellow over a Bottle." *15 F often expressed his admiration for Butler's "inimitable Hudibras" ( Ch , 27 Nov. 1739; also 1 Apr. 1740; EH , XI. 302; TJ , III. 171). Earlier in 1728 he had in a sense anticipated this association between Butler and Swift: see Ma , a poem in hudibrastics by "Lemuel Gulliver", esp. lines 21-28, 53-54. *16 The use of proverbs is a distinctive feature of F's humor. With the present passage compare especially TrT (IX. 54-55, n. 98): "I am not so well pleased with any written remains of the ancients, as with those little aphorisms which verbal tradition hath delivered down to us, under the title of Proverbs . . . My Lord Bacon is of opinion that whatever is known of arts and sciences might be proved to have lurked in the Proverbs of Solomon. . . . a more perfect system of ethics, as well as economy, might be compiled out of them, than is at present extant." In DQE Sancho is given whole speeches comprised entirely of proverbs (e.g. I. vi, II. vi, III, vi). See also Ch (28 Feb. 1739/40, 7 June 1740); in a later issue (28 Aug. 1740) F adds to the present list of proverbs on laughter by quoting "this Proverb, Let him laugh that wins ." *17 Cf. MD (X. 162), where the physicians attending Davy's wife disagree in their diagnoses: "one says 'tis the dropsy; another 'tis the what-d'ye-call it, the tumpany." 18 Cf. JA (I. 92): "that sanative soporiferous draught, a medicine"; also Ch. (27 Mar. 1740): " Haustipotiferous Draught ." 19 Cf.. Ch (13 Sept. 1740), referring to Tories and Whigs: "These Creatures are exceeding noxious." 20 Cf. Ch (20 Mar. 1739/40): "a disdainful sneer." 21 Cf. KCM (XIV. 285-286): "that glavering sneering smile . . . a compound of malice and fraud . . . . that glavering smile, whose principal ingredient is malice." Also AF (VIII. 194): "As ye are done by, ye malicious, do; / And kindly laugh at him, who laughs at you"; TB (VIII. 106) "that malicious smile"; JA (I. 311) "a malicious sneer"; TJ (III. 365) "one of her malicious sneers." 22 Presumably a play on the sexual meaning of to die. Cf. TT (p. 31), where Cleora implores Cupid on behalf of the "Love-sick Maid": "When One you wound, you then destroy; / When Both you kill, you kill with Joy." 23 Cf. KCM (XIV. 287): "that honest, hearty, loud chuckle, which shakes the sides of aldermen and squires, without the least provocation of a jest; proceeding chiefly from a full belly." In TB (VIII. 107) Lady Lucy Pedant's laugh reveals her "very fine teeth." Cf. JSS (XII. 325): "Her . . . teeth blacken." *24 Cf. Job Vinegar writing in Ch (4 Sept. 1740) of the education of women: they are "but half taught to read and write . . . . The Women write Letters from one to another, which they call Scrolls, or, according to others, Scrols, Scroles, Scrawls, Scrauls, Skrawls, Skrauls, Scrales, Sqrals, Ksrals, (for they are all the same Word, differently spelt)"; F makes the same point in the same way in JWN (II. 211). Several of his female characters write letters that are comically misspelled: e.g. Shamela (Letter I) and her mother (Letter VIII), and Mrs. Honour ( TJ , V. 189-190). 25 F's ignorant characters often commit such ribald blunders when they attempt to express themselves in writing: e.g. Jonathan Wild's "adwhorable" (II. 115) and in JA (I. 328) Justice Frolick's "cumfarting." 26 Women who suffer from the vapors are plentiful in F's plays: e.g. LSM (VIII. 42, 46, 47), TB (VIII. 157), RR (IX, 100), GSO (IX. 268), UG (XI. 83, 100), E (XI. 284), MLT (XII. 55, 62). In JWN (II. 230) this malady, personified, is said to be the patron of physicians. 27 One of F's favorite epithets: e.g. RR (IX. 125) "handsome reward"; LW (IX. 176) "handsome booty"; Mi (X. 215) "a good handsome soup"; UG (XI. 126) "not acting the handsomest part by me"; JA (I. 91) "introduce something handsome on him", etc. Also as an adverb (see below, "Physiognomist," n. 34): e.g. LSM (VIII. 77) "I shall be very handsomely disengaged"; DQE (XI. 29) "come down handsomely with the ready"; JA (I. 129) "if I knew how to be handsomely off with the other." *28 The maid's speech follows the usual formula in F, when he is representing female servants in dialogue with their mistresses: "Lord [ or La], Madam . . . your Ladyship . . . ." Thus Mrs. Honour in TJ (III. 191-192), who is also fond of the word "handsome": "La, ma'am, what doth your la'ship think? the girl . . . you thought so handsome . . . . I, ma'am! . . . I am sorry your ladyship should have such an opinion of me . . . . Because I said he was a handsome man? . . . I never thought as it was any harm to say a young man was handsome . . . handsome is that handsome does." Cf. also Catchit in LSM (VIII. 32, 34, 56-57); Betty in LW (IX. 194); Lately in MH (X, 13), Jenny in L (VIII. 276-277); Slipslop in JA (I. 44-45, 316, 325). 29 F often satirizes the ladies' passion for quadrille, the fashionable card game: e.g. LSM (VIII. 27, 42, 55), TB (VIII. 171), L (VIII. 277), MH (X. 14-15, 50), Mi (X. 184-185, 238), UG (XI. 82, 124). The game is among "The Pleasures of the Town" ridiculed in AF (1730 version, pp. 49-52), where Punch echoes the sentiment and phrasing of the present passage by advising, "That if you would avoid all ill, / You should leave off the dear quadrille" (emphasis added); in MH (X. 15) Mrs. Worthy "has left off play." 30 In UG (XI. 154) Capt. Spark and Sir Simon Raffler similarly consider which is the superior entertainment, "country dancing" or "quadrille." Country dances, always associated in his thoughts with fiddlers and innocent merriment, were a favorite amusement of F's. In TT (p. 32) the King remarks of Huncamunca, "A Country Dance of Joys is in your Face"; and in TJ (IV. 261) Mrs. Fitzpatrick speaks of the "gayety and mirth . . . in a country-dance." Cf. also LSM (VIII. 42). The fiddler in LW (IX. 178) is "obliged to play some country-dances"; indeed, a number of Fielding's plays end with fiddlers doing just this—e.g. GSO (revised version), CGT, HR (XI. 267), where Walpole as Quidam fiddles while his followers dance. A whole chapter of JWN (I. xv) is devoted to Julian's life as a fiddler; and in the Battle in the Churchyard in TJ (III. 172) F thus laments the vanquished Jemmy Tweedle, who "cheered the rural nymphs and swains, when upon the green they interweaved the sprightly dance, while he himself stood fiddling and jumping to his own music. How little now avails his fiddle!" 31 The folly of investing in stocks is a recurrent theme in F's writings of the period: e.g. LSM (VIII. 85), TB (VIII. 110; also 109, 132-133, 177), D (p. 222). See, too, IC (X. 305), DQE (XI. 37), and L , where Mr. Stocks and Jack Stocks are brothers. *32 Cf. Betty in JA (I. 101), who contemplates suicide when Joseph rejects her advances: "but whilst she was engaged in this meditation, happily death presented itself to her in so many shapes—of drowning, hanging, poisoning, etc.—that her distracted mind could resolve on none." As for the particular poison contemplated, cf. Pincet in TB (VIII. 173), who disguises herself as the lawyer, Counsellor Ratsbane. 33 F, too, seems to have found the antics of monkeys diverting; one was among his personal effects advertised for sale after his death ( Public Advertiser , 26 Dec. 1754). In LSM (VIII. 41) Lady Matchless hopes for a lover who will at least be "able to divert one in the sullenness of a monkey," and in TJ (V. 256) a young woman's pretending to learning is said to be "as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape." Eurydice in the play has a "favourite monkey" (XI. 284), and in TT (p. 35) a monkey dressed in Thumb's clothes is dosed to death by doctors. See also MH (X. 28), V (XV. 37), JA (I. 46), Co (XIV. 265). 34 Cf. DQE (XI. 27): "I have too great cause to try to divert my grief." 35 F's contempt for stock-jobbers is apparent from several passages: e.g. Ch (16 Feb. 1739/40): "estates which have been gotten by plunder, cheating, or extortion, which would include most . . . stockjobbers"; L (VIII. 291), an entire song satirizing the breed; MLT (XII. 60), where the Jew Zorobabel is called, a "low, pitiful, stock-jobbing pick-pocket." Cf. also AF (1730, p. 31), MH (X. 35), and P (XI. 224). 36 Cf. JWN (II. 272) "he burst into a loud laugh" and (II. 288) "I thought Minos would have burst his sides at it." Also AF (1730, p. 36), where Witmore imagines the audience laughing "till they burst." 37 In TJ (IX. 109) the robbers "cried out . . . that they were dead men," and (V. 244) Fitzpatrick, having been run through the body by Jones, declares, "I am a dead man." 38 Two adjectives which F often applies to characters with sullen, prim dispositions, as in Sourwit the critic in HR and Counsellor Starchum in TB (VIII. 173). Thus in Ch (5 Apr. 1740) charity is said to be "a stranger to all sourness . . . of mind"; JWN (II. 268) "I was of a sour, morose temper, and hated . . . the symptoms of happiness appearing in any countenance"; O (XIV. 325) "a sour complexion"; JA (I. 194) "one of the sourest-faced women"; (145) "discreet and starch carriage." *39 Cf. WD (XII. 88): "Millamour, was you ever in company with my Lord Grig?— He is the merriest dog—" 40 Cf. JA (I. 277): "some more jokes were (as they called it) cracked." * Here something is left out for Reasons of State . 41 Fielding found it amusing to refer to trades or arts or sciences as "Mysteries": e.g. Ma (lines 133-134); AF (1730, p. 32), GSO (IX. 225), Co (XIV. 269), N (XIV. 314), JWN (II. 293), etc. With the phrasing of the present passage, cf. JA (I. 103): "There are certain mysteries or secrets in all trades . . . which are seldom discovered." 42 See above, n. 12. 43 Cf. JW (II. 63): "he soon conveyed a smile into his countenance." 44 Hippocrates and Galen are invoked as the supreme medical authorities in many passages in F's works: e.g. Ch (25 Dec. 1739, 26 Aug. 1740), JA (I. 75), CJ (pp. 5-6), and TT (p. 33), where they are cited along with Paracelsus. See also, for Hippocrates: MD (X. 154), Ch (15 Nov. 1739); for Galen: DQE (XI. 48), PRS (XV. 66). 45 Cf. LSM (VIII. 18) "you . . . are . . . most an enemy to yourself"; P (XI. 192): "I am my own enemy." *46 F's quacks regularly prescribe these three remedies: the 1st Physician in TT (pp. 33-34) has "put on Four Blisters . . . a Purge, and a Vomit"; and in DQE (XI. 48) Dr. Drench orders "vomiting, purging, blistering" and later (68) predicts dire consequences if his patient "be not . . . blistered, vomited, purged, this instant." In OMTW (X. 348-9) Blister the apothecary similarly recommends "purging, and vomiting, and blistering." 47 Cf. JA , where Barnabas cites "the example of the primitive ages" of the clergy (I. 95), and Adams believes he's met "a Christian of the true primitive kind" (I. 200). Also JW (II. 183), where it is said that Mrs. Heartfree "might tempt a saint to abandon the ways of holiness." *48 Both Joseph Andrews (I. 81) and Tom Jones (IV. 72-74) find themselves in this predicament when they are committed to the care of doctors. 49 "Sweetness" is the quality Fielding associates with the "temper" and "countenance" of Fanny in JA (I. 176) and Sophia in TJ (III. 148, V. 208). Cf. also Mrs. Partridge in TJ (III. 70), whose "countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of temper." 50 A consistent theme of F's satire is the empty promises of great men and courtiers, particularly Walpole. In Ch (17 Jan. 1739/40), for example, the following are among the "unintelligible sounds" great men utter: "believe me, depend on me, I'll certainly serve you another time, this is promised"; and item 5 in "Nicodemus Bungle's" course of lectures on the art of prime-ministry is: "Promises of all Sorts and Sizes . . . nothing in them" (28 Feb. 1739/40). With the reference in the present passage to "the first Vacancy," compare Ch (14 Feb. 1739/40): "talk of vacancies, good things, snug places, &amp;c. . . . I have as great contempt for the promises of Mr. Forage [i.e. Walpole] as any man living can have"; and also the promising gentleman's assurance to the alehouse-keeper in JA (I. 207)—"I was certain of the first vacancy". Cf. also LW (IX. 162), DQE (XI. 34), P (the character of Col. Promise and passim ), KCM (XIV. 293), JW (II. 21), and EH (XI. 299), where Pillage [i.e. Walpole] gives assurances—"you shall be provided for in time. You must have patience . . . depend on me you shall have a part." 51 "Quidam" ("Somebody") is F's name for Walpole in HR. Cf. P (XI. 191), where the daughter of the Mayor says of the Daily Gazetteer , which Walpole distributed gratis throughout the country: "my papers are paid for too by somebody." 1 For an excellent brief discussion of Fielding's interest in this subject, see H. K. Miller, Essays on Fielding's 'Miscellanies': A Commentary on Volume One (1961), pp. 192-194. 2 Together with such similar compounds as "Fellow-Christians" and "Fellow Subjects" occurring later in the essay, F often uses the expression "Fellow-Creature(s)"—here as in the following essay on hunters and politicians from The Craftsman (see that text, n. 4). Among many instances, see the following: FC (line 10), JA (I. 195, 215, 264), JW (II. 204), JWN (II. 235), TJ (III. 25). Other variants include "Fellow-Citizens" ( Ch , 22 Nov. 1739; KCM , XIV. 282); "Fellow-Sufferers" ( TJ , V. 37); "Fellow-Soldiers" ( JWN , II. 305); "Fellow-Travellers" ( Ch. 27 Dec. 1739; JA , I. 108, 109, 167, 217, 284, 314; TJ , IV. 103, V. 293). 2 F often poses as one who has mastered the "Rules" of a particular science or art, as in Ch , where he lays down rules for critics (27 Nov. 1739), for angling and politics (15 Dec. 1739), for perfecting impudence (29 Jan. 1739/40), for subduing the passions (2 Feb. 1739/40). In the Preface to JA he sets down the rules for the comic-epic; in JW , those for "greatness"; in Co , those for good-breeding. With his insistence in the present paragraph that the science of physiognomy is governed by rules "certain" and "infallible," cf. KCM : "rules, the . . . infallibility of which" (XIV. 283); "infallible guide . . . greatest certainty . . . . so certain a method" (289); "more certain rule" (301). 3 For a discussion of F's satires of the Royal Society, see Miller, Essays , pp. 329ff. 4 Cf. Ch (15 July 1740), where Hercules Vinegar, recounting the history of lost arts and sciences, declares that "such as were obliged to converse with the Devil for their Knowledge, were named Conjurers"; his father, Nehemiah, has set up a political "conjuring Shop." *5 "Squint's" general pose and many of his phrases anticipate those of "Nicodemus Bungle" in Ch (28 Feb. 1739/40), who, after protesting that "the Mysteries of Politics . . . require neither the Talents of a Conjurer, nor so much Labour and Instruction to comprehend," declares that the "Art of Prime-Ministry" is a very different matter: "An Art which to those who are not versed in it, doth indeed seem to abound in Mysteries . . . . But as dark and difficult as this is, I have, with infinite Pain and Study, at last made myself a perfect Master of it, and intend to convert my Knowledge at once to the Use of my Country." Ch indeed contains numerous echoes of "Squint's" declaration: politics is said to be "a mystery . . . a secret not easy to be apprehended . . . reserved only for the adepts" (14 Feb. 1739/40); Walpole is represented as a quack who, because of his success, has been thought "a Conjurer . . . but indeed his Success is entirely owing to an Art which no Man was ever so great a Master of" (15 July 1740). The present paragraph contains two concepts which Fielding repeatedly uses: that of the adept in a science, and of a conjurer or conjuring . For the former, see Ch (15 Nov. 1739, 29 Jan., 14 Feb., 13 Mar. 1739/40, 15, 22 Apr. [where F corrects Cibber for misusing the word], 8 May, 12 June, 16 Aug. 1740) and JW (II. 89). References to conjurers : Ma (Dedication), LSM (VIII. 86), AF (1730, p. 49), RR (IX. 117), LW (IX. 174), TrT ("Merlin, a Conjurer"), L (VIII. 293), GSO (revised, p. 77), MH (X. 15), Mi (X. 205), HR (XI. 245). 6 Cf. P (XI. 222): "juggling tricks . . . done at Fawks's after a much better manner." 7 Cf. Ch : "brought to that height of purity" (22 Dec. 1739); "an height to which I myself have arrived" (25 Dec. 1739); "raise and elevate human nature to the highest pitch of goodness" (22 Jan. 1739/40); "bring them to this height of perfection" (29 Jan. 1739/40). Also JW (II. 204): "arrived at that degree of greatness." 8 The place of excise-men and custom-house officers in this list will be clear from P (XI. 183): "the customs and the excise afford a great number of places." Also Ch (15 May 1740): "Resolv'd, To prevent Corruption, that . . . no Wife of an Exciseman or Customhouse Officer shall be allowed any Vote." 9 Cf. the division of society in JW into two classes, "of those who employ hands for the use of the community in which they live, and of those who employ hands merely for their own use, without any regard to the benefit of society" (II. 47); or "Let us consider ourselves all as members of one community, to the public good of which we are to sacrifice our private views" (155). Also JWN (II. 244): "you will . . . sacrifice your own happiness to the public good." *10 Cf. Mrs. Honour in TJ (III. 359): "it is less wicked to hurt all the world than one's own dear self." 11 Cf. TrT (IX. 24): "When I'm not thanked at all, I'm thanked enough. / I've done my duty, and I've done no more." 12 Cf. Mi (X. 185): "I have a whole budget of news to tell you." F adopts this usage in his pseudonym "Mum Budget" ( CS , 13 May 1738). *13 Cf. JWN (II. 231), as the narrator arrives at the Presence Chamber in the Palace of Death: "a buzz ran through it, as in all assemblies, before the principal figure enters." 14 Cf. DAD (XVI. 79), where Alexander is said to receive the "worship . . . . [the] adoration of slaves." Also Mrs. Trulliber's attitude toward her husband in JA (I. 189): she "carried her adoration to an opinion of his infallibility . . . . and now worshipped her husband." 15 Cf. Ch (13 Dec. 1739), where this epithet is applied to Walpole no fewer than four times: "a huge over grown fellow . . . . the huge man," etc. 16 As with "lolling" and "grinning" to follow, F was fond enough of this adjective to use it as the name of two of his characters, "Lord Lazy" ( MH ) and "Doctor Lazy" ( MD , X. 148). Especially relevant in the present context are CGT (X. 114), where the chairman declares that those who ride instead of walk are "lazy rascals," and JW (II. 141, 150), where Wild is several times said to be "lazy" for employing others to rob for him. 17 Cf. S (pp. 333-334): "it doth not become me to loll in a chariot." "Lady Loller" figures in UG (XI. 137). *18 F, who later in this essay refers to Walpole twice more as the "Grinner," emphasizes this feature of the minister's countenance in Ch : "the art of grinning with a heavy heart is the very greatest qualification of a statesman" (15 Dec. 1739); lecturing on the art of prime-ministry, "Nicodemus Bungle" stresses the qualification of "A very particular broad Grin, the like never seen before" (28 Feb. 1739/40); "I never saw a pernicious Knave without a Grin upon his Face" (28 Aug. 1740). "Beau Grin" is a character in LSM (VIII. 25). 19 The lions kept at the Tower of London are referred to in several of F's plays: L (VIII. 291), MH (X. 45), MLT (XII. 37-38). It is tempting to see this reference as a compliment to F's good friend, the painter John Ellys, whom Walpole appointed Keeper of the Lions; but Elly's appointment appears to date from 1739. Cf. CGJ (29 Aug. 1752): "Mr. Ellis informs me that he never could discover any the least Indication of Contempt in the Lions under his Care." *20 F often uses these words, cringe and abject , to describe the behavior of sychophants: e.g. Co (XIV. 257), where he characterizes the wrong attitude toward one's superiors as "an abject and base servility . . . . cringes [that] fall little short of prostration." In JWN (II. 264) Julian thus recalls his life as a general: "A bow, a smile, a nod from me, as I passed through cringing crowds, were esteemed as signal favours"; and in Ch (2 Oct. 1740) the led captain is said to "fawn in a very abject and submissive Manner" on those who will feed him. In general, compare the behavior of Walpole and his followers in the present passage with that of the proud parson and his parishioners in JA (I. 198): "I often laugh when I behold him on Sundays strutting along the churchyard like a turkey-cock through rows of his parishioners, who bow to him with as much submission, and are as unregarded as a set of servile courtiers by the proudest prince in Christendom." 21 The term seems synonymous with "Leviathan," a name for Walpole among Opposition writers and used by Capt. Merit in MH (X. 21). Cf. similar compounds elsewhere in F: a "man-fool" ( WD , XII. 107); "the strange man-woman" ( P , XI. 179); "she-dog" ( JA , I. 98). 22 Cf. CJ (p. 6): "he was not committed thither secundum artem ." 23 Following Aristotle ( Politics , II. vi. 19) and Horace ( Satires , I. iv. 25-26), F regarded avarice and ambition as complementary passions exemplifying negative and positive excess. They are thus paired in many of his works: UG (XI. 153), S (p. 306), N (XIV. 317-318), DAD (XVI. 82), TJ (III. 286), CGJ (4 Nov. 1752). 24 Cf. TB (VIII. 148), where it is said that innocence is "writ" in Bellaria's "face." *25 F recalls the old axiom expressed by Capt. Bilkum in CGT (X. 115): "If born to hang, [I] never shall be drowned." The infant Tom Jones is said to have been discovered "in a box so full of rain-water, that he would certainly have been drowned, had he not been reserved for another fate" (IV. 94)—that fate being "that he was certainly born to be hanged" (III. 107). As Jonathan Wild contemplates drowning himself in the sea, F contrives an entire episode to dramatize this axiom, applying it again to a character who is meant to suggest Walpole (II. 90-93). Cf. also Punch and Joan's song in AF (1730, p. 43): "Would you were hanged or drowned in a ditch." *26 Hanging, F declares in JW (II. 199), is "the proper catastrophe of a great man" —a sentiment he expressed in many other places as well: e.g. RR (IX. 93), MH (X. 20), Ch (8 Jan. 1739/40). Most particularly, it was the appropriate fate for the Great Man, Sir Robert Walpole—whether he appears as Robin in GSO (IX. 221-222) or as Jonathan Wild. In JW (II. 197-201) F devotes an entire chapter to expounding this thesis—and in a manner that recalls the present passage in several ways: in the notion that "Fortune at his birth . . . ordained" Wild to hang; in the observation that a "good judge" (such as "Tom Squint") will see that the deeds of such a great man deserve this conclusion; in the ironic representation of hanging as an ascent, as Wild's "highest consummation," his "apotheosis," his "exalted end"; and in echoing the phrase "going upstairs out of the World " (emphasis added)—viz. "swung out of this world . . . . going this way out of the world." *27 In a note to his chapter "Of hats" in JW , F remarks "that custom, which hath descended through all nations, of showing respect by pulling off this covering, and that no man is esteemed fit to converse with his superiors with it on" (II. 74, n.). Thus in S (p. 318) Parson Williams complains that Booby "met my father without . . . pulling off his hat"; in JA (I. 198) a certain clergyman is so proud "he will not move his hat" to his parishioners (cf. F's phrase in the present passage); and Tom Jones (III. 123) is similarly "deficient in outward tokens of respect" to Thwackum, "often forgetting to pull off his hat." See also Ch (22 Nov. 1739), JA (I. 89), TJ (IV. 234). 28 In JA (I. 320) Lady Booby calls Lawyer Scout "an impudent coxcomb." 29 This oath is often uttered by F's bullies when affecting that "fierce aspect" which, he observes in KCM (XIV. 288), is "the symptom only of a bully": e.g. Bob Bagshot in JW (II. 27) and Wild himself (89-90, 197); Bellarmine and the man of courage in JA (I. 131-132, 152). 30 Another of F's favorite adjectives—applied, for example, to apothecaries ( OMTW , X. 338), Tories ( P , XI. 181), "creatures" ( S , p. 333, and JA , I. 325), eyes ( JA , I. 98), a name, and the hawk that killed Sophia's songbird ( TJ , III. 152, 295). 31 Cf. AF (1730, p. 16): "To see a fellow . . . toss up his empty noddle with a scornful disdain." 32 Cf. P (XI. 182), where the mayor's daughter, who favors the Court Party, parrots the ministerial charge that those in Opposition were Jacobites at heart and hence sympathetic to Roman Catholicism: "Yes, I hope I am a friend to my country; I am not for bringing in the pope." *33 Cf. Ch (19 Feb. 1739/40): "all men in power will naturally first provide for their own relations, yet . . . this preference should not extend itself to the most distant affinity by marriage of those relations; nay, even to their very menial dependants . . . conferring genteel places, those of profit and even of trust on the lowest servants, without any regard to birth, education, or capacity." 34 For F's fondness for this word, see above, "Laughing," n. 28. 35 "Bullies" are a favorite target of F's satire: e.g. KCM (XIV. 288), Ch (20 Nov. 1739, 13 Mar. 1739/40), JW (II. 28, 190), JWN (II. 264). With the present association of bullies and cuckolds, see esp. RR (IX. 88), where Ramble means "to lessen the number of bullies, and increase that of cuckolds." 369 Cuckolds and cuckolding are, of course, a recurrent subject of F's comedies. But the theme, as well as the phrase itself, of the "contented cuckold" is especially prominent in MH , which F was composing at about this same time. Besides the passage quoted in the introduction above (p. 76), the idea of the "willing" or "voluntary" cuckold is expressed elsewhere in the play (X. 10, 93), by Gaywit in particular: "And I am mistaken, if many husbands in this town do not live very comfortably by being content with their infamy, nay, by being promoters of it" (35). 37 See above, n. 5. *1 In "the hunting adventure" in JA (Bk. III, ch. vi) F similarly calls the squire's attendants "dogs of his own species"—"human . . . curs," who, he remarks, "did indeed no great honor to the canine kind" (I. 269-270, 276). 2 When referring to Diogenes the Cynic, F invariably stressed the root meaning of the Greek kynikos (dog-like, currish): e.g. TG (XII. 251), "the cynic's snarling pride"; DAD (XVI. 80, 83). *3 In "the hunting adventure" in JA (I. 269) F likens the malevolent squire to Nimrod, thus emphasizing the analogy in the first edition: "he was a great Hunter of Men ". *4 For F's use of such compounds as "Fellow-Creatures" and "Fellow-Subjects" (below), see above, "Physiognomist," n. 1. A constant theme of F's writings is that tyrants and conquerors—such "great men" as Alexander, Caesar, Charles XII of Sweden—have throughout history satisfied their ambitions at the cost of thousands ruined and destroyed: cf. V (XV. 43, n.), where he speaks of the "honours in all ages paid to conquerors (alias robbers) tyrants (alias murderers) and prime ministers (alias plunderers)"; also DQE (XI. 32), TG (XII. 251), N (XIV. 317), DAD (XVI. 78-9, 80-81). The theme recurs in JW (e.g. II. 2-3, 46, 105), but with the phrasing of the present passage, cf. the following, describing "a CONQUEROR , a TYRANT . . . at the head of a multitude of prigs, called an army, to molest their neighbors; to introduce rape, rapine, bloodshed, and every kind of misery among their own species " (66-67, emphasis added); " conquerors who have . . . destroyed the countries and cities of their fellow-creatures , from no other provocation than that of glory " (204, emphasis added). 5 References to Pope in F's works are plentiful, and in this early period they are not always complimentary, especially when he was composing poems for the eyes of Lady Mary. In D (p. 224) he disparages Windsor Forest ; but no doubt his true opinion of that poem is expressed in JVL (XVI. 248) and in EL (p. 242): "I too with thee and with the World admire / The Bard in Windsor Groves who strung his Lyre." 6 Among many other references in his works, see Ch (15 Mar. 1739/40), where F discusses Ovid's "exuberance of fancy" in the Metamorphoses , "that admirable work." 7 In TrT (IX. 60) the Queen has read the story of Danae "In Dryden's Ovid's Metamorphosis." 8 In TJ (V. 254) Western declares: "I'd rather be run by my own dogs, as one Acton was, that the story-book says was turned into a hare, and his own dogs killed un and eat un." 9 Cf. DQE (XI. 17-18): "Sir, your true English squire and his hounds are as inseparable as your Spanish and his Toledo. He eats with his hounds, drinks with his hounds, and lies with his hounds; your true arrant English squire is but the first dog-boy in his house." Also F (XII. 188), where it is said that only "something of vast importance" could draw Sir Gregory Kennel from his foxhounds. *10 Ovid, Metamorphoses , III. 206-225. F burlesques this celebrated passage in "the hunting adventure" in JA (I. 271-272), where Adams, like Actæon, is set upon by the hounds—Rockwood and Jowler, Ringwood and Fairmaid and Caesar, Thunder and Plunder, and Wonder and Blunder. "Ringwood" is a name used by both Arthur Golding and George Sandys in their translations of this passage. 11 Cf. D (p. 224): "Ovid's Numbers please the Latins most." 12 With the irony of the word "noble" applied to the sound of hunting dogs in full cry, cf. TJ (IV. 305): "a pack of hounds began to open their melodious throats." Cf. also GSO (rev., p. 86), DQE (XI. 17), Ch (17 Jan. 1739/40), JA (I. 267). 13 One of F's favorite terms, which he used both in the technical sense of the denouement of a play and in the looser sense of an unhappy final event: e.g. Trt (IX. 10, 71 n. 140), P (XI. 193), F (XII. 231), EH (XI. 305), JA (I. 99, 162, 205), RALF (XVI. 102), JW (II. 146, 158, 194, 197, 199), TJ (IV. 169, 194). 14 Cf. JA (I. 268), where the hounds similarly mistake Adams for their usual game: "some of them (by mistake perhaps for the hare's skin) laid hold of the skirts of his cassock." Adams, indeed, narrowly escapes the fate of Actæon; for the "hounds, in devouring" the hare, thus began to worry the parson, and had he not wakened in time, "must certainly have tasted his flesh, which delicious flavor might have been fatal to him" (269). 15 This formula, which occurs in Cicero's De Natura Deorum (III. xxxii. 81: "Dies deficiat si velim enumerare"), also occurs in Ch (21 Feb. 1739/40): "It would be needless . . . to enumerate any more instances"; cf. also PRS (XV. 73, quoted above, "Lanthorn," n. 3). Often F alters the Latin, as in CS (13 May 1738), "si velim omnia percurrere Dies deficeret": e.g. TP (28 Jan. 1746), CGJ (7 Jan. 1752), and Englished in Ch (1 Mar. 1739/40), "It would be endless to run through the several branches of this art." 16 Cf. RR (IX, 143), where Dabble reads "the Lying Post" to Politic: "'Fontainbleau, January the 23rd. Yesterday his Majesty went a hunting." Also F (XII. 193), where Young Kennel has been "hunting with the King of France." 17 In Ch (4 Sept. 1740) it is said that country squires "devote their Lives to the Destruction of wild Beasts." 18 In JA (I. 273) the hunting squire enjoys "bull or bear baiting" and the bitch "Fairmaid" has "worried bulls" (272). 19 In MH Mr. Woodall is such a politician (X. 21-23). 20 Cf. Mi (X. 189): "you have started a wild-goose chase." *21 Cf. Ch (29 July 1740, "Home News"): Walpole and his party, now meeting at Houghton, "are principally taken up with laying out for a new Pack of stanch Hounds to stock the m[inisteria]l Kennel: In which not only no Pains or Expence will be spar'd to see that they are fleet-footed, well-mouth'd, quick-nostrill'd, &amp;c. but, likewise, to teach them to leap over a Stick, fetch and carry, and perform all the Tricks of the most tractable Spaniels ." 22 Cf. the huntsman in JA (I. 272-3), who "lifted his voice, and called his hounds from the fight, telling them, in a language they understood, that it was in vain to contend longer." Western, too, knows "how to encourage the dogs with his voice, and to animate the hunt with his holla"; and he is skillful "in drawing the dogs when they were at a fault" ( TJ , IV. 306-307). *23 As in JA (I. 112) this was F's chief complaint about hunters: "'He no more regarded a field of wheat when he was hunting than he did the highway; that he had injured several poor farmers by trampling their corn under his horse's heels . . . . [he] pursued his game over a field of corn"; this is also true of the squire who shoots the Wilsons' dog (I. 259), as it is of Western and his fellow sportsmen in TJ (IV. 305). See also DQE (XI. 18), Ch (8 Dec. 1739). 24 Cf. L (VIII. 270): "The Sportsman esteems / The horse . . . / That leaps o'er a pitiful gate"—an activity in which both Frank Kennel ( F , XII. 189) and Tom Jones (III. 140) excel. 25 The huntsman in JA (I. 274) hopes the hounds that attacked Adams have not learned to "follow vermin instead of sticking to a hare"; in a note (278, n.) F refers to hounds "that will hunt fox or other vermin." Also TJ (III. 268). 26 Cf. DQE (XI. 40): "Poor Reynard ceases flight." *27 Cf. Grizzle's simile in TT (p. 27), who declares that Thumb "made" the giants he claims to have killed, "As Fox-hunters bring Foxes to a Wood, / And then with Hounds they drive them out again"; also TrT (IX. 31-32). And Scut the huntsman's song in DQE (XI. 39): "A brushing fox in yonder wood / Secure to find we seek; / For why, I carried, sound and good, / A cartload there last week." 28 Cf. Western in TJ (IX. 306): "the squire pursued over hedge and ditch, with all his usual . . . alacrity." This recklessness causes Sophia to implore Jones "not to lead her father through so many dangers in hunting . . . . not to ride so madly, nor to take those dangerous leaps" (III. 160). Also DQE (XI. 40). *29 Perhaps F's favorite way of describing one who risks bodily injury: e.g. in GSO (IX. 245) Robin warns William that he will overturn the coach "and break both master and mistress's necks; it is always neck or nothing with you"; in TJ (III. 26) F fears that his description of Allworthy's estate will bring "the reader's neck . . . into danger" and he worries "how to get thee down without breaking thy neck" (28). In the same novel it is said that "none who . . . set much value on their necks" (III. 345) would pass through a certain bad neighborhood. But with the present context and phrasing, cf. esp. (194), where Sophia Western by accompanying her father in the chase, hopes "to restrain his impetuosity, and to prevent him from so frequently exposing his neck to the utmost hazard"; and Tow-wouse in JA (I. 87), who "ran downstairs without any fear of breaking his neck." *30 Cf. TJ (IV. 306-07): "Sportsmen, in the warmth of a chase, are too much engaged to attend to any manner of ceremony, nay, even to the offices of humanity: for, if any of them meet with an accident by tumbling into a ditch, or into a river, the rest pass on regardless, and generally leave him to his fate." In "the hunting adventure" in JA (I. 268) F dramatizes this behavior of hunters. 31 F often expressed his admiration for Addison, whose periodical, The Freeholder (1715-16), provided him with topics and ideas for TP and JJ . 32 Cf. Ch (20 Dec. 1739): "'tis my humble Opinion (for I should be very loath to enter the Lists with so formidable a Champion as Ovid) . . . ." 33 Cf. TrT (IX. 8): "as it is indeed in some measure incumbent on me"; RR (IX. 147): "I think it incumbent on us all"; JW (II. 164): "The good magistrate . . . thought it incumbent on him." 34 F often insists on this point: e.g. in Ch (29 Mar. 1740) he declares that "There is nothing so unjustifiable as the general abuse of any nation or body of men," and regrets "the custom of throwing scandal on a whole profession for the vices of some particular members." See also Ch (12 Feb., 6 Mar. 1739/40), Co (XIV. 271), TJ (IV. 33). 35 Cf. Ch (15 Apr. 1740) again referring to Walpole: "But . . . my readers will easily suggest to themselves numberless instances of this consummate inperfection, at least every one will be able to furnish himself with the instance of one whose greatness they can account for only from his excellence in badness in every kind." *36 F used this expression repeatedly: e.g. Ch (16 Feb. 1739/40) "This virtue [charity] hath shone forth brighter in our time"; (21 Feb. 1739/40) "one [species of charity] which shines forth in a very particular manner"; (22 July 1740) "to shine forth in gilded Equipages abroad"; DAD (XVI. 81) "There is more greatness . . . in thee than at present shines forth"; TJ (III. 179) "Sophia shone forth that day with more gayety and sprightliness than usual." 37 Cf. Ch (20 Nov. 1739) members of learned societies "might have shined out very illustriously"; (29 Nov. 1739) "Qualities, that would add a Lustre"; TJ (III. 354) "beauty in its highest lustre"; (IV. 249) "Daylight . . . in its full lustre." 38 Alluding, no doubt, to the suppression of Gay's Polly in December 1728. F praised Gay in Ch (1 Mar. 1739/40, 6 Sept. 1740); but in D , which satirizes the Scriblerus group, Gay is ridiculed as Ilar and Polly is represented as a "Dull, senseless Libel level'd at the Great" (p. 230; also 237-239). 39 Cf. Mi (X. 236) "His game is sure to lead him a long chase"; L (VIII. 274) "What a chase has this girl led me!" *40 Cf. TJ (III. 139): Black George "espied a hare sitting in her form. This hare he had basely and barbarously knocked on the head, against . . . the laws of sportsmen."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">More Light on the Life and Milieu of Robert Thornton by George R. Keiser *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the publication of an earlier study, I have had opportunity to devote further attention to the life and milieu of Robert Thornton, the scribe who, probably late in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, copied two of the most interesting manuscript anthologies of Middle English literature, Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91 and B. L. MS. Additional 31,042. 1 While I am, regrettably, unable to report the discovery of any new documents concerning the scribe, I am able to show that consideration of those already known does permit additional, if tentative, answers to some of the more intriguing questions concerning Robert Thornton—specifically, how he might have received his education and how he might have acquired the many texts he copied into his two manuscripts. The first of these documents is an entry in the Yorkshire Archbishop's Register, dated 5 February 1397-8, in which Robert Thornton "de Neuton," presumably the father of the scribe, is granted permission to have masses and other services celebrated in a chapel at East Newton, the manor held by the Thornton family in the North Riding of Yorkshire. 2 This information would seem to support the idea that the scribe was educated at home by a visiting cleric, rather than at one of the nearby grammar schools in Helmsley, Hovingham, or Malton (pp. 164-165). If the scribe had reached his majority by 1418 when, according to the Thornton pedigree prepared in the seventeenth century (pp. 159-160), his father died and he succeeded to the lordship of East Newton, he must have been at least one year old, and probably older, by 5 February 1397-8. Perhaps Robert Thornton the elder, seeing his son and heir passing from infancy to boyhood, thought this a fit time to arrange for regular visits by a cleric, possibly a chantry priest from Helmsley, who would celebrate mass and other services for the entire family and conduct the education of the scribe. This idea has a very strong sentimental attraction. Installed at a period when devotionalism and piety were assuming immense significance in the lives of the English laity, the chapel continued to be the center of spiritual life at East Newton for many future generations 3 and was surely the place where the devotional writings copied by Robert Thornton the scribe were meant to be read. It is appropriate then that there should have been a close relation between that chapel and the education of the scribe. On the subject of Robert Thornton's education and his motivation in undertaking the laborious task of copying the two manuscripts, it is of value to look again at several documents concerning the manors of Great Edston and Northolm in northern Ryedale. Previously, I noted that the name of Robert Thornton appears in the witness lists in three sets of documents, dated 1442, 1448-9, and 1468, 4 concerning land transactions at these manors, and I suggested that Thornton may have had some particular interest in these transactions (pp. 161-162). That he did indeed have such an interest seems likely. The account of Great Edston in the Victoria County History for the North Riding of Yorkshire informs us that in 1303 Walter Romayne settled the manor on Walter de Holme who later settled it "on his heirs male by his second wife Iseult with contingent remainders to the heirs male of his brothers Roger and Thomas and final remainder to the heirs male of his daughter Joan." When John de Holme, the male heir, and Roger and Thomas died without issue male, Joan entered into possession of the manor. "In 1376 her claim was disputed under the first settlement by Walter de Bergh, Robert Thornton [presumably the grandfather of the scribe] and John son of Nicholas de Topcliffe, descendants of Agnes and Alice, sisters of Walter Romayne. The plaintiffs in this suit were presumably unsuccessful." 5 A closer look at some of the documents in which his name appears bears out the point that Robert Thornton had particular interest in these transactions. Among the first set of documents are quitclaim deeds for Great Edston and Northolm, in which Maud (or Matilda) del Clay, a great-granddaughter of John de Holme, released the manors to William Holthorp, a grandson of Joan (i.e., Walter de Holme's daughter). The sealing of these quitclaims by John Thirsk, mayor of York, and their entry in both the York Memorandum Book 6 and the Close Rolls seems to prove that the memory of the 1376 suit was still fresh and the conflicting claims to the manor still a matter of some concern to the parties involved in the transactions. The appearance of Robert Thornton's name in the witness lists for these and the other documents concerning Great Edston and Northolm surely indicates that his cooperation was at least desirable. That the full consent of Thornton and his family may have been almost necessary is suggested by the presence of Thomas Gray of Barton, probably a Thornton relative if the pedigree is accurate in reporting that the scribe's mother was Isabel de Gray, in the first set of documents and William Thornton, presumably the scribe's son, in the third set of documents. Aside from showing us that Robert Thornton did have a special interest in these transactions, this additional information encourages us to look a little more closely at Thornton's connections with Robert Stillyngton, the unscrupulous, politically ambitious bishop of Bath and Wells and chancellor of England. Stillyngton, it is now clear, was the nephew of William Holthorp the elder, to whom Maud del Clay released Great Edston and Northolm in 1442, and may even have been a distant relative of the scribe. The fact that Thornton and Stillyngton were not very close in age is sufficient reason for supposing that the two men had little, if any, close personal association. Still, it is significant that they emerge from a common background, for their achievements attest to the idea that at least from the later years of the fourteenth century the Yorkshire gentry was beginning to recognize the importance of, perhaps even the necessity for, literacy. 7 Surely, events such as the dispute over Great Edston and Northolm—suggesting as it does the problems that arose for members of the gentry intent on realizing their ambitions through the acquisition of land—must have contributed to the awareness of the importance of literacy in the pursuit of their ambitions. Robert Thornton, coming from a family of more modest means, received a more modest education and satisfied the intellectual curiosity and spiritual desires that it awakened by reading widely in vernacular writings and compiling materials for his manuscripts, whereas Stillyngton, coming from a wealthier family and coming along a generation later, proceeded through Oxford 8 and on to a remarkable, if not an altogether admirable, political career. Ironically, though it would probably have seemed otherwise to a fifteenth-century observer, Thornton's achievement was more enduring. The third and most interesting point to be made about the life and milieu of Robert Thornton concerns the relation of the scribe and his neighbors, the Pikeryngs of Oswaldkirk. The record of mutual land interests and the fact that Robert Thornton served as an executor of the will of Sir Richard Pikeryng, a will in which he and a brother received handsome bequests from the testator (pp. 160-161), lead to the conclusion that the two men and their families must have been on fairly intimate terms. That the relationship between the two families helped Thornton to obtain texts for reading and copying is an idea that I should now like to explore. While my earlier study was in press, I had the good fortune to come upon Bodleian MS. Rawlinson A.393, which contains an early sixteenthcentury text of the Liber de diversis medicinis that is closely related to the text of the Liber now preserved in Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91. 9 Marginalia in the Rawlinson MS. make clear that John Rede, the scribe, had access to a text owned by the Pikeryngs of Oswaldkirk. Although very close to the text found in the Lincoln MS., the Rawlinson text is often superior to it and must, therefore, have been copied from the same exemplar or one closely related to it. Thus, it would appear that Robert Thornton probably borrowed his exemplar from the Pikeryngs and not, as had previously seemed likely, from the unnamed rector of Oswaldkirk whose probatum is cited frequently in both the Lincoln and Rawlinson MSS. Establishing that the Pikeryngs of Oswaldkirk probably owned one book leads us to ask whether that book might have contained more than the Liber de diversis medicinis and whether there might have been other books in the household. The public records reveal that Sir Richard Pikeryng was a man of comfortable means and some prestige; his landholdings and his service as sheriff and as justice of the peace would have brought him into touch with a large portion of the Yorkshire gentry, doubtless including some who owned books. 10 The marginalia in Rawlinson A.393 indicate that his sixteenth-century descendants had close connections with the Percies. Whether that connection extends back to Sir Richard's time is uncertain. At the very least, through his connections with other members of the gentry, Sir Richard could have been the source for some of the texts that Robert Thornton copied. A closer look at the will of Sir Richard Pikeryng suggests yet another source within the Pikeryng family for some of the texts that Thornton copied, for among the bequests is one of very special interest: "It e m lego domine Iohanne Pikeringe moniali de Monkton sorori mee xl s." 11 Although we have no conclusive proof, there is, as I shall show, sufficient evidence to suggest that Joan Pikeryng might have provided Robert Thornton with a substantial portion of the devotional writings that are preserved in the Lincoln MS. Information concerning the priory of St. Mary at Nun Monkton, though very limited, does show that throughout the last two centuries of its existence it was a favorite of many prosperous and literate Yorkshire families, some of whose daughters were in residence there. 12 Testamentary evidence makes this point clear. The 1345 will of Robert de Playce (TE 1.11), a rector of Brompton who owned several books, contains a bequest to aid a niece who was to become a nun at one of three convents, including Nun Monkton. In 1346 John de Thorp (TE 1.31), a canon at York cathedral and rector of Wetheringstrete, Norwich, made numerous bequests to the convent church at Nun Monkton and requested burial there, next to Alice de Thorpe, a former prioress. In 1393 John Fayrfax (TE 1.187-90), rector of Prestcote, who owned both service books and books of civil and canon law, left various grants of money to Nun Monkton and its residents, including Margaret Pikeryng and Elizabeth Fayrfax, his sister. In addition, he bequeathed some personal items to another sister Margaret, prioress at Nun Monkton, who served as a supervisor and a coadjutor for the executors of the will. 13 In 1402 there was a bequest to Nun Monkton from Sir John Depeden of Helagh (TE 1.298), who owned several books himself and was a close associate of John Neuton, the treasurer of York cathedral and a bibliophile. The priory also received bequests of money and goods, in 1418, from Master Stephan le Scrop (TE 1.386), who was archdeacon of Richmond, chancellor of Cambridge University, younger son of Stephen, Lord Scrop, of Masham and Upsale, and owner of a substantial library. In 1433 Thomas Palmes of Naburn, armiger (TE 2.31), husband of Alice, daughter of John Pikeryng of Ellerton, bequeathed money to the priory itself and to Joan Pikeryng, nun at Nun Monkton and, apparently, Sir Richard's sister. In the 1468 inventory of Elizabeth Sywardby, whose exceptional collection of books I discussed in the earlier study of Robert Thornton (p. 172), there is an accounting of the expenses incurred on behalf of the testator's niece and namesake, Elizabeth, when she entered the priory at Nun Monkton (TE 3.168). It is not until the mid-fifteenth century that we find books bequeathed to the nuns at Nun Monkton priory. The first of these bequests is most interesting, for it is a book of Vices and Virtues given to the priory in 1448 by Agnes Stapilton, whose will indicates that she owned a substantial library. 14 This testator was, it appears, the mother of Sir Brian, who was a Member of Parliament for Yorkshire when Robert Thornton served as a tax collector for the North Riding. Other of her children had married into the Ingilby and Plumpton families, which had close associations with, respectively, the Charterhouses at Mount Grace and Beauvale—a point to which we shall return. In 1479-80 John Burns (TE 3.199n), a York chaplain, bequeathed an English book of the Pater Noster and other works to the prioress and convent. A third bequest, also of some special interest, is a book "in Anglicis de Vita Domini nostri Jhesu Christi," given in 1485-6 by Thomas Hornby to Elizabeth Sywardby, "moniali de Monkton" (TE 3.165n). Perhaps this is the same book as the one described as "alio libro de Vita Christi, in lingua materna" (TE 3.163) in the 1468 inventory of the nun's aunt. That there were books at the priory of Nun Monkton before 1448—even a decade or so earlier, when Robert Thornton might have begun to copy his manuscripts—seems a reasonable supposition. Agnes Stapilton must have attached great value to the books she bequeathed and would surely not have given the book of Vices and Virtues to Nun Monkton unless she had known that its residents were prepared to appreciate the value of the book. Moreover, given the long tradition of writings for recluses and nuns in England and the fact that book-ownership and literacy in the vernacular were becoming increasingly common among women from better families throughout the fifteenth century, it is hard to believe that those sisters and daughters of the literate Yorkshire gentry in residence at Nun Monkton would not have had some enthusiasm for books, as well as the ability to read them. Several texts in the Thornton MS. at Lincoln seem to have been adapted, perhaps by female scribes, to suit an audience of women, presumably at a religious house. For example, near the end of the Thornton text of The Mirror of St. Edmund , the usual form of address to the audience, "Dere frende," gives way to "Dere Syster and frende" (L 209r-v; YW 240). 15 Midway through the text of Walter Hilton's Epistle on Mixed Life the customary use of "a man" gives way briefly to "A man or a woman"; a few lines later we find an injunction addressed to "dere syster" (L 225r; YW 278). Similarly, near the end of the Thornton text of "Of the vertu3 of the Haly Name of Ihesu," the customary "he" gives way to "he or scho" (L 193v; YW 191). This evidence, though not overwhelming, is sufficient to suggest that Thornton probably obtained his exemplars for these works from a house for female religious. One other text in the Lincoln MS., which would be of special interest to a house of nuns, deserves consideration in this discussion of the idea that Robert Thornton had access to books owned by female religious. "A Reuelacyone schewed to ane holy womane now one late tyme" is an account of several gruesome dream-visions of purgatory, told by an unnamed woman who experienced them in 1422 and who is identified as a recluse in the text of the visions found in Longleat MS. 29. 16 In these visions of purgatory as a kind of barbecue pit for burning away sins we hear about the sufferings of lecherous priests, who must endure the greatest pains, as well as the sufferings of wedded and single men and women, but mostly we hear about the sufferings of one Margaret, "the whilke woman was in hir lyfe a syster of ane house of relygyone" (L 251r; YW 384). Reflecting the affective devotionalism and Marian piety so popular in its time, "A Reuelacyone" is larded with details of the skewering, burning, bathing in pitch, and gnawing by snakes and adders that Margaret and the other sinners must endure before being granted the oil of mercy and led to heaven by the Virgin. The texts of "A Reuelacyone" in Longleat and Bodleian MS. th. c.58 indicate, as does the reference to the recluse of Westminster, that the work had its origins in London. While both of these manuscripts are of interest to students of Lincoln MS. 91, the Bodleian MS. is especially so because it has a bearing on the present discussion. Probably once part of a large devotional book, the Bodleian MS. contains, along with a fragmentary text of "A Reuelacyone," a fragmentary text of the Passion section of the pseudo-Bonaventuran Meditationes Vitae Christi translated by Nicholas Love of the Charterhouse at Mount Grace. Thus, its similarity to Lincoln MS. 91 extends beyond the fact that both contain "A Reuelacyone," for the Thornton MS. preserves a text of another translation of the Passion section of the pseudo-Bonaventuran Meditationes . From these facts we may conclude that these roughly contemporary manuscripts attest not only to the similarity of devotional exercises in London and Yorkshire, but also to the exchange of devotional writings between these two distant parts of the kingdom. The temptation to speculate on the means by which the movement of these texts was effected is irresistible. Certainly, Nicholas Love's translation of Meditationes reached London early in the fifteenth century through the efforts of the Carthusians, passing from Mount Grace in Yorkshire to, presumably, the Charterhouse in London, from whence it was disseminated widely. It is conceivable that "A Reuelacyone" made its northward journey through the same channels and that, directly or indirectly, Robert Thornton's version was derived from an exemplar kept at Mount Grace. On the other hand, it is not impossible that there was some movement of manuscripts, similar to that which we can document in the case of the Carthusians, between other houses, as a result of which "A Reuelacyone" came northward through, say, Benedictine channels to Nun Monkton. Of course, the religious houses of Yorkshire (or elsewhere, for that matter) did not exist in isolation from each other, and there must have been cooperation among them in the compilation of devotional writings. A. I. Doyle calls attention to the relations among three fifteenth-century devotional books that had their origins in Yorkshire religious houses—B. L. MS. Stowe 39, which belonged to a Benedictine house of monks or nuns; B. L. MS. Faustina B.VI, which belonged to a nunnery, probably Benedictine; and B. L. MS. Additional 37,049, which was apparently produced at the Charterhouse at Mount Grace. "The texts and pictures vary from one to another, but it seems from both that Stowe and Faustina may be from a common source, with Add. a little removed, but not far therefrom" (Doyle, II.192). Further reinforcing the associations among the religious houses was the network of familial connections among laymen, such as we saw above in the case of the Stapiltons, the Ingilbys, and the Plumptons. Thus, it could well be that the Carthusians, distinguished for "the corporate transmission of the spiritual teaching" of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, 17 might have been responsible for the expeditious transit of "A Reuelacyone" from London to Yorkshire and, perhaps, to Robert Thornton, by way of Nun Monkton. Having established that the women of Nun Monkton may very well have had books when Robert Thornton was compiling his manuscripts and that he probably obtained some of his devotional texts from a nunnery, the appearance of Joan Pikeryng in her brother's will assumes great significance. Surely, she is the likely candidate for the role of supplier of these devotional texts to her brother's friend and associate. These speculations concerning Nun Monkton and Joan Pikeryng and indeed all the foregoing arguments, based as they are on circumstantial evidence, must be very tentative and qualified. In the absence of more informative documentary evidence, one must make the most of what is available without resorting to distortion or exceeding the bounds of the plausible. What is certain, I believe, is that as we look further into the life and milieu of Robert Thornton of East Newton, we have no reason to doubt that B. L. MS. Additional 31,042 and Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91 could have been compiled by such a man living in such a milieu as I have attempted to describe in this and my preceding study. That a man who led, in most respects, an entirely ordinary life as a member of the minor gentry in later medieval Yorkshire might have had a sufficiently strong interest in the written word to read so widely and copy the two manuscripts, as well as the learning and opportunity to do so, seems reasonable. Thus, we have no need to suppose that Robert Thornton's endeavors in copying these books were a result of a desire to turn a penny or to curry favor with his social betters. 18 On the contrary, from the outline of the life of Robert Thornton and, judging from the contents of his manuscripts, the interests that he shared with others of the middle classes whom we know owned books, we can see that the audience who would devour the editions of romances and devotional writings published by Wynkyn de Worde at the turn of the century was already coming into being, fully two generations before the prudent Alsatian printer took over from William Caxton and began catering to their tastes and interests.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Scribal Self-Corrections in the Thornton Morte Arthure by Mary Hamel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—Here endes Morte Arthure writen by Robert of Thornton 1 The problem of editing Middle English texts is basically one of evidence: if a poem survives in a number of manuscripts, one must choose among alternative readings, basing the decisions made on judgments about which alternative is more likely to be original, which more probably in error. If there is only one manuscript of a text available, the editor may be forced to rely on his own common sense and knowledge of medieval language and style in order to identify errors. In either case the process requires some familiarity with the mechanics of medieval book production and some understanding of the habits of reading and writing characteristic of the age—for example, the fact that a scribe's verbal sense was more likely to be auditory than visual. 2 In short, the editor's task is primarily one of evaluation, by whatever means available or appropriate, of the body or bodies of evidence before him. In recent decades there has been an increasing emphasis on the analysis of scribal tendencies as a means of evaluating such evidence—on the face of it a sensible approach, since an understanding of the kinds of errors to which scribes were commonly subject, or the kinds of changes they were likely to make, at least establishes a range of probabilities against which a questionable reading may be measured. It appears that generalizations are possible, not only about commonly recognized errors such as c/t confusion and homoeoteleuton, but also about such things as the tendency of fifteenth-century scribes to regularize or increase alliteration in such a poem as Piers Plowman . 3 But generalizations about scribal tendencies, of course, may or may not be applicable to the tradition of any one text. An example is the alliterative Morte Arthure , which appears in the unique Thornton MS text (Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91, fols. 53-98v) to have a number of alliterative irregularities. Whatever one's conclusions about whether those irregularities are authorial or scribal, it appears that the poem's succession of scribes did not participate to any marked extent in the general tendency of their contemporaries to regularize or increase alliteration. 4 For descriptions of scribal tendencies are based on statistical inference from the scribal habits of individuals and are not necessarily applicable to every individual. On the other hand, intensive analysis of the characteristics of individual scribes is in most cases of limited usefulness, because of their normal anonymity; Scribe A 's habits in transcribing Text X are relevant only to that text, if no other transcriptions can be identified as his. But there are cases in which the habits of an individual scribe are significant, cases in which a known individual has copied a variety of texts, and in which therefore the conclusions derived from his transcription of one text may be useful in evaluating his transcriptions of others. Such a scribe is Robert Thornton, lord of East Newton in Ryedale, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, in the earlier fifteenth century. 5 Although apparently an amateur, he made copies of many important texts. The two extant volumes known to have come from his pen, the "Thornton MS" itself and BL Addit. MS 31042, contain many romances as well as other texts both devotional and secular; the scribe is a factor to be reckoned with by students of such texts as The Awntyrs off Arthure , Sir Degrevant , Sir Eglamour of Artois , Thomas of Ercildoune , The Parlement of the Thre Ages , Winner and Waster , The Siege of Jerusalem , Richard Rolle's treatises and poems, and a miscellany of other works. 6 The importance of this scribe, and the recent publication of the Scolar Press facsimile of the Lincoln MS (see note 5 above), have led to increased interest in him in the last few years. The exhaustive researches of George R. Keiser, for example, establish Thornton as "a man of some moderate prestige and influence," who "had a fairly ordinary life as an active, though by no means a leading citizen of Ryedale and the North Riding"; more important, he was "an avid reader and a man of industry, enthusiasm, and ambition" whose access to texts available in his region must have been at least partly the result of active search and inveterate book-borrowing. 7 Other scholars, however, have been led by the careful organization of Thornton's two anthologies, the general "expertness" of his scribal operations, the surprising skill of some of his decorations, and the mere bulk of his material to question his amateur status. 8 Nevertheless, the birth-record of the scribe's grandson Robert "in Ridayll anno d o m ini m cccc liij" on fol. 49v of the Lincoln MS makes the identity of the scribe Robert Thornton with the landholder and active country gentleman Robert Thornton more than merely plausible (Keiser, p. 159), and the scribe's amateur status must be accepted. It appears, in fact, that Thornton was an amateur in the best sense of the word, loving his avocation enough to train himself in the requisite skills and to employ them conscientiously, if not always consistently. Indeed, it may be because Thornton was not a professional scribe that he stands out as an individual, and it is appropriate that at least one of his compilations has come to be known by his name. The history of the "Thornton MS" is closely connected with that of his family, for it remained at East Newton until the late seventeenth century. 9 The selection of works included shows that Thornton was copying texts for his and his family's private use: it is just such a compendium of entertainment, instruction, religious edification, and practical advice as one might expect to find in the domestic library of a moderately bookish fifteenth-century gentleman's household. And, from the marginal scribblings and evidences of early mending, it was clearly well used as long as Thornton's descendents were capable of reading his language. One might expect, then, that the scribe, not intending public circulation, would exercise considerable freedom in adapting the texts he copied for personal use. Yet several editors of Thornton texts have attested that, dialect aside, the scribe exhibited a remarkable fidelity to his texts. 10 And even in terms of dialect, he only " half -transform[ed] his original," adding "a Yorkshire veneer" to texts he copied from other dialectal regions. 11 Certainly, in preserving archaisms and rare words, including technical terms presumably outside his experience, Thornton seems to have been unusual among scribes. One might take as example the lively scene of preparation for the sea-battle at Southampton near the end of Morte Arthure (lines 3599-3711); here the poet's own familarity with and fondness for the details of shipping and ship-battles come through unimpaired. But this passage is interesting not only for its portrayal of topcastle and stem, sail and hatch, but even more for the terms inaccurately reproduced by the scribe—e.g., bilynge for "bilge" (3663), vpcynes for "upties" (3675). 12 Unlike many other scribes, Thornton seems not to have felt the need to rationalize or emend corruptions in his copytext; there are a number of places where he appears to have contented himself with reproducing words that looked as though they might mean something. 13 In short, Robert Thornton's status as a country gentleman, devoutly religious, head of a substantial family, may have had some influence on his choice of texts to copy; certainly his education and experience must have influenced his treatment of the texts; but whatever his activities or background, he appears to have exercised an extraordinary care in reproducing them, a care informed not only by his sense of their interest or usefulness but also apparently by a respect for them in themselves. Thornton's carefulness may have been due at least partly to his amateur status; lacking professional training as a scribe, he was free from the prescribed routines, techniques, and conventions of the scriptorium. What this means for the scribe's practice is that he was forced to rely on his models, his copy, as the only available guides to the representation of text. He was more liable than a professional scribe would have been to be influenced by the letter-forms, the spellings, the abbreviations, the punctuation, the line-divisions he saw before him, less prone to translate such incidentals of transcription into his own (or his shop's) systems and conventions. This tendency has led one or two of his editors to see more than one scribe at work in the transcription of the two MSS. L. F. Casson, for example, the editor of Sir Degrevant , found a "considerable variation" in the handwriting of the Lincoln MS as a whole and cited the opinion of Eric G. Millar that the London MS was also probably in different hands. Millar, recognizing that "apparent variations in size or general appearance may be due only to a change of pen or a different quality in the ink," based his judgment primarily on the increased use of thorn and a "rather different" et -symbol after fol. 66v (Casson, p. ix). But with an amateur scribe like Thornton one must also take into account the fact that fol. 66v in the London MS marks the beginning of a new work, The Sege of Melayne ; it is probably the scribe of Thornton's copy-text for this work who was responsible for its graphemic differences from the preceding material. 14 A similar circumstance may be found in the Lincoln MS; in the texts of the Prose Life of Alexander (fols. 1-49) and Sir Percyuell of Gales (fols. 161-176) the older form of thorn is used (that is, it has a straight descender without a flourish), whereas elsewhere in the MS thorn is normally indistinguishable from y ; the difference once again is presumably due to the usage in Thornton's copy-texts for these works. Thus, although the scribe's lack of professionalism might be seen as a reason for distrust of his texts, his very inconsistency of practice, and the dependence on his models that it implies, may offer the editor fuller access to previous stages of transmission than a professional scribe's systematic habits and conventions normally afford. This is not to say, of course, that Thornton was a scribe without habits and systems of his own; all his texts show evidence of a spelling system strongly influenced by his own dialect, for example. Nor can it be supposed that his texts are error-free; his lack of professional training did not prevent him from sharing in trained scribes' mistakes and misjudgments, not only reproducing those of his copy-texts but also contributing a number of his own. It may be objected that it is a task of formidable difficulty to distinguish the errors of one scribe from those of his predecessors in the transmission of a text. One aspect of Robert Thornton's care as a scribe has not been remarked by his editors, however: that is, his alertness in correcting his own errors. 15 In my own transcription of Morte Arthure , for example, I have found several hundred self-corrections. Many of these are quite minor, yet this tendency affords an unusual opportunity: to define a scribe's characteristic errors in terms of what he himself saw as error in his transcription. Although such an approach must leave out of account unrecognized errors, it does at least distinguish Thornton's errors from those of his predecessors. Or does it? One question that must be considered in such an investigation is the extent to which such changes represent actual corrections—that is, reassertions of the copy-text's forms and spellings—and the extent to which they represent deliberate alterations influenced by the scribe's own dialect or by his own judgment about correctness, explicitness, intelligibility, emphasis, or elegance. 16 Definitive answers on questions of dialectal change must await the publication of McIntosh and Samuels' Survey of Middle English Dialects, although Professor McIntosh has provided a few clues in his 1962 article (see note 11 above). Until then one must depend on hints and guesses gleaned from more traditional and less precise surveys. 17 Other Thornton texts also provide some guidelines, particularly the "Thornton Medical Book," which appears to represent the scribe's own dialect more consistently than any other of his texts. 18 In spite of such uncertainties, it may be significant that, although some of these corrections do show apparent dialectal influence, none of them shows a deliberate change from the Midland &lt;o&gt; spelling of OE ā to the Northern &lt;a&gt;. The question of editorial (as opposed to dialectal) change may be more accessible to analysis. The purpose of this study, then, is by the detailed analysis of Thornton's self-corrected errors in Morte Arthure to derive conclusions about his characteristic errors, tendencies to err, and possible editorial tendencies, as well as about his habits and systems of transcription. Conclusions about the scribe's practices are supported by a statistical analysis of frequency of error at various points of the alliterative long line, which also identifies patterns of weakness within the line. The conclusions reached, one hopes, will be of use not only to students of other Thornton texts but also to critics of Alliterative Revival texts more generally; for Thornton's patterns of error are probably not unique to him. An understanding of Thornton's tendencies to err depends in part on familiarity with his characteristic handwriting, which, like other hands of the period, was likely to give rise to certain kinds of error. In Derek Brewer's words (p. vii) Thornton's is "a fairly typical mid-fifteenth-century cursive hand" which "varies considerably." The New Paleographical Society notes that it "varies a great deal, but is at best a carelessly formed cursive type of script." 19 Confusion of minims in m, n, i , and u was inevitable in any hand of the period and in Thornton's case may also include w -errors; although it was quite different in form, he tended to use w interchangeably with u , especially in the ou digraph. The grapheme &lt;y&gt; is also ambiguous, standing for both y and þ, but it is nevertheless seldom confusing since it is ordinarily clearly distinguishable by context and position. With the meaning þ it occurs with few exceptions only initially or (when medial) before a suspension (e.g., þow 'thou,' o þer 'other'); 20 with the meaning y (i.e., /i/) it is normally used only medially or finally (again with a few unambiguous exceptions, e.g., ynowe 'enough'). The scribe of Thornton's copy appears to have been less careful in distinguishing y and þ by position, however, and a few cases of medial þ without a following suspension do crop up. Thornton never uses &lt;y&gt; for /j/, preferring &lt;3&gt; for that sound in all positions (thus &lt;yow&gt; is always "thou," while "you" is spelled &lt;30w&gt;). That this sound was spelled earlier in the tradition of this text with a thorn-like y , however, is shown by the uncorrected form 30fe for þofe in lines 1938 and 2854. 21 Other closely related letter-forms are f /long s, c/t , and o/e . So alike in form are c and t , in fact, that it is often difficult to decipher which letter the scribe himself intended. 22 Beyond these easily confused forms, there are other pairs that are similar enough to cause occasional confusion, especially if carelessly made: y/r , h/b , initial v/d , final e /sigma s , and gg/w or dd/w . One final peculiarity of letter-form may be noted: like other northern scribes, Thornton often used 3 to indicate a final sibilant (here transcribed as z ); otherwise, he normally chose the sigma-form of s finally, long s initially or medially. The scribe used standard suspension-symbols for -er , -es , -ur , -us , and nasals; the nasal suspension occurs (at times superfluously) in a variety of forms, straight, curved, or looped, sometimes dotted and sometimes not. One must note also Thornton's often-remarked habit of adding apparently superfluous flourishes to final nasals and of crossing doubled ll and (less frequently) th . Although early editors interpreted these marks as suspensions for a following -e , the more recent consensus is that they are usually meaningless. 23 Final -e after d or g was, however, indicated by a superscript dagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Corrections Thornton used three methods to correct his transcription of the poem: first, he might strike out a word or part of a word and (if the error was not simple dittography) immediately thereafter write the preferred form. Second, he might superimpose a preferred letter over a rejected letter in spelling corrections (this habit has led to some problems of legibility) or, in a few cases, convert one letter to another (e.g., r to y ). These two methods were obviously part of the immediate process of transcription; the third method, in which corrections were inserted above or at the end of the completed line, may indicate either an immediate review of each completed line or a later proofreading effort. When this method was used for omitted words, the point of omission was marked by short double virgules or the more familiar angled caret-mark slightly below the line, the mark repeated under the word to be inserted (if at the end of the line). Caret marks (in either form) were also used for word- or spelling-changes by the insertion method. Two of these end-of-line corrections, the insertion of ayer in line 455 and the correction of lordez to londes in line 878, were performed in a hand different from that of the text—one more carefully formed, with letters more uniform in size, and with book rather than cursive e . The text contains no corrections of large-scale error such as omitted or repeated whole lines or garbled passages; presumably if the scribe did recognize and decide to correct such errors he recopied the page. One may infer from the size of his two volumes that he had access to a good supply of paper. In the following summary, Thornton's self-corrections are divided into two major categories, spelling-changes and word-changes. Within these broad categories items are further subdivided into corrected omissions (in which the scribe has added a letter or word), corrected intrusions (in which he has deleted a letter or word), and alterations (in which he has exchanged one letter or word for another). Within these subcategories, further subdivisions emphasize particular tendencies. A third major category then summarizes corrections involving possible suspension errors. Since this system of classification relies on greater certainty about the actual nature or cause of the error corrected than is sometimes available, a number of items are included in more than one category or subcategory (indeed, a few items show multiple correction); the final "Statistical Summary," however, counts each item only once. All examples below are cited from the MS without emendation; Thornton's somewhat erratic capitalization is preserved, except that all line-initial letters are presented as capitals; long i is presented as j except when capitalized as I ; y and þ are distinguished; all suspensions are expanded in italics. Although all items are cited from the MS, they are identified for ease of reference by the editions' line numbers rather than by folio. All available editions include notation of folio pages for those who wish to refer to the facsimile. It should be noted, however, that some of these corrections were made in very light ink; for this and other reasons, some corrections may not be visible in the facsimile. For the examples also, an attempt is made to indicate the method of correction used by the scribe. When a single (right-hand) bracket is used, the element to the left of the bracket was crossed out and the element after inserted, either immediately, above the line, or at the end of the line (the last indicated by an asterisk *). When double brackets include two letters joined by an arrow, the second letter was superimposed over the first (e.g., [r→y]). Double brackets including single elements, in the case of corrected omissions contain inserted material, and in the case of corrected intrusions contain deleted material. I. Spelling changes A. Spelling errors by omission of a letter or letters (77 cases). 1. Consonant omissions or omissions from consonant clusters (37 cases). Examples; el] Erledoms 42; child[r→y]ren 3208; filnesql filsnez 881; ch] schotte 2467; vescowte] vescownte 1984; schok[e→k]e 4114. Of these errors, thirteen involve omitted liquids (10 r , 3 l ); four, the /š/ phoneme; four, omitted nasals; and seven, failure to double consonants after short or lax vowels. 2. Omitted vowels (25 cases). Examples: kenly] kenely 1243; berynge] beryenge 2377; br] burneste 3846; malez] maylez 1857; chanse] chawnse 2368. Of these, four involve metathesis of liquids; six, the ai/ei digraph; nine, the au/ou/eu digraphs. 3. Omitted syllables (9 cases). Examples: wyrp] wyrscheppez 1059; peste] potestate 2327; wre] wandrethe 2370. 4. Preterites and participles (6 cases). Example: regnd] regnede 2034. Like the example, most involve the omission of an inflection-vowel. B. Spelling errors involving intrusive letters (44 cases). 1. Dittography or contamination (19 cases). Examples: swether[w]yke 47 (correction in light ink); Wa[y→w]ayne 1302; hawrawde] harawde 3029; Etten] Eten 'eaten' 2716. Of these, five involve doubled consonants after long or tense vowels. 2. Other intrusive letters (11 cases). Examples: swyche] syche* 76; charye] chare* 1886; togers] Toges 3189; browndys] brondis 3695. 3. False starts (14 cases). Examples: aye] ayers 1259; ti( er? )] title 2363; sha] hade 2472; s] sette 4043. C. Spelling errors involving the exchange of letters (108 cases). 1. Hesitations between possible variant spellings (76 cases). a) e/y hesitations in unstressed syllables (18 cases). Examples: ned[e→y]s 470; capteefes] captyfis 2340; brawnd[e→y]sche 3359; h[e→y]s 384, 3572. Four of these involve unstressed function words like the last example above. Of the total, all but three change e to i/y . b) e/y hesitations in stressed syllables (19 cases). Examples: l[e→y]gmane 420; re] ryuer 920; f[e→y]ste 2233; r[e→y]alle 3373; th[e→y]then 4345. Again, the scribe's alterations consistently prefer i/y to e. Some of these changes may reflect etymological variants ("liege," "royal"); a substantial proportion of the rest involve open-syllable phonological change, but four cases are closed-syllable. c) Special cases: "high" (6 cases), "through" (2 cases), "eyes" (2 cases), "rescue" (3 cases). Examples: h[e→y]e 620; th[o→r]ughe 1857; eyne] eghne 2962; bowez] bowghez 921; resch] rescows 4137. d) Others: a/e/ai respellings (6 cases), e.g., heþe] haythen 2974, 3arnes] 3ermys 3911, aventall] aventaile 2572; o/u/w respellings (7 cases), e.g., auke] awke* 13, co] cu n vayede 482, trouthe] trowthe 2585; consonantal respellings (11 cases), e.g., seluen] selfen 1210, wynnez] wynes 1028, j] gesserawnte 2892, lik] lygham 3281, schragkys] schragges 3473. 2. Misreadings and other errors (32 cases). a) Misread letter-forms: e/o , e.g., be] bot 4070; e /sigma -s , e. g., Romayn[e→s] 2234; f /long s , e.g., f] syghte (with sigma -s ) 1949; h/b , e.g., he] be 3190; n/u , e.g., 30w] 3one 2726; y/r , e.g., Eyrthe] erthe 527; y/þ , e.g., no yng] nothyng e 2442. b) Contamination: e.g., Raylide with reche[d→s] 3263 (the sigma -s does not obscure the d , leading to editions' misreading). c) Transliteration or metathesis: e.g., ffor] fro 1698 (plus two other line-initial cases); ax] aske 2350; many] man 'main' 4071 ( y erased). d) Verb forms: e.g., likyde] lykes 140, sai[d→s] 868. e) Others: r/l , i.e., her] helpe 346, war] walkes 946; u/y (one example), th[u→y] 4323 (perhaps confusion of þ u and þ i ); anomaly, schikf] skilfull 1561. II. Whole-word changes (111 cases). A. Omitted words. 1. In stress position (25 cases). Examples: That Caerlyon was [callid]* : w i t h curius walles 61; The [redyes them stricken ] romaynes redyes þan 1427. 2. In unstress position (28 cases). Examples: to [þ a t] alde wyf 986b; I witter þe [þe]* Emp erour 1239a; Gawayne the gude : [ha stricken ] he has 3706. B. Intrusions (22 cases). Examples: j not [watte] watte it ment 977; sir Ewayne [ sir ] fytz vriene (in light ink) 2066; lady[ne] : ne 3081 (the dele marks read as long -ss- by the editions). Almost all cases in this category are simple dittography errors. C. Word exchanges (36 cases). Examples: hyghe] lowde 124; þe] 30w 225 (in light ink); knyghtez] kynges 523; hono ure ] one 704; treson of lordez] lōnmacrdes 878; Enamellede] ennelled 1294; spourres] speres 2542; full] so 2571; neuen] mene 2869. Among these, we might note three cases of "knights/kings" confusion (523, 3687, 4169), all at line-end. Including these, more than a dozen cases apparently involve confusion of alliterative formulas, especially at line-end. III. Suspensions. Of the examples collected in parts I and II, 20 may have involved confusion of nasal suspensions; for example the correction luppe ] lumppe ] 1814 (I.A.1) may reflect the exemplar's lūppe ; the correction chanse ] chawnse 2368 (I.A.2), the exemplar's chāūse . Two additional corrections also reflect hesitation over nasal spellings: hemmes ] hēmmacres 3253 and reng ] rēgmacrne 4005. Six of the corrections discussed above may have involved the -er suspension, and there are in addition two cases in which a superfluous -er suspension was cancelled (e.g., cou er erde] couerde 3633). Six further cases may have involved the -ur suspension, one the -us , and two general contractions (e.g., peste] potestate 2327, I.A.3). An interesting case is the word-exchange honoure ] one 704 (II.B); since the upper limb of the 7-shaped -ur suspension was horizontal, it could be confused with the nasal suspension, and one may infer that the exemplar had onmacre , first interpreted by the scribe as on ur e . Statistical Summary This survey has dealt with 339 cases of corrected error: 229 spelling changes (including suspensions) and 110 word changes (additions, deletions, and alterations); these counts avoid duplication and may differ from those above. These corrections are distributed fairly evenly throughout the text; the only striking imbalance is in word-additions and -deletions, which occur twice as often in the first half of the text (1-2199) as in the second (2200-4346). Following is a tabulation of corrected errors by position in the alliterative long line; it shows some interesting patterns. In this analysis, A is the first stave, B the second, C the third, and D the fourth, while unstressed words are marked x . In the two or three cases of triple first half-lines (i.e., a a a : a x ), the words are identified as A or B according to the principal stresses in the half-line. The x- positions, of course, may include more than one word; although six cases are identified of word-omissions before the first stave, in no case was an initial word omitted. Statistical Summary Correction Types x A x B x : x C x D x Totals I. Spelling Changes A. Additions 1 15 0 22 0 : 0 24 0 13 1 76 B. Deletions 3 8 3 10 2 : 0 7 1 10 0 44 C.

Even such function words as wyll (2664) and also (3485) are in stress-position. The middle staves, B and C , appear slightly more liable to this kind of spelling error (omission of letters) than A or D . Line IC, spelling changes by alteration, shows that such corrections occur more than twice as often in the first half-line as in the second, an imbalance particularly noticeable in dialectal hesitations. It may be that Thornton was simply more likely to make such changes in the first half-line, rather than that the first half-line was more liable to error. Line ID includes only those suspension-errors in section III that are not included in other sections. Line IIA, additions of omitted words, shows that omissions are over three times as likely to occur in the first half-line as in the second. For unstressed words, the position between A and B is particularly vulnerable; for stressed words, the B- stave. The tabulation for deletion of intrusive words in line IIB is somewhat misleading, for there are five cases of cross-caesura contamination—three in which an A or B stave is repeated at C , two in which an unstressed word occurring immediately after the caesura is prematurely inserted (that is, the caesura is misplaced). Line IIC, corrections of mistaken words, shows that such errors are three times as likely to occur in the second half-line as in the first; in particular, the number of corrections in the fourth stave ( D ) is striking. Nevertheless, for unstressed words the position between A and B again shows the highest number of corrections. The three line-initial for/fro metathesis errors, already tabulated in line IC, are included in parentheses here but are not counted in the totals. Of the long line as a whole, the first half has a slight preponderance of corrected error (58%), with its second part particularly vulnerable. And a stressed word is over three times as likely to show an error of some kind as an unstressed word. Yet the highest incidence of whole-word errors occurs in the vulnerable unstressed position between the first and second stave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusions The Text of Morte Arthure : Direct Evidence The examination of the scribe's corrections provides certain kinds of direct evidence unnoticed by previous editors of the poem. The most obvious kind of direct evidence is the corrections that have simply been overlooked, because they were made in light ink, because a caret-mark was misplaced, or because the scribe's habit of correction by superimposition has misled the transcriber. Lighter-ink corrections previously missed include these: the second w cancelled in Swetherwyke (47; MS reading Swetheryke ); þe crossed out, 30w inserted after it above the line (225)—thus there is no need to emend to 30w þe , for the MS reading is simply 30w ; the second sir- contraction in s ir Ewayne s ir fytz vriene (2066). A special case is the scribe's correction of ladyne (3081), a misdivision that also violates the caesura; the two diagonal slashes with which he crossed out ne look rather like doubled long ss , and a portion of the e remains visible, leading to the editions' reading of ladysse (the MS reading is lady ). Then, editors have felt the need to defend their transposition of his in (1797), 24 not recognizing that the misplacement of his is no more than a misplaced caret-mark in the correction of an omitted word. Examples of misleading corrections by superimposition are ryuere for reuere (424; here the y does not quite overlap the e , leading to the editions' reading reyuere ); hyghe for heghe (2651; not heyghe ); reches for reched (3263; see above, I.C.2.b); leders for ledars (3832). A second kind of evidence comprises clues to the exemplar's form obscured by incomplete corrections. An example is the scribe's failure 25 to complete his task in correcting treson of lordez (878; see II.C above). The error was one of transposition, not entirely corrected by the change of lordez to londes ; the original phrase occurs in line 991, treso ur of landez (with Thornton's Northumbrian a replacing the Midland o of the line 878 correction). As another example, the scribe's omission of romaynes in line 1427 (II.A.1) was corrected by the deletion of the premature redyes them , a phrase retranscribed after the insertion as redyes þan; the emendation of þan to them thus needs no defense. In line 4071, the partial correction of the transliteration many by the erasure of y justifies the emendation of the resultant man to mayn 'main.' Finally, the correction of togers to Toges in line 3189 justifies a similar correction of the togers of line 178. A third kind of evidence from corrected errors is the confirmation of questioned readings. Filsnez (881) was queried by some early commentators before the OED identified this unusual form's ON root; that the scribe questioned it too and confirmed it from his exemplar is demonstrated by his correction of the error filne . 26 A similar case is the scribe's line-end correction of charye to chare (1886); although the word is difficult (the MED's treatment, s.v., is conjectural), emendation to carye or care would be precipitous. 27 On the other hand, the form valewnce (2047) has not previously been questioned; editors have interpreted the word as "Valence," a place name (cf. valence , line 41). But the scribe rejected his first spelling valence in this line, presumably respelling the word from his copy-text; the original reading here may be valewe or even valiaunce (the exemplar's form was possibly valeunce ). Finally, in view of the scribe's correction of forssy to forsesy in line 3300, should one emend the result to forsy (as Krishna does), when the correction seems to insist on this odd spelling?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indirect Evidence Before we come to Thornton's own scribal characteristics, it is worth looking at the evidence the corrections give us for the characteristics of his copy-text for this poem. 28 We can infer from the errors and their corrections that the hand of the previous scribe was a similar cursive script, at least by the evidence of o/e confusion (these graphemes are less likely to be mistaken in book hand). Besides the universal scribal problems of minims ( m , n , u , i ), c/t , and f /long s , the exemplar also had similar pairs h/b , r/y , e/o , e /sigma s , and identical y/þ . Moreover, the copy-text seems to have used similar suspensions and to have made similar suspension-errors—in particular, to have been similarly careless about nasal suspensions. On the other hand, Thornton's preference for w- spellings of the au/ou digraphs seems not to have been shared with his predecessor, a fact which may increase the likelihood of u/n error. The previous scribe also appears to have been more willing to use þ medially without a following suspension; the spellings heþen ( e ) (3687, 3704) and seþen (1977) are probably his. Dialectal characteristics suggest that other corrected forms taken from the exemplar include beryenge (2377; I.A.2 above), wenge corrected from wyenge (4002), and—a special case—both the error swyche and its correction syche (76; I.B.2 above). 29 Finally, although the conclusion is not based on Thornton's self-corrections, there is some evidence that the previous scribe's hand was uneven, as in the uncorrected error Cyr us witrye for cyrqwitrye (2616), in which the q had apparently crept far enough above the line to be misread as the -us suspension. Thus, when speaking of the scribal tendencies in Thornton's copy of Morte Arthure, one should keep in mind that many of them were shared with his immediate predecessor (as well as late medieval scribes more generally). Nevertheless, one may legitimately infer from the foregoing analysis certain habitual procedures on the part of Robert Thornton. The broadest conclusion one may draw is that Thornton transcribed, not word by word, but line by line. This conclusion is based primarily on the patterns of error shown in the "statistical summary," especially the greater tendency for the omission of words in the first half-line and the greater tendency for the wrong word to be copied in the second half-line, especially the last stave. What these patterns appear to show is a scribe hurrying through the first half-line in his writing in an attempt to complete the line while his memory of the whole was fresh—but not always succeeding. The tendency to mistake the final stave would be aggravated, of course, by the poet's frequent dependence on almost interchangeable formulaic tags in the second half-line; as mentioned earlier (II.C above), a number of these errors can be attributed to Thornton's confusion of tags. 30 An additional factor is the normal absence of alliteration in the final stave. While transcribing the line, Thornton frequently performed his corrections in the process of writing, by superimposing a preferred letter or by crossing out and adding the correct (or an omitted) form immediately; many of these corrections may have been made without rechecking to copy. Twenty-five or so of the corrections, however, were performed after the transcription of the line was completed, for they were inserted at the end of the line with the deleted error or a caret-mark or both indicating the appropriate place. Among these, of course, are the two corrections by the second hand mentioned earlier. We can see the scribe, in summary, reading a line in his exemplar and committing it to short-term memory, transcribing it with immediate corrections, occasionally checking the exemplar in the process, and then briefly rechecking it before going on to the next line. That brief look back, of course, while it helped him to correct error, may also have helped to introduce new error in the form of contamination from neighboring lines. One cannot claim that the scribe's attention to correctness in transcription was always at a high pitch, or that he always rechecked the exemplar before going on, in any case. There are too many errors remaining in the text, and Thornton undoubtedly committed his share of these.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scribe's Tendencies to Error We may first take up spelling elements that appear to have caused particular problems for the scribe. The problem of nasals (22 errors) should occasion no surprise, since the ambiguity of minim-graphemes and the availability of alternative means of representation (i.e., suspensions) must inevitably have caused confusion. Four of these corrections, however, may show some uncertainty about the distinction between the alveolar and velar nasals (nayknmacrgmacr] nakyn 2350, rynge] ryngne 3214, lenghne] lenghe 3265, reng] regne 4005). 31 Problems with liquids (24 errors, including omission, metathesis, and r/l exchange) were perhaps more closely related to speech patterns, in view of the importance of auditory memory in scribal habits. 32 Among other consonants, although only four corrections involve ch/sch spellings (bewch] bewschers 1047, basche] basschede 2121, ch] schotte 2467, Iriche] Irische 4123), in the text as a whole the scribe frequently hesitated over such forms (cf. charpe 3600 vs. scharpe 3842, ravichse 3539); it is difficult to know whether the ch spellings were the scribe's or his exemplar's. 33 Other consonantal respellings appear to be related to adjacent vowels: in fact, Thornton seems to have had some difficulty spelling for vowel length, with five corrections of single consonants after short vowels, five corrections of doubled consonants after long vowels, and two corrected omissions of lengthening-vowels (kenly] kenely 1243, knes] kneys 4274). 34 Turning to vowel problems, we find nine cases of hesitation in the spelling of the ai/ei diphthong, usually resolved in favor of the exemplar against the late ME tendency to level the diphthong in unstressed syllables (Jordan, §247) and perhaps the tendency in parts of Scotland and Yorkshire to level it in stressed syllables (§§132, 233 Rem. 2). The situation with o/u/ou hesitations is a little more complicated. Six corrections simply show the scribe's preference for w- spellings where u might be ambiguous; but six other ou/ow spellings correct initial errors in u or o (four in tonic syllables, two in atonic). The one or two a/au hesitations may also reflect leveling of a diphthong, of which there is some evidence elsewhere in the text, though au forms predominate (see Jordan, §§240, 287). Most striking among the vowel-changes are the large number involving e and i/y . In the fourteen cases of e/y change in unstressed syllables, the scribe's preference for i/y spellings (in four verb inflections and four noun plurals, among other forms) is predictable for his own northern dialect (Jordan, §135); but in the text as a whole he by no means converted all such unstressed e 's, inflectional or otherwise, to y 's or i 's. 35 Indeed, the twice-repeated correction of hes to hys (384, 3572) rejects a peculiarly northern form (see MED, s.v. "his" pron. [1]) that appears nowhere else in the poem. Although the e/y changes in stressed syllables also show a consistent preference for i/y spellings, the dialectal evidence is harder to interpret. On the one hand, nine of the rejected forms (e.g., reuer , menystre , etc.) show the Northern lowering and lengthening of i to /e:/ in an open syllable (Jordan, §§36, 226), reversed by the scribe in his corrections; such spellings do occur elsewhere in the text, however. Four of the rejected forms, on the other hand, show e spellings in closed syllables (e.g., fefty , messe-do ), corrected by the scribe to y ; if the rejected forms reflect a later ME lowering of i to e in closed syllables south of Humber (Jordan, §§36, 271), they presumably were found in the copy. I have found little evidence of such lowering in other Thornton texts, and in Morte Arthure there remain only scheftez , en (2456, 3627), and possibly one or two others. 36 Treatment of other dialectal forms seems to be similarly inconsistent. Though the two corrections for the word "eyes" ( eghne 2962, eyghen 3985) seem to reflect Thornton's own preference—the -gh- form predominates not only in this but in other Thornton texts 37 —several of the corrections for "high" reinstate the exemplar's form hye (e.g., 620, 1646). A good example of the scribe's dialectal indecisiveness is the corrected form childyren (3208, corrected from an initial childr- ), a kind of compromise between the northern childir , -er and the more southerly children (the northern form dominates in this text three to one). To sum up, although a number of spelling changes show a predictable preference for the spellings of the scribe's own dialect, not all of them do so, by any means. Indeed, the changes he makes are surprisingly limited; there is little evidence in the corrections, for example, of o &gt; a change (in forms either from OE ā or OE a plus a lengthening group), yet both o and a forms are found uncorrected in the text. 38 The largest group of dialectal vowel-changes, in fact, is that involving e &gt; i/y correction, and as we have seen the dialectal direction of these changes is mixed. It seems probable that the large number of e/i/y changes among these corrections reflects the scribe's own uncertainty in view of the phonological changes occurring in this and other dialects at this period; some spelling decisions elsewhere in the text, for example, appear to have been influenced by the raising of long tense e (e.g., bieldez 'dwell' 1242, chiftayne 2732) and the lowering and diphthongizing of long tense i (e.g., weysse 'wise' 2514, theyn 'thine' 3403; see Jordan, §§277, 279). These and certain other phonological changes must have complicated the scribe's choices considerably. The evidence of other dialectal spelling changes is also inconsistent, however; yet Thornton's basically conservative approach is shown by such corrections as that of thys to thes rather than thir "these" (52), and that of swyche to syche (76), apparently reproducing his copy's own correction (see note 29 above). One must also take some note of spelling changes that may be attributed to common scribal errors, often described elsewhere: dittography, contamination, transliteration, confusion of similar letter-forms, and particularly suspension-error. Thornton also shared with other scribes, amateur and professional, the tendency towards overleaping of phrases, words, and parts of words, and towards carelessness with familiar literary formulas. But there is little evidence in these self-corrections of deliberate changes in the directions Kane ( Piers Plowman , pp. 125-128) pointed out of the more explicit, "correct," intelligible, emphatic, or elegant statement. It is possible, of course, that at least some of Thornton's word-alterations reflect his judgment of appropriateness rather than his review of the copy-text; for example, the substitution of hym for he in line 2227 may be an attempt to clarify a somewhat confusing encounter between the Emperor Lucius and sir Lionel in battle—but even with the substitution it is still not clear who struck whom in this line. On the other hand, the evidence of such corrections as jrrtayne (575), valewnce (2047), chare (1886), and filsnez (881), words which were obviously unfamiliar to the scribe, argues the priority of fidelity over intelligibility in his eyes. Finally, we may identify certain patterns of error. Certainly in this work, probably in other alliterative texts from Thornton, perhaps in alliterative texts from other hands, one is more likely to find: 1. Omitted letters in staves than in unstressed words; 2. Omitted words (stressed and unstressed) in the first half-line than in the second; 3. Respellings in the first than in the second half-line, and in staves than in unstressed words; 4. Wrong staves in the second half-line than in the first, and especially in the D position. And as a broad generalization, one may say that, at least in Thornton's hands, the weakest part of the alliterative long line—the part most subject to error—is the latter part of the first half-line, the B- stave and the unstressed word or words that precede it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Applications The real usefulness of this kind of analysis will perhaps become apparent only when its conclusions are applied in the evaluation of uncorrected error in the text under study. 39 One hardly needs, after all, to know that the scribe had corrected a certain number of transliteration errors to emend fonode (205) to foonde , swrede (47) to swerde . But, on the other hand, familiarity with the scribe's problems with the ai/ei diphthong—the errors he corrected tend to show the omission of one or the other vowel-element—may cast some light on a form like wye 'weigh' (740), which occurs as the C- stave in its line, a position in which Thornton corrected some twenty-four letter-omissions. Thus, although the OED records this spelling as a Scots and Northern variant of the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries (citing only this instance, however), the emendation weye is fully justified by the patterns of error shown in Thornton's self-corrections. The greatest benefit available from the study of the scribe's self-corrections, in short, is simply familiarity with the scribe's habits of mind and pen. Familiarity of this kind allows the editor to focus more clearly on the causes and kinds of error in the text he must deal with and to deal with them on a more rational basis.</field>

This hand is found in only one other place in the MS, in the explicit of "The Preuite off the Passioune" and incipit of the "Tractatus Willelmi Nassyngton" on fol. 189. I would like to express my obligation to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral for allowing me to study the MS at length some years ago (before it was rebound), and to the staff of the Lincolnshire Archives Office, The Castle, Lincoln, for providing facilities and helpful advice. 2 See H. J. Chaytor, From Script to Print (1967), pp. 5-21. 3 See George Kane, ed., Piers Plowman: The A Version (1960), pp. 141-142. 4 The text's alliterative irregularities led early commentators to propose an extraordinary number of emendations to increase alliteration. The edition of Erik Björkman ( Morte Arthure [Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1915]) conveniently summarizes these proposals and puts many of them to use. The problem was clarified by J.L.N. O'Loughlin, "The Middle English Alliterative Morte Arthure ," M Æ , 4 (1935), 153-168, who showed that the poet's use of alliteratively grouped lines allowed him divergences from regular patterns in individual lines. 5 The scribe's identity was established by Margaret Ogden in her edition of the Thornton Liber de Diversis Medicinis , EETS 207 (1938), pp. x-xvii.

Keiser's search through Yorkshire wills of the period (pp. 165-177) demonstrates the regional availability of many of Thornton's texts, particularly the religious ones, among families of similar social status or clerics. But clearly Thornton must have had to spread his net wide to gain access to them. 8 Stern, pp. 210, 213-214, and A. S. G.

McIntosh cites here his earlier article, "The Textual Transmission of the Alliterative Morte Arthure ," in English and Medieval Studies Presented to J. R. R. Tolkien , ed. Norman Davis and C. E. Wrenn (1962), pp. 231-240. In the article on Morte Arthure (hereinafter "Transmission"), McIntosh identifies two previous dialectal stages of transmission: a scribe (M1) whom he localizes in "southwest Lincolnshire . . . somewhere between Sleaford and Grantham" (p. 233), who was also responsible for Thornton's text of The Preuite of the Passioune ; and M1's source for the poem (M2), localized in "Lindsey rather than Kesteven," in "the general neighbourhood of Louth" (p. 237). For each previous stage (M1 and M2), McIntosh cites a few characteristic forms or spellings that will figure later in this study. 12 For upties 'ropes or chains by which yards are suspended,' see OED, s.v. "uptie" sb. Naut. The error vpcynes is a simple one, involving c/t confusion and a mistaken nasal suspension. Bilynge is more difficult; the emendation to bilyge was first proposed by Mary M. Banks, "Notes on the 'Morte Arthure' Glossary," MLQ , 6 (1903), 64-65, and adopted by the most recent editor, Valerie Krishna, The Alliterative Morte Arthure (1976). See OED, s.v. "bilge" sb.; although bilge is described as "a corruption of bulge (OF boulge )" the earliest citation of "bulge" in the nautical sense is 1622, while the earliest besides this for "bilge" is 1513 (in Douglas' Aeneis ). See also Bertil Sandahl, Middle English Sea Terms , I , Essays and Studies on English Language and Literature 8 (Uppsala, 1951), pp. 28-29. 13 An example is tachesesede for tatterede (821), an error which may have resulted partly from unevenness in the lines of the scribe's copy-text (see comment on cyr us witrye 2616 below); the unevenness may have lifted the long r far enough above its context to create a puzzle for the scribe, who resolved its down and up strokes as a doubled long ss. The - ses - spelling is reflected elsewhere in the text: cf. Thornton's correction of forssy to forsesy 3300. 14 See Stern, pp. 201-214, for an analysis of the variation in script size and evenness which supports the conclusion that only one scribe was responsible for the London MS. 15 Stern, however, briefly surveys self-corrections in the London MS, reaching the conclusion that Thornton generally tended to reinstate copy-text form (pp. 33-37). 16 George Kane has identified these five tendencies as being characteristic of fifteenth-century scribes, Piers Plowman , pp. 126-128. 17 Primary dependence in this study has been on Eugene J. Crook's updated translation of Richard Jordan's 1934 Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: Richard Jordan's Handbook of Middle English Grammar: Phonology , trans. and rev. Eugene J. Crook (1974). Also useful (although the evidence is a little early for this text) is Gillis Kristensson, A Survey of Middle English Dialects 1290-1350: The Six Northern Counties and Lincolnshire , Lund Studies in English 35 (1967). 18 See Ogden, Liber , pp. xxviii-xxxi, for a brief discussion of the language of this text. 19 Facsimiles of Ancient Manuscripts , Series 2 (1913), Plate 45. 20 On the possibility that the &lt;th&gt; and &lt;þ&gt; graphemes came to be used to symbolize the voiceless and voiced consonants respectively, see A. J. Bliss, "The Spelling of Sir Launfal ," Anglia , 75 (1957), 275-289. See also Crook, Richard Jordan's Handbook , p. 203 (hereinafter "Jordan"). 21 McIntosh identifies the 30fe form as belonging to stage M2, the Lindsey scribe: "Transmission," p. 236. See also OED, s.v. "Y." 22 The edition of Valerie Krishna has a number of c/t transcription errors that demonstrate this difficulty. 23 According to the New Paleographical Society, "It is doubtful whether fifteenth-century scribes attached any definite meaning to [such flourishes], though e is doubtless sometimes correct," Facsimiles , 45. M.B. Parkes calls them "otiose strokes" in English Cursive Book Hands 1250-1500 (1969), pp. xxix-xx. See also Offord, Parlement , p. xiii. 24 See, for example, Krishna's note to line 1797 in her edition, p. 183. 25 Or perhaps his overlooker's; this is one of the two corrections in a hand different from that of the text. 26 The ON root was actually first identified by Edmund Brock in the glossary of his edition of the poem, Morte Arthure , EETS 8 (1871); Franz Mennicken's emendation-proposal ("Versbau und Sprache in Huchown's Morte Arthure," Bonner Beiträge zur Anglistik , Heft 5 [Bonn, 1900], p. 141), as Banks said, "does not help" ("Notes on Glossary," p. 65). 27 See Mennicken, p. 110, and Banks, p. 65. This is the first of two lines alliterating on /k/, and alliterative regularity is the real basis of Mennicken's emendation-proposal. I would conjecture that chare(n) v. is related to char n. 'a hearse' (see MED, s.v. "char" n. [2], sense 1d) as carte(n) v. 'to load (sthg.) in a cart' is to cart n. (see MED, s.vv.). 28 See McIntosh, "Transmission," p. 233, on the dialectal characteristics of the copytext's scribe (M1). 29 According to McIntosh, the syche form is characteristic of Thornton's copy (M1), while the swyche form belongs to the next previous stage of transmission (M2): "Transmission," pp. 233n., 236. The corrected form is an end-of-line insertion in the MS, and may have been the same in M1—that is, Thornton very likely reproduced here his predecessor's correction. The -enge form of the verbal, as in the corrected form beryenge , is also identified by McIntosh with Scribe M1 (p. 233n.). The corrected form wenge (from the error wyenge , 4002) is also ascribed to Thornton's exemplar because the vowel in this Scandinavian loanword (ON vœngr ) was raised to i earlier in more northerly texts (Jordan, §34). The -e- spelling prevails elsewhere in this text. 30 See Robert J. Gates, ed., The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyne (1969), pp. 46-49, on the problem of "formulaic variants" in that text. 31 At least, nakyng , a possible inverse spelling, may testify to the late ME fronting of /η/ to /n/ in unstressed syllables (Jordan, §175). 32 It may be worth remarking that three of the omitted r 's are in positions in which, in more southerly dialects than Thornton's, r had a tendency to assimilate with a following s or dental (Jordan, §§166, 302). See also Archibald A. Hill, "Early Loss of [r] before Dentals," PMLA , 55 (1940), 308-359. 33 According to Jordan and Crook, such ch spellings reflect the phonological change from /&amp;c.aron;/ to /š/ in French words spelled with this digraph (§§17, 181, 257 Rem. 4). Perhaps relevant is McIntosh's finding that the spelling cho for "she" had a limited range, the occurrence of which in MA he attributes to scribe M1 ("Transmission," p. 233n.). 34 Thornton's use of the Northern sign of length in kneys is unique among the corrections. Elsewhere the text has knees(s) , and one may suppose that the exemplar had knes at this point. 35 According to Kristensson, i/y spellings in unstressed syllables of place-names are "well attested" in the North Riding in the earlier 14th century but "practically negligible" in Lincolnshire in the same period (although they do occur). "It should however be noted that in all the counties examined forms in [e] by far outnumber those in [i]" ( Survey , pp. 186-187). I nevertheless assume in this discussion that i/y spellings would have been Thornton's preference, that e- spellings were more likely his exemplar's. 36 I have been unable to find any other unequivocally closed-syllable examples in several hours of determined searching. One other Thornton text, the Prose Life of Alexander , however, does record the spelling feftene (14/31). The situation with this sound-change is less clear than with the open-syllable change. R.J. Dobson ( English Pronunciation 1500-1700 , 2nd ed., II [1968], 570-571) records closed-syllable forms with e from the Northern orthoepist Levins (1570): ench , frenge , spet , and resh 'rush.' If the lowering of i to e in closed syllables was indeed a late Northern change rather than an earlier Midlands and Southern one, then these corrections agree with the first group in restoring copy spellings against the scribe's own. Nevertheless, during the fifteenth century such spellings were far more likely to be found in Midland texts such as the Paston Letters; see Jordan, §271, for examples. 37 Eyne occurs only once (3282) and is presumably the exemplar's form; eghne is preferred in other Thornton texts, including the "Medical Book." 38 Not all a- spellings in the text are necessarily Thornton's. Kristensson's analysis of northern place-names in the early 14th century shows that the southeasternmost boundary of OE ā &gt; a and OE a + lengthening group &gt; a was the Witham rather than the Humber River ( Survey , pp. 30-32 and Maps 9 and 17). Thus the dialect of Scribe M2, the Louth scribe, must have included this feature—though how consistently in an early fifteenth-century text one cannot say. It ought perhaps to be remarked that the scribe's corrections conceal no specifically Northwest Midland forms. S. O. Andrew's argument for a NWM original ("The Dialect of Morte Arthure ," RES , 4 [1928], 418-423) was finally disposed of by McIntosh, "Transmission," pp. 239-240. 39 My conclusions on Morte Arthure will be put to the test in my forthcoming edition of the poem, to be published in the Garland Medieval Texts series, Garland Publishing, Inc.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The "Setting Foorth" of Harington's Ariosto by Simon Cauchi</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just as book design has only recently become established as a specialist craft in which a skilled workman may make a living and be credited for his work, so the historical study of book design is a relatively new field in inquiry, not yet thoroughly incorporated into the conventional wisdom of historical bibliography and of textual and literary criticism. Adrian Wilson is a pioneer in both fields, and his book The Making of the Nuremberg Chronicle (1976) is a remarkable demonstration that book design was practised in a recognizable way in the earliest years of printing—and indeed before—and that evidence of its practice survives. Somewhat similar evidence survives in relation to Harington's Ariosto, 1 which Philip Gaskell has described as "an unusually well-documented example of the progress from writer to reader of a work of literature of the late Elizabethan period". Yet Gaskell in his study of Robert McNulty's critical edition pays hardly any attention to questions of book design, preferring to concentrate his discussion on the transmission of the text and on McNulty's treatment of it. 2 The "text" is understood narrowly as being constituted by the "words" and their "details" (spelling, punctuation, etc.) but such matters as the layout of the words on the page are regarded as "relatively minor" (p. 15) and the fact that, for example, much of Harington's apparatus, like the text of the Nuremberg Chronicle , was "written to fit" the space available for it is not even mentioned. Tom Davis in an article on modern textual editing 3 adopted a similar approach, acknowledging that Harington "specified the typeface and ornaments" (p. 64) of his book, but arguing that his authorial intentions in such matters could be ignored by a modern editor, "since they do not affect what readers would declare to constitute the work" (p. 65). In this article I shall be arguing, on the contrary, that the design of Harington's book (the 1591 edition) did indeed affect the text of his apparatus and does indeed affect—in ways that Harington intended—a reader's understanding and enjoyment of the work as a whole. Harington chose to publish his verse-translation in the form of a fine, elaborately-presented printed book, in which he addressed his readers not only in the verse of his translation and in the verse and prose of his apparatus but also in the ancillary languages of picture and typography. I believe that, if these ancillary languages are interpreted aright, one is led to a new respect for his work as a translator; or, in other words, that his work as a book-designer is an essential part of his achievement in "setting foorth" Ariosto's poem for the reading public of Elizabethan England. Like the poem itself and much of the apparatus, the book's design was largely "filcht from forren lands" 4 —that is to say, the pictures and typography are modelled on Italian originals, notably the Franceschi edition of 1584—but Harington imposed his own treatment on all three elements of the book (poem, apparatus, and design) and did his best to reconcile and integrate the diverse materials he energetically brought together, imitated, adapted, and improvised. The verse-translation was written first, and the length of each of the forty-six cantos seems to have been determined by purely literary constraints (Harington's time, patience, and skill); but there is ample evidence to suggest that the apparatus was shaped to fit the design that Harington had in mind, and that the design itself was shaped to express the form and indeed some of the significances of the work. No doubt it is going a little far to call Harington a "book-designer" in his own right—he was a "print-customer", really—but the term does serve to emphasize two well-known facts: that the printer, Richard Field, took his instructions from Harington in these matters, and that Harington "gaue direction" for the making of the book's engraved title-page and forty-six engraved illustrations. It seems clear that Harington intended the book's design to serve as an expressive means of communication with his readers, modifying as well as reinforcing the verbal meanings of the text. Just how well his intentions were carried out, and just what degree of fidelity to the 1591 design may properly be called for in a modern edition, are interesting questions, which deserve to be looked at quite closely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The materials which enable us to form an assessment of Harington's design-intentions are quite plentiful. First of all, the advertisement to the reader, as D. F. McKenzie has written, 5 is "a remarkably informative statement about the range of reader responses that Harington thinks to elicit" (p. 104). In it, Harington explained "more plainely, then for the learned sort had haply bene requisite" the arrangement of the book, the functions of its component parts (or, rather, most of them, including the illustrations), and how and in what spirit he wished the book to be read. The language is plain and direct, admirably suited to its immediate purpose; yet it abounds, as so many old documents do, and like the rest of Harington's prose in this book, in fascinating half-expressed thoughts, which I shall be attempting to elucidate and amplify. If one reads the text of the advertisement straight through and counts up all the main verbs in the active voice and first person singular, one gains a very clear impression indeed of Harington's close personal involvement in every part of the book. So, too, the wording of its title suggests clearly enough Harington's concern with the book's presentation as well as with its substance: AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER BEFORE | HE READE THIS POEME , OF SOME THINGS TO BE OBSERVED , | as well in the longsublongstance of this worke, as allongso in the longsetting foorth thereof , with the vlongse of the Pictures , | table , and annotations to the longsame annexed . In the 1591 edition, the advertisement occupies one full page (sig. A1) immediately preceding the plate for Book I. Its location there as part of the first regular gathering suggests that it may have been set and printed at or near the beginning of the printing-job, and not as the other preliminaries were at the end of it. This may account for the lack of any mention in it of the general allegory of the whole work and the life of Ariosto, both of which appear at the back of the book, after the poem and before the index, and may well have been late additions to the book's contents—just as most or all of the third part of the preface, the defence of Harington's own work, certainly was. If the general allegory and the life of Ariosto were indeed late additions, then Harington was willing to make a virtue of necessity, for he wrote them in such a way that they suit their location at the back of the book, balancing and complementing the preliminary material, and they are addressed (the first explicitly) to readers "that haue read the former Poeme". However, it is possible they were planned to go there from the beginning, and were not mentioned in the advertisement simply because Harington did not there wish to draw attention to them. More light is shed on Harington's conception of the book's design, and on the chronological sequences of composition, design, and printing, by the two surviving manuscripts, both of which ante-date the printed book. Bodleian MS Rawl. Poet. 125 is a scribal fair copy of the first twenty-four cantos, and is said to look like a "mock-up" for an elaborate edition to be illustrated both by engravings and also by woodcuts deriving from one or more of the Giolito editions. 6 Either that, or else perhaps it preserves two separate attempts at planning, one for woodcut illustrations and one for engravings. The inclusion of a Perseus and Andromeda engraving adapted to serve as an illustration of the Rogero and Angelica episode at the end of Book X shows that Harington at-one stage was considering an alternative plan to the straightforward copying and adaptation of the engravings by Girolamo Porro in the Franceschi edition. British Library MS Add. 18920 is a fair copy of Books XIV-XLVI, mostly in Harington's own hand, and has the special interest of being the manuscript that was used as printer's copy in Field's printing-house. 7 It is from this manuscript that we know of Harington's keen interest in details of the book's layout, ornament, and typography, expressed in what McNulty (p. xlii) called his "peremptory" instructions to Field; and it is by reference to this manuscript—to the layout of the material on the page, to the deletions and revisions and additions, to the printers' signature and page-number notations, to errors in the stanza-numbering, and so on—that many small puzzles about the making of the printed book can be resolved, wholly or in part. Missing from this manuscript are the end-of-canto notes on the moral, the history, the allegory, and the allusion, except those for Books XXVI, XXIX-XXXVII, XXXIX, and XLIV-XLVI, which are present. The presence in the manuscript of some of these end-of-canto notes may possibly be related to Harington's absence or irregular attendance at the printing-house while the book was being printed. Some of those present in the manuscript may have been written early, before Harington went away for a time; but those for Book XXXVI, at least, were written late, after the copy was cast off for the press, for they are written around a deleted signature-notation which is copied out again below. Further information about Harington's design-intentions can be obtained by comparing the 1591 edition with other printed books, and especially with the various Italian editions of Ariosto's poem that served as its design-models. These include not only the 1584 Franceschi edition but also the Valgrisi edition and possibly earlier Italian editions as well. 8 In particular, it is instructive to compare the treatment by the English printers and engravers of these Italian design-models with Harington's treatment of his literary sources for the poem and its apparatus. 9 Reference was made earlier to some doubtful points of chronology. A good deal is clear, however, and before going on to consider the book's design in more detail, it will be worth while sketching out some of the salient facts that can be inferred. The poem itself was the first part of the British Library manuscript to be copied out, with room being left for the addition in single or double column of the verse-arguments; but the fair copy of the verse was not necessarily completed before the earlier cantos were revised, equipped with verse-arguments and marginal notes, and printed. The marginal notes were evidently entered in at various times. They are in handwriting of various sizes and degrees of neatness, now in secretary script, now in italic. Since several have been traced to their sources in Lavezuola's "Osservationi" and Ruscelli's "Annotationi" incorporated in the Franceschi edition, it seems likely that Harington, while using these and perhaps other commentaries, would turn from one place to another in the manuscript to enter his marginal notes. The end-of-canto notes (mostly absent from the manuscript) seem to have been written in sequence, beginning from the beginning; this is observable from the text, for some promises made about them are not fulfilled, or their fulfilment is deferred. 10 From Book IV on, most of them, like Ruscelli's canto-by-canto "Annotationi" in the Valgrisi and Franceschi editions, were written to fit the available space left over at the end of the verse; they usually end neatly at or near the foot of the page. The general allegory was written after the work of annotation was complete, as can be seen from its first paragraph; so also, presumably, was the life of Ariosto. Drafts or early versions of the preface and the index seem to have been in existence at an early stage of the work, although both were printed late. They are both referred to in the advertisement to the reader, somewhat inaccurately, and also in marginal notes and elsewhere. 11 In brief, the text of the work seems to have been composed in a rather complicated chronological sequence. The printers, however, seem to have worked through the book systematically, gathering by gathering, from A to ¶. The sequence of setting within each gathering does not appear to follow a regular pattern. There was no need to keep to one, since most of the text consisted of verse in regular stanzas, easy to cast off accurately. The running-titles never wander further than into an adjacent book or gathering, forward or back. Wrong page-numbers are few and far between, even though there are some lengthy sequences of them in the printer's copy, most but not all subsequently corrected. The major confusion in page-numbering occurs in Book XXIV, after an irregular gathering of four leaves at the end of Book XXIII—about which more later. An interesting improvement in the layout of the canto-openings is first made in Book XIV. These layouts are of three types. Book I, with a lengthier headtitle than the rest, has the first six stanzas on the first page. The remainder have the first seven, the break between columns coming after the first line of the third stanza in Books II-XIII, XV and XXVI, but after the second line of the third stanza (a decided improvement) in Books XIV, XVI-XXV, and XXVII-XLVI. It seems clear that the improvement in layout was made too late for Book XV but in time for Book XIV; or, in other words, that sig. K4 was printed before sig. I5. (The untypical break later on, at Book XXVI, was necessitated by an extra turned-over line, mistakenly indented below the initial in the first stanza.) From Book XIV on, also, and not before, there regularly appear below the notes of allusion such lines as "The end of the Annotations vpon the fourteenth booke". Questions of layout and presentation were evidently reconsidered at this stage of the job, and it may be more than sheer coincidence that, from Book XIV on, the printer's copy has survived—though it is of course not known when the copy for Books I-XIII and the verse-argument for Book XIV was lost. Harington's manuscript direction to Field at the end of the annotations to Book XLVI shows that only then was the type chosen for the preface, general allegory, and life of Ariosto. Pointedly, I think, these were to be—and are—in the same fount of pica roman as Field had used for printing The Arte of English Poesie (1589): "Mr Feeld . . . I would have the allegory (as allso the appollygy and all the prose that ys to come except the table [)] in the same printe that Putnams booke ys." Not only the fount of pica roman but also the initials and ornaments of "Putnams booke" were used again in Harington's. 12 I have been unable to establish whether the sheets regularly went through the rolling press, for the printing of the engravings, before or after the printing of the text; it may or may not be significant that two of the wrong page-numbers, "208" at sig. S3v and "141" at sig. X5, are on the same side of the sheet as engravings. The printers regularly made allowance for these engravings in their casting-off, and in the 1591 edition (unlike the 1607 and 1634 reprints, and for that matter unlike the 1584 Franceschi edition) 13 they are all correctly printed, in their proper places and the right way up. Thus, with only one major exception (the irregular gathering of four leaves at the end of Book XXIII), the work of preparing and printing the book seems to have gone reasonably smoothly, once the methods of annotating and illustrating it had been chosen and devised. The only major alteration in the book's contents made in the course of printing seems to have been the addition of new material at the end of the preface and possibly also at the back of the book. The additions—if that is what they are—were intended principally but not solely to answer and forestall readers' criticisms of the translation, verse, and notes. These last, the end-of-canto notes in particular, seem to have given Harington a good deal of trouble, for in them he "strained" himself not only "to make mention of some of my kindred and frends" (as he wrote in the third part of the preface) but to organize them according to a preconceived fourfold division (moral, history, allegory, and allusion) and at the same time to make them fit neatly on the page. However, the chosen method was applied pretty consistently, and the description Harington gives in the advertisement to the reader of the functions of these end-of-canto notes is quite remarkably accurate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It is time now to consider in more detail the "setting foorth" of the book as it is described in the advertisement to the reader and to try to form an assessment of Harington's authorial intentions in regard to the book's design (illustrations and typography). The first point to be noted is that the "setting foorth" is by no means merely derivative; it is adapted, not copied, from the Franceschi and Valgrisi editions, and has a number of interesting original features. Secondly, even its most conspicuously derivative features—that is to say, the illustrations—were borrowed for an artistic purpose and employed to calculated effect; or so it can be argued. They are examples of " honest Theft ". The first question to be asked concerns Harington's book in relation to his readers. What was Harington's purpose, his authorial intention, in bringing out a book of this kind? On the one hand, it was a translation—and therefore presumably chiefly intended for readers ignorant of Italian; on the other, it was elaborately and expensively produced—and presumably beyond the pockets of many who most had need of it. No record seems to survive of the price at which Harington's Ariosto was sold to the Elizabethan public, but comparable books were sold in the 1590s for more than ten shillings, unbound; and binding would have cost another three or four shillings. 14 Harington recognized that "all that may reade this booke are not of equall capacities" and his translation and notes are accommodated to the needs and wishes of many different readers: the Queen, his "kindred and frends" (and among them especially, perhaps, his wife), 15 the book-trade authorities (no doubt), and others. In particular, many of the more elementary aids to comprehension with which he equipped the poem seem to have been addressed to the less learned readers of his book and here, I believe, he may have been thinking primarily of the needs of children, as well as of the less cultivated readers of the (wealthier) middle class. He appends his life of Ariosto: ". . . to satisfie such as are desirous to know who this Ariosto was, whom I haue so greatly extolled in my Apologie, as a benefactor of all studious mindes, and on whose worke I haue employed so much time, to put it into English verse, and to bestow so many notes as I haue done vpon the expounding of his Allegories, and whatsoeuer else I iudged fit for the readers of weaker capacities." We know that Harington's book was owned by families of the gentry and nobility and read by younger members of them, but just how widely the first edition of 1591 was distributed among the poorer literate classes is uncertain; not widely at all, one imagines. Considering the readership, it is entirely understandable that the ancillary matter with which the poem is accompanied should tend, for all its elaboration, to be comparatively simple and straightforward (though it is graced with many details intended to give pleasure to the more discerning). In the preface, which is clearly intended to be a statement of some weight, Harington undertakes the initial task of introducing the translation to his English readers. He relates the work to the moral and literary concerns and controversies of contemporary English society, deprecating and ridiculing much that seems to him foolish, and dealing at length with the matters that seem to him to present serious threats to the success of his book. These are principally the fears of the pious but less cultivated reader that such "Italian toyes" as Ariosto's poem might be "hurtfull for his soule, or conscience", and the cant of the time that poetry was a "nurse of lies" and an "inticer to wantonnes". Harington defends his work in his own individual way, laying particular stress on the poem's tendency to virtue, the true ground and basic credibility of Ariosto's narrative, and the pleasure as well as the profit to be taken from the poet's delightful fictions. Characteristically, he pokes fun at the hypocrisy of readers who blame and at the same time enjoy the poet's "lasciuious" stories, but for all that he takes the charge of "wantonnes" seriously and does his best to answer it. He has an equally individual point of view on the purely literary side of the question, arguing rather paradoxically that Ariosto, as a modern Christian poet, is at once superior to the ancient epic poets and free to depart from their example, yet good at imitating them and in following "verie strictly" Aristotle's "rules" of epic poetry. It is in accordance with both these lines of defence that in his marginal and end-of-canto annotations Harington interprets the poem and comments upon it. Then, at the end of the book, in the general allegory, he makes use of a not altogether like-minded treatise by Bononome 16 in order to present a serious, coherent summary of the good uses and profit to be had from reading the poem. Considering the readership, again, it is quite understandable that a great deal of Harington's apparatus should be intended to help the reader simply to follow and remember the story. The entire text of the advertisement to the reader is relevant here as a summary statement of Harington's authorial intentions, but it will be convenient to focus our attention, to begin with, on the remarks concerning the " Direction for continuing the diuers stories " and on the index: Further, where diuerse stories in this worke, seeme in many places abruptly broken off, I haue set directions in the margent, where to find the continuance of euery such storie, though I would not wish any to reade them in that order at the first reading, but if any thinke them worthie the twise reading, then he may the second time not vnconueniently vse it, if the meane matter betweene the so deuided stories (vpon which commonly they depend) be not quite out of his memorie. Then, later: If the name of anie man, woman, countrey, towne, horse, or weapon, seeme straunge to anie, I haue made a table where to find it. And in the same table, a direction for the seuerall tales, where to begin and end, those that may conueniently be read single, of which kind there are many, and those not vnpleasant. Ariosto's narrative method is too large a topic to be fully treated here. The particular points relevant to this discussion are the characteristic interruptions of the stories both within and at the end of the cantos (the two kinds of interruption are quite distinct from one another); the artistry in the succession of Ariosto's short narrative flights; the resumption of the preceding narratives at the beginning of each canto after the proemes; and the interposition in the narrative texture of a number of whole stories told consecutively from beginning to end. These last seem to be what Harington is referring to in his remarks quoted above on the "seuerall tales . . . that may conueniently be read single", even though the list of the tales includes not only these but some others—for example, the stories told by newly introduced characters in order to explain their present predicaments and (hardly surprisingly) such major episodes as the " Tale of Rogeros comming to Alcina" and the " Tale of Orlandos madnes ". By including these incomplete or interrupted narratives in the list of the tales, Harington clearly intended to make the list serviceable to those reading the book a second time, selectively; but his earlier remarks make it equally plain that he wished a first-time reader to begin at the beginning and to read the poem straight through, consecutively. That key phrase—"the meane matter betweene the so deuided stories (vpon which commonly they depend)"—is strikingly reminiscent of the words of a modern critic, C. P. Brand, on Ariosto's "specific contribution to the romance tradition": Ariosto's "invention" consists not in his creation of new characters or action but in the disposition, presentation and interpretation of the material he found in his sources, classical and medieval. His first great achievement was to create a structure in which this heterogeneous material could serve an artistic purpose. . . . His poem exploits the arts of the narrative in the true sense, taking the reader through a sequence of actions so arranged that successive canti recall, echo, illuminate or shade, parallel or contrast with each other, controlling and guiding the reader's response, evoking an emotional reaction not just by the poetry of its detailed components but by the relation of those components to each other over a lengthy narrative. 17 Whether Harington can be credited with a similar view of Ariosto's "invention" on the strength of one bare hint in the advertisement may be open to doubt; but at the very least he must have recognized that, when the threads of a story are picked up again, the reader is assumed to know about the developments in the plot that have taken place since it was broken off, and that without such knowledge the point would be missed of the many meetings, pursuits, vows, recognitions, exchanges and gifts and thefts of horses, armour, weapons, the magic ring, and so on, by which the plot is advanced. The memory of what is going on in all the various story-lines is an essential part of the poem's richness of texture. There are whole cantos in succession in which various major characters are never mentioned; they are off-stage, assembled in the wings or in the tiring-house, so to speak; or, more exactly, the reader knows, or should know, that Astolfo is still flying around the globe on the hippogriff (let us say), or that Fiordeliege is still seeking her beloved Brandimart. Harington's index permits the reader to refresh his memory on these points and, if need be, refer back to the text; so do those marginal directions that refer back; while those that refer forward not only are aids to selective reading but also, and perhaps more importantly, help the reader by telling him what to expect—how soon or how much later a story "abruptly broken off" will be resumed, how long there is to wait before knight recovers horse (say) or lover is reunited with lover. A similar concern to set the reader's expectations on the right course and to clarify the complexities of the plot, as well as to assist selective reading, is seen in the marginal notes on the stories' beginnings and endings, and in the practice of naming in the margin characters as they approach or appear, more often than not well before they are named in the text. It has to be admitted that all these aids to comprehension can sometimes be sharply at odds with Ariosto's narrative mystification (compare the text and marginal note at X: 47-48, for example). From the point of view of book design, however, the breaks between the cantos are the main thing, and they have their own special character. Ariosto's congedi at the end of each canto, followed by the proemi at the start of the next, serve quite a different function from the dropping within a canto of one narrative thread in order to pick up another. The congedi and the proemi enforce a pause, and at the same time, despite Ariosto's more sophisticated treatment of them, they hark back to the practice of his predecessors in the romance tradition, suspending the action at a particularly exciting point. 18 The proemi themselves are neatly made to fit their positions, facing as they do Janus-like to past and future, and the resumed narrative after the proemio invariably—or, rather, with only one exception 19 —takes up the story again at just the point where it was broken off by the preceding congedo . The narrative technique is time-worn and familiar, reminiscent of cliff-hanging endings in silent-film serials. Or, in more modern terms, it is as if the poet imposes a "freeze" (as the TV technicians call it) on the moving images of his story, and begins the next canto's narrative with the melting of the same "freeze". Or again, in perhaps more decorous terms, it is as if Shakespeare, by mingling together and modifying the principles of the romantic and classical drama in a way he did not, had permitted himself the grossest disunities of time, place and action from scene to scene, and yet had rigorously observed an unknown—and, of course, theatrically quite pointless — liaison des actes . 20 The elaborate treatment of the canto-breaks in the printed books—Valgrisi's, Franceschi's, Harington's—clearly reinforces the poet's own requirement of a pause. Hence the positioning of the plates immediately before each canto; hence the elaborately bordered verse-arguments (and, in the Italian editions, the prose allegorie ) at the top of the page above the beginning of the text; hence the ornamental initial in each first stanza, inviting the reader to start the new canto with the proeme. To be sure, a similar treatment of the canto-breaks (or such divisions) can be seen in other contemporary books of poetry where the same narrative technique is not used and where there is no regular liaison across the divide; but Ariosto's use of liaison was well understood by the illustrators of the Valgrisi and Franceschi editions that Harington used, and also by the author of the verse-arguments that Harington translated. The plates and the arguments of Harington's book are to be considered more fully later. Here it is appropriate to point out a rhythmical regularity that has not previously been commented upon. The borders surrounding the verse-arguments in Harington's book are of two kinds: one, a frame of type-ornaments; the other, a compartment made up of four head-pieces, i.e. ornamental woodblocks. The two borders alternate in a regular sequence, with a change of step at Book XXIV. This feature of the design was imitated, not from the Franceschi edition, where six different engraved borders are used in no particular order, but from the Valgrisi edition of 1556 or one of its reprints. In the 1556 edition, according to Mrs Falaschi, "Each canto is preceded by an argomento framed in an ornamental woodcut for which there are two alternating patterns consisting of putti, garlands and masks . . .". 21 Although there is no positive evidence on the matter, we may take it that Harington either suggested or at least approved of the imitation. Significantly, the alternating sequence—still with its change of step at Book XXIV, which seems not to have had Italian precedent—was to be preserved in the 1607 edition, printed by Field "for Iohn Norton and Simon VVaterson" and published in Harington's life-time. It was not preserved in the posthumous 1634 edition, printed "by G. Miller for J. Parker".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Harington "gaue direction" for the making of the plates and was particularly proud that they were "all cut in brasse". However, it is a striking fact that in only three of the plates were significant changes made to the designs. The remaining forty-three were copied as closely as possible within the limits of the English engravers' abilities. Why was this so? Lack of ideas, lack of a skilled draughtsman, or some such reason? Was Harington merely taking the easy—though most costly—way out, and filching the best illustrations he could find in the Italian editions? Or did he really understand and appreciate the effects achieved in Porro's plates and deliberately mean to transfer them into his own book? The truth, I think, embraces affirmative answers to all these questions. Harington intended his book to be a lavish production, but he also intended the illustrations to serve a practical purpose and to assist the reader in his understanding and enjoyment of the poem. He writes in the advertisement to the reader: The vse of the picture is euident, which is, that (hauing read ouer the booke) you may reade it (as it were againe) in the very picture, and one thing is to be noted, which euery one (haply) will not obserue, namely the perspectiue in euery figure. For the personages of men, the shapes of horses, and such like, are made large at the bottome, and lesser vpward, as if you were to behold all the same in a plaine, that which is nearest seemes greatest, and the fardest, shewes smallest, which is the chiefe art in picture. The striking thing about the remarks on the perspective, and for that matter about Ruscelli's remarks in his "A i lettori", which Harington is here translating and abridging and which originally referred to the woodcuts in the Valgrisi edition, is that they give no hint of the use to which the perspective is put or of the other means employed by the unknown artist of the Valgrisi woodcuts to represent Ariosto's poem in picture. Yet the Valgrisi artist sought to illustrate not only the action of the poem but also its shape and spirit; so, in his own way, did Porro; and there are good grounds for believing that Harington appreciated and respected Pooro's artistic purposes, or at least came in the end to appreciate and respect them. Porro's practice differs in a number of respects from that of his immediate predecessor, the Valgrisi artist, but the basic principles of illustration are the same. These Valgrisi woodcuts, too, had their models and precedents, as Mrs Falaschi has shown, but their unique character is what is of interest. They are the first full-page illustrations of Ariosto's poem and the first and last attempts to represent in full detail and in a single plate the entire substance of each canto. The perspective is the key to the interpretation of the multiple scenes, which usually (though not quite invariably) follow one another in narrative sequence upwards from the foot of the page, so that the figures—" cosi sfuggendosi, &amp; diminuendo a poco a poco "—become reduced to minute proportions at the top. Where the perspective does not follow the narrative sequence, it is because the artist has sensibly chosen to separate Paris from Damascus, for example, and to arrange the illustrated actions geographically in different parts of the illustration (Plate XVIII). The problem of perspective diminution was compounded by the small size of the wood-blocks. For Valgrisi's quarto edition, they were inserted in a series of what look like quite unnecessarily broad and elaborate factotum borders. They were used without the borders in Valgrisi's octavo edition, also first published in 1556. The task undertaken by the Valgrisi artist is indeed quite breathtaking, as well as eye-straining, in its ambition. The problems of illustration posed by Ariosto's poem each seem to have been systematically isolated and tackled. How to represent—say—a lady who vanishes, a palace which dissolves, a phantasm of different appearance to each beholder? How to represent the variety of personages in the poem, from the historical Charlemagne to the allegorical and prosopopoeical "Silence", "Pride" and "Discord"? How to illustrate immense journeys undertaken in the course of a few stanzas? What to do about the many reported narratives, some of which are the most vivid and amusing stories in the poem? Valgrisi's artist found solutions to all these problems and more, ranging from invention to systematic omission; but his aim was clearly to make his illustrations as comprehensive as possible. He even illustrated the final proeme, showing a large Ariosto in a small sailing boat approaching a quayside thronged with his patrons and friends. From our point of view, the important thing about the Valgrisi illustrations is that both the beginnings and the endings of the cantos are systematically represented: the first in the main scene of larger figures at the foot of the page, the latter diminutively somewhere at the top, very often in the top right-hand corner. There is thus a kind of pictorial liaison from one woodcut to the next, which parallels the poet's own liaison between the cantos. So, also, the points at which stories are "abruptly broken off" and later picked up again are illustrated in the body of the pictures, somewhere in the nearer or further middle distance. Porro, taking these woodcuts as his model, took over many of the same technical solutions. He, too, but more consistently, used perspective to represent the narrative sequence. He, too, omitted reported narratives, had his problems with the phantasms, represented the naked and invisible Angelica all too visibly, the palace of illusions all too solidly. His designs usually borrow a good deal from the Valgrisi woodcuts, often containing details that are reversed adaptations of those in the woodcuts, so that (for example) the endings of the narrative sequences usually appear in the top left-hand corner. We may confidently presume that Porro worked with the Valgrisi edition open before him, but he also consulted the text, usually carefully, in order to make his own adaptations and improvements. 22 Allowing himself more space by including his own narrow borders as an integral part of the engravings, he gave much greater prominence to the foreground scenes and carefully strengthened and varied the composition of the designs. He enlarged the principal figures and made use of architecture, rocks, foliage, and so on, to separate the smaller groups of figures into discrete sequences. However detailed they may be, his plates do not become mere frames for a mêlée of minute figures—as some of the Valgrisi woodcuts certainly do. Porro's main concern was to make his designs bolder and more dramatic. To do this, he occasionally omitted or conversely added or enlarged the illustration of the very first narrative stanzas of a canto. If these were omitted, the next few stanzas supplied the principal subject. He clarified the action, either by separating successive phases of an episode combined in one of the Valgrisi scenes or—conversely again—by combining in one bold design actions represented successively in the woodcuts. He altered the perspective, nearly always in order to bring it into closer accord with the narrative sequence (and if this meant mingling Paris and Damascus together in one continuous architectural composition, so it had to be). Porro's designs are more representational and less schematic than those of the woodcuts. He does not imitate the Valgrisi artist in illustrating some of the cantos from a bird's eye view; nor does he use maps to illustrate journeys; he makes no attempt to portray allegorical personages, except quite inconspicuously, or to find a way of representing in the illustrations such a passage as Saint John's praise of writers in canto XXXV, illustrated in the Valgrisi edition by a statue of "Immortality". More particularly, in the interests of artistic clarity and simplicity—a relative simplicity, to be sure—Porro frequently reduces the amount of background detail illustrating the latter parts of a canto, or he even omits to illustrate them altogether. Narrative sequence, not narrative significance, is the guiding principle, together with the search for opportunities in the first few pages of a canto for a good, striking foreground scene. The results of this procedure are at once admirable and curiously unsatisfactory. To take the most obvious example, Ruggiero's rescue of Angelica takes place towards the very end of canto X and is therefore illustrated only by tiny figures in the top left-hand corner of Plate X. Similarly, the pastoral idyll of Angelica and Medoro is shown only in the background of Plate XIX. The foreground of Plate XIX, at least, gives prominent treatment to Cloridan and Medoro, thanks to the continuation of that episode at the start of the canto; but, even there, it is a later part of the episode that is illustrated, not the famous passage in canto XVIII describing their nocturnal search for the body of Dardanello, hidden in darkness and then suddenly illuminated by the moon. (This is illustrated in the background of Valgrisi's Plate XVIII, but not in Porro's.) At their worst, Porro's methods bring about some quite ludicrous distortions of emphasis. Thus, in Plate IV, a conspicuous detail in the foreground of an otherwise admirable design illustrates Bradamante's purchase of a horse from an inn-keeper—a mere narrative iota (Ariosto, IV: 10. 3-5) and omitted by Harington from his translation—but Ruggiero's conversion and baptism (Ariosto, XLI:59) are not illustrated at all in Plate XLI, though the deficiency is partially made good in Plate XLIV. The lack of illustration of reported narrative is also unsatisfying. It means the omission, for example, of Pinabello's vivid description of Atlante and his flying horse in canto II, an important passage because it gives the reader his introduction to the hippogriff. Yet Porro's methods do peculiarly and no doubt deliberately befit and exploit the exact location of his plates in the Franceschi edition, coming as they do regularly between the end of one canto and the beginning of the next. The principal scenes represent, if not precisely the moments of narrative "freeze" (and some of them do exactly that), then at least the immediately following or closely following action. Their subjects are usually intelligible, at least in a general way, to the reader who has finished the previous canto and not yet started the following one. No more than the principal scenes are thus broadly intelligible, and even they can only be fully interpreted by reading on. Moreover Porro departs from his usual practice, for perfectly defensible artistic reasons, in Plates XXII, XL and XLI, as well as in Plate XXXII where Ariosto's narrative required him to do so. Nevertheless, it may fairly be said that Porro's method of illustration reinforces the poet's own liaison at the canto-breaks rather more emphatically than does that of the Valgrisi artist. However Porro did not attempt to maintain any consistent kind of liaison from plate to plate. That kind of liaison is present or not in his plates, or sometimes only tenuously suggested, according to the exigencies of the designs. The English engravers' copies of the Italian plates now need to be compared with Harington's translation itself. Philip Hofer remarked that the English engravers "copied both subject and style, while the translator . . . went to the opposite extreme, and took bold liberties with the text!" 23 This, I believe, gives quite the wrong impression. The generally good accord between the plates and the translation is what needs to be emphasized, not the quite numerous small discrepancies. The principal scenes are all perfectly intelligible by reference to the translation, and apart from Plate IV, already mentioned, there are only two plates out of the forty-six where details given prominent or conspicuous treatment by Porro are inadequately explained in the text. These discrepancies occur in Books XIII and XVII. In both, it may be said that they work ultimately to the benefit of the book as a whole— faute de mieux , that is, and assuming thorough revision of the verse was impracticable. Both, interestingly, are the result of Harington's systematic abridgement in the translation of scenes of cruelty and suffering. In Book XIII, Orlando's brutal punishment of the outlaws who had held Isabella captive in their cave is condensed to a single undescriptive final couplet: Their feet, nor yet their fence, could them so gard, But that he brought them to the hanging ward. (Harington, XIII:36; cf. Ariosto, XIII:41) Plate XIII represents conspicuously, in the upper left-hand quarter, just how this was done. Orlando pulls at a rope to drag his prisoners out of the cave, and above, the outlaws' corpses hang by their chins from the lopped branches of a dead-looking tree. The outlaws' fate is clear to the English reader, even though some of the details in the plate may be puzzling. The other major discrepancy is similar. In Book XVII, Rodomont's martial exploits within the walls of Paris are much abbreviated in the translation, which preserves the vehicle of an epic simile of a snake shedding its skin but omits the tenor, the description of Rodomont's shining helmet and armour, together with all the narrative describing his Pyrrhus-like assault on the palace with fire and sword and the terror of the trapped Christians within (Ariosto, XVII:9-13; Harington, XVII:6-9). All this is carefully illustrated in the plate, and although the details are not explained in the text, the scene is readily comprehensible by an English reader as both illustrating and elaborating Harington's stanzas. A few words also need to be said about the alterations made to Porro's designs as they were copied for Harington's book. 24 Plate XXVIII, as is well known, was altered by the removal of an architectural background to make room for a pictorial summary of the " Tale of mine Host " about Jocundo, the story which—as tradition has it—first involved Harington in his work of translation and for which he incurred his penance of having to carry it through to completion before being allowed back to court. The light-hearted spirit in which the penance was probably imposed may be gauged from the inclusion in the plate of three scenes of copulation as background vignettes. Plate V was also altered, no doubt by Harington's direction, to include scenes of love. Dalinda's tale of Polinesso's amorous " sleights " is represented at bottom left and the traveller's tale of Ariodante's "saltus amatorius" at top right. There was also a minor change, with nothing (for once) overtly amorous about it, in Plate III. Atlante's castle is shown at top left, presumably to illustrate Melissa's description of it (although according to the narrative the castle does not come into view until the next canto), and a mountain goat at top right is presumably there to suggest the dizzy height of the precipice. Otherwise, the only changes are just as Mrs Falaschi has reported them: two plates reversed (Plate IV and XVII), one copied perforce not from Porro's engraving but from the Valgrisi woodcut and enlarged and reversed in the process (Plate XXXIV), some minor but sensitive improvements (Plates XIII and XXIII), some errors of copying in the labelling, and a number of small omissions and simplifications of detail in the designs and in the borders. Plates XXXIX and XLVI, particularly, are rather crude and simplified by comparison with the originals. None of Porro's various errors of interpretation, large or small, was corrected. 25 The alterations in Plates III, V and XXVIII all violate Porro's principle of not illustrating reported narrative. We may assume that Harington disliked that principle, or at least was not going to let it stand in his way in his treatment of two favourite cantos. He seems also to have been dissatisfied by the lack of prominence given in Porro's Plate X to Rogero's rescue of Angelica. The Bodleian manuscript shows that he had toyed with the idea of including a full-page plate illustrating that episode, though just where it might have been fitted into the printed book is not at all clear. Considering the plates by themselves, the eventual dropping of the Rogero and Angelica illustration is probably the strongest piece of evidence we have that Harington came in the end to understand and respect Porro's principle of using perspective to indicate narrative sequence. What of the effects of liaison from canto to canto? Harington understood and respected these, too, as can be seen from his treatment of the Italian verse-arguments and from the effects of their juxtaposition with the plates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Since the Italian "Argomenti" and the Valgrisi woodcuts were first published together, it seems probable on purely a priori grounds that there would have been a certain measure of collaboration between the author of the arguments and the artist of the woodcuts—if only to the extent of one consulting the other's work, when it was possible to do so, as well as the text of the poem itself. They seem in fact to have agreed on a common approach, each working towards the same ends according to the potentialities of his own medium. However, neither Ruscelli in his "A i lettori" nor Harington in his advertisement to the reader say very much about the function of the arguments in the context of the book as a whole. Ruscelli writes merely: " Gli Argomenti in ottaua rima , che habbiamo posti in questo Libro di Canto in Canto , sono del Signor Scipione Ammirato , giouane di belle lettere , di felicissima vena , &amp; di molti studij ." Harington, true to form, is a little more forthcoming, but not much: "Also (according to the Italian maner) I haue in a staffe of eight verses comprehended the contents of euery booke or canto, in the beginning thereof, which hath two good vses, one, to vnderstand the picture the perfecter, the other, to remember the storie the better." What is common to these two editorial comments about the arguments is that they draw attention to the fitness of their form and their location. The arguments are written in the same verse-form as the poem itself (Italian or English), and they are " posti . . . di Canto in Canto " "in the beginning thereof". Like the plates with which they are associated, the arguments serve the double purposes of introduction and recapitulation, whetting the reader's appetite to continue and at the same time helping him to remember and consider what he has read. However the forty-six stanzas (Italian or English) may also be read in sequence, as a miniature version of the whole poem. The sequence bears a certain resemblance to a "corona" of sonnets, and one suspects that readers may sometimes have attempted to use them as epitomes, as a substitute for reading the poem itself at length. In the Italian arguments, all the main-springs of the plot—characters, motives, actions, consequences—are neatly abstracted and fixed in the reader's memory by a variety of means: crisp characterization (especially of the villains in the story), repetition of key words and names, and a complex syntax in which much use is made of participles, phrases in apposition, and so on, in order to give at least some idea of the connections between the various stages of the plot. The final couplet of one stanza is regularly echoed in some way in the next one's opening lines, so that the stanzas are linked together in sequence in a way that imitates and represents Ariosto's own effects of liaison between cantos. Harington's practice of breaking up Ammirato's long, complex sentences into a number of shorter and simpler ones does introduce some obscurities of time-sequence, motivation, and the like, and for the sake of brevity Harington rather more frequently relies on bare proper names, lacking characterization or with the characterization much reduced. Thus " Pinabel di Maganza , traditore " (II:vii), for example, becomes plain " Pinnabel " and Gabrina, instead of being called " la vecchia odiata e vilipesa " (XXI:iv), becomes merely a " most unvvorthy wight ". Sometimes, also, the connection between the final couplet of one argument and the opening lines of the next is lost or weakened by absence of repetition. It is reasonable to assume that all such changes were forced on Harington by technical difficulty, but there are also other changes in the English arguments which seem to be clearly deliberate departures from the Italian, made in order to present the poem in a different light or to offer different interpretations. The argument to Book VII, for example, is one of several made to conform with the moral and allegorical interpretations of the story given in Harington's end-of-canto notes, and there the English wording departs so radically from Ammirato's Italian that it can almost be considered free composition. In the Valgrisi edition, more often than not, the first and last lines of the "Argomenti" correspond closely with the beginnings and endings of the narrative sequences as they are represented in the woodcuts; indeed, the artist's comprehensive method of illustration ensured that practically everything mentioned in the "Argomenti" would be represented somewhere or other in the woodcuts—if only one has the patience to find it. In the Franceschi edition, the correspondences between the plates and the "Argomenti" are not so close, for reasons that have already been explained: the different choice of principal scenes, the greater prominence given to them, the lack of illustration of later episodes in the cantos, and so on. Generally speaking, Harington's book has much the same measure of correspondence between plates and arguments as Franceschi's book has—less than that of the Valgrisi edition, but still present in varying degrees from canto to canto. In some cantos practically everything in the argument is illustrated; more often, the beginning but not the end of the argument is illustrated; in only one quite exceptional instance—Book XXVI—nothing mentioned in the argument is represented in the plate (except " Merlins well ") and nothing illustrated in the plate, except the well, is mentioned in the argument. In what way, then, did Harington mean the arguments to help the reader "to vnderstand the picture the perfecter"? When it comes to close reading of the plates, the arguments are clearly of no help, but with the principal scenes it is different. A number of Harington's alterations in the arguments seem quite evidently to have been made in order to bring them into better accord with the principal scenes of the corresponding or following plates. His practice is by no means consistent, and one could wish that a few more such alterations had been made; but there are enough of them to be sure that Harington deliberately sought by this means to achieve or to restore in the context of his own book not only a good correspondence between arguments and plates but also a clear sense of liaison from canto to canto. It is necessary to list and briefly to describe a fair range of examples: Charles hath the foyle , Angelica flyes thence : (I:i) Fugge Angelica sola; e da Rinaldo . . . (I:i) Porro redesigned Plate I so that Charlemagne and the battle are brought to the foreground. Moreover Harington seems to have taken the Christian defeat at "Burdells", and not Angelica's flight, as the true starting-point of the poem: cf. I:5-10; VIII:64.8 (Ariosto, VIII:72.8); and XIV:1 mn. Dalinda tels what sleights her Duke devised To get with faire Geneura reputation . (V:i-ii) These lines, for which there is no equivalent in the Italian, match the illustration of Dalinda's story in Plate V. While Agramant musters his men of armes . (XIII:viii) Agramant mustring of his men, doth misse Two bands that by Orlando late were slaine , (XIV:i-ii) Fa la mostra Agramante de la guerra . (XIII:viii) Vede Agramante due squadre hauer meno Il campo suo, ch'Orlando sol l'ha morte . (XIV:i-ii) Porro in Plate XIV gave much greater emphasis than the Valgrisi artist did to Agramant's musters. Harington reinforces the emphasis by repetition, and characteristically chooses not to emphasize Orlando's single-handed feat of arms. Yet still the good Zerbino trauels vvith her , And manie a vverie mile they rode togither . (XXI:vii-viii) Onde accresce uer lei l'odio, e la stizza . Poi doue ode alti gridi il caual drizza . (XXI:vii-viii) Harington's alteration in line vii brings the argument into better accord with the proeme to Book XXI, where Zerbino is presented as an example of good faith and the keeping of promises, however difficult (cf. XXI: Moral). The alteration in line viii is more significant, since it shows Harington's characteristic treatment of a canto-break handled untypically by Ariosto and by Porro. In the final stanza of canto XXI Zerbino hears the sounds of fighting and screaming—they are Pinabello's dying screams. The resumed narrative in canto XXII gives only a brief anticipation of Zerbino's discovery of the as yet unnamed corpse; the story will be told fully in canto XXIII. Porro's Plate XXII, unlike the Valgrisi woodcut, omits the corpse and has for its principal scene the next episode of Astolfo at the palace of illusions; Porro is reserving the corpse for the foreground of Plate XXIII. Harington, tender-hearted as usual, omitted Pinabello's dying screams from the translation. The eighth line of his argument thus removes a source of considerable potential embarrassment in translation, narrative, picture and design. Orlando falls starke mad, with sorrow taken , To heare his mistres hath him quite forsaken . (XXIII:vii-viii) . . . e poscia che si troua offeso De la sua Donna, incominciò l'orrenda Pazzia, ch'altra non fu mai sí stupenda . (XXIII:vi-viii) This is an example of a change made in order to bring the argument more into line with the interpretations given in the notes. In writing the notes of allusion to Book XXIII, Harington borrowed what he wanted from Fornari and Lavezuola, but he deliberately omitted Fornari's description of Orlando's madness as something altogether uncommon, grand, and marvellous (cf. McNulty, p. xxviii, where the passage from Fornari is quoted). His treatment of the argument is precisely similar. But Doralices horse, by fiend of hell , Affrighted, doth his mistresse beare away , Which causd the Pagans both breake of the fray . (XXVI:vi-viii) . . . Ma doue il viso bello Fugge di Doralice, il Re gagliardo Di Sarza il destrier volge, e Mandricardo . (XXVI:vi-viii) Plate XXVII has Doralice's bolting horse as its most conspicuous foreground feature. The incident is interpreted allegorically in the notes to Book XXVII. The Hermit warnes her keepe her vow and oth , At which the Pagan Prince is passing wroth . (XXVIII:vii-viii) Ma sí l'impedimento li dispiace Del frate, ch'ella ha seco in compagnia , Che'l fellon il dà morte acerba e ria . (XXVIII:vi-viii) Porro's Plate XXIX illustrates Rodomont's rage and, unlike the Valgrisi woodcut, does not illustrate the manner of the hermit's death—Rodomont hurls him into the sky and out of the story (Ariosto and Harington: XXIX: 6-7). Marfisa doth present her selfe before King Charles, and in his presence is baptized : (XXXVIII:i-ii) Torna in Arli Ruggier: Con Bradamante Marfisa à Carlo, e qui si fa Cristiana . (XXXVIII:i-ii) Porro's Plate XXXVIII, again unlike the Valgrisi woodcut, omits Rogero's departure. Harington was no doubt glad to follow suit for the sake of some extra syllables, and could feel free to do so since Rogero's departure to serve his King is lengthily praised in the proeme. Good Brandimart receaues a deadly wound (XLI:viii) Orlando of his conquest takes small ioy , Which caused him his dearest frend to want , (XLII:i-ii) . . . De la gran pugna poco lieto è sciolto . (XLII:vii) Harington here brings forward the " poco lieto " from Ammirato's argument for canto XLIII. The earlier Italian arguments make no mention of Brandimart's death-wound but emphasize Orlando's victory and the defeat of the infidel champions. In Plate XLII, Brandimart lies wounded in the foreground, but the motive for the change is almost certainly literary, not pictorial. Harington chooses to prepare the ground for the sad and solemn ending of the love-story of Brandimart and Fiordeliege. One last example may be given here, out of sequence: Angelica by drowsie hermit laid , Is tane and bound all naked to the shore : (VIII:v-vi) . . . after which he found , Angelica vnto the rocke fast bound (X:vii-viii) Angelica, trouata al vecchio à canto , Per cibo del marin monstro s' allaccia . (VIII:v-vi) . . . e poi legata Angelica, è per lui tosto saluata . (X:vii-viii) Is it too fanciful to suggest that the translations here are intended to make up in some measure for the loss of the full-page plate illustrating Rogero's rescue of Angelica? That Harington was determined to give prominence to the "naked" and "bound" Angelica, somehow or other? The lines at least do something to repair the botched translation of the stanzas in the narrative: Harington, X:81-85; Ariosto, X:95-99. At their best, the canto divisions in Harington's book are extraordinarily well handled, especially where plate and argument appear on facing pages. A canto-beginning is carefully prepared for in the endings of the previous argument and of the previous canto itself, and on turning over the leaf a wealth of information is displayed through several media: pictorial, poetical, typographical, even marginal. Plate complements argument, proeme complements both (and is the reader's entry-point into the new canto), the topic of the proeme is picked up and developed in the notes (and there may well be a marginal reference to the notes), 26 and with any luck the very stanzas illustrated in the principal scene of the plate will be there on the facing first page. Particularly good examples of this kind of collaboration among all or nearly all of these elements may be seen in Books I, IV, VII, X, XIV, XVI, XVIII, XXIII, XXVII and XXX, and there are many others which, though less good all round, still offer many delights—particularly in the plates. However, a good many of the plates do not in fact face the canto-beginnings, but appear overleaf on the preceding recto. This is a puzzling aspect of the design of Harington's book and of the Italian editions as well, even though the puzzle may largely be a twentieth-century one. Sixteenth-century readers may have found the arrangement more tolerable than we do. (McNulty in his critical edition very properly, but anachronistically, had all the plates arranged to face the canto-beginnings.) Since the plates do have their retrospective qualities, their appearance on the preceding rectos can no doubt be considered a fair second-best; but second-best it certainly is, and so also it seems to have been considered by the sixteenth-century editors. Of the forty-six plates, thirty-three appear on versos facing the canto-beginnings in the Valgrisi and Franceschi editions. In Harington's book, only twenty-seven of them do—leaving nineteen that appear overleaf. Before examining this question further, it is necessary to consider more closely than we have yet done Harington's method of annotating each canto.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V The critical purposes served by the work of annotation are not our present concern, but rather the use of space. From the point of view of book design, Harington's method of annotation can be seen as an ingenious solution to a practical difficulty. He sought to imitate his Italian sources by publishing an annotated edition, but Ruscelli's canto-by-canto "Annotationi" could supply him with very little material towards his own notes: they are mostly comments on the fine points of Ariosto's use of the Italian language. Harington's solution was to borrow what he wanted from his other sources—the commentaries and the Valvassori prose allegorie 27 —and to transfer all this borrowed material into his end-of-canto notes and also (sometimes) into his marginal notes. All, that is, except the material borrowed for the general allegory and the life of Ariosto, which as we have seen were probably later additions to the book's contents. The omission of prose allegorie at the head of Harington's cantos makes sense as a consequence of this method. He needed the material for the end-of-canto notes, and to transfer it there had the additional advantage of bringing forward the first seven stanzas of a canto on to the first page, instead of four as in the Franceschi and Valgrisi editions, so that—whether consequently or, possibly, of set purpose—there was a better chance that the principal scene of an illustration would face the very stanza or stanzas it illustrated. 28 Ideally both sets of annotations, Italian and English, should have regularly come to an end at the foot of a recto page, so that the following plate would appear on the next verso. However, this ideal could not always be achieved, for quite often the annotations end neatly at the foot of a verso, facing the next plate, and sometimes they end too soon, well above the foot of the page. In Harington's book, if the notes ended rather high on the page, a tailpiece was regularly used to help fill up the remaining blank space. Where the verse of a canto happened to come to an end on the page —recto or verso, high up or low down or in the middle—made a good deal of difference to the ease or difficulty of achieving or approximating the desired effect. Where the verse ended high on a verso, the notes would need to be greatly extended to reach to the foot of the next recto; where the verse ended low on a recto, they would need to be either greatly compressed in order to fit, or else greatly extended to fill up the next two pages as well. Where the ideal was unattainable, it was usually possible to achieve at least one of the ideal conditions—a neat finish at the foot of the page, or alternatively the plate correctly imposed on a verso so that it faced the canto-beginning. The method used by Ruscelli and Valgrisi to adjust the length of the "Annotationi" and to work out their relationships with the following plates is not known. Whatever it was, it worked. Franceschi simply adopted the same layout, but improved on it by adding new copy (presumably also written by Ruscelli) to the notes to cantos XXVII and XXXVIII, so that they too end at the foot of the page in his edition, as they do not in Valgrisi's. 29 In difficult cases, at least one or other of the two conditions for ideal layout is satisfied. There is only one exception to this, at the break following canto XXXVII, and even there the annotations fill up a good two-thirds of the page. In all other cases where much space is left blank, the "Annotationi" finish on a recto, followed by a plate properly facing its canto-beginning. The treatment of the "Annotationi" to canto XXXVI is of particular interest. There the very brief notes could quite easily have fitted below the verse, and were probably originally intended to go there; but they were imposed on the following recto, leaving much blank space at the bottom of both pages (pp. 410-411), presumably so that the following plate would appear on a verso. In Harington's book, there are three canto-breaks where neither of the conditions for ideal layout are met. In the first two of these, the breaks following Books XVIII and XXV, the notes do fill up most of the remainder of the verso page even though some space is left blank. The third, following Book XXX, is a striking exception to the general rule and conspicuously fails to meet either condition. One suspects a blunder somewhere, and a blunder can be found. It will be discussed in some detail shortly. There is no doubt at all that Harington concerned himself personally with these questions of layout. We have the evidence of remarks made in the text of the annotations themselves—mostly grumbles about the lack of space available to him, e.g. at II: Allegory, IV: History, XIV: History, XV: History, and elsewhere—and also of several of his instructions to the printer. Moreover Harington's recorded words can be set in a wider context by examining the results achieved in the book itself and also, where possible, the means used to achieve these results. From all this we can be sure that Harington, as a rule, liked his annotations to finish neatly at the foot of a page, even if it meant making cross-references from one part of his apparatus to another in order to avoid running over the space available for any particular set of notes. How much he cared about the location of the plates (recto or verso) is harder to determine. His recorded words are silent on the topic, so that one is driven to relying on inferences from the book itself and from the printer's copy. Consider, for example, Harington's instruction to the printer given at the end of the notes to Book XXIX. These notes include two verse-quotations, one Latin, one English, which in the manuscript are both written out in long lines, two lines of verse to one of script. The four lines of Latin verse are each numbered, but not the lines of English verse—it is probable that Harington thought of these latter as three lines of verse with internal rhyme as well as end rhyme, for they are also set out as three lines in Ruth Hughey's edition of The Arundel Harington Manuscript of Tudor Poetry (1960; no. 177). The instruction to Field reads: "Yf thear bee roome enowgh in the page print the verses at length yf not then print them as they are heer written. and yf need bee leave out the latten verse quyte." Harington did not wish the notes to run over on to the next printed page. At it turned out, there was "roome" for the Latin verses to be printed "at length", but the six (or three) lines of English verse remained set out as three. Plate XXX appears properly on the next verso, but there is no means of knowing if this is what Harington was aiming for, or if he merely wished to have a neat finish at the foot of the page. In the manuscript, the tail end of the notes to Book XXXV is squeezed in above the heading to Book XXXVI. The notes end with a reference to Hudson's Du Bartas, but there is room for only one line of the poem to be quoted. In the printed book the quotation has been lengthened, presumably in proof, by a further five lines. The effect is to strengthen Harington's point and at the same time to bring the end of the notes nearer to the foot of the page. Plate XXXVI, alas, appears opposite, but at least one of the conditions for ideal layout has been met. Similarly, the notes of allusion to Book XXVIII (the tale of Jocundo) are made to fit: " Historie nor Allegorie, nor scant any thing that is good, can be picked out of this bad booke: but for Allusions, they come in my mynd so plentifully, as I can scant tell how to make an end, when I am once enterd into them: Only I will touch one or two , ( to fill up this page withall ). . . . Plate XXIX, alas, once again appears on a recto. Where Harington had much space to fill, verse-quotation was a convenient means of filling it—for example, of whole sonnets by Constable (Book XXXIV) and by Sidney (Books XI and XVI). In such places, also (e.g. Book XVII) Harington will expatiate in lengthy passages of free composition on the favourite topics of his social criticism. However, neither of these techniques seems to have been regularly used for the sake of ensuring that the following plates would appear on versos. So far, in fact, there is little to suggest that Harington really cared whether the plates appeared on versos or rectos; but the blunder at the cantobreak following Book XXX, I believe, tips the balance in favour of the suggestion that he did. Here moreover we have a closer glimpse into Harington's working methods. The blunder seems to have been caused by reliance on faulty stanza-numbering in the manuscript. Stanza numbers 35-39 in Book XXX had been repeated, so that the last stanza of the canto was originally misnumbered "84" instead of "89"—though, like the others, it was later corrected. When he wrote the end-of-canto notes to Book XXX, Harington must have thought he had more space than in fact was available to him. The notes take up twenty lines of type and would have fitted comfortably under seven final stanzas of verse (78-84); but in fact there were five more stanzas, and here Harington had not left instructions to the printer that the notes were to be cut "yf need bee". The printers duly cast off and followed their copy, and the text necessarily runs over to the top of the next page, ending high on sig. Y1v after only twelve lines of type. It is followed by a tailpiece—the only tailpiece in all the annotations to appear on a verso. Here, at least, Harington seems to have calculated the length of his notes without reference to the not-yet-printed sheets, relying on the stanza-numbering and on his knowledge that the verse was to be set out in regular equal lengths of seven stanzas at a time. If his calculations had been sound, all would have been well and both conditions for ideal layout would have been satisfied. The miscalculation in Book XXX, as is the way with these things, led to another one in Book XXXI. There, under the twelve final stanzas, Harington tucked in a very brief note on the moral. It is the shortest end-of-canto note in the whole book, a mere four lines of type, and ends: ". . . The rest of the booke hath no new matter, but such as hath bin noted before: and therefore I will end this little space with this short note ." Plate XXXII appears opposite, but if the notes to Book XXX had been calculated aright, the whole sequence from Plate XXXI onwards would have been imposed one page earlier, and Harington's " short note " would have appeared properly at the foot of the preceding recto. That, I suggest, was the real reason why he kept the note so untypically short. These two examples, in which it is possible to trace failures to achieve ideal layout back to an observable miscalculation, lead me to think that, in fact, Harington did prefer the plates to appear facing the canto-beginnings. He must have been disappointed that in the finished book so many of his plates appear on rectos, by comparison with those of Franceschi's book. Just how much further one can trace the consequences of this miscalculation is unclear. Many of the following plates appear on rectos (Plates XXXIII, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXIX, etc.) but the notes to Book XXXIII are very long and one doubts whether Harington would have attempted to plan ahead beyond them. 30 Several of these canto-breaks are difficult cases where the verse itself ends at the foot of the page, and Harington has contented himself with supplying one full page of annotations. If only they could somehow have been imposed one page earlier or later, the results would have been very much better. However, in Book XXXVI, at least, Harington must have been aware that the following plate was to appear on a recto, for the notes to that book were written after the verse had been cast off. Harington must have seen the notation indicating the position of the plate on sig. 2C6: Cc11/305 for he deleted the top line of it and wrote the last few words of his notes around it. Perhaps—who knows?—the following pages had already been printed, and Harington was late in supplying the copy for these notes. Possibly also the notes to Book XXXII were supplied late, for they stop abruptly at the foot of the verso printed page, and a tentative continuation of them in the manuscript is heavily deleted. One suspects that all these imperfections of layout may be related to Harington's absence or irregular attendance at the printing-house during this time. All these cantos are among those for which end-of-canto notes survive with the printer's copy. 31 Such an explanation would account for the much higher success-rate in achieving ideal layout of the plates in the first half of the book. Book XLVI, of course, is a special case. There the Italian "Annotationi" end neatly at the foot of a verso page, facing the title-page of the "Cinque Canti", not translated by Harington. Harington's notes, unconstrained by plate or title-page, continue to the top of the next recto, where they take up six lines of type. They are followed by the line: "Here end the notes of the 46, and last Canto of Orlando Furioso "—a phrase that recalls the running-titles of that canto in the Italian editions, "CANTO QVARANTESIMOSESTO, ET VLTIMO". In the manuscript there is the most famous of all Harington's instructions to the printer: Mr Feeld I dowt this will not come in in the last page, and thearfore I would have immedyatly in the next page after the fynyshinge of this last booke, with some prety knotte: to set down the tytle, and a peece of the Allegory as followeth in this next page. 32 (The remainder, concerning choice of type for preface, general allegory, and "all the prose that ys to come", was quoted earlier.) What exactly Harington had in mind when he asked for "some prety knotte" is impossible to determine. It sounds as if he were perhaps thinking of another tailpiece. At all events, Field's workmen used their common-sense and, very appropriately, chose a large headpiece to mark this major division in the text—the same headpiece as would be used for the dedication to the Queen. The canto-break following Book XXIII is also a special case, and rather a remarkable one. It deserves to be discussed at some length. This cantobreak marks the mid-point of the poem, for Book XXIII ends with the story of the onset of Orlando's madness, the centre-piece of Ariosto's poem and the heart of what Harington called " the chiefe Allegorie of all the booke, and where-vpon the booke taketh his name Orlando Furioso" (XXXIX: Allegory). Harington made a number of special adjustments in his apparatus to make sure that his readers understood the importance of the episode. This was necessary because the madness of Orlando was not by any means the principal topic of Italian critical debate about the poem. Fornari in his Spositione , the critic from whom Harington borrowed most extensively, devoted the second of his two volumes to an explanation of the allegory, but far from interpreting the whole poem he concentrated his attention on the story of Ruggiero and Alcina and its ramifications. The same emphasis on Ruggiero and Alcina is seen in Bononome's "Allegoria", and also in Harington's general allegory, despite the adjustments made to the text in an attempt to give prominence to Orlando. The end-of-canto notes to Book XXIII are rather compressed by lack of space, and allegorical interpretation of the episode is deferred " till I come to restoring of his wit againe: which I count more proper for this subiect ", but Harington did find space in the notes of allusion for an interesting comment on the artistic, literary, indeed Aristotelian qualities of the episode, on its psychological truth and its power to move. As we saw earlier, this note was taken—adapted, that is to say, not merely borrowed—partly from Fornari and partly from Lavezuola, and the argument to Book XXIII was also adjusted in exactly the same spirit. In all these various small ways, then, Harington can be seen to be altering his critical material in an attempt to redress the balance, and to express his own reading or vision of the poem; but commentary alone, however teased and twisted, was not enough. In the Italian editions, the design-treatment of the canto-break following canto XXIII is not distinguished in any way from the others. However, Field was given the highly significant authorial instruction: "Between the xxiijth booke and the xxiiijth I would have a spare leafe . . ."—maddeningly, the sentence is unfinished because the rest has been trimmed away in binding. Yet, instead of a "spare leafe", the printed book has a blank page-opening. Harington had forgotten that the plate for Book XXIV should appear on a verso, facing the start of the next canto, and that therefore his "spare leafe" would necessarily have been accompanied by further blank pages to either side; unless, that is, he chose to find some means of filling them—say, by extending the notes to Book XXIII on to the following verso and by concocting some sort of a title-page for the recto preceding the second half of the poem. Harington chose otherwise, and accepted the blank page-opening. 33 That there were some uncertainties in the printing-house about what was going on is clear from the irregular four-leaf gathering at the end of Book XXIII and from the confused page-numbers throughout Book XXIV and at the start of Book XXV (i.e. all the next regular gathering). In the manuscript, the entire sequence of printers' notations between P.12/178 at XXIII: 8 and S.11./209 at XXVI:36 is in one way or another deficient or incorrect. The confusion in the printed book, however, is much greater here than in other places, where there are also lengthy sequences of missing or erroneous printers' notations in the manuscript. The picture that emerges is a pretty illustration of the relations between one printer and his author at the end of the sixteenth century. Harington knew what he wanted; Field knew what was practicable; together they reached a compromise solution, and in doing so caused a good deal of trouble to the workmen. In other places, somewhat similar means are used to draw attention to a fundamental division at the mid-point of the poem and to the importance of Orlando's heroical—or perhaps we should call it heroi-comical—loss and recovery of his wits. Below the notes of allusion in Book XXIII the customary line appears, but the wording is different. Instead of something like "The end of the annotations vpon the xxiij. booke", which would have been typical, we read "Here end the first xxiij. bookes of Ariosto", and there is adequate but not excessive room below for a tailpiece. The contents-list similarly divides the poem into two halves, leaving a large gap, a thick white line, between the two entries, thus: The first xxiij Cantos, or bookes of Orlando Furioso, ending with Orlandos falling mad. The other xxiij Cantos of Orlando Furioso, in which he recouered his wits; ending with Bradamants marriage. One hesitates to place much emphasis on such small points as these, but they are clearly done with a purpose—the same purpose as prompted Harington to ask for his "spare leafe". It might show less than perfect balance on my own part to descant at any great length on the significance of these two blank pages at the heart of Harington's book. Yet they are rich in significance—multiple rather than single. On consideration, the blank page-opening can be seen to be an improvement upon the "spare leafe" Harington originally asked for, rather than a mere compromise solution. Here the reader does indeed bend his eye on vacancy. The vacancy within Orlando's skull is matched by the vacancies in the ranks of Charlemagne's paladins, and just as Orlando loses his wits at the end of Book XXIII, so Bradamant at the start of the canto loses her way and is unable to return to Rogero. The blank double-spread accentuates the canto-break so that the "first xxiij Cantos" are distinguished from the "other xxiij Cantos" that are to follow; and the break in the narrative texture affects all three of the poem's main story-lines. The pause has become an interval, a deep breath at the mid-point of the poem. The interesting thing about all this is that Harington had no Italian precedents for these features of the typographical design, or rather that he imitated Italian precedents and then took them one stage further. He followed Ruscelli, Valgrisi and Franceschi in making the annotations fit the space available for them on the page, so that the great majority of the pages in his book are printed from top to bottom of the printing surface. Only if this norm was clearly discernible would the two blank pages at the centre—for which there was no Italian precedent—have significance. Similarly he followed the 1556 Valgrisi edition (or one of its reprints) in maintaining an alternating sequence in the ornament of the canto-beginnings, and only in the context of that regularity does the change of step at Book XXIV also acquire significance. In the arrangement of the front and end matter and in the choice of type for the preface, general allegory, and life of Ariosto, he contrived a consistent design and sense of orderly sequence in the English book that are quite lacking in the Italian editions, yet wholly in keeping with the rhythmical presentation of the poem itself and its accompanying material; and the printing of the poem itself in roman, not italics, was just one of the many ways in which Ariosto's stanzas were tactfully "tempered to the obstinate humours of the island". 34 There could hardly be a better example than Harington's Ariosto of "triumphal form" in which the "centre" is "finessed", i.e. treated negatively; but the means used to achieve the effect were not the line-counting methods of numerology—which (it seems) interested neither Ariosto nor Harington—but rather the silent poetry of book design. 35 Harington expressly admired the shaping of Ariosto's poem, praising among much else its first and last lines and remarking in his life of Ariosto how "absolute a peece of worke" the poem is and how "euery matter" is "brought . . . to a good and well pleasing conclusion". He equally admired Ariosto's skills as a story-teller, recognizing his ability to "draw a man with a continuall thirst to reade out the whole worke" (Preface). He expressly declared the story of Orlando's loss and recovery of his wits to be the " chiefe Allegorie of all the booke ", and he retained Ariosto's title as part of his own. We may fairly conclude that in the shaping of his book he wished to do justice to the shaping of Ariosto's poem as he understood it. No doubt, it is also a fair assumption that Harington wished to dress his book in the best contemporary Italian manner—to be sophisticated and up-to-date. Here, however, he was less successful. Considering together the nineteen plates that appear on rectos, the layout of the verse in seven stanzas to a full column instead of six, the omission of the prose allegorie at the head of each canto, the use of printer's ornaments in lieu of engraved designs in the borders for the arguments, the substitution of the sometimes troublesome "broken . . . discourse" (XVII:Moral) of annotation for commentary, and even the very choice of a folio rather than quarto format, one must acknowledge that Harington's book is a more thrifty production than Franceschi's—however lavish it must appear compared with other contemporary English books of poetry. Certain design problems were less successfully resolved in his book, and indeed, in one respect, the design of Harington's book was already out-of-date when it appeared in 1591, for in the previous year the Italian publisher Bartoli had brought out an edition of Tasso, also modelled on Franceschi's Ariosto, but with the design modified so that all the plates were made to face the canto-beginnings (Mortimer, no. 494). Of contemporary and early seventeenth-century English books, only Speght's Chaucer of 1598 and 1602 and Sandys' Ovid of 1632 may possibly owe certain features of their design to Harington's example. To what extent—finally—should a modern edition follow the 1591 design? I hope I have shown that McNulty's edition, admirable though it is in giving us an entire version of the text (poem and apparatus) and in reproducing all the plates, nevertheless obscures Harington's meaning in certain small but crucial ways by failing to respect his design-intentions. The arrangement, typography, layout, and ornament, are all freely altered. His edition has been much discussed recently, but the question of book-design has not been seen to be part of the editorial problem, and it is worth considering what design-treatment of a modern edition would best fulfil Harington's intentions. Not, I suggest, a facsimile reproduction: Harington wished his book to be read and enjoyed. A re-set edition is called for, and let us assume (for argument's sake) that it will be in two volumes in paperback. There is room for considering a variety of design-treatments, but this is what I would recommend. The sequence of the contents from start to finish should be respected. The typography should follow the 1591 edition in its use of roman and (a calligraphic) italic, and in making appropriate discriminations in type-size, but the verse might well be in the same size of type as the arguments and the notes smaller. The page-layouts would necessarily be different from those Harington refers to in his text. The ornament of a paperback edition would need to be modest, but present; in particular, it should follow the system in Harington's book of an alternating pattern in the ornament of the canto-beginnings, with a change of step at Book XXIV. The small page-size of a paperback edition would probably make it impossible to reproduce the English engravings; the most appropriate substitute would be the small Giolito woodcuts, which Harington is known to have borrowed for the Bodleian Library manuscript. Some, no doubt, might argue that the proposed treatment would result in a mere pastiche, a guess-work adaptation from an imaginary Elizabethan quarto; but I believe it would be closer to the spirit of Harington's enterprise than a plain text. Moreover, it would be fun to read, and books ought to promise the reader fun. In all this, we need to remember what Greg well knew, and what any poet or playwright knows, that the substance of literary invention lies in the " Idea or fore-conceite of the work, and not in the work it selfe". 36 An editor's duty is to communicate that " Idea or fore-conceite" as fully and as faithfully as he can. His procedures will be determined by the particular circumstances of each case, and may according to those circumstances require close adherence to a single model or radical reconstruction from diverse sources. Among the sources that need to be considered is the design of the printed editions (or, for that matter, of a carefully-prepared presentation manuscript—but that is another story); and editorial treatment of what we may call the "accidentals" of book design needs to be informed by the same good sense, rational method and historical understanding as we expect in the procedures of textual criticism.</field>

The allegory is finally got in at Book XI. 11 The advertisement describes the preface as having been written "generally in defence of poemes, and specially of this present worke". However, I believe the preface was always in three parts, not two, and that additions and consequential deletions were made in the third part after the unbound sheets or gatherings were circulated among Harington's friends. See a marginal reference at XIV:16, which leads nowhere, for evidence of the deletion, and the third part of the preface itself for evidence of the addition. The references in the index are to page numbers, not canto and stanza numbers; in the advertisement, the list of tales is said to show the reader "where to begin and end" but the printed list gives only the beginnings. 12 Cited from Gaskell, p. 24, where there is also a photograph of the manuscript passage. A study of Harington's expressed and implied views about "heroical" verse leads me to think that Puttenham was in Harington's estimation an ally like Sidney, not an opponent, however unsatisfactory he may have found parts of both men's treatises. See T. G. A. Nelson, "Sir John Harington as a Critic of Sir Philip Sidney", Studies in Philology , 67 (1970), 41-56. 13 Harington's copy of the 1584 Franceschi edition must have lacked the proper plate for Book XXXIV; for an explanation of this defect (found also in other copies), see Roberto Ridolfi, "L' "Orlando Furioso" del 1584 e una sua singolarità tipografica", La Bibliofilia , 54 (1952), 92-96. Harington supplied the defect by having Plate XXXIV copied for his own book from the Valgrisi edition. 14 H. S. Bennett, English Books and Readers 1558 to 1603 (1965), p. 300, and the reference there cited. 15 I suspect, without much in the way of evidence, that the first reader, or hearer, of Harington's work in progress was usually his wife Mall, and that the translation was in many small ways adjusted to her tastes. See (for example) XIII: History, where the praise of the " education of children " attributed to " my Author " is in fact a quotation from a passage of Harington's own composition, interpolated in the text. 16 Much of the general allegory is a close and unacknowledged translation of Bononome's "Allegoria" printed in the Franceschi edition, but modified to suit its position at the back of the book and to bring the interpretations more into line with those of Harington's end-of-canto notes (Spevak, chapter 6). 17 Ludovico Ariosto: A Preface to the "Orlando Furioso" (1974), pp. 54-55; see also, for example, R. M. Durling, The Figure of the Poet in Renaissance Epic (1965), especially chapter 5; Orlando Furioso (The Frenzy of Orlando) . . . tr. Barbara Reynolds (1975-77), II, 7-18; and William Nelson, "From 'Listen, Lordings' to 'Dear Reader'", University of Toronto Quarterly , 46 (1976/77), 110-124. 18 Brand (p. 136) writes pertinently that "The mere suspension of the excitement would, however, have little significance for the reader , who has only to turn the page, were it not for a deliberate pause the poet enforces on him in the opening stanzas of the next canto. The proemio , like the congedo , was a natural device of the oral poet for welcoming his audience and setting the context of his narration". 19 Book XXXII, where the proeme is on the chopping and changing of narrative threads. That Harington was well aware of this departure from the norm may be inferred from his translation of the congedo of Book XXXI: But how sweet wordes did turne to bitter blowes, The next booke sauing one, the sequell showes. Ariosto merely defers his story to " un' altra volta ". 20 Cf. McKenzie's discussion (pp. 112-116) of Congreve's use of neo-classical scene-division in his 1710 Works . 21 Enid T. Falaschi, "Valvassori's 1553 illustrations of Orlando furioso : the development of multi-narrative technique in Venice and its links with cartography", La Bibliofilia , 77 (1975), 227-251 (quotation from p. 236). 22 McNulty (p. xliii) understates the case when he writes that "rarely does more than a suggestion seem evident", and so does Mrs Falaschi when, in order to correct earlier critics' errors, she writes that Porro probably "took little note of the content of the woodcuts" (p. 248). 23 "Illustrated editions of 'Orlando Furioso' . . .", in Fragonard: Drawings for Ariosto; with Essays by Elizabeth Mongan, Philip Hofer and Jean Seznec (1945), pp. 27-40. 24 Enid T. Falaschi, "Notes on some illustrations for Ariosto's Orlando Furioso ", La Bibliofilia , 75 (1973), 175-188, gives a thorough comparison of the English plates with their sources. 25 Porro's two glaring errors are in Plate VIII, where Melissa and Astolfo fly away from Alcina's island on a horse, not on the hippogriff, and in Plate XII, where Orlando should be shown with sword drawn (not lance in rest) and should be pursuing the phantasm of a knight riding a great horse (not a " Gigante ")—Porro must have failed to refer back across the canto-divide to the last few stanzas of canto XI. 26 E.g. Book V:1 mn, " Looke more at large in the end of the booke of this morall ", where we read, " The verie beginning being as it were a morall of it self, were sufficient for the point it treats of without any more speech to that purpose: but because the matter is such as cannot be too much spoken of, namely to perswade men to concord in matrimonie, I must needs adde a word or two thereof ". His " word or two " takes up twenty-one lines. 27 Harington's use of the prose allegorie in the Valvassori edition, primarily for his notes on the moral, has been established by Spevak, pp. 122-130. 28 See, for example, Books VII, IX, XII, XVIII, XXIII, XXVII, XXVIII, XXX, XLVI; and others where the illustrated stanzas are in the first seven stanzas of a canto but where the plate is overleaf. 29 Judging (that is) by the editions I have seen: two Valgrisi editions of 1568 and 1587 held by Auckland Public Library, and microfilm of the 1584 Franceschi edition (a British Library copy, shelf-mark 79 K 12). 30 These notes are also, by the way, the most striking example of literary pressure affecting the design of the book. The lengthy historical notes take up most of nearly four pages and (unusually) they are keyed by marginal references to the stanzas discussed in them paragraph by paragraph. An instruction to the printer reads: "Yow must quote the numbers by the sydes, as I have donne in the story". 31 These are also cantos where one observes a catchword in lieu of a signature appearing on a recto (Z3; Book XXXII); headpieces incorrectly arranged for the argument borders (Y6v, 2A6, 2C2v, 2D6, 2F2v; Books XXXII, XXXIV, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL); and a factotum used in lieu of initial 'F' of the proper foliated series (2D6; Book XXXVIII); judging, that is, by the copy in the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington. 32 Sir Walter Greg plausibly suggested that the word "yow" may have been trimmed in binding after the word "have". 33 That is one explanation. Another might be that Harington somehow miscalculated the length of the notes to Book XXIII and would have tolerated Plate XXIV on the recto following his "spare leafe"; but I doubt it. 34 Review of McNulty's edition, Times Literary Supplement (6 October 1972), 1195-96; the reviewer is anonymous, but see also D.

      <field name="heading_text">Marginal Markings: The Censor and the Editing of Four English Promptbooks by T. H. Howard-Hill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sixteen promptbooks survive of plays written for the public theatre in England before 1640. 1 One cannot overestimate the importance of these manuscripts for the understanding of Renaissance dramatic texts. In the England of Shakespeare's time plays were written not so much as a literary expression of ideas and experiences which the playwright could communicate in no other form but more as fairly conventional vehicles for cultural commonplaces, and were purveyed in public theatres for all who could afford the price of admission. The best modern analogy is not with 'art' theatre but with television situation comedies and the like; only in its decadence did Elizabethan drama claim the status of art. An author's manuscript—or more often, a transcript of a play written collaboratively by a group of playwrights—was merely the raw material of the theatre. It was adapted to the needs of the acting company by its book-keeper, whose function in the company of actors was in some ways analogous to that of the modern director. He added notes of necessary properties, and removed superfluous mutes and characters, reallocated speeches as necessary, and cut passages unsuitable for stage presentation or the abilities of the company. 2 He cast minor roles in light of the company's personnel and supervised the rehearsals of the play with the aid of the 'book' (a technical term) from which he had prepared the 'plot' of the play and the actors' 'parts'. Into the book were entered any other adjustments which rehearsal revealed to be necessary. If the playwright was also an actor—as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were for a time—no doubt the book received authorial variants from revision during rehearsal. Consequently, the printed textual tradition of Renaissance plays has two main stems, one which proceeds from authorial drafts ('foul papers') and fair copies, the other from the theatrical promptbooks which recorded what happened to the text in performance. Not surprisingly, there are significant verbal differences between, say, the 1604-5 quarto text of Hamlet , which originated from the author's foul papers, and the 1623 First Folio text which was printed either from a transcript of the promptbook or a copy of the quarto collated with the promptbook. 3 Some 1015 titles of plays are recorded in the Harbage-Schoenbaum Annals of English Drama between 1576, when the first English theatre was built in London, and 1642, when the theatres were closed, a number so disproportionate to the sixteen extant promptbooks that it is not difficult to comprehend the intense scrutiny to which the promptbooks are subjected. 4 Four of the sixteen promptbooks carry evidence of the censorial attentions of Sir George Buc, who, as Master of the Revels between 1603 and 1622, was encharged with the task of ensuring that the plays presented at court and played in public were free from matter offensive to the governing authorities or to public order. 5 They are: (1) The First part of Richard II ( Woodstock ), written c. 1592 but censored later, probably on the occasion of a revival; (2) Charlemagne , c. 1604; (3) The Second Maiden's Tragedy , 1611; and (4) Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt , 1619. The manuscripts have been edited diplomatically in the Malone Society Reprint series over a span of seventy years, yet, remarkably, little attention has been given to Buc's influence on them or, by implication, on other plays printed between 1603-22 for which manuscript evidence does not survive. 6 This neglect may perhaps be explained by the modern editorial history of one of them, The Second Maiden's Tragedy , which it is my purpose in some part to correct. When the Malone Society was founded in 1906 by a group of prominent English scholars which included E. K. Chambers, A. W. Pollard and R. B. McKerrow, W. W. Greg was appointed Honorary Secretary and General Editor. He exercised the second function until 1939, with consequences for the scholarship of early English drama which have yet to be thoroughly appreciated. 7 In that period were gathered the first fruits of an achievement which justifies his description as the greatest editor of English literature of this century; his contribution to bibliography, textual criticism and editing requires no amplification here. Nevertheless, the Malone Society edition of The Second Maiden's Tragedy "prepared by the General Editor" and issued in 1910 is not impressive as a harbinger of Greg's later achievements. The introduction is so brief that it does not discuss topics like watermarks which are customarily described in such introductions and there were, despite Greg's disclaimers, an unusually large number of misreadings in an edition which purported to represent the original manuscript exactly. 8 More serious, and particularly significant for analysis of the censor's role in the evolution of the dramatic text, was that Greg disregarded completely a whole set of markings in the margin of the manuscript. Greg's fastidiousness about the attribution of alterations in the manuscript was criticised shortly after the publication of the Malone Society edition by Watson Nicholson whose own edition of the play had been forestalled (" The Second Maid's Tragedy," MLN 37 (1912), 33-37). Pointing out that The Second Maiden's Tragedy is "the first licensed play in England of which we have the original manuscript and license [for performance]" (p. 33), Nicholson drew attention to a number of crosses in the margin, some like the letter "x," some like the "+" mark. Sometimes the cross is a blue pencil mark, sometimes it is ink—and usually the two appear together as though some one had first gone over the play and called attention to certain passages by one sign, and another followed using his own mark to attract attention (p. 23). Although his description of the crosses is not exact and his analysis of the process by which they were placed in the margins of the manuscript is incorrect, Nicholson performed a valuable service by mentioning the pencil crosses. "No one", he remarked, ". . . has ever before called attention to these blue pencil crosses" (p. 36) and, indeed, Greg's diplomatic edition is completely silent about them. 9 This is the more remarkable because one of the facsimiles he provides has a pencil cross quite visible next to an ink cross on f. 55 v . His blindness was wilful. In his response to Nicholson, Greg ( MLN 29 (1914), p. 125) replied: "There are no blue pencil marks in the manuscript that I can see. There are a number of marks in ordinary lead pencil—obviously the work of some modern reader or editor." It is not edifying to see an editor of Greg's maturity (he was aged 39 in 1914) take refuge in a quibble about the shade of pencil and then deny the significance of markings he had completely ignored before by attributing them to modern sources—without investigation, as if the crosses were of a single kind, and as if he had some scientific means to distinguish early twentieth-century from early seventeenth-century pencil. His first responsibility as the editor of a diplomatic text was to see what was in the manuscript, margins and all; the second surely was to communicate his observations to readers who, through distance from the British Museum, might not have had an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies of the edition by firsthand examination of the manuscript. For all that he mentioned one instance of a pencil cross in the discussion of the manuscript several years later in Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses (1931), the currency of the diplomatic edition was so wide, and Greg's reputation so persuasive as to the accuracy of the edition, that it is easy to believe that appropriate consideration of Sir George Buc's influence on the drama of his time was hindered rather than aided by his treatment of the marginal markings. Neglect of pencil markings in SMT may seem trivial by comparison with the plenitude of textual data and observation which was supplied by the Malone Society edition. In fact, that edition omits mention of 17 crosses and 3 marginal lines and underscorings, and the diplomatic editions of the three other promptbooks—all supervised by Greg—are silent about another 49 pencil marks. 10 It is reasonable to assume that the modern editors whom Greg held responsible were equally attentive to the remaining twelve promptbook manuscripts, yet only two of them show traces of pencil at all. The Honest Man's Fortune has a single word added marginally in pencil in modern handwriting. The Book of Sir Thomas More —probably the most studied of all the promptbooks, on account of its Shakespearian associations—contains 27 instances of the use of pencil (10 unremarked by Greg in his Malone Society edition of 1911), most of which are apparently recent additions. 11 Although the small apparently modern crosses in Sir Thomas More occur occasionally in SMT and other manuscripts, there is no instance even in the exceptionally heavily pencilled More manuscript of the kind of pencil crosses found in the four promptbooks associated with the censor, Buc. 12 Both in extent of pencil markings and in the kind of marking, therefore, the Buc manuscripts are exceptional. In 1978 The Second Maiden's Tragedy was meticulously edited in modern spelling for the Revels Plays series by Professor Anne Lancashire, who provided an independent scholarly examination of the manuscript which went far to correct the omissions of Greg's edition. 13 The pencil markings were recorded and taken account of in a separate discussion, "Marginal ink and pencil crosses" (pp. 280-281), where it was mentioned that "occasional marginal square ink crosses and pencil crosses occurring together and separately, seem related to textual censorship and have been tentatively attributed . . . together with the censorship alterations they generally accompany, to the censor Sir George Buc." Professor Lancashire concluded, however, that "it is unsafe to make an attribution to Buc of any censorship change simply because it is accompanied by one or more such crosses" (p. 281). On the contrary: pencil and ink together are sure signs of Buc's censorial attentions. Her argument was simply one of uncertainty, about the variety of forms of crosses, about their origins, and about their functions. It runs as follows: Charl. and Wdstk . . . . have no known connection with Buc apart from these crosses, . . . Furthermore Wdstk. contains a number of ink and pencil crosses which are not related to censorship; and, of the three cross-marked deletions . . . that are usually held likely to be Buc's work, at least two . . . are very doubtfully censorship changes at all. The one Charl. alteration attributed to Buc, with its pencil and ink crosses, could have been by the stage reviser of the MS; other pencil crosses in the MS do not seem to be Buc's. . . . Finally, some pencil marks in extant corrected MSS may even be modern; and in S.M.T. , at least, where pencil and ink crosses occur together the ink has preceded the pencil. [Further] . . . other correctors, original or modern, could also make crosses, for a variety of reasons (including, presumably, censorship). . . . In its way, this is as distressing a refusal to confront evidence critically as Greg's refusal to acknowledge the possibility that the pencil crosses might be worth recording. Nearly every individual statement is correct; one is completely wrong, but the tendency of the argument is to show that nothing can ever be known from the evidence of the crosses. The conclusion is completely wrong. By lumping all crosses together the Revels editor could make statements which are ostensibly correct but are in fact untrue or substantially irrelevant to the crosses which are Buc's. The correct conclusion is that the marginal crosses—both ink and pencil—are the censor's, and, surprisingly, an editor has greatest grounds to be confident in the identification of the ink crosses and the proximate cause of textual alterations when they are accompanied by pencil marks. The more informal, occasional evidence gives weight to the formal and permanent marks of the censor's influence on the text. The singlemost important observation about the crosses is that they fall into several distinct categories; not only pencil or ink, but small and large, square or slanted. Once separated on the basis of form, they can be examined in terms of function. The small slanted crosses have no apparent effect on the received text; they may be categorised as 'modern' and set aside. Since they are not peculiar to SMT , as I have noticed (note 11) their origin from the hand of a modern editor should not be too difficult to trace. Other small crosses are associated with corrections in the text. It was common for writers at this time to place small crosses in the text to mark corrections or to indicate the correct place of inserted material, and to make a correction or insertion in the margin, with the cross repeated. SMT gives an example at 1. 2, associated with a censorial correction, which deserves closer attention. The only other kind of cross in SMT is large and square. It is necessary to attribute this form to Sir George Buc, for the following reasons: (1) the crosses are consistent in form; this indicates a common origin; 14 (2) they are found only in 4 promptbooks which contain censorial alterations; in two ( SMT., Bar. ) of the manuscripts Buc is specifically identified as the source of textual corrections; 15 (3) the pencil crosses are associated with ink crosses which are formed in the same manner, and the ink of the crosses is the same as that in which four textual alterations by Buc were made; 16 (4) finally, and to my mind conclusively, the pencil markings in the 4 promptbooks are paralleled by similar markings in Buc's two surviving holograph manuscripts. The main portion of Buc's Commentary upon the New Roll of Winchester (Bodleian ms. Eng. misc. b. 106) was written in 1614 and revised through 1621. It was very much a work in progress and exhibits a fascinating repertoire of marks of deletion, cancellation, insertion, annotation, reference and comment. Most of these are in ink, but pencil occurs often enough to reveal the manner in which Buc employed it. 17 More informative than a mere summary of the marks Buc used in the Commentary , two passages where pencil was used foreshadow events in the dramatic manuscripts. Folio 21 is an inserted slip of waste paper from the Revels Office made up of two pieces of paper pasted together, the first strip bearing eleven lines, the second three lines of text. The sequence of the corrections need not be determined now although a mere record of the alterations makes that clear enough. Opposite l. 2 there is a faint pencil cross in the right margin and in the following line "anmacro 18. Ed.1" shows 1 changed to 2 in pencil. In the right margin opposite l. 4, "20 libr " is written in pencil and the gloss in the line above is altered in ink to " xx.l.i. " Even more instructive to show how Buc used his pencil is an instance on f. 26 v . Upon completing the recto Buc inadvertently reversed the leaf so that the writing on the verso would run from the bottom to the top of the page when the leaf was bound in place. He discovered this after he had written two thirds of the verso and, loath to rewrite the recto as well, on the correct top half of the verso he put a pencil cross and wrote " Renvurser " opposite it. To make his intention quite clear he added " Neville " and " Latimer " between brackets above the cross in the top lefthand corner of the leaf. All these additions are in pencil. Later he pasted blank paper over the upside-down text and recopied his manuscript—not without variation—over the pencil markings in proper form. 18 It is quite clear from the Commentary that Buc used pencil in a manner familiar to writers of later ages, as an easy, informal working tool, for records which were temporary or provisional. This impression is confirmed by its appearance in his History of the Life and Reign of Richard the Third (B.L. ms. Cotton Tiberius E.x) which is roughly contemporary with the Commentary . 19 To anticipate, it is also characteristic of the way in which the censor read a play submitted for license, pencil in hand, marking passages of text which required closer consideration and, often, the confirmation of additional marks or corrections in ink. There is no need to deal further with this manuscript or, indeed, with Buc's use of pencil in general. Notwithstanding the weight of the evidence which identifies the pencil markings with Buc, one may contemplate the possibility that someone else, perhaps the Clerk of the Revels, marked up the plays in pencil in order to draw passages to Buc's attention and final disposition. However, that not-unreasonable notion cannot hold in the light of one passage in SMT. At l. 708, servant was pencilled in the right margin by Buc who also, presumably, underscored frend in the text; in this instance, there is a cross, a mark in the text, and an alteration in Buc's handwriting, all in pencil and all together. 20 Furthermore, this instance is particularly valuable in revealing the influence of the censor on the text which was eventually performed on the stage. That Buc was troubled by the passage in which Helvetius urges his daughter, the Lady, to allow him to select her lover appears from his alteration of "friend" to "servant" and his addition of another marginal cross beside l. 712 (II.i.76); he also drew a pencil line in the right margin from l. 699 to l. 730. Apparently as a result of the censor's intervention the corrector substituted "woman" for "courtier" in l. 712, and ll. 715-24 (to "forgotten") were marked for omission and crossed out in ink which is possibly that of the substitution. Editors can understand the relationships amongst the markings only when the marginal crosses and the marginal servant are correctly identified as Buc's. The only refuge for anyone who wished to deny that Buc was responsible for the pencil crosses would lie, it seems, in the Revels editor's claim that "in S.M.T. , at least, where pencil and ink crosses occur together the ink has preceded the pencil." 21 In the event, a footnote reveals that in only one (l. 1425) of the three places with both pencil and ink crosses does "Examination of the MS with a microscope [show] this to be the case definitely." Nevertheless, one case is enough. However, brief reflection on the physical properties of graphite and ink, or recollections of early schooldays, bring to mind that the materials are not sympathetic. The colouring matter of the ink either coheres temporarily to the surface of the graphite (where it is thick enough to be impermeable), the fluid being absorbed in the adjacent paper, until it dries and flakes off the surface on which it has no natural site, or, on the other hand, the particles of colouring pass through a lightly-drawn pencil line and are absorbed in the paper beneath. In either circumstance the pencil appears to be superior and, on that account, posterior to the ink. The more the magnification of the microscope is increased, the greater becomes the apparent separation of the two writing materials. The independent opinion of Dr. N. J. Seeley, the head of the Department for Archaeological Conservation and Materials Science, Institute of Archaeology, University of London, supports the above description of the pencil/ink relationship. 22 By this point a case has been made that the pencil markings in the margins of SMT have a bearing on the history of the manuscript itself and of the text it contains. When the appropriate reservation of certain distinctive 'modern' crosses is made, that Buc was responsible for the significant pencil markings in SMT and the other three promptbooks can scarcely be doubted, even though the unavoidable exigencies of space do not permit the case to be made—particularly for the other manuscripts—in complete fullness. The particular fashion in which Buc employed pencil and the local effects of its use are perhaps of more special interest to dramatic historians and to later editors of the four plays. Certainly the topic of his influence on the text and performance of the plays is too large and complicated to be entered into here, involving as it does scrutiny of the whole range of the means by which the censor made his requirements known to those who submitted texts for his approval. Nevertheless, one cannot relinquish all this marginal pother without one illustration of the advantage an editor may obtain from knowing the source of the pencil crosses. It is doubly instructive to examine an instance which is not wholly characteristic of the censor. Tyrant Thus hie my lordes, yo r powers and constant loues A senate | +have fixt our glories lyke vnmoued starrs +haue ___| that know not what it is to fall or err, Opposite the first speech of SMT is a largish, square pencil cross, smeared for deletion, with the crossbar extended to touch have , the first word of the verse. Above have to the left is a smaller ink cross in the ink used by the corrector of the text. (Greg who thought he was "almost certainly the author" named him C whereas the Revels editor who thought he was merely a corrector called him A.) The original reading was hath ; the corrector converted it to have by writing v over the th and adding e at the end. In the right margin, with a similar cross and in the same ink and hand, is added haue . The marginal pencil cross is not in Buc's usual form in having an extended crossbar but another instance is the next cross to occur in the manuscript. It is used on f. 30 v to point to the obvious omission of a line (l. 192) subsequently interlined by the scribe. Three instances of this style of cross in Buc's Commentary (f. 354 v ) confirm it as his. The sequence of events at once becomes clear. On starting to read through the manuscript the censor was immediately struck by what seemed to him to be an error of agreement and drew attention to it with the extended cross. Later, the corrector—who did not have the Revels editor's knowledge that hath was "an old form of the third person pl., present indicative" (p. 89)—altered the word to have . He botched the job. He needed to start the downstroke of the v (which he preferred to u for this purpose) so it would obscure the t beneath, but he began too far leftwards, thus prompting the Revels editor (but not Greg) to read ha've . By the time hath was converted to have it was pretty well illegible so the corrector added the ink cross and wrote the correct reading legibly to the right of the text. 23 At a later stage Buc's pencil cross was smeared for deletion. The Revels editor prints the original hath because in her view the corrections lack authority; Greg presumably would have printed the corrected reading in a modernized edition. Another editor, however, observing how the censor patently influenced the author to change from a less common to a more common construction, might well decide that the author's first intentions were best. From such marginal trivialities are editions constructed.</field>

Greg, Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses (1931), p. 370. 2 It is not necessary to distinguish the roles of the book-keeper and the shadowy 'stage-reviser' in this connection. 3 Recent studies of the relation between Q2 and F Hamlet urge a return to the earlier view (see W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare [2nd ed. 1951], p. 186) against the notion of dependence of F on a copy of Q2 (see W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio [1955], p. 427). In each view, however, promptbook influence is significant to explain the textual differences between Q and F. 4 The count excludes items characterized as Latin plays "for acting in schools", entertainments, masks, tilts, royal receptions, dialogues, monologues, shows, civic pageants, jigs, hoax shows, improvisations, farces, dramatic festivals, barriers and Cornish mysteries, most of which were marked as "closet plays," "Unacted" or "Privately acted" by such groups as "Strollers in Yorkshire", "Apprentices", "Tradesmen", "Chapel players", "Amateurs", "Henrietta's maids" at places which indicate private performance ("Ely House", "Kendal Castle", "Red Bull", "Inner Temple", "Essex House" and "Syon House") or are outside London. 5 Buc's uncle, Edmund Tilney, was Master until around 1609; Buc was assigned reversion of the office in 1603 but when he actually started to assist Tilney is not known (Mark Eccles, "Sir George Buc, Master of the Revels", in Thomas Lodge and other Elizabethans , ed. Charles J. Sisson [1933], p. 434). Buc was insane in March, 1622 (Eccles, p. 481) and unable to perform his functions. 6 The First Part of the Reign of King Richard the Second or Thomas of Woodstock , ed. Wilhelmina P.

Tannenbaum, "Textual errors in the Malone Society's The Second Mayden's Tragedy", PQ , 9 (1930), 304-306 listed 105 "mistakes" from examination of photostats of the manuscript, a number Greg could readily reduce to 21 "genuine errors" ( ib. , 10 (1931), 30-32), of which "not more than four are of any consequence. . . . I should have expected more, and I do not think that subscribers . . . have any cause for complaint." 9 Greg notes that "servant" was added in pencil in the margin at l. 708, to the right, but he ignores the pencil cross at l. 707 (left margin) and before "frend" in 1. 708, and the pencil underscoring of "frend", which were all noticed by the Revels Plays editor (see note 13 below). 10 Frijlinck's Barnavelt aimed to reproduce the original manuscript "with strict fidelity on the principles followed in the publications of the Malone Society" (p. xii). The editor acknowledged Greg's service in "checking the proofsheets with the manuscript" (Preface); nevertheless, 38 pencil markings were ignored. 11 " The Honest Mans Fortune "; a critical edition of ms. Dyce 9 (1625) , ed. Johan Gerritsen (Groningen: 1952), f. 163 v , l. 143. The Book of Sir Thomas More , ed. by W. W. Greg (Malone Society Reprints, 1911) omits pencil at τ889-94, τ913, τ920, τ939-45, τ990-5, 10, 157-62, 171-6, 210 (f. 13 v ), and 73. 12 Crosses at the ends of text lines in More which are apparently modern ( cf. ll. 203, 544, 26, 145, and others) resemble some in SMT (ll. 311, 572, 1767) and in The Faithful Friends (Victoria and Albert museum Dyce ms. 10) at ll. 775, 782, 1851, 1920 and 1948. By "modern" I mean "added in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries" although the former is more likely. Modernity may be assumed because the crosses do not relate in any way to the processes by which a manuscript was prepared for the stage but seem, rather, to relate to the preparation of an edition or study of the manuscript. 13 The Revels edition records all the pencil marks (see "Pencil marks on ms.", pp. 273-274) except for the faint, possibly erased, cross in the left margin at 1. 380 (I.ii.110), the large pencil cross, perhaps smeared, in the left margin at 1. 1817 (IV.iii.77), and pencil lines through the text at ll. 699-730 (II.i.65-94) and 754-6 (II.i.115-117). 14 Buc's crosses can be examined in facsimiles printed in MSR Charlemagne (f. 127), MSR and Revels SMT (f. 55 v ) and Frijlinck's Barnavelt (f. 23) and Dramatic Documents (f. 23 v ). The crosses were made by the pencil forming the downstroke first and then moving, often with a faint connection (as at SMT 1354, 1841) or tail (as at SMT 1425, 1446) to draw the crossbar from left to right. They occur in SMT at ll. 2, 192, 268, 380, 707, 712, 1354, 1385, 1425, 1546, 1817, 1840, and 2403. 15 It is not my purpose to assert that because Buc inserted a marginal cross, accompanying corrections must necessarily be by him; that would be most improbable. Buc's function was to point to text requiring amendment, not to reform it himself. Accordingly it cannot be an objection to the identification of the crosses as Buc's that corrections were not made, or, if made, were not in his hand. 16 They occur in Charlemagne , l. 2420; SMT , l. 2403, and Barnavelt , ll. 2346 and 2445. 17 Pencilled instructions for colouring the blazons are in the hand of Roger Hill (d. 1667), a baron of the Exchequer, who was a later owner of the manuscript. See R. C. Bald, "A Manuscript Work by Sir George Buc", PMLA , 30 (1935), p. 2. 18 Renvurser is obscured by ink overwriting and my reading may be inexact. OED records the verb "Renverse" to mean "to reverse, turn upside down", and the adjective is an heraldic term. One cannot be certain that the cross was written before the names. 19 Two of the scraps of paper from the Revels Office on which Buc wrote his history bear dates in 1615 and 1619. Folio 3 v of the Commentary is written over a cancelled draft of a titlepage prepared for the History .—Pencil may be seen on folios 18 v , 19, 20, 33 v , 34, 44, 44 v , 45, 46, 46 v , 47 et sequ . in curly brackets, sometimes crossed, as on ff. 48, 48 v , 49, 50 v , 53 v , and 62. A bracket and a separate asterisk in pencil occur on f. 19. Pencil crosses may be seen on ff. 33 v , 67 v , 68 and 68 v . 20 No editor appears to have noticed the small pencil cross before frend , in the same style as the left marginal cross. 21 Revels SMT , p. 281 and note 45 (p. 285). 22 "In the case of pencil and liquid ink containing few solid particles, pencil line[s] generally present little barrier to the ink which passes through to the paper, the pencil line then appearing to lie on top."

      <field name="heading_text">"Sallied Flesh" (Q1, Q2): Hamlet I.ii.129 * by G. V. Monitto</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whether "sallied," "solid" (F), or "sullied" appropriately qualifies Hamlet's "flesh" continues to arouse controversy. Recently, a modern emendation, "sullied," has again been proposed, in an argument including the view that Shakespeare would not have chosen "solid," because flesh in Christian terms is always seen as frail. 1 "Sallied," however, occurring in both of the texts (Q1, 1603; Q2, 1604/5) nearest to a performance date (1600/1), including the favored basic copy-text (Q2), has been shown by F.T. Bowers to have already comprised Renaissance meanings equivalent to those proposed in modern emendation. 2 In Love's Labor's Lost (Q1, 1598), for example, the Princess of France declares her honor is, "pure | As the unsallied lily" (V.ii.352). Moreover, in Patient Grissil (1603), the Marquess of Salucia warns, "Then sally not this morning with foule lookes" (I.i.12). 3 In addition, elsewhere in Hamlet itself, Polonius ascribes to his son Laertes, "slight sallies" (II.i.39), in order to render him, "As 'twere a thing a little soil'd [wi' th'] working" (l. 40). Further support for "sallied" inclusive of "sullied" exists in dictionaries and a handbook familiar to Shakespeare's audience. "Sallied" may find a cognate relative in salir (variant of sale ): "to beray, soile, or foule," cited in Claudius Holliband's (or Claude de Sainliens) A Treasurie of the French Tong (London, 1580), and cited in the same compiler's A Dictionarie French and English (London, 1593). 4 " Sallie ," moreover, is an adjective cited in Randle Cotgrave's influential A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (First edn., London, 1611). " Sallie " comprises the meanings, "fouled," "soyled," "berayed," "begrimed," "slurried," as well as "sullied." Such further evidence strongly suggests that the range of connotations implied in modern emendation could well have already been included among recognized senses of "sallied" in 1600/1.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Revisions and Repetition-Brackets in Fletcher's A Wife for a Month by Robert Kean Turner</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Fletcher's A Wife for a Month , originally performed in 1624, 1 was first published in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 where it appears as the third of the four plays in Section 6 (6F4-I2 v ). The quality of the F1 text varies considerably; routine printer's errors aside, much of it is orderly enough, but from time to time such aberrations occur as to suggest that somewhere behind the printer's copy lay an authorial draft heavily revised in some sections if not throughout. The irregular portions of the text are of exceptional interest for several reasons. They reveal Fletcher actually at work on the play, revising perhaps at the actors' behest but more likely changing his mind during the original act of composition about how the action should proceed and rewriting accordingly. Some of the revised sections contain repetition-brackets—entire or partial duplications of a line at some distance from its incorrect first appearance—a characteristic of revised texts long known of but recently not much discussed. And, since the F1 text seems to have been typeset from a scribal transcript—rather than, as one would expect, foul papers—it yields additional information about an important step between a play's first draft and its acting version. There are several instances at which with more or less clarity one can see Fletcher at work on his first draft. The most certain of these occurs in IV.ii where F1 preserves a false start followed by an amplification and new development of the same essential idea. Prior to this scene Frederick, a lustful King of Naples, finding his advances to the lovely and chaste Evanthe scornfully rejected, has maliciously ordered her to marry Valerio, her true love, on three extraordinary conditions—a month after the wedding Valerio dies, Evanthe dies a day later unless she can find another husband willing to die a month after marrying her, and, wedded though they are, Valerio cannot touch the longing bride beyond a kiss. The third condition, revealed to Valerio after the marriage but before the bridal night, is unknown to Evanthe, and Frederick hopes her frustration arising from Valerio's apparent inability to perform the conjugal duties the bride so passionately expects will throw Evanthe into his arms. IV.ii is devoted to two efforts on Frederick's part to force Evanthe's surrender. First, without much difficulty Frederick persuades Cassandra, Evanthe's pliable old waiting-woman, to become his bawd, a preparation for IV.iii, in the first part of which Evanthe, after pretending a measure of acquiescence, disdainfully rejects Cassandra's persuasions in a triumphant reaffirmation of her chaste love for Valerio. Secondly, in a piece of action preceding but obviously parallel to Evanthe's encounter with Cassandra, Frederick through threats and cajolements attempts to convert the noble Valerio into a wittol. As Evanthe does later, Valerio pretends to accede, then rises to a spirited rejection. Frederick's two interviews, the first with Cassandra and the second with Valerio, are what Fletcher finally decided to deal with in IV.ii, but the following is what stands in F1 (6H2) 2 : 1. Frederick sends Podramo, a servant, to fetch Valerio. Podramo exits. 2. Cassandra enters after line 2. She is neither addressed nor needed for the action for some forty lines. 3. In a brief soliloquy Frederick explains why he has sent for Valerio: I know he wants no additions to his tortures, He has enough for humane blood to carry, Yet I must vex him further; So many that I wonder his hot youth And high-bred spirit breakes not into fury; I must yet torture him a little further, And make my selfe sport with his miseries, My anger is too poore else. Here he comes, Valerio. Now my young married Lord, how do you feele your self? Short line [3], which is substantially duplicated by line [6], marks the original end of the passage; whether he actually wrote it or not, Fletcher evidently planned line [3] to read "Yet I must vex him further; here he comes." Because that was too curt, however, he cancelled line [3] in order a bit further to develop Valerio's situation and Frederick's motive in the succeeding lines. The word Valerio , flush right on line [8], seems to be a fragment of Valerio's entrance direction. 4. In the thirty-three line interview that follows, Frederick sarcastically asks how Valerio likes the delights of married life which Frederick's largess has opened to him. Valerio, vehement but dignified, accuses Frederick of tyranny and injustice. Valerio then exits, although no direction is provided. His exit line is "Is there not heaven above you that sees all?" [45]. This is followed by "Come hither Time, how does your noble Mistris?" (3), a line Frederick should address to Cassandra, but which, wanting a speech-prefix, seems continued to Valerio. 5. Cassandra's presence is unmotivated, yet Frederick, having recognized her at line 3, proceeds to enlist her services in the seduction of Evanthe. The interview ends with Cassandra assuring Frederick that she would never attempt Evanthe's chastity were it not that the lady's acquiescence would save the lives of the lovers. Frederick answers at line 37: Fred. For that I urge it too. (good, Sir, Cass. A little evill may well be suffered for a generall Ile take my leave of your Majesty. Exit. Enter Valerio . Fred. Go fortunately, be speedy too, here comes Valerio , Although F1 mislines, the verse scans (. . . evill | . . . Sir, | . . . fortunately, | . . . Valerio, | ). "Here comes Valerio ," of course, duplicates a part of line [8]. 6. The contest between Frederick and Valerio ensues. The opening dialogue has no counterpart in the earlier version of their encounter: Fred. . . . here comes Valerio , If his affliction have allayed his spirit My work has end. Come hither Lord Valerio , How do you now? Val. Your Majesty may ghesse, Not so well, nor so fortunate as you are, That can tye up mens honest wills and actions. This, however, is followed by Fred. You have the happinesse you ever aim'd at, The joy, and pleasure. Val. Would you had the like Sir. Fred. You tumble in delights with your sweet Lady, And draw the minutes out in deare embraces, You lead a right Lords life. Val. Would you had tryed it, That you might know the vertue but to suffer, If anger, though it be unjust and insolent Sits hansomer upon you then your scorne, Sir. Punctuation aside, these lines duplicate the opening lines of the dialogue summarized in paragraph 4 above except that the earlier version reads "live" for "lead" in line 50, "Your" for the incorrect "If" in line 52, and omits "Sir" in line 53. The subsequent seventy-nine lines of the conversation, however, differ from the earlier version. From these elements it is possible roughly to reconstruct what happened. Fletcher seems to have begun the scene with only one situation in mind, a meeting of Frederick and Valerio during which the former would be further revealed as a despicable tyrant and the latter as an honorable and courageous sufferer. The idea was weak—the incident did not advance the action, and it merely reiterated aspects of character already established—yet in pursuit of it Fletcher wrote the dialogue for the encounter. He then had a better inspiration, parallel scenes of Frederick's attempt upon Valerio's honor and of Cassandra's upon Evanthe's, but to work the latter out he needed to make Cassandra Frederick's instrument. He retained Frederick's sending Podramo for Valerio, which was still serviceable; inserted Enter Cassandra beneath these lines to show that the Cassandra section was to follow; and presumably cancelled the original Frederick-Valerio dialogue, a cancellation which was not observed. Fletcher then wrote the Frederick-Cassandra section. The fact that Frederick's first speech to Cassandra ("Come hither Time," line 3) has no prefix suggests that some lines explaining her presence may have been provided; if so, they are lost. Fletcher then revised the Frederick-Valerio interview along different lines from the first version, but he naturally salvaged what he could from it, specifically lines 46-53. The first version is quite simple in its conception: Frederick taunts Valerio ("Hast thou not found a loving and free Prince . . . that has confer'd . . . such heapes of comfort on thee?") and Valerio replies by citing Frederick's enormities (you "are growne a tyrant"; you are "a shame to nature"; you have flung away my innocent life; in denying me conjugal rights, especially when my blood was high, you are guilty of "a studied and unheard of malice"). The second version is longer and more complicated: Valerio lets Frederick believe he has won ("What should I do with that I cannot use Sir [i.e., Evanthe]?"); agrees to persuade Evanthe to become Frederick's mistress in exchange for life, honors, and wealth; maneuvers Frederick into granting permission for Valerio to seduce the Queen; and finally explodes into a violent refusal to compromise his integrity or even to believe that such inhumanity as Frederick's can exist. The second version is unquestionably more dramatic than the first. 3 A more ambiguous instance of revision is found in II.v-vi. In II.v Valerio, happy and excited as he dresses for his wedding, explains to his friends Camillo, Cleanthes, and Menallo that he is perfectly content to die at the month's end, an early death for the love of a lady like Evanthe being far preferable to the vexations of an inglorious old age. In F1 (6G3) II.v concludes and II.vi begins as follows. Valerio is speaking: Wee'l have a rouse before we go to bed friends, 47 A lusty one, 'twill make my blood dance too. Musick Cam. Ten if you please. Val. And wee'l be wondrous merry, They stay sure, come, I heare the Musick forward, 50 You shall have all Gloves presently. Exit. Men. We attend Sir, but first we must looke to'the Doores. Kn [ o ] cking within . The King has charged us. Exeunt. Enter two Servants . [II.vi] 1 Serv. What a noyse do you keepe there, call my fellowes A the Guard; you must cease now untill the King be Enter'd, he is gone to'th Temple now. 2 Serv. Looke to that back doore, and keep it fast, They swarme like Bees about it, 4 Ent [ e ] r Camillo , Cleanthes , Menallo , Tony following , and Foole following . Tony and the Fool are one and the same character. He and the three courtiers exchange twenty lines of comic dialogue mainly about the crowd seeking to press into the room where the masque will be presented. The passage concludes with "hark, the King comes" (II.vi.25; 6G3 v ), and this is followed by A Curtaine drawne . The King , Queene , Valerio , Evanthe , Ladies , Attendants , Camillo , Cleanthes , Sorano , Menallo . A Maske . Cupid descends . . . Although "hark, the King comes" implies a regular entrance, the direction is apparently for the discovery of an assembled group before which the masque will almost immediately be presented. 4 Especially remarkable is the inclusion in the group of Camillo, Cleanthes, and Menallo, who are already on stage. Listed among them is Sorano, Evanthe's despicable brother and Frederick's executive in vice, who is not. The discrepancy involving the three courtiers provides a clue to Fletcher's first intention, which must have been to send them off to the temple and have them reappear later as members of the wedding party. Originally II.v probably ended with this pentameter: You shall have all Gloves presently. Men. We attend Sir. Ex. And II.vi began with Enter two Servants . 1 Serv. What a noyse . . . . Knocking within . The exchange between the servants, which F1 mislines and terminates with a comma (line 4), may initially have been longer, but the next major development in the scene appears to have been the discovery of the wedding party and the performance of the masque, with Valerio's three friends properly members of the group. If something like this was the scene's original form, the dialogue from the entrance of the courtiers and Tony to the discovery direction (II.vi.4.1-II.vi.25) is an addition. The lines substantially repeat doorkeeping business already used to begin II.iv (6G2 v ), and they introduce no new lines of action for later development; they add to the excitement and variety of the scene, but they are essentially filler. One guesses, then, that Fletcher inserted them either to lengthen a short scene, for the masque appears to be brief, or to replace action involving the servants which he did not care for. Having done so, he should have removed the three courtiers from the wedding party. He also had to alter the end of II.v in order to get the courtiers and Tony together for the beginning of II.vi; this he managed simply by adding a pentameter line and a stage-direction—"but first we must looke to'th Doores. The King has charged us. Exeunt. " The addition displaced the marginal Knocking within and rendered the exit at line 51 redundant. Because it designates Frederick the King , the discovery direction seems to be in an early form, and it also seems that when "hark, the King comes" was written the idea of a discovery had been abandoned. 5 III.i, the scene following II.vi, involves Alphonso, Frederick's older brother, who would have been king but for a chronic and incapacitating melancholia. III.i finds him in the monastery to which he has been confined, about to pay his daily visit to the tomb of his beloved father. For this Fletcher wanted solemn spectacle; the opening direction is Enter divers Monkes , Alphonso going to the Tombe , Rugio and Frier Marco discover the Tombe and a Chaire (III. i.o.1-2; 6G3 v ). As II.vi was originally conceived, the discovery space would have been occupied from the revelation of the wedding party and the beginning of the masque through nearly the rest of the scene, there being only five lines of dialogue between the end of the masque, where the curtain might be drawn, and the end of the scene itself. If the discovery space was to be employed at the opening of III.i, it may have been awkward if not impossible both to dismantle the masque scene and to install the tomb, presumably an elaborate property, in the same area despite the time afforded by the act-interval. Thus the changes in II.v-vi may have been required to solve a technical problem pointed out to Fletcher by the actors; on the other hand, when Fletcher decided to use the discovery space in III.i, he could have rewritten II.v-vi on his own initiative. Whichever may have been the case, the discovery direction evidently remained in its original state, perhaps overlooked or perhaps left as a detail for the bookkeeper to fix up. In the first of these passages discussed, line IV.ii [6] substantially duplicates line [3], the two being close enough in meaning to constitute a repetition-bracket, and as other repetition-brackets occur elsewhere in the play it is desirable to review briefly what has been made of these textual phenomena. The term was introduced briefly and rather casually by J. Dover Wilson to give a name to the repetition of the same line in a text, the second occurrence being fairly near the first (e.g., "But what is your affaire in Elsenoure ?" Hamlet , 1603, B4:35 and B4 v :5). Wilson assumed that the material between the duplicated lines was added to the basic text, but he did not explain how or why the duplication occurred. 6 The mechanics of the repetition-bracket were first discussed by Greg, who, comparing bracketed passages in The Honest Man's Fortune as they appear in the printed text of 1647 and in the Dyce manuscript, made the important observation that such repeated lines may mark not additions but cuts. 7 He later conveniently summarized his findings: It occasionally happens that a line or part of a line occurs twice over some way apart in a scene, and that its first appearance is a patent error. . . . Such repetitions may come about in either of two ways. If an addition is to be made in a text it will be written either in the margin or on a separate slip, and the writer may add at the end of the addition, as a sort of catchword, the next few words of the original text that are to follow. [An example from The Second Maiden's Tragedy is given. See MSR , line 249 and addition slip, and Anne Lancashire, ed. 1978, I.i.240.] If, therefore, the position of the insertion were not clearly marked and a printer entered it a line or two low, we should get just such a duplication as we are considering. On the other hand if a passage is cancelled, the scribe may repeat at the head of the deletion the words at which the text is to be resumed. Then if, in printing, the cut is restored, we shall again get a repetition-bracket. . . . Thus the brackets may theoretically indicate either addition or omission; but normally, we may suppose, the latter, since in this case no misplacement need be assumed. 8 The supposition that repetition-brackets normally signal cuts influenced R. C. Bald so to interpret two of them in The Woman's Prize , one in the printed text of 1647 and the other in the Lambarde manuscript, and another in Beggars' Bush . 9 Yet more recent studies of these plays do not agree. One of the passages in The Woman's Prize and two others involving brackets unnoticed by Bald are held by Fredson Bowers to be "expanded text in the copy misunderstood by the F1 compositor"; only Bald's second instance is thought possibly a deletion. Bald's example from Beggars' Bush and another bracketed passage in that play are both believed to be additions. 10 Thus it seems that brackets may not normally indicate omissions or at least that exceptions may be as common as the rule. Indeed, as appears to be the case at IV.ii. [3-6] of A Wife for a Month , repetition-brackets may arise from an authorial cancellation not observed (or made), a literary development of the material at hand, and the reintroduction of the cancelled line or an approximation of it. 11 This variety of the repetition-bracket is perfectly illustrated by a passage in II.v which occurs shortly before the alteration to that scene just examined but does not seem related to it. Valerio has been holding forth on the delights of dying young. His peroration (6G3) is To dye a young man is to be an Angell, 42 Our great good parts, put wings to our soules: Wee'l have a rouse before we go to bed friends, * Pray ye tell me, ist a hansome Maske we have? Cam. We understand so. Val. And the young gent. dance? Cle. They do Sir, and some dance well. Val. They must before the Ladies, Wee'l have a rouse before we go to bed friends, 47 A lusty one, 'twill make my blood dance too. The repeated lines, * and 47, although they look just like the brackets discussed by Greg, cannot mark a later alteration to the text, for "'twill make my blood dance too" (line 48), which falls after the repeated line, refers to the dancing mentioned within the bracket. The entire passage must have originated as a single act of composition: after Fletcher wrote line * it occurred to him to do a little more with the masque, which had been mentioned only once before and then casually (II.iv.12;6G2 v ); he cancelled line * (imperfectly?) and composed lines 44-46; and lastly he reused line * as line 47. The bracket, then, has the same significance as the similar bracket in IV.ii, and the alteration to the text pretty clearly occurred because a new thought struck Fletcher as he wrote. Another repetition-bracket is found in III.ii. The lusty bridegroom, revelling in anticipation of the wedding night, is brought word by Sorano of a new prohibition—if Valerio makes love to his bride, she dies. At the end of the scene Sorano speaks sarcastically (6G4): All [the comfort] I have I have brought ye, And much may it do ye with it my deare Brother, 115 See ye observe it [the prohibition] well; you will find about ye Many eyes set, that shall o're-looke your actions, If you transgresse ye know, and so I leave ye, Val. Heaven be not angry, and I have some hope yet, 119 And when you please, and how allay my miseries. * Enter Frederick . To whom I kneele be mercifull unto me, 121 Looke on my harmelesse youth Angels of pitty, 120 And from my bleeding heart wipe off my sorrowes, The power, the pride, the malice and injustice Of cruell men are bent against mine innocence. You that controwle the mighty wills of Princes, 125 And bow their stubborne arm[e]s, look on my weaknesse, And when you please, and how, allay my miseries. Exit. 127 Fred. Hast thou been with him? [III.iii] Sor. Yes . . . . Here lines * and 127 establish the bracket, and because the material between them does not refer specifically to anything beyond itself one cannot at the outset tell whether it is an addition, a cut, or a change introduced during the initial stage of composition. As in II.v-vi, however, a change of plan when he reached a new scene could have caused Fletcher to modify a passage he had just completed. One may imagine that Fletcher originally ended III.ii with lines 119 and * and, intending to open III.iii upon Frederick alone, wrote Enter Frederick and perhaps a few lines of a soliloquy which did not please him. He then decided to begin III.iii with Sorano's report, but to bring Sorano on at the start of the scene created a near-violation of the law of reentry, Sorano having exited from III.ii only at line 118. The solution was to lengthen Valerio's speech, which Fletcher did by writing the lines between * and 127, like II.vi.4.1-25 primarily filler. Line * and Enter Frederick should have been cancelled, and the situation is further complicated by the transposition, perhaps compositorial, of lines 120 and 121 and, if Fletcher provided it, the omission of Enter Frederick and Sorano at the head of III.iii. 12 Sorano's "and so I leave ye" is a perfectly good exit line, yet because the line ends with a comma and the exit is unmarked it may be that the speech continued for a line or two more. As speculative as this reconstruction may be, it probably accounts for the facts more readily than postulating either a later cut or a later addition. The former would have created the reentry problem and left it unattended to; the latter would suppose that in his first draft Fletcher created the same problem and passed it by. One more repetition-bracket remains to be considered. Near the end of the play Valerio, although his life actually has been preserved, is thought by Frederick and Evanthe to have been executed, and in accordance with Frederick's earlier conditions Evanthe has twenty-four hours in which to find a new husband. In V.iii four unsuitable suitors are introduced, but their courtship is swiftly concluded when they learn the consequences of marrying the lady. Evanthe, speaking to Frederick, attempts to bring matters to an end (6I1 v ): Evan. Come, your sentence, let me dye, you see Sir, 157 None of your valiant men dare venture on me, A Moneth's a dangerous thing. Enter Valerio disguis'd . Fred. Away with her, let her dye instantly. * Evan. Will you then be willing To dye at the time prefixt, that I must know too, 160 And know it beyond doubt. Fred. What if I did wench? Evan. On that condit[i]on if I had it certaine, I would be your any thing, and you should injoy me, 163 . . . I would dye with you, but first I would so torter ye, 169 And cow you in your end, so dispise you, For a weak and wretched coward, you must end sure; Still make ye feare, and shake, dispised, still laugh at ye. Fred. Away with her, let her dye instantly. 173 Cam. Stay, there's another, and a Gentleman . . . . Lines * and 173 constitute the bracket, and, as before, there is no positive indication of the nature of the intervening lines, which could equally well be an omission to shorten the scene or an addition to lengthen it. Yet these lines too could result from a new idea's striking Fletcher as the scene took shape. Originally this segment of the action was to end with Evanthe's request for death, Frederick's angry order for her execution, and immediately upon that the entrance of the disguised Valerio. Perhaps Fletcher had written a few lines more when it occurred to him that the situation could be given one last twist. With Evanthe reduced to desperation, Frederick might try once again; he will offer to marry her, as he had previously done, but this time the marriage will save her life. And Evanthe will accept him, but only if he will agree to the terms imposed on Valerio—his own death at the month's end. This idea Fletcher developed, but in what F1 prints Frederick's proposal has been lost. Line * should have been cancelled and Valerio's entrance should have been inserted before line 174, but as was the case at the end of III.ii, the tidying-up was not done. Five examples of revision have now been examined. Two—II.v.42 ff. and IV.ii.1 ff.—seem reasonably certain to have been changes made during composition; three—II.v.47 ff., III.ii.114 ff., and V.iii.157 ff.—are less certainly, but probably, the same. All are marked by prominent irregularities in the text. It stands to reason, then, that the play contains other revisions not so marked or at least less obviously so, although in these cases the evidence may be revealing only authorial carelessness or the misinterpretation of the manuscript by some agent of transmission. In I.ii, for example, Camillo, Cleanthes, and Menallo are having the usual expository conversation about vice and corruption in the kingdom of Naples when they are interrupted by the entrance of Frederick and his henchmen. Convinced by her rejection of Frederick that Evanthe has another lover, Sorano has sent Podramo, his servant, to fetch Evanthe's cabinet, which the three will rifle for clues to Evanthe's secret. The text runs (6G1): Enter Frederick, Sorano with the Cabinet . Pod. So do I too. The King with his contrivers, 49 This is no place for us. Exeunt Lords. "So do I too" is a part of the courtiers' conversation; it and the words following probably belong to Camillo, for whose speech-prefix Podramo's has been substituted, Podramo having been dropped from the entrance direction. Later, at I.ii.103, Sorano and Podramo depart, their direction, incorrect because Podramo is a servant, being Exit Lords . The oddity is that this direction duplicates the one at I.ii.50. At V.iii.37 ff. (6I1) Frederick orders Castruchio to bring Evanthe forth "and give way To any Suitor that shall come to marry her . . . ." Castruchio exits and reenters immediately with Evanthe, the three courtiers, and Tony, the entrance being marked after line 40. After V.iii.275 (6I2), however, Castruchio again enters, although no exit has ever been provided for him. Disguised as Prince Urbino of Abydos, Valerio, as a part of a noble preliminary to claiming Evanthe's hand, mentions with respect to Valerio's supposed execution, "I have heard his fate: My Fathers had not been to me more cruell" (V.iii.219-220; 6I2); what Urbino's father had done to him, however, is nowhere revealed. The clerics who care for the melancholic Alphonso are sometimes monks and sometimes friars. The scene of the action, Naples, unaccountably becomes an island at V.iii.3 (6I1). Throughout the text entrance directions are commonly placed immediately or one line before the first speech or notice of the character. In three or four instances the directions are as many as three lines high, but in two (after III.iii.88 [6G4 v ] and after V.iii.64 [6I1 v ]) the entrances are advanced by eight lines, possibly misplaced because of insertions of material following them. All the signs examined so far point to a heavily worked-over authorial manuscript as the F1 copy, yet, as Cyrus Hoy noticed, A Wife for a Month , together with Rule a Wife and The Woman's Prize , exhibits the lowest number of Fletcher's favorite ye 's of all his unaided work, an indication that the F1 copy was not the working draft directly but a transcript of it. The scribe, Hoy thinks, was Edward Knight, who was actively employed as bookkeeper of the King's Men by 1624 and whose transcript of the Bonduca foul papers shows a considerable reduction of the ye 's present in the F1 text of that play, a derivative of the prompt-book. 13 As no comprehensive study of Knight's characteristics has as yet been made, one cannot be very definite about the identity of the scribe, but the chances are that Hoy is right. Knight would have been readily available to work for Fletcher, of course; as for more specific evidence, in A Wife for a Month "gent." stands not only for "gentleman" but also, quite uncommonly, for "gentlewoman" (II.vi.16; 6G3 v ), as it does in Knight's transcript of The Honest Man's Fortune ; 14 the spelling of off is "of" as it is in one of Knight's additions to The Soddered Citizen (MSR, line 2210), in The Honest Man's Fortune (I.i.234), and in his transcript of Bonduca (MSR, lines 487, 1336, 1560, etc.); and the spelling of too is occasionally "to" as it is occasionally in Bonduca (lines 121, 897). There is a fairly good possibility, then, that Knight copied Fletcher's draft, preserving in his rendition many of the discrepancies it contained, including duplicate versions of some sections of the text and other details indicating that while writing the play Fletcher changed his mind several times about how the action was to develop. While some of Fletcher's alterations may have baffled Knight, it looks very much as though he never set out to create a finished product; instead, he copied more or less everything he saw perhaps because nearly every word—right or wrong, redundant or not—might be useful subsequently. 15 It is apparent that the version he created could not have served as the prompt-book; it must, therefore, have been intended to furnish a reasonably clean, although unfinished, text for further revision, after which the prompt copy would be inscribed from it. And there are a few signs that alterations were made on the transcript itself. F1 renders III.ii.115 (quoted above) as "And much may it do ye with it my deare Brother," a garbling of "much good may it do ye" and "much may ye do with it." It is not likely that a scribe would have written such nonsense; the line looks more like the scramble a compositor might make of an unclear cancellation and substitution. By the time he wrote the stage-direction at II.vi.4.1-2 (also quoted above), the scribe, having met Tony in II.i and II.iv, should have known him for the play's fool. He might have taken over and Foole following from Fletcher's draft, but it would have been extraordinarily dense of him to write what F1 prints— Tony following , and Foole following . Here someone was trying to substitute Tony's personal name for his generic name, but he did it in such a way as to confuse the compositor, an indication that the alteration was made on the transcript. But one imagines that most of the changes made to the transcript would have been deletions of redundant material or the repositioning of misplaced parts, both done so as to be clear to Knight but not necessarily to the printer. 16 And it is possible, of course, that Knight, knowing what to do when he came to the prompt-book, at some points made no notation on the transcript at all. One would think Fletcher might have reviewed the transcript, but if I am right in interpreting the revisions examined here as being essentially connected with the composition of the play, Knight himself or some other member of the company could have handled them, implying that the author gave the actors an imperfect text expecting them to alter it as they chose. Such considerations must remain speculative, but the F1 text of A Wife for a Month provides a rare glimpse of a play in the making, further evidence for the existence of intermediate transcripts, and a few more details about the way the King's Men handled theatrical documents soon after the time copy was gathered for the Shakespeare First Folio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Gerald Eades Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage , III (1967), 422-425. 2 Quotations are from F1. Line numbers are those of an edition of the play in The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , genl. ed. Fredson Bowers, VI (Cambridge: CUP, forthcoming). Numbers in square brackets refer to material excluded from the text of the edition but printed in an appendix. Asterisked lines are also excluded from the text. 3 Other conceivable explanations of F1's two interviews need to be considered: (1) That both, except the passage nearly exactly duplicated, were intended to stand. F2, followed by all later editions, deals with the situation in this way, but I think it impossible not only because roughly the same territory is twice traversed but because Valerio's second appearance is unmotivated. (2) That the first version should stand, it having been written to replace the second which was thought too long. If F1's sequence of Frederick's two conversations—with Valerio, first version, and with Cassandra—is right, this will not do, for Cassandra's exit would fall at the end of IV.ii and she would immediately reenter to begin IV.iii. Possibly, however, the short version of the Frederick-Valerio interview was inserted out of order, in which case we should have Podramo sent for Valerio, the Cassandra interview, and then the Valerio interview, short version. This seems highly unlikely, however, because it severely disjoints the dialogue—Cassandra's exit would be followed unnaturally by Frederick's soliloquy (lines [1]-[8]), and after his dialogue with Valerio Frederick would have no exit speech. The reason why the rewriting seems to be a part of the original composition rather than a later revision is that were it the latter, it would follow that Fletcher initially left the scene as in (2), against which supposition the same objections may be raised. 4 On this and other discoveries managed at the Blackfriars by the drawing of a curtain, see Irwin Smith, Shakespeare's Blackfriars Playhouse (1964), p. 345. 5 In this play as in others Fletcher at first gave some of his characters generic names and did not invent personal names for them until later. I do not know at what point the King became Frederick, but the play's opening stage-direction begins Enter King Frederick , a form which suggests that Frederick may be an addition. His speech-prefixes in I.i are Fre(d) . In II.vi, however—the present scene—his two speech-prefixes are King . Tony seems to have been the Fool at first, and he remains so here and there in the play. Cassandra may originally have been Old Lady; cf. Enter Cassandra , an old Lady passing over (II.iv.50; 6G3). Similarly Castruchio, the captain of the castle, may have been Captain; he is once taken off by Exit Cap. (V.iii.39; 6I1), yet he has been addressed by his title just before. The Queen was given a personal name, but what Fletcher intended is a mystery. From I.i.181 to 218 (6F4 v -6G1) her speech-prefixes are Mar ; the name, however, is never spelled out. Some editors plausibly call her Maria . 6 "The Copy for 'Hamlet,' 1603," The Library , 3rd ser., 9 (1918), 173. As W. W. Greg points out, however, the repeated lines are here more likely to result from memorial error than from an addition ("A Question of Plus or Minus," Review of English Studies , 6 [1930], 300). 7 W. W. Greg, "Plus or Minus," pp. 300-304; rpt. in Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), 201-206. 8 The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), pp. 165-166. J. Gerritsen, ed., The Honest Man's Fortune , Groningen Studies in English 3 (1952), believes the brackets in that play to have originated with cues noted before cut passages as an aid to the scribe who was to copy parts. 9 Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont &amp; Fletcher Folio of 1647 , Supplement to the Bibliographical Society's Transactions, No. 13 (1938), pp. 80-81. 10 See Fredson Bowers, ed., The Woman's Prize in Dramatic Works , IV (1979), 11-12. Bald's passages are at II.iii.3-4 and II.iii.34; to these II.iv.85-6 and III.v.124 are added. See also Bowers, ed., Beggars' Bush , in Works , III (1976), 232-233. Bald's passage is at V.i.84-6; to this III.iv.130 is added. 11 This situation is paralleled in Beggars' Bush , where the repetition-brackets, one in F1 and one in the MS, occur because of the misplacing of revised material written on separate pieces of paper with a line of the basic text heading the revision. See Bowers, " Beggars Bush : A Reconstructed Prompt-Book and Its Copy," Studies in Bibliography , 27 (1974), 123-125. 12 That lines 120 and 121 are transposed was first pointed out by Colman in The Dramatick Works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1778), V, 308. Henry Weber in Works (1812), VIII, 189, disagrees: "Valerio kneels to Heaven, not to the angels of Heaven." Dyce in Works (1843), IX, 337, thinks Colman is right, and so do I. In line 119 Valerio means "if Heaven be not angry, I have some hope yet." He then kneels to the angels of pity who may both allay his miseries and control the wills of princes. 13 "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (I)," Studies in Bibliography , 8 (1956), 141, and Cyrus Hoy, ed., Bonduca in Dramatic Works , IV, 151-152. R. C. Bald, struck by the specification of a chair in the stage-direction at III.i.o.2, remarked, "The addition of the chair is surely due to the prompter's regard for the details of stage production, and not to the author . . ." (p. 109). His judgment was hasty: the direction is probably authorial, and there are no other signs of connection with a prompt-book. See Bentley, p. 424. 14 See Gerritsen, ed., p. cvi. 15 Regarding Knight's prompt-book transcript of Beggars' Bush as evidenced in a subsequent copy, the Lambarde manuscript, Bowers observes, "Knight made a minimum effort to exercise his personal judgment in straightening out various of the tangles in the directions and the action and was generally content to copy what he found with the addition only of directions for properties and noises" (" Beggars Bush : Prompt-Book," p. 131). 16 In the Dyce MS of The Honest Man's Fortune theatrical cuts never interfere "to any serious extent with legibility." The omission sign "usually takes the form of a vertical line either outside the speech-prefixes or between them and the text. At top and bottom this line is marked off by short rules, and where a cut begins or ends in the middle of a line a longer stroke of the pen usually shows its exact length. Occasionally light hatching is resorted to, and in the case of single line cuts a simple vertical stroke between the speech rules usually suffices" (Gerritsen, ed., pp. xx-xxi).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Neglected Bits and Pieces from the European Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recently I recalled attention, in the pages of Studies in Bibliography (35 [1982], 297), to some minor pieces, gleaned from the Gentleman's Magazine , either previously unknown or buried in obscurity. Arthur Murphy's epitaph on John Ayton Thompson, I later discovered from a footnote in John Pike Emery's biography (1946), had appeared in Daniel Lyson's The Environs of London , 4 vols., 1795, II. 205. I had looked in the index to Emery's biography and failed to find an entry for Thompson, nor was there any headnote to the Index to alert readers to the fact that matter in footnotes was not indexed. 1 I came on the footnote while pursuing other game. Possibly one or more of the following bits and pieces in the European Magazine (hereafter EM ) lurk in some obscure place; possibly some are known in their appearance elsewhere; some remain in manuscript. In this last category is Thomas Warton, the younger's, poem, "Ode On a New Plantation of flowering Shrubs in Trinity College Garden, at Oxford; the old Wilderness having been destroyed by the hard Frost 1740" (46.131-132), with a headnote, "The following Poem we have received from a friend. It is in the handwriting of its respectable Author, the late Poet Laureat, and is now printed for the first time." Thanks to the kindness of Dr. David Fairer of Leeds University I learn that the poem exists in manuscript "at Trinity College, Oxford, in the Warton MSS now on deposit in the Bodleian Library, and it was included by J. S. Cunningham in his unpublished B. Litt dissertation (Bodleian MS B.Litt d. 394-5) as poem 24." The EM version was unknown to both men.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">James Hervey From " Weston , June 28, 1746" to "Dear Mr. T----," submitted by a correspondent signing himself "W," who appends a paragraph in praise of Hervey, "a very worthy man, exemplary divine, and ingenious writer." (15.97-99). Also, from " Weston , Feb. 21, 1746" to "Dear Mr. W--" [the "W" who sent in the first letter?], submitted by "J. W.," who identifies himself as the "W" who submitted the first letter but not as the recipient of the second letter. (16.161-162). The first letter is described as "[Now First Published.]"; the second, like the first also, as an "original" letter. The recipient of the first letter probably resided "at Brynsworthy, that agreeable seat, where, three years ago, I passed several delightful weeks." Modern gazetteers describe Brysworthy as "ham.[let], N. Devon, 1½ m. S. of Barnstaple." Hervey was curate of Bideford, North Devon, for nearly three years, beginning in 1740 ( DNB ). Still in the first letter: Hervey inquires about Mr. T's last visit to the Abbey, identified in a footnote as "Stoke-Abbey, near Bideford, the seat of Paul Orchard, Esq. . .; to whom Mr. Hervey stood godfather, and dedicated the second volume of his Meditations." Hervey asks, "Is Mr. W--'s Abode in your parts," raising the suspicion that this Mr. W is the same "W" who submitted the letter. In any event, the whole letter is too long and touches on too many matters for a précis, although the recipient is identified as a clergyman with a daughter whose initials were C. I. The second letter contains far less news and is almost entirely given over to religious sentiments, largely about charity.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Samuel Johnson The "Literary Intelligence" section of the December 1783 EM concluded by reporting that "Dr. Johnson, we are happy to hear, is much better, and has sat down to put the last hand to the life of Spencer, which, with his other lives of the poets, we understand is the whole that he means to favour the literary world with" (p. 408). Hannah More wrote in her Memoirs , "Johnson told me he had been with the king that morning [in 1780], who enjoined him to add Spenser to his Lives of the Poets." 3 But Boswell, recording information given him by John Nichols, quoted the latter's saying that he rather wished that Johnson "would favour the world [so much like the EM , "favour the literary world"], and gratify his sovereign, by a Life of Spenser, (which he said he would readily have done, had he been able to obtain any new material for the purpose)" ( Life , IV. 410). Nichols's wish and Johnson's answer are unfortunately undated; hence one is unable positively to contradict the statement in the EM . In the second part of a series of "Atoms of Information" an anonymous correspondent wrote, Dr. Johnson had planned a book on the model of Robinson Crusoe. Pomponius Gauricus, a learned Neapolitan, who had dabbled in Alchemy, Physiognomy, &amp;c suddenly disappeared in the year 1530, and was heard of no more. The supposed life of this man the Doctor had resolved to write. "I will not (said he) shipwreck my hero on an uninhabited island, but will carry him up to the summit of San Pelegrini, the highest of the Appennines; where he shall be made his own biographer, passing his time among the Goat-herds, &amp;c." By Dr. Johnson's advice, the late Duke of Cumberland ordered a brass cannon to be fabricated on a new plan: Our artillery is usually complained of, on account of its weight, and size. The Doctor was willing to think these defects might in some degree be obviated; first, by casting every gun out of a less quantity of metal than usual, and afterwards by hammering it into solidity. The experiment was tried, but set aside on account of the expence attending it. Gauricus, a Neapolitan humanist, was a sixteenth-century classical scholar who also wrote on sculpture. Johnson, according to Joseph Cradock, was once in the company of Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, and if Johnson advised him on cannon, it must have been on this occasion, but the EM account, in August 1787, refers to the Duke as "the late Duke of Cumberland," whereas Henry Frederick died in 1790. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lyttelton, Chesterfield, and Jean Marishall "Letters from the Earl of Chesterfield and Lord Lyttelton to Mrs. Jane Marshall." (47.338-339). Mrs. Marshall, i.e. Jean Marishall, is identified in a footnote as "Author of 'Clarinda Cathcart,' 'Alicia Montague,' 'Sir Harry Gaylove, a Comedy,' and "A Series of Letters,' in 2 vols." She is given a bare mention in CBEL, NCBEL, Biographia Dramatica (1812), and in the catalogue of printed books of the British Library. What is of interest is that the letter by Chesterfield and the three by Lyttleton are apparently unknown, since they do not appear in the edited correspondence of either men nor in biographical works on them. Further, the references to David Garrick might lead one to assume some mention of Mrs. Marshall in his letters or in the recent (1979) full biography of him, but there is none. The letters are sufficiently interesting as to deserve full quotation. I assume the footnote appended to the fourth letter is an editorial one. No. I. MADAM, You do me a great deal too much honour, in supposing me either a competent judge or an useful patron of polite literature. From an inordinate deafness, and various infirmities that attend old age, I have been out of the world these two and twenty years: I have almost forgot it, and am quite forgotten by it. If the managers of our two theatres here had had half the pleasure in reading your comedy that it gave me, they would gladly have accepted and acted it: but they are to be considered as tradesmen, who deal in plays for profit, and who will purchase no goods but such as they think they can retail with advantage; of which they pretend to be, and perhaps are, the best judges, from long knowledge of the taste of the public; which taste is of late years so vitiated, that musical nonsense triumphs over dramatic sense. Whatever fate may attend your Comedy, you may justly have the satisfaction of knowing, that the dialogue, the sentiment, and the moral of it, do honour to a young and virgin muse. I am, with the greatest esteem, Madam, your most obedient humble servant, July 16, 1770 CHESTERFIELD. No II. MADAM, I should not have delayed so long to return you my thanks for the honour you have done me in letting me see your Play, if it had come to my hands as soon as the letter which informed me that I should be favoured with it from you; but I did not receive it till the end of last week. As you desire me to give you my judgment upon it, I can very sincerely tell you, that I think the plot interesting, the characters strongly marked, and the dialogue lively and witty, though not without faults. But experience has shown me, that to judge what will do for the stage, and succeed well in the acting, Mr. Garrick's opinion is far superior to mine: nor can I take on myself to recommend any play to him or Mr. Colman, even if it were written by the best friend I have. Pardon me therefore, Madam, for referring you to them, and particularly to Mr. Garrick; from whose decisions in these matters there can, I think, be no appeal. If I myself were to write a play, I would leave it entirely to his determination whether it should be brought on the stage or not. Permit me to assure you of my very grateful sense of the favourable opinion you do me the honour to express of me, and of the high esteem and regard with which I am, Madam, your most obedient humble servant, Hagley, Sept. 20, 1770 LYTTELTION. No. III. MADAM, I was at your door this morning, to express my concern at a letter I wrote you on the 30th of January in answer to yours, and which should have come to you by the penny post. Having miscarried, the contents of it were to tell you that I have not the least acquaintance with Mr. Foote. I cannot think of talking to him on the subject you mentioned, but take the liberty to advise you, as the best part for your service, to leave him perfectly master of your play; with this caution alone, that he shall put nothing into it which it would be unbecoming your sex to write: and to secure the performance of that necessary stipulation, let you see the alterations he proposes to make before he brings it on. I have only to add, that I am sorry for the uneasiness you have suffered by the unlucky miscarriage of my answer to your letter; that I heartily wish you success; and that I am, with the highest esteem, Madam your most obedient humble servant, Feb. 3, 1771 LYTTELTON. No. IV. * MADAM, On considering the question you do me the honour to put to me, my answer is this: If you write for fame, go on; if for money, desist, unless the Dutchess of Northumberland or Lord Chesterfield will enable you to bear the expense of continuing the paper till it becomes so well known as to support itself. This they surely could do without any inconvenience to their opulent fortunes: and this I would do, if I were in their circumstances, with great pleasure. Instead of sending you this letter, I would have waited upon you; but some indisposition confines me at home this morning; and to-morrow I am engaged to go out of town. I am, with sincere admiration of your talents and sentiments, Madam, your most obedient and humble servant, Hill-street, Jan. 13, 1771 LYTTELTON. One would like to know more about Jean Marishall, but the only information given in Sir William Musgrave's Obituary Prior to 1800 (1899), sub. Marshall, Jane is that her name appeared in A Catalogue of Five Hundred Celebrated Authors of Great Britain Now Living (1788). Recourse to that Catalogue reveals nothing new; it is merely a bibliographical notice of her two novels, her unacted comedy, and her two volumes of letters. Nothing about the periodical paper, nothing about her possible patrons. But the four letters to her are of more than ordinary interest, exhibiting and corroborating as they do the tact and courtesy of both men.</field>

"R" justified his claim by noting of the snakes in both passages that their "movements are compared to those of a ship; rolling from side to side, as sudden gusts impel it; and marking by its keel the sinuosity of its track."

      <field name="fulltext">Alexander Pope [Epitaph on Mrs. Grace Butler.] "Stript to the naked soul, escap'd from clay." (11.76). This is part of "An Account of Doctor Robert Bolton" (pp. 74-76, 162-165), a friend of Mrs. Butler and an acquaintance of Pope. Bolton wrote a "Character" of Mrs. Butler upon her death. Curiously enough, there is no index entry for either Dr. Bolton or Mrs. Butler in the index volume to the Twickenham Pope , nor is the poem mentioned in the doubtful or wrongly attributed pieces. Yet there is a footnote in the EM stating that the poem was printed in Owen Ruffhead's life of Pope, in Aaron Hill's Prompter , No. 8, "and in the works of Aaron Hill, vol. iv. p. 153 who by mistake attributes the character of Mrs. Butler to Mr. Pope" (pp. 75-76). The poem is included in William Warburton's Letters from a Late Eminent Prelate to One of his Friends [1808], p. 268, with two textual differences, both preferable to the EM text, "taste" for "task" in l. 11 and "loves" for "love" (an obvious error) in l. 14. Ruffhead's text also has "task" and "loves,' but the text in Hill's Works has "taste," surely the preferable reading, and "glooms of death" in l. 10, instead of "gloom of death" of the EM and Ruffhead. The title in Hill's Works is "A Letter from a Departed Spirit to the Author (Mr. Pope) of a Lady's Character, lately publish'd, in a Thursday's Journal," i.e. "the Grub-Street Journal of November 28, 1734" ( EM , 11.74n.).</field>

Volume 53 of the EM is for January to June, 1808; the account of Levet had appeared, anonymously, in the Gentleman's Magazine for January to June 1785. An editorial footnote in the Gentleman's states that the letter "originally appeared in the St. James's Chronicle, but with some mistakes which are here corrected; and an original letter of Dr. Johnson's is also added" (p. 101).

      <field name="fulltext">Jonathan Swift In answer (50.112) to a query by A. B. C. (49.410) about the epithets attached to the days of the week in Swift's letter to Dr. Sheridan, dated Sept. 12, 1735, J. B. offered "the following attempt," " Sunday's a Pun day ." Meaning, I apprehend, a gay day, a holiday, a felongstival. The effect of punning well applied will julongstify this explanation. Another explanation of this epithet may be, that care being thrown longside for that day, people's longspirits are afloat, and they are apt to indulge in witticilongsms or puns. For inlongstance: A company longsitting down to dine, one of them oblongserves upon a roalongst turkey— here we have Turkey in Europe . Another, upon a dilongsh of fricalongseed rabbit— Here's Rabbit in A-fricalongsee . The longson longsays to his father, "I longsaw Lady Placid at church, who inquired after the family." The father oblongserves, that he never longsaw her out of temper; "and yet," replies the longson, "when longshe longspoke to me longshe was very much ruffled ." Another longsaw Milongss Sparkle at church: "and," longsays he, "longshe looked like a fallen angel, longsor longshe was drelongslongsed in a Satanical habit ; that is, longshe wore a longsatin gown." " Monday's a Dun-day ." A dull day, when men go to work and children go to longschool. A. B. C., I prelongsume, has heard of black Monday. " Tuelongsday's a News-day ." The news of the former week began to circulate in the country about this day. " Wednelongsday's a Friends-day ." People invited a friend on Wednelongsday to a frelongsh joint, the Sunday's provilongsion having longserved Monday and Tuelongsday. " Thurlongsday's a Curs'd-day ." If this is the reading, it mulongst mean, that there were longshort commons on Thurlongsday; but if the reading were Cur's-day , that the dogs were gratified with the bones after dinner. " Friday's a Dry-day ." Every Friday in the year being, by the Rubric, appointed as a falongst, it is conlongsequently (if kept) dry of entertainment: but the epithet is longsufficiently correct, not-withlongstanding any non-conformity to the directions of the Church. " Saturday's a Latter-day ." This, as your Correlongspondent oblongserves, explains itlongself. Harold Williams, editor of Swift's correspondence, makes no attempt to explain the epithets (IV. 388-389). A. B. C. had offered some suggestions of his own, and they, too, deserve notice: " Sunday's a Pun-day ." Why a Pun-day? He could not mean the practice of punning from the pulpit longso prevalent above a century before the date of the letter to which I have alluded, becaulongse in the time of Swift it had totally longsublongsided among the Clergy of the Elongstablilongshed Church: and when I mention the names of Sherlock, Hare, Giblongson, Secker, and Rundell, it will call to your recollection tholongse of many other divines wholongse longsermons, while they reflect the highelongst honour on the age in which they were promulgated, may longserve as models for every other. Yet if he did not mean that, what did he mean? " Monday's a Dun-day ." This appellation, I prelongsume, arolongse from a culongstom longstill prevalent, of the land-lords of the poor collecting their weekly rents on Monday morning. " Tuelongsday's a News-day ." This, probably, the publication of a weekly paper on this day will explain. " Wednelongsday's a Friend's day ." This being in molongst cities one of the market-days, the Dean, it is likely, thought rendered people more liable to vilongsits from their friends, during the courlongse of it, than molongst of the others. " Thurlongsday's a Curlongsed day ." " Friday's a Dry-day ." Thelongse appellations are to me wholly inexplicable. " Saturday's the latter Day ." This longsufficiently explains itlongself. But if any of your ingenious Correlongspondents will longsolve my difficulties, and correct any milongstakes I may have made with relongspect to the other days, they will, Mr. Editor, while they elucidate one of tholongse parts of the works of the Dean that, I think, wants elucidation, at the longsame time, in all probability, longshow us, that he has not, even in his carelelongss moments, trifled without having in view longsome ulongseful, and conlongsequently moral, purpolongse. The two correspondents are in substantial agreement about Tuesday and Wednesday, but whatever their agreements or differences, theirs seems the earliest attempt to explicate Swift's lines.</field>

They range over a variety of topics, and no future account of Miss Talbot or her writings should fail to take notice of them. Years later, in April 1803, another original letter, undated and without the recipient's name, was printed in the EM (43.245), without any indication of source.

Some differences in spelling exist between the versions in the EM and the HLQ , and in one instance ( HLQ , p. 433, ll. 8-9) where the later version has "to to [sic]" the earlier has "so to," which makes acceptable sense. An editorial footnote in the EM mistakenly identifies the publisher of Hobbes's works as William Crooke, rather than Andrew Crooke, but in the next two footnotes there is matter additional to the corresponding footnotes in the HLQ .

      <field name="heading_text">Line Indentation in Stillinger's The Poems of John Keats by David H. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In The Poems of John Keats (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978), Jack Stillinger makes ten kinds of "silent" (i.e., unrecorded) emendation to his copy-texts in order to "standardize the presentational features" of his edition (p. 683). Although most of these categories of emendation indeed concern only presentation, the fourth seems more significant: "Verse paragraphs are separated by line spaces, and all except the first in a series are indented; line spaces between parts of a sonnet are ignored, and indentions in sonnets and other stanzaic forms are regularized to conventional usage" (p. 683). Implicit in this statement is the questionable assumption that line indentation is no more essential a feature of lyric-poetic texts than, for example, typographical design. I would like to suggest that this underlying assumption makes silent emendation four the source of three weaknesses in Stillinger's commanding edition. First, this policy leads the edition away from Stillinger's fundamental editorial goal, fidelity to "final authorial intentions" (which, he stresses, is manifest in the form of individual poems 1 ). Second, it disturbs the reader's aesthetic and interpretive apprehension of at least several works. And third, it distorts the literary-historical record by rendering invisible the significant variety of Keats's texts. Unable to collate Stillinger's edition with his copy-texts for all 148 poems in the corpus, I have restricted my discussion to the forty-five works from the three volumes that appeared during Keats's lifetime: Poems of 1817, Endymion (1818), and Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems (1820). 2 For all forty-five works, Stillinger uses the first edition as copy-text, arguing convincingly that Keats experienced with his publishers a "spirit of collaboration" that represented his "final intentions." 3 This paper will begin by describing all of Stillinger's silent emendations of line indentation in these works. It will conclude by more fully presenting my reservations about this aspect of editorial policy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 Stillinger silently changes indentation in sixteen poems from the three original Keats volumes. Affected are eight 1817 poems in couplets (including "I stood tip-toe" and "Sleep and Poetry"), Endymion , three 1817 sonnets ("How many bards gild the lapses of time," "O Solitude," "To Kosciusko"), and four 1820 odes ("Ode to a Nightingale," "Ode on a Grecian Urn," "To Autumn," "Ode on Melancholy"). Although the sonnets and odes are more strikingly affected by Stillinger's policy than the narrative and epistolary poems, I will present all the evidence so that readers may judge for themselves the aesthetic and interpretive implications of each emendation. To insure that all verse paragraphs begin with indentions (a goal he articulates in his apparatus, see silent emendation four, above), Stillinger emends the following 1817 poems in couplets and Endymion : "I stood tiptoe" 4 (indenting ll. 29, 35, 47, 57, 61, 107, 163, 181, 193, 205, 211), "Specimen of an Induction to a Poem" (l. 49), "Calidore" (ll. 19, 34, 38, 42, 46, 64, 73, 109, 134, 152), "Hadst thou liv'd in days of old" (l. 41), "To George Felton Matthew" (ll. 11, 31, 53, 72), "To My Brother George" (ll. 19, 53, 67), "To Charles Cowden Clarke" (l. 21), "Sleep and Poetry" (ll. 19, 41, 47, 85, 96, 122, 155, 181, 230, 270, 339, 381, 385, 389), Endymion (IV, 240 [Stillinger's IV, 238]). 1817 indents only one line in these eight poems, 248 of "Sleep and Poetry." Otherwise, verse paragraphs are not indented. The first edition of Endymion , on the other hand, makes a practice of indenting paragraphs, and the non-indention of IV, 240 is an exception. In the 1817 sonnets, Stillinger emends the sestets of three poems, apparently to match rhyming lines. (He agrees with 1817 in identing ll. 2-3, 6-7 of the octave.) To be specific, 1817 indents 10, 12, 14 of "How many bards" and "O Solitude," while Stillinger indents 10, 11, 13. As both poems have a CDDCDC rhyme scheme in the sestet, juxtaposition of Stillinger's and 1817 's versions of the sestet from "O Solitude" will visualize Stillinger's emendation of the two sonnets: But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee, 10 Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd, Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be Almost the highest bliss of human-kind, When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee. (1817) But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee, 10 Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd, Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be Almost the highest bliss of human-kind, When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee. (Stillinger) In "To Kosciusko," whose sestet employs the more classic Petrarchan rhyme of CDEDCE, 1817 indents 10, 11, 14. Stillinger, on the other hand, indents 10, 12 and double-indents 11, 14: It tells me too, that on a happy day, 10 When some good spirit walks upon the earth, Thy name with Alfred's, and the great of yore Gently commingling, gives tremendous birth To a loud hymn, that sounds far, far away To where the great God lives for evermore. (1817) It tells me too, that on a happy day, 10 When some good spirit walks upon the earth, Thy name with Alfred's and the great of yore Gently commingling, gives tremendous birth To a loud hymn, that sounds far, far away To where the great God lives for evermore. (Stillinger) As in the octave of the 1817 sonnets, Stillinger's indenting of the 1820 odes agrees with copy-text in the opening of each stanza. Like 1820 , he indents ll. 2, 4 of all stanzas, presenting these first four lines as, in Miriam Allcott's words, "one quatrain from a Shakespearian sonnet." 5 There are, however, emendations to the latter portions of several stanzas. In particular, in stanza six of "Ode to a Nightingale," 1820 indents 56, 59, double-indents 54, and indents 57 (the "short" line) by six spaces, while Stillinger indents 55, 58, and double-indents 56, 59 (also indenting 57 by six spaces): 6 Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 55 To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstacy! Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— (1820) To thy high requiem become a sod. (1820) Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 55 To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstacy! Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— To thy high requiem become a sod. (Stillinger) In his edition of "Ode on a Grecian Urn," Stillinger silently emends indentation in the final three lines of stanzas two and five. Whereas 1820 indents 19 and double-indents 20, Stillinger indents 20 and double-indents 19. And 1820 leaves 41 unindented, indenting 49 and double-indenting 50, while Stillinger leaves 49 unindented, indenting 48 and double-indenting 50: [2] Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, 20 For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! (1820) Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, 20 For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! (Stillinger) [5] Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"—that is all 50 Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. (1820) Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"—that is all 50 Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. (Stillinger) Finally, Stillinger differs from 1820 in stanza one of "To Autumn": although 1820 leaves 8 unindented and indents 9, 10, Stillinger indents 8 and leaves 9, 10 unindented. And in stanza three of "Ode on Melancholy," 1820 indents 29 and double-indents 30, whereas Stillinger indents 28, leaves 29 unindented, and double-indents 30.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 In his "Introduction," Stillinger makes a cogent case for selecting 1817 , 1818 , and 1820 as copy-text for the forty-five poems in these volumes. He argues that the first editions reflect Keats's final intentions more fully than holograph drafts or early transcripts. Adducing documentary evidence that the poet shared with his publishers a "spirit of collaboration" (see fn. 3 above), Stillinger concludes that "it would be a violation of Keats's intentions to prefer MSS to printed versions as copy-text for any of the poems in the three original volumes" (p. 13). In light of this position, Stillinger's decision silently to emend indentation in at least sixteen copy-texts is puzzling. If his edition aims to "represent, for each poem, as exactly as can be determined, the form Keats himself would have preferred above all others" (p. 1)—and if the first editions contain these "forms"—then emendation of indentation in "sonnets and other stanzaic forms" seems, in an editorial sense, self-defeating. In addition, Stillinger's silent emendation alters the reader's aesthetic and interpretive apprehension of at least several poems. The sonnets "How many bards" and "O Solitude," for example, in Stillinger's edition lose the appearance of Petrarchan, and take on that of Shakespearian sonnets. (Indenting 10-11 as well as 2-3 and 6-7 makes 9-12 resemble a third quatrain rather than part of the sestet.) And there is an interpretive as well as formalistic argument for reading these poems as Petrarchan sonnets. 7 But even if this were not so, Stillinger's editing would still have altered the subtle interplay of syntax, rhyme, and stanzaic form that contributes to poetic meaning. Finally, this aspect of Stillinger's landmark edition is ahistorical. 8 Precisely because Keats wrote at a time of great stanzaic experimentation, his textual inconsistencies are an important part of the literary-historical record. The editorial impulse to regularize seems, in relation to his texts, anachronistic: clearly remote from his distinctly irregular age. An implicit explanation of Stillinger's policy of silently emending indentation may be found in his apparatus: by classing indentation with such features of the text as "typographical peculiarities of titles" and the use of dots rather than asterisks to separate stanzas (p. 683), he invites his reader to conclude that indentation has only presentational significance. But one need not be a hard-line formalist to find this faulty reasoning and poor literary theory. Surely, as critics like Wellek and Warren have pointed out, 9 patterns of line indentation affect poetic meaning, and not only in the cases of shaped or concrete poetry. It therefore seems incumbent upon editors of scholarly texts to retain copy-text indentation unless there is a compelling, historical reason to alter it. Indeed, copy-text indentation merits the respect due a significant manifestation of authorial intention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "The texts are edited according to the ideal of 'final authorial intentions'; that is, they are supposed to represent for each poem, as exactly as can be determined, the form that Keats himself would have sanctioned and preferred over all others" (p. 1). 2 I have repeatedly collated Stillinger's edition with numerous copies of each original volume, including the following: two copies of 1817 in the J. Pierpont Morgan Library, three in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library, and one in the Columbia University Library; three copies of 1818 in the Berg Collection and one in the Houghton Library at Harvard University; four copies of 1820 in the Berg Collection, one in the Morgan Library, and one in the Columbia University Library. 3 Pp. 12-13. Stillinger borrows the phrase, "spirit of collaboration," from G. Thomas Tanselle's "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," SB , 29 (1976), 167-211 (reprinted in Tanselle, Selected Studies in Bibliograph [Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1979], pp. 309-353). In this article, which importantly influences Stillinger's editorial policy, Tanselle argues that "it is possible for someone other than the 'author' to make alterations which are identical with the intention of the 'author,' when the relationship partakes of the spirit of collaboration" (p. 191). 4 Throughout I use Stillinger's, rather than first edition, titles for individual poems. 5 Allott, in her generally well-received edition of Keats ( The Poems of John Keats [1970]), describes the "regular ten-line stanza [of the odes], consisting of one quatrain from a Shakespearian sonnet followed by the sestet of a Petrarchan sonnet . . ." (p. 523). 6 The five copies of 1820 I collated all agree on the indentation of stanza six. However, a 1922 "reprint" of the volume (London: Humphrey Milford) agrees with Stillinger. I cannot account for this discrepancy and under the circumstances feel compelled to prefer primary to secondary evidence. 7 In both works there is (as one expects in a Petrarchan sonnet) a clear interpretive as well as formal division between the octave and the sestet, with the final six lines modifying the point made in the first eight. Specifically, the octave of "How many bards" describes the "pleasing" intrusion of "throngs" of previous bards on the poet's mind when he "sit[s] down to rhyme." The sestet, a single sentence beginning with the comparative conjunction "so," likens the "chime" of these poets to "the unnumber'd sounds that evening stores," thus strengthening the sense that the "bards" are welcome to "intrude" on the poet. Similarly, the sestet of "O Solitude" (also a new sentence beginning with a conjunction) modifies the desideratum of the octave—solitary communion with nature—by preferring to it natural communion with a "kindred spirit." The Petrarchan pattern of line indentation in these poems highlights the crucial interpretive break between ll. 9 and 10, encouraging the reader to perceive ll. 9-14 as a sestet. 8 The argument for historicism in scholarly editing is succinctly made by Tanselle in "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Problems of Editing" ( SB , 34 [1981], 23-65): "The most basic distinction is between editions in which the aim is historical—the reproduction of a particular text from the past or the reconstruction of what the author intended—and those in which the editor's own personal preferences determine the alterations to be made in copy-text. Scholarly editions conform to the first approach . . ." (p. 60). 9 See René Wellek and Austin Warren, "The Mode of Existence of a Literary Work of Art," in Theory of Literature (1942; rpt. New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1956): "the role of print in poetry is by no means confined to . . . rare extravaganzas; the line-ends of verses, the grouping into stanzas, the paragraphs of prose passages . . . and many similar devices must be considered integral factors of literary works of art" (p. 144).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">An Unknown Gissing Story from the Chicago Daily News by Robert L. Selig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recently discovered an unknown Gissing story in the Chicago Daily News of 1877, a story dating from his year of American exile. The search for Gissing's youthful lost fiction has lasted now some two-thirds of a century. His best-known novel, New Grub Street (1891), provided the earliest clue: the minor character Whelpdale, a resilient London hack, tells of first getting published during an ill-considered trip to America's Middle West. With almost no money remaining in his pockets, he wrote a short story and had it accepted by Chicago's largest newspaper. "For some months," Whelpdale adds, "I supported myself in Chicago, writing for that same paper, and for others." 1 In 1912 a thinly disguised Gissing biography by his friend Morley Roberts, The Private Life of Henry Maitland , asserted that Whelpdale's transatlantic adventures came from Gissing's own life—specifically from his year in the United States after his college thefts for his prostitute love, his expulsion from Owens, and his imprisonment in Manchester. Roberts challenged American scholars to look for Gissing's fiction in the Chicago Tribune , that city's largest newspaper in the late 1870s. Shortly after the First World War, a group of researchers including George Everett Hastings, Vincent Starrett, Thomas Ollive Mabbott, and Christopher Hagerup found eight Gissing stories in the Tribune just as Roberts had foretold: three signed "G. R. G." and five without signature. The publication dates ranged from March 10 to July 29, 1877. Both manner and theme identified even the unsigned pieces as Gissing's. Next, Whelpdale's last words caught the eyes of the researchers—"for that same paper, and for others"—and they shifted their investigation to the rest of Chicago's press. Sure enough, they found three more stories in Chicago dailies other than the Tribune —all unsigned but clearly by Gissing. The publication of these extended from April 28 to June 2, 1877. 2 In the late 1920s and the early 1930s, three further stories cropped up from Gissing's American stay: "An English Coast-Picture" in Appletons' Journal (New York) (July 1877); "The Artist's Child" in the Alliance (Chicago) (30 June 1877), an obscure religious paper; and "A Terrible Mistake" in the National Weekly (Chicago) (5 May 1877), an even more obscure and ephemeral publication. All three of these pieces appeared under the pseudonym "G. R. Gresham"—the name of a villainous character in Workers in the Dawn (1880), Gissing's first novel. Then, after a lapse of almost fifty years, Pierre Coustillas and I found two more Gissing stories in Chicago's Alliance : "A Mother's Hope" (12 May 1877) and "A Test of Honor" (2 June 1877). Like the previously uncovered story in the Alliance and also like those in Appletons' and in the National Weekly , these two newest finds bore the pen name "G. R. Gresham." 3 My latest discovery of an unknown Gissing story comes from a paper ignored till now in the search for Gissing's fiction—the Chicago Daily News . I found my clue in Professor Mabbott's description of where he and others had looked: the Tribune , the Journal , the Post , the Times , the Inter-Ocean , but, curiously enough, not the News —Chicago's largest evening paper in 1877. 4 When I read through the News of Gissing's American year, I found an unsigned story that I thought undoubtedly his—"Too Wretched to Live" (24 April 1877, p. 2). The gloomy theme and the journeyman prose have the unmistakable ring of Gissing's early work. And in the News of May 18, 1877, I found an important piece of corroborating evidence: "The Warder's Daughter"—a virtually unchanged version of Gissing's "The Warden's Daughter," which had first appeared in Chicago's Journal of April 28, 1877, and was identified as his by both Starrett and Mabbott. Struggling to earn his keep from one week to the next, Gissing apparently gained a second payment for a story already published by a rival Chicago daily. The News piece remains essentially the same as that appearing in the Journal . The few alterations in scattered words and in a single phrase could easily have occurred during simple recopying. For many years later, Gissing retained the habit of submitting his work in longhand. Obviously, he could not have sent the News the clipped-out published version, for that would have exposed it as an already-used story. He could have recopied either the Journal 's printed version or his own hand-written draft. One other possibility remains: simultaneous submissions of slightly different manuscripts, followed first by publication in the Journal and then by Gissing's failure to withdraw his story from that paper's local rival. In any case, the title change from the Americanized "Warden" to the British form "Warder" argues against a mere case of literary piracy by the News 's American staff—a piracy without the awareness of the young man from England. Most importantly, the appearance in the News of this known Gissing piece establishes that the editors had a taste for his fiction—circumstantial evidence that tends to support his authorship, as well, of "Too Wretched to Live." The publication date of "Too Wretched to Live"—April 24, 1877—falls well within the period of Gissing's other known stories from Chicago: March 10 to July 29, 1877. More specifically, Mabbott and Starrett established that Gissing's fiction had appeared in dailies other than the Tribune from April 28th through June 2nd. Indeed, "Too Wretched to Live" came out in the News four days before his first other extant non-Tribune story—"The Warden's Daughter" (the Journal , 28 April 1877). In view of the News 's prominence and its extensive use of fiction, Gissing's turning to that paper soon after the Tribune seems just what one would expect from a struggling young writer in Chicago of the late 1870s. "Too Wretched to Live" contains marks of Gissing's handiwork at least as compelling as the external evidence. Consider, for example, the jilted Lilian Frasier's suicide by drowning. In Gissing's early fiction and even in works from the '90s, the plot device of drowning recurs like an obsession. In his very first story, "The Sins of the Fathers" (1877), the heroine commits both suicide and murder by drowning herself and her former fiancé. The heroine in "Brownie" (1877) avenges the murder of her poor drowned sister by driving the villain into drowning himself too. Watery suicide also turns up in the novelette All for Love (written 1880; pub. 1970) and in two short stories from about this same period: "The Last Half Crown" (written 1879-1880; pub. 1970) and "Cain and Abel" (written 1880; pub. 1970). Accidental drowning occurs in "The Quarry on the Heath" (written 1881; pub. 1970) and, most memorably, in a piece from Gissing's maturity—"The Day of Silence" (1893). In this late working-class story, the death of father and son during a pleasure trip on the Thames evokes an almost tragic intensity. Death by water also appears in Gissing's full-length novels. In Workers in the Dawn (1880), the hero chooses its most spectacular form: he throws himself into Niagara Falls. In Denzil Quarrier (1892) suicide by drowning ends the life of sensitive Lilian, who has the same first name as the "crushed and broken lily" in "Too Wretched to Live." Even The Odd Women (1893), one of the novelist's best known works, contains two random drownings: the first by a boating accident and the second by suicide in a mental ward's bathtub. Given this frequent pattern in much of Gissing's fiction, one can recognize the drowning in "Too Wretched to Live" as an identifying sign—a virtual Gissing watermark. The broad narrative subject of "Too Wretched to Live"—the hero's abandonment of one woman for another—also serves to mark the story as Gissing's. He uses this theme in his early, middle, and even late fiction. At times he provides mitigating details to help excuse man's fickleness, but at others he presents the most extreme cases: males who engage themselves to an alternative woman while still engaged to a first. His earliest story, "The Sins of the Fathers" (10 March 1877), has the hero discard his old love for a new one, but with many extenuating circumstances. A variant of this theme appears in Workers in the Dawn (1880), when the hero tries to abandon his false love for his true one but is blocked by the inconvenience of having unwisely bound himself as husband of the rival female. Interestingly enough, the protagonist in Workers has the same first name, Arthur, as the inconstant young man in "Too Wretched to Live." A rather sympathetic treatment of the fast sexual shuffle occurs in both The Unclassed (1884) and in A Life's Morning (1888). By the time of New Grub Street (1891), however, Gissing depicts male fickleness with rueful comedy and by Our Friend the Charlatan (1901) with broadly satiric ridicule. In embryonic form, then, "Too Wretched to Live" contains a persistent and basic Gissing theme: off with the old love and on with the new. With its stiff formal prose interspersed with attempted lyricism, the style of "Too Wretched to Live" provides a further mark of the youthful Gissing's authorship. Like many others of his early short stories, this one sets the scene with a flowery description of landscape, sky, and sun: "The sun was just setting as he turned the corner of the house and both sea and sky were bathed in a crimson splendor. . . ." This purple patch bears a strong resemblance to an opening passage from "A Mother's Hope": ". . . The long track of sunlight, which gleamed from the horizon to the limits of the wet sands, kept ever spreading as the sun rose higher, . . . till the whole sea and shore exulted in the splendors of the new day." 5 Similar effusions about splendid suns or overarching skies open other stories from the writer's early period: "An English Coast-Picture," "A Test of Honor," "The Death-Clock," and "R. I. P"—all from 1877. But as his art matured, Gissing outgrew this neoromantic habit of beginning his short stories with lyrical weather reports. Another of Gissing's stylistic quirks—the pedantic term imported from Latin or Greek—appears near the climax of "Too Wretched to Live": "As he glanced at the handwriting, a woman's delicate chirography. . . ." From the Greek root kheirographon , that bookish final word intrudes upon a scene of supposedly high emotion. The former classics student from Owens College, Manchester, never lost his taste for ink-horn phrases. To the end of his writing career, he retained a preference for erudite words over plain ones—for visage or physiognomy over simply face . Even in Born in Exile (1892), one of his finest novels, we find a broad sprinkling of learned expressions: "susurration," "sequaciousness," "intenerates." 6 Thus the fancy word chirography in the Daily News story provides further evidence of George Gissing's authorship. From a biographical viewpoint, "Too Wretched to Live" has a special connection with "The Sins of the Fathers," Gissing's first story. Both pieces construct troubled fantasies out of his guilty feelings at having left Nell Harrison on the other side of the ocean—his prostitute love for whom he had besmirched himself back at Owens College. In Gissing's later life, his romantic guilt undid him: he returned to Nell after one year abroad and eventually married this unreformed and alcoholic streetwalker. They lived together unhappily, though not quite ever after, for they separated at last in 1883. In "The Sins of the Fathers," Nell Harrison's fictional counterpart walks the streets of an English city very like Manchester. Though the hero saves her from becoming a prostitute, his father falsely tells him that she has suddenly died, and the hero marries instead a pretty American schoolgirl. At the end the Nell-like figure becomes an avenging "Medusa"—a word used to describe her in the very first paragraph. In effect, the protagonist has much justification for feeling relieved when he thinks her dead—good riddance of a wild female. Yet in "Too Wretched to Live," the egoistic hero has no excuse at all but snobbery. He abandons a sweet and respectable young farm girl for a fashionable beauty who sings drawing-room opera—a beauty whose last name even suggests nobility: Earle . Then he discovers, too late, that he really preferred his dead former love to her more elegant rival. In a final touch of Gissing lugubriousness, the protagonist marries the rival woman anyway but lives unhappily ever after. The contrast between the "Medusa" avenger in Gissing's first story and the tender-hearted suicide in the newly discovered piece illustrates a weakness running through his early work. The youthful writer tended to depict all women as one of two extremes: idealized angel or deplorable man-trap. His early novels usually contain both a female saint and a slut: seraphic Helen Norman versus drunken Carrie Mitchell ( Workers in the Dawn —1880), good-hearted Ida Starr versus hateful Harriet Smales ( The Unclassed —1884), sweet Jane Snowden versus murderous Clem Peckover ( The Nether World —1889). Not until Gissing could achieve such complex female characters as Cecily Doran in The Emancipated (1890) or Marian Yule and Amy Reardon in New Grub Street (1891) would he attain full development in his fictional art. "Too Wretched to Live" records a faltering early step on his way to becoming one of late-Victorian fiction's most skillful portrayers of women. The complete text of the story follows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TOO WRETCHED TO LIVE "I think that will do; I have broken it to her as gently as I could," soliloquized Arthur Melville, as he sealed and directed a letter, which, to judge from the appearance of the table where he had been writing, upon which were scattered several sheets of letter paper partly written upon, had been a difficult one to compose. Then, turning to the mantel-piece, he carelessly lighted a cigar, and strolled out upon the beach. The sun was just setting as he turned the corner of the house and both sea and sky were bathed in a crimson splendor; but the beauty of the sunset seemed lost upon the young man to-night, for his brow was clouded, and he appeared lost in a deep and paintful [sic] reverie. Just then the sound of a woman's voice, singing some snatch from a favorite opera, fell upon his ear, and seemed to instantly banish all but joyous thoughts from his mind. "She told me to come to her room at 8, and it is now only half-past 6," he remarked, glancing at his handsome gold repeater. "I shall have time to walk up to the cove and back before then. My beautiful, peerless Jessie! And she has at last consented to marry me. I can scarcely realize my good fortune yet. How different she is from Lilian Frazier [sic—elsewhere spelled as Frasier ]! And yet I thought I loved Lily last summer well enough to ask her to be my wife; but after I met Jessie Earle my love for Lilian all died out. I wonder if Lily will feel badly when she receives my letter telling her how my feelings have changed toward her, and asking her to release me from my engagement? Poor little girl! But then she will soon get over it, doubtless, and probably marry some young farmer. I don't believe she ever loved me very much—she was such a quiet little thing." And then he began comparing her with Jessie, and by the time he returned home had made up his mind that it was all for the best—his meeting beautiful Jessie Earle and forsaking poor Lilian. Arthur Melville was the son of a wealthy and aristocratic family, and the summer before, while out fishing, he had lodged for six weeks at Linden Farm, with the Frasiers. Here his fancy had been captivated by the beauty and grace of Lilian, the old people's grandchild, and when he left he was engaged to her. Entering the house—for the Melvilles were spending the summer there—Arthur proceeded at once to the Earles' room, and in the presence of Jessie soon forgot the letter that was destined to prove so fatal to the happiness of a loving young girl's heart. "Grandpa!" "Well, darling, what is it?" The speakers were an old man and a fair young girl, over whose head scarce eighteen summers had rolled. They were standing at the gate of a pretty farmhouse, half hidden in the vines which clambered over it, and the old man was just preparing to get into the carriage which stood waiting for him, when he was interrupted by his granddaughter. Looking down, he saw a sweet, pleading face upturned to his; the roses had forsaken her cheeks lately, and, oh, such a sad, wistful look had crept into the sunny blue eyes that it made his heart ache to look at her. "What is it, pet?" he repeated. "Don't forget to call at the postoffice, grandfather; there must be a letter today," she answered. "You have felt so every day, Lily, and yet it is six weeks since you have heard a word from that rascally lover of yours. It's my opinion he's a deceitful villain. I never did like the looks of him much, and now for him to treat you this way! O, if I only had him here—that's all!" shaking his whip at some imaginary person. "O, do not speak so! He never, never would be false to me—his little Lily, grandpa! No, he is ill, or something has happened to prevent his writing. But I would stake my life on Arthur's truth!" she said, throwing back her head while a red flush mantled each cheek at her grandfather's words. "Well, maybe so, Lily dear, maybe so," and whipping up his horses he started towards the place. All day long Lily flitted about the house, every now and then running to the window to see if she could catch a glimpse of the returning carriage, even when she could not expect them for hours. At last the long day drew to a close, and just as the sun was setting she saw them coming. With the speed of a fawn she flew down the path to the gate, and stood there breathless awaiting his arrival. Yes, he held something white in his hand, and held it up for her to see it; then it must be a letter from Arthur, for no one else wrote to her. "Give it to me—quick, grandpa!" she exclaimed. "It is for me, isn't it?" "Yes, it's for you, at last." With a cry of joy she took it, and hugged it close to her bosom. Then, darting away, she ran until she came to the orchard, and at last, sinking down under the apple-tree where Arthur had asked her to be his bride, she took the long-looked-for letter and kissed the writing and the seal; then carefully opening it, she read the following: "Friend Lily: My long silence, I feel, demands an explanation, and so I will give it to you in this short letter. In alluding to your little flirtation of last summer, which we were foolish enough to end by an engagement, I should like to say a few words. I hope the matter was not more serious to you than it was to me, and so I desire that you will release me from my promise to you, Lily; it was only a passing fancy. Since meeting beautiful Jessie Earle, I know what real love is. I do not think that your feeling for me will be more enduring than mine for you has been. Doubtless ere this you have outlived it, for I remember you were always rather shy and cool in your expressions of affection toward me. Hoping that we shall always be friends, I am yours, truly, "Arthur H. Melville." The young girl read this cruel letter through, and then she turned, and, burying her face in the long grass, burst into a storm of passionate, tearless sobs, which shook her slender form as the fierce winds bend some tender flower. She lay there until at last the pale moon rose slowly, slowly over the tree tops, and then her grandfather, who, alarmed at her long absence, had come to seek her, found he[r] lying cold and still, with the letter on the ground by her side. Tender arms raised her, and bore her away to the farm-house. Here, for weeks, she was confined to her room, and when at last she left it, she looked like a crushed and broken lily, so white and delicate and fragile was she. From the hour of her receiving Arthur's letter, his name never passed her lips. * * * The sun was shining bright and beautiful. A lovely morning, indeed," thought Jessie Earle as she drew back the curtain of her luxurious room. "It is an old saying, 'Blest is the bride that the sun shines on.' I ought to be blest, for there is plenty of sunshine on my wedding day." Arthur Melville sat toying with his cup of chocolate on the same summer morning, the day on which he was to wed Jessie Earle, when the footman entered and handed him a letter. As he glanced at the handwriting, a woman's delicate chirography, he started back as if he had seen an apparition. At last, regaining his composure, he tore it open and read as follows: "Arthur:—Ere you receive this letter, the heart which loved you and trusted you so fully will be at rest, and you will be free to wed the beautiful girl who has won your heart away from me. So you thought I did not love you! Well, perhaps not, Arthur Melville: but I cared for you so much that your smile made all the sunlight of the world for me. Your voice was sweeter than the sweetest music to my ears. I loved you so beneath the shy exterior which hid the depth of my devotion that I cannot live in the black darkness which has fallen upon my life with the withdrawal of your love. I should have answered your letter ere this, but I have been very, very ill ever since I received it. I do not think I am entirely well yet, for my poor little head burns and throbs so all the time. Last night, when they were all asleep, I rose very softly, and went down into the orchard; the moon was shining. O, so soft and clear! just as it did that night when you told me that you loved me. I went and stood under the same tree, and then I walked over to the little lake by the north woods; it is all covered with the lilies now, just as it was the day when we went rowing there, and you gathered so many for your Lily, you said. The lilies kept whispering to me me [sic] last night to come there and find rest; but I had to write to you first, and you must tell grandfather and grandmother where I've gone. O, the water is so blue and soft! I must go now while the moon shines so brightly. So good-by, Arthur: don't forget me; think, sometimes, of poor little Lily, sleeping underneath the calm, still waters." With a deep groan Arthur Melville sank back in his chair, and just then the door was suddenly opened, and the form of old Mr. Frasier entered. "Have you seen anything of my grand-daughter, Arthur Melville?" he exclaimed. "Three days ago she suddenly disappeared; we have searched everywhere, but can find no clue to her whereabouts. She sent a letter to the post, by the boy, directed to you, on the same evening in which she disappeared. I found out about it yesterday, and so I took the next train and came here. Lily has not been in her right mind for two or three weeks; she was so gentle and quiet, but O! I have had such a dreadful fear. That letter is in her writing!" and before Arthur could interfere he had snatched it from the table and read the fatal missive. When he had finished it, he sprang to his feet, and pointing his finger at Arthur, cried: "Arthur Melville, the law may never brand you as such, but I declare you as a murderer, just as much as though you had plunged a knife into my darling's heart. Oh, accursed was the day in which you came to Linden Farm, with your false words, to break the heart of the sweetest maiden that ever lived! Dead— drowned—my little Lily! May your life be as wretched as you have made mine! May ——" "Hush! your curses cannot make me more wretched than I am," exclaimed Arthur, springing to his feet. "I feel the brand of Cain upon my heart! I loved your granddaughter—I know it now! I was fas[c]inated by another, but my heart was Lily's all the time, I know it when, alas, it is too late." Arthur Melville married Jessie Earle, but from the hour in which he received Lillian [sic] Frasier's letter, he never knew real happiness.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"Native to New England": Thoreau, "Herald of Freedom," and A Week by Linck C. Johnson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thoreau's admiration for Nathaniel Rogers, editor of Herald of Freedom , an anti-slavery newspaper published in Concord, New Hampshire, has been fully documented. 1 But some confusion still exists about the text of Thoreau's "Herald of Freedom," a review of the newspaper that first appeared in the Dial in April 1844. A truncated version later appeared in the posthumous A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform Papers in 1866. In a recent edition of Reform Papers , Wendell Glick pointed out some apparent inconsistencies in the 1866 printing. He therefore adopted the Dial version as copy-text of "Herald of Freedom," adding the text of two leaves Thoreau drafted sometime after Rogers' death in 1846. But these and other surviving manuscripts in the Houghton Library indicate that Thoreau in 1847 revised "Herald of Freedom" for A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers . Before the publication of A Week in 1849, however, Thoreau omitted the revised version of "Herald of Freedom," which apparently consisted of the truncated text printed in A Yankee in Canada plus at least the two leaves of new material printed in Reform Papers . A study of the original review and his later revisions thus clears up a number of questions about the various texts of "Herald of Freedom"; it also offers new insights into Thoreau's attitude toward Rogers and other reformers, and his conception of A Week . In his review in the Dial , Thoreau stressed the connection between Rogers and New England. Remarking that Rogers had once been a lawyer in Plymouth, New Hampshire, "still further up the Merrimack," he began "Herald of Freedom" by praising Rogers' editorials, "flowing like his own mountain-torrents . . . and always spiced with the essence of the fir and the Norway pine." 2 Although Thoreau humorously noted that "there is rather too much slope to his channel" and appealed for "more pause and deliberation," he commended the health and vigor of Rogers' "yankee style" ( D , 509). Thoreau, already planning a book about the boating and walking tour he and his brother made into New Hampshire in 1839, obviously savored Rogers' loving references to the people and places of New England. 3 In a series of extracts from Herald of Freedom , for example, he included Rogers' call to the people of New England to an anti-slavery convention in Boston, and Rogers' similar summons to a convention in New Hampshire, which read in part: "From where the sun sets behind Kearsarge, even to where he rises gloriously over Moses Norris's own town of Pittsfield ; and from Amoskeag to Ragged Mountains, —Coos—Upper Coos, home of the everlasting hills, send out your bold advocates of human rights,—wherever they lay, scattered by lonely lake, or Indian stream, or 'Grant,' or 'Location,'—from the trout-haunted brooks of the Amoriscoggin, and where the adventurous streamlet takes up its mountain march for the Saint Lawrence. "Scattered and insulated men, wherever the light of philanthropy and liberty has beamed in upon your solitary spirits, come down to us like your streams and clouds;—and our own Grafton, all about among your dear hills, and your mountain-flanked valleys—whether you home along the swift Ammonoosuck, the cold Pemigewassett, or the ox-bowed Connecticut." ( D , 510) His selection of this incantatory catalogue of towns, mountains, and rivers revealed Thoreau's own keen interest in the topography of New Hampshire, which was to play such a crucial role in A Week ; it also illuminated his distinction between Rogers and other reformers. Retaining a foothold in his native soil, Rogers "looks out from a serener natural life into the turbid arena of politics," Thoreau remarked ( D , 508). In contrast to most reformers, whose obsession with disease and evil repelled Thoreau, Rogers fights slavery "with what cheer may be" ( D , 508-509). Rogers' perspective also enabled him to speak in the voice of common humanity. Early in the review Thoreau remarked that no other paper "keeps pace so well with one forward wave of the restless public thought and sentiment of New England" ( D , 508), and, following the extracts from Herald of Freedom , he described these "timely, pure, and unpremeditated expressions of a public sentiment" as "the most generous gifts a man can make" ( D , 512). Calling for a collection of Rogers' writings, Thoreau concluded: "Long may we hear the voice of this Herald" ( D , 512). The voice of this Herald was not, however, destined to be heard for very long. Rogers retained control of the newspaper long enough to reprint Thoreau's review and to acknowledge receipt of Emerson's First of August Address on emancipation in the West Indies, which Thoreau sent to him. But by the end of 1844 Stephen S. Foster, with the support of William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and others of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society, had wrested control of Herald of Freedom from Rogers, who had begun "to agitate for the dissolution of all anti-slavery societies, charging them with infringing upon the individual prerogatives of their members." 4 In March 1845, Rogers established a rival Herald of Freedom , prefixed by the article The , but failing health forced him to relinquish the editorship in the summer of 1846. He died on October 23, 1846. Probably because he was determined to remain aloof from the controversy among the abolitionists, and because he was increasingly preoccupied with other matters, Thoreau did not comment on the conclusion of Rogers' career. Although he sent a tribute to Wendell Phillips to the Liberator in March 1845, shortly before Rogers established The Herald of Freedom , the letter was probably not intended as a gesture of support to the Garrisonians. In fact, Thoreau probably agreed with Emerson, who felt that Rogers was right, "without or against any or all statements." 5 But as he prepared to move to Walden Pond, Thoreau apparently decided to devote himself to literary rather than to political matters. Thus, at the time of Rogers' death in the fall of 1846, Thoreau was busy writing an extended Journal account of his recent trip to Maine, gathering material for Walden , and drafting A Week . Thoreau's interest in Rogers was rekindled by the publication of a collection of Rogers' newspaper writings in June 1847. 6 Thoreau, who had called for such a collection in "Herald of Freedom," apparently borrowed the volume from Emerson shortly after its publication. The editor obviously shared Thoreau's enthusiasm for Rogers' descriptive powers, for the collection contained a good deal of travel writing, including an account of a trip through the White Mountains, reprinted as "Anti-Slavery Jaunt to the Mountains" from Herald of Freedom for September 10-October 8, 1841. Thoreau probably read this section with particular interest, since he described a similar jaunt at about the same time of year in "Thursday" in A Week , which he had recently begun to circulate to publishers. As he read other selections, Thoreau was probably also struck by the congruity between his own political positions and Rogers' comments on the military, moral versus political action, and the individual's relationship to church and state. In fact, Thoreau would soon discuss all of these issues in a lecture on "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in Relation to Government," delivered early in 1848. Whether or not it inspired his lecture, the collection of Rogers' writings prompted Thoreau to revise "Herald of Freedom" for A Week , which failed to attract a publisher in 1847. On a surviving leaf of notes, most of them truncated quotations with page references to the collection, Thoreau jotted, "It was here that the Herald of Freedom was printed at the time our voyage was made." 7 This "voyage" was obviously the brothers' trip on the Concord and Merrimack, for, following a description of their arrival in Concord, New Hampshire, at the end of four surviving manuscript leaves from "Thursday," Thoreau concluded: "It was here that the Herald of Freedom was published at this time. We had". 8 The second sentence breaks off at that point, so it was probably followed in the manuscript of A Week by a revised and compressed version of the original Dial article, later used as copy for "Herald of Freedom" in A Yankee in Canada , plus some leaves of additional material Thoreau drafted in 1847 from his notes on the collection of Rogers' newspaper writings. Although the revised Dial text has not survived, a comparison of the first sentence of "Herald of Freedom" in the Dial and in A Yankee in Canada suggests that the revised text served as copy for the 1866 printing: Dial We have occasionally, for several years, met with a number of this spirited journal, edited, as abolitionists need not be informed, by Nathaniel P. Rogers, once a counsellor at law in Plymouth, still further up the Merrimack, but now, in his riper years, come down the hills thus far, to be the Herald of Freedom to those parts. ( D , 507) A Yankee in Canada We had occasionally, for several years, met with a number of this spirited journal, edited, as abolitionists need not to be informed, by Nathaniel P. Rogers, once a counsellor at law in Plymouth, still farther up the Merrimac, but now, in his riper years, come down the hills thus far, to be the Herald of Freedom to these parts. 9 The revisions in the opening sentence reveal an effort to place "Herald of Freedom" in the context of A Week . As in the surviving manuscript from "Thursday," the version in A Yankee in Canada begins "We had" rather than "We have," the first of numerous alterations in verb-tense in the 1866 printing. Wendell Glick has objected that if Thoreau revised "have" to "had" in consideration of Rogers' death in 1846, he surely would not have allowed "now, in his riper years" to stand. 10 But in the context of A Week , "had" would have referred to the time before the voyage, while "now" would have referred to the time of the voyage in 1839, when Rogers was still alive. It is, of course, also possible that the editors of A Yankee in Canada did not scrupulously follow copy, since, as Glick has pointed out, changes like "Merrimack" to "Merrimac" indicate unauthorized editorial meddling ( RP , 293). But editorial meddling hardly explains the alteration of "those parts" to "these parts," which was clearly designed to fit "Herald of Freedom" into A Week . In the Dial , Thoreau was praising a writer in another town, so he referred to Concord, New Hampshire as "those parts"; in "Thursday," he was describing a visit to that town, so he referred to it as "these parts." Other substantive variants in the 1866 printing suggest that the editors of A Yankee in Canada had access to the text of "Herald of Freedom" Thoreau had revised for A Week . The second paragraph of the Dial version began: "We have neither room, nor inclination, to criticise this paper, or its cause, at length, but would speak of it in the free and uncalculating spirit of its author. Mr. Rogers seems to us to occupy an honorable and manly position in these days, and in this country . . ." ( D , 508). The first sentence was omitted in the 1866 printing, in which the paragraph began, "Mr. Rogers seems to us to have occupied an honorable and manly position in these days, and in this country . . ." ( YC , 207). The omission of the first sentence is even more significant than the shift in verb-tense. Like the title of the article, also omitted in A Week , the sentence called attention to the newspaper and its cause. Its omission shifts our attention from the antislavery newspaper Herald of Freedom to the qualities of its editor, Nathaniel Rogers. Thoreau in the Dial stressed the poetry of Rogers' "yankee style," an aspect of his work that received even greater emphasis in the 1866 printing. For example, in his introduction to the extracts from Herald of Freedom , Thoreau noted in the Dial : "We cannot do better than enrich our pages with a few extracts from such articles as we have at hand" ( D , 509). In the 1866 printing, the extracts were introduced with the comment: "Some extracts will show in what sense he was a poet as well as a reformer" ( YC , 208). Moreover, that increasing emphasis on Rogers' literary abilities governed the selection of extracts, for, of the seven extracts included in the Dial , only Rogers' two descriptive summonses to the people of New England were retained in the 1866 printing. By omitting the other extracts, which were purely political, Thoreau apparently sought to shift even more attention from Rogers the reformer to Rogers the writer. The omissions also made room for at least two leaves of additional material Thoreau attached to the revised text of "Herald of Freedom" in the manuscript of A Week . 11 From his notes on the collection of Rogers' writings, Thoreau drafted a new conclusion to "Herald of Freedom." In addition to the comment, "It was here that the Herald of Freedom was printed at the time our voyage was made," which served to introduce the revised version in "Thursday," in the notes he remarked, "But since our voyage he has died and now there is no one in New England to express adequately the contempt and indignation at any cant and inhumanity—which may still be felt" (MH, 11). Whereas in the Dial he had concluded with a call for a collection of Rogers' writings and the comment, "Long may we hear the voice of this Herald," Thoreau thus began the new conclusion: Such timely, pure, and unpremeditated expressions of a public sentiment, such publicity of genuine indignation and humanity, as abound everywhere in this journal, are the most generous gifts which a man can make. But since our voyage Rogers has died, and now there is no one in New England to express the indignation or contempt which may still be felt at any cant or inhumanity. (RP, 56) The contrast between the first paragraph, carried over from the Dial , and the second paragraph, which forms a transition to the additional material drafted in 1847, reveals a marked shift in tone. In 1844, Thoreau praised Rogers' expressions of "indignation and humanity"; in 1847, he mourned that there was no one left to express "indignation or contempt." In the intervening years, Thoreau's own contempt for cant and inhumanity had grown apace, fueled by his arrest in 1846, the Mexican War, and by the failure of the political and religious establishment in New England to oppose slavery. A good deal of his contempt found an outlet in A Week , in which he attacks the Church in "Sunday," and the State in "Monday." In the new conclusion to "Herald of Freedom" drafted for "Thursday," he thus approvingly quoted Rogers' stern rebuttal to one who argued that Christ never preached abolition. In short, Rogers denied the premise, but asserted that, if true, it simply demonstrated that Christ "' did'nt do his duty '" ( RP , 56). Although he applauded Rogers for rejecting any external authority if it conflicted with the demands of conscience, Thoreau in both his notes and in the conclusion drafted from them praised Rogers' poetry at the expense of his politics. As noted above, Thoreau apparently omitted Rogers' political statements when he revised the Dial text for A Week . Similarly, with the exception of the reference to Christ, all of the extracts alluded to in the notes or quoted in the new conclusion illustrated Rogers' feeling for New England rather than his political views. Indeed, Thoreau clearly sought to distinguish between Rogers' political writings, which revealed all of his limitations, and Rogers' descriptive writings, which revealed his enduring love of nature: "His was not the wisdom of the head, but of the heart. If perhaps he had all the faults, he had more than the usual virtues of the radical. He loved his native soil, her hills and streams, like Burns or Scott. As he rode to an antislavery convention, he viewed the country with a poet's eye, and some of his letters written back to his editorial substitute contain as true and pleasing pictures of New England life and scenery as are anywhere to be found" ( RP , 57-58). Thoreau's comment helps explain his decision to revise "Herald of Freedom" for A Week . The tribute to Rogers was clearly not intended as a pat on the back to abolitionists or other reformers, nor even as an assertion of Thoreau's own political views. Instead, Rogers served as a paradigm of a man whose commitment to a transient cause did not blind him to the permanent verities of nature and human life. In his "true and pleasing pictures of New England life and scenery," Rogers had captured something Thoreau sought to capture in A Week . Following a long extract from Rogers' celebration of Swamscot, Massachusetts, a fishing village whose bold and adventurous inhabitants demonstrated the rugged independence of the New England character, Thoreau continued: "He was born and bred far up this stream, under the shadow of the higher hills" ( RP , 298 n.). Like his initial reference to "these parts," Thoreau's reference to "this stream" places the revised version of "Herald of Freedom" in the context of A Week . Indeed, by quoting Rogers' descriptions of Plymouth, his native town on the upper reaches of the Merrimack, Thoreau subtly shifted attention back to the narrative in A Week . On the leaf of notes, Thoreau had jotted: "His memory continually reverts to this scenery of his boyhood—even the minuter features of the landscape. We feel inclined to make a pilgrimage if only to see that graceful elm &amp; that clump of pines which he describes so lovingly" (MH, 11). In the context of A Week , that "we" referred to Henry and John Thoreau, bound from Concord to Plymouth. Thoreau revised the passage to read, "To this scenery his memory continually reverted," an introduction to the final extract from the Herald of Freedom , Rogers' description of a magnificent elm in his native town of Plymouth ( RP , 298 n.). Thus, as the brothers' arrival in Concord, New Hampshire occasioned the tribute to Rogers, the revised version of "Herald of Freedom" concluded with a glimpse of Plymouth, the brothers' next stop on their journey to the White Mountains. Thoreau probably omitted the revised version of "Herald of Freedom" from A Week for a variety of reasons. Before he omitted the tribute from the manuscript, Thoreau apparently first deleted Rogers' descriptions of Plymouth, interlining the comment: "His style and vein though often exaggerated and affected were more native to New England than those of any of her sons, and unfinished as his pieces were, yet their literary merit has been overlooked" ( RP , 57). As that somewhat lame and grudging conclusion suggests, Thoreau may have lowered his estimate of Rogers' writings. His decision to omit the tribute to the abolitionist was also in keeping with others of his revisions of A Week during 1848, when Thoreau omitted a good deal of material concerning contemporary social issues and added a substantial amount of material on literature and colonial history. 12 For example, he evidently added another Dial essay, "Aulus Persius Flaccus," to "Thursday" in 1848, so he possibly decided that the chapter could not accommodate both the Roman satirist and the abolitionist-editor from New England. In place of the revised version of "Herald of Freedom" in "Thursday," Thoreau consequently added a passage on the early settlement of Concord from Benjamin L. Mirick's History of Haverhill, Massachusetts and the marvelous meditation on a true frontier life ( W , 303-304). Thoreau's primary reason for omitting the tribute to Rogers from "Thursday" is perhaps suggested by the only quotation from Rogers' writings in A Week . Without identifying Rogers by name, Thoreau in a description of the Merrimack in "Sunday" quotes "one who was born on its head water," who wrote: "'Down out at its mouth, the dark inky main blending with the blue above. Plum Island, its sandy ridges scalloping along the horizon like the sea serpent, and the distant outline broken by many a tall ship, leaning, still , against the sky'" ( W , 85). In contrast to "Herald of Freedom," a reminder of New England's failure to live up to its own ideals by opposing slavery and the Mexican War, the quotation in "Sunday" serves a radically different function. Indeed, by echoing Samuel Sewell's The New Heaven and the New Earth , Rogers in the brief extract in "Sunday" had affirmed the promise of life in New England, a promise Thoreau reaffirmed in A Week . Thoreau's decision to omit the article from A Week resulted in a good deal of confusion about the text of "Herald of Freedom." The editors of A Yankee in Canada apparently discovered the revised pages from the Dial among Thoreau's papers and, not realizing that he had revised it for A Week , used them as copy for "Herald of Freedom." They apparently also had access to the leaves Thoreau had added in 1847, but, with the exception of the revised form of the final paragraph of the Dial version, the editors omitted the additional material. Noting this and other inconsistencies in the version printed in A Yankee in Canada , Wendell Glick rightly decided to adopt the Dial version as copy-text for "Herald of Freedom." But to the Dial version Glick added the text of the two leaves Thoreau drafted in 1847 as part of his revision of "Herald of Freedom" for A Week . Glick argued that, if Thoreau had reissued the review, "he would have incorporated" the additional material ( RP , 295). That is possibly true, but Thoreau probably also would have incorporated many of his revisions of the Dial version of "Herald of Freedom." Thus both the revisions incorporated in A Yankee in Canada and the additional material included in Reform Papers are misleading, for, when he made these revisions and drafted the additional material, Thoreau was incorporating "Herald of Freedom" into the manuscript of A Week , where, for a short time at least, Nathaniel Rogers served as a paradigm of a man whose life and writings were rooted in his native soil of New England.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Stephen Crane's Manuscript of "This Majestic Lie" by Paul Sorrentino</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Stephen Crane's "This Majestic Lie" was prepared for volume 6 of the Virginia edition of Crane's works in 1970, no manuscript of the story was known. As a result, the story's publication in Wounds in the Rain (Stokes, 1900) served as copy-text. The manuscript, however, is now in the Castle collection at the Bryn Mawr College Library. If only because Crane holographs are scarce, its discovery is important; but the manuscript also allows us to emend the text in the Virginia edition and to learn more about Crane's method of revision. 1 Ethelinda Schaefer Castle, an alumna of the class of 1908, presented the manuscript as a gift to the library in 1971. Written in purple ink, it consists of eleven leaves that measure 33.3 mm. x 20.6 mm. The paper is medium-weight, smooth-textured, and cream-colored. On leaves 1 and 7-10, the watermark is "Economic | HM&amp;S"; on leaves 2-6 and 11, the watermark is the Britannia design. Leaves 1-4 and 7-11 have a tear sign along the left edge; leaves 5-6, along the right. The tear suggests that the leaves came from a sheet 33.3 mm. x 41.2 mm., with a watermark on one side and a countermark on the other. The versos of all the leaves have word counts and cumulative totals in purple ink, blue ink, pencil, and green crayon. The verso of leaf 6 includes the following list: I Pictures of War Red Badge of Courage The Little Regiment Three Miraculous Soldiers A Mystery of Heroism An Indiana Campaign A Grey Sleeve Story-Youth's Companion Vol. II Maggie George's Mother Minor Conflicts Vol. III The Monster Whilomville Stories Vol. IV Active Service Vol. V. A Man and Some Others The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky The Wise Men The Five White Mice One Dash Horses The Blue Hotel Twelve O'Clock Vol. VI The Open Boat Flanagan Vol. VII The Price of the Harness "God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen" The Clan of No-Name The Lone Charge of William B. Perkins The Charge of the Adolphus Several notes of explanation about the list are necessary. "Story—Youth's Companion" probably refers to "An Episode of War," which Crane sold to Youth's Companion in 1896. The corresponding editor of the magazine had written Crane expressing an interest in publishing his stories; however, only "An Episode of War" appeared there. 2 "Minor Conflicts" refers not to a particular story but to a heading in the table of contents of the English edition of The Open Boat (1898). Under the heading are "The Open Boat," "A Man and Some Others," "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky," "The Wise Men," "The Five White Mice," "Flanagan and His Short Filibustering Adventure," "Horses," and "Death and the Child." Curiously, Crane listed all but the last story in volumes 5 and 6, thus raising the question as to what he meant to include under "Minor Conflicts" in volume 2. Perhaps they were to be Bowery tales to supplement Maggie and George's Mother . Finally, "The Charge of the Adolphus" is most likely an early title (or else a contaminated reading from the preceding entry) for "The Revenge of the Adolphus ," which he revised after showing it to Commander J. C. Colwell, the U. S. Naval Attaché to the American Embassy in London. The list shows that Crane envisioned the works printed as a seven-volume set perhaps by William Heinemann, who published the English edition of The Open Boat and Pictures of War (1898), Crane's "Volume 1." The list also helps date the composition of "This Majestic Lie." Although R. W. Stallman concluded that Crane wrote the story in Havana in October, 1898, four items on the list suggest otherwise. 3 Crane's first mention of "God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen" is in a letter dated 1 February 1899 to James B. Pinker, his literary agent in London: "You will be glad to know that I am now writing a story with which you can have good game: 'God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen.'" 4 "The Revenge of the Adolphus " was written between March—early May, 1899 (VI, pp. cxxxi). Although Crane began thinking about Active Service in October, 1897, he did not finish it till mid-May, 1899 (III, pp. li-liii). And "Twelve O'Clock" was apparently finished around August, 1899 (V, pp. cxix-cxx). The dating of the four stories gives more evidence to Fredson Bowers' conclusion that Crane finished the "Lie" in September, 1899 (VI, pp. lxxxix-xc). To simplify collation of the manuscript with the text of "This Majestic Lie," the table of "Substantive and Accidental Variants" uses the same format as other tables of variants in the Virginia edition. Each entry begins with a page-line reference. The first reading is from volume six in the edition; following the bracket is the reading in the manuscript. A wavy dash (˜) signifies repetition of the same word in the edition; a subscript caret (&amp;c.rat;) signifies lack of punctuation. A dagger (τ) points the reader forward to "Alterations in the Manuscript," where the record for the entry is completed. And an asterisk (*) means that the reader should consult the textual note for the entry in the Virginia edition. Accidentals occurring repeatedly are recorded the first time only with et seq. For example, the notation "202.25 et seq. Café] Cafe" means that beginning with page 202, line 25, every time "Cafe" appears in the manuscript it lacks an acute accent. Not recorded are minutiae invariably used by Crane that a typist or compositor would have automatically corrected: uncrossed "t's," "it's" for "its," and contractions with no apostrophe like "wont," "dont," and "cant." Crane's inconsistent positioning of punctuation marks is also not recorded. Most of the variants are accidentals and show especially Crane's penchant for hyphens. Some variants result from carelessness and would have eventually been corrected. A few, though, answer questions raised by the textual notes in the Virginia edition, while others change the meaning of the text. In the note to "204.14 rang," for example, Bowers concluded that "Despite the general authority of A1 [ Wounds in the Rain , the copy-text], its reading 'sang' for N [ New York Herald , the text collated against A1] 'rang' seems affected more by an assumed need for conformity with 'sang' also in 204.14 than with the sense" (VI, p. 330). However, in the manuscript Crane wrote "sang," not "rang." In another passage, Crane describes Johnnie's attitude after being blackmailed in an attempt to buy eggs, bread, and coffee: "Johnnie's subsequent activity in Havana could truthfully be related in part to a certain temporary price of eggs. It is interesting to note how close that famous event got to his eye so that, according to the law of perspective, it was as big as the Capitol at Washington, where centres the spirit of his nation. Around him he felt a similar and ferocious expression of life which informed him too plainly that if he was caught he was doomed" (216.25-31). Crane did not write "similar and ferocious," as in the printed authorities, but rather "sinister and ferocious." The word similar is confusing because Johnnie's life has not been compared with any other "expression of life." Sinister makes more sense in the context of the passage as well as with the next two sentences: "Neither the garrison nor the citizens of Havana would tolerate any nonsense in regard to him if he was caught. He would have the steel screw against his neck in short order." Crane's own changes, as listed in "Alterations in the Manuscript," reveal his correcting mistakes (though not all), clarifying images by choosing more precise words, and altering the tone. At one point, for example, Martha says to Johnnie, "I'm old enough to be your mother or, maybe, your grand-father . . ." (215.16-17), but Crane changed "father," an obvious mistake, to "mother." Other alterations—e.g., "blue and white pyjama uniforms" for "blue and white" (202.26-27), "stammered" for "gasped" (212.10), "surveyed" for "looked" (213.32), and "gazed" for "looked" (215.30)—more appropriately fit the context. Deletions also affect the tone of important passages. Early in the story Crane describes the hostility of Cubans, who, believing that the Americans have lost in the Philippines, lament "How unfortunate it is that we still have to buy meat in Havana when so much [Yankee] pork is floating in Manila Bay." Crane reflected on his description, the bracketed section being part of what he originally wrote: "This will be thought to be embittered writing. Very well; the writer admits its untruthfulness in one particular. It is untruthful in that it fails to reproduce one-hundredth part of the grossness and indecency of popular expression in Havana up to the time when the people knew they were beaten [and in defence of this statement the writer will eagerly [accept] meet the contentions of any man who will first prove that he has enough information and intelligence from which to make an argument.]" (202.8-14). Crane first deleted "accept" for "meet," then canceled the second half of the last sentence. Apparently he had originally intended to keep the sentence intact, for on the verso of leaf 1 are two word counts, the first one taken before the passage was deleted; the second, after. He must have eventually felt that the original version was too arrogant and defensive. Crane altered another passage dealing with the nature of reporting. Throughout Wounds in the Rain (as well as other works such as Active Service ) he railed against the yellow journalism of Joseph Pulitzer's World and William Randolph Hearst's Journal , whose editors expected a reporter "to bawl into their ears a whirlwind tale of heroism, blood, death, victory or defeat—at any rate, a tragedy" (204.21-23). Stories were misrepresented. If a news story "arrived at Key West as a mouse, it was often enough cabled north as an elephant" (204.16-18). If reporters objected to sensationalistic reporting, "managing editors fought us tooth and nail and we were all sent boxes of medals inscribed: 'Incompetency.' . . . we were urged by our managing-editors to remember that the American people were a collection of super-nervous idiots who would immediately have [bloody] convulsions if we did not throw them some [carrion of false] news—any news" (205.4-6, 12-16). Again, Crane deleted the bracketed words. Though small, the deletions soften the abusive tone and, perhaps more importantly, lessen a comparison between the enemy's cannibalistic clamoring for corpses of Yankee pigs and Americans' "bloody convulsions" if they are not fed "some carrion of false news." One other alteration concerns a date in the text. Crane originally wrote "I met Johnnie in Havana in November, 1898" (220.8), but then changed November to October. Because Crane was careless in dating his own letters, sometimes listing the wrong day or year, it is curious he should be concerned with accuracy here. It suggests a difference in concern with detail between fiction and real life. The discovery of the manuscript for "This Majestic Lie" thus allows us to examine the holograph for variants and to observe Crane's mind at work as he alters the text. Scholars can now see what Crane wrote and learn more about his writing practices.

A collation of this text with that in the Virginia edition reveals about 100 substantive and accidental variants.

      <field name="heading_text">Three Separate Leaves from Robert Frost's Derry Years: A Note and Transcriptions by Roger D. Sell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stored together with Robert Frost's Derry notebook 1 are three separate leaves of white wove paper, written in his handwriting of the same period. His handwriting of a much later date (1951) also appears on two of them, in notes confirming the Derry provenance. Since they are now badly frayed and soiled, they have been Mylar-encapsulated by library staff. Two of them, blue-ruled and measuring 165 x 218 mm. and 173 x 212 mm., are essentially independent of the notebook. The third, however, probably belonged to it at one stage. Its unruled paper seems to be the same, and at 140 x 215 mm. it is not significantly larger than the notebook's leaves (129-134 x 202-213 mm.). On one of its short edges we can assume there were originally two holes (one now torn away completely), corresponding to those with which the other leaves were threaded into the notebook cover. The leaf can be fitted into the sequence of leaves as the very last leaf. (Anywhere else, it would upset both the flow of contents and the correspondences—stains, and indentations from heavy writing—deriving from physical contact between adjacent leaves.) And in this position it would of course be a natural candidate both for detachment, for contents of a different kind, and for more wear and tear. One of the blue-ruled leaves contains a version of the poem about a blue-bird which was revised for publication in Collected Poems 1930. 2 The catalogue of the Barrett Frost collection notes variants. 3 Two other manuscript versions of the poem, apparently an earlier and a later, exist in other libraries. 4 Both the other leaves contain prose jottings. Lawrance Thompson suggests that the one probably taken from the notebook was used by Frost for memoranda in his efforts to inspire his students at Pinkerton Academy to a more original style of composition. 5 I should myself suggest that the jottings on the other leaf represent some interesting essay topics. And I have already pointed out all these cryptic notes, on both leaves, should be read as shorthand for thoughts on politics, aesthetics and versification, on the value of science, learning and virtue, such as were to recur throughout Frost's life; and that four points in particular anticipate later statements even in verbal detail, revealing what were to become some of his most fruitful poetic beliefs. 6 The Derry period was crucially formative for him, and these two leaves offer a fascinating insight into the way his mind was working at that time. Both Thompson and I myself have quoted and paraphrased from them, but only very incompletely. Frost scholars now need a full transcription such as is offered below. As nearly as possible, the transcriptions preserve the relative positions of the words on the page. Italic type represents writing in ink; the rest is in pencil.

      <field name="heading_text">The Construction of Hart Crane's Last Poem, "The Broken Tower" by Joan St. C. Crane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most reliable external evidence of a date when Hart Crane first conceived the structure of his last major work, "The Broken Tower," comes from a much-quoted statement made in September 1932, a few months after Crane's death, by Lesley Byrd Simpson. 1 According to Simpson, who knew Crane while both were in Mexico on Guggenheim Fellowships, inspiration for the poem's dominant symbols occurred on 27 January 1932 in Taxco. This contemporary account describes Crane's chance meeting before day-break with the Indian bell-ringer from the Church of Santa Prisca in Taxco. He accompanied the old man to the church tower and helped him ring the bells as dawn broke over the mountains. Simpson saw Crane later in the morning of the 27th (a Wednesday) and witnessed his intense response to the experience: ". . . he seized my arm and bore me off to the plaza, where we sat in the shadow of the church, Hart the while pouring out a magnificent cascade of words." Less credible is Peggy Baird Cowley Conklin's version, 2 which conflicts with Simpson's in that she places herself at the center of Crane's inspiration and sets the time of the poem's conception a month earlier at Christmas 1931 when her liaison with Crane began. Written thirty years after the episode and exhibiting, as it does, a highly subjective and selective hindsight, Peggy Cowley's recollection is questionable in accuracy. Although it is perfectly plausible that Crane may have begun to attempt by poetic means an interpretation of his affair with Peggy Cowley before the bell-tower incident and it is true that "The Broken Tower" owes existence largely to their erotic relationship (some lines composed earlier may have been incorporated into the poem), the dawn bell-ringing experience has been verified by a postcard of the Santa Prisca bell tower sent by Crane to Ethel Clark, an employee of the family candy store and restaurant in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, on 27 January 1932. Crane's message on the verso: "Have just been up, at dawn, and rung the bells,—or helped to—in the towers of this old church here. And set off rockets, too. Love, Harold". 3 The progression of work on the poem indicates that Crane found here the emblem needed to move "The Broken Tower" towards expression. After several false starts and lengthy revision, the poem was completed on 25 March and Crane immediately sent a copy to Morton Dauwen Zabel, an editor at Poetry magazine. He re-typed the poem and sent fair copies with personal notes appended to each to Samuel Loveman, an old Cleveland friend, and Malcolm Cowley (the estranged husband of Peggy Baird Cowley) on Easter Sunday, 27 March. He had sent early drafts of work in progress to Peggy Cowley and another friend, Solomon Grunberg, during February. Hart Crane's death by drowning off the passenger ship, Orizaba , bound from Vera Cruz to New York, occurred on 27 April 1932. This neat coincidence of dates is the only tidy aspect attending the conception, creation, and completion of "The Broken Tower" against a chaotic background of Crane's last three months of life. Seven typescript drafts, worksheets and fair copies (ribbon and carbon) of the poem are known to exist, although there were (and, possibly, still are) others extant. Six of these are listed as C43-48 in Kenneth Lohf's The Literary Manuscripts of Hart Crane (1967). 4 The seventh—either Crane's own ribbon fair copy or the copy sent to Poetry magazine 5 —came to light in a Swann Galleries, Inc., auction sale (Cat. 1055, item 71; 10 March 1977) in a consignment from the books and papers of Samuel Loveman. The date, "March 25th. 1932", of this typescript is superscribed with Crane's holograph signature. Typed at left is: "Hart Crane, / 15 Micheocan, / Mixoac, / Mexico D.F." This is the penultimate manuscript version of the text on which Crane made several holograph corrections that were incorporated two days later in the fair copy (with carbon) he typed for Loveman and Malcolm Cowley. This copy, which later passed into the hands of Loveman, is now in the private collection of Maurice F. Neville, Santa Barbara, California. It is chronologically the fifth in the sequence of known variant texts. The earliest typed worksheet, undated, consisting of trial versions of stanzas 1-3 and 5, is in the Butler Library of Columbia University (Lohf C43). It has a typed note at the foot: "(More to follow—this is the new be-/beginning) / [holograph:] Hart". This typescript was sent to Solomon Grunberg with a letter of 8 February in which Crane says, ". . . I've got to work on the first impressive poem I've started on in the last two years. I feel the old confidence again; and you may know what that means to one of my stripe!" (Weber 387). Text: The bell cord that gathers God at Dawn Dispatches me — as though I fell down the knell Of the new day. . . I could wander the cathedral lawn Clear to the crucifix, and back again from hell. Haven't you seen — or ever heard those stark Black shadows in the tower, that drive The clarion turn of God? —to fall and then embark On echoes of an ancient, universal hive? The bells, I say, the bells have broken their tower! And sing, I know not where. . . Their tongues engrave My terror mid the unharnessed skies they shower; I am their scattered — and their sexton slave. And so it was, I entered the broken world — To hold the visionary company of love, its voice And instant in a hurricane (I know not whither hurled) But never —no, to make a final choice!. . . . A second version of these four stanzas, slightly revised, was sent to Peggy Cowley, dated 9 February 1932, with the note beneath: "— To be continued, by / your [holograph:] Hart". This ribbon typescript is in the University of Virginia collection (Lohf C44). Text: The bell cord that gathers God at dawn Dispatches me, as though I dropt down the knell Of the new day. . . I wander the cathedral lawn Straight to the crucifix — right to and fro from hell. Have you not seen, nor ever heard those stark Black shadows in the tower, that whirl The clarion turn of God? Falling, didst never remark How echoes, like banners, spread as they unfurl? The bells, I say,—the bells have broken their tower! They beat, I know not where. Their tongues engrave My terror mid the unharnessed skies they shower; I am their scattered and their sexton slave. And so it was I entered the broken world — To hold the visionary company of love, its voice An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled) But never —no, to ['make' del. ] know a final choice! In a letter to Peggy Cowley dated 10 February 1932, Crane writes, "The version of the beginning of 'The Broken Tower' that I sent you early this morning is probably to be changed a good deal yet" (Weber 388). Later in February, to Peggy Cowley: "I worked late on my poem last night despite all the disturbance. . . . I hope to send you more of the poem in a few days" (Weber 392). To his stepmother, Bessie M. Crane, he wrote on 8 March, "Yes, Bess, I'm really getting to work on one of the strongest pieces of poetry I've ever written." 6 On 20 March, Crane wrote again to Grunberg: "The poem ('Broken Tower') has undergone considerable change and extension since the version I sent you. I'm so glad that you liked it. I'm not sending any more of it to you, however, until it's quite finished" (Weber 395). The third variant typescript text in the chronology (2 pp., ribbon, University of Virginia [Lohf C45]) is the most complex of the extant working drafts. It contains all ten stanzas, but is heavily revised with Crane's holograph corrections and emendations and his name signed twice in the left margin of the first page. Additional versions of stanzas 8 and 9 are typed on p. 2 and a holograph draft of stanza 10 with extensive re-working. On the verso of p. 1 is typed: "15 Michoacan, / Mixcoac, D F / Mexico / March 14th, 1932" (this date does not have a demonstrable relationship to the working text of the recto, but was probably within a few days of the worksheet and can stand as an approximate indicator of the date on which Crane drafted this version). Beneath, in Crane's hand, is the line: "That rings the ['answer' del. ] sweet-decorum that the flesh evokes". On the verso of p. 2 are lines in Crane's hand [at top]: " Virginia / from 'The Bridge' / O rain at seven, / Paycheck at eleven— / Keep smiling the boss away, / Mary (what are ['you' word smudged ] going to do?)"]. Beneath are two experimental lines for stanza 4 of "The Broken Tower": "Oval encyclicals in chorus leaping / The canyons high wide ['voices' del. ] arteried". At the foot, two experimental lines for stanza 9: "----but drop a stone / Into a pool - and hear the silence ['widen' del. ] / In rings of emerald, azure, widen til they [ illegible word : ring(?)]". The fourth typescript variant text (3 pp., ribbon, University of Virginia [Lohf C46]) is a later working draft based on variant three. It contains eight stanzas on p. 1, stanzas 9 and 10 on p. 2 with a second version of stanza 10 typed beneath, and two more versions of 9 and 10 on p. 3. Each page has corrections in Crane's hand. The ribbon typescript sent to Poetry magazine (or retained by Crane), described above, is the fifth variant, dated 25 March 1932. The fair copies (ribbon and carbon; both with one ink correction by Crane in line 23) sent by Crane to Malcolm Cowley (2 pp., carbon, Yale University [Lohf C47]) and Samuel Loveman (2 pp., ribbon, Columbia University [Lohf C48]) comprise the completed text as it was first printed in The New Republic 71, 914 (8 June 1932). 7 With Cowley's copy, he wrote: "I'm wondering whether or not you'll like the above poem—about the 1st I've written in two years. . . . I implore your honest appraisal of this verse, prose or nonsense—whatever it may seem. Please let me know." 8 Appended to Loveman's copy is a note which reads in part: ". . . here's a poem—about the first in 2 years—tell me if you like it or not. . . ." 9 Both copies have "Easter '32" typed in the body of the letter text, although the envelope of the Loveman copy (also at Columbia University) is postmarked 29 March 1932. This fair copy was apparently typed by Crane on 27 March, but could not have been mailed on Easter Sunday; hence, the discrepancies in the dating of this typescript. Since the texts of both are identical, they are here designated together as the sixth variant typescript text before publication. "The Broken Tower" is a 40-line poem in ten 4-line stanzas, first published posthumously in The New Republic on 8 June 1932, five weeks after Crane's death. It was first collected in The Collected Poems of Hart Crane (New York: Liveright, Inc., 1933) 10 and has been reprinted in most collections of Crane's poetry published since. The collation of manuscript and printed texts below includes: 1 C43 (NNC) 2 C44 (ViU) 3 C45 (ViU): 3a 1st versions of stanzas 8 and 9 (9 includes first two lines only and is the author's holograph) 3b 2nd version of stanza 9 3c 2nd version of stanza 8 and 3rd of 9 3d 1st version of stanza 10 (all holograph) 4 C46 (ViU): 4a 1st versions of stanzas 9 and 10 4b 2nd versions of stanzas 9 and 10 4c 3rd version of stanza 10 5 Maurice F. Neville coll. 6 C47 (CtY); C48 (NNC) 7 The New Republic 71, 914 (8 June 1932) 8 The Collected Poems of HC (NY 1933) For convenience, certain shorthand symbols familiar in textual notation are employed in this collation. A wavy dash (˜) represents the same word that appears before the bracket and is used exclusively in recording punctuation or other accidental variants. An inferior caret (&amp;c.rat;) indicates the absence of a punctuation mark when a difference in the punctuation constitutes the variant being recorded, or is a part of the variant. A vertical stroke (|) represents a line ending. The collation includes Crane's revisions in his typescripts. In order to ease the difficulty of reading quoted revised material of some length and complexity, the following convention is adopted. The quoted text will ordinarily be the final version in the typescripts, whereas the processes of revision are described within square brackets. To specify what words in the text are being affected by the description within square brackets, an asterisk is placed before the first word to which the description in brackets applies; thus it is to be taken that all following words before the square brackets are a part of the described material. In formulaic transcriptions double asterisks can also be used to set off subsidiary alterations occurring between the single asterisk and the bracketed description that applies to this single asterisk. Inferior brackets clarify subsidiary bracketed descriptions within or before the main bracketed entry with or without the use of asterisks according to circumstances. 11 All ellipsis periods are the compiler's except for those that clearly correspond to ellipses that appear in a poetic line. Line references are to the 1933 text numbered 8. Unless otherwise indicated, all alterations in the typescript are in the author's hand. 12 1 bell-rope] ˜&amp;c.rat; cord 1,2 2 me&amp;c.rat; . . . dropped] me—as though I fell 1; me,—as though I dropt 2 3 Of a spent day—] Of the new day . . . 1,2; *an ['old' del. ] passed [ insrtd. for del.

Peggy Cowley's "The Last Days of Hart Crane," first published in Venture 4, 1 (1961), is reprinted here on pp. 147-173. 3 In the private collection of Vivian H. Pemberton, associate editor of the Hart Crane Newsletter . The text was first published in HCN 2, 2 (Spring 1979) in Pemberton's article, "The Composition of 'The Broken Tower,'" pp. 6-10. 4 Kenneth Lohf's entry C49 is not included here. This typescript (and carbon) was made by Samuel Loveman in 1932 from the version sent to him by Crane on 27 March 1932 (C48). 5 Brom Weber, ed. The Letters of Hart Crane, 1916-1932 . (1965). Weber 402 is Crane's letter to Morton Zabel of 20 April 1932: "About a month ago I sent you a poem, for possible use in Poetry , but have not as yet heard from you about it. The letter may have gone astray for all I know. . . ." Zabel's reply on 24 April 1932 is quoted in John Unterecker's Voyager: A Life of Hart Crane (1969), 759: "I am alarmed to hear that you sent a poem to the Poetry office, for none has reached me. . . . I hope to hear from you directly abt the poem. . . . Diligent search has failed to discover [it] at the office." 6 Thomas S. W. Lewis, ed. Letters of Hart Crane and His Family . (1974), p. 651. Letter to Bessie M. Crane. 7 The first printing of "The Broken Tower" in The New Republic contains a typographical error in line 6: "town" for "tower". Two minor changes from the final manuscript occur in the removal of commas after 'hope' (l. 24) and 'pebbles' (1. 35). 8 Malcolm Cowley quoted this note (appended to his copy of "The Broken Tower") in a letter to the editor of The New English Weekly 1 (14 July 1932) challenging a statement made in Gorham Munson's article, "A Poet's Suicide and Some Reflections," in NEW 1 (23 June 1932) that Crane had submitted "The Broken Tower" to various editors five years before, thereby casting doubt on the date of composition and its chronological place as Crane's last poem. Cowley's letter: "'The Broken Tower' was written this spring, in Mexico, over a period of a month, during which many people saw unfinished versions of it. In letters from Mixcoac, where Hart was living, I had accounts of its progress. Finally on Easter Day, he sent me the completed poem. . . ." 9 Crane says "a" poem rather than "the" poem, indicating that he had not sent working drafts to Loveman as he had to Grunberg and Peggy Cowley. Crane's note continues: "Happiness continues, with also all the gay incidentals of a Mexican Easter — exploding Judases, rockets, flowers, pappas (excuse me, that's the spelling for Mexican potatoes!) mammas, delicious and infinitesimal children wearing masks and firemen's helmets, flowers galore and a sky that carries you ever upward! . . . ." 10 Joseph Schwartz and Robert C. Schweik, Hart Crane: A Descriptive Bibliography (University of Pittsburgh Press [1972]), A4.1 (Presentation copies, pp. 33-34). Of the first edition, first impression, 50 copies were supplied with a limitation notice on p. ii (blank in the regular trade issue): "FIFTY COPIES OF THIS WORK / HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE / FOR PRESENTATION ONLY TO THE / FRIENDS OF HART CRANE / This copy is number / [4 horizontal lines over which the number was machine-stamped in blue ink]". The title-page states that the book was edited with an introduction by Waldo Frank; however, a copy of the trade issue, sold at the Swann Galleries sale of 10 March 1977 (cat. 1055, item 74), has laid in an undated note by Samuel Loveman: "I was actually the editor of the Collected Edition. Most of the posthumous poems were in such fragmentary or inchoate state, that I had to piece or cement them together. Waldo Frank was chosen by Mrs. Crane [Grace Hart Crane, the poet's mother] as impresario, because of his name value." This statement is at partial variance with Loveman's recollection in Hart Crane: A Conversation with Samuel Loveman , edited by Jay Socin and Kirby Congdon (1964) in which he mentions the choice of Frank over himself because of Frank's greater literary prominence, but makes no claim to acting in an editorial capacity on the book. 11 For complete explication of the style employed, see Fredson Bowers' "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants," Studies in Bibliography 29 (1976), 212-264. 12 The stylistic arrangement for this collation was provided by Anne McCoy and Betty Berkeley, editorial coordinators for the William James textual project, University of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Autograph Manuscripts of Fsulkner's "The Lilacs" by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To date very little is actually known about the composition of one of William Faulkner's most ambitious poems, "The Lilacs," even though all the known extant experimental manuscript versions contained in the Faulkner Collections at the University of Virginia and in the William Faulkner Collection of Louis Daniel Brodsky have been listed and in a few cases even published or reproduced photographically. 1 The reason for this lack of information has to do in part with the unintegrated nature of the documents. 2 When all the manuscripts are reassembled and transcribed, they reveal a compositional sequence complete with the exception of most of stanza three and all of stanza four of the first published version of "The Lilacs." 3 Transcribed below are the seven experimental versions from both repositories ordered in their apparent sequence, followed by a complete printing of the 3-page pencil draft of "The Lilacs." This copy will be collated against the 3-page fair ink copy titled "The Lilacs" that appears on its rectos to suggest its intermediary position between the experimental pencil drafts and the fair ink copy. Finally, the hand-lettered text from the burned booklet titled "The Lilacs" 4 will be printed to show its relative importance in advancing, if not superseding the fair ink copy, toward a more fully realized approximation of the poem which would finally appear in print in the Double Dealer in June, 1925.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky 13a Recto This and the six successive pages of drafts were all written in pencil. It seems plausible that having finished all his experimental versions, Faulkner went back over and selected from each those lines which he then incorporated into the apparently first "complete" pencil draft of the poem. Note that this page contains with two omissions (the word 'real' in line five from the top and the comma following 'rooks' in the fifth line from the bottom) and two minor inclusions (dashes after 'Cigarettes? No?' and 'Last spring') all the lines Faulkner recorded in his 3-page pencil draft ( Man Collecting , p. 20) which comprise stanzas 1 and 2. Also significant is the way Faulkner managed to obscure certain details. Though at this stage he retains reference to 'Blighty' (England) he does dispense with the names and occupations of two of the three personae. This, as well as later decisions to eliminate specific details, helps create a sense of the universal.

      <field name="fulltext">Virginia ("single torn leaf") Recto This entry in Man Collecting , p. 23, unfortunately suffers from two mistakes. The first, a typographical error, has confused it with the entry above it, a 5-page carbon typescript of "The Lilacs" dated 1925. In fact, this "single torn leaf," though its size is uncertain due to an uneven rip across its full width (it could be either 11 x 8½ inches or 14 x 8½ inches, both of which would be consistent with other drafts in the series), contains pencil versions on both sides. The second mistake is one of attribution of the material. The editors state that the sheet contains "experimental versions of the third, seventh and last stanzas." Actually, the recto consists of versions of the third, fifth, and sixth stanzas; the verso contains an unchanged version of the seventh stanza. The complete poem has nine stanzas. Thus, the entry should read: "'The Lilacs.' Autograph manuscript, 2 pages (on recto and verso of a single torn leaf) in pencil. Experimental versions of the third, fifth, sixth and seventh stanzas." The first unfinished stanza on this page actually contains the first four lines of stanza 3 of the first "complete" pencil draft. The second stanza on this sheet, with two major deletions ('said James' in the first line and 'at night' in the third), one minor alteration ('nor' for 'or' in line four) and two additions in transposing this to the first "complete" pencil draft ('far thin sky to stalk' in the ninth line and the addition of one completely new antepenultimate line) becomes the fifth stanza of the poem. Note again how Faulkner has opted to delete reference to his personae by name; in this case, James, the motor salesman. The third stanza on this page represents the first of at least four separate attempts to finalize what became stanza 6 of the poem. The first five lines of this version are carried over intact, except for punctuation changes in the second line, into the first "complete" pencil draft. It was a morning in late May Like a white woman A white wanton at the edge of a brake A rising whiteness mirrored in a lake Yes—said James—you are right One should not die like this At night And for no cause or reason in the world Tis right enough for you to talk ['Of sweeping the sky to find ['the kiss gentle kiss' del. ] Deaths kiss' del. ] ['Of Death' del. ] ['Of sweeping the sky to stalk' del. ] Of going into the sky to stalk The kiss of Death, you did not know the bliss Of home and children and the serene Of living, and the work and joy that was our heritage. . . . ['Still, we would not have' del. ] Still, it could not be otherwise We had been Raiding over Mannheim, you've seen The place? Then you know How one hangs just beneath the stars, and seems To see the incandescent entrails of the Hun And you doubtless know The searchlight gleams that cross and recross like sounds [ ] racket of engines and the coughing unfolding of Arches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky 13c Verso This version of stanza 6, possibly the next in the sequence of tentative completions, begins by reiterating in its first thirteen lines what Virginia's "single torn leaf" recto develops. It concludes with the formative image of 'fireflies', which will remain in the final draft, surfacing before it breaks off. The narrative detail is very prominent in this draft. We had been Raiding over Mannheim. Youve seen The place? Then you know How one hangs just beneath the stars, and seems To see the incandescent entrails of the Hun, And you doubtless know Those strong sharp searchlight gleams That cross and recross like sounds ['And [ illeg. ]' del. ] ['To the chap who is impaled on two of them' del. ] ['For the bloody Hun, when all is said and done' del. ] And the racket of engines and the slow Coughing unfolding of Archie shell. ['Well' del. ] ['They boxed us in the whirl' del. ] We had released our bombs and started home There were Huns everywhere by now Like wasps around a bat ['Crosses, crosses, crosses' del. ] ['Then the first tracers' del. ] And tracer bullets like fireflies in dew laden thickets They boxed us in the whirl And did us in</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky 13b Verso This version of stanza 6, like its two precursors, retains the first five lines which will appear intact in the first "complete" pencil draft. However, Faulkner abandons the images of searchlights, engine racket, and shells in favor of focusing on how the aviator relating the tale was surprised by Huns shooting him down from above. The image of 'fireflies', initiated in the previous version (Brodsky 13c Verso), is figuratively embellished. More significant in terms of suggesting the progression of these drafts is the introduction of the image of the 'great black earth' in line fifteen. Ultimately, this and the image of the fireflies, representing the air exploding with shells, will be merged metaphorically by Faulkner to symbolize the enemy that does in the pilot. We had been ['raiding over M' del. ] Raiding over Mannheim. Youve seen The place? Then you know How one hangs just beneath the stars, and seems To see the incandescent entrails of the Hun And you doubtless know ['The searchlight gleams' del. ] ['Like wheeling sounds that search the sky for us' del. ] ['And the racket of engines and the slow' del. ] ['Unfolding of the shells' del. ] ['We had released our bombs and started' del. ] The Huns lurking in the high air To drop on us ['[ illeg. ] the spewing of machine guns' del. ] with a spewing of guns and a dance Of tracers like fireflies in a dew laden thicket And the great black earth reaching up hungry hands for us I wonder that any ['of the fel' del. ] people even got back alive Well The boxed To drop on us like wasps around a bat</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky 13b Recto This version of stanza 6 does not bother to repeat the first five lines which Faulkner apparently felt were sufficiently formulated; rather, it restates the firefly image, attempts more narrative, then posits a line which will become instrumental as a refrain for the finished poem: 'There is an end to this somewhere.' Importantly, in the last six lines on the page, Faulkner furthers the image of the 'black earth' and writes what, with minimal change to line three, will become the second half of stanza 6, in the first "complete" pencil draft. And the air was alive with Huns And the great black earth reaching ['after us' del. ] up for us A spewing of guns And a dance Of tracers like fireflies over a deep meadow They boxed us and did us in Three Huns followed ['us,' del. ] after us Until the machine began to break And scream from the speed of falling And I threw away my goggles There is an end to this somewhere I The black earth pulled us down, that night Out of the bullet tortured air That was like ['an enorm' del. ] a great bowl full of fireflies There is an end to this somewhere ['We are too young to die' del. ] One should not die like this</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Virginia ("single torn leaf") Verso This draft of stanza 7 differs from its counterpart in the first "complete" pencil draft in only one major way: it concludes with line nine. Line six adds a dash following the line; line seven appears with the word 'audible' substituted for 'heard'. Otherwise, the stanza is carried forward as Faulkner wrote it on this working draft. One should not die like this His voice has dropped and the wind is mouthing his words While the lilacs nod their heads on slender stalks Agreeing while he talks And cares not if he is heard or is not heard One should not die like this Half heard, half silent words That hover like grey birds About our heads I move suddenly, the birds ['Have flown' del. ] Fly away on [ illeg. del. ] noiseless silver wings</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky 13c Recto This version consists ostensibly of two stanzas. In fact, stanza one is a preliminary working through of what will become stanza 8 in the first "complete" pencil draft. It picks up the second to last line in VIRGINIA "single torn leaf" VERSO, ('I move suddenly, the birds') and modifies it so that the bird image metamorphoses into the 'sun'. Faulkner spends the rest of this first stanza developing the new image, and ends with another specific reference to one of his personae ('poet'), which he will abandon in the finished poem. Stanza two on this page, consisting of 15 lines, with one major change (Faulkner transposes and condenses lines 4, 5, and 6 into two lines), and a few minor word substitutions and additions, becomes stanzas 8 and 9 in the first "complete" pencil draft. We sit in silent thoughtfulness I shiver suddenly, the sun has gone And the air is cooler where we three Sit I can scarcely see ['Them' del. ] And the after glow of the west has followed the sun The light has gone from the worlds rim And the pale lilacs stir against a lilac pale sky The poet bends his head We sit in silent amity I shiver suddenly, the sun has gone And the air is cooler where we three Are sitting. The light has gone from the worlds rim Following the sun And I can scarcely see The stirring of the pale lilacs against the lilac pale sky They bend their heads toward me as one head —Old man—they say—when did you die? I—I am not dead ['They eye each other as people who have committed a gaucherie' del. ] ['In consternation tinged with pity' del. ] I hear their whisper as from a great distance—Not dead Not dead—Poor chap, he isnt dead. We sit, drinking tea</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Virginia "The Lilacs." Autograph manuscript, 3 pages, in pencil. Versos. The manuscript transcribed below is the first "complete" pencil draft on the versos of the entry described in Man Collecting , pp. 20-21. In their description, the editors suggest that this pencil copy, by virtue of its having "only a few varying words" which distinguish it from the fair ink copy on its rectos, might be an unneat or unclean copy Faulkner felt obliged to recopy. Actually, by keying the fair ink copy (F.I.) and the first published version from the June 1925 Double Dealer (D.D.) in a textual collation against this pencil copy, one can see that it clearly represents a distinct progressive step in the creative evolution from experimental pencil drafts to fair ink copy, and that it is decidedly different from the latter. By count, there are 30 lines in the fair ink copy containing key words or phrases altered from their appearance in the pencil draft. Of these, ten have no correlative in the Double Dealer text; another seven of the changes are only minutely different from their counterparts in the Double Dealer text; the title and two lines added originally to the fair ink copy appear almost exactly in the Double Dealer text; and ten more changes appear identically in the Double Dealer text. As a note, since Faulkner dispensed entirely with end-of-line periods in experimental versions as well as pencil and fair ink "complete" copies, their appearance in the Double Dealer version fully punctuated has not been considered collectively as alterations. Finally, it must be emphasized that the 30 alterations in text from pencil to fair ink copies do not necessarily suggest that the fair ink copy represents the final rendition of this poem prior to its official publication; rather that the text is a further step in the development toward a finalized version.

      <field name="fulltext">Brodsky "The Lilacs" (Hand-lettered booklet) This version of the poem, which occupies pages 5-14 of the tiny gift booklet that originally belonged to Phil Stone, and which seems to have been copied out within a little more than a year following the poem's probable initial completion (ca. July—December, 1918), appears to have drawn heavily on the fair ink copy since it retains, with a few obvious line deletions, most of the changes Faulkner made in updating his poem from pencil to ink draft. Most significant, however, are the additions original to this version: they consist of 21 major word, line, syntactical and punctuation alterations from the fair ink version, and all appear in the Double Dealer text. These changes have been collated against the fair ink copy (F.I.) and the Double Dealer (D.D.) text to suggest that the hand-lettered version of "The Lilacs" represents a further working through of the poem. However, this should not be taken to imply that it may have been the final rendition, for in the Double Dealer text Faulkner also harks back to a few lines and words which appear in the fair ink copy and fail to appear in the hand-lettered text (Re: Double Dealer lines 16, 22, 47, 48, 76). In the version of "The Lilacs" transcribed below, the reconstructed text contains pointed brackets which enclose material missing from the booklet because of fire damage. I have refrained from placing suspected punctuation in the bracketed material, although the likelihood of its existence in the undamaged original is great. Also, to augment a more accurate transcription of the poem as it actually appears in the booklet, page numbers are indicated in parentheses to distinguish stanzaic breaks from page breaks arbitrarily necessitated by the booklet's odd size.

In addition, it presents a textual collation of the complete 3-page fair ink autograph manuscript titled "The Lilacs," keyed to the June, 1925 Double Dealer . See also Robert W. Hamblin and Louis Daniel Brodsky, Selections from the William Faulkner Collection of Louis Daniel Brodsky: A Descriptive Catalogue (1979), items 13-13c, 17. For purposes of identification the numbering of these items in this catalogue has been retained. Selections lists three leaves consisting of 5 pages of experimental drafts for "The Lilacs," and a hand-lettered version of the "complete" poem dated "Jan. 1 1920." Also, a photographic reproduction of experimental versions of the opening two stanzas of the published poem (13a) has been printed. 2 All these documents have a common origin: they were originally located in a trunk Faulkner shipped back with him from Toronto in December, 1918, and stored in the attic of his mother's home in Oxford, Mississippi. They remained there intact until shortly after Faulkner's death (his mother, Maud Falkner, predeceased him by only two years) in 1962, when various family members began acquiring artifacts from her house more or less at random. This explains why these and other chronologically related drafts were scattered; it also suggests that other drafts might still exist; especially a leaf or pages containing tentative versions for stanzas 3 and 4. 3 "The Lilacs" first appeared in the Double Dealer , 7 (June 1925), 185-187. Subsequently it was selected and appeared unaltered in Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1925 and Yearbook of American Poetry , ed. William Stanley Braithwaite (1925), pp. 115-118. 4 What exists are the burned remains of a 36-page hand-lettered booklet of poems, with red velvet cover, which Faulkner assembled and presented to Phil Stone. Hand-printed on the title page is: "THE LILACS / W. FAULKNER." The verso of the title page contains a dedication to Stone, and the date, "Jan. 1 1920."

      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Concept of Plating by James L. W. West III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Descriptive bibliographers have been in general agreement about most of the terms they employ since the publication of Fredson Bowers' Principles of Bibliographical Description in 1949. Everyone now knows, or ought to, what edition and impression mean, for example. But in certain areas of bibliographical taxonomy there has been disagreement over terminology. The most noteworthy recent instance was a debate over the elusive concepts of state and issue between James B. Meriwether and Joseph Katz on one side and G. Thomas Tanselle on the other. 1 This paper is addressed to another problem, however, another spot on the chart of bibliographical taxonomy—this one between edition and impression . In Principles , Bowers worked through the history of printing from the fifteenth century to the eighteenth, and in the last hundred odd pages of the volume he covered the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In his opening chapters he established four basic terms for describing and classifying the forms of a published book. These were edition , impression , issue , and state . As Bowers moved into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries he encountered new practices such as American and British publication from the same typesetting, limited editions, monotype rolls, colonial editions, and multiple platings of an edition. Bowers did not introduce new terms to describe these practices; instead, he adapted the four basic terms to cover the new situations. Certainly this decision was correct: in 1949 bibliographical nomenclature was unsettled, and one of the purposes of Principles was to establish a logical and conservative taxonomy. Bibliographical terminology needed to be rescued from the imprecise and careless practices of bookdealers, collectors, and other scholars. Bowers therefore confined his thinking within the framework of edition , impression , issue , and state , creating new terms by adding qualifying words or prefixes, or by combining two terms in a phrasal description. One of the new practices Bowers encountered was plating . He did not address the concept directly, but in his commentary on edition and impression for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries he suggested at least four ways of dealing with plating . These four methods are all more or less satisfactory, and it is not my purpose here to suggest that they be rejected. I do believe, however, that bibliographers of modern books will encounter platings more frequently than Bowers could have predicted in 1949, and that these bibliographers will need a more straightforward and efficient way of dealing with the concept than he provides. In the remarks that follow, I shall attempt to describe a workable method which is essentially an adaptation of Bowers' thinking. 2 Stereotype plating was not much practiced until the early decades of the nineteenth century and did not become widespread until the 1840s. 3 Before that time, editions were printed from standing type, after which the type was distributed. If an edition sold out and more copies were needed, then a new edition had to be set. During the 1830s and 1840s it became common practice to make either plaster or "wet-flong" molds from the standing type and to cast metal plates or "shells" from the resulting matrices. During the 1840s the process of electrotyping also became popular; it was slower and more expensive than the plaster or flong methods but produced a more durable plate. In the twentieth century, plates have been made from a variety of materials—metal, plastic, and even rubber. 4 With a text preserved in plates, the publisher printed a first impression, stored the plates, sold out most of that impression, and then ordered more copies printed from the original plates, thus creating successive impressions of the same edition . In this way the publisher avoided repeating the most time-consuming and expensive part of the printing process—the composition of type. During the nineteenth century publishers found many new outlets for their books, and they began to order much longer press runs. One set of plates was often not enough. Publishers found it inefficient to print all sheets at one location from one set of plates and then to ship those sheets, bound or unbound, to various markets. And plates, especially stereos, had a tendency to wear out on long runs. The solution was to cast multiple sets of plates from the original standing type, or to keep back a set of "mother" plates for a book which was expected to sell widely and to cast sets of plates, as they were needed, from these "mother" plates. Stereos and electros, however, were quite cumbersome. A single plate was a heavy block of wood and/or metal; the plates for a 400- or 500-page book were very bulky and weighty indeed. Storage, handling, reimpression, and shipping cost a good deal and often resulted in heavy batter or damage. The spread of offset printing in this century simplified matters. In order to reproduce a book by photo-offset, all a printer really needs is one copy of the book, though two copies are preferable. Until a few years ago, when the technology changed again, the first impression of a first edition was usually printed from offset or "relief" plates. 5 Various forms of the text—repro proofs, negatives, "blues," flat sheets, unsewn signatures, or bound copies—were later sent to other publishers or book clubs, and new offset platings were made. (After about 1930 many British "editions" of American books were produced in this way.) 6 In the late 1960s most printers stopped using stereotype and electrotype plates altogether and went to photo-offset. Even books which had been composed in hot metal were plated and printed by offset. Repros were pulled from standing type, usually on a power-driven proof press, and these images were photographed for offset reproduction. In general, American trade publishers before about 1970 seem to have used relief plates until a book had exhausted its initial popular sale. Trade copies, sold mostly through bookshops at retail price, had to be well printed; and relief plates make a clearer, darker impression than offset plates. After initial trade sales slowed, the relief plates were usually destroyed, and subsequent impressions were manufactured by offset in order to avoid storage costs for relief plates. This was the case, for example, with The Thurber Carnival , which went through six impressions, from relief plates, from January to April of 1945. The stock of the sixth printing lasted until June 1959, when Harper &amp; Brothers produced a seventh "impression" by offset replating. 7 I have found this same pattern in William Styron's Set This House on Fire (1960) and The Confessions of Nat Turner (1967), and in Reynolds Price's A Long and Happy Life (1962). During the 1970s type was often composed on a tape-driven, computer-driven, or "memory" typewriter, and the images of the letterforms were frequently created by type elements similar to those on IBM typewriters. The technology of type composition has continued to develop quite rapidly, and today most shops use a process that is entirely computerized and photographic. Images of the letterforms are created by exposing film or special paper to light, and these images are transferred to offset plates. Stereos and electros have gone the way of hot metal composition, and there is probably no major printing plant in this country which still casts them. This is not surprising, as the advantages of offset are obvious. Major problems of storage and shipping are avoided, and the text can easily be enlarged or reduced to fit a different format—that for the Modern Library, for instance, or for a "quality" paperback series. The recent development of word processors and optical character readers has created bewildering possibilities. The emphasis today is on capturing the initial key-stroke; the publisher attempts to make the author or his typist double as the compositor. The goal is to typeset or "key" the text only once. Much energy is currently being put into programs which will "interface" the author's word processor with the publisher's composing machine. When that technology becomes generally available, it may have some good side effects. If, for example, a first novelist can present a publisher with camera-ready copy, he can make the publication of his initial effort more feasible commercially, and he may be able to avoid editorial cutting and meddling in the bargain. The possibilities are dizzying, and the bibliographer of modern books will have to deal with them. I believe that he can do so by beginning with the basic methods in Principles and applying his own curiosity and ingenuity. In this paper I shall suggest some ways of dealing with the concept of plating . This discussion will cover the years from about 1840 to 1970. I am not yet prepared to deal with the period after 1970, but the approaches suggested here should be adaptable to the technology currently under development. The main difficulty is simply to keep up. The field is moving ahead so rapidly that nearly all equipment today is outdated by the time it is installed. Bowers suggests four descriptive approaches to the concept of plating . On the first page of his discussion of edition and impression for nineteenth-and twentieth century books, he notes: One cannot ignore the fact that in some large-scale printing of a popular book an impression cannot be limited only to the pieces of paper printed from one set of plates in one printing shop. Books may be printed regionally by simultaneous order for cheaper distribution in the respective parts of the United States. A publisher may have several sets of plates made (some for flat-bed and even some for rotary-press printing) either from the type-setting or from the original set of plates, and the impression of the sheets may be made by several printing shops and different kinds of presses. Each of these literally constitutes a separate impression but cannot be treated as such bibliographically. The sheets would be indistinguishable in most cases and perhaps indiscriminately bound. No record would be kept for identifying copies printed in any specific shop. The publisher treats these sheets as his single impression, and there is nothing for it but to follow him. When distinguishable, they can be noted as states of a general impression . [ Principles , p. 379] Bowers's approach is sensible and practical. But what of those cases in which it is possible to differentiate sheets printed from different sets of plates? One can certainly treat these as separate impressions, no matter what the publisher does. Elsewhere Bowers is reluctant to follow the common terminology of publishers, as in refusing to use edition loosely to mean impression , but here he simply notes that "there is nothing for it but to follow [the publisher's practice]." Bowers' compromise term for cases in which the sheets are distinguishable is states of a general impression . But in every sense of the term that I understand, these are separate impressions —if one can identify them. Offset replating is handled by Bowers in a different way. On p. 382 he suggests facsimile impression as a working taxon, but here he seems to have in mind a modern offset reproduction of an old text—say, a 1965 facsimile of the 1798 text of Lyrical Ballads . In more complicated situations Bowers suggests, for the sake of clarity, that the replating be called an impression but be qualified by a term within parentheses in such a description as second (offset) impression . This term—again an adaptation of one of the four basic words—is admittedly imprecise because the actual impression of ink onto paper is not made in both cases by the same physical "object," whether it be a forme of type, a relief plate, or an offset blanket. The term (offset) impression still conveys the message, however, and functions satisfactorily for a book with a simple history of offset replating. The most useful taxon for dealing with the concept of plating is Bowers' term subsidiary edition or sub-edition . Bowers uses the term most often to record a difference in publishing auspices. He recognizes that "it is necessary to conceive not only of impressions with their issues but also of a family of subsidiary editions stemming from the parent edition type-setting, some having a direct line of descent, others a collateral. The editions in both these latter branches are identified by suitable descriptive titles which broaden the old terms to take account of the complexities attending machine-printing. Each member edition of this family tree may have its own impressions" (pp. 382-383). Bowers uses sub-edition in a great many circumstances, including "cheap editions," colonial editions, editions by other publishers, revised editions, enlarged editions, and limited editions (those printed from the parent typesetting and bound up before the "trade edition"). He emphasizes that the scholar must be "precise in a bibliography about the origin of a subsidiary edition" (p. 384), and it is therefore in the notes that the bibliographer would record the occurence of plating and replating. This approach works satisfactorily for books with a simple history of plating but is not as efficient in more complicated situations. Too, the root word of sub-edition is edition , a term which implies that type has been reset. With replating no type is reset unless corrections or other small alterations are made. Indeed the main reason for replating is to avoid the resetting of type. Any term in a system of bibliographical nomenclature will work at a given spot so long as everyone agrees on a reasonably strict definition of that term and thereafter uses it consistently. We could therefore in theory all agree to use states of a general impression or facsimile impression or (offset) impression or sub-edition to describe platings and replatings, so long as we always specified carefully the circumstances under which publication occurred. But bibliographical terms, if they are to gain general acceptance, should if possible describe what actually happens at the printing shop. The current terminology does not do so. The problem is that the old terms— states of a general impression , facsimile impression , (offset) impression , and sub-edition —all use as their root or base words either edition or impression , and those two words carry mental associations for a bibliographer which are inappropriate to what the printer has actually done. A new term would be helpful. I should like to propose that bibliographers experiment with the term plating as a step between edition and impression . 8 The word is accurate because it describes what the printer has done: he has made a set of plates. A plating should be defined as "all copies of a book printed from a single set of relief or offset plates." Once the concept is grasped it becomes easy to distinguish the first plating of the first edition from the third plating of the first edition . Similarly one can differentiate between the first impression of the first plating and the third impression of that same plating. It would also be useful to distinguish whether platings were relief or offset. If one has the information, he can even record whether the plates were stereotype, electrotype, or flexographic. If the bibliographer treats all platings in a single chronological line of descent, he can insert the descriptive term within parentheses. He might, for example, distinguish the second plating of the second edition (offset) from the third plating of the second edition (electrotype) . On the other hand the bibliographer might want to trace a separate line of descent for each method of plating. He then might dispense with parentheses and speak of the first stereotype plating of the first edition as distinct from the first offset plating of the first edition . More likely he will wish to separate the American and English publication histories. He can then distinguish the first American plating (relief) from the first English plating (offset) , being careful to note that the English publication is a sub-edition of the original American typesetting, and that the image of the British plating derives from the American text. The printing history of a given book will dictate a bibliographer's decisions on these matters. Each plating can have its own chain of impressions under any arrangement. The bibliographer of books printed in the eighteenth century or before will have no reason to use plating ; he will continue to employ edition , impression , issue , and state in the old way. But the bibliographer of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books can insert plating as a step between edition and impression for those books which were plated and replated during their publication histories. If plating did not occur (or he cannot prove that it occurred), then the bibliographer will simply use edition , impression , issue , and state as he always has. If he does use plating , he need not adjust his definitions of the other four terms in any way. If he suspects that replating has occurred but cannot prove it, he should use the four basic terms and record his suspicions in a note. How does one identify a plating or replating? First, one should attempt to consult the publisher's records. If these do not survive or are off limits, however, one can still detect platings from physical evidence (and one should always check the physical evidence in any case to be sure that it confirms what the publisher's records say). First one must learn to differentiate offset printing from letterpress. In books printed from standing type or relief plates, one can usually discern slight indentations where the inked letters have struck the paper. The indentations will often be visible if the pages of the book are held at an angle to a strong light. 9 There are no such indentations with offset printing, and an experienced pressman can tell the difference by running his fingers across the pages of a book. Offset printing sometimes leaves a distinguishing mark called "offset slur," a blurring of the letters which results from slippage between the offset blanket and the paper. 10 If, by using these methods, one discovers that early impressions are from letterpress or relief plates and later impressions are from offset plates, then one has evidence of offset replating. Stereotype plating also leaves distinctive physical evidence. If either the plaster or the "wet-flong" method was used, a slight reduction in the dimensions of the type page will have been caused by shrinkage of the cast. This difference can usually be detected by measuring multiple copies of a book. For example, the type page of a first printing from standing type will be slightly larger than the type page of later printings from stereos. Shrinkage is proportional to the size of the type page: approximately one to two millimeters of shrinkage in width will have resulted for a page that is 90 mm wide, for example, or two to four millimeters in height for a page that is 170 mm high. A larger page will show greater shrinkage, a smaller page less shrinkage. 11 When all plates were cast by the same method from one unused set of "mother" plates, however, or when multiple sets of plates were cast from the original standing type (itself never used for printing), then no significant variation will be found. Too, neither the "dry-flong" method (in general use by 1910) nor the electrotyping process created any discernible reduction in the size of the type page; multiple platings produced by these methods are therefore impossible to differentiate one from the other, unless one finds evidence of a different kind. 12 Fortunately, such evidence is often present. Sometimes one will assemble a run of impressions—the first through the tenth, let us say—and will note the usual increase in type wear and batter from impression to impression. Then, surprisingly, the text of the eleventh printing will be crisp and batter-free. Or in similar fashion, one will discover textual variants between the first and tenth printings and then will find, in the eleventh printing, a reversion to the text of the first printing. 13 Such evidence probably indicates that a new set of plates has been cast, or was cast at the same time as the first set and is now being put into use. 14 Sometimes the stereotype or electrotype plates were cast with two or more pages to a single plate, and these plates were themselves signed for a particular format. In such cases, resigning or other evidence of reimposition may indicate replating. This evidence is not always reliable, however, because printers would often cast (and sign) these plates for more than one imposition pattern. Also, it was a simple matter for a printer to knock off the old signature markings and mortise in new ones on an old set of plates. The bibliographer can also detect the presence of plating by examining the repairs made to damaged type. Peter L. Shillingsburg has described what one should look for: First, although corrections of movable type often affect the spacing between other words in a line, plate corrections usually did not because inter-word spacing was fixed in the solid metal of the plate. Second, corrections of movable type tend to be aligned horizontally with the rest of the line because the type could easily seek its own alignment; plate corrections usually resulted in slight misalignment of the substituted matter because the original had to be chiseled off to make room for the substitution, and this process is difficult to perform accurately. Third, letters dropped from movable type provide space in the locked form that allows neighboring characters to shift position, especially at the ends of lines; plate damage in the same positions does not permit this kind of drift because, again, the plate is a solid mass of metal. 15 Offset replating can be detected in several different ways. If the size of the type page has been significantly enlarged or reduced between offset impressions, then replating must necessarily have taken place. Variations of a millimeter or less are insignificant, but larger differences usually indicate replating. If there is evidence of reimposition between two books printed by offset methods, then replating must have occurred. If collation on a Hinman or Lindstrand machine turns up variants, then replating has occurred, at least for the plates on which the variants appear. Any change in gutter or register measurement between books printed by offset is also evidence of replating. 16 The distance between pages on an offset plate (which normally reproduces an entire forme on a single sheet of metal) cannot be altered once the plate is created. Differences in gutter and register measurements in books printed from relief plates, however, do not indicate replating. Measurements can be altered between these plates when two or more of them are on the press at once. Even in the middle of a run, a pressman can add furniture or tighten the chase, thus altering the gutter or register measurements in the gathered and bound books. All of these methods of identification are fallible. I have only tried to suggest the general kinds and combinations of evidence the bibliographer should look for. Offset replating creates problems for bibliographers because it gives the author and his publisher a chance easily to make changes in the text of a book. Textual alterations were often made in stereotype or electrotype plates: old type was chiseled off and new type was soldered in. Publishers and authors for years had readings changed in this way to correct typos, to perform small-scale alterations in the text of a book, or to censor or expurgate it after publication. The same thing can be done with an offset replating. In fact, it is a simpler process with offset repro copy than with relief plates. All the publisher need do is identify the type font used for setting the book and find a shop which has that font, or one nearly like it. Then the publisher can have the erroneous lines reset with correct spellings or the offensive lines reset with inoffensive words. The reset lines must be the same length as the old ones if the type page is to remain justified; otherwise, large blocks of text must be reset. But extensive resetting is sometimes done if the publisher wants badly enough to change the text. Once the lines have been reset, the printer need only take scissors and paste and strip in the new lines over the old ones on his repro copy. He can then shoot negatives, make new offset plates, and go to press. 17 This is what happened to the British edition of William Styron's Set This House on Fire . The printing history of this novel is worth examining in some detail, because it shows how pervasive the practice of offset replating has become in modern publishing, and because it affords an opportunity to test the workability of the plating concept. The first two trade printings of Set This House on Fire were published by Random House in 1960, from relief plates. The book was then replated four times by photo-offset: once in 1960 by the Book Find Club, again in 1961 by Hamish Hamilton in London, again in 1970 by Jonathan Cape in London, and a fourth time in 1971 by Random House itself (which had melted down its relief plates after the second trade printing). The 1970 Cape plating is of particular interest because Cape did not go back to one of the Random House impressions for repro copy. Instead Cape used copies of the Hamish Hamilton text. This created a problem, because back in 1961 Hamilton had used cut-and-paste methods to censor its text of Set This House on Fire . The novel contains a fair number of four-letter words, but curiously these were not what the Hamilton editor expunged. Rather, he was offended by the word "bleeding." Cass Kinsolving, hero of Set This House on Fire , is windy and bombastic and often speaks in overblown language. "Triple bleeding God," and variants thereof, are his favorite oaths. Most Americans would not find such oaths offensive; in fact, there are other off-color words in the book, curses that Hamilton left uncensored, which would probably bother a conservative American reader more. But Hamilton concentrated on "bleeding" and "triple bleeding," perhaps because England is a heavily Anglican country and surely because "bloody" is a strong word there, or at least still was in 1961. So in the Hamilton plating, "Triple bleeding God" became "God Almighty," as did "Bleeding Savior" and "Bleeding God." "Thrice-punctured Christ" was entirely removed, as was "triple bleeding horseshit." And "Sweet bleeding Father" became simply "Sweet Father." A few other strong lines were toned down—the old Southern expression "grinning like a shit-eating dog" became "grinning like a big hairy dog," for instance—but for the most part the expurgations were aimed at modification or removal of the word "bleeding." In 1970 Jonathan Cape, Styron's second British publisher, made a new offset replating of Set This House on Fire from the censored Hamish Hamilton text, after first pasting in a few more misguided corrections. The Cape book is thus a second-generation, expurgated, twice-altered, offset replating. The diagram in Figure I shows how the text of Set This House on Fire was transmitted from plating to plating. This diagram, however, records the transmission of the image of the text; it does not properly trace its publication history. In a descriptive bibliography, it would be much better to separate the American publication history distinctly from the British. The entry for Set This House on Fire would then be arranged in this fashion: FIRST AMERICAN EDITION First American Plating (Relief): First Impression, March 1960. Second Impression, Sept. 1960, Random House, 1960. (Plated from standing type) Second American Plating (Offset): with corrections. Book Find Club, 1960. (Sub-edition of Random House type-setting, derived from the first American plating, first impression) First Impression, July 1960. Third American Plating (Offset): Random House, 1971. (Derived from the first American plating, corrected second impression) First Impression, March 1971. FIRST ENGLISH "EDITION" First English Plating (Offset): Hamish Hamilton, 1961. (Sub-edition of Random House type-setting, derived from the first American plating, first impression, with expurgations by Hamilton) First Impression, February 1961. Second English Plating (Offset): Jonathan Cape, 1970. (Sub-edition of Random House type-setting, but derived from the Hamish Hamilton plating, first impression, and with further textual alterations by Cape) First Impression, January 1970. Increasingly in modern books, the American and British manufacturing histories overlap or derive from one another, and the bibliographer must record these interrelationships. A good example is Cape's offset replating of the 1967 Random House edition of The Confessions of Nat Turner . This Cape book is a bibliographical curio. Before shooting negatives, Cape made twenty-seven changes in the Random House text, some justified but others of questionable value, such as those designed to "correct" Nat's Negro slave dialect. These alterations came to light when the first printing of the Cape plating was machine-collated against the first impression of the first Random House plating. But numerous other variants also surfaced, and the pattern of variation was strange. I had assumed that the Cape plating would derive from a single Random House trade printing, and I was curious to know which one because Random House had introduced some thirty-eight changes in its own plates between the first and sixth trade impressions. After analyzing the variants, I concluded that Cape had used two copies of the Random House text, one a first printing and the other a fourth printing (which varied from the first printing at fourteen points). I believed that the two copies had been disbound and that pages had been selected at random from one or the other for pasting up camera copy. I was wrong, however: the variants actually broke down according to inner and outer formes. 18 Random House therefore probably did not send two copies, but two sets of sheets to Cape for photoreproduction. This would have been an advantage for the British printers; they would not have had to decide on an imposition pattern or arrange and align the separate pages for shooting. One set sent by Random House was apparently from the first impression, the other from the fourth impression. One suspects that a single set of sheets from the first impression (September 1967) was sent to Cape shortly after Cape contracted to publish the book in England. The Cape printers, however, must have wanted a second set. By that time Nat Turner , a bestseller in America, was probably into its fourth trade impression (23 October 1967), and a set of sheets was pulled from that impression and sent to Cape. As a result Cape produced an odd text which includes some of the corrections that had been made in the American relief plates, prints some independent changes which are found only in its text, and preserves from the first impression some errors that Random House had already corrected. 19 There are an almost infinite number of variations one can play on the plating theme. One can devise, in the abstract, some truly curious bibliographical situations involving wet-flong molds, stereotype plates, censoring, and offset replating. I believe that the concept of plating can be used for something besides bibliographical parlor games, however, and I suggest that scholars experiment seriously with the term. For the description of modern books it is a helpful taxon; I hope that its acceptance and use will spread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * An early version of this paper was presented at the Modern Language Association Convention, Methods of Literary Research Section, San Francisco, 1979. I wish to thank Craig S. Abbott, Peter L. Shillingsburg, and G. Thomas Tanselle for reading subsequent drafts and giving valuable advice. 1 Meriwether and Katz, "A Redefinition of 'Issue,'" Proof , 2 (1972), 61-70; Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 17-66. 2 Bowers has made other comments on plates and multiple plating in "Old Wine in New Bottles: Problems of Machine Printing," Editing Nineteenth Century Texts , ed. John M. Robson (1967), pp. 11-12, and in the textual introduction to the Ohio State Centenary edition of Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables (1965), pp. xxix-xxxiii. The final eight-page gathering of the first printing of the 1851 first edition of Hawthorne's novel was plated twice in order for the printer to impose these plates in a sixteen-page forme. 3 For a summary of the history of stereotype and electrotype plating, see Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography , corrected ed. (1974), pp. 201-206. 4 The latter two materials are used to make "flexographic" plates which are employed with quick-drying inks on rotary presses. 5 A "relief" plate is a plate from which the ink is transferred directly to the paper by raised letterforms made of metal, rubber, or plastic. Offset plates, by contrast, are chemically treated so that the areas one wishes to reproduce will pick up ink and the other areas will reject it. The offset plate is wrapped around a cylinder; it transfers the inked image to a rubber "blanket" cylinder which in turn "offsets" it on the paper carried by the impression cylinder. 6 The earliest literary text that I know to have been photo-offset for British publication is Faulkner's Sartoris , published in America by Harcourt, Brace in 1929 and in London by Chatto and Windus in 1932. The Sound and the Fury and Sanctuary were both reset for British release the year before, but in both cases the English publisher probably reset the type in part to censor and otherwise tamper with Faulkner's text. In 1926 the original plates, or duplicates, for Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby were shipped to England where Chatto and Windus struck off its own impression. Tender is the Night was completely reset for English publication in 1934. James Gould Cozzens's novels through Guard of Honor (1949) were reset for British release, but his last three books were photo-offset in London by Longmans, Green. The turning point would seem to have come sometime in the late 1930s, but there is still no standard practice: as late as 1962 Chatto and Windus had the text of Reynolds Price's A Long and Happy Life completely reset; in 1967 the same firm published an offset replating of his novel A Generous Man ; in 1971 they imported sewn gatherings of Permanent Errors from Price's American publisher (Atheneum) and had them case-bound in England, though the endpapers had been affixed in this country. 7 Edwin T. Bowden, James Thurber: A Bibliography (1968), pp. 49-60. 8 So far as I am aware my compilation William Styron: A Descriptive Bibliography (1977) was the first published bibliography to use the term plating , but I did not originate the concept. It was suggested to me in 1974 by Joseph Katz, and in that same year Katz showed me working drafts of David Farmer's bibliography of Flannery O'Connor in which Farmer was differentiating the platings of O'Connor's books. 9 See Kenneth Povey, "The Optical Identification of First Formes," Studies in Bibliography , 13 (1960), 189-190. 10 Craig S. Abbott, "Offset Slur as Bibliographical Evidence," PBSA , 70 (1976), 539. 11 Peter L. Shillingsburg, "Detecting the Use of Stereotype Plates," Editorial Quarterly , 1 (1975), 2-3. 12 Sometimes a reduction in the dimensions of the type page was caused by printing on wet paper, which shrank as it dried. Such shrinkage had nothing to do with plating, but it might be a source of difficulty for the bibliographer looking for evidence of plating. One way of detecting this kind of shrinkage is to realize that it normally occurred most heavily along the grain of the paper. Thus the type page was reduced more in one dimension than in the other. See David J. Nordloh, "Plates and Publishing-Housekeeping: Some Aspects of Howells's Venetian Life ," Serif , 8 (1971), 29-31. 13 Matthew J. Bruccoli describes one such occurrence in "Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt ," SB , 11 (1958), 263-268. See also Bruccoli's "A Mirror for Bibliographers: Duplicate Plates in Modern Printing," PBSA , 54 (1960), 83-88. 14 But it can also sometimes indicate that early-printed sheets, at the bottom of the stacks, are only now being bound up. 15 Shillingsburg, "Stereotype Plates," p. 3. Shillingsburg has done much research into the bibliographical problems caused by relief plating; see his "The Printing, Proof-reading, and Publishing of Thackeray's Vanity Fair : The First Edition," SB , 34 (1981), 118-145; and his "Collating Machines and 19th-Century Printed Books," Direction Line , no. 10 (Winter 1980), 4-7. 16 For gutter measurement see Bruccoli, "Concealed Printings in Hawthorne," PBSA , 57 (1963), 42-49; for register measurement see Shillingsburg, "Register Measurement as a Method of Detecting Hidden Printings," PBSA , 73 (1979), 484-488. 17 When Scribner's reissued Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned in 1958 they made such repairs, correcting three misspellings and altering some seventy-five hyphens, mostly by opaquing them out on the repro copy. See Matthew J. Bruccoli, "Bibliographical Notes on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned ," SB , 13 (1960), 258-261. 18 Craig S. Abbott discovered the pattern in preparing his review of the Styron bibliography for Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography , 2 (1978), 230-235. Mr. Abbott has very kindly sent his calculations to me. 19 The reader will note that the various offset replatings of Set This House on Fire and Nat Turner have all been used for only one impression. This may be because all but one of these replatings involve British publication. Styron's writings have never been especially popular in England, and there may have been no need to reprint. But it may also be true that printers do not save offset plates for later impressions in the same way that they once warehoused stereos and electros. Metal offset plates are difficult to store and can be damaged by scoring and scratching. The printers to whom I have talked tell me that the image of a text is often preserved in negatives, sometimes in a hanging file for large shots, sometimes on a roll that resembles microfilm. The bibliographer of modern offset books may therefore find that he needs to organize the printing history of his author's titles around photographic shootings , not offset platings . See John P. Dessauer, Book Publishing: What It Is, What It Does (1974), pp. 80-81.</field>
