      <field name="heading_text">Editorial Problems -- A Preliminary Survey * by R. C. BALD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"BY COMMON CONSENT THE CONSTITUTION OF an author's text is the highest aim that a scholar can set before himself." 1 This, as one might guess, is the dictum of a classical scholar, and a classical scholar is far more acutely conscious than a student of the modern literatures that for over two thousand years the preservation and elucidation of the texts of the great writers have been the primary concern of literary study. Yet to many, and not to lay minds alone, textual criticism is an arid activity, almost synonymous with pedantry. Nevertheless, the text must be established before a just critical appraisal is possible, as a simple illustration will make clear. The 13th of Donne's Holy Sonnets is one of the better known of his Divine Poems . It begins, What if this present were the worlds last night? Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell, The picture of Christ crucified, and tell Whether that countenance can thee affright. In all the editions before Grierson's the poem concluded: so I say to thee To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd, This beauteous form assumes a pitious mind, but Grierson, on the authority of the manuscripts, altered "assumes" to "assures." "Assumes" gives the poem the flatness of a geometrical demonstration, even though it might be argued that the word would come naturally enough from one so soaked as Donne in the dialectic of scholastic philosophy. "Assures," on the other hand, alters the whole effect of the poem and brings it to the triumphant climax which Donne surely intended. The present disrepute of textual criticism, it would seem, arises from an excessive faith in our mechanical means of reproducing books. We take our texts on trust. Modern scholarship, Dr. R. W. Chapman has remarked, seems to proceed on the assumption that the texts of books published after 1700 are sound, or, if not, that "it is useless, if not improper, to correct them." But, he continues, "The first position has only to be stated to reveal its absurdity; every book, every newspaper, reminds us of human fallibility. The second position . . . arises from cowardice." 2 Whether due to indifference or cowardice, textual corruption can go unchecked for a surprisingly long time, and can produce some very disconcerting results. Let me illustrate. A correspondent in The Times Literary Supplement not long ago pointed out that the very titles of certain books, quite frequently reprinted, have been altered, and the original titles almost forgotten. How many readers of Dickens, for instance, know that The Adventures of Oliver Twist: or, The Parish Boy's Progress is the title which the author gave his novel? And if title pages are so unreliable, what can be expected of the text? An examination of modern reprints of Tristram Shandy revealed widespread divergences from Sterne's final text: Errors in punctuation amount on many pages to 15 to 20 to the page. . . . Modern reprints have frequently set in lower case words which Sterne required to be set in small capitals. Alterations in spelling have not been confined to modernizations; . . . errors destroying Sterne's sense and meaning have been perpetuated, like area for aera, clause for cause, port for post, timber for tinder, catching for catechising , and caravans for caverns . 3 Many of these errors apparently originated in some popular nineteenth-century reprint, and have been repeated ever since. Another class of book in which textual laxity is frequent is one in which, theoretically, it should be rarest: the textbook. Textbooks profess to be edited by competent scholars, and should thus be in a class quite apart from the popular reprint, mass-produced as economically as possible. It would be easy to cite examples of indifferent, scissors-and-paste editing, and even of culpable carelessness, but it will be more effective to refer to books otherwise immune from the ordinary criticism of slipshod work. Within the past year or so two new college Shakespeares have appeared, 4 whose editors are perhaps the two most active and distinguished Shakespearian scholars in the country. For range and interest of material presented in introductions and notes, the two books are a marked improvement on anything previously available, and they are bound to exert a strong influence on the teaching of Shakespeare for a generation or so. Yet both reproduce the Globe text. It is not as if there had been no advances in the textual study of Shakespeare during the present century, nor are these two editors ignorant of the work of Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Dover Wilson; but is there any other branch of study in which a teacher would be satisfied to present students, as these books do, with the results achieved by scholarship up to, but not beyond, the year 1864? A third example may be given to show how neglect of textual matters may distort or nullify an argument. In a recent investigation into the origins and development of what we call the Victorian attitude of mind the Reverend Thomas Bowdler's Family Shakespeare almost inevitably came up for discussion. In I Henry IV , it was alleged, Bowdler showed a certain squeamishness about Falstaff's oaths, though, rather surprisingly, he was somewhat erratic in his elimination of them. "Zounds," "'Sblood," "By the Lord," and "By the mass" are frequently omitted, and in one place "God" is replaced by "heaven." 5 But such omissions and substitutions were not due to Bowdler at all. The more forcible expressions are all found, it is true, in most modern editions, and they also appear in the early quartos, but they do not appear in the First Folio. This half-hearted censorship of Shakespeare's text took place in the theatre, and was the result of the Act of 1606 which forbade the profane "use of the holy name of God or of Jesus Christ or of the Holy Ghost or of the Trinitie" on the stage; Bowdler was merely working from an eighteenth-century text of Shakespeare based on the First Folio, and in actual fact did not concern himself in any way with Falstaff's oaths. If, then, we are aware of the value of textual studies, we must pay them more than lip service, and no scholar is properly trained unless he knows something of the mechanics of preparing a text. In the remarks which follow I shall confine myself to English texts from the period of the Renaissance onwards, that is, to the age of the printed book, since the texts of the manuscript age are to be the subject of another paper in this series. A distinction between the texts of the manuscript age and those of the age of the printed book is fully justified. I am aware, of course, that certain early texts and editions have survived in unique exemplars, and that the twelve surviving copies of the first edition of King Lear contain ten different combinations of corrected and uncorrected sheets, so that such texts may present problems closely analogous to those of texts found only in manuscript. In the main, however, it is true to say that the printed book presents the text in a fixed and standardized form, whereas every manuscript is unique, and its value as an authority for the text must be separately investigated. Although there have been authors, from Ben Jonson in Shakespeare's day to Housman in our own, who have been extremely meticulous about the form in which their work has appeared in print, most of the conventions of English spelling and punctuation are the creation of printers and compositors, especially in the seventeenth century. Most authors, provided their words and sense have been accurately reproduced, have been content to have current printers' usage superimposed upon their writings. In other words, though a manuscript copied out fair to be sent to the publisher may represent the work in its final form as far as the author is concerned, it is not necessarily yet in the form in which it will be offered to the reader, or in which the author expects it to be offered. Thus Wordsworth sent the copy for the second edition of Lyrical Ballads to Humphry Davy, requesting him before the manuscript went to press to adjust the punctuation—"a business in which I am ashamed to say I am not adept." Similarly the manuscript of his Ode on Intimations of Immortality (first published in the Poems of 1807), which is in the handwriting of his sister-in-law Sara Hutchinson with notes and corrections in Wordsworth's hand, has had emphatic changes in capitalization and punctuation added, presumably by a reader at the publisher's. 6 Coleridge's Friend may be cited for another example. The manuscript is extant, partly in Coleridge's hand, but mainly in Sara Hutchinson's. It was originally printed by a provincial printer at Penrith, with the result that the first edition reproduces many of the eccentricities of spelling, punctuation, italicization, and capitalization of Coleridge and his amanuensis. A few years later, when a revised edition was brought out in London, most of these eccentricities were normalized. By comparison with the edition of 1818 the original edition looks more like a piece of eighteenth than of nineteenth-century typography, but there is no shred of evidence that Coleridge concerned himself in any way with the typographical practice of either printer. Although authors have frequently shown no care for such minutiae , or "accidentals," as Dr. Greg calls them, they are of some concern to the editor, and his treatment of them will in large measure be determined by the nature of the edition he is preparing. For our purposes we may distinguish between three classes of editions: (1) the modern-spelling edition, (2) the old-spelling edition; and (3) the facsimile edition, sometimes called the diplomatic edition. 7 There will always be, one hopes, editions in modern spelling of the major English authors since Spenser. Chaucer can only be modernized by altering his language, and Spenser, with his deliberately cultivated archaisms, is also separated from us by a linguistic gulf, narrow and easily crossed, but none the less real. But if ever the day comes when no modernized editions of Shakespeare and Donne and Milton are available to the general reader, our cultural heritage will be in a sad state. The responsibility of the editor of a text in modern spelling is no less than that of him who edits in the old spelling; if anything, it is greater. Nor is the task any lighter; in fact, the editor of one such work, who had no modernized text already made for him, writes in his preface that the task of modernization had convinced him "that Elizabethan editors save themselves a vast deal of trouble and risk by adhering to the original spelling and punctuation." 8 Yet, in this particular case at least, the undertaking was well worth while, bringing as it did a great deal of otherwise inaccessible material within the range of the ordinary reader, who would have been easily repelled by the apparent remoteness and strangeness of the originals. The aim of the facsimile reprint is to provide the most accurate substitute for a rare original that typography can supply. Those who contemplate the preparation of such a text will find the principles to be followed set out in the "Rules for Editors" drawn up for the Malone Society. But with the development of cheap photographic processes the facsimile reprint will be less and less in demand, except on those occasions where it is desirable to furnish a literatim transcript of a manuscript, either to preserve the peculiarities of an individual writer or to aid those unskilled in palaeography, as in a work like Greg's English Literary Autographs , 1550-1650. The old-spelling text is of course requisite in any standard or definitive edition. After the copy-text has been chosen, the editor reproduces it faithfully except for such corrections as he finds it necessary to make. The copy-text will usually be either the first (authorized) edition, or the last to receive the author's revision; the editorial corrections will involve such matters as the elimination of misprints, the adjustment in poetry of faulty verse-lining, the correction of inadequate punctuation, the incorporation of manifestly superior (and authentic) readings from other editions, and the emendation of corrupt passages. The rationale of such editorial procedure has been fully discussed and set forth by McKerrow and Greg, and one can usually find in their writings a solution for one's difficulties. 9 Thanks to these and to other scholars, current editorial practice is fairly clearly defined, but I should like to emphasize that many editors will sooner or later find themselves face to face with problems or with materials that demand treatment different from that worked out by classical scholars or even by editors of Shakespeare, and I propose briefly to survey some of these and indicate their consequence for an editor. In recent years it has become clear that in the seventeenth century certain authors cared sufficiently for textual accuracy not to rest content with printed errata slips, but had manuscript corrections made in as many copies of their works as possible. Such autograph corrections by Sir Thomas Browne and Izaak Walton are now well known, but they were by no means the only authors to resort to this device. Even the plays of such minor court dramatists as Sir William Berkeley and Sir William Lower are known to contain manuscript corrections by or at the instigation of the authors, and editors should constantly be on the watch for other instances. Obviously such corrections are of the highest textual importance. Other classes of material throw light on the earlier history of a work, and no one, 10 I fancy, will dispute the fact that one of the functions of a definitive edition is to illuminate as much as possible the origin and development of the work edited. Every student of the Romantic Period, for instance, knows something of the fascinating struggle for artistic perfection revealed by Keats's manuscripts, or of the information about the development of Wordsworth's thought and art furnished by the new Oxford edition. Many writers, too, have constantly revised their writings after the first publication; sometimes the extent of revision can be shown by recording the readings of the successive editions, but often the revisions are so thorough that there is no alternative but to print all the versions or, if not all, at least the first and final ones. Examples that come to mind immediately are Whitman's Leaves of Grass , whose problems were discussed here several years ago, 11 or Fitzgerald's successive versions of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam . But these are by no means solitary instances. Among the Elizabethans, Daniel and Drayton revised throughout their careers. In the eighteenth century Pope wrote The Rape of the Lock in two forms, and left two Dunciads . In the nineteenth century both Wordsworth and Tennyson completely rewrote some of their early poems, and Coleridge reworked The Rime of the Ancient Mariner from 1798 until his death. Nor are poets the only revisers. While English literature can scarcely furnish a parallel equal in interest and importance to the case of Montaigne's Essays in French, the two versions of Sidney's Arcadia , the successive editions of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy , and of Walton's Lives involve problems scarcely less complex. The bulk of authors' manuscripts, first drafts, and work sheets that has survived may sometimes by very considerable indeed. The most famous of such documents is of course the collection of Milton's manuscripts preserved at Trinity College, Cambridge. But there is scarcely a major author since the beginning of the eighteenth century of whose work some manuscripts have not survived. Such materials are not necessarily of primary textual authority, since they may consist of early drafts, or the author may have made his final revisions in proof; but they can be of utmost importance in correcting the text, as a simple example will make clear. The epigraph to the second chapter of The Heart of Midlothian consists of two stanzas from Prior's The Thief and the Cordelier . In the novel one of the lines reads There the squire of the poet and knight of the post, which is nonsense. It should be There the squire of the pad and the knight of the post. This example is unusual, because there is the possibility of a double check. Not only do the texts of Prior give the right reading, but Scott's manuscript, which is extant, shows that he quoted the passage correctly. Nevertheless this printer's error was repeated in all editions until 1948. 12 Two other similar classes of material that have as yet been scarcely used by editors should also be noticed: printer's copy and author's proofs. Printer's copy and proof-sheets have both survived from as early as the fifteenth century; in neither of these instances, however, was the author involved. But even a brief enumeration of some of the surviving manuscripts which were sent by the authors to the press is an impressive one, including as it does Book I of Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity , part of Sir John Harington's translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso , Book I of Paradise Lost , Pope's Essay on Criticism , the second edition of Lyrical Ballads , and Wordsworth's Poems of 1807. The Bodleian manuscript of Herbert's Temple , though not sent to the press, is the one bearing the imprimatur of the official licenser, and is therefore of textual authority at least equal to that of the first edition. Of author's proofs I know of no actual examples earlier than some of Dr. Johnson's in the R. B. Adam Collection, and the earliest I happen myself to have examined were of works by Hazlitt and Scott, but there must be many others in existence awaiting full examination by interested scholars. A further class of material offering editorial problems of its own is to be found in those manuscripts, such as letters, diaries, and notebooks, which were never prepared for the press by the authors, and were never intended for the press. Editors, and especially biographer-editors, have allowed themselves a latitude in handling such materials that varies all the way from a naive desire to safeguard the hero's dignity to flagrant dishonesty. One of the earliest writers to suffer from such editorial ineptitude was Donne. His son in editing his letters not only showed extreme carelessness over dates and addresses but, it is now known, altered the names of those to whom the letters were written, presumably in order to suggest that he had access to a much greater volume of his father's correspondence than in fact he had. 13 Even Walton was not above tampering with Donne's letters, so that on one occasion he strung together excerpts from five different letters, clapped a date on the end, and presented the result as a single epistle. 14 My colleague Professor W. M. Sale tells me that Samuel Richardson's letters were similarly mishandled by Mrs. Barbauld, and other examples from eighteenth and nineteenth-century biographies could doubtless be found with little difficulty. Many of these earlier editorial mutilations are explicable in terms of the standards of their age. Two of Donne's letters seem to have survived only in the opening and close; the intermediate news or business communication, or whatever it was, has been omitted. 15 His contemporaries were interested in the elegance of Donne's epistolary style and the ingenuity of his compliments more than in the details of his personal relations with his friends. Nineteenth-century taboos were responsible for a different kind of excision altogether; witness those, for instance, in the early editions of Lamb's letters. One recalls how Lamb wrote to Thomas Manning about the little book on honours and dignities which he had written for children, 16 and how in the course of it he had envisaged himself advancing through all the degrees of the peerage, concluding with "Duke Lamb." It would look like quibbling [he continued] to carry it on further . . . otherwise I have sometimes in my dreams imagined myself still advancing, as 9th, King Lamb; 10th, Emperor Lamb; 11th, Pope Innocent, higher than which is nothing upon earth. At least, that is what appeared in the nineteenth-century editions; what Lamb actually wrote was "higher than which is nothing but the Lamb of God." Coleridge, who left behind him vast stores of marginalia, notes, scattered papers, and other disjecta membra , has given much trouble to his editors. Henry Nelson Coleridge, who edited the Literary Remains , did some very strange things with his uncle's writings, though he was attempting in all sincerity to impose some order on chaos, and to show his uncle to best advantage. Ernest Hartley Coleridge, in editing the series of extracts from the notebooks entitled Anima Poetae , had similar problems to face. Not only was the family still reluctant to reveal the extent of Coleridge's disagreement with his wife and his attachment for Sara Hutchinson (which entailed various excisions), but the compressed form of many of the notes, with their disregard for ordinary rules of syntax, to say nothing of their highly individual punctuation and capitalization, produced numerous additional difficulties. Here are two brief examples of E. H. Coleridge's editorial procedure. In each case the passage is transcribed as accurately as possible from the original, and then followed by the corresponding passage in Anima Poetae . A new year—the old Wants/ The new from God, the old our own/ . . . Time—3 fold—Future slow—Present swift—Past unmoveable—No impatience will quicken the Loiterer—no Terror, no delight rein in the Flyer—No Regret set in motion the Stationary—would'st be happy, take the Delayer for thy counsellor, do not choose the Flyer for thy Friend, nor the ever-remainer for thy Enemy— (Notebook viii, p. 3) The old world begins a new year. That is ours , but this is from God. We may think of time as threefold. Slowly comes the Future, swift the Present passes by, but the Past is unmoveable. No impatience will quicken the loiterer; no terror, no delight rein in the flyer, and no regret set in motion the stationary. Wouldst be happy, take the delayer for thy counsellor; do not choose the flyer for thy friend, nor the ever-remainer for thine enemy. ( Anima Poetae , p. 22) Reviewers resemble often the English Jury and the Italian Conclave, that they are incapable of eating till they have condemned or crowned— Pope like an old Lark who tho' he leaves off soaring &amp; singing in the height, yet has his Spurs grow longer &amp; sharper, the older he grows. (Notebook xvii, p. 167) Reviewers resemble often the English jury and the Italian conclave, they are incapable of eating till they have condemned or craned. The Pope [may be compared to] an old lark, who, though he leaves off soaring and singing in the height, yet has his spurs grow longer and sharper the older he grows. ( Anima Poetae , p. 223) In the first passage I suspect that E. H. Coleridge misread "Wants" as "world," as it is difficult otherwise to account for the rephrasing; in the second he was certainly baffled by "crowned," which he rendered by the unintelligible "craned". But the two notes in the second extract are interesting for another misconception, which would positively have delighted Coleridge, who was always fascinated by the workings of the principle of the association of ideas. In writing the first of the two notes Coleridge's mind went from the notion of juries condemning before eating to the line in The Rape of the Lock , And wretches hang that juryman may dine, and thence to its author, who became the subject of the next note; his grandson's mind, on the other hand, was caught by the phrase "Italian conclave," and he therefore interpreted the succeeding note as referring to the pontiff instead of the poet. E. H. Coleridge was for many years a schoolmaster, and his procedure with the text of the notebooks resembles that of a conscientious instructor correcting a carelessly written schoolboy exercise. He believed, no doubt, that he was only doing what was needful to remove unnecessary stumbling blocks from the path of a reader, and he was preparing a book for the general reader rather than the scholar. But notions of editorial responsibility have changed within the last fifty years, and such manipulation of the text is contrary to modern standards. Editors of comparatively recent material will, no doubt, always have to make excisions out of regard to the susceptibilities of the family and friends of the author, but what they do print will be printed with scrupulous fidelity to the wording of the original, and there will be some statement as to the nature and extent of any necessary omissions. The problem of fidelity to the minuter details of the author's text—to the "accidentals"—is a more difficult one and depends, in the last resort, on the editor's taste and judgment. It is worth bearing in mind, I think, that there is a real gain in consulting, wherever possible, the reader's convenience. Mr. Harold Williams, in his recent edition of Swift's Journal to Stella, reproduces faithfully Swift's "little language" from such of the letters as have survived in manuscript, with the exception that Swift's "th" and "te" become "the," "y" and "yo" becomes "you," and "yr" and "yrs" become "your" and "yours." The consequent gain in legibility is considerable, as may be seen by comparison with the edition which prints these forms as Swift wrote them. As Mr. Williams points out in his preface: In these days, when the art of photography has been enlisted in the student's service, the attempt to reproduce in print insignificant orthographical peculiarities has less meaning than it once had. The result can never be wholly satisfactory, and it may only repel or distract the reader. Again, Professor Vinaver's edition of Malory, the most exciting piece of literary scholarship of the past decade, is not least so because the editor has made Malory so much easier to read in the original text than ever before. Compare any page of this edition with the corresponding passage in Oskar Sommer's and the difference will be apparent at a glance. The paragraphing, the re-punctuation, and the setting of the dialogue in the manner of the modern novel are all introduced without any compromising of editorial integrity, and the gain to the reader who is not primarily a mediaevalist is enormous. A less successful solution of some of these problems is exemplified in the edition recently published of Melville's Billy Budd . Two pages of the original manuscript are reproduced, so that a measure of comparison with the printed text is possible. Melville's spelling, we are told, has been corrected "to modern American usage," and any editorial insertions in the text are enclosed within pointed brackets (instead of the more usual square ones). Thus the editor conceals the fact that Melville used such spellings as "Judgement," "fellow-man," "innocense," and "respectivly" (though the last two may have been mere slips of the pen), but if Melville neglected to close quotations marks or to add a period at the end of a paragraph, the fact is forcibly brought to our notice by means of pointed brackets. It would be of little value, no doubt, to record that the um of "circumstances" is two minims short, but Melville's characteristic spellings are not without interest, while his careless omission of occasional punctuation marks is of far less significance and their silent editorial correction would have been perfectly proper. Further, the textual notes are insufficient to permit an adequate reconstruction of the original. One discovers, after some initial bewilderment, that what are referred to as "variants" are in fact words and phrases that have been deleted and on second thoughts replaced by others; words and phrases said to have been "omitted" are those which in revision were added , very often above a caret mark. Nor is there any attempt in the notes to distinguish the various stages of revision. In the phrase "he could never convert," "could" is above the line in ink over a caret mark, but the fact is not recorded; in the phrase "without first performing," "first" is above the line in ink over a caret mark, and here it is recorded as " om. " In the phrase "that hitherto has stood in human record," Melville first wrote in ink "that stands in human record," then altered it in pencil to "that hitherto has stood in authoritative record," but finally deleted "authoritative" and restored "human." The textual note here merely cites the phrase "that stands in authoritative record" as the "variant" of the final form, thus telescoping two steps in the process of revision into one. Thus an editor, however well intentioned, by departing from established conventions and inadequately describing the state of his original, can confuse more than he aids the reader, and a student wishing to make a close study of Melville's method of composition in this tale is still unable to do so without recourse to the original manuscript. Though it is a function of the editor to aid the reader wherever he can, it is scarcely possible to condone the practice of the editors of The Oxford Book of Seventeenth Century Verse: Where words or lines might seem ugly to modern eyes [they write], or where a difference in usage might lead to ambiguity, we have substituted simpler forms, always taking care (we believe) that the substituted form was actually in use during the seventeenth century . This, though the editors disavow it, is really normalization. One used to get Old English texts normalized to standard West Saxon of about 1000 A.D., and even normalized texts of Chaucer. But happily such a practice is out of favour nowadays, for editors know that not until the eighteenth century was normalization imposed on English orthography, and then by printers rather than authors. 17 There is, however, a real difference between normalization and the expansion of contractions, or the attempt to reproduce in type scribal peculiarities outside the range of the printer's case. The value of the facsimile reprint, in other words, is strictly limited, and photographic aids are diminishing its usefulness. Hence, as a literary student—as distinct from the historian or the palaeographer— I deplore the over-meticulous habit of printing legal records and other old documents with all their contractions, or with the contractions expanded in italics. The silent expansion of contractions is but a courtesy to the reader. Actually, many of these documents ought merely to be described and summarized, with a few of the important phrases quoted; the class of document to which the example belongs may be indicated, if necessary, through reference to historical source books or to formularies. Many of the processes in the preparation of a text, such as transcription, collation, and even proof-correction, involve, it must be admitted, much sheer drudgery, and unlike some other forms of drudgery they cannot be delegated. They are exacting, and they demand the unremitting concentration of a highly trained mind. But the less they show the better; the text's the thing, not the textual notes; and this is perhaps the final principle that an editor would do well to bear in mind. If he has been brought to his task by enthusiasm for an author or a book, he will wish above all things by his work to pass on that enthusiasm. We may fitly conclude with some other words of the classical scholar with whom we began: A man is led by some feeling of kinship for what is greater than himself to devote his life to the interpretation of a poet, philosopher, or historian, to the elucidation of the language itself on its purely linguistic side, or to that of the art or institutions of antiquity. Such a man will freely give himself up to the most arid and laborious investigations. No erasure in a manuscript, no half-read scholium, no fragmentary inscription will seem unworthy of his attention; no grammatical nicety or stylistic peculiarity will be passed by as too trivial for his patient study. All these things will live in his hands; for they are all transformed by his faith in something to which he can hardly give a name, but which, to him, is more real than anything else. 18</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Rationale of Copy-Text * by W. W. GREG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN, IN HIS EDITION OF NASHE, McKERROW invented the term 'copy-text', he was merely giving a name to a conception already familiar, and he used it in a general sense to indicate that early text of a work which an editor selected as the basis of his own. Later, as we shall see, he gave it a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is this change in conception and its implications that I wish to consider. The idea of treating some one text, usually of course a manuscript, as possessing over-riding authority originated among classical scholars, though something similar may no doubt be traced in the work of biblical critics. So long as purely eclectic methods prevailed, any preference for one manuscript over another, if it showed itself, was of course arbitrary; but when, towards the middle of last century, Lachmann and others introduced the genealogical classification of manuscripts as a principle of textual criticism, this appeared to provide at least some scientific basis for the conception of the most authoritative text. The genealogical method was the greatest advance ever made in this field, but its introduction was not unaccompanied by error. For lack of logical analysis, it led, at the hands of its less discriminating exponents, to an attempt to reduce textual criticism to a code of mechanical rules. There was just this much excuse, that the method did make it possible to sweep away mechanically a great deal of rubbish. What its more hasty devotees failed to understand, or at any rate sufficiently to bear in mind, was that authority is never absolute, but only relative. Thus a school arose, mainly in Germany, that taught that if a manuscript could be shown to be generally more correct than any other and to have descended from the archetype independently of other lines of transmission, it was 'scientific' to follow its readings whenever they were not manifestly impossible. It was this fallacy that Housman exposed with devastating sarcasm. He had only to point out that 'Chance and the common course of nature will not bring it to pass that the readings of a ms are right wherever they are possible and impossible wherever they are wrong'. 1 That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption of the school in question, 2 and it is one that naturally commends itself to those who believe themselves capable of distinguishing between sense and nonsense, but who know themselves incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong. Unfortunately the attractions of a mechanical method misled many who were capable of better things. There is one important respect in which the editing of classical texts differs from that of English. In the former it is the common practice, for fairly obvious reasons, to normalize the spelling, so that (apart from emendation) the function of an editor is limited to choosing between those manuscript readings that offer significant variants. In English it is now usual to preserve the spelling of the earliest or it may be some other selected text. Thus it will be seen that the conception of 'copy-text' does not present itself to the classical and to the English editor in quite the same way; indeed, if I am right in the view I am about to put forward, the classical theory of the 'best' or 'most authoritative' manuscript, whether it be held in a reasonable or in an obviously fallacious form, has really nothing to do with the English theory of 'copy-text' at all. I do not wish to argue the case of 'old spelling' versus 'modern spelling'; I accept the view now prevalent among English scholars. But I cannot avoid some reference to the ground on which present practice is based, since it is intimately connected with my own views on copy-text. The former practice of modernizing the spelling of English works is no longer popular with editors, since spelling is now recognized as an essential characteristic of an author, or at least of his time and locality. So far as my knowledge goes, the alternative of normalization has not been seriously explored, but its philological difficulties are clearly considerable. 3 Whether, with the advance of linguistic science, it will some day be possible to establish a standard spelling for a particular period or district or author, or whether the historical circumstances in which our language has developed must always forbid any attempt of the sort (at any rate before comparatively recent times) I am not competent to say; but I agree with what appears to be the general opinion that such an attempt would at present only result in confusion and misrepresentation. It is therefore the modern editorial practice to choose whatever extant text may be supposed to represent most nearly what the author wrote and to follow it with the least possible alteration. But here we need to draw a distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them 'substantive', readings of the text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression, and others, such in general as spelling, punctuation, word-division, and the like, affecting mainly its formal presentation, which may be regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call them 'accidentals', of the text. 4 The distinction is not arbitrary or theoretical, but has an immediate bearing on textual criticism, for scribes (or compositors) may in general be expected to react, and experience shows that they generally do react, differently to the two categories. As regards substantive readings their aim may be assumed to be to reproduce exactly those of their copy, though they will doubtless sometimes depart from them accidentally and may even, for one reason or another, do so intentionally: as regards accidentals they will normally follow their own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons and to varying degrees, be influenced by their copy. Thus a contemporary manuscript will at least preserve the spelling of the period, and may even retain some of the author's own, while it may at the same time depart frequently from the wording of the original: on the other hand a later transcript of the same original may reproduce the wording with essential accuracy while completely modernizing the spelling. Since, then, it is only on grounds of expediency, and in consequence either of philological ignorance or of linguistic circumstances, that we select a particular original as our copy-text, I suggest that it is only in the matter of accidentals that we are bound (within reason) to follow it, and that in respect of substantive readings we have exactly the same liberty (and obligation) of choice as has a classical editor, or as we should have were it a modernized text that we were preparing. 5 But the distinction has not been generally recognized, and has never, so far as I am aware, been explicitly drawn. 6 This is not surprising. The battle between 'old spelling' and 'modern spelling' was fought out over works written for the most part between 1550 and 1650, and for which the original authorities are therefore as a rule printed editions. Now printed editions usually form an ancestral series, in which each is derived from its immediate predecessor; whereas the extant manuscripts of any work have usually only a collateral relationship, each being derived from the original independently, or more or less independently, of the others. Thus in the case of printed books, and in the absence of revision in a later edition, it is normally the first edition alone that can claim authority, and this authority naturally extends to substantive readings and accidentals alike. There was, therefore, little to force the distinction upon the notice of editors of works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and it apparently never occurred to them that some fundamental difference of editorial method might be called for in the rare cases in which a later edition had been revised by the author or in which there existed more than one 'substantive' edition of comparable authority. 7 Had they been more familiar with works transmitted in manuscript, they might possibly have reconsidered their methods and been led to draw the distinction I am suggesting. For although the underlying principles of textual criticism are, of course, the same in the case of works transmitted in manuscripts and in print, particular circumstances differ, and certain aspects of the common principles may emerge more clearly in the one case than in the other. However, since the idea of copy-text originated and has generally been applied in connexion with the editing of printed books, it is such that I shall mainly consider, and in what follows reference may be understood as confined to them unless manuscripts are specifically mentioned. The distinction I am proposing between substantive readings and accidentals, or at any rate its relevance to the question of copy-text, was clearly not present to McKerrow's mind when in 1904 he published the second volume of his edition of the Works of Thomas Nashe, which included The Unfortunate Traveller . Collation of the early editions of this romance led him to the conclusion that the second, advertised on the title as 'Newly corrected and augmented', had in fact been revised by the author, but at the same time that not all the alterations could with certainty be ascribed to him. 8 He nevertheless proceeded to enunciate the rule that 'if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, or some of them at least , are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint'. 9 The italics are mine. 10 This is applying with a vengeance the principle that I once approvingly described as 'maintaining the integrity of the copy-text'. But it must be pointed out that there are in fact two quite distinct principles involved. One, put in more general form, is that if, for whatever reason, a particular authority be on the whole preferred, an editor is bound to accept all its substantive readings (if not manifestly impossible). This is the old fallacy of the 'best text', and may be taken to be now generally rejected. The other principle, also put in general form, is that whatever particular authority be preferred, whether as being revised or as generally preserving the substantive readings more faithfully than any other, it must be taken as copy-text, that is to say that it must also be followed in the matter of accidentals. This is the principle that interests us at the moment, and it is one that McKerrow himself came, at least partly, to question. In 1939 McKerrow published his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare , and he would not have been the critic he was if his views had not undergone some changes in the course of thirty-five years. One was in respect of revision. He had come to the opinion that to take a reprint, even a revised reprint, as copy-text was indefensible. Whatever may be the relation of a particular substantive edition to the author's manuscript (provided that there is any transcriptional link at all) it stands to reason that the relation of a reprint of that edition must be more remote. If then, putting aside all question of revision, a particular substantive edition has an over-riding claim to be taken as copy-text, to displace it in favour of a reprint, whether revised or not, means receding at least one step further from the author's original in so far as the general form of the text is concerned. 11 Some such considerations must have been in McKerrow's mind when he wrote ( Prolegomena , pp. 17-18): 'Even if, however, we were to assure ourselves . . . that certain corrections found in a later edition of a play were of Shakespearian authority, it would not by any means follow that that edition should be used as the copy-text of a reprint. 12 It would undoubtedly be necessary to incorporate these corrections in our text, but . . . it seems evident that . . . this later edition will (except for the corrections) deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript. . . . [Thus] the nearest approach to our ideal . . . will be produced by using the earliest "good" print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author.' This is a clear statement of the position, and in it he draws exactly the distinction between substantive readings (in the form of corrections) and accidentals (or general texture) on which I am insisting. He then, however, relapsed into heresy in the matter of the substantive readings. Having spoken, as above, of the need to introduce 'such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author', he seems to have feared conceding too much to eclecticism, and he proceeded: 'We are not to regard the "goodness" of a reading in and by itself, or to consider whether it appeals to our aesthetic sensibilities or not; we are to consider whether a particular edition taken as a whole contains variants from the edition from which it was otherwise printed which could not reasonably be attributed to an ordinary press-corrector, but by reason of their style, point, and what we may call inner harmony with the spirit of the play as a whole, seem likely to be the work of the author: and once having decided this to our satisfaction we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints.' We can see clearly enough what he had in mind, namely that the evidence of correction (under which head he presumably intended to include revision) must be considered as a whole ; but he failed to add the equally important proviso that the alterations must also be of a piece (and not, as in The Unfortunate Traveller , of apparently disparate origin) before we can be called upon to accept them all . As he states it his canon is open to exactly the same objections as the 'most authoritative manuscript' theory in classical editing. McKerrow was, therefore, in his later work quite conscious of the distinction between substantive readings and accidentals, in so far as the problem of revision is concerned. But he never applied the conception to cases in which we have more than one substantive text, as in Hamlet and perhaps in 2 Henry IV, Troilus and Cressida , and Othello . Presumably he would have argued that since faithfulness to the wording of the author was one of the criteria he laid down for determining the choice of the copy-text, it was an editor's duty to follow its substantive readings with a minimum of interference. We may assume that neither McKerrow nor other editors of the conservative school imagined that such a procedure would always result in establishing the authentic text of the original; what they believed was that from it less harm would result than from opening the door to individual choice among variants, since it substituted an objective for a subjective method of determination. This is, I think, open to question. It is impossible to exclude individual judgement from editorial procedure: it operates of necessity in the all-important matter of the choice of copy-text and in the minor one of deciding what readings are possible and what not; why, therefore, should the choice between possible readings be withdrawn from its competence? Uniformity of result at the hands of different editors is worth little if it means only uniformity in error; and it may not be too optimistic a belief that the judgement of an editor, fallible as it must necessarily be, is likely to bring us closer to what the author wrote than the enforcement of an arbitrary rule. The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text. Thus it may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of variation. The failure to make this distinction and to apply this principle has naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an edition, and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past generation. I will give a couple of examples of the sort of thing I mean that I have lately come across in the course of my own work. They are all the more suitable as illustrations since they occur in texts edited by scholars of recognized authority, neither of whom is particularly subject to the tyranny in question. One is from the edition of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus by Professor F. S. Boas (1932). The editor, rightly I think, took the so-called B-text (1616) as the basis of his own, correcting it where necessary by comparison with the A-text (1604). 13 Now a famous line in Faustus's opening soliloquy runs in 1604, Bid Oncaymœon farewell, Galen come and in 1616, Bid Oeconomy farewell; and Galen come . . . Here Oncaymœon is now recognized as standing for on cay mœ on or ?ν Κα? μ? ?ν: but this was not understood at the time, and Oeconomy was substituted in reprints of the A-text in 1609 and 1611, and thence taken over by the B-text. The change, however, produced a rather awkward line, and in 1616 the and was introduced as a metrical accommodation. In the first half of the line Boas rightly restored the reading implied in A; but in the second half he retained, out of deference to his copy-text, the and whose only object was to accommodate the reading he had rejected in the first. One could hardly find a better example of the contradictions to which a mechanical following of the copy-text may lead. 14 My other instance is from The Gipsies Metamorphosed as edited by Dr. Percy Simpson among the masques of Ben Jonson in 1941. He took as his copy-text the Huntington manuscript, and I entirely agree with his choice. In this, and in Simpson's edition, a line of the ribald Cock Lorel ballad runs (sir-reverence!), All w ch he blewe away with a fart whereas for blewe other authorities have flirted . Now, the meaning of flirted is not immediately apparent, for no appropriate sense of the word is recorded. There is, however, a rare use of the substantive flirt for a sudden gust of wind, and it is impossible to doubt that this is what Jonson had in mind, for no scribe or compositor could have invented the reading flirted . It follows that in the manuscript blewe is nothing but the conjecture of a scribe who did not understand his original: only the mesmeric influence of the copy-text could obscure so obvious a fact. 15 I give these examples merely to illustrate the kind of error that, in modern editions of English works, often results from undue deference to the copy-text. This reliance on one particular authority results from the desire for an objective theory of text-construction and a distrust, often no doubt justified, of the operation of individual judgement. The attitude may be explained historically as a natural and largely salutary reaction against the methods of earlier editors. Dissatisfied with the results of eclectic freedom and reliance on personal taste, critics sought to establish some sort of mechanical apparatus for dealing with textual problems that should lead to uniform results independent of the operator. Their efforts were not altogether unattended by success. One result was the recognition of the general worthlessness of reprints. And even in the more difficult field of manuscript transmission it is true that formal rules will carry us part of the way: they can at least effect a preliminary clearing of the ground. This I sought to show in my essay on The Calculus of Variants (1927); but in the course of investigation it became clear that there is a definite limit to the field over which formal rules are applicable. Between readings of equal extrinsic authority no rules of the sort can decide, since by their very nature it is only to extrinsic relations that they are relevant. The choice is necessarily a matter for editorial judgement, and an editor who declines or is unable to exercise his judgement and falls back on some arbitrary canon, such as the authority of the copy-text, is in fact abdicating his editorial function. Yet this is what has been frequently commended as 'scientific'—'streng wissenschaftlich' in the prevalent idiom—and the result is that what many editors have done is to produce, not editions of their authors' works at all, but only editions of particular authorities for those works, a course that may be perfectly legitimate in itself, but was not the one they were professedly pursuing. This by way, more or less, of digression. At the risk of repetition I should like to recapitulate my view of the position of copy-text in editorial procedure. The thesis I am arguing is that the historical circumstances of the English language make it necessary to adopt in formal matters the guidance of some particular early text. If the several extant texts of a work form an ancestral series, the earliest will naturally be selected, and since this will not only come nearest to the author's original in accidentals, but also (revision apart) most faithfully preserve the correct readings where substantive variants are in question, everything is straightforward, and the conservative treatment of the copy-text is justified. But whenever there is more than one substantive text of comparable authority, 16 then although it will still be necessary to choose one of them as copy-text, and to follow it in accidentals, this copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings are concerned. The choice between these, in cases of variation, will be determined partly by the opinion the editor may form respecting the nature of the copy from which each substantive edition was printed, which is a matter of external authority; partly by the intrinsic authority of the several texts as judged by the relative frequency of manifest errors therein; and partly by the editor's judgement of the intrinsic claims of individual readings to originality—in other words their intrinsic merit, so long as by 'merit' we mean the likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than their appeal to the individual taste of the editor. Such, as I see it, is the general theory of copy-text. But there remain a number of subsidiary questions that it may be worth-while to discuss. One is the degree of faithfulness with which the copy-text should be reproduced. Since the adoption of a copy-text is a matter of convenience rather than of principle—being imposed on us either by linguistic circumstances or our own philological ignorance—it follows that there is no reason for treating it as sacrosanct, even apart from the question of substantive variation. Every editor aiming at a critical edition will, of course, correct scribal or typographical errors. He will also correct readings in accordance with any errata included in the edition taken as copy-text. I see no reason why he should not alter misleading or eccentric spellings which he is satisfied emanate from the scribe or compositor and not from the author. If the punctuation is persistently erroneous or defective an editor may prefer to discard it altogether to make way for one of his own. He is, I think, at liberty to do so, provided that he gives due weight to the original in deciding on his own, and that he records the alteration whenever the sense is appreciably affected. Much the same applies to the use of capitals and italics. I should favour expanding contractions (except perhaps when dealing with an author's holograph) so long as ambiguities and abnormalities are recorded. A critical edition does not seem to me a suitable place in which to record the graphic peculiarities of particular texts, 17 and in this respect the copy-text is only one among others. These, however, are all matters within the discretion of an editor: I am only concerned to uphold his liberty of judgement. Some minor points arise when it becomes necessary to replace a reading of the copy-text by one derived from another source. It need not, I think, be copied in the exact form in which it there appears. Suppose that the copy-text follows the earlier convention in the use of u and v , and the source from which the reading is taken follows the later. Naturally in transferring the reading from the latter to the former it would be made to conform to the earlier convention. I would go further. Suppose that the copy-text reads 'hazard', but that we have reason to believe that the correct reading is 'venture': suppose further that whenever this word occurs in the copy-text it is in the form 'venter': then 'venter', I maintain, is the form we should adopt. In like manner editorial emendations should be made to conform to the habitual spelling of the copy-text. In the case of rival substantive editions the choice between substantive variants is, I have explained, generally independent of the copy-text. Perhaps one concession should be made. Suppose that the claims of two readings, one in the copy-text and one in some other authority, appear to be exactly balanced: what then should an editor do? In such a case, while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand. 18 Much more important, and difficult, are the problems that arise in connexion with revision. McKerrow seems only to mention correction, but I think he must have intended to include revision, so long as this falls short of complete rewriting: in any case the principle is the same. I have already considered the practice he advocated (pp. 23-25)—namely that an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and introduce into it all the substantive variants of the revised reprint, other than manifest errors—and have explained that I regard it as too sweeping and mechanical. The emendation that I proposed (p. 26) is, I think, theoretically sufficient, but from a practical point of view it lacks precision. In a case of revision or correction the normal procedure would be for the author to send the printer either a list of the alterations to be made or else a corrected copy of an earlier edition. In setting up the new edition we may suppose that the printer would incorporate the alterations thus indicated by the author; but it must be assumed that he would also introduce a normal amount of unauthorized variation of his own. 19 The problem that faces the editor is to distinguish between the two categories. I suggest the following frankly subjective procedure. Granting that the fact of revision (or correction) is established, an editor should in every case of variation ask himself (1) whether the original reading is one that can reasonably be attributed to the author, and (2) whether the later reading is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former. If the answer to the first question is negative, then the later reading should be accepted as at least possibly an authoritative correction (unless, of course, it is itself incredible). If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to (2) is negative, the original reading should be retained. If the answers to both questions are affirmative, then the later reading should be presumed to be due to revision and admitted into the text, whether the editor himself considers it an improvement or not. It will be observed that one implication of this procedure is that a later variant that is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the text—to the scandal of faithful followers of McKerrow. I do not, of course, pretend that my procedure will lead to consistently correct results, but I think that the results, if less uniform, will be on the whole preferable to those achieved through following any mechanical rule. I am, no doubt, presupposing an editor of reasonable competence; but if an editor is really incompetent, I doubt whether it much matters what procedure he adopts: he may indeed do less harm with some than with others, he will do little good with any. And in any case, I consider that it would be disastrous to curb the liberty of competent editors in the hope of preventing fools from behaving after their kind. I will give one illustration of the procedure in operation, taken again from Jonson's Masque of Gipsies , a work that is known to have been extensively revised for a later performance. At one point the text of the original version runs as follows, a wise Gypsie . . . is as politicke a piece of Flesh, as most Iustices in the County where he maunds whereas the texts of the revised version replace maunds by stalkes . Now, maund is a recognized canting term meaning to beg, and there is not the least doubt that it is what Jonson originally wrote. Further, it might well be argued that it is less likely that he should have displaced it in revision by a comparatively commonplace alternative, than that a scribe should have altered a rather unusual word that he failed to understand—just as we know that, in a line already quoted (p. 27), a scribe altered flirted to blewe . I should myself incline to this view were it not that at another point Jonson in revision added the lines, And then ye may stalke The Gypsies walke where stalk , in the sense of going stealthily, is used almost as a technical term. In view of this I do not think it unreasonable to suppose that Jonson himself substituted stalkes for maunds from a desire to avoid the implication that his aristocratic Gipsies were beggars, and I conclude that it must be allowed to pass as (at least possibly) a correction, though no reasonable critic would prefer it to the original. With McKerrow's view that in all normal cases of correction or revision the original edition should still be taken as the copy-text, I am in complete agreement. But not all cases are normal, as McKerrow himself recognized. While advocating, in the passage already quoted (p. 25), that the earliest 'good' edition should be taken as copy-text and corrections incorporated in it, he added the proviso, 'unless we could show that the [revised] edition in question (or the copy from which it had been printed) had been gone over and corrected throughout by' the author (my italics). This proviso is not in fact very explicit, but it clearly assumes that there are (or at least may be) cases in which an editor would be justified in taking a revised reprint as his copy-text, and it may be worth inquiring what these supposed cases are. If a work has been entirely rewritten, and is printed from a new manuscript, the question does not arise, since the revised edition will be a substantive one, and as such will presumably be chosen by the editor as his copy-text. But short of this, an author, wishing to make corrections or alterations in his work, may not merely hand the printer a revised copy of an earlier edition, but himself supervise the printing of the new edition and correct the proofs as the sheets go through the press. In such a case it may be argued that even though the earlier edition, if printed from his own manuscript, will preserve the author's individual peculiarities more faithfully than the revised reprint, he must nevertheless be assumed to have taken responsibility for the latter in respect of accidentals no less than substantive readings, and that it is therefore the revised reprint that should be taken as copy-text. The classical example is afforded by the plays in the 1616 folio of Ben Jonson's Works. In this it appears that even the largely recast Every Man in his Humour was not set up from an independent manuscript but from a much corrected copy of the quarto of 1601. That Jonson revised the proofs of the folio has indeed been disputed, but Simpson is most likely correct in supposing that he did so, and he was almost certainly responsible for the numerous corrections made while the sheets were in process of printing. Simpson's consequent decision to take the folio for his copy-text for the plays it contains will doubtless be approved by most critics. I at least have no wish to dispute his choice. 20 Only I would point out—and here I think Dr. Simpson would agree with me—that even in this case the procedure involves some sacrifice of individuality. For example, I notice that in the text of Sejanus as printed by him there are twenty-eight instances of the Jonsonian 'Apostrophus' (an apostrophe indicating the elision of a vowel that is nevertheless retained in printing) but of these only half actually appear in the folio, the rest he has introduced from the quarto. This amounts to an admission that in some respects at least the quarto preserves the formal aspect of the author's original more faithfully than the folio. The fact is that cases of revision differ so greatly in circumstances and character that it seems impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint. All that can be said is that if the original be selected, then the author's corrections must be incorporated; and that if the reprint be selected, then the original reading must be restored when that of the reprint is due to unauthorized variation. Thus the editor cannot escape the responsibility of distinguishing to the best of his ability between the two categories. No juggling with copy-text will relieve him of the duty and necessity of exercizing his own judgement. In conclusion I should like to examine this problem of revision and copy-text a little closer. In the case of a work like Sejanus , in which correction or revision has been slight, it would obviously be possible to take the quarto as the copy-text and introduce into it whatever authoritative alterations the folio may supply; and indeed, were one editing the play independently, this would be the natural course to pursue. But a text like that of Every Man in his Humour presents an entirely different problem. In the folio revision and reproduction are so blended that it would seem impossible to disentangle intentional from what may be fortuitous variation, and injudicious to make the attempt. An editor of the revised version has no choice but to take the folio as his copy-text. It would appear therefore that a reprint may in practice be forced upon an editor as copy-text by the nature of the revision itself, quite apart from the question whether or not the author exercized any supervision over its printing. This has a bearing upon another class of texts, in which a reprint was revised, not by the author, but through comparison with some more authoritative manuscript. Instances are Shakespeare's Richard III and King Lear . Of both much the best text is supplied by the folio of 1623; but this is not a substantive text, but one set up from a copy of an earlier quarto that had been extensively corrected by collation with a manuscript preserved in the playhouse. So great and so detailed appears to have been the revision that it would be an almost impossible task to distinguish between variation due to the corrector and that due to the compositor, 21 and an editor has no choice but to take the folio as copy-text. Indeed, this would in any case be incumbent upon him for a different reason; for the folio texts are in some parts connected by transcriptional continuity with the author's manuscript, whereas the quartos contain only reported texts, whose accidental characteristics can be of no authority whatever. At the same time, analogy with Every Man in his Humour suggests that even had the quartos of Richard III and King Lear possessed higher authority than in fact they do, the choice of copy-text must yet have been the same. I began this discussion in the hope of clearing my own mind as well as others' on a rather obscure though not unimportant matter of editorial practice. I have done something to sort out my own ideas: others must judge for themselves. If they disagree, it is up to them to maintain some different point of view. My desire is rather to provoke discussion than to lay down the law. * Read before the English Institute on September 8, 1949, by Dr. J. M. Osborn for W. W. Greg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Introduction to Manilius, 1903, p. xxxii. 2 The more naive the scribe, the more often will the assumption prove correct; the more sophisticated, the less often. This, no doubt, is why critics of this school tend to reject 'the more correct but the less sincere' manuscript in favour of 'the more corrupt but the less interpolated', as Housman elsewhere observes ('The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism', Proceedings of the Classical Association , 1921, xviii. 75). Still, any reasonable critic will prefer the work of a naive to that of a sophisticated scribe, though he may not regard it as necessarily 'better'. 3 I believe that an attempt has been made in the case of certain Old and Middle English texts, but how consistently and with what success I cannot judge. In any case I am here concerned chiefly with works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 4 It will, no doubt, be objected that punctuation may very seriously 'affect' an author's meaning; still it remains properly a matter of presentation, as spelling does in spite of its use in distinguishing homonyms. The distinction I am trying to draw is practical, not philosophic. It is also true that between substantive readings and spellings there is an intermediate class of word-forms about the assignment of which opinions may differ and which may have to be treated differently in dealing with the work of different scribes. 5 For the sake of clearness in making the distinction I have above stressed the independence of scribes and compositors in the matter of accidentals: at the same time, when he selects his copy-text, an editor will naturally hope that it retains at least something of the character of the original. Experience, however, shows that while the distribution of substantive variants generally agrees with the genetic relation of the texts, that of accidental variants is comparatively arbitrary. 6 Some discussion bearing on it will be found in the Prolegomena to my lectures on The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942), 'Note on Accidental Characteristics of the Text' (pp. l-lv), particularly the paragraph on pp. liii-liv, and note 1. But at the time of writing I was still a long way from any consistent theory regarding copy-text. 7 A 'substantive' edition is McKerrow's term for an edition that is not a reprint of any other. I shall use the term in this sense, since I do not think that there should be any danger of confusion between 'substantive editions' and 'substantive readings'. I have above ignored the practice of some eccentric editors who took as copy-text for a work the latest edition printed in the author's lifetime, on the assumption, presumably, that he revised each edition as it appeared. The textual results were naturally deplorable. 8 He believed, or at least strongly suspected, that some were due to the printer's desire to save space, and that others were 'the work of some person who had not thoroughly considered the sense of the passage which he was altering' (ii.195). 9 Nashe, ii.197. The word 'reprint' really begs the question. If all an 'editor' aims at is an exact reprint, then obviously he will choose one early edition, on whatever grounds he considers relevant, and reproduce it as it stands. But McKerrow does emend his copy-text where necessary. It is symptomatic that he did not distinguish between a critical edition and a reprint. 10 Without the italicized phrase the statement would appear much more plausible (though I should still regard it as fallacious, and so would McKerrow himself have done later on) but it would not justify the procedure adopted. 11 This may, at any rate, be put forward as a general proposition, leaving possible exceptions to be considered later (pp. 33 ff.). 12 Again he speaks of a 'reprint' where he evidently had in mind a critical edition on conservative lines. 13 Boas's text is in fact modernized, so that my theory of copy-text does not strictly apply, but since he definitely accepts the B-text as his authority, the principle is the same. 14 Or consider the following readings: 1604, 1609 'Consissylogismes', 1611 'subtile sylogismes', 1616 'subtle Sillogismes'. Here 'subtile', an irresponsible guess by the printer of 1611 for a word he did not understand, was taken over in 1616. The correct reading is, of course, 'concise syllogisms'. Boas's refusal to take account of the copy used in 1616 led him here and elsewhere to perpetuate some of its manifest errors. In this particular instance he appears to have been unaware of the reading of 1611. 15 At another point two lines appear in an unnatural order in the manuscript. The genetic relation of the texts proves the inversion to be an error. But of this relation Simpson seems to have been ignorant. He was again content to rely on the copy-text. 16 The proviso is inserted to meet the case of the so-called 'bad quartos' of Shakespearian and other Elizabethan plays and of the whole class of 'reported' texts, whose testimony can in general be neglected. 17 That is, certainly not in the text, and probably not in the general apparatus: they may appropriately form the subject of an appendix. 18 This is the course I recommended in the Prolegomena to The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (p. xxix), adding that it 'at least saves the trouble of tossing a coin'. What I actually wrote in 1942 was that in such circumstances an editor 'will naturally retain the reading of the copy-text, this being the text which he has already decided is prima facie the more correct'. This implies that correctness in respect of substantive readings is one of the criteria in the choice of the copy-text; and indeed I followed McKerrow in laying it down that an editor should select as copy-text the one that 'appears likely to have departed least in wording, spelling, and punctuation from the author's manuscript'. There is a good deal in my Prolegomena that I should now express differently, and on this particular point I have definitely changed my opinion. I should now say that the choice of the copy-text depends solely on its formal features (accidentals) and that fidelity as regards substantive readings is irrelevant—though fortunately in nine cases out of ten the choice will be the same whichever rule we adopt. 19 I mean substantive variation, such as occurs in all but the most faithful reprints. 20 Simpson's procedure in taking the 1616 folio as copy-text in the case of most of the masques included, although he admits that in their case Jonson cannot be supposed to have supervised the printing, is much more questionable. 21 Some variation is certainly due to error on the part of the folio printer, and this it is of course the business of an editor to detect and correct so far as he is able.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems * by FREDSON BOWERS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH EDITORIAL problems not as a usurper of the functions of legitimate criticism, but instead as the necessary foundation on which, in certain investigations, textual criticism must be based and to which criticism must constantly refer for more or less definitive judgments. Bibliography, in W. W. Greg's acute phrase, is the grammar of literary investigation. This position was strikingly advanced in Greg's classic address on the relations of bibliography to literature which appeared some time ago in Neophilologus , and, again, in his "Bibliography—An Apologia" ( The Library , 4th ser. XIII [1932], 113 ff.). Any attempt merely to restate Greg's views here would be quite superfluous. For some years, at least among scholars, the inferential identification of bibliography with textual criticism has been so firmly established that to talk about the contribution of one to the other might appear to be like a solemn discussion of the usefulness of the arm to the hand. Nevertheless, it is possible to suspect that, as more and more scholars have come to deal with these twin methods, the popularizing of their disciplines may have led, by subtle degrees, to a rather over-simplified view of the basic provinces of bibliography and textual criticism, especially as applied to editorial problems. Certainly the theory that every bibliographer is professionally qualified to be a full-fledged textual critic and editor is quite wrong. Correspondingly, there are a number of distinguished textual critics whom, according to any strict accounting, we might hesitate to call bibliographers. Some fortunate scholars like Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Percy Simpson may happily combine in themselves both functions, although perhaps in unequal proportions; but this two souls in body one is certainly the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, the most prominent Elizabethan textual critic now living—I refer to Mr. Dover Wilson—often operates in that dark region of the ur-state of a text which McKerrow rightly hesitated to identify with bibliography. One should comment, however, that not all of Wilson's readers—or his critics—are completely aware of the distinction. It is somewhat perturbing, for example, in Hereward Price's admirable "Towards a Scientific Method of Textual Criticism in the Elizabethan Drama" 1 to find his chief whipping boy, Dover Wilson, consistently referred to as representing the bibliographical school. Save for his impatience at various of Wilson's well-known aberrations, Mr. Price—no more than the rest of us—would, I should think, completely discount such investigations. But we may agree with McKerrow and Greg that this scholarship is not usually bibliographical in any sense in which we should be prepared to use the term. Bibliography is likely to be a vague and misused word because it has come to be employed for too many different purposes. For the present discussion we may rule out enumerative bibliography—the making-up of finding or reference lists of books on various subjects—and use the term to mean analytical bibliography, the investigation and explanation of a book as a material object. Yet even within this narrower limitation there are various strata and subdivisions of research. For example, we have such forms of bibliographical spadework as the identification and recording of type-faces as by Haebler, or of STC printers' ornaments as is now in progress by F. S. Ferguson, with their dates and history. But when we move from such essential preliminary investigation, and from the recording of material data as a part of publishing history, to another sort of bibliography, more specifically of the kind we designate as analytical , we come to a field in which all our accumulated knowledge of printing practice and history is devoted to the examination of individual or related books as material objects, with a view to determining the facts of their production. Is there or is there not a cancel in a certain gathering; were the various sheets of a book printed seriatim or simultaneously in two or more sections; did one or two compositors, one or more presses, work on this book, and if so which parts did they do; was a cancel title-page or a cancel in the text printed later or as a part of the continuous printing of the book. Are variants in the sheets of the book the result of different impressions, or do they result from different typesettings or from simple correction at the press. If some of the sheets are of a single impression but certain others exhibit variant typesettings, which setting is the original, and why was the resetting made. If there are variant imprints, which was first through the press. And so on. It will be seen that correct answers to some of these questions depend not only on the simple discovery of the facts themselves, but more particularly on the satisfactory explanation of the ascertained facts. From specific analyses of this kind, some speculatively minded bibliographers may endeavor to evolve new techniques for bringing to light yet further secrets in printed books, techniques which may enable us to attack successfully some general problems which have heretofore been thought insoluble. Such technical examinations of individual books for their own sake are proceeding very swiftly these days, and they are being matched step by step by the parallel development of techniques for determining with greater precision the relation of the printed book to its underlying manuscript. 2 No textual critic can afford to ignore the results of these investigations. From Willoughby's and Hinman's explorations of spelling tests, 3 assisted in certain cases by evidence from the varying length of the compositor's stick, 4 we are now able to distinguish with some certainty in the STC period and the following years the precise pages of a book set by different compositors. By an equation of these compositors' habits we can thereupon make certain assumptions about the characteristics of the manuscript from which they were setting. The cooperative efforts which have been made in the analysis of the evidence of headlines 5 have opened up possibilities, in combination with this compositor evidence, for determining sometimes quite minute but necessary questions of the presswork and proofreading. To these may be added—among many other investigations—the classic Carter and Pollard examination of paper and type which exposed the Wise forgeries, Hazen's use of identified paper to detect Strawberry Hill forgeries, and Stevenson's technique for aligning watermarks with presswork. 6 The unexpected uses of bibliography have been demonstrated in Bond's assignment of authorship to certain doubtful Spectator papers, the whole argument resting ultimately on type left standing in advertisements and headings. 7 Astonishing results have recently accrued from certain research on eighteenth-century press figures, which had been earlier dismissed by McKerrow as of little bibliographical significance. Knotts 8 has added a chapter to the work of Sale, Chapman, and others; and W. B. Todd's latest interpretation of the evidence of these figures in a number of books demonstrates some most exciting things one can learn of printing. 9 From this evidence a whole new area of research has been opened up of such importance for distinguishing impressions, partial re-impressions, and editions, as well as various other important textual matters, that we may well believe in many cases press figures alone will come to be the most valuable tool for penetrating the extreme difficulties of textual problems in frequently reprinted popular eighteenth-century authors. I should be less than candid if I tried to pretend that the immediate or even the chief aim of these and of many other bibliographical scholars was to serve as the sons of Martha to textual criticism. Without question, a number of bibliographical investigations which eventually proved invaluable to textual criticism were not undertaken with this end immediately in view and almost by accident arrived at their textual applications. Thus a real difference from textual criticism must always be felt, I suspect, in bibliographical research in its purest aspect. To defend themselves against doubters, bibliographers are accustomed to argue that the ultimate aim of all bibliographical research, and therefore its justification, is the definitive account of books in a descriptive bibliography, or the direct application of their findings to textual criticism. But I make bold to say that—at least as I view it—the immediate end of a great deal of research is no such thing. Although I believe that the conventional justification is valid for the ultimate aims, and that this rationale is deeply felt by almost every bibliographical student, nevertheless, even though eventual application is the ideal, ordinarily textual criticism has not provided the immediate spur to the investigation and no specific textual use is often anticipated, at least in the early stages of the work. This attitude develops, in part, because many technical studies that are absolutely necessary yet require no interest in textual criticism on the part of the investigator. In part, because various of these studies are concerned only with a fragment of some total problem, the whole of which must be unraveled before any of it can be made of practical use to textual criticism. Nonetheless, in spite of the various legitimate reasons which may be advanced to explain the rationale for much technical work in bibliography, the point of view does in fact serve to separate many bibliographers from textual critics; indeed, it would be tempting to say most bibliographers were it not an increasing tendency for a number of analysts, with or without due training, to cross over the line and to concern themselves directly with the editing of texts. Others, though not editors, may develop so great an interest in textual questions that they direct their research specifically towards bibliographical problems which do have an immediate textual application and thus underlie accurate criticism. The record, while respectable, has not been one of unalloyed success, perhaps, and when bibliographers have concerned themselves with matters of textual criticism that were not primarily bibliographical, they have sometimes floundered pitifully if they lacked the training and the qualities of mind which are necessary for textual criticism in its purest state. I use this statement of a point too often overlooked, in our current tendency to exalt the bibliographer, as an aid towards a cursory glance at the nature of textual criticism, a subject on which I can speak with little authority and on which I shall anticipate correction. It is perhaps absurd to set up too sharp a distinction between textual critics and textual bibliographers. Anyone, we may suppose, who is concerned with the origin, derivation, authority, and correctness of a text, in whole or in part, is a textual critic, no matter what his method of approach. Some scholars tackle problems through bibliography, some through what Greg has called metacriticism, some through an attempted or actual combination of bibliography and criticism. For purposes of distinction I must deal in blacks and whites more starkly than is perhaps realistic. Nevertheless, I am sure that when we distinguish between a McKerrow and a Dover Wilson, both brilliant examples of different schools, we are in fact implying a greater fundamental difference than exists between the conservative and speculative wings of the same method. Greg—and in this he is frequently misunderstood—insists that the bibliographer must view a book only as a material object. 10 This is a far cry from the aims of a textual critic. Historically, textual criticism developed long before analytical bibliography; and it evolved its own rules, especially for dealing with manuscripts, both classical and vernacular, according to certain principles which are outside the strictly bibliographical range, if for our purposes we continue to limit the definition of bibliography to analytical bibliography. These principles, or something like them, were also applied to printed books, again before bibliography was more than a gleam in the eye, and—as Greg has shown in his paper for this series—they are still in part applicable to certain problems. Thus there has been established in the past a firm tradition for dealing with texts; and it would be foolish for us to believe that analytical bibliography has displaced this tradition, or even that in many cases it could. Nevertheless, analytical bibliography has demonstrated that in some circumstances the classical tradition is not completely self-sufficient. We may put it, therefore, that bibliography is neither a usurper nor a poor relation in the field of textual criticism, but rather its foundation, the grammar of the subject. If, in the interests of brevity, we pass over the important field of manuscript texts and concern ourselves with textual criticism based chiefly on printed books, we may, perhaps, discern three main but by no means mutually exclusive lines of endeavor. The first concerns itself with the authorship, origin, and characteristics of the lost manuscript behind a printed book both in whole and in part. I am thinking first of various studies in the attribution of anonymous works, or of the solution of problems in multiple authorship as in the Beaumont and Fletcher plays, Massinger, and Dekker; and secondly of such studies as Mr. Duthie has made in the bad quarto of Hamlet and more recently in the Pide Bull King Lear . Dover Wilson's reconstructions of the manuscript copy for Hamlet and other texts should be placed here, as also various studies such as Hoppe's of Romeo and Juliet but especially Greg's of Doctor Faustus . As with the Faustus and Lear investigations, according to the circumstances this division may merge imperceptibly with the second, which I take to be concerned with the critical analysis of texts in known manuscripts or printed exempla. Here we might place studies like Grierson's on the text of Donne, Wolf's on commonplace books, Shaaber's on 2 Henry IV. The determination of the order and authority of printed texts after the first also applies, and we must certainly include the very difficult task of separating from compositor's, proof-reader's, and printing-house editor's alterations those true revisions from an authoritatively corrected copy used as the basis for a later edition. The relation of the variants in the Quarto and Folio of King Lear or Troilus and Cressida is such a problem. In all of these divisions various special studies may enter in one form or another. I list as examples a few of the inquiries which Mr. Price sets up as among the subjects for textual criticism: vocabulary tests of authorship, and also of plagiarism, metrical tests including study of broken lines, deficient lines, redundant syllables, feminine endings, prose as blank verse, and so on, applied to form an opinion of a text. Finally, perhaps we may assign as a third general division the orderly bringing together of all this information in an editorial capacity, and the consequent evolution of a modern critical text designed to represent the intentions of the author more faithfully than any single preserved manuscript or printed copy. Whereas the findings of analytical bibliography may or may not be applicable in the first two divisions, the claims of analysis enter full force in the editorial third. In the first two divisions, it is true, the investigations lead hopefully towards the ideal of a definitive text, but, as with pure bibliography, much textual criticism is undertaken either for its own sake or else to attack only a fragment of the total problem, so that the immediate end of the research may not be the formation of a text. For example, Mr. Duthie did not edit Hamlet after he had solved the problem of the bad quarto. It will be convenient, however, to treat textual criticism and its relations to bibliography in its narrower application to the evolution of an edited text and to the various delicate problems that arise before this text can eventually be fixed. Moreover, the limitation may be extended to cover only the specific problem of old-spelling critical texts, for—as Greg's paper has shown—these are subject to certain criteria which do not always apply to modernized versions, even though the basic problems are shared in common. At the start one should distinguish certain editorial problems that have no necessary connection with bibliography. An editor of the literature of the past must have considerable linguistic attainments, or ready access to professional advice. Through long familiarity he must grow to be a native in the characteristic thought, usage, speech patterns, and customs of his period. Although bibliography may occasionally assist in the solution of some problems, or offer a convincing after-the-event confirmation, much emendation—or refusal to emend—much estimate of authenticity, must be made quite independently of bibliographical considerations and instead on a philological basis. This aspect has no relation to bibliography, and it requires a discipline and study which leave little time for bibliographical investigations not concerning the problem immediately at hand. Moreover, if we speak of only one characteristic, the great emendations have been inspired art and not systematic science. One can give a rational palaeographical explanation to derive "a table of green fields" set in type from the crabbed script of "a" babld of green fields," but I beg leave to doubt that this famous emendation would to the present day ever have been arrived at by strictly palaeographic reasoning. Greg, I believe, has no very high opinion of palaeography as giving more than a hint for emendations, 11 although its confirmation is often most valuable. Usually, I suspect, one arrives at an emendation of any subtlety by inspiration, memory, and a strong sense of analogy, and then one brings in palaeography if possible to justify one's conclusions. Many other considerations of text are too frequently confused as soluble by bibliography. For example, bibliography can establish that edition B. was printed from edition A. , and not from an independent manuscript; but if revisions appear in B. , there is no bibliographical technique for determining except in isolated cases whether they derive from the author himself, a scribe revising the text of A. from a manuscript, or an editor of some kind. Such problems in one way or another involving emendation or the acceptance of variant readings fall to the lot of the textual critic once bibliography has cleared his way to the limit of its ability. This critical acumen, which we cannot value too highly as applied to text, is, of course, the product of a keen and imaginative mind; but, again, it is materially aided by a very close acquaintance with one's period in general philological considerations. This acquaintance gradually develops an opinion about speech and imagery which, in mature and thoughtful hands, has its own authority not only in questions of emendation but in any division of textual criticism. We may note that even the conservative, bibliographical McKerrow does not disdain in certain circumstances to write about the authority of variants between editions which best seem to have the greatest internal harmony with an author. 12 This strong and subtle imagination necessary for close inquiries into texts may apply itself to studies in attribution, plagiarism, or multiple authorship, or to studies in an author's speech and metrical characteristics, or it may be found in Dover Wilson's various attempts—whether rightly or wrongly—to discover layers of revision in the pre-printing history of a manuscript, or it may be utilized in the scrupulous examination of the sources and methods of corruption in a text which Duthie has demonstrated in Hamlet and in King Lear . Such striking deductions as those Duthie makes about the composition of memorial texts from tag ends of general recollections exhibit a critical virtuosity which has its own discipline and rigorous training. If I were a textual critic concerned with such matters as I have been sketching, problems involving my total powers as a critic, I fancy I should be rather impatient with a bibliographer who insisted that I should be all this and McKerrow too. And I should be strongly inclined to reply: you are a technician—you do the technical part of this business and I shall apply your findings, taking care that I have studied the principles and general methods of your craft seriously enough so that I can follow your arguments and understand the applicability of what you are saying. This is roughly what has happened, and as a consequence something like the following rationale is commonly accepted. The bibliographer's function is to prepare the general material of the texts, when bibliographical investigation is necessarily involved; and the textual critic, in the light of bibliographical findings, can then proceed to apply the discovered relationships, and to add his own art, to achieve the finished, definitive result. Since we are an age of specialists, this separation of function seems reasonable to us. Indeed, in various cases it may work very well, and in some it may even be positively necessary. Yet I must confess it is a position I held with more conviction in the past than I do today, and I anticipate holding it with even less conviction in the future, especially if certain far-reaching bibliographical speculations and experimental techniques for dealing with the accidentals in an old-spelling text ever reach success. This change in attitude, I am conscious, may have been dictated too much by various experiences with amateur editors, from whom the good Lord deliver us, by a tendency to over-emphasize the importance of a close reconstruction of accidentals, and by allowing the special problems of distinctly unusual texts to bulk too large in my mind so that the uncomplicated, run-of-the-mill variety is obscured. Whatever the cause, I have here what is only a selection of examples to illustrate that a textual critic, when he is himself incapable of applying advanced bibliographical techniques to every detail of an old-spelling text, can seldom achieve absolute authority in his results, and may indeed be led into serious error through the false confidence induced in him by the notion that bibliography has sufficiently prepared the way before his labors have begun. This hypothetical critic can ordinarily be prepared only to follow and apply bibliographical arguments: his training has not prepared him to evaluate their correctness on technical grounds. A small but rather interesting example occurs in Thomas Southerne's Disappointment of 1684. Here the case for a cancel to abridge a censored scene was very plausibly advanced in 1933, and in 1946 was vetted by a good bibliographer who made some necessary modifications but in no way questioned the central thesis. Yet in the last sixteen years if any textual critic had treated the scene in the light of this apparently authoritative evidence, without testing it bibliographically for himself, he would have been quite wrong, for no cancel exists and the scene is not abridged. 13 Secondly, this critic may often be forced to enter upon subjects where rigorous bibliographical investigation has not yet been made, although he may not be aware of that fact. A really egregious case of false bibliography has only recently been corrected by W. B. Todd's study of The Monk . 14 The full story is very involved, but the point is brief. If between 1935 and 1949 any critic had blindly relied on the accepted ordering of the publishing history which pseudo-bibliography had set up, he would have been led to evolve a text which treated Lewis's revisions as the original readings, and the readings which Lewis had discarded as in fact his later revisions. Q. E. D. Don't trust all the bibliographers. This is a pretty fix for a textual critic, since he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. And in fact, in many cases no solution for his dilemma is possible unless he is himself also a trained bibliographer who is capable of re-examining technically a fouled-up problem. Yet he must do something. One course is to trust only some bibliographers. The very best butter. Nonetheless we may well remember in this connection Curt Bühler's favorite quotation of the observation made by A. W. Pollard on his colleague Robert Proctor, a great pioneer in incunabula studies, "that in matters of bibliography he would not have taken the results of an archangel upon trust." As an example we may survey two specific but fortunately minor instances in which Mr. Duthie in his new edition of King Lear was misled by untested bibliography. A small part of his arguments concerning certain peculiarities of the quarto rests on Greg's speculation that two compositors with different habits might have been engaged with the book. Now in this case Greg was not speaking ex cathedra as the result of a detailed bibliographical examination, but only in terms of possibilities. Fortunately the point was of no very great consequence for Duthie's conclusions, because he accepted the speculation on trust and did not test it. We know now, however, from a recent bibliographical study, which can be confirmed by even stricter bibliographical evidence, 15 that only one compositor set the book. These peculiarities, therefore, require another explanation. In the second instance the point of discussion is the mislining of the verse at the opening of Act III, Scene 2, the great storm scene. Greg took the view that the early part is mislined because the compositor was setting the text as prose, and it was not until he reached a certain point that he recognized he was dealing with verse and thereafter proceeded to line correctly. Duthie, naturally, accepted Greg's explanation as 'bibliographical,' and quite properly added that of course the compositor must have gone back to insert capitals at the beginning of each line in the prose section to give it the appearance of verse that it assumes in the printing. However, a single piece of bibliographical evidence demonstrates the mechanical impossibility of such a procedure. Throughout Lear the compositor of the quarto used a short stick for verse and a longer stick for prose; and he never sets prose in his short or verse measure. Since the opening lines of this scene were set in the verse measure, not the prose, the explanation for the mislineation must be sought elsewhere, for from the start the compositor intended to set verse. But other consequences resulted from this failure to see the bibliographical evidence. Because the implications of the short measure were not recognized, in these lines Duthie over-conservatively retained a corrupt lack of punctuation which succeeds in destroying, almost completely, not only a successful flower of rhetoric but also one of the mightiest images of this great storm scene. 16 If the critic finding himself thus abused hurls a curse on this treacherous science of bibliography and betakes himself to his own estimates—to what Greg calls metacritical evidence—he may find himself in a rather vulnerable position. A simple, though typical, case occurs in The Dumbe Knight of 1608 which is preserved with either one of two title-pages, the major difference between them being that one gives the author's name whereas the other does not. Metacritics worked up a pretty romance about this play, conjecturing that Gervase Markham, the author, was so disgusted when he found his play printed with an inferior under-plot by another hand that he withdrew his name from the title. On the contrary, bibliography demonstrates that the title with the name is the true cancel leaf so that the name was added rather than excised. 17 Vulnerability increases when the problem is one of any complexity. Here is a small problem yet one in which an old-spelling editor must make a decision. The inner forme of text sheet A of George Sandys's Christs Passion , a translation in 1640 from Grotius, was reset in the course of enlarging the edition. One typesetting of this inner forme agrees largely with the invariant outer forme in making up capital W's from two V's, whereas the other uses regular W's. Aha, says the critic, I'm not so bad at bibliography myself: obviously the setting of inner A which is consistent with outer A must be the original for me to reprint. The only trouble is, he is wrong. A rather technical interpretation of the evidence of the headlines demonstrates that this setting must have been printed a sheet or so later. 18 The inconsistent forme is the authoritative original which must be taken for the copy-text, and it is probably inconsistent because we may be dealing with two compositors casting off copy and setting by formes in order to get the book started in a hurry. We do not need the example of nineteenth-century editors basing Shakespeare texts on the Pavier Quartos to indicate some of the larger dangers of inferences about the relations of texts made on purely metacritical grounds. But lest we feel too confident about our present abilities to cope with matters more properly the province of textual criticism, such as our ability to construct a correct family tree of editions on the basis of their readings alone, we may consider the case of the ninth edition of Dryden's Indian Emperour in 1694. Certain of its readings are drawn apparently at random from those which are unique in the seventh edition and are not found in the eighth. Others derive from equally random readings unique in the eighth and not found in the seventh. There are three reputable critical interpretations of this phenomenon: (1) the ninth edition comes from an independent manuscript; (2) the seventh and eighth editions were collated at the printing house and the conflation of readings thus results from editorial intervention—or one might even introduce collation of one of these editions against a prompt copy or other manuscript; (3) the ninth is set from a lost edition which may be placed in between the seventh and eighth and on which the eighth is also based. This last would be a favorite with critics accustomed to dealing with manuscripts, and it is certainly the most plausible. At least the first two of these quite reputable explanations might cause some critical perturbation, since fresh authority could have been introduced into the text, and the various new readings in the ninth not found in either the seventh or eighth might demand critical acceptance on their merits. However, when analytical techniques are applied, the answer is not hard to find. Two compositors were employed on the ninth edition, but—perhaps because only one press was available—instead of chopping the reprint up into two sections to be set and printed simultaneously, they set the book seriatim but working in relay. One would compose from four to five type-pages, or only one or two, and then be relieved by the other while he distributed his type, and so on in turn. Since the eighth edition was a paginal reprint of the seventh, what actually happened was that one compositor set from a copy of the seventh, and the other from a copy of the eighth, and so they worked merrily along in relay to the confusion of scholarship, conflating the two editions to form the ninth. The answer is very easy after bibliographical analysis. 19 I do not wish to infer that in all cases bibliographical evidence is applicable. To be properly bibliographical, evidence must concern itself with only certain relations between preserved printed or inscribed pieces of paper. For example, a form of textual criticism linked with bibliography can usually decide on an over-all basis whether variations in a later edition are compositors' variants or editorial revisions; and pure bibliography can demonstrate whether or not this later edition was otherwise set from a copy of an earlier. But whether these revisions were the author's or someone else's can never be decided by bibliography under ordinary circumstances; that is for textual criticism pure and simple. The case is usually not demonstrable by any form of bibliographical evidence. Some critics may deal extensively with evidence which is probably bibliographical at bottom because it is founded on the peculiarities of printed inscriptions on paper; but the inferences they draw may have no relation to the laws of bibliographical evidence. As I shall indicate in a moment, strictly bibliographical deduction is not always possible from bibliographical facts. It is this common confusion about the difference between the strictly bibliographical and the metacritical interpretation of the evidence offered by a book as a material object which places, wrongly I believe, a number of Dover Wilson's ingenious arguments in the field of bibliography. Larger examples may be cited. The Taming of the Shrew problem can have no bibliographical basis, for whatever relation existed between A Shrew and The Shrew antedates their printing, and the manuscripts behind the printed copy of each have no bibliographical relation. Somewhat less clearly, perhaps, the formation of a critical text of Hamlet is not, basically, a bibliographical investigation. There is no direct relationship between the three printed texts. But when pure textual criticism concerns itself with problems in which bibliographical investigation is possible, it can seldom be equally definitive as in this other field, for critical interpretation of evidence is at best inferential, and the logic of the argument is frequently reversible. Until the problem was directly tackled by bibliographical methods, the question of whether Troilus and Cressida in the Folio was set from an annotated copy of the quarto or from an independent manuscript had yielded no convincing answer from the critical approach. Yet Mr. Williams has made the problem seem like child's play, 20 and we may find his study very illuminating for the relative validity of bibliographical and critical methods in such situations. Similarly, Mr. Hinman's authoritative study of Othello and its second quarto contains a most ingenious bibliographical solution of another long-vexed critical problem. 21 There are other problems involving the relations between editions. Greg, I think, has remarked that given two editions only, the critical method could never satisfactorily establish their relationship or indeed, if they are similarly dated, as with certain of the Pavier quartos, their priority. I may be making this more positive or detailed than his original statement, but when we realize that Greg is not thinking in terms of inferences establishing high probability but instead of absolute proof, then we must admit that true demonstration is impossible because of the reversibility of the critical evidence. Is a variant a correction or rationalization in one edition, or a corruption in the other—frequently the case may be argued either way. An example is Dryden's Wild Gallant , which has two editions in 1669, the year of its first appearance in print. One is clearly a paginal reprint of the other, but the question is—which? On the one side we have Macdonald setting up his number 72a as the first edition, whereas Griffith, backed by Osborn, argues for 72b, or Macdonald's second edition. As a part of a fresh bibliographical examination of this play I have elsewhere tried to show in detail too lengthy to be summarized here that while the basic fact on which each hinges his argument is bibliographical, the arguments from this fact are only inferential and therefore do not conform to the strictest requirements of bibliographical reasoning, that is, to a mechanical demonstration for which there is no possible alternative save in the realm of purest fantasy. 22 It will be pertinent, however, to consider more fully in this play certain kinds of evidence which, for a very good reason, have not been published. The exposé, I hope, will offer an enlightening example, though at my own expense, of what bibliographical evidence is and what it is not. I can speak very feelingly on the subject because when I came to the problem as an editor I was completely booby-trapped, and at first I arrived at certain conclusions on grounds which I gullibly persuaded myself were bibliographical only to have the whole argument blow up in my face when at length the true evidence became apparent. A textual collation of the two editions quickly established that there had been no real rewriting between them, but that in a score of places—if 72a were first—corrections, possibly even revisions, had certainly been made in 72b, a few of which could have come only from the author himself. On the other hand, if 72b were first, in various readings the text had undergone a corruption rather more serious than one might expect in a first reprint. Mr. Osborn in his notes to Griffith's argument had confidently pronounced B. the first on the evidence of this textual degeneration in A . 23 This is a critical touchstone which experience has shown to be sound, provided the further inference is made that the author had no part in producing the reprint. However, I approached the Gallant fresh from a study of The Indian Emperour , in which without question Dryden had directly concerned himself with revising not only the second but also the third edition, the year before and after The Wild Gallant respectively. With this example before me, I felt hesitant to accept Osborn's conclusions without further inquiry, for the second inference could not be automatically applied. Indeed, I came to feel that there was just about as much chance that the careless errors of A. had been rectified in B. by an errata list sent to the printer as that A. represented a careless and unauthoritative reprint of B. And I still do not think that the priority of one or other edition can be positively demonstrated on the readings alone. Whether one is corruption or the other correction is not demonstrable in the very strictest sense once we know that Dryden had concerned himself at this date with correcting reprints of at least one other play. I approached the two editions, therefore, not on the basis of the respective 'goodness' of their readings, but in search of some material evidence that one had been printed from the other. Here are some of the highlights of the preliminary case I evolved for the priority of A. In the A. edition, the shortened name Will is almost invariably followed by a period to indicate that it is an abbreviation for William , and this period substitutes for other necessary punctuation such as commas, semi-colons, or even question marks. In B., Will is treated as a simple familiar name and no period is ever found except once—and significantly this once is the first time the name appears. Inadvertent following of copy by B. in this single initial instance seemed the best answer. 24 Given this hint, I continued looking for what one might describe as fossils in B. of strong characteristics present in A. but not in B. Twice in A. one compositor set the extreme contraction b's for be's , and, once later, h'll for he'll . In B. the two h's are normalized to the conventional he's , but the fossil h'll retained. More evidence appeared of what was apparently inadvertent following of copy. For example, the two compositors of A. spelled the conjunctive adverb than indifferently as then or as than . In B. the invariable spelling is than , even when then appears in A. , except for two cases, and one of these turned out to be in the uncorrected state of a press-variant forme in B. where the A. spelling then originally appeared in B. but was changed by the proof-reader to than . There were various other instances in which the isolated appearance in B. of marked characteristics in A. seemed significant, especially since the two pairs of compositors were different in each edition. Moreover, on the textual principle that the 'harder' reading is the original, there were at least two cases which seemed to point to the priority of A. In the first, the form wall in the phrase in A. "she wall write" seemed to derive more plausibly from a manuscript colloquialism wall or wull than from a misprint of the B. "she shall write." In the second, Constance is deceiving Lord Nonsuch that she is with child, and when he demands the name of the father she responds that she does not know. He exclaims, "Not know! went there so many to't?" and in A. she answers, "So far from that, that there were none at all, to my best knowledge, Sir." In B. the repetition went substitutes for were , and it seemed a plausible hypothesis that the 'harder' reading was were , and that memorial failure in the B. compositor carried over the repetition of went from Nonsuch's line. That the A. compositor in such a circumstance, where the repetition seems most natural, saw went in his B. copy and set were seemed more difficult to believe. There is not time to go into this next evidence, but in the light of general experience that irregularities between catchword and following word in an original edition usually tend to be normalized in reprints, it seemed to me at first highly probable that certain irregularities in the A. catchwords were much better explained on the belief that it was the first edition rather than the second. Finally, I attacked the gap of eight pages in the pagination which appears between sheets G and H in both editions. In one edition this identical error could have resulted only from slavish following of copy. Hence if I could establish a reason for the gap in one edition, but no reason in the other, I felt I should have my original. Analysis disclosed that edition A. was set by two compositors in sections of one or more full sheets and that their respective sections can be identified not only by the different lengths of their sticks but also by the difference in the use of skeleton-formes which is associated with each. 25 In B. there is no evidence for any interruption in the presswork between sheets G and H, and indeed it seems likely that one compositor set the last pages of G and continued over into the first pages of H as part of his stint. On the contrary, in A. the gap in pagination occurs between one of the clearly marked sections where the compositors shifted, and it seemed a reasonable inference that when the compositor of sheet H returned to duty and came to make his first impositions, he forgot the system under which he was working and miscalculated the pagination. I had, then, among various other pieces of evidence, the apparent survival in unique forms in B. of strongly marked compositorial habits manifested in A. , among such fossils being the abbreviation of Will , the survival of the form h'll and of a random then spelling. I may also mention a few cases in B. of the very common practice in A. of using a semi-colon for a question mark, the setting in A. of a period in over a dozen cases where a necessary question mark was used in B. , and a very odd but marked use of the full - ed ending in A. for the elided form apostrophe d in B. , an expansion difficult to account for with such frequency in a reprint. Then there were such cases as this. The colloquial form u'm for them is absolutely consistent throughout both editions except for one single late use of them in A. where u'm appears in B. The probability seemed much higher that B. had normalized A. than that A. had wilfully departed from its copy B. There were also two cases where proper names were found in italic in B. , as customary, but in roman in A. , a reversal hard to account for. Finally, the evidence of the catchwords possibly, but almost certainly that of the mispagination, seemed to point to A. as the original. I hope I have made this case reasonably convincing, even in an incomplete and digested form, because I am ashamed to confess that initially—before I began to prepare the text for an edition— it had me thoroughly convinced. Yet I hasten to point out that all these conclusions are quite wrong, that Griffith and Osborn are right. Edition B. indeed precedes A. ; and this case I have presented for Macdonald's order, though based mostly on 'bibliographical' facts, has been one only of inference and probability but never of true bibliographical demonstration. This, briefly, is the real evidence for B. as the first edition which my subsequent investigation revealed. Only one press-variant forme emerged from collation of eleven copies of A. , but from ten copies of B. I finally turned up seven formes which had undergone stop-press correction. Of these, two are indifferent since the uncorrected state agrees with A. for one, and the other is the variant act-heading noticed by Professor Griffith in the apparently unique Texas copy. Of the remaining five, all—in their significant B. readings—have an agreement between the corrected state of the formes and A. There is no need to elaborate the bibliographical argument here. 26 Almost inevitably, A. must have been set from B. Finally, to clinch the case, this evidence developed. On one occasion in A. the verb tells in the phrase she tells me is misprinted as tel's . We can demonstrate the source of this misprint in A. when we find that in the corresponding place in B. the second letter l in tells inks so very slightly in all observed copies that only its tip is visible without a magnifying glass; and since this inked tip would almost inevitably be taken as an apostrophe, the compositor of A. read it as one and faithfully followed what he thought was the spelling of his copy. Correspondingly, in three places in A. where rather essential punctuation is missing, we find that the actual commas are so lightly inked in some copies of B. as scarcely to be seen. The evidence of the tel's alone is sufficient on which to rest one's whole case for the order of the editions; but especially when so powerfully confirmed by the evidence of the press-variant formes in B. followed by A. , one could take the dispute to a court of law and secure a judgment for the priority of B. From this detailed example I draw a moral which applies to much of what I have been trying to say in this paper. Textual and pseudo-bibliographical evidence can seldom if ever afford more than a high degree of probability, and this is essentially different from positive demonstration. A very plausible chain of inferences can be built up, if the person is as stupid as I seem to have been; and if only the same line of evidence is employed to attack such a case, nothing but an indecisive stalemate can result. On the contrary, strictly bibliographical evidence such as that about the tel's and the press variants—evidence which usually appears in texts if one digs deep enough—crosses the line of probability into something close to the field which in science would be regarded as controlled experiment capable of being reproduced. Instead of high probability we have, in fact, practical demonstration on physical evidence of a mechanical nature, demonstrable by a mechanical process, evidence like the prose and verse measures of King Lear , and this is what Greg means by bibliography's treatment of a book as a material object. To every point in my construction of the case for 72a as the first edition, alternatives could have been suggested, and therefore any credibility it possessed depended on the cumulative bulk of the inferences. Yet when actual bibliographical evidence enters the scene, one little tel's sweeps all before it. I draw the further moral as this applies to editing. Such minute yet crucial evidence on which the case hinges would normally be discoverable only by an editor. For example, the ordinary tests which a descriptive bibliographer would apply could not determine the truth; hence, if a textual critic, faced with the problem of corruption versus correction, felt that the standard bibliography of Dryden had sufficiently set up the material for him to proceed with 72a as his copy-text (and he could very well do so), he would be most seriously misled if he failed to come upon the bibliographical points which destroy Macdonald's case. In this paper I seem to have given a considerable number of examples where bibliographers were wrong. I have not intended to cast doubts on the validity of bibliographical findings, or to speak in a way to discourage the faint-hearted from depending upon bibliographical evidence. Quite the reverse. What has been paramount in my mind is, first, that bibliography may sometimes be imperfectly practised; and unless a textual critic is himself enough of a bibliographer to make his own discoveries independently, or else to submit existing bibliographical conclusions about his material to the acid test of his own bibliographical re-evaluation—unless he can do this, in many cases he will be living in a fool's paradise, either believing that there are no bibliographical problems, or else that the bibliographers have authoritatively worked over the material for him and he can go ahead on his own line without further consideration. Secondly, this principle seeps down from the very top, or the choice and treatment of the copy-text, to the very bottom of the last, minute detail of an old-spelling critical edition which must be exhausted bibliographically before pure criticism can properly operate. Thus I think we may freely say that the bibliographer's text is by no means always the best that can be contrived if the editor has not got the mind of a true textual critic—only perhaps that such a text does the minimum of harm. On the other hand, as a practising bibliographer I do object mightily to critics who often nullify the brilliance of their substantive text by failing to observe bibliographical principles when they engage themselves to an old-spelling edition. I should be inclined to set up four operations which an old-spelling editor should perform, for the interpretation and application of the evidence discovered by these investigations lie at the heart of a sound edition. It is astonishing to a bibliographer to find how often various of these have been omitted by an editor who otherwise has exhibited every desire to be scrupulous in the details of his work. First, the determination of authority in all early editions and, on this evidence, the proper choice and treatment of the copy-text as we have heard it described by Greg. Second, the collation of multiple copies of each authoritative edition to disclose proof-corrections for analysis. Third, the analysis of running-titles for the interpretation of the presswork, a matter which is closely linked with the fourth, or compositor analysis, this last being positively essential, at least in Elizabethan texts, for any consideration of the variants between two or more authoritative editions in a direct line of derivation. These few demands are not especially severe and need not require any extraordinary technical training. But I place them as the basis for any bibliographical preparation of an individual text by an editor once the larger questions have been settled. And until they become standard procedure, at least in cases of any complexity where their chief value is found, our old-spelling texts are not going to be definitive in any real sense. Critical brilliance can settle many a substantive crux, although by no means all of them; but if these excellent major substantives are placed in a semi-substantive old-spelling background which is not itself accurate, then the reason for old-spelling texts degenerates into sentimentality or ostentation. Moreover, by an accurate background of accidentals and minor substantives, much more should be implied in many cases than the mechanical ability to copy and then proofread accurately from an old edition. If we are to learn to reconstruct the accidentals and minor substantives of an author's manuscript with as much care as we labor over reconstructing his correct major substantives, a whole new and delicate biblio-critical art is involved in which criticism by itself can never be a sufficiently scientific instrument. I shall try to summarize the main points at which I have glanced. First, both textual criticism and analytical bibliography in their purest states are, in my opinion, independent arts which have no necessary relation in their disciplines, or frequently in the subjects with which they concern themselves. Textual criticism must deal with words and their meanings, with stylistic and linguistic considerations, and with the basic questions of authority in texts, both in whole and in part. Pure analytical bibliography, on the other hand, deals with books as material objects formed by the mechanical process of printing. In many investigations it is not concerned with texts as such; but when it does approach texts it endeavors to treat them not from the literary or critical point of view, which is that of the 'goodness' of readings, but instead as pieces of paper mechanically impressed with certain symbols. The mechanical relation between these sets of symbols is thereupon its chief concern. Second, although the two methods are essentially independent, textual criticism cannot controvert accurate bibliography in its findings when the subject is one on which bibliography can properly operate. However, the two often join in attacking certain problems of texts. These problems are by no means limited to editing, but nevertheless the construction of a critical text is most commonly the point at which the two methods cross. Third, even though the first and the last approach to a text must be the bibliographical one, neither method can achieve definitive textual results in any detailed manner if utilized without reference to the other. On a broad scale it is bibliography which establishes the physical facts of the derivation of texts from one another and which wrings from a given book every last drop of information about the mechanical process of its printing that may be of service in determining the relation of the printed result to the manuscript or printed copy used by the printer. Still on a broad scale, it is the function of textual criticism to evaluate the authority of this manuscript and then to proceed to the correctness and the authority of the words in the text in the light of the ascertained physical facts which bibliography has furnished. Thereupon, in the process of fixing the text of a modern critical edition in every possible detail, the two methods are often so closely conjoined that an attempt to separate their respective functions would be futile. When we come to criticize the average edited text produced today, we find that the usual source of error lies in the insufficient bibliographical training of the editor. Either he has little concept of textual problems, and—scornful of the minutiae which sometimes concern the bibliographer—is content to have any kind of a text, because what he really wants is only a peg on which to hang his annotations; or else he is overconfident in his purely critical abilities to solve any problems which may arise. In either case he has ventured on a delicate literary task without knowing his grammar, and hence his results can seldom be definitive. Sometimes even greater harm is caused by a little knowledge than by none. It is enough to make the angels weep to find Saintsbury, for example, throwing out various correct readings in Scott's text of The Wild Gallant , derived from edition 72b through the Folio and a later edition, to substitute absolute corruptions from 72a under the illusion he was restoring the purity of the text from the first edition. Or to find Davenport in the new edition of Joseph Hall's Poems declining the editorial responsibility to make a choice of readings, and basing his text on the derived reprint of 1598 for the first six books of Virgidemiarum , even though it was slightly revised, rather than the purer 1597 first edition. 27 It is really the hardest job in the world for a bibliographer to convince a critic who is beginning to be conscious of old-spelling problems that an author did not set his own type, seldom proof-read his book and if he did cannot be taken as approving every minute detail of its accidentals, and that a printed book is a fallible second-hand report of the author's manuscript, not a facsimile of it set in type. 28 One of the chief functions of textual bibliography is to try to pierce this veil of the printing process and to restore, however imperfectly, the authority of the manuscript, which we know only through its printed and thus secondary form. On the other hand, a bibliographer who tackles the problems of text with insufficient critical and philological training is also in danger of false judgments in decisions which are not material and are therefore not strictly the business of bibliography. The usual result is that he may retreat to the narrowest conservatism to avoid having to face up to problems which are not wholly factual. And this timidity is as unbalanced as a critic's rashness in proceeding without the counterweight of bibliography. Such critical uncertainty may lead to good reprints of a single authority for a text but by no means to a true edition of the best text of an author. It seems to me that for an ideally definitive work an editor must combine in himself the knowledge of both methods, and the training to put both into practice, or else he must resort to an almost impossible attempt at collaboration. Collaboration can be effective between a bibliographer and a literary critic who will handle all problems of biography, attribution of authorship, literary estimates, and who will write the critical introductions and illustrative notes. In such a case each has his relatively independent responsibilities; and indeed Greg is inclined to recommend this procedure for many editions. But I find it harder to imagine save in the most exceptional circumstances an effective collaboration of bibliographer and critic on the minutiae of the text. I disclaim bibliography as the usurper of editorial privilege, and indeed I am concerned to aid the textual critic against the increasing pressure which editor-bibliographers are exerting on him. But if this potentially most valuable kind of an editor is to produce texts which in every detail will stand up under the increasingly exact and rigorous standards which are now being applied to this form of scholarship, he must learn his bibliography with a thoroughness not previously thought necessary. Only by this wider extension of scholarship can texts be achieved which will not need to be done all over again by the next generation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts * by ARCHIBALD A. HILL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TEXTS WHICH ARE PRESERVED IN MORE THAN one form are objects of study. I. One legitimate aim of such study is the formulation of a consistent way of dealing with variants, and so to make an orderly selection among them, in such a fashion that another student to whom the method has been explained, would be able to make reasonable predictions about which alternatives would be selected by the editor in given situations. This type of study can be called scientific textual study, and is separate from such types of textual study as have for their purpose the improvement or modernization of texts. II. The study of texts can be pursued along more than one line, or by various combinations of lines. There are four principal approaches. 1. The arrangement of differences in the surviving texts can be studied, without attention to the nature of the differences. This constitutes distributional study. 2. Individual differences can be compared with each other in the hope of discovering the direction of change. This constitutes genealogical study. 3. The physical characteristics of the various versions can be studied in the hope of throwing light on the process of copying. This constitutes external study. 4. Differences can be compared for the purpose of selecting those which are stylistically preferable, offer the best sense, are free of mistakes of grammar or fact. This constitutes literary study. III. Each of the above methods of study rests on certain basic assumptions. 1. Distributional study rests on the assumption that it is more likely that unity of manuscripts represents unity in their source than that it represents coincidence. For convenience this assumption will hereafter be called the postulate of unity. 2. Genealogical study rests on the assumption that certain differences are more likely to have been produced by a given direction of change than by another, and the second assumption that differences of this type can be identified by examination. 3. External study rests on the assumption that human or other activity involving physical objects leaves physical effects by which the activity can be traced. 4. Literary study rests on the assumption that an author is less likely to make mistakes than is a copyist, and conversely that an author is more likely to produce a positive excellence than is a copyist. IV. These assumptions are not all equally probable, or equally necessary. 1. The postulate of unity can not be evaluated in terms of controlled probabilities. Further, coincidence does indeed occur, both in manuscript transmission and daily life. The postulate is therefore an axiom, which like other axioms can be tested only by the partially effective device of reversal. That is, we can make the reverse assumption that unity is more likely to reflect coincidence than unity of source. It is immediately evident that the result of such a reverse assumption would be to group together the most dissimilar manuscripts, rather than the most similar. In actual fact, moreover, we act on the postulate of unity in our daily lives. When two students turn in identical examinations, we do not assume that likeness is the result of coincidence. 2. The genealogical assumptions given above would be reasonably easy to establish empirically if no scribe ever deliberately improved his text, but unfortunately the order of correction can reverse that of mechanical change. The assumptions, more generally stated, are contained in those underlying external study, and differ from those of external study only in that they are applied to language material, where those of external study are applied to physical (non-language) characteristics. 3. The assumption underlying external study is the most far reaching of those here given, and is actually the assumption underlying the investigation of all past activity. We act on it so constantly that we scarcely realize it is an assumption, capable of being tested only by reversal—namely by assuming that activity never leaves observable traces. 4. The assumption on which literary study rests is the least likely and the least necessary of the group. It is, however, often the basic assumption of an editor, either explicitly or implicitly held. It has been used as a reason for rejecting the results of bibliographical study by no less a scholar than the late Professor Kittredge. 1 The assumption would be reasonable were authors different from other men (more particularly scribes) in being free from mistakes and stupidities. Unfortunately they are not, as we know if we remember Keats' "stout Cortez." 2 The assumption is not even acceptable if, as with such recent manuscript studies as those of Hitchcock and Wolf, it is made in the more limited form of a means of separating significant variants (mistakes) from nonsignificant variants. 3 Essentially, such an assumption leads to circularity. Variants are first judged as right or wrong. Rightness and wrongness is then used as a means of establishing authority, which in turn is used to establish rightness or wrongness. In other words, if it is possible to judge readings as right or wrong independent of authority, then no attention need be paid to authority. 4 An even more important objection to the literary method is that as yet there is no convergence among critics as to what constitutes literary excellence. It is perhaps to be hoped that such convergence may emerge, but until it does, literary excellence can hardly be a tool in scientific investigation. I wish to be understood—I am not depreciating literary study, or literary criticism. Both have their own proper sphere, and both are legitimate forms of endeavour. I am merely saying that if the student of texts takes as his aim the orderly and methodical presentation of variants, he does well to ignore literary considerations. Note . In ignoring literary considerations I am following the practice of the most important of all general considerations of manuscript study, a work to which I owe a heavy debt throughout, The Calculus of Variants , W. W. Greg, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927. V. After the elimination of literary study, the remaining methods of study can be combined in various ways. 1. Study of texts surviving in manuscript usually makes use of distributional and genealogical evidence. This method can be called, for lack of a better name, comparative study. Note . I am here departing from traditional terminology as used by Greg and other students. The traditional term "genealogical" corresponds to my term "comparative," while "distributional" is not used. 2. Study of printed texts often makes no use of distributional evidence, since for reasons which will be supplied, such evidence is inapplicable. On the other hand, modern bibliography makes great and brilliant use of external evidence. Any method which makes use of external evidence, whether or not genealogical evidence is added to it, can be called bibliographical. 3. Some term which would include all three methods, or any combination of them, is obviously needed. This is particularly so, since bibliographers are apt to think of their discipline as different from the study of books in manuscript, and are also apt to complain of the term bibliography because it is likely to be mistaken for the preparation of hand-lists. The matter is perhaps unimportant, but I should suggest biblistics , or if this has too religious a sound, libristics . Both terms are on the analogy of such others as ballistics, linguistics . VI. It has been stated that the various methods of study can be combined to give complex methods. The various methods can not be combined in a random and inconsistent order, jumping from one to the other at will, unless the results are also to be random and inconsistent. It is then obvious that the student must know the advantages and limitations of each method, and be able to recognize which one he is using. Otherwise he will fail to exhaust a given method systematically before he passes on to another. VII. In all cases where all three types of evidence apply, the normally best order of application is distributional evidence first, then genealogical evidence, and external evidence last of all. 1. Distribution of variants is an objective and readily verifiable set of facts. Further, if the student is lucky, it can lead to a complete and satisfactory conclusion, needing only checking from other types of evidence. 2. Geneological evidence is less trustworthy than distributional evidence, since as has been said, the direction of change is different in processes of correction from what it is in mechanical copying. Geneological evidence needs, therefore, to be used in accord with conclusions drawn from previously studied distributional evidence. An example of a reading from Philaster may make this statement clear. In Act III scene 1, line 201, appears a set of variants, parallesse and parallelless (there is a third variant which need not concern us). Arguing genealogically, one would suppose that the form which drops out one of the two identical series of letters is the younger variant. Yet if we check this genealogical conclusion by the distributional evidence it becomes untenable. The fuller form occurs only in a late and unauthoritative edition, and is therefore a correction which reverses the order of mechanical change. The mechanical change, in other words, occurred somewhere in the limbo of versions of the text which are beyond our reach. 5 3. External evidence might be presumed to be better studied first, and indeed, for reasons of convenience, it is often at least presented in that position. However there are reasons why at least some of the results of external evidence can be disregarded in manuscript work, if comparative evidence applies. 6 It should not be thought that the results of external evidence can be safely disregarded in their entirety, but since some of them can be thus disregarded, there is a danger of confusing the comparative study unless it is exhausted before an external approach is used. VIII. The types of evidence are not equally applicable to every situation. The frequency of applicability is the reverse of the proposed order of study. 1. Since all texts must be preserved in some form, external evidence always applies. It is worth noting that the mere statement that a text is preserved only in memory is a piece of external evidence quite worth having, since it leads to a conclusion about the reliability of the text. 2. Geneological evidence can be applied at any point where a text survives in differing form, but not at any point where a text survives in unity, no matter whether this unity is produced by the fact that there is only one manuscript, or because there is unity among multiple manuscripts. To apply genealogical methods at a point of unity becomes the same thing as the improvement of texts. Note . The application of genealogical methods in the face of unity of the manuscripts is inherent in the "common mistake" method which is the classical Lachmannian technique. Thus E. K. Rand, "Dom Quentin's Memoir on the Text of the Vulgate," Harvard Theological Review , XVII (1924), 209, "The first thing for which I look in the apparatus is the presence of errors common to all the manuscripts, and I find . . . that there are no common errors. Our 21 manuscripts, then, do not descend from one faulty archetype." In other words, an editor in Rand's view, is perfectly justified in disregarding all manuscript evidence if he can find fault with it. Rand would almost have been forced to emend "stout Cortez" in Keats' sonnet. 3. Distributional study can be used only in texts which survive in more than one form. It is often assumed that distributional evidence is valuable only if there are more than two manuscripts, but this assumption is not strictly true since when there are only two manuscripts, the editor must at least record the occurrence of unity and difference, and accept the unities. 7 Distributional studies are powerless to deal with differences unless there are at least three surviving manuscripts, since in the two-text situation no variant has a better chance of having been in the original than another. Distributional studies, further, are not applicable to all texts which survive in multiple form. Before distributional study can be applied, the student must make the assumption that his text goes back to a single original, and that each version of it has been produced by a unified process of copying. If these are not reasonable assumptions, the method can not be applied. For instance we now know that the variant forms of differing exemplars of the same edition of an Elizabethan book are not the product of unified acts of copying, but are a nearly random arrangement of corrected and uncorrected press-variants. A student who attempted to draw a tree for such exemplars would be in a hopeless situation. Distributional studies become valueless when any type of evidence shows that the variant forms are the result of material revisions by the author or another. They remain, however, valuable up to the point at which such a conclusion is proved, and often distributional evidence at least contributes to such a conclusion. Thus the Piers Plowman controversy arose because the distributional evidence had not been exhausted, so that it became possible to use genealogical evidence both to affirm and deny multiple revision. An example of the effect of persistence in a distributional approach can be constructed with the aid of Meredith's Evan Harrington , known to have been revised by the author. A passage in chapter eleven of that novel appears thus in the early form: Eyes were on him, he could feel. It appeared that the company awaited his proceedings; . . . And thus in the revised form: Eyes were on him. This had ever the effect of causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line. Were the fact of revision unknown, and were an editor sufficiently unwary, he might produce the following version, on the assumption that anything absent from either version was an omission from the original of both. Eyes were on him, he could feel. This had ever the effect of causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line. It appeared that the company awaited his proceedings; . . . In such a conflated passage, every word is genuine in the sense that it was written by Meredith, yet the totality of the passage is false. 8 Note . J. Burke Severs presents in chapter three of The Literary Relationships of Chaucer's Clerkes Tale ( Yale Studies in English , no. 96, 1942) a clear example of this principle. His study is of the manuscripts of Petrarch's Latin version of the story of Griselda. He begins by grouping certain manuscripts which lack material found in all the others. This group he sets up as family d. He then goes on to set up a complete, but tentative tree not only for d , but for all other families. All this he does on distributional evidence. He then turns to a genealogical study of the material lacking in d . It is first of all striking that the text reads equally well with or without the additional material. He next turns to a further distributional fact, and its genealogical interpretation. The fact is that all the manuscripts which belong to d lack an accompanying letter of introduction which tells how the first version of the letter had gone astray, and that Petrarch had therefore found it necessary to rewrite it. From all this evidence he then rightly concludes that the longer manuscripts represent an author's revision, and that it is therefore necessary to draw two trees, one for d , and one for all other manuscripts. Such orderly procedure seems a model of clarity. IX. If it can be assumed that the distributional approach is valid, the student makes the following operational assumptions in applying it. 1. Each manuscript before him is the result of copying from one exemplar, though this exemplar is not assumed to be the same for all manuscripts. Mixing of exemplars is assumed not to have taken place unless the variants can be explained in no other way. 2. All manuscripts before him spring from some one ultimate exemplar, present or hypothetical, by one or more steps of derivation. This also will be assumed to be true unless proved otherwise. X. In collecting distributional evidence the student handles the following types of phenomena: 1. Unity . Whenever the same language symbol occurs at the same place in two or more manuscripts, this occurrence can be called a unity. The term "at the same place" is taken to mean "at the same position in a series of surrounding language symbols, whether or not the surrounding symbols constitute a unity." Unfortunately "language symbol" is not a transparently clear term, since such symbols are arranged in a hierarchical series of entities, which for our purposes can be defined as letters, words, sentences, and still larger units such as verses or paragraphs. Thus the occurrence of honor in two manuscripts, once with a u , and once without, is a word unity, though not a letter unity. Usually editors find themselves working on the word level, since most of the time the evidence from letters can not outweigh the evidence from words, and since the evidence from words will fully describe the evidence from larger units. It should be understood that I am using a definition of word which would be unsatisfactory in other contexts: namely that a word is any group of letters with a space before and after them, or habitually so written in forms later than the manuscript under discussion if the manuscript does not divide words. 2. Variation . The occurrence at the same place in two or more manuscripts, of differing language symbols, of zero and a language symbol, or of something not a language symbol and a language symbol, can be defined as variation or difference. The sum total of things occurring is a set of variants, and each thing which occurs is a variant. XI. Both variation and unity, for purposes of comparative study, must be supposed to contain occurrences of language symbols. Examples of either unity or variation which do not contain language symbols belong rather to external than to comparative study. Things which are not considered to be language symbols can be exemplified by blots, tears, ornaments, etc. XII. Sets of variants are of differing sorts. 1. Positive sets . These are sets of variants consisting of different language symbols. 2. Variants consisting of a language symbol opposed to its absence . These are variants which include material which may be later defined as being either omissions, or additions. It is, however, important to avoid using the terms addition and omission until a conclusion has been reached. If the student is not using literary criteria, whether given variants are additions, omissions, or must remain undefined, can only be settled by all the distributional and other evidence. To use such a term as addition before that point, is to prejudge the evidence. A handy term which avoids the difficulty is "add-omission." Note . The general clarity of Severs' exposition of the manuscripts of Petrarch ( loc. cit. ) is perhaps slightly marred by the fact that he sets up his family d on the basis of "omissions." At worst the difficulty is only one of presentation, since at the end of his chapter he clears up the nature of this omitted material fully. But in reading the chapter for the first time, one is left in doubt as to the validity of his procedure, since if the missing material were genuine, omission would prove that d was a late sub-family with an exclusive common ancestor, whereas if the material had been added later, the exclusive common ancestor would belong to the other manuscripts, not to d , and the common ancestor of d would be the original of all manuscripts. Such a term as that I have proposed would avoid this difficulty. 3. Sets which contain one member which is not a language symbol . These sets can be of significance only if the variants resemble each other physically or otherwise. Thus if one manuscript shows a small stain, and the other a comma, or if one shows an illustration, and the other substitutes a description of the illustration's contents, the conditions are fulfilled. XIII. The following phenomena do not constitute either unities or sets of variants for comparative study, though some may be significant for external study. 1. The occurrence of zero in two or more manuscripts . Obvious as the statement may be, it is impossible to argue that two manuscripts are different because one leaves out that , and the other leaves out which . It is likewise impossible to argue, as emenders do, that all manuscripts of a text are descended from a single corrupt ancestor, differing from an unrecoverable original, because all manuscripts leave out something. 2. The occurrence of non-language objects in two or more manuscripts . Thus the occurrence of the same ornament does not constitute a unity for comparative purposes (however significant externally), nor does the occurrence of two blots. 3. The occurrence of a non-language object at the same place with a language symbol to which it bears no resemblance . For instance, a scribble may occur in one manuscript where the other has a line of verse. Such phenomena become simply add-omissions. XIV. The first step in actual study is the tabulation of all sets of variants, disregarding unities. Unities can merely reflect the single original of all manuscripts, and so are worthless for showing differences of derivation, no matter how much the student is forced to rely on them in his final critical text. Note . Elaborate directions for the tabulation of variants are given in the writings of Dom Quentin and the various treatises derived from his work. See particularly, Henri Quentin, Memoire sur l'Etablissement du Texte de la Vulgate , ( Collectanea Biblica Latina VI; Rome and Paris: Desclée and Gabalda), 1922, page 227, Quentin, Essais de Critique Textuelle (Paris: Picard, 1926), pp. 63-72. The presentation of such statistical tables has been strongly attacked, but seems to me one of the great virtues of Quentin's method. XV. When the tabulation of variants is complete, the next step is an attempt to assemble groups of manuscripts. The set of concepts used here are as follows: 1. Derivation . I have refrained from using the word copying, since the two things are different. The distributional student is forced to assume a working hypothesis of copying whenever the arrangement of variants is such as to be compatible with it. Actual copying, on the other hand, is a physical fact, provable only by external evidence. Suppose that our distributional student has this situation: manuscript A shares readings with all individual manuscripts, and has no unique readings. Manuscript B shares readings only with A, and has some unique readings. Such a state of affairs is not compatible with supposing that A is copied from B , since then the shared readings of A are left unexplained. The supposition that B is copied from A is not contradicted by this arrangement of variants, and the student will therefore adopt it. It is, however, merely a hypothesis adopted for the sake of describing the relationship of variants, and is in no case proof that actual copying occurred, since a long series of lost manuscripts may intervene. Further, if a new series of manuscripts is discovered whose variants change the relationship of the whole group, the student will be forced to change his hypothesis. Thus in all such situations it is advisable to speak of derivation—defined as a state of affairs compatible with a hypothesis of copying—rather than to speak of copying. The terminology is more important than it seems, since if copying is the term used, there is grave danger of misunderstanding the nature of the diagram in which the comparative student states his results. Another way of stating the operational hypothesis or procedure here described, is to say that the student begins by supposing, in turn, that each manuscript is derivable from each other, and rejects that supposition each time that he finds evidence to contradict it. 2. Absolute unity . Whenever two manuscripts are absolutely alike in the language symbols contained, they can be treated as one, and it makes no difference which one is chosen to exemplify the pair. This obvious statement is necessary to justify the practise of modern students who often work with photostatic copies rather than originals. The practise is interesting, since to say that an original mediaeval manuscript is copied from a modern photostat is nonsense, but to say that its readings are derivable from those of the photostat is acceptable enough. Once again, derivation and copying are different things. 3. Families , sub-families , lines of descent . Every group of manuscripts which share a group of variants in opposition to those found in others will be spoken of as a family, derivable from some one manuscript, extant or hypothetical, spoken of as an ancestor. A sub-family is a family whose ancestor is derivable from a manuscript which is the ancestor of still other manuscripts. A line of descent is a family, or family and sub-family, which share no ancestor with other families except the original from which all manuscripts are derived. 4. Hypothetical manuscript . A hypothetical manuscript is one which must be posited to explain similarities between two or more other manuscripts, extant or hypothetical. The explanation of such unities is the only reason for which a distributional or comparative student can posit such a manuscript. All other reasons are outside the reach of comparative evidence. Note . This terminology differs slightly from that employed by Greg, op. cit. , pp. 2-3. Greg speaks of inferential manuscripts defined as are my hypothetical manuscripts, and then of others whose existence is suggested by non-comparative evidence, which he calls potential manuscripts. The essential difference is that I am denying that the comparative student can ever take account of potential manuscripts, so that Greg's distinction is unnecessary in my approach. 5. Original . This is the manuscript, hypothetical or extant, and presumed to be single unless proved otherwise, from which all extant and hypothetical manuscripts are derived. It is important to understand its nature. Since all that we know of it is ultimately derived from extant manuscripts, the original can have no characteristics not found in some at least of the extant manuscripts. The original, therefore, must be presumed to be the last version of the text produced before copying of the extant manuscripts and their ancestors began. Any number of lost versions may intervene between it and the author's original, which is forever out of our reach. Note . This view of the original has been held by many of the ablest students of texts, e.g. Greg, loc. cit. , and John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales (University of Chicago Press, 1940), II, pp. 40-41. The view is also in accord with the view of the nature of starred ancestral forms held by modern linguists in the closely similar activity of linguistic reconstruction. For all that, the view is not universally held, necessary as it would seem to be. Note the explicit statement of Wolf, loc. cit. , that the aim of his study was to recover the author's original. What I have called the original is what is called the archetype in Lachmannian textual criticism. I am, of course, denying that the "original" in the Lachmann sense is recoverable. Well known as such statements about the nature of the original may be, they are still necessary since they close the door to much speculative tampering with texts. If the author's original is out of our reach, how much further out of our reach the author's intention—what he meant to write, but did not—must be! Yet, for instance, modern editors still defend Theobald's famous "'a babbled of green fields" on the ground that this is what Shakespeare must have meant to write. 9 I am not, of course, denying that Theobald's words are infinitely superior to those of the old text, nor that I should experience a sense of loss in a reading text which did not adopt the emendation. Yet it remains true that the emendation is without authority. XVI. Distributional evidence can establish the fact of derivation from a common ancestor. When, however, a single group of manuscripts is being considered in relation to the rest, agreement merely offers proof of some common ancestor, and does not define the relationship of that ancestor to manuscripts outside the group showing agreement. Thus if A and B agree 99 times against the rest, A and B have a common ancestor, but this ancestor may be derived from one of the other manuscripts, hypothetical or extant, or may even be the ancestor of all texts. Only the sum total of distributional evidence for all families offers any conclusion, or possibility of conclusion, about the exact nature of derivational relationships. Note . It is exactly this sort of situation which faced Severs ( loc. cit. ), in his development of family d . The eight manuscripts which he set up as family d agreed 13 times against all others. All but two of these agreements consisted of add-omissions absent in d. Not until all the distributional evidence had been surveyed, and then only with considerable appeal to genealogical evidence, could Severs conclude that in effect the d manuscripts were descended from O , and that all others were descended from a later revision. XVII. Normally some distributional evidence will be contradictory. Suppose that manuscript A shares 99 readings with B and C , which form a group that has previously been defined as exclusive. There are 4 readings which A shares with D and E , also previously defined as exclusive. For the neatness of manuscript diagrams, it would be convenient if such difficulties did not arise, but all manuscript experience leads the student to resign himself to them. XVIII. The postulate of unity was given in the form "it is more likely that unity among manuscripts reflects unity of source than that it reflects coincidence." The form of the postulate carefully avoids denial that coincidence—whether caused by convergence of change or by contamination—can and does occur. Yet if coincidence is less likely, it ought to occur less often, even though there is no accurate way of measuring what the proportions of occurrence should be. All that can be said is that the greater the disparity in frequency, the more likely it is that the smaller group represents coincidence. The proportion of 4 to 99 would probably trouble no wise editor. The closer the frequency comes to equality, then, the more suspicious the conclusion becomes. As a result of the fact that frequency of agreement and disagreement is a check on conclusions as to which readings reflect unity and which reflect coincidence, it becomes important for a student always to present a statement of the total distributional evidence in statistical form. XIX. Distributional facts settle some questions about the nature of derivation. Thus if in a group of more than two manuscripts having a common ancestor, all manuscripts have unique readings, and all manuscripts have shared readings in no constant arrangement, these facts are compatible only with derivation of the type known as radiation, in which all manuscripts are derived directly from the ancestor with no intervening sub-ancestors. 10 On the other hand, if the relationship is constant, so that the shared readings of A are always shared only with B , the facts can be taken to be incompatible with radiation. Note . For our purposes, it makes little difference whether the student works directly with an arrangement of manuscripts thought of as proving or disproving a given kind of derivation, or if he works with the Quentin concept of "intermediaries." The Quentin term is a useful tool, but eventually arrives at essentially the same result as is stated in this paragraph. After the intermediaries have been studied and interpreted in terms of derivation, it is again shown that distributional evidence can prove the existence or non-existence of radiation, but can not settle the exact type of derivation if radiation is non-existent. The Quentin term "intermediary" can be briefly defined as a manuscript from a group of three related manuscripts chosen for comparison, of such a character that the other two manuscripts do not agree against it. Thus if manuscripts A , B , and C constitute a family, Quentin would study the agreements and disagreements among them. If A and B agree in some readings against C , and B and C agree in some readings against A , but A and C never agree against B , B is then defined as an intermediary. But the statement that it is an intermediary is not the same thing as saying that it is the ancestor, since it may be the ancestor of the other two, may be the middle term in a straight line derivation, or may be in still other relations to A and C . The concept can, however, be used to establish radiation. Suppose that there are four manuscripts, A , B , C , and D . If A is intermediary in every combination of three, then all manuscripts are in radiation from A. If the relationship is not radiation, then the most that determination of the intermediaries can do is to place some limitation on the possible relationships. Thus if the family of three is in a straight line derivation and B is the intermediary, as above, either A or C can be the original of the other two, but B can not. Much the same sort of limitation, however, is arrived at by other means of studying distribution, as will be shown later. The wise student will, then, use whatever means of comparative study offers him the best possibility of reaching conclusions. The Quentin method is developed in the works by him already cited, but is perhaps most clearly explained in Severs, "Quentin's Theory of Textual Criticism," English Institute Annual 1941 (Columbia University Press, 1942), pp. 65-93. XX. Distributional facts do not settle all questions of the nature of derivation. As stated above, distributional facts can establish radiation or the absence of it, but if radiation is absent, distribution can not establish the nature of derivation more narrowly. That is to say, distributional facts make the presence of sub-families evident, but will not demonstrate which groups are families and which sub-families, unless in turn the ancestral manuscripts can be shown to be derived by radiation. An example may make the statement that distributional facts can not offer a complete solution unless the relationship of groups is radiational, somewhat clearer. Suppose that A and B agree 99 times against C and D where C and D disagree with each other. C and D agree against A and B 101 times where A and B disagree with each other. These facts can be taken as incompatible with radiation. That is to say, A and B have an ancestor which we can call x , and C and D have an ancestor which we can call y . The possibility that x and y are descended by radiation from the original, O , can be disregarded as uneconomical (as I will show), but two other possibilities remain, namely that x is derived from y , and that y is derived from x . No further arrangement of readings within ABCD will establish one of these alternatives. If, for instance, there are some readings where B and C agree against diversity in A and D , the most that can be said is that this suggests that in these instances the readings of x and y were like those now found in B and C . Further, if there are some readings where B and C agree against unity in A and D , we are forced to say that one set of agreements is the result of coincidence, and have still learned nothing about the relationship of x and y . Note . It is this sort of difficulty that Joseph Bedier perceived and made use of as one of his most telling arguments against the whole of comparative study. In his La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre (reprint from Romania ; Paris: Champion, 1929), pp. 51-52, occurs this possible tree for the Lai : In this tree r is a manuscript posited merely for sake of argument, not actual or hypothetical. Bedier sets it up as differing from w five times only, and makes the further condition that in all of these readings it agrees with z . It is thus, in Quentin's terms, intermediate between w and z . Bedier then goes on to say that all the relationships expressed by the tree above would be equally well expressed by this alternate tree, with r made the archetype. In spite of the fact that these two trees as drawn by Bedier are open to some criticism, he is quite right in his main statement, since it amounts to no more than saying that distributional evidence will not settle whether it is w or r which equals O . To settle this question he would have had to give us the five readings, and let us decide on genealogical grounds which tree was better. If, however, we discover a new group of manuscripts which have a common ancestor z , we can now compare the readings of x , y , and z , and may be able to establish that contrary to our earlier necessary assumption, all three are derived by radiation from O . We should not, of course, be troubled by the fact that new evidence upsets a previous hypothesis, but should on the other hand be thankful that our problems are now fully settled. If, however, the relationship of x , y , and z is not radiation, there will be a constant grouping of two ( xy , xz , or yz ) and the only economical hypothesis is that one of the members of the constant group of two is identical with O . But there is again no distributional evidence which will identify for us which of the two manuscripts is O ; in other words, we can not define distributionally which is derived from the other. XXI. The above discussion of ancestral relationships has implied the existence of a tool which has not yet been defined. This is the reconstructed or ancestral reading, which is the result in individual instances of the postulate of unity. The purpose of setting up ancestral readings is twofold. First, only by setting up such readings is it possible to examine whether the readings of possible daughter manuscripts are really compatible with a hypothesis of derivation; and second, the setting up of ancestral readings reduces the number of variants with which the student must deal, so that when ancestral readings have been set up in successive stages, the student can eventually begin to set up the readings of O by a relatively simple process of selection. The reconstruction of readings on distributional evidence can be reduced to a few type situations. 1. If there are only two manuscripts, the ancestral readings can be given only where the manuscripts agree. This statement holds also for any situation where more than two manuscripts have been previously reduced to two ancestral manuscripts. Note . It should be pointed out that an ancestral reading is simply the reading of an ancestral manuscript, and need not be the reading of a hypothetical ancestral manuscript. In the two-text situation, as will develop later, ancestral readings are commonly the readings of one of the extant manuscripts. 2. If there are more than two manuscripts in radiational relationship, the ancestral readings can be given where all the manuscripts agree, and also where some of the manuscripts agree against diversity in the rest. 3. If the group concerned is a sub-family, its ancestral readings can be given where all the manuscripts of the sub-family agree, or wherever one or more manuscripts of the sub-family show a reading supported outside the sub-family at a point where the other members of the sub-family show divergence from each other. 4. In all other situations where reconstruction of readings is possible, some reliance must be placed on genealogical or other non-distributional evidence. XXII. When distributional evidence has been exhausted, the student must proceed to genealogical evidence. Geneological evidence can be summed up as the examination of the content of sets of variants for the purpose of answering the following generalized question: Is it more likely that A is derived from B , that B is derived from A , or are the probabilities equally balanced? Readings where the change seems equally likely to have occurred in either direction can be called reversible, those in which the order of change seems more likely in one direction than the other can be called non-reversible. The first task of the student is to separate the reversible readings from the non-reversible. Thereafter the reversible readings are to be disregarded. XXIII. It is not my purpose to summarize the nature of nonreversible readings, since bibliographers who deal with such entities can be expected to know much more about them than can a strayed linguist like myself. There are, however, two types which I should like to discuss. 1. Instances where a non-language object varies with a language symbol, over a bridge of similarity between the two. A brilliant piece of genealogical reasoning which illustrates this type of variation is Brusendorff's conclusion that the unique reading in one manuscript of Chaucer's Purse "that of eye lowness hath no peer" can be derived from the usual reading "yellowness" by the bridge of an ancestral manuscript which read "yelowness" with accidental obliteration of the first l . That is to say the non-language characteristic of faintness of a letter was interpreted as a meaningful space between words. 11 Similar would be the not infrequent instances of variation between a smudge and a mark of punctuation. Note . Probably the locus classicus of genealogical evidence of this particular type is to be found in the manuscripts of the Dialogues of Epictetus. One manuscript ( Bodleianus, Cod. Graec. Miscellanei 251) has a greasy stain which covers text at the beginning of chapter 18 of the first book. All other manuscripts have a blank corresponding exactly to the number of letters covered by the stain, or present the letters which appear on either side of the stain, without recognition of missing material. In consequence editors have recognized Bodleianus as the archetype of all known manuscripts. The course of the reasoning leading to such a conclusion is clear. It is more easily believable that copyists of manuscripts derived from Bodleianus should have come upon the stain and been unable to decipher the letters which it covered, than that the copyist of Bodleianus should have worked from a manuscript containing a blank, and have then concealed his inability to fill in the blank by putting text into it and covering it with a stain which made the text illegible. For the material on this manuscript family consult Joseph Souilhé, ed. and trans., Epictète Entretiens , Livre I (Paris: Société d'Édition "Les Belles Lettres," 1943), p. lxxii. 2. If a set of variants consists of a non-existent and an existent language form, and if further, the non-existent form can be explained as the result of a known type of mechanical error such as eye-skip, haplography, or the like, the existent form can be presumed to be the earlier, unless the distributional evidence proves otherwise. Note . A typical, if somewhat extreme, example of a non-existent form fully explainable by a series of mechanical errors, is cited by Havet, op. cit. p. 25. A single palimpsest manuscript of Cicero has the startling form COSOSNECVTVTVTVSEGVTVS . Part of this multiple error, resulting in a form which is both unique and scarcely conceivable as an existent Latin form, is due to misinterpretation of abbreviations ("coss. consecutus," i.e. , "consulibus consecutus"), and part to the well known mechanical error of perseverence. It is no wonder that Collomp ( op. cit. p. 9) remarks that this scribe must have been overcome by sleep. The reading of this manuscript is unique, so that an editor would be justified in rejecting it out of hand. Were it, on the contrary, supported in a large number of manuscripts, the distributional evidence might force the conclusion that the mistake was in the original. The presence of a known type of error can, of course, be used to decide the direction of change, even if all the several forms are existent, and offer perfect sense. An example of this sort of conclusion is found in Rand, ( op. cit. pp. 257-58, quoting Quentin Memoire p. 477, and Genesis 19,8). In this passage the variants, all of which offer sense, are as follows: sub umbra culminis mei (9 mss.) sub umbraculum culminis mei (2 mss.) sub umbraculum tegminis mei (5 mss.) Quentin regards "umbra culminis" as derived from "umbraculum tegminis" by the omission of "-um teg-." Rand properly derives "umbra culminis" not from the source suggested by Quentin but from "umbraculum culminis" by omission of "-um cul-," which can be accounted for by eye-skip, where the omission suggested by Quentin can not be correlated with such a type of known error. The caution given above is necessary, since the mistake may have been in O , and the existent form produced by later correction; the relation of the readings parallesse and parallelless cited earlier is an example of this sort of reversal. Nonetheless, it seems a safe assumption that the number of mechanical mistakes will exceed the number of conscious corrections—at least my own experience with secretaries seems to bear it out. 12 The terms existent and non-existent used above need some explanation. I have purposely avoided such terms as right, expected, or understandable, since to use them would be to reintroduce the literary criterion which I have attempted to avoid. Further, a form may obviously be existent without being understandable, as Professor Menner has shown with the unintelligible "lad hem bi lag mon" of Gawain and the Green Knight . 13 To use the term non-existent, however, necessitates an assumption which is inescapable, even though we know it to be false. To say that a form is non-existent in Middle English actually supposes that we know all about Middle English, when in fact we do not. We are, in short, using negative evidence which is always dangerous. There is, however, nothing we can do about it except to be sure that we have made a diligent search before we say that a given form is non-existent. 3. The result of these statements is this: I regard individual pieces of genealogical evidence with distrust, and am firmly convinced that they should be used only after the distributional evidence has limited the alternatives. Also, genealogical evidence should be presented statistically, since some of it will be contradictory, as was distributional evidence. If the non-reversible readings have been well chosen, however, the group of them which is most frequent ought to give trustworthy evidence of the direction of derivation. XXIV. At the end of all his labors, the editor presents his results in the shape of a family tree, leading back to O , whose reconstructed readings he will follow in his text. I should repeat that a tree is a description of the relationship of readings found in manuscripts, and ought never to be understood as a statement that A was copied from B . It merely states that the readings now found in A are derivable from readings now found in B , after examination of all the extant evidence. The fact that the readings now found in B were in historical fact taken from a now irrecoverable manuscript is quite irrelevant to any study of readings and their distribution. I am laboring the point, since students seem sometimes unnecessarily timid in the face of external evidence, particularly of chronology. Even such a soundly courageous student as Germaine Dempster, in arguing for a certain type of descent, finds it necessary to say that the date of copying of extant manuscripts is not out of keeping with her view of the descent studied. 14 Actually an editor who has derived A from B should be quite unmoved by external evidence that B is on twentieth century paper, while A is on mediaeval vellum. Note . The irrelevancy of date of copying for conclusions about the derivation of manuscript readings is a product of the fact that all families of manuscripts must be presumed to have been decimated. The date of copying is, however, relevant in drawing up a tree for printed books which are preserved in multiple copies, so that decimation is much less likely. It is probably a failure to realize the necessary differences between the decimated families of manuscript work, and families presumed to be complete, which is responsible for the fact that the Lachmannian type of student regularly assumed that the oldest manuscript was the best. An example of the way in which decimation can affect a tree is the following from Havet, op. cit. pages 8 and 27. Havet cites a print of the Fables of Hyginus of 1535, which can be shown to be a direct copy of a ninth century manuscript which now exists only in fragments. Not only is such a time-spread a clear indication of the unreliability of guesses about authority based on date of copying, but since the ninth century manuscript is incomplete a student would be justified in deriving the readings of, say, an eleventh century manuscript from readings now found only in the print of 1535. The clearest statement of this principle is to be found in the Quentin Essais , p. 103, in answer to one of his many critics. ". . . 'on sera étonné,' écrit-il, 'de voir une généalogie où le Ms. Laud , du IXe siècle [et autres] . . . dérivent de Leg qui n'est que du Xe siècle. . . .' La vérité, c'est que mes généalogies s'appliquent non aux manuscrits eux-mêmes, mais aux types de transmission du texte qu'ils representent." An astonishing and most misleading misunderstanding of the conditions under which date becomes a good guide is in E. K. Rand's attack on Quentin, already cited, on pages 208-11. Quentin had performed the interesting experiment of copying out a Latin passage twenty-two times, labelling the copies from A , the original, to Z , the copy farthest removed from it. This known tree he then used as a test for the validity of his methods. Rand attempted to show that the classic "common mistake" technique gave surer results far more quickly than did the Quentin system. To do this he assumed that manuscripts labelled with letters late in the alphabet were late and corrupt, manuscripts labelled with letters early in the alphabet were older and more authoritative. Not unnaturally he was able to reconstruct Quentin's experimental tree very quickly, since under these circumstances a mistake was readily and correctly defined as any reading which appeared for the first time in a manuscript labelled with a late letter. Such an attempt, however, is little more than a copying of the tree already given, and can not be accepted as a refutation of Quentin's theories. Rand had strangely failed to recognize that he was working with a family known to be complete, an assumption which would never apply in actual manuscript work. One can not wonder at the tone of slightly aggrieved patience with which the good Dom describes this treatment in his Essais , page 55. XXV. A manuscript tree is a diagrammatic description, and is to be judged like other instances of description in science—by the same criteria that we apply, for instance, to a description of phonemes. It follows, therefore, that like other descriptive statements, a tree is non-unique. That is to say, some other description might also contain and present the facts and be quite different in shape from our own diagram. To say that a tree is non-unique is not, however, to state that all trees are equally good. Two trees are equally good only if they differ at points where choice is truly arbitrary, and in such instances the general similarity between the two should be very considerable. Note . The non-uniqueness of manuscript trees was the basis of Bedier's famous attack on comparative study of manuscripts, from which he concluded that the only defensible method of editing was to select a single good text and depart from it as taste and judgment dictated. The attack is found in its fullest form in La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre , previously cited. He here attempts to reduce all investigations of authority to an absurdity by drawing no less than eleven different trees for this single text. It is true that all of these trees would explain the arrangement of readings, but Bedier made no attempt to judge between them, in spite of the fact that many of them are rather obviously unlikely. The relative worth of alternate trees can be judged by the criteria universal in descriptive science; completeness, consistency, and simplicity. 15 The first two of these are relatively simple to apply, and are universally acknowledged in manuscript work; the third will need special discussion. 1. A tree is incomplete if it leaves any body of readings out of account, or if its author has failed to compare the readings of any manuscript, extant or hypothetical, with those of any other manuscript, extant or hypothetical. 2. A tree is inconsistent if the same evidence, or type of evidence, is used to give contrary results. A startling example of inconsistency is pointed out by Mrs. Dempster in discussing the tree of Manly and Rickert for a part of the Canterbury Tales . 16 For a part of a sub-family Manly and Rickert use the presence of unique readings in each manuscript, and the absence of readings shared with other individuals within the group, to establish that the manuscripts are in radiation. Yet there is a smaller group of manuscripts which belong to the sub-family which they set up as a sub-family within the sub-family, in spite of the fact that this group has no constant body of readings necessitating the setting up of an ancester for it. Manly and Rickert meet the difficulty by assuming that the ancestor of the smaller group which they set up must have copied the ancestor of the whole family without making any mistakes. Thus they have used unique readings and the absence of shared readings to establish radiation, and used exactly the same set of relationships to set up an unnecessary sub-family. XXVI. The criterion of simplicity needs special discussion both because it has not been explicitly used in manuscript work, and because it will be useful to work out the definition in such a way as to give a simple operational procedure. Simplicity will be assumed to be inversely proportional to the number of hypotheses involved in a given explanation. That is to say, if two explanations equally well fit the facts, that which does so with fewer hypotheses will always be judged preferable. Note . While it is true that (to my knowledge) simplicity has never been explicitly used as a criterion in manuscript study, it has, curiously enough, been at least once explicitly denied. Bedier ( op. cit. pp. 66-67) says of some of his less probable trees, "Certes, supposer un O 2, puis un O 3, c'est aller en compliquant toujours davantage. Mais ni la simplicité d'une hypothèse n'est un gage de sa justesse, ni sa complexité n'est une marque de sa fausseté." Such a startlingly unique assumption goes far to explain how Bedier could revolt against nearly a century of literary scholarship. 1. A basic hypothesis which equally underlies all trees can not be used to compare one tree with another, unless there is a difference in the number of times the hypothesis is used. At the outset, then, it is necessary to point out that all manuscript work assumes the existence of a single original, which we have called O . In other words, the minimum number of manuscripts with which a student must deal is always one more than the extant number. Even in trees which do not end in O , the student has assumed its existence, but has made the further conclusion that O is identical with an extant manuscript. At the moment, then, it is important to note that the existence of O is not a special hypothesis inherent in only some trees. 2. A second general assumption is, of course, that manuscripts assume their present shape by copying. In other words, no tree can be drawn without showing lines of derivation. But each such line of derivation is a separate hypothesis, and the general statement of simplicity given above means that the tree which shows the fewest lines of derivation is the simplest. This fact can be used to express simplicity by a simple device of scoring. Suppose that our arrangement of readings for three extant manuscripts is such as to permit either of the following trees: Scoring each line as one, the first tree has a score of three, while the second tree has a score of two. Both trees have assumed that O exists, but the second tree has been simplified by making the separate existence of O unnecessary. In other words, other things being equal, whenever an extant manuscript can be identified with O , a simpler tree results, and this simplicity will always be reflected in the number of lines of derivation. 3. Another type of hypothesis made in trees is that of the existence of hypothetical ancestral manuscripts. Except for O , such hypothetical ancestors are not equally necessary for all trees, so that their presence or absence becomes a measure of comparative simplicity. Further, the setting up of a hypothetical manuscript other than O is a double hypothesis, first of the existence of one more manuscript, and second of derivation from it. Thus in our scoring device, we will count any line of derivation connecting a manuscript with a hypothetical manuscript other than O as having a value of two. Suppose that our tree can be either of the following: The number of lines of derivation is equal, but the simplicity is not. Actually the first tree has dealt with four manuscripts (the three extant ones and O ), the second with five (the three extant ones, O and x ). Our scoring device reflects this by giving the first tree a total of three, the second a total of six. 17 The first tree is then preferable. XXVII. Such a measure of simplicity, rough though it may be, gives the student a powerful tool in dealing with situations which have often been thought to be hopelessly ambiguous. 1. In any two-text situation, or any situation which has been reduced to a two-text situation, either one manuscript must be descended from the other, or both from O . If one manuscript is descended from the other, the resultant tree has a score of one; if both are descended from O the tree has a score of two. Thus unless there is some evidence which positively contradicts the hypothesis, the student will assume that one manuscript is descended from the other, and proceed to genealogical evidence to decide which way the derivation goes. Later evidence may show that his hypothesis was false, but that danger is inherent in all decisions based on evidence. In the mean time, his decisions have been consistent and orderly, and so have a greater probability of being right than if they had been inconsistent and disorderly—unless, of course, one is prepared to defend the horrifying position that there is no order at all in human experience. Note . The statement here given constitutes an answer for one of the major objections raised by Bedier in the work previously cited. He surveyed a large number of trees drawn up by scholars using the Lachmann method. He found that a large majority of them, almost amounting to unanimity, were two-forked trees. Such a state of affairs, depriving the editor of the opportunity of bringing supported readings to bear against unique readings, could not, he felt, be either the result of chance or of falsification on the part of scholars. He concluded therefore that the almost unanimous choice of two-forked trees reflected a weakness in the method itself. If the criterion of simplicity is applied, the student is under a genuine obligation to resolve all two-forked trees, so that Bedier's objection would be met. 2. In practice this statement means that a tree of the type will always be rejected in favor of one of the types given below, which identify O with an extant manuscript. It is for this reason that it was stated earlier that in a situation where both AB and CD had ancestors, it is inadmissible to draw a tree in the form: Such a tree is one which reduces a group to a two-text situation, wherefore it will always be assumed that either x or y is identical with O . XXVIII. Of the three text situation Greg has said: . . . it is clear that, where three manuscripts only are concerned, no merely formal process can throw light on the relationships between them. Either the readings will be all divergent or else the variants will be of the type . . . where one group is represented by one MS only . . . and since, in the latter case, the reading of the single divergent manuscript may always (theoretically at least) be unoriginal, it will never be possible to establish a common source for any pair of manuscripts to the exclusion of the third. Given three manuscripts, therefore, it is impossible either to prove or to disprove independent derivation. This fact, which I call the ambiguity of three texts , we shall find meet us at every turn of the discussion. . . . 18 The measure of simplicity gives us a way of dealing with this situation which no longer leaves it ambiguous. We shall partly accept Greg's statement, partly deny it. 1. There are two types of tree involving a common ancestor for two out of three manuscripts. They differ only in that the second has identified O with an extant manuscript. Both trees are of course types, so that the labels attached to given branches are of no significance. There is a slight difference in simplicity between these two, since the first has a score of seven and the second one of six. The fact that the second is slightly preferable is, however, irrelevant, since the choice is between these two and still simpler types. The simpler types are The first of these has a score of three, and the last two a score of two. By Greg's own statement the more complex trees can offer no explanation of the relationship of readings which is not equally well given by one of the three simpler trees. Therefore, the more complex trees are always unnecessary, and will never be used by a consistent student, no matter if there is a danger that later evidence might show him that his assumption of a simpler tree was actually false. 2. If the three-text situation were truly ambiguous, it would be further impossible to decide between the simpler trees, that is to say, the type employing a separate O and the two types in which O is identified with an extant manuscript. This question also can be resolved. 3. The tree which has a separate O is less simple, it is true, than the other two trees, but it is also true that distributional evidence can establish the fact of radiational derivation. A generalized example will make this clear. Let A, B, C represent the three manuscripts. Let a represent supported readings, and b represent unique readings. We can thus represent a situation in three differing text positions thus A B C a a b position one a b a position two b a a position three If, in this situation, any one of the three extant manuscripts is taken to be the ancestor of the other two, one of the three text positions is unexplained. Thus if we draw the tree in the form the readings in position three must represent coincidence, which is contrary to the postulate of unity. The same statement would apply to any tree placing either B or C as the ancestor. Thus in the situation where there are always two readings against one, but the grouping is not constant, the only reasonable conclusion is radiation from a hypothetical ancestor. Note. . An example of the way in which the procedure I have been trying to outline modifies the results of previous methods can be drawn from the following short Latin poem, to be found in Heinz Pflaum, " Sortes, Plato, Cicero satirisches Gedicht des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts," Speculum , VI (1931), 499-533. There are three manuscripts only, and at page 525 the editor gives the following Lachmannian tree: The reasons for this tree are clearly given on the same page: " N and P bilden eine besondere Klasse, da sie, gegenüber der richtigen Lesart von T , an vier Stellen charakteristische gemeinsame Fehler haben . . . während T nirgendwo in einem unzweifelhaften Fehler mit der einen gegen die andere übereinstimmt. T is durchaus die beste Handschrift, obwohl Str. 35 in ihr fehlt; P , die jüngste Hs., is ziemlich stark verderbt." The tree above gives a stage beyond that recoverable by comparative study, since it separates O and OI . Second, it draws a needlessly complex tree, as the discussion of the three text situation has attempted to show. I give the first verse of the critical test, with variants, as follows: Sortes pre consortibus currit in consorcio; in equis et curribus non est dispensacio. Platonis in manibus sonat disputacio et de sortis cursibus longa demonstracio. In line 2 T has canibus , corrected to curribus , the reading of N and P . In line 4, P has corsibus , N and T have cursibus . In line 4, N has longa , T and P have magna . I am not attempting to draw a complete tree for this poem, but it is striking that the first three variants exactly illustrate the scheme drawn for a three-text situation compatible with radiation from O . It is curious, finally, that the editor in printing longa in line 4, has adopted a reading which his own tree disproves. 4. If, on the other hand, the readings are constantly arranged in a fashion which can be generalized thus: A B C a a b a a b a a b or the readings are all different in a fashion which can be generalized by letting x , y , and z represent unique readings, thus: A B C x y z x y z x y z the hypothesis of radiation from a hypothetical ancestor becomes unnecessary, and the student will adopt the simpler type of tree. As to which of the types of tree employing no hypothetical ancestor he will choose, distributional evidence will offer him no help, and he must base his choice on genealogical evidence. Note . The first of the two schemes given in this paragraph places some limitation on possible trees, just as the Quentin "intermediary" does. The ancestor can be either A or B but not C , if the copied manuscripts are independently derived. If the derivation is in a straight line, either A , B , or C can be the ultimate ancestor, but C can not be the middle term. The second scheme, which represents a relatively rare state of affairs, places no limitation on the possible trees, except that radiation from O is an unnecessary hypothesis. XXIX. It is, I believe, of no use to carry this analysis of the effects of measuring simplicity into situations involving more texts than three, since such situations will resolve themselves into larger radiational groups, two- or three-text groups, two- or three-text groups mixed with larger radiational groups. In any case, it is easy to carry the suggestions I have made into situations involving more manuscripts. XXX. A brief summary of what has been done may be useful. I have first of all tried to follow Greg and Quentin in setting up a method of dealing consistently with variants, making the minimum use of variants preclassified into right readings and wrong readings. In this I differ from the implicit assumptions of many editors, and the explicit assumptions of such students as Hitchcock and Wolf. Second, I have tried to make a few basic assumptions, in themselves as simple as possible—indeed sometimes so simple as to be obvious—and see how far it is possible to carry them. Third, I have broken with Greg, whose view of a tree is that it must be unique before it can be regarded as free of ambiguity. Instead of accepting uniqueness as the only criterion, I have stated that trees are often necessarily non-unique (as Greg well knew), but that in instances where a simple tree and a complex tree both explain the arrangement of variants, the student can choose the simple tree. To do so will be as acceptable as if the simpler tree had been fully proved, since to do so will achieve the aim of distributional study, which is to set up an orderly and consistent method of dealing with the extant variants, subject always to the reservation that when more variants are discovered, the results will have to be re-examined.</field>

"An editor must use his best judgment, and the authority of the quarto does not warrant an inferior reading where the Folio furnishes one that is manifestly better. Otherwise we are forced to infer that prompters and proofreaders can (or could) improve Shakespeare." 2 Louis Havet, Manuel de Critique Verbale Appliquée aux Textes Latins (Paris: Hachette, 1911), pp. 254-55, gives some interesting examples of author's faults, drawn from his own writing, as "en autant la virgule," for "ótant," and "avec écarté," for "avait écarté." Havet draws no conclusion from these variants, but it is almost certain that were they found in a mediaeval manuscript, an editor would assume them to be scribal. 3 Elsie Vaughan Hitchcock, in The Life . . . of Sir Thomas Moore, EETS , or. ser. no. 186 (1932), p. xxiv. "The only method by which we can arrive at any classification is to begin by examining the individual readings of the manuscripts on their merits . . . judging solely on intrinsic probability ." Edwin Wolf 2nd, " If Shadows Be A Picture's Excellence: An Experiment in Critical Bibliography," Publications of the Modern Language Association of America , LXIII (1948), 846. "There are certain hypotheses which should be accepted before an attempt is made to analyse the text. 1) that the author's original or his own revised version—the text which we seek to recover—made sense and was a smooth-flowing verse, so that any variants which abruptly break the flow of a line or make no sense may be classified as corruptions." 4 This statement of circularity is not without precedent, since it is inherent in the writings of the learned Dom Quentin, who made a determined effort to avoid treating readings as right and wrong, and to study them all equally as variants. Curiously enough, however, the clearest statement of the circularity of the method based on "common mistakes" is found not in Quentin's writings but in the unfriendly book of P. Collomp, La Critique des Textes ( Publications de la Faculté des Lettres de l'Université de Strasbourg , 1931), p. 61. "Mais il faut dès à prèsent réfuter l'accusation de pétition de principe qu'on pourrait élever contre le système des fautes communes. Le but de la critique, pourrait-on dire, est de reconstruire le vrai texte; or c'est par le vrai texte qu'on définit les fautes, par les fautes que l'on construit le stemma, par le stemma qu'on retrouve le vrai texte. . . ." Collomp then goes on to reject the charge of circularity, not I think with clarity equal to that with which he has stated the charge. 5 Hazelton Spencer, Elizabethan Plays (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1933), p. 817, textual note. 6 See below, section XXIV, and note. 7 See below, sections X-XIII for definitions of these terms. 8 This example might also be regarded as a merely naive use of the genealogical method. 9 Typical is this note by G. C. Moore Smith in The Life of Henry The Fifth ( Arden Shakespeare ), p. 155. ". . . the words suggested by Theobald are so much in the spirit of the rest of Shakespeare's description, that it is hard to believe that they are not very near to what Shakespeare wrote." Another typical example of this sort of criticism is to be found in Georg Witkowski, Textkritik und Editionstechnik neuerer Schriftwerke (Leipzig: Haessel, 1924), p. 20. "In Lessings Nathan der Weise (II,5) heiszt es in sämtlichen Drucken (Handschrift ist nicht vorhanden): Der grosze Mann braucht überall viel Boden, und mehrere, zu nah' gepflanzt, zerschlagen sich nur die Äste. Es ist höchst wahrscheinlich, dasz Lessing geschrieben hat (oder schreiben wollte): Der grosze Baum braucht überall viel Boden; denn nur so ist das Bild durchgefährt, anschaulich." 10 The statement "compatible only with radiation" is taken to mean that radiation is the simplest hypothesis which will explain the arrangement of variants. The nature of simplicity is taken up below, sections XXVI-XXVIII. 11 Aage Brusendorff, The Chaucer Tradition (London: Humphrey Milford, 1925), p. 253, note. But see also George B. Pace, "The Text of Chaucer's Purse ," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia , I (1948), 107. 12 This statement is a reshaping of Greg's postulate of spontaneous variation, op. cit. pp. 9-10. 13 Robert J. Menner, Philological Quarterly , X, 136. The line ( Gaw. 1725) has usually been emended, but the occurrence of the phrase "lag man" elsewhere in Middle English shows that the emendation is unjustified. A similar example of a form, otherwise unknown, which is certainly existent is quoted by Collomp ( op. cit. p. 63) from Plato's Theatetes . The form is tau , completely unknown elsewhere. But since the form is glossed, and stated to be a synonym for mega , it is clearly existent. 14 "A Chapter of the Manuscript History of the Canterbury Tales ," PMLA , LXIII (1948), 459. 15 It is, of course, possible to judge trees built on different postulates by the worth of the postulates.

      <field name="heading_text">Observations on Two Caxton Variants by CURT F. BÜHLER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TWO CAXTON VARIANTS WHICH PROVIDE the topic of discussion for the present investigation are by no means recent discoveries; quite to the contrary, they have been noted for many years in the standard books of reference. It is most strange, therefore, that these well-known variant states have been subjected neither to critical study nor to thorough technical analyses, especially since, as distinct from many other Caxton variants, it is absolutely certain in each instance which is the earlier state and which the later. This circumstance further permits the investigator to ascertain specific details as to the workings of Caxton's printing office, with special reference to the resetting of copy previously printed at the same press. 1 The two variant states to be discussed here are found in: Lydgate, The Pilgrimage of the Soul , Westminster, 6 June 1483 (Duff 267) and Christine de Pisan, The Book of the Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvalrye , [Westminster], 14 July 1489 (Duff 96). The separate states are identified by the fact that one sheet in each book appears in two different settings of type.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PILGRIMAGE OF THE SOUL In E. Gordon Duff's Fifteenth Century English Books (Bibliographical Society, Illustrated Monograph No. XVIII, 1917), one finds the following note appended to his description of No. 267: There are two issues of this book: in the original issue (B.M.) the two inner pages of sheet f3 have been imposed wrongly, so that what should be on f3 b is on f6 a and what should be on f6 a is on f3 b , and the whole book is in type 4. In the second issue (Britwell) this whole sheet has been reprinted in type 4 * , so as to read correctly. 2 Of the six copies that have survived to our day, 3 the British Museum is the only one to have sheet f3.6 in the original state, 4 the remaining copies all belonging to the later "issue" (contrary to the opinion expressed in STC 6473). Since it is absolutely certain that the Museum copy belongs to the earlier state, one may well ask how it compares with the "corrected" later form of sheet f3.6? The ready answer to this query is that the resetting (though corrected so far as the imposition is concerned) is much the more inferior text. Not only does the reprint contain eleven misprints to seven found in the original setting 5 but it also omits nineteen words found in the original— a fact of much greater significance. To be exact, twenty words are omitted by the reprint but, by way of partial compensation, one word 6 not found in the first setting is added by the second. Almost half the words wanting in the later sheet are clearly omitted because of careless type-setting. The compositor of the reprint, although he was setting type from printed copy, did not follow his original line for line. 7 On the verso of signature f3 (of the reprint) he departed so far from his copy that when he reached the bottom of the page he found that he had less than half a line to accommodate a full line of the original text. By making radical omissions, the compositor succeeded in having his page end at the proper place but not without doing violence to the text. In the original state (f6) the passage in question reads: . . . And leue || it wel y t though the passiō of crist profite not these innocēts to their || ful saluaciō yet it profiteth them so moch y t sathanas lyeth loken in || the depthe of helle / so that he ne may not ne none of his mynystres || [f4] annoyen ne tormenten none Innocent / as their malyce wold / ne || harmen none persone / but by his owne assent . . . In the reprint, the same text (f3 verso) appears as: . . . &amp; || leue hit wel that thong ( sic ) the passion of Jhesu crist prouffite not || these innocentes to their sauacion / yet it prouffiteth them soo || moche y t sathanas lyeth lokē in helle y t none of his mynystres || [f4] annoyen ne tormenten none Innocent / as their malyce wold / ne || harmen none persone / but by his owne assent . . . In making these omissions the compositor succeeded in having his text end with the correct word, but in order to achieve this both sense and grammar were sacrificed to expediency. Apart from this instance, the textual differences are slight and occasionally reflect no more than the spelling habits of two different compositors; 8 for example, the British Museum state has "nought" eight times where the reprint has "not." In those cases where a choice can be made, however, the British Museum setting is always the better. Thus where the soul asks the body "how hast thou lost al thy queyntyse" (BM, f3 v , l. 33), the reprint offers "how thou hast lost al queyntyse." Clearly then, instead of seizing upon the opportunity to improve the text, a careless compositor has permitted the text of the reprint to deteriorate. Curiously enough, the reprint exhibits a technical—as well as a textual—deterioration. Concerning the use of "guide-letters" or "directors," Konrad Haebler 9 observes that in order "to lighten the rubricator's work, the custom was gradually adopted of printing in small type (usually in lower-case), in the space left to be filled in by hand, the initial which the rubricator was to add in colors." This had been common practice on the Continent from as early as 1471-2, and directors appear in books printed at Caxton's press even in the days of its activity at Bruges. 10 In the Pilgrimage , guide-letters were used throughout the volume including the first setting of sheet f3.6, but directors are not present in the reprint of this sheet. Thus the reprint demonstrates the return to a more primitive practice of type-setting where such reminders were not considered necessary for the benefit of the rubricator.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK OF THE FAYTTES OF ARMES To its description of this edition (No. 6648), the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke adds the note: "Das Doppelblatt 140 u. 143 ist neu gesetzt worden." This appears to be the first notification that sheet S2.5 is known in two different settings, a fact that (apparently) escaped the attention of the editor of this work for the Early English Text Society's edition. 11 Of the twenty-one copies of this book known to me, only four have the variant sheet specified by the Gesamtkatalog —Göttingen, Bibliothèque Nationale, Bodleian (S. Selden d 13) and the Grenville Kane copy now at Princeton University Library. 12 Thirteen copies have the text as printed in the Early English Text Society series, while three copies want (among others) the pertinent leaves—Windsor, Bodleian (Auct. QQ supra l. 25) and the York Minster copy now in the collection of Phyllis Goodhart Gordan and Howard L. Goodhart of New York. Seymour de Ricci informs us that the Sion College copy lacks S5, but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to obtain information as to the state of S2 in this copy. Although the Gesamtkatalog simply assumes without further proof that the Göttingen state is that which was "neu gesetzt," there is plenty of evidence to prove that this is certainly the case. 13 In this instance, positive proof is supplied by the different systems of punctuation employed by the two compositors. As will be seen from a perusal of the modern reprint, the enormously preponderant punctuation mark used in the Fayttes is the virgule (/). For example, on signatures S1, S3, and S4 (six pages common to all copies), there are 164 punctuation marks of which 163 are virgules, the remaining one being a semi-colon. In the first setting as represented by the copy in The Pierpont Morgan Library (PML 781), there are 118 instances of punctuation on S2 and S5; of these 117 are virgules and the remaining one is a semi-colon. For the other setting, the Kane-Princeton copy shows (on sheet S2.5) 105 cases of punctuation, of which 96 are periods, 6 are semi-colons and only 3 are virgules. Obviously the text of this sheet was set by a different compositor—one following his own rules of punctuation—than the one who had composed all the rest of the volume. Thus it is quite certain that sheet S2.5 of the Morgan copy belongs to the original setting and that the Princeton one is the reprinted sheet. Again we may enquire what a comparison of the two states reveals and again we will note that the reprint shows a deterioration of text. The state of the Morgan copy has six misprints, while the total in the Princeton setting amounts to some seventeen such errors; two misprints are common to both states. 14 Characteristic of the better text of the first is the reading "Consules of Mountpellyer" (S2, l. 4) where the reprint specifies "Consules Mountpollyer." Conversely, however, the second setting has the more correct last lines in the colophon which read: ". . . he may || atteyne to euerlastyng lyf in heuen. whiche god graunte to || hym and to alle his lyege peple. AMEN. || Per Caxton ||". The first contained the misprints "euerlastpng" and "gaunte." However, since the far greater number of misprints is found in the form as represented by the Princeton copy, we must consider this second setting as the more inferior text. A most singular peculiarity of the Princeton volume requires special mention. The blank last leaf (S6 recto) in this copy shows a distinct off-set of the text of S5 verso, a condition often encountered among Caxton imprints. But the startling fact here is that the Princeton leaf shows an off-set of the original setting, not of the resetting which now faces it in the volume. There seem to be only two logical explanations for this phenomenon, either that the copy was "made up," perhaps when it was rebound by Bedford, 15 or that the off-setting took place in Caxton's workshop. If the latter assumption be the correct one, we would have certain evidence that the copies of the Fayttes were not bound up as soon as printed but that the sheets were stored unbound. 16 Thus it would have to be argued that the Princeton sheet S1.6 came into contact soon after printing (possibly by being gathered with it) with a sheet of the earlier setting of S2.5, but that, in the long run, it was not bound up with this particular sheet. Turning to the other alternative, it seems highly improbable that the blank leaf was added to this copy, 17 since no one would ever have considered it necessary to supply such a leaf in order to create a "perfect and complete" example. Again one cannot assume that only leaf S5 was supplied, since S2 is its proper conjugate; therefore, if anything was added to the Princeton volume, it must have been the whole sheet (S2.5). Furthermore, if the blank be the original one, as we have good reason to believe, it seems unlikely that the important printed leaf just ahead of the useless blank could have been missing from this copy at any time; surely, if S5 was lost, S6 would have disappeared too. One must believe, then, that if the volume is not in the same condition as it was when sold by Caxton (at least, as far as the identity of leaves is concerned), one must assume that the Princeton book was so "made up" that S1.6 was supplied from one copy and S2.5 from another. This seems to be so highly improbable a hypothesis that the first explanation for the presence of the off-set in the Princeton Fayttes appears the more acceptable. In conclusion, a word should (I think) be said on the subject of the origin of these two variant settings. In the case of the Pilgrimage , of course, the sheet was reprinted in order to correct an error of imposition; 18 a similar technical error 19 occurs in the very first book credited to Caxton's press—the Recuyell of the Histories of Troy , [Bruges, circa 1475]. The cause for the reprint of sheet S2.5 in the Fayttes is less obvious. It illustrates, however, a phenomenon previously noticed in several volumes printed by England's prototypographer. Since the second setting contains more misprints than the first, it was probably not called into being through a desire to improve the text. True enough, two glaring errors in the colophon were corrected by the second setting, but this improvement could have been achieved by simple stop-press corrections and certainly would not have required the resetting of four entire pages. 20 It seems likely that the reprinting was necessitated either because something happened in Caxton's workshop which required the resetting of sheet S2.5, or that Caxton failed to print the correct number of sheets to complete the copies in hand and was thus obliged to make good the deficiency after the original formes had been distributed. One must, then, assume that the reprinting of sheet S2.5 was the result either of an accident in the printing office or of a short count when the sheet was being machined. If an accident necessitated the reprint, it is scarcely probable that this took place during the printing of the sheet since it would be an incredible coincidence for both inner and outer formes to "pie" at approximately the same stage in the course of production. 21 If sheet S2.5 was not reprinted because a short count made this necessary, one must believe that some accident took place at the press after the full number of sheets had been printed and the formes distributed, for the loss of a sufficient number of sheets would have compelled Caxton to reset the text and supply the necessary number in a new setting. While this would be a perfectly reasonable explanation for the reprinting of sheet S2.5 in the Fayttes , one can only with difficulty credit a theory which assumes that Caxton permitted such accidents to happen again and again. There are reprinted sheets of precisely this sort in the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers (Duff 123), the Morte d'Arthur (Duff 283), the House of Fame (Duff 86), and probably elsewhere, for aught I know. 22 Surely these could not all be the results of physical accidents. On the other hand, contemporary accounts prove beyond question that short printing was a common enough occurrence to be a source of annoyance and trouble to both printers and publishers. Neither of these explanations for the presence of the variant setting in the Book of the Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvalrye is completely convincing, but if there be a more satisfactory one, it is not apparent to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It is a great pleasure to record once again my hearty thanks for the kind help of Professor Fredson Bowers. In this case, as always whenever he has been consulted, he has been ever-ready to offer advice and criticism. 2 The Britwell copy is now in The Pierpont Morgan Library (Accession number 20892; Check List 1778). Under no. 6474, the STC states: "Sheet f reprinted" and cites only the Morgan copy. 3 Five copies are cited in Seymour de Ricci's Census of Caxtons (Bibliographical Society, Illustrated Monograph no. XV, 1909, pp. 78-79). The sixth copy was formerly in the possession of the firm of William H. Robinson Ltd., and was described by W. Loftus Hare in his study: "A Newly Discovered Volume Printed by William Caxton," Apollo , October, 1931 (11 page reprint published by the firm). Details as to this copy I have as the courtesy of the present owner. 4 Leaf "fiij" appears to be signed "fij" in the Morgan copy, but this may be the result of improper inking. 5 On f6, line 27 of the BM copy, is found the word "lauement" ("lauament" in the reprint); the earliest occurrence of this word noted by NED is 1597. 6 See below, where the reprint has "Jhesu crist" for the "crist" of the first setting. 7 On f6 verso, 27 lines of the first setting have been expanded to 28 lines in the second. 8 For discussions of this problem, see Charlton Hinman, "Principles Governing the Use of Variant Spellings as Evidence of Alternate Setting by Two Compositors," The Library , 4th ser., XXI (1940), 78-94, and Philip Williams, "The Compositor of the 'Pied-Bull' Lear ," Papers Bibl. Soc. Univ. Virginia , I (1948), 61-68. 9 The Study of Incunabula , trans. by Lucy E. Osborne (New York, 1933), p. 112. 10 Guide-letters are found regularly in the Recueil des histoires de Troie (Duff 243) and occasionally in the English version of this work (Duff 242). They appear regularly in the History of Jason (Duff 245), which both Blades and Proctor considered the first large English book printed in England. Blades (no. 9) dates it as belonging to the "early part of 1477." 11 Original Series 189 (1932), edited by A. T. P. Byles. In the re-issue with corrections (1937), Mr. Byles takes note of the two states (p. xxxi) but no variant readings are given in his text. Volume VI of the Gesamtkatalog , which contains the description of the Fayttes , bears the date 1934. 12 This is the former Huth copy, listed by Seymour de Ricci under no. 28.2. 13 The first line on folio B7 recto normally reads: "swīmyīg ouer a gret ryuer / and thurghe thees waye of swī-|| mīg . . ."; in the Yale copy the same line reads: "swīmyn oer a gret ryuer / and thurghe thees waye of swīs-|| mīg . . .". This may represent a variant setting caused by a desire to improve the text or it may be no more than a mechanical variant brought about by having the type pulled out by the ink-ball and incorrectly restored. Another minor variant indicating stop-press corrections may be found on N6; here the "Capytulo" should be numbered 16 but no copy seems to have this number. Some copies (for example: Morgan, Columbia, Yale, Queens [Oxford], etc.) have "Capytulo xiiij" while others (Huntington, Princeton, Bodleian, University Library Cambridge, etc.) have the number "xv." It is not clear which is the earlier setting in this case. 14 On S2, l. 22, both settings have "theunto" for "therunto" and on S5 v , l. 6, "hyeues" for "hyenes." 15 Neither Seymour de Ricci nor the Huth Catalogue (I, 310) indicate that any leaves have ever been added to the copy. According to the sale catalogue (p. 444, lot 1570), the copy is "perfect and large" and was described as being in a binding by Riviere. 16 For a discussion of when Caxton volumes were presumably bound, see my "The Binding of Books Printed by William Caxton," Papers Bibl. Soc. America , XXXVIII (1944), 1-8. 17 The modern binding makes it impossible to be entirely certain, but S1 and S6 appear to be conjugates. Whether conjugacy can be proved or not is immaterial, since it is shown above that no one would supply a blank leaf anyway. Accordingly it is reasonable to assume that S6 is the conjugate of S1. 18 A similar error of imposition occurs in the Fayttes where O 3 verso contains the text which should be found on O6 recto and vice versa. All the copies seen by the writer contain this error. An example of an error of imposition which led to the suppression of the sheet is cited in my note "Caxton's Blanchardin and Eglantine : Notes on the Leaf Preserved in the British Museum," BSA , XXXIX (1945), 156-61. 19 For a discussion of the classification of variants, see my paper "Variants in English Incunabula," Bookmen's Holiday (New York, 1943), pp. 459-74. 20 It has been suggested to me that Caxton might have suppressed the first setting of S2.5 because of the errors in the colophon (representing the printer's official statement) and that the incorrect sheets were withdrawn from the made-up copies and the new sheets substituted for those suppressed. Thus the off-set in the Princeton copy could have come from the first sheet S2.5 before the corrected one was substituted for it. However, this seems to me an untenable theory in view of the fact that only four copies of the second setting are known against the thirteen of the first. If Caxton reprinted and substituted sheet S2.5 in order to correct the colophon, one would (I should judge) expect the majority of copies to have the second (official) setting and only the occasional (overlooked) example to preserve the original reading. If, however, extra sheets of the second setting of S2.5 were printed because of an original short count, it may be argued that these were substituted (because of the superior colophon) for sheets of the first setting to the extent that these correct sheets were available; this also would explain the presence of the "wrong" off-set in the Princeton copy. But one should observe that errors in the colophon did not seem to disturb Caxton unduly; note the many instances of such misprints cited by W. J. B. Crotch, The Prologues and Epilogues of William Caxton (Early English Text Society, Original Series 176, 1928). Other Caxton editions with errors in the colophons include: Ars moriendi (Duff 33), two Chronicles of England (Duff 97-8), Doctrinal of Sapience (Duff 127), etc. 21 Furthermore one would then be obliged to assume that Caxton employed two presses, one to print one forme and the other to perfect the sheets. In that case it is easy enough to believe that one forme might go to pie but that both should do so about the same time passes the bounds of credibility. 22 Such reprintings are not peculiar to Caxton. See, for example, the case cited in my article "Notes on Two Incunabula Printed by Aldus Manutius," BSA , XXXVI (1942), 18-26.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Bookbindings in the Libraries of Prague by ERNST KYRISS *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE SEAT OF THE Przemysls, royal family of the Czechs, and, in the fourteenth century, simultaneously the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Prague owes her reputation in the various branches of learning in large measure to the founding of her University in 1348. As a royal residence from the tenth until the beginning of the seventeenth century, the city contained a considerable number of libraries established by the religious orders, the Metropolitan Chapter, the University, and the nobility. With a single exception, the rich collections of old manuscripts and printed books which existed in an earlier day were sacrificed to the ravages of war and other vicissitudes and were not brought together again until much later. The greatest losses were sustained at the end of the Thirty Years War when the Swedes took with them as booty all sorts of objects of art as well as the main parts of the libraries, especially the famous Rosenberg Library, at the time of their invasions of Bohemia and Moravia. Investigations conducted in Prague libraries in recent years in connection with studies of decorated mediaeval bindings have revealed clearly lacunae which have arisen in this manner. The wealth of the city in book collections is obvious in the following list of libraries whose holdings were examined for this study: The University Library with the libraries of the Princes Lobkowitz, Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz, the Convent of the Knights of Malta (Hospitallers), and the Benedictine monastery Emaus; the library of the National Museum; the library and the Museum of Arts and Crafts; the library of the Municipal Archives; the library of Prince Kinsky; the library of Strahow monastery; the library of the Metropolitan Chapter; the libraries of the Augustine, Capuchin, and Franciscan monasteries; and the library of the Convent of the Red Star Crusaders. A systematic investigation covered manuscripts, incunabula, and imprints prior to 1530, insofar as their bindings were decorated with blind stamps. From subsequent periods up to the eighteenth century only those books were chosen which were once in the possession of well known persons or could be differentiated from ordinary library books in some way or another. In all, 3,020 volumes were studied, of which sixty-nine belong to the period after the Reformation. 1,705 volumes belong to the University Library; 448 to the Metropolitan Chapter; 370 to Strahow monastery; 198 to the National Museum; eighty-four to the Augustines; seventy-nine to the Red Star Crusaders; fifty-nine to the Franciscans; thirty-two to the Capuchins; twenty-five to the Museum of Arts and Crafts; twelve to the Municipal Archives; and eight to the library of Prince Kinsky. The only library in Prague whose holdings go back to the time of its foundation and have not been diminished by wars, conflagrations, and other calamities is that of the Metropolitan Chapter. On the other hand, the famous library of Strahow monastery was not re-established until the second half of the seventeenth century, and virtually nothing remains of its original holdings. The provenance of the surviving portions of the oldest part of the library of Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz may be traced to the founder, Bohuslaw Lobkowitz von Hassenstein, the greatest humanist of Bohemia. In the University Library there is also the former library of the Celestine monastery of Oybin near Zittau, dissolved in the sixteenth century and turned over at that time to the University Library in the Clementinum. Parts of the library of the Danish statesman Henrik von Rantzau are also preserved here, brought to Prague by Wallenstein after he had taken Rantzau's castle in Breitenburg near Itzehoe by storm in 1627. The oldest decorated binding in Prague adorns parchment manuscript A 133, a Latin psalter of the twelfth century, in the Metropolitan Chapter. Both covers, like the manuscript itself, come from Paris and are reproduced by Podlaha. 1 In addition, there is another parchment manuscript of about the same age, B 16;2, containing the De libero arbitrio of Aurelius Augustinus, from the library of Johann Herttemberger de Cubito. Podlaha describes this manuscript on pages 162-165 of his study of the library of the Metropolitan Chapter, and he assigns it to the end of the twelfth century. The general aspects of the execution of the binding and the stamps identify it as contemporary with the manuscript, for it has the characteristic smooth spine with barely perceptible bands (two in this case) and thick covers common to Romanesque bindings. An additional characteristic that may be noted in Figs. 1-3 is the frequent use of stamps whose limits are not marked by special lines for this purpose. In contrast with Ms. A 133, richly decorated with fifteen different stamps of which half represent persons, only five ornamental forms are used (Fig. 1). The yellow leather binding is sparsely decorated. The rectangular middle field of the covers is enclosed by four frames, of which the second and the fourth (reckoned from the edge) are broader and set with stamps, while ribbon-shaped undecorated diagonals divide the middle. Each of the triangular areas formed by the diagonals is decorated with a single stamp. This arrangement of the rectangle is unusual, to judge from available illustrations of other Romanesque bindings. Two clasps closing towards the rear unite the two covers, which measure 198 mm. (height) by 142 mm. (breadth). Presumably the manuscript was bound in what was formerly German-speaking territory. The University Library also owns two parchment manuscripts whose Romanesque bindings, just as the preceding one, were hitherto unknown. The first, Ms. XIV G 48, which contains the Summa Raymundi , is from the last quarter of the thirteenth century, while the second, Ms. XIV H 3, which contains G. Paraldus' Tractatus de virtutibus , was probably written at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Their bindings, which are only decorated with a few stamps representing animals and flowers, are presumably contemporary with the manuscripts. Fig. 2 reproduces the stamps on Ms. XIV G 48. The edges of the boards, covered with brown leather, are consistently rounded to a smooth surface on the front covers. Two clasps which once hooked into place on the back cover were removed in later times. The spine is similar to that of the preceding book except that there are three double bands. Three frames, of which only the middle one is broad and decorated, surround a rectangle that is divided into two parts by a vertical middle band. Both of the two narrow rectangular areas are decorated with a vertical row of stamps. This type of decoration, quite common at the time, is found, for example, in Plates III and IV of the late G. D. Hobson's essay on "Some Early Bindings and Binders' Tools." 2 The dimensions of the covers are 200 mm. by 130 mm. No definite evidence as to the provenance of the binding is available, since the stamps vary somewhat from previously identified forms. The five stamps depicted in Fig. 3 are found on the binding of XIV H 3, a French manuscript. Since the first stamp also appears in quite similar form on the binding of Cod. CCXLII of the Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe, 3 it may be assumed that the book was bound in Paris. The boards are covered with red leather, and their edges are consistently rounded. Four clasps which once closed towards the rear and nine out of ten studs are lacking. The spine is distinctly rounded and reveals the well-defined forms of four double bands. This circumstance permits us to suppose that this binding was executed somewhat later than the two previously mentioned. On the front cover the rectangular middle area is surrounded by four frames, on the back cover by three, of which the first and the third (reckoned from the edge) are narrow and undecorated. The middle area of the front cover is divided in two parts by a vertical line drawn through the middle, while that of the back cover is divided by two vertical bands into three narrow rectangles, each of which is decorated by a row of stamps. The covers are 190 mm. by 132 mm. The rarity of these early decorated bindings, which have been repeatedly and exhaustively treated in the literature, is readily apparent from the fact that the latest study by Hobson 4 reveals only 106 identified volumes in all. The reason lies partially in the fact that in the early period the decoration of leather bindings probably consisted predominantly of blind lines and partially in that a large proportion of these older manuscripts were rebound towards the end of the fifteenth century. Some hundred years after the latest Romanesque binding, parchment manuscript C 104 in the Metropolitan Chapter was bound and decorated with only two stamps. According to a manuscript entry, the binding was executed in 1404. The binder of this book, De diversitate novitiorum , dated by Podlaha 5 in the beginning of the thirteenth century, identifies himself as Prior Martinus from an unknown Bohemian monastery. His name appears again as a purchaser in the two manuscripts VIII B 16 and III D 15 of the University Library together with a note indicating that he came from Wyschehrad, a sector of Prague, with the dates 1412 and 1410 respectively. In Ms. VIII B 16 it is also indicated that he was a prior at that time. The fact that parts of a parchment record from the Strahow monastery were used as the protective leaf preceding the first page at the front of both manuscripts may not be accepted as definitive proof that the monk belonged to this monastery. The following thirteen manuscripts in the University Library came from the same shop: IX A 4, XVII A 1, IV B 25, III C 1, V C 8, IX C 1, X C 6, I D 24, V D 6, XIII D 22, I F 29, X G 16, IV H 2. All were probably bound in the first quarter of the fifteenth century by Prior Martin or one of his colleagues. As decoration for their covers ten different stamps are used, among which the two-tailed, crowned lion rampant in a rhomboid frame appears in two versions, the later of which is enclosed with lines. Bindings from this early period also are numbered among the rarities and have been described only in individual instances in the literature. From the second half of the fifteenth century on we have the period of the Gothic binding with its extraordinarily great wealth of stamp forms, going up into the thousands, and decorations. While the stamps probably were cut only by secular craftsmen, both secular and clerical craftsmen executed the bindings. But provenance from definite shops is still largely unknown today, partially because these binders almost never entered their name in a book and partially because they had no proper guild. Therefore, the search for bookbinders, especially in the tax lists, is extraordinarily difficult. Name stamps of the masters and the monasteries or their arms, which were ordinarily used in only a few of the bindings, are also quite rare. Erfurt is an exception, and A. Rhein has listed the twenty-five names identified thus far. 6 Individual names, for example, Bartholomäus, Jodocus, Severinus, etc., usually refer to saints. Further data on the characteristics of the decorated German binding may be found in Ernst Kyriss, "Der verzierte gotische Einband des deutschen Sprachgebietes." 7 In dealing with such a large quantity of books as the some 3,000 volumes examined in Prague, only those which fall in certain well defined groups may be mentioned and designated by call number, viz. , (1) those for which the name of the binder or the location of the shop is perfectly clear, (2) those bound for a known patron, or (3) those whose bindings are superior to the great majority of ordinary bindings. As far as the imprint date usually given in the following notes is concerned, it should be observed that it is only an approximate indication of the date of the execution of the binding, since books are not necessarily bound at the time of printing or may be rebound years later. The earliest date means only that the activity of the shop did not begin before this time, and the latest means that it continued at least until that time. All references to dates in the following notes are made with these limitations on their significance. Many monasteries had their own binderies, in some of which hundreds of bindings were executed. Thus I have been able to assign 430 bindings to the Heilsbronn monastery 8 and 768 to the Augustine monastery in Nuremberg. 9 The libraries of Prague contain 183 volumes from the following seventeen monasteries scattered from Lübeck to Vienna and from Trèves to Olmütz: Bamberg Carmelite monastery , five volumes with imprints ranging from 1481 to 1512: University Library: Inc. 41 E 9, 41 G 52.

Vienna Dominican monastery: National Museum: Ms. XII E 4. 14 Weissenau Premonstratensian monastery , fifty-four volumes ( infra ). Wiblingen near Ulm Benedictine monastery: University Library: Inc. 41 E 43 of 1489. National Museum: 70 D 7 and 73 D 7 of 1503 and 1506, respectively. The following forty-eight volumes may be assigned to fourteen bookbinders whose names are known: Augsburg Ambrosius Keller: Strahow monastery: Inc. DO III 24. Metropolitan Chapter: Inc. C 31. National Museum: Inc. 69 B 9. Kinsky Library: Inc. 10,201. 15 Jerg Schapf , seven volumes with imprints ranging from 1480 to 1497: University Library: Inc. 40 C 25, 40 E 26, 40 E 34, 41 G 31. Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Inc. IV Da 2. Strahow monastery: Inc. DN V 9, DQ IV 16. Pauls Wolf: Museum of Arts and Crafts: Inc. B 6965 of 1474. It could not be definitely ascertained whether this was the name of the binder or the owner of the book. Just as in the case of the bindings of the chaplains Johannes Richenbach of Geislingen near Ulm and Hans Stumpf of Nördlingen the name is composed of separate, but considerably smaller letters. Erfurt Nikolaus von Havelberg: University Library: Inc. 41 B 21 and 41 B 22 of 1478 and 1486 respectively. 16 Wolfgang Herolt: Metropolitan Chapter: Inc.

Lübeck Hinricus Coster: University Library: Inc. 39 A 17, two volumes of 1473. 20 Tübingen Johannes Zoll: University Library: Inc. 43 A 31 and 44 A 14 of 1496 and c. 1488. In addition there are the following binders whose residence is unknown at the present: C. Eriber: National Museum: Ms. XII F 9. F. Forchen: National Museum: Ms. XII C 10. 21 Mathias Korsser: University Library: Inc. 39 A 27 of 1474. Blasius Orger , five volumes with imprints ranging from 1471 to 1481: University Library: Inc. 44 D 29. Knights of Malta: Inc. IV G 73. Strahow monastery: Inc. DM II 18. Metropolitan Chapter: Inc. D 21. National Museum: Inc. 65 A 1. (Orger had no stamp bearing his name, and he belonged among the very few binders who made individual manuscript notations that they prepared for the binding in question.) This enumeration may be concluded with eighty books for which there is a known patron, which were bound in a particular year, or which have a stamped inscription with the name of a saint: The binder of the Helia Ssech , nineteen volumes ( infra ). The binder with a stamp for the year: Augustine monastery: Inc. N I 13 of 1489, bound in 1491. Bartholomäus , fifty-six volumes ( infra ). Jodocus: National Museum: Inc. 65 D 1. Severinus: Strahow monastery: Inc. DO III 15, V 22, V 27 of 1481-1489. There were 707 bindings produced in thirty-seven Bohemian binderies, and twelve in seven Moravian binderies, but it has not been possible to ascertain the binder or the exact location of the shops. Seven groups, to each of which at least thirty volumes may be assigned, will be discussed later in detail together with 449 Bohemian bindings. From Augsburg and the surrounding territory 103 bindings from twenty-two shops could be identified. Sixty-one books were bound by fourteen Nuremberg binders whose names are not known. The intimate relations between Prague and Leipzig are emphasized in the 305 volumes which came from ten shops in the Saxon metropolis. The following ninety-one volumes may be ascribed to the following cities: Breslau University Library: Inc. 39 B 22 of 1475. 22 Cologne, twelve volumes with imprints ranging from 1470 to 1514: University Library: 25 A 23 and Inc. 41 B 5, 39 E 10, 41 E 31, 41 F 16, 43 F 28.

Görlitz University Library: Ms. IV D 1 and Inc. 44 B 23, 44 C 20 of c. 1471. 25 Krakow, thirty volumes with imprints ranging from 1481 to 1514: 26 University Library: Inc. 40 A 13, 42 B 16, 42 C 13, 43 C 12, 43 D 22, 40 E 17, 44 E 57, 41 F 38, 40 G 3, 43 G 58, 44 G 18, and 65 C 1016.

Lübeck University Library: Inc. 44 G 42. 29 766 bindings were the work of 225 unknown binders who operated in Germany, although the exact location of their shops has not yet been ascertained. From foreign countries, six French and seventy-six Italian bindings were identified. Bindings decorated with ribbons containing inscriptions in German may be listed among those which have been repeatedly discussed and reproduced in the literature, most recently by K. Holter. 30 They are ascribed to Austria in the region between Kremsmünster-Wilhering and Krems-Güttweig during the period from 1460 to the beginning of the 1490s. Although Podlaha 31 reproduces the binding of Ms. D 6 of the Metropolitan Chapter in his Fig. 190, Ms. I C 15 and Ms. VI G 4b of the University Library are noted here for the first time. With these two bindings the number of previously identified bindings with inscriptions on ribbons is increased to forty-two. Of the nineteen cuir-ciselé bindings Bollert 32 has identified the following from the libraries of Prague: University Library: Ms. III D 22 (Plates 10 and 11). Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Ms. VI Ea 1 (Plates 8 and 9). National Museum: Ms. XV B 3 (Plate 14) and Ms. XVI C 10 (Plates 12 and 13). Municipal Archives: Ms Liber contractuum (Plates 16 and 17). 33 Additional cuir-ciselé bindings identified by Podlaha 34 are in the Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A LXXIX 1 and C 5 (Figs. 134 and 181) and Inc. C 62 (Plate IV in Podlaha's Catalogus incunabulorum quœ in bibliotheca Capituli Metropolitani Pragensis asservantur ). The remaining eleven cuir-ciselé bindings are in the University Library (Ms. IX B 2, VII C 19, VIII C 5, VI D 19, Inc. 41 D 7, 41 F 12, and, in the Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library, Inc. II Ab 19, II Da 25, IV Kb 22, VI Ba 23/1) and the Metropolitan Chapter (Inc. E 2). This volume was bound by B. Trnka, and the title "Decreta patr" is incised only on a cross strip at the upper edge of the front cover, whereas the remainder of the binding is decorated with individual stamps. The two rhomboid stamps, the crowned double eagle and the unicorn, indicate relations to the cuir-ciselé bindings described by H. Herbst 35 and which appear in connection with the name stamp mair bb. The bindings are probably the work of several different artists of the cuir-ciselé. Mss. VII C 19, III D 22, and VI D 19 may be assigned to a shop dating from the beginning of the fifteenth century. Mss. IX B 2 and A LXXIX 1 belong to a somewhat later period. Inc. 41 F 12, Ms. C 5, Ms. Liber contractuum, and the four volumes from Raudnitz date from the last quarter of the fifteenth century. Representations of musicians (Fig. 4), soldiers, school scenes, and animals in this last group undoubtedly make it one of the most interesting. The use of this technique on half-leather bindings is also unusual and unknown in the literature. The outer frame of the front cover of Inc. 41 D 7 contains the incised inscription "liber / domini / geor/gi plebani. The remaining bindings should probably be considered as individual jobs. Drawings on leather showing foliage forms are found in the University Library on Mss. VI A 11, XVII C 22, VI F 10, and Inc. 39 A 39 as well as Ms. A 58 of the Metropolitan Chapter and XVI D 8 of the National Museum. The last book differs from the others in that here only the abbreviated two-line title "Bn̾hard 9 srṽ cṽcṽ / cātico♃ appears on the upper edge of the front cover. It has been pointed out elsewhere that the rarity of books with the cuir-ciselé and drawing on leather may be ascribed to the manner of their execution. Two half-leather volumes from the first half of the sixteenth century may be considered unica. They are Inc. F 32 of the Metropolitan Chapter, depicted by Podlaha in Plate XII of his catalogue of incunabula in the Metropolitan Chapter, and Ms. XII D 4 of the National Museum. On the upper edge of the front cover of both the title appears in three lines and is carved in wood. In the case of the second volume the title reads "prima.pars / speculi. sancto/ralis.1.5.2.2." (Fig. 5). The background of the inscription is blue. Fig. 5 also shows rubbings of the three rolls with which the cover was decorated, significant for showing the transition from Gothic to Renaissance styles. A more detailed consideration of the shops to which we may assign any large proportion of the books described thus far leads us first to the Celestine monastery of Oybin. Volumes which came from this monastery may be found in the following libraries: University Library, twenty-seven manuscripts dated between 1434 and 1504: Ms. III A 1, A 4, IV A 10, A 20, X A 18, IV B 4, V B 15, B 19, VIII B 13, IX B 7, III C 4, IV C 4, C 13, V C 16, IV D 11, D 23, IV E 7, E 15, X E 10, III F 17, V F 14, VIII F 19, XIV F 2, IV G 12, G 21, III H 2, X H 7, and twenty-six volumes printed between 1472 and 1515: Inc. 44 A 12, A 24, 44 B 14, 44 C 1 (four volumes, H 3175; 1, 3, 4, 7), C 10, 39 D 11, 40 D 18, D 19, 40 E 21, 42 E 10, E 11, 43 E 18, 39 F 20, 42 F 38, 43 F 24, 44 F 35, 43 G 21, 44 G 17, G 38, 30 H 14, and 33 B 18, 34 B 85, 31 E 16/2. Strahow monastery: twenty-two incunabula printed between 1474 and 1500: DM IV 30, DN III 12, 13, 19, IV 2, 4, 17, V 17, 22, VI 31, DO II 21, 22, III 4, IV 6, 25, VI 14, DP III 13, VI 23, DQ II 11, III 16, VII 14, DR I 6. These seventy-five volumes are decorated with thirty-four different stamps, of which the most frequently used are reproduced in Fig. 6. Characteristic for this monastery is the letter S in a square with a semi-circular elevation at the top. It is always impressed in a special place and in most instances between the crown with five points. The Bohemian lion also appears on a few volumes in the form of a shield. The inscribed ribbon "h.lucas" was encountered only twice. This shop operated from about 1472 until at least 1515. The following books of the Augustine monastery of Segeberg near Lübeck came to Prague with the library of Heinrich von Rantzau: University Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two volumes), XIII C 8, VII E 17, IX F 10, XVI F 23, and thirteen volumes printed between 1483 and 1507: Inc. 44 B 15, 39 D 15, 44 D 3, 40 E 14, 44 E 4, E 42, 44 F 2, 42 G 15, 44 G 57, G 73, G 77, G 79, and 9 A 30. Strahow monastery: Inc. DN VI 18 of 1486. Of the twenty-eight stamps which appear on twenty volumes there is a roll of a foliate staff and a panel in pomegranate form as well as the letter m in a small rectangle. The active period of this bindery extended from about 1483 until 1507. Fifty-four early manuscripts were presumably rebound between 1478 and 1514 in the Premonstratensian monastery of Weissenau, located in Wuerttemberg between the mediaeval trade center Ravensburg and Lake Constance. The larger proportion has already been enumerated by P. Lehmann. 36 While I was able to secure evidence of eighteen different stamps on ninety-seven bindings, only four were used here, among them a frequently employed roll showing a pair of dragons with their necks intertwined. This pictorial theme is not infrequently encountered on Gothic bindings of Southern Germany. With a single exception all of the manuscripts belong to the library of Lobkowitz-Raudnitz: Ms. 234, 241, 245, 247, 248, 266, 411, 422, 424-435, 437, 438, 440-442, 444, 449, 469-472, 474, 476, 479-482, 484, 486, 488, 489, 494, 496, 499-501, 506, 508, 521, 527, 528, 530, 539. In addition there is DA IV 42 from Strahow monastery. Of two binders who were residents of Prague, one was accustomed to signing his name on about half of his bindings with the stamp "bartholomeus," always in a special place. He was active between 1478 and 1489, and fifty-six volumes executed by him are in the following libraries: Metropolitan Chapter: forty incunabula printed between 1478 and 1489: Ab 3, 15, 35, 46, B 20, 25, 71, 86, 104, C 24, 30, 38, 44, 51, 53, 72, 77, D 1, 4-6, 18, 29, E 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, 30, 32, 72, 76, 97, 107, 112, 120, F 3-5, J 60. University Library, ten incunabula printed between 1479 and 1489: 39 A 13, 40 A 17, 39 B 32, 39 C 8, 40 C 27, 40 D 37, 40 E 32, 41 E 22, 40 F 9, 41 F 19. Strahow monastery: Inc. DN IV 20 of 1482. Augustine monastery: Inc. O I 11 of 1485. Red Star Crusaders: Inc. XVIII J 60, LXVI D 2 of 1484 and 1486. National Museum: Inc. 66 C 10 of 1486. Municipal Archives: Ms. 2212. Of his twenty-five different stamps, the most commonly used are two versions of the Bohemian lion and the two-tailed mermaid. Half of the thirty-four volumes from the second binder are decorated with the coat of arms of the city of Prague. His sixty-three stamps illustrate, inter alia , the double-headed heraldic eagle and the Bohemian lion, which, like the municipal arms, are present in different versions. There are also a mermaid and a shield with the unidentifiable initials C W. The books of this master are in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. IV B 24, XVII A 11, H 26, and twelve incunabula printed between 1487 and 1499: 41 C 28, 42 C 1, C 18, 42 D 12, 42 E 22, 43 E 19, 42 F 8, 44 F 45, 43 G 20, 44 G 53. Knights of Malta: II J 68. Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: II Db 21. Strahow monastery: Ms. DF III 4 and Inc. DM II 7, V 20, DN III 15, DO III 21, DQ IV 12, printed between 1487 and 1491. Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. L IV and Inc. G 3, 37 G 35, 38 H 23, printed between 1489 and 1499. Franciscan monastery: Inc. Td 6 of 1493. Red Star Crusaders: Inc. VIII D 17 of 1487. National Museum: Ms. XII A 22, XIII B 17, and Inc. 65 C 9, 69 C 10, 69 D 1, printed between 1480 and 1493. Museum of Arts and Crafts: Inc. C 5335 of 1487. Municipal Archives: Ms. 2097. This binder flourished between 1487 and 1499. In the interest of completeness, it should be noted that Prague's municipal arms appear on bindings in various forms during the subsequent centuries, a fact which may be verified by investigations in the Municipal Archives. It was probably in the first quarter of the sixteenth century that Rev. Bartholomeus Trnka of Krumau was active as a binder. In a parchment manuscript of the University Library, VI B 9, containing the Martyrologium fratrum minorum , he advises that this book was rebound by him in 1527. A quatrefoil stamp surrounds a coat of arms with a wreath and four initialed semi-circles. The initials BT in the upper semi-circle are unquestionably an abbreviation of his name. Of the seventeen stamps identified thus far Fig. 7 shows the ones most frequently used. The following eighteen bindings from his shop are in four different libraries: University Library: Ms. VI B 9, XVII C 19, C 23, F 29, H 5, and Inc. 44 D 43, 41 E 21 of 1499. Knights of Malta: IV B 61; 1, 4-6, 9 (five volumes) of 1506. Strahow monastery: Inc. DM VI 16, DP II 7, DQ II 6, of 1485 and 1486. Metropolitan Chapter: Inc. E 2 of 1489. National Museum: Ms. III H 28 and 71 D 19 of 1518. The binder of the Helia Ssech was also a resident of Bohemia. According to his own statements in the first volume of Inc. 65 A 3 (Cop. 6241) of the National Museum, he was an "administrator" in Leitomischl and a minister of the Gospel. In addition to initials and entwined borders, the first printed page contains two coats of arms illuminated with gold and colors. They also appear on some of his bindings in the same design but as a single stamp. One coat of arms consists of a two-pronged fork, the other of a simple cross. Presumably this binder was active between 1481 and 1494 as revealed by a study of nineteen of his bindings in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. VI B 6, I D 27, XVII D 31, and Inc. 41 E 27, 40 G 10, 41 G 51, 42 G 2, printed between 1484 and 1493, and 33 B 19. Strahow monastery: Inc. DN II 13, DQ III 19, V 19, V 20, printed between 1481 and 1489. Augustine monastery: Inc. N VI 121 of 1493. Franciscan monastery: Ms. Vf 29. National Museum: Inc. 65 A 3 (two volumes), 67 A 5, A 8, printed between 1482 and 1494. Municipal Archives: Inc. G 1451 of 1483. The inscribed ribbon with the word "maria" in two versions and the four rhomboid symbols of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are found among the thirty-six different stamps. Two binders worked for Bohuslaw Lobkowitz von Hassenstein, probably in Komotau. The active period of the older one extends from 1475 to 1486, and thirty-four of his bindings are in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. XVII B 6 and Inc. 44 C 35b of 1475. Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Ms. VI Fe 39 and thirty incunabula printed between 1476 and 1486: I Bc 2, Bd 1, II Ad 18, Db 24, Dc 17, III Gc 25, Lg 9, Ng 1, IV Fd 3, Gd 19, Gg 24, 29, Ka 30, Kb 3, Ma 1; 1, 2, 4 (three volumes), Ma 4; 1-4 (four volumes), V Da 5, Fa 51, VI Aa 2, Ba 13; 1, 22, 23; 3, 24, Ca 19, Cd 1. Franciscan monastery: Inc. Bg 7. He had only fifteen stamps with which to decorate his bindings, among which are the rhomboid heraldic eagle in two versions and the lion rampant. The most productive Bohemian binder was the younger man with 171 identified bindings. Except for Inc. 43 D 8 and Lobkowitz II Ec 16 in the University Library, 73 D 6 in the National Museum, and Inc. C 1839 in the Museum of Arts and Crafts, all the books are from the Raudnitz Collection. 39 Of the sixty-two stamps that he used there is one round stamp which shows a rhomboid field and a lion rampant on a shield divided into four parts. Of the twelve stamps which are used on at least one-seventh of the bindings, nine are reproduced in Fig. 8. The roof-shaped Gothic chain of tendrils appears in five forms. This binder, like his predecessor, and in contrast with the customary style of the time, bound his books almost exclusively in half-leather and arranged the clasps in the Italian style (reaching from the front cover to the back cover). His active period dates from the end of the fifteenth century until 1510, when his patron died. Among the individual stamps which are characteristic for the Bohemian shops are the two-tailed lion, which appears in numerous variations, as well as the otherwise rather unusual mermaid with two fish-tails. One binder, who is presumed to have worked in Wittingau between 1474 and 1500, had among his forty-four different stamps (used on thirty-eight volumes) a small rectangular form with a group representing the Crucifixion and an inscribed ribbon with the name "ulricus". From the group the following bindings have been identified University Library: Ms. I B 7, I C 34, XI C 1, XII D 4, I E 29, E 31, E 46, I F 38, VIF 12b, VII F 25, XIV F 7, I G 22, and twenty-one incunabula printed between 1473 and 1500: 39 A 18, A 24, A 40, 40 A 15, 41 A 26, 39 B 16, 44 B 18, 40 C 12, 41 C 44, 44 D 4, D 42, 39 E 15, 41 E 11, E 26, 44 E 24, E 38, E 55, 40 F 21, 42 F 41, 43 F 13, 41 G 10.

A peculiar characteristic of this master was his habit of frequently combining the stamps in broad, richly decorated transverses as the upper and lower limits of the covers (Fig. 9). Two other shops, of which fifty and seventy volumes respectively have been identified, may be dated at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries and reveal a heavy dependence on Leipzig with respect to the forms of the stamps, the division of the covers of the books, and the use of at most five different stamps on a single book. The first binder had eleven stamps, among which were an ornamental open blossom, a roll and three roof-shaped Gothic chains of tendrils. His books are in the following libraries: University Library: Inc. 41 A 2, B 12 (two volumes), 43 B 25, 41 D 4, 42 D 37, 43 G 28, 44 G 32, printed between 1487 and 1497. Knights of Malta: Inc.

Augustine monastery: Inc. N II 29, III 39, 45, 50, V 82, printed between 1485 and 1491. The second master had seventeen stamps, among them a Gothic foliate staff designed in a negative image and five roof-shaped chains of tendrils. His books are in the following libraries: University Library: twenty-two volumes with imprints ranging from 1483 to 1514: Inc. 43 A 10, 37 B 44, 43 B 9, C 7, 40 D 21, 42 D 1, 43 D 11, 44 D 11, D 18, 41 F 23, 44 F 62, 41 G 1, 2b, 35, 66, 42 G 23, 43 G 7, 45, 44 G 60, 6 H 108, and 14 B 10.

National Museum: Ms. XVI G 17 and 67 A 6, 69 B 5, E 6, 71 B 5, 72 B 9, with imprints ranging from 1482 to 1505. Fifty-one volumes form another group which includes printed books from the years 1472-1507 and are in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. I A 28, VI E 10, VII E 16, XIV H 22 and forty incunabula printed between 1472 and 1500: 39 A 4 (two volumes), 5, 23, 29, 40 A 3 (two volumes), 4, 42 A 13, 44 A 16 (five volumes), 21 (four volumes), 40 B 11, 44 B 6 (two volumes), 10, 11 (two volumes), 20, 26, 41 C 12, 43 C 7, 39 D 18, 40 D 7, 41 D 16, 42 D 10, 43 D 12, 42 E 12, 44 E 19, 37, 39 F 22, 41 F 5, 15, 39 G 1.

The forty-three different stamps include, inter alia , the monogram ih̄s in a pointed oval, x - s in a circle, and a small six-leaf blossom in a circle which is enclosed in a lozenge. The conclusion of this enumeration includes volumes which reveal among their seventeen circular stamps the crowned two-tailed mermaid, the Bohemian lion and the letter m. Eight manuscripts and forty printed books from 1476 to 1488 are preserved in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. I A 47, VIII A 2, V D 11, III E 24, X E 13, V G 4, X H 10, and sixteen incunabula printed between 1477 and 1488: 39 A 21, 34, 40 A 18, 19, 44 A 3, 11, 40 B 18, 44 B 27, 39 C 14, 40 C 10, 41 C 16, 40 D 33, 44 D 1, 44 E 15, 40 G 9, 12.

The remaining portion of this essay deals with books which were once in the possession of well-known persons. It includes the period from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The oldest volumes belonged to Johann von Kolowrat, a member of the old Bohemian noble family that appears as early as the beginning of the eleventh century. He was "administrator" of the archdiocese of Prague and died in 1483. Most of his books were richly illuminated in gold and other colors and adorned with his coat of arms. Pictures of these illuminations are reproduced by Podlaha in Die Bibliothek des Metropolitankapitels , Figs. 294, 302, 309-311. In Inc. Ab 42, C 50 and F 12 Kolowrat made a manuscript entry indicating that he had bought them in 1482. The Metropolitan Chapter has the following thirteen incunabula which belonged to him: A 1, Ab 42, B 12, C 50, E 6, 12, 14, 114, F 6, 7, 12, G 10, J 11; and Inc. 40 A 7 of the University Library and Ms. XVI D 13 of the National Museum also were in his library originally. Of books which were once in the library of Canon Johann Herttemberger de Elbogen de Cubito the University Library owns Ms. A 79; 1 and Inc. 39 D 46, and the following thirteen volumes are in the Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A 28; 2 (Podlaha Die Bibliothek des Metropolitankapitels , Fig. 103), A 28; 3 (Podlaha, Fig. 105), A 73; 2, B 16; 2 ( supra ), and Inc. B 25, 71, C 8, 30, 31, 37, 94, J 20, 56. Inc. C 8 bears a manuscript notation that it was bought in 1493, while Ms. A 73; 2 has a note that it was bought in 1495. Manuscript 418 of the library of the Princes Lobkowitz consists of medical treatises written in 1490 and 1491 by Dr. Ulrich Ellenbog in Memmingen, where he also had the book bound. Ellenbog was born around 1435 in Feldkirch and served, inter alia , as episcopal physician in Augsburg and personal physician of Archduke Sigismund of Tirol, and died in 1499 as municipal physician in Memmingen. The National Museum owns Inc. 66 A 7 (GW 3114), printed before 1473 in Strassburg and bound in Erfurt, originally in the library of Ellenbog's Nuremberg contemporary and colleague, Dr. Hartmann Schedel (1440-1514). Schedel, a Nuremberg physician, was accustomed to identifying all his books with a red mark of ownership, usually inside of the front cover. The family coat of arms, designed around a Negro's head, was usually painted on the lower edge of the first written or printed page. Most of his library, which once consisted of more than 600 works, is a well known treasure of the Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Accordingly, it is quite unusual to find his books in other libraries. Schedel is famous above all for his Weltchronik , printed in 1493 in Nuremberg in two editions with Latin and German texts and illustrated with almost 1,800 woodcuts, the most richly decorated printed book of the fifteenth century. A third great book collector was the Nuremberg jurist and humanist, Dr. Christoph Scheurl. In his case, too, only scattered examples of his books may be located in public libraries, since the collection remained in the ownership of the family. Scheurl was born in Nuremberg in 1481 and died there in 1542. Inc. 42 D 35 of the University Library, containing three Venetian imprints of 1494 and 1495 (H 12220, HC 10824, and C 4555), is in an Italian binding and has an ownership notation dated 1500. In addition, on the inside of the front cover is the wood-cut bookplate Scheurl-Tucher (Warnecke no. 1896 40 ), while that of Scheurl and his two sons is pasted on the inside of the back cover. The student Andreas Schwob of Freystadt left nine books, of which four are in the University Library (Inc. 41 C 14, D 15, G 5, 42 G 27) and five in Strahow monastery (Inc. DN IV 5, DO II 14, VI 32, DQ III 1, 18). According to notes in his own hand, he bought them in 1490-1493 while he was a student in the University of Leipzig. It may be assumed that Schwob studied theology, since the books contain fifteen theological treatises, one historical and one legal work. Such notes, rather uncommon in general, can give ( inter alia ) information about the locality in which the bindings were executed. Far out ahead of other sixteenth century collectors, Peter Vok von Rosenberg holds first place with the rich library collected at his estates in Bechin, Krumau, and Wittingau. When he died without issue at the age of seventy-three, all his property reverted to the crown. In 1647 his books were transferred to Prague, but in the next year they were sent to Sweden as booty of war. 41 A book plate engraved by Aug. Sadeler in 1609 was executed in three different sizes and is used as the mark of ownership. In general the largest was used for folios (Warnecke, Plate XVI), and only in Ms. VII F 25 of the University Library could an example of the smallest be found. In spite of the sequestration, a hundred volumes could be found in Prague: University Library: Forty-three manuscripts: I A 32, 35, 39, XIII A 1a, I B 7, 14, 25, 32, I C 10, 11, 34, 40, XI C 1, I D 16, 24, 30, 44, VI D 15, XII D 4, 14, XIII D 23, I E 5, 29-31, 41, 46, I F 10, 21, 37, 38, VIF 12b, 20, VII F 25, XIV F 7, I G 12, 13, 22, XIII G 2, 6, 10, 19, VIII H 54, and fifty-three incunabula: 39 A 18, 40 A 15, 39 B 21, 25, 40 B 1, 9, 10, 13, 44 B 13, 40 C 2, 41 C 13, 21, 42 C 5, 44 C 4, 39 D 22, 27, 40 D 3, 17, 41 D 4, 43 D 11, 44 D 4, 10, 11, 18, 39 E 10, 15, 41 E 7, 11, 26, 29, 42 E 21, 44 E 3, 26, 33, 38, 45, 55, 39 F 9, 12, 40 F 7, 18, 41 F 16, 25, 42 F 41, 43 F 12, 13, 44 F 48, 63, 41 G 2b, 26, 39, 66, 43 G 28. National Museum: Ms. XIV E 14, Inc. 66 C 1, 67 C 8. Capuchin monastery: Inc. N 33. Moreover, fifty-six have the ownership mark of the Augustine monastery in Wittingau, nineteen that of the monastery in Borovany. The binding of the printed book 22 G 303 (1596) in the University Library has an oval panel stamp in black, fifty-nine mm. in height in the center of both the front and back covers. One panel reproduces the arms of Rosenberg with the numeral 1586, the other only a thirteen-line inscription within a frame (also inscribed). From the library of the older brother, Wilhelm von Rosenberg (died 1592), one volume has been located in the University Library and another in the Provincial Archives. On the front cover of both books his arms appear as a panel stamp, but in two different forms. The first book (54 B 13) is in the University Library and was printed in Bohemia in 1574, and the second, Ms. Wodnian 9, was bound in 1560 according to the stamped inscription. The University Library's 1544 imprint with call number 12 H 141 is identified by a coat of arms accompanied by an inscription on the front cover indicating that it was once the property of the president of the Prague Appelate Court, Johann von Hasenburg. It may probably be dated in the middle of the sixteenth century. Printed books 19 C 92 of 1597 and 14 J 176 of 1551 in the same library have a bust of Tycho Brahe in an oval inscribed frame on the front cover and his coat of arms in black or gold impressions on the back cover. Both panels are reproduced by Bogeng 42 in a form somewhat smaller than the original. The older book, Erasmus Reinholdus' Prutenicœ tabulœ cœlestium motuum , is the presentation copy of the author to Counts Johann Georg and Johann Albert von Mansfeld, according to a manuscript note in red ink. Tycho himself has written in the volume that he bought it in Prague in 1601. Born in 1546 in Denmark, Tycho lived in his native land until 1597 and then spent the last four years of his life in Prague. The mark of ownership of the Danish statesman, historian, and wealthy art patron Henrik von Rantzau has been identified in eighteen volumes. From 1556 until his death in 1598 he was "Statthalter" of Slesvik-Holstein, and, as we have already noted, his books came to Prague as booty of war. Identified volumes are located in the following libraries: University Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two volumes), XIII C 12, IX F 10, XIV H 28, and Inc. 39 A 17 (two volumes), 44 B 15, 41 C 9, 43 E 23, 42 F 35, 43 F 4, 40, 42 G 15, 44 G 57 and 16 A 42, 24 B 5. Strahow monastery: Inc. DO IV 19. In addition to these early bindings decorated with single stamps, six additional ones from a later period have been identified on which the decoration consists of rolls and panel stamps. In the University Library there are 14 A 42, H 13, 16 H 48, while the Knights of Malta owned C VI K 232; 6, 7, 9 (three volumes). Judging from the latter, Rantzau had four different panel stamps, two with his arms and the inscription "Heinrich Rantzau Stathalter" and two with the arms of his wife and different inscriptions. The smaller pair of panel stamps with the notation "Christinna von Halle" is described by Haebler. 43 The larger panel stamps, used on 14 A 42, printed in 1572 and bought by Rantzau in 1574, vary from the others in the use of the numerical date 1572 in the panel of the man and in the use of the spelling "Christinae von Halle" (Fig. 10). In addition to the panel stamps, rolls with the initials G.V. are used (described by Haebler 44 ). Castiglione's Il libro del cortegiano of 1541, shelved in the University Library as 13 J 114, represents the end of the sixteenth century. According to an inscription impressed in the center field of the rear cover, the richly gilded binding of brown leather drawn over cardboard covers was probably executed in Rome between 1541 and 1547 for Apollonius Philaretus, the papal secretary. Its rarity was established by Hobson, 45 who, although he dealt with this collector in detail, did not know this book. All in all, he could identify only nine bindings. The general execution and the decoration of the cover is similar to the one reproduced by Hobson as Plate 54. The two following centuries have produced only a few worth-while items for the University Library. The parchment-bound imprint of 1694 with the call number 5 J 62 comes from the collection of the old Bohemian noble family of Sternberg. A coat of arms within an oval laurel wreath with the inscription "Ignatius Carolus Comes de Sternberg" is impressed in gold in the center of the cover. A German book, C II D 58, from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, belongs to the Knights of Malta, and a Czech folio, 54 A 36, of the same period, belongs to the University Library. It is quite certain that both of them were printed and bound for the bibliophile Count Franz Anton von Sporck (born 1662). They are richly decorated with woodcuts, among which the baronial arms frequently appear. The coat of arms of the patron within a baroque frame is the sole decoration of the cover and appears in the form of a panel stamp 289 x 214 mm. in size. Another German book, Die Tugend-Schule der Christen , a Prague imprint of 1715, is also preserved in a similar binding in the State Library in Eichstätt with call number Lit. N IV 160 (Fig. 11) and in the Library of the Landesgewerbemuseum in Stuttgart under No. 3822. Sporck was a patron of all fields of art. Among other projects, he maintained a theatre in Prague from his private fortune, and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer was one of his architects. In Kukus, his estate in north Bohemia, he established his own press. He died in Lissa in 1738. After this inspection of the treasures of the libraries of Prague, it may be stated that the Bohemian capital attained a high level of achievement in the narrow field of the book arts, and close relations with Germany have been noted. But the high competence of these craftsmen, designers, stamp cutters, and bookbinders only becomes apparent after a study of the fine craftsmanship and well handled materials in bindings which are hundreds of years old.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida: The Relationship of Quarto and Folio by PHILIP WILLIAMS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOR MOST OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS OF WHICH pre-folio quarto texts as well as the folio text itself exist, the relationship between Q and F has been determined. 1 About certain of the plays, however, some question remains. Troilus and Cressida is such a play. Two early printed editions of Troilus and Cressida exist: the quarto printed in 1609 by George Eld for the publishers Richard Bonion and Henry Walley, and the text in the first Folio published in 1623. Conclusive evidence as to the relationship of the Q and F texts has not been presented; it is the purpose of this article to offer new evidence that will establish, on a bibliographical basis, the textual relationship of the two extant early printed editions of the play. Serious study of the relationship of the Q and F texts of Troilus and Cressida began with the work of the editors of The Cambridge Shakespeare in 1865. W. G. Clark and W. A. Wright expressed a theory about the relationship that was widely accepted for the next fifty years: The two texts differ in many single words: sometimes the difference is clearly owing to a clerical or typographical error, but in other cases it appears to result from deliberate correction, first by the author himself, and secondly by some less skillful hand. . . . On the whole we are of the opinion that the Quarto was printed from a transcript of the author's original MS.; that his MS. was afterwards revised and slightly altered by the author himself, and that before the first Folio was printed from it, it had been tampered with by another hand. 2 Charles Knight, however, in his edition of the play in 1875, offered a somewhat different theory: From whatever secondary source it [the quarto] proceeded, there can be no doubt that it was printed from a genuine copy of the great poet. The slight variations between the text of the quarto and of the folio . . . sufficiently show that the original was most accurately printed. The alterations of the folio are not corrections of errors in the original, but, for the most part, slight changes in expression. We have no doubt that each text was printed from a different but genuine copy. 3 The only detailed study of the 1609 quarto in the nineteenth century was made by H. P. Stokes and appeared in his introduction of the Griggs facsimile of the quarto. 4 He pointed out that "The Folio is careful to give a separate line to the commencement of each speech ; indeed this fondness for fresh lines is so great that if Q. by mistake has a new paragraph, F. is sure to 'say ditto'." 5 But he then adds: "This [the stage directions] seems to suggest that the 'Troilus and Cressida' as it appears in the 1st Folio, was printed from the Theater copy." 6 Appleton Morgan, in his preface to the Bankside edition of the play, wrote: "The variants in the quarto and folio texts (so carefully listed by Mr. Stokes) seem to me all chargeable to typographical sources . . . the later printer might easily have been responsible for them all." 7 Nine years later, Sidney Lee stated that the editors of the folio "evinced distrust of the quarto by printing their text from a different copy." 8 And in 1909, A. W. Pollard concluded that the quarto had not been used in the printing of the folio. 9 Pollard's view, supported by J. Q. Adams, 10 seems to have prevailed for the next twenty years, for in the Yale edition, N. Burton Paradise states, "It is now believed that the Folio was printed from a manuscript belonging to the theater and the Quarto from a copy made for the private use of some friend of the actors." 11 The first important work on Troilus and Cressida after Pollard was Peter Alexander's study of the quarto in 1928. 12 In this article, Alexander differs with Pollard and comes to the conclusion that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto that had been corrected from a manuscript in the possession of Hemming and Condell. 13 In the same year (1928), W. W. Greg had stated in a lecture before the British Academy that the folio text of Troilus and Cressida was printed "not from the previous quarto text, but from an independent manuscript representing substantially the same version." 14 Two years after Alexander's article, E. K. Chambers wrote that he was "inclined to think that F was set up from a copy of Q, not so much because of a few misreadings and abnormal spellings [Chambers must here refer to Alexander's article] which they have in common, since these might be derived from a common original, as because of a traceable resemblance in typography and the like." 15 In an attempt to refute the views of Alexander and Chambers, Dr. S. A. Tannenbaum published an extended textual study of Troilus and Cressida in 1934. 16 Dr. Tannenbaum explained the similarities between Q and F (many of which he lists) by assuming that these were found in two manuscripts from which Q and F were independently printed, and, having listed certain corruptions in the F text, concludes: Such absurdities serve to establish the facts that F was not printed from Q, was set up from a manuscript which was difficult to read (or that the copyist could not decipher his original), that the copies for Q [ sic ] were prepared by different scribes, and that the F text, though better than Q's, is not careful and was not authorized. 17 Reversing the opinion expressed in his British Academy lecture, W. W. Greg in 1939 came to support Alexander's view: "F appears to have actually been set up from a corrected copy of Q. I think there can be no doubt of this. Besides common errors and unusual spellings there are several points where the arrangement of F can only be explained by peculiarities in Q that the latter is unlikely to have taken over from its copy." 18 That the textual relationship of Q and F remains obscure is shown by the remarks of two recent editors of the play. G. L. Kittredge, in 1936, wrote: "The relation between the text of the Quarto and that of the Folio is not clear, but the differences are unimportant." 19 And G. B. Harrison, the most recent editor of the play, states: "The quarto issued in 1609 is fairly well printed, but differs in many small points from the text printed in the folio. Each version contains short passages omitted by the other. From certain similarities in the setting of the two texts, it seems either that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto carefully but not uniformly corrected from a playhouse copy, or that both texts derive from a common original." 20 Although it is evident that since Alexander's article in 1928, the trend has, in general, been away from the view of Clark, Wright, Pollard, and Adams, the foregoing survey shows that there is still uncertainty about the relationship of Q and F. Until this relationship is settled, study of the text of Troilus and Cressida must rest on doubtful grounds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The problem of determining that one edition served as copy for a second edition has interested bibliographers for some time. R. B. McKerrow discusses the bibliographical evidence that can be used to determine the relationship of editions, his general conclusion being that the best proof of the relationship of two editions is the demonstration that the second edition reproduces abnormalities that had their origin in the shop where the first edition was printed: . . . whenever he [the editor] comes across anything abnormal in the typographical arrangement of a text, it will generally pay him to consider whether this may be due to the blind following of an earlier edition. 21 Although no single piece of evidence that I shall now present can, in itself, be taken as indisputable proof that F was printed from a copy of Q, the cumulative effect of this evidence cannot, I think, be questioned: for this evidence demonstrates that F reproduces peculiarities found in Q that had their origin in George Eld's printing shop. Previous investigators have noted certain of the similarities between Q and F. As these similarities apparently have not been sufficient to clinch the relationship of Q and F, I shall confine myself to kinds of evidence that have not, for the most part, been previously considered. 22 This evidence will be drawn from (1) the use of roman and italic type, (2) speech-heading forms, and (3) significant spellings. Italic and Roman Type: The fact that F agrees with Q in the use of italic or roman type when its use is dictated by the typographical conventions followed in each cannot, of course, be considered as evidence of their relationship; but when aberrancies in Q are reproduced in F, this agreement becomes significant. It is the normal practice in both Q and F to use italic type for proper names, both in the text and in the stage-directions. Exceptions to this general practice occur, in Q, and it is significant that F then reproduces the roman type used in Q: 23 Stage-direction preceding II.iii.1: Q: Enter Thersites solus . F: Enter Thersites solus . Stage-direction preceding III.iii.38: Q: Achilles and Patro stand in their tent . F: Enter Achilles and Patroclus in their tent . Proper names from mythology are, like the names of characters, generally in italic type in both Q and F. The following significant exceptions occur, with F reproducing the roman font employed in Q: I.iii.89 Q: Sol F: Sol V.ii.174 Q: Neptunes F: Neptunes Although 'Trojan' is never italicized in Q (and only three times in F), 'Myrmidon' is (with one exception) italicized in both, whereas 'Phrigian' is never italicized in either Q or F: I.iii.378 Q: Myrmidon F: Myrmidon V.v.33 Q: Myrmidons F: Myrmidons V.vi.1 Q: Myrmidons F: Myrmidons V.viii.13 Q: Myrmidons F: Myrmidons IV.v.186 Q: Phrigian F: Phrygian IV.v.224 Q: Phrigian F: Phrygian V.x.24 Q: Phrigian F: Phrygian 'Troy,' a word that occurs fifty-two times in this play, is normally in roman type in both Q and F. The following exceptions occur, with F each time reproducing the aberrant italics of Q: III.i.149 Q: Troy F: Troy III.ii.193 Q: Troy F: Troy III.iii.141 Q: Troy F: Troy The following agreement in the typographical treatment of geographic names is significant: I.i.103 Q: India F: India I.ii.80 Q: India F: India I.iii.328 Q: libia F: Lybia V.iv.20 Q: Stix F: Stix And finally, F's repetition of Q's aberrant use of italics for the word 'Autumne' at I.ii.138 is significant, especially as elsewhere in F this word is invariably in roman type. Speech-headings: In the pre-1640 dramatic manuscripts that have survived, there is little consistency in the treatment of speech-headings save that they were written in the left margin of the page. In the manuscript of John of Kent , speech-headings are invariably written out in full, and generally so in Believe as Ye List and Ironsides ; in other plays they are more often abbreviated. 24 W. W. Greg, describing extant dramatic manuscripts, says: "Speakers' names are usually abbreviated, but the practice varies: Massinger tends to write them in full, while on some pages of Thomas of Woodstock they are reduced to an initial. A scribe would often write a page of text first and add the speakers' names later: this tended to produce bad alinement, but ambiguity was generally avoided by the practice of drawing short lines on the left separating the speeches." 25 In the three pages of the Sir Thomas More manuscript written by Hand D, the thirteen speech-headings for the character Lincoln appear as follows: Lincolne, Linco, Linc, Lin, Lin, Lin, Linc, Linc, Linc, Linc, Lincolne, Lincolne, and Lincoln. I do not think the question has ever been specifically studied, but it is my impression that compositors attempted, consciously or unconsciously, to normalize speech-headings. If the speech-headings in his copy were abbreviated fairly uniformly, the compositor would presumably follow his copy. If, however, the speech-headings were written out in full, or if they varied radically, the compositor would probably establish a norm abbreviation of his own, at least for the most frequently appearing speech-headings. 26 An analysis of the speech-heading forms in Troilus and Cressida shows a tendency to normalize the abbreviations. In speech-headings Troilus' name is generally abbreviated in Q to Troy. , but there are exceptions. Between F1 v and the bottom of F3, the form Troy. appears seventeen times, but on F3 v the three speeches of Troilus are each prefixed with Tro . On H1 we find the normal abbreviation Troy. , but on the following two pages (H1 v and H2) the abbreviation Troyl. is used seven times. On H3 (Troilus does not have a speech on H2 v ) the shift is back to Troy . On K3 v and K4 v we find the normal abbreviation Troy. appearing seven times, but on K4, the form Troyl. appears four times. Similar evidence of shifts at the end of the type-page is supplied by the speech-headings for Pandarus. On A4 v , for example, we find the form Pand. used nine times, and the catch-word is Pand. ; but on B1 there is a shift to Pan. , which appears thirteen times. Similarly, the speech-headings for Hector are abbreviated Hect. for his four speeches on L1 v , but on L2 the shorter form Hec. is used four times. On G3 v the speech-heading for Thersites appears as Thersi. (five times); but on the following page (G4) the form Thers. appears eleven times. Other evidence of a similar nature can be drawn from the speech-headings of other characters. It will be noted that the shift in these speech-heading forms coincides with the end of the type-page. Now unless we are willing to believe that similar shifts occurred in the MS from which Q was set and that these shifts each time happened to coincide with the end of a type-page of Q, we must accept the fact that these shifts in speech-heading forms represent the tendency to normalize by the compositors of Q. 27 In other words, the speech-headings in Q cannot all represent manuscript readings; for if we suppose that the Q forms reproduce manuscript readings, we must assume against all reason that these shifts in the manuscript coincided with the arbitrary (37 lines to a page) page division of Q. Such a hypothesis, involving such a chain of coincidences, seems to me to be untenable. Analysis of the speech-headings in F affords additional evidence that F was set from Q. We have seen that the variations in the forms of certain speech-headings in Q cannot represent readings found in the manuscript from which it was set. If, therefore, we find the compositors 28 of F reproducing these variations, we shall have proof that F was set from Q. Although the folio compositors normalized speech-headings somewhat more uniformly than did the quarto compositors, there remains sufficient evidence to establish the relationship of the two texts. In the quarto, the speech-headings for Pandarus are normally abbreviated to either Pan. or Pand . Both of the folio compositors generally normalize these speech-headings to Pan . The following significant exceptions occur, with F reproducing the longer form found in Q: I.ii.129 Q: Pand. F: Pand. III.i.110 Q: Pand. F: Pand. III.ii.204 Q: Pand. F: Pand. IV.ii.23 Q: Pand. F: Pand. V.iii.97 Q: Pand. F: Pand. V.iii.99 Q: Pand. F: Pand. V.iii.101 Q: Pand. F: Pand. The speech-headings for Diomedes offer additional evidence that F was set from Q. The speech-heading appears fifty-six times in F, forty-six times as Dio. , and ten times as Diom . Eight of the ten cases in which the longer form is used in F reproduce the form found in Q. There is some confusion in the text of Q as to the spelling of Calchas: it appears as Calcas and Chalcas. The 'h' spelling is used in one Q speech-heading (V.ii.1), and F significantly reproduces the Q form Chal . It is not the practice in either Q or F to give names in full in the speech-headings, even for the first appearance of a character or at the beginning of a new scene. In the following cases, when the name is given in full in Q it is likewise given in full in F: I.iii.31 Q: Nestor . F: Priam . II.ii.97 Q: Priam . F: Priam . III.i.61 Q: Paris . F: Paris . V.iii.62 Q: Priam . F: Priam . V.iii.71 Q: Priam . F: Priam . V.iii.94 Q: Priam . F: Priam . In Q the Speech-heading for Ajax is sometines written out in full. In F it is usually abbreviated Aia . F uses the longer form ten times, in each case reproducing the full form found in Q. And finally, the absence of a speech-heading in Q and F alike at II.iii.1 suggests that F was printed from Q. In Q, the first line on D4 v is the centered stage-direction, Enter Thersites solus . His speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following line. In F, the stage direction Enter Thersites solus is centered and the speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following line. Spellings: The fact that F reproduces a given spelling in Q cannot be considered evidence of the dependence of F upon Q. Such a single spelling, particularly if it were unusual, might represent a manuscript spelling independently reproduced in the two texts. 29 But if F is independent of Q, we should not find F reproducing indiscriminate spelling variants found in Q; nor should we find F reproducing the characteristic spellings of the two compositors of Q. In two groups of words, F reproduces these indiscriminate variations; and in a third group, F reproduces the characteristic spelling of the two Q compositors. The use of final ie for y in polysyllables is not a characteristic spelling of the compositors of either Q or F. Seventy-two such spellings, however, are found in Q; the compositors of F reproduce forty-six of these spellings. The explanation of these F spellings must be that the F compositors were influenced by their copy to depart from their normal spelling habits. 30 In Q, the exclamation 'Oh' is spelled indiscriminately 'O' and 'Oh.' In F, it is, with twenty-one exceptions, spelled 'O.' 31 Only seven times when Q has 'Oh' does F not reproduce the form; and only once does F use 'Oh' when the corresponding Q spelling is 'O.' Compositors A and B of the folio occasionally depart from their normal spelling habits. Compositor B, who normally spells do and go without a final e , five times spells these words with a final e . And Compositor A, who normally uses a final e , thirteen times spells these words without the characteristic final e . These exceptions to the characteristic spelling practices of the two F compositors furnish the most striking evidence of the relationship of Q and F. Seventeen of these eighteen exceptions reproduce spellings found in Q, and these Q spellings are characteristic spellings of the quarto compositors X and Y. In the following cases, we find the folio compositors reproducing significant Q spellings that are the peculiar spellings of compositors X and Y and cannot therefore all have existed in any manuscript. I.i.119 Q: goe F: goe II.iii.169 Q: do F: do I.iii.308 Q: goe F: goe III.iii.90 Q: do F: do II.i.97 Q: goe F: goe IV.i.27 Q: doo 32 F: doo II.ii.112 Q: goe F: goe IV.ii.28 Q: do F: do III.ii.56 Q: go F: go IV.ii.28 Q: do F: do III.ii.56 Q: go F: go V.i.30 Q: do F: do III.ii.62 Q: go F: go I.i.42 Q: go F: go III.ii.204 Q: go F: go III.i.73 Q: go F: go IV.ii.25 Q: go F: go</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The evidence presented here, supported by the evidence that previous investigators have brought to light, demonstrates, I hope, that F was indeed set up from a copy of Q. The implications of this fact may now be briefly considered. We can, first of all, define the authority of the two extant early printed editions of the play. W. W. Greg writes: "In seeking to determine which is the most authoritative edition, an editor should distinguish between 'substantive' editions, namely those not derived as to essential character from any other extant edition, and 'derivative' editions, namely those derived, whether immediately or not and with or without minor intentional modification, from some other extant edition. It may be taken that the most authoritative edition will be a substantive one, but the distinction is in practice sometimes difficult to draw, so that this has less significance than at first appears." 33 The 1609 quarto of Troilus and Cressida is a 'substantive' edition, and the 1623 folio text of Troilus and Cressida is a 'derivative' edition. But it is demonstrable that F is not wholly a derivative edition, for it has some thirty various lines that are not found in Q. 34 These lines are all clearly genuine and have been accepted as such by all editors. Since these lines were not in Q, from which F was set, they must have been supplied from some outside source, i.e. a manuscript. 35 This manuscript supplied not only the lines wanting in Q but also almost certainly some of the substantive variant readings found in F. 36 The folio text of Troilus and Cressida must therefore be defined as a derivative edition containing some substantive readings emanating from an independent source. But defining the authority of Q and F solves only the first of a series of problems confronting the editor of the play. He must next investigate the origin and nature of the manuscript behind the substantive readings in F, as well as the origin and nature of the manuscript from which Q was set; he should, however, make Q—the only substantive edition of the play—the copy-text for his edition. The use of F's variant readings, except to repair obvious corruption in Q, would be dependent on the editor's estimate of the nature and authority of the manuscript from which they come. 37</field>

For convenience, line references in this article are to the Griggs facsimile, which follows the Globe edition. 5 Stokes, op. cit. , p. vii, n. 1. 6 Ibid.

Mr. Alexander, as we shall see, is correct in believing that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto, but as E. K. Chambers implies (see below), he does not refute the possibility that these seventeen readings existed in the original manuscript or manuscripts from which the quarto and folio were independently printed. 14 "Principles of Emendation in Shakespeare," Proceedings of the British Academy , XIV (1928), 153. Alexander ( op. cit. , p. 269, n. 2) says, "Dr. Greg this year in his Shakespeare Lecture to the British Academy has anticipated the conclusion here come to about the relation of the Quarto to Folio," but I can find no evidence to support this statement. Greg later (see below) supports Alexander's view, but in the lecture before the British Academy he clearly stated that the folio was not printed from the quarto. 15 William Shakespeare (1930), I, 440. An unfortunately worded sentence on the following page (441) has led at least one investigator (Dr. Tannenbaum, see below) to the erroneous conclusion that Chambers contradicts himself, saying first that F was printed from Q and later that F was printed from the author's original manuscript. The sentence reads, "If I am right as to iv.5.96, the manuscript used for F was probably the author's original, and the variations between Q and F are intelligible on the assumption that this was so and that Q was printed from a transcript, perhaps for a private owner." By the phrase "the manuscript used for F" Chambers means, of course, the manuscript used for correcting a copy of Q from which F was then printed. 16 "A Critique of the Text of Troilus and Cressida ," The Shakespeare Association Bulletin , IX (1934), 55-74, 125-44, 198-214. 17 Tannenbaum, op. cit. , p. 207. 18 The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , p. 111. In his A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , also published in 1939, Greg states (p. 414): "The text printed in this [the folio] and subsequent editions contains some lines not in that previously published, and clearly made use of an independent source, but whether it was actually printed from manuscript or from a corrected copy of ( a ) [the quarto] is not certain." 19 The Complete Works of Shakespeare , ed. by G.

Harrison (1948), p. 656. 21 An Introduction to Bibliography (1927), pp. 184-89. 22 In my unpublished doctoral dissertation The 1609 Quarto of Troilus and Cressida and Its Relation to the Folio Text of 1623 (The University of Virginia, 1949), the evidence of the relationship of Q and F is presented in somewhat greater detail, and certain kinds of evidence, notably lining practices, are included which cannot be presented here. In addition to its bearing on the present problem, I hope that the evidence here presented will suggest techniques that can successfully be applied to other problems of a similar nature. 23 An examination of the comedy section of the folio reveals only eight other stage-directions in which roman type is used for names of characters: The Tempest (A5, B2 v ), Two Gentlemen (C2, C2 v ), and The Merry Wives (D2, D4, D5). It seems probable that these exceptions (like the two from Troilus and Cressida noted below) can be explained only by assuming that the compositor followed his copy in spite of the typographical conventions of the folio. 24 Chambers, William Shakespeare , I, 113. 25 Greg, The Editorial Problem , p. 34. 26 This can be demonstrated in at least one other dramatic quarto that I have studied. In The Puritaine , printed by Eld in 1607, the name of the character George Pye-board is variously spelled in the text: Pie-board, Pye-boord, Pi-Board, and Pyboard. Two compositors, working in relay, set the text of The Puritaine : one normalized the speech-heading to Pi(y)e. , whereas the other used the abbreviation Pi(y)b . The speech-headings in Sir John Oldcastle (1600), at present being investigated, seem to exhibit similar variations. 27 Spelling tests, supported by the evidence of measures and certain typographical peculiarities, indicate that two compositors were employed in setting the Q text of Troilus and Cressida . I designate them X and Y to distinguish them from the two folio compositors, A and B. See below. The compositors of Q and F, and their work, is to be the subject of another paper. 28 Like Q, F was set by two compositors, A and B. For their identification and an analysis of their work, see E. E. Willoughby, The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1932), pp. 57-58. 29 See Chambers, William Shakespeare , I, 440-41. 30 Certain of these ie spellings are particularly significant. At I.i.174, the word 'fiftie' is the last word of the line in Q. The spelling with the final ie was probably adopted as a means of justifying the line. In F the word is the first word of the line and does not therefore represent a spelling adopted to justify the line. At II.iii.113, Q's spelling 'courtesie' is reproduced by F, and at IV.v.82 and V.v.15, Q's variant spelling 'curtesie' is likewise reproduced by F. 31 The spelling 'O' seems to be the normal form used throughout F. In Julius Caesar , a play set by the same two folio compositors (A and B) who set Troilus and Cressida , the exclamation occurs ninety times, each time as 'O'. 32 This spelling is particularly significant, representing as it does a unique spelling in Q and F. The final o instead of the expected final e in Q may represent foul case. 33 The Editorial Problem , p. xiii. Greg's definition may be compared with that of the late R. B. McKerrow: "Consideration of the various early printed texts . . . will show us that in the case of any play there is at least one edition which cannot have been derived from any other edition now extant . . . and that others of these texts are derived, with or without intentional modification, from earlier extant editions. Let us call the texts of the first group 'substantive' texts; those of the second 'derived' texts. It is evident that 'the most authoritative text' of which we are in search must be a 'substantive' one." Prologomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939), p. 8. 34 These lines are listed by Stokes, op. cit. , p. vii. 35 That Shakespeare, as an afterthought, added these lines to a copy of Q need not seriously be considered. Most, if not all, of them are to be explained as omissions due to the carelessness of the Q compositors. 36 Greg, op. cit. , p. xiii, distinguishes between 'essential readings' and 'accidents of spelling and punctuation.' In "The Rationale of Copy-Text" in this present volume he defines these categories more precisely, using the terms 'accidentals' and 'substantive readings.' 37 The present writer is engaged in a study of the variant readings and hopes to publish in the future a systematic survey of the evidence.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Mark III: New Light on the Proof-Reading for the First Folio of Shakespeare by CHARLTON HINMAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN 1932 DR. E. E. WILLOUGHBY PUBLISHED, IN A now classic monograph, a reproduction and a brief discussion of the sole example of corrected proof for the First Folio of Shakespeare then known. 1 The present writer described a second example in an article published in 1942. 2 It is now possible to present a third example; 3 and an analysis of this, particularly in the light of evidence furnished by the other two, raises a number of questions about stop-press correction that may be of interest—and that seem to point to the soundness of certain conjectures that could heretofore be made only with great diffidence. Not that complete confidence is now possible: the new evidence is slight and rather slippery—but all the more interesting, perhaps, for this very reason. The first of our three concrete examples of First-Folio proof-reading occurs in an isolated leaf upon which are printed two pages of Anthony and Cleopatra . One side of this leaf shows the uncorrected state of page 352 (xx6 v ) of the First Folio text. This page is clearly marked with a proof-reader's corrections, and these corrections, and these only, are the ones embraced in the text presented by most of the surviving copies of the book. Quite probably, as is strongly suggested by both our other examples, this single leaf was once a part of a complete First Folio. Otherwise its chances of survival would have been extremely poor; and it is known to have been discovered in the 19th century "in a parcel of fragments of the First Folio" 4 (which seems more likely to mean in a group of leaves from a First Folio than, for instance, in a bundle of printer's waste from Jaggard's shop). In any event the surviving leaf is certainly only a part of what once was a full sheet. But what the other leaf of the sheet looked like—whether or not page 341 (XXI r ), the conjugate forme-page of page 352 (XX6 v ), also contained a proof-reader's corrections—this, unfortunately, we cannot say. The question, however, is not so idle as it may at first seem, for it is basically a question about proofing methods, methods of which we would gladly know much more than we do, and about which our other examples appear to have something to teach us. The proof-sheet first fully described in 1942 is to be found in the Jonas copy of the First Folio, No. 47 in the Folger collection. Forme VV3 r :4 v (pages 333 and 336, in Othello ) is in the uncorrected state. Page 333 shows, in what is apparently the same hand and the same ink as the marks in the Anthony and Cleopatra page, the proof-reader's marks that resulted in the corrected state of this page. The conjugate forme-page 336, however, is unmarked . Another First Folio in the Folger collection (No. 48, once the W. T. Spencer copy) provides our new evidence, this time in a section of the book involving two further tragedies, Hamlet and King Lear . Page 281 (qq1 r , in Hamlet ) presents a special problem, to be considered later in this paper. Let us first look at the conjugate forme-page 292 (qq6 v , in Lear ). Here, in what seem again the same hand and ink as before, 5 a third set 6 of proof-reader's corrections appears. (See Plate I.) The changes called for are not numerous—only five in all. These changes were all made, and must have been made, indeed, before any large number of uncorrected states had been printed off: 76 of the 82 copies examined (or about 92.7%) show the corrected state of this page (as in Plate II); only 6, including the copy with the proof-reader's marks, (or about 7.3%) were printed before correction was effected. The variant pairs are given below. (Positions are identified as to column within the page and line number within the column. The additional references in parentheses are to act, scene, and line in the Globe edition of King Lear . The uncorrected readings, which can easily be examined further in the Lee facsimile, where no proof-reader's cancellations obscure them, are given first.) 1. a 21 (II, ii, 52-3) liues, he dies that▊ſtrikes liues, he dies that ſtrikes 2. a 46 (II, ii, 80) holly cords atwaine holy cords▎ atwaine 3. b 6 (II, ii, 104) Narure Nature 4. b 31 (II, ii, 129) Jubdued ſubdued 5. b 46 (II, ii, 141) ſi ttill ſit till It may be noted of these variants that the earlier state is in every case wrong, but that correction in no case implies reference to copy. The errors are all patently compositorial, with the possible but improbable exception of "holly" for "holy" in a 46. Neither word appears in the quarto text and one or the other must rest on the authority of some manuscript. 7 But even if the earlier Folio reading accurately reproduces the copy for the Folio print, both the error and the correct reading are sufficiently obvious to be recognized by the proof-reader independently of any other "authority." We may also observe of this variant that the correction was not faultlessly effected, since the space-quad added after "cords" to compensate for the lost "l" was not properly pushed down and so took ink. There is, perhaps, nothing very surprising in the fact that the correction of a 21 not merely removed the faulty setting after "that", the only thing in the line that was marked by the reader, but also resulted in improved spacing before "he": the wider spacing here is an evident consequence of reducing the space between "that" and "strikes". Yet it is clear that the correction called for could more easily have been made otherwise, without disturbing so much type, and that the compositor who effected the required change was interested in producing generally well-spaced lines when possible; that, in short, some attention was paid to typographical refinement. And this is also shown by 2 (despite the inking space-quad) and by 5, though in this instance it is the proof-reader rather than the compositor who is responsible for a minor improvement—an improvement remarkable for its very triviality. Between this kind of thing and a serious and sustained concern for textual accuracy, however, there remains a very wide gulf. 8 Page 281 (qq1 r , the conjugate forme-page of 292) presents a special problem because it obliges us to define variant somewhat more narrowly than heretofore. A collation of 80 copies of this page reveals no variants in the sense either of verbal differences or of differences in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or the like. Yet the page seems nevertheless to have been proof-read; for a minor typographical imperfection, although of a kind to which we ordinarily have paid very scant heed, appears to have been corrected in it, and corrected at the same time as the five small errors in page 292 listed above. The facts are these. In b 33 on page 281 (corresponding to V, ii, 358, in the Globe Hamlet ) the last two letters of "thee" for some reason stood so high in the original setting that, whereas these two letters seem very heavily inked in the printed page, the "h" seems lightly inked and the right-hand part of it is barely perceptible (see Plate III—or the Lee facsimile). The word so appears in all 6 of the copies which show the uncorrected state of page 292. In all but one of the 74 others which show corrected page 292 all four letters of the "thee" in page 281 are uniformly inked (see Plate IV for a random example). The one exception is provided by Folger copy No. 40, which shows the corrected state of page 292 but the ill-printed "thee" in page 281. This, however, is surely the exception that proves the rule. For close examination demonstrates that the two leaves in question are not in this copy conjugate , as is perhaps most readily shown by the fact that both qq1 and qq6 here bear a watermark: Folger No. 40 is clearly a "made-up" First Folio. The absolute constancy of the relationship between the two settings of "thee" in page 281 and the two patently variant states of the text in page 292 clearly indicates that the changes in both pages came about at the same time, after the single unlocking for correction to which we know the forme was subject; and if all of these changes were intentional, it follows inevitably that page 281, no less than page 292, presents us with truly variant states that are the result of proof-reading. For we must certainly accept the principle that whenever a text is deliberately changed in the course of its transmission, genuine, if not always "substantive," variants are produced. "But how," it may be objected, "can we know that the change in page 281 was intentional? Obviously enough the crucial issue is not the relative triviality of the difference between two supposed 'states' but whether human volition can properly be adduced to account for this difference; and what is there to make us suppose direct human agency here responsible?" Unhappily, page 281 does not show any sign of the proof-reader's mark that would resolve this difficulty. The suggestion presents itself, moreover, that the two insufficiently pushed-down types in page 281 b 33 might just possibly have assumed their proper places, as it were by accident, when the forme was loosened by the unlocking required for the correction of the errors in page 292. Such an explanation, however, will hardly do. It is initially unsatisfactory, especially in the light of the extreme unevenness of the "thee" in the 6 copies here considered uncorrected. Are such completely even impressions as we find in the 73 corrected copies likely to be the accidental result of work on the other page of the forme? How are we then to explain, if even impressions are thus easily and unintentionally produced, the unevenness in the stage direction " Enter Osricke ." a few lines farther along in page 281? Here the " c " was somewhat high in the original setting, so that the preceding " i " inked poorly; and approximately the same unevenness appears to be characteristic of all copies. And the same thing is true of the "cracke a Noble heart" about ten lines below, where the consecutive letters "e a N" were a little high and therefore seem overinked, though in slightly different degree—in all copies. Only in b 33, then, does unevenness give way to perfect regularity of impression. The difference is fairly extreme and the change occurred, not gradually, but at once; and it occurred at a time when five other small changes were introduced elsewhere in the forme, demonstrably as a result of proof-reading. The change in question is not likely to have been accidental, as other evidence from nearby lines indicates. Deliberate alteration as a result of proof-reading seems the only reasonable explanation. 9 If then we are obliged to assume that page 281 was proof-read, why does it not show, like its conjugate forme-page, the proof-reader's marks? Probably for the very simple reason that the proof-reader, unlike the pressmen, considered the single page, rather than the two-page forme, his basic working unit. The peculiarities of another pair of conjugate forme-pages, 333 and 336, in Othello , will perhaps now be recalled. Both pages exist in two clearly distinguished states, although only a single correction was made in page 336; and the corrected and uncorrected states of the one page are invariably found paired with the corresponding states of the other. In the Jonas copy, moreover, page 333 carries the proof-reader's corrections; but page 336 is unmarked . "The most satisfactory explanation of these facts," it was suggested in 1942, "seems to be that the proof-reader handed his corrections to the compositor as soon as he had read one page of an impression taken from the forme for proofing purposes, and then used another impression as proof for the second page. Such a procedure is entirely plausible, since it would obviously save considerable time. (It is also possible, of course, that an impression from the uncorrected forme was given to each of two proof-readers and that one read p. 333 while the other was reading p. 336. This method would also save valuable time; but there is no need to postulate an additional workman.) We are doubly unfortunate, therefore, in that the Anthony proof-sheet is fragmentary. Since it represents only half of a two-page forme . . . it can provide us with no further basis for conjecture as to how commonly the method that seems to have been used in the proofing of VV4 v :3 r was employed elsewhere during the printing of the Folio." 10 Now, however, we have new evidence. For in pages 281 and 292 of the Spencer copy we appear to find precisely the same peculiarities as in pages 333 and 336 of the Jonas copy. And hence we may conclude that, at least some of the time and when dealing with that portion of the First Folio that includes Hamlet, Lear, Othello , and (probably) Anthony and Cleopatra , the proof-reader returned a sheet after correcting only one of its pages. Presumably —for only thus would such a practice effect real gains—he then proceeded to correct the other page in another copy of the full sheet. The required alterations could by this means be begun sooner than otherwise; and by the time these changes had been made in the first type-page the reader would be able to return his second proof-page, suitably marked for immediate correction. Whether or not this practice was the usual one throughout the printing of the First Folio, and perhaps of a great many other books of the period as well, we still cannot say with assurance; but certain suggestions present themselves. Probably it would not be an efficient method whenever large numbers of errors were likely to be encountered (so that the second proof-page might not be marked and ready as soon as required); nor is it a method that would ever be employed when the reader contemplated a careful comparison of proof-page and copy, since really conscientious proofing of this kind would certainly require much more time than a rapid reading of which the primary intent was merely the elimination of obvious typographical error. 11 The implications of this last consideration are obviously of some moment; and although the subject cannot here be farther pursued, at least one of these implications may be mentioned. If the stop-press variants in the First Folio, which we now have good reason to believe very abundant, were ordinarily the product of a method which itself precluded correction by reference to copy, it follows that we should be particularly interested in the readings of the various formes that make up the volume before these were subjected to a process of arbitrary sophistication. Many of the First Folio's variants will no doubt be found to involve only the "accidentals" of which Dr. Greg speaks elsewhere in the present volume and to which less interest usually attaches than to "substantives." But substantives too there will unquestionably be; and a careful attention to the un corrected members of variant substantive pairs may sometimes enable us to get closer to what Shakespeare himself wrote than the corrected readings that are but the swift guesses of a printing-house reader who seems to have been more concerned with the appearance than with the accuracy of the Folio text. It is still, of course, imprudent to generalize too widely about the press-correction method, or methods, employed during the printing of the First Folio; but all of the evidence so far available certainly indicates the customary use of the none-too-rigorous method described above. The examination of forme qq1 r :6 v throughout the entire Folger collection of First Folios brings to light one further and rather surprising fact that may also, finally, be recorded here. In addition to Folger No. 48, the copy which carries the proof-reader's mark on page 292, the copies showing the uncorrected state of the forme are Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee facsimile reveals that the Chatsworth-Devonshire copy is also uncorrected in this forme. (Folger No. 40, clearly a "made up" copy in which the two leaves in question are not conjugate, is uncorrected in page 292 only.) And now let us once more recall forme VV3 r :4 v in Othello . The uncorrected state of this forme is found in Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee facsimile also shows the uncorrected state. In short, except that qq1 r :6 v is also uncorrected in No. 48 and in one page of made-up No. 40, the very same copies and no others are uncorrected in two different formes—and in two formes, one involving Hamlet and Lear , the other Othello , that cannot have been dealt with consecutively in Jaggard's printing-house. Clearly there must have been a more systematic method of separating the sheep from the goats, and of keeping the two breeds apart, than we have sometimes supposed. 12</field>

I am deeply indebted to the director and staff of this great library for innumerable kindnesses, including permission to publish the reproductions that accompany this paper. 4 Willoughby, op. cit. , p. 63. 5 As Drs. Willoughby, McManaway, and Dawson all agree after independent examinations of the pages in question; but the evidence, as these experts also agree, remains too scanty for really positive identification. 6 Third, of course, only in order of discovery. The three sets came into being in just the reverse order: the present set (page 292), the Othello set (page 333), then the Anthony set (page 352). 7 See "The Copy for F," pp. 7-18 in George Ian Duthie, Shakespeare's "King Lear" (1949), esp. p. 17. 8 With one notable exception in the Othello proof-page (333), there are no corrections that imply reference to copy in any of the three proof-pages now known. 9 To readers who are not satisfied by this argument I can only offer an appeal to the evidence, as yet unpublished, that gives me my own greatest confidence in the conclusion expressed above. During the summer of 1949 I collated pages 305-40 (18 formes that include the whole of Othello and parts of Lear and of Anthony and Cleopatra ) throughout the entire Folger collection of 79 First Folios. The work was done with mechanical aid made possible by a generous grant from the Old Dominion Foundation. Among the numerous variants that my "machine" turned up was abundant evidence that the proof-reader was constantly at pains to correct minor typographical infelicities—including space-quads taking ink (however slightly) and several uneven impressions. On more than one occasion the press was stopped for the sole purpose of correcting a single badly inking type. 10 Hinman, op. cit. , pp. 103-4. 11 Of some interest in this connection are the statistics presented above: approximately 7.3% uncorrected as against 92.7% corrected states in a total of 82 copies examined. These percentages suggest, for an edition of 1250 copies, a total of about 90 uncorrected states, or probably rather less than half an hour's work by an uninterrupted press. To remove a forme from the press, to unlock it and correct one of its type-pages, would presumably take only about the same time, at most. But even if it took slightly longer, it would surely not take so much time as would be required for a proof-reader to make a thoroughgoing collation of a proof-page with its copy. 12 It will be interesting in this connection to learn (I do not myself yet know) which copies contain the uncorrected state of XXI r :6 v in Anthony and Cleopatra . Familiarity with other variant formes among the Folger First Folios makes me bold to declare, however, that we cannot ordinarily expect any such strict correspondence as the one just noted.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Newcomb: A Restoration Printer's Ornament Stock by C. WILLIAM MILLER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MANY EXTANT AND READILY ACCESSIBLE books signed by the printer Thomas Newcomb afford a particularly good starting point in the large and tantalizingly complicated study of printers' ornaments in the Commonwealth and Post-Restoration periods. Newcomb was active as a printer for thirty-three years: he was the master of a large printing shop, and after the great fire became one of a handful of men who dominated London printing. Newcomb owned and employed a large assortment of ornaments which have a history of use totaling approximately fifty years, if one counts that group in use ten years before Newcomb acquired it and those which Newcomb's son used for at least seven years after his father's death. Finally, Newcomb printed well over a thousand items, a large number of them for the patentees of the King's Printing Office, but an even greater number for more than a score of stationers, including Henry Herringman, the foremost publisher of belles lettres in Post-Restoration London. Hence, one finds few prominent writers of history, science, theology, or literature in the last half of the century who had not had one or more compositions run off Newcomb's presses. Obviously a definitive study of the many ornaments in Newcomb's thousand or more publications must await first the appearance of Mr. Wing's Short-Title Catalogue . . . 1641-1700 , Volume III, and then the labors of other students. In this paper I attempt only to summarize the history of transmission of ornaments owned by Newcomb, to set down my observations on how ornaments were used in Newcomb-printed books, to offer some suggestions to those obliged to work with Newcomb ornaments, and, finally, to introduce bibliographers to what I believe is a fair sampling of Newcomb ornaments, factotums, and decorative initials, with an accompanying list of their occurrences. The history of a portion of the ornaments used by Newcomb begins in 1638 1 with the emergence of John Raworth as a London printer. I have examined far fewer of his publications than those of Newcomb, but my impression is that his ornament stock was a good-sized one. He owned a wide variety of decorative initials and many large, generally attractive ornaments; he preferred initials to factotums, and used both the initials and ornaments generously, especially in folios. The clearness and completeness of impression which many of his ornaments make would suggest that the bulk of his stock was newly purchased rather than bought up from some other printer. This observation is of course only conjectural. I have not tried to trace Raworth's ornaments in the books of earlier printers. 2 Raworth's career as a printer was cut short by his death late in July of 1646. The uninterrupted flow of religious pamphlets from the Raworth presses indicates, however, that John's widow, Ruth, assumed charge of operations at once. Her activity as a printer extends to 1648 when she married Thomas Newcomb, who had just become free of the Stationers' Company after serving a seven years' apprenticeship under Gregory Dexter. 3 Throughout her brief career Ruth Raworth used the ornaments at hand in her shop, and since the kinds of books she printed made no extraordinary demands on her ornament supply, the likelihood is that she added few or no ornaments to her late husband's collection. Once Newcomb had married Ruth Raworth, he seems to have taken over the direction of her shop, located on Thames Street over against Baynard's Castle, where he remained until September of 1666 when the London fire destroyed his place of business and obliged him to seek new quarters west of the old city in the Savoy. Newcomb used enough Raworth decorations after 1666 for one to determine that Newcomb had saved his ornament collection from the flames, but after his removal to the Savoy he no longer relied on his old stock as he had done in the past. He continued to use the old Raworth ornaments, his compositors overworking a favored few until they were caked with ink and badly worn. But he replaced his Raworth factotums and a number of the old decorative initial sets with new ones, almost always bearing flower designs. These floral decorations Newcomb used with such consistency thereafter that more than any other feature of his presswork they especially characterize the books printed by him during the last thirteen years of his career. The study of Newcomb's decorations falls roughly, therefore, into two divisions: the years 1648 to 1667 when Newcomb used Raworth's stock almost exclusively, and the years 1668 to 1681 when he employed Raworth's collection in combination with his own. Newcomb died suddenly on December 26, 1681, as one ardent conventicleer would have it, struck down by God in the king's presence for hating protestant dissenters. 4 His printing equipment, including his ornaments, and his patent rights in the King's Printing Office were inherited by his only son, Thomas Newcomb, Jr., also free of the Stationers' Company, who remained active as a printer in the Savoy until July, 1688, when Edward Jones moved into the Savoy and took over the printing of the London Gazette . Whether the son ceased printing at this point or set up shop elsewhere and continued actively in his trade is difficult to ascertain. 5 There is no question about the fact that he managed, despite the political upheaval, to maintain the right to publish some types of official documents and that he, his executrix, and his assigns continued exercising those rights well into the eighteenth century. Equally difficult to determine is when Thomas Newcomb, Jr., disposed of his ornaments and to whom he sold them. One of Newcomb's factotums appearing in Dryden's All For Love (1692) printed by Edward Jones suggests that either in 1688 or after Newcomb's death Jones got hold of some of Newcomb's stock. The appearance of two well-known Newcomb ornaments in John Macock's printing of Cowley's Works dated 1688 but advertised in the London Gazette as early as December 15, 1687, poses a problem which further research alone can solve. 6 The evidence pointing to a disturbance in the printing activities of Thomas Newcomb, Jr., about the year 1688 is sufficient, however, to warrant the conclusion that after 1687 one cannot use Newcomb ornaments to identify with certainty the printer of an unsigned book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. From the outset of his career Thomas Newcomb was associated with a comparatively large and well established printing house, which grew even larger as he prospered in his trade. The observations which one formulates, therefore, on how ornaments were used in Newcomb-printed books can only be those reflecting the general policy of his shop, and not a list of typographical idiosyncrasies of the master himself. The practice of Newcomb's compositors in handling book decorations compared with that of the printing houses of several of his contemporaries indicates, however, that Newcomb's practice was in almost every respect typical. During the Interregnum and the early years of the Restoration Newcomb tended, like the other printers of that day, to use more ornaments and initials throughout the text of his octavos and quartos than he did in the late 1660's and 1670's. His folios were generally his most elaborately ornamented volumes, although he seldom decorated them so lavishly as did his predecessor Raworth. From 1667 to 1675 Newcomb used few ornaments in his smaller formats and only a sprinkling of initials and factotums throughout the text. The ornamentation in his play quartos was confined entirely to the initial gatherings: a headpiece and initial or factotum on the recto of the second leaf which was usually reserved for the dedication; a headpiece on the first page of the preface, if one followed; and a headpiece or initial decoration, seldom both, on the first page of the text. After 1675 he used even less ornamentation in his play quartos than he had before that date, reaching a point finally about 1679 when he omitted it altogether. In this omission he was only following the practice of his fellow London printers, many of whom had been turning out ornament-less play quartos since the early 1670's. In attempting to identify the printers of unsigned quarto plays published in 1679 or thereafter for the next thirty years, the bibliographer finds a knowledge of printers' ornaments practically valueless. In the many normal and oversized folios issuing from his presses, one finds Newcomb's most elaborate book decorations. As a rule printers generally tended to pay deference to their folio ornamentation. Newcomb's practice was to use headpieces and initial decorations profusely in the initial gatherings. Thereafter for about two-thirds of the volume he used ornaments and factotums to mark only fresh divisions of text. The final third was often devoid of decoration. Generally Newcomb seemed slightly fonder of using ornamentation after the Restoration than those among his contemporaries whose books I have examined, and was markedly more generous in their use than his important competitor John Macock. Yet one comes upon enough exceptions to most of the generalizations made so far in this section to conclude that the price the publisher was willing to pay and the reading public for which he intended his publication dictate more often than not the amount of paper space the printer took up with decorations. Thus in a period when Newcomb employed ornaments rather consistently, his quarto edition of Nedham's Interest Will Not Lie (1659) and his folio printing of Certain Letters Evidencing The King's Stedfastness in the Protestant Religion (1660) are without ornamentation while in a period of dwindling ornamentation, even in folios, Newcomb's folio edition of The Genealogical History of the Kings of England (1677), privately printed for the herald Francis Sandford, turns out to be perhaps the most attractively and profusely decorated volume of Newcomb's printing career. There are apparently no practices dealing with ornaments that mark distinctively the workmanship of Newcomb's shop, but there are some practices used by the contemporaries of Newcomb which his compositors did not follow. Newcomb did not, for instance, use a printer's device; in fact, he seldom used a title-page ornament, and when he did, he had no favorite. The only ornament appearing more consistently on his title-pages than elsewhere is the emblem bearing the motto: "Premor Dum Attollor," but it occurs only five times on the title-pages of the more than 200 books which I have examined. Except for the early years of his career Newcomb did not use ornaments to mark the conclusion of a division of text, and never, to my knowledge, used a tailpiece although Raworth had in his collection handsome tailpieces which Newcomb must have acquired. Newcomb made no effort to use throughout a volume the decorative initials of one design; his son did so only in the portion of Shakespeare's fourth folio which he printed. Nor did Newcomb greatly concern himself about the nicety of proportion between decoration and format. Sometimes a very small initial meant for a duodecimo is buried on an oversized folio page; at other times, one finds a large factotum designed primarily for a folio appearing on a quarto page. On the other hand, there are a few positive practices worth mentioning. After 1666 Newcomb used factotums far more frequently than he used initials, and he used over and over the same small group of ornaments. He made some effort to decorate books authorized by or dedicated to the king with appropriate national and Stuart ornaments. The only other occasion on which a Newcomb compositor appeared concerned about using a particular ornament in a particular place—and this applies to compositors in other printing houses as well—was when he was working on a reprint of a volume previously issued from his shop. Then he would often reproduce in the new edition the identical ornament used perhaps five or ten years earlier, despite the fact that searching for it in his collection must frequently have involved a considerable waste of time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Simple as the bibliographical technique is of using an ornament chart to identify the unsigned books of a printer, it has occasionally its pitfalls, and hence for the guidance of bibliographers who may in the future make use of the chart of Newcomb book decorations that follows, I append these scattered observations. English ornament makers of this period show a marked tendency to copy and recopy earlier designs rather than create new ones. Those copies made in wood are more often than not distinguishable from each other, but on occasion recuttings were made with such precision that one is hard put to tell them apart. The many decorations made from metal rather than wood present a greater problem in that indistinguishable copies of an ornament cast from the same matrix were owned and regularly used by as many as a half-dozen printers. Wherever I have found a printer using an ornament very similar to Newcomb's, I have made a note of it after the list of occurrences; but since I have concentrated in this study on the ornaments of only a handful of printers and since there are tens of thousands of books which I have not seen, the likelihood is that future study will uncover very similar or indistinguishable copies of Newcomb ornaments in the stock of other printers. Measurements of ornaments are helpful in distinguishing between like ornaments but furnish conclusive evidence only where there is a marked difference in size between two otherwise identical ornaments. Different impressions of the same ornament vary in measurement because of light or heavy inking, newness or wear, or variable degrees of shrinkage in the paper. In the Newcomb chart I have at times given measurements down to a half millimeter; one should not, however, consider them other than the average, often made up from several varying measurements. A knowledge of printers' type-ornaments is generally useless in attempting to identify a particular printer in this period. I have found no one of Newcomb's many type-ornaments that was not also in the stock of other printers. When the identification of the printer of an unsigned book depends on the decorative initials H, I, O, or S, one should be sure to examine the letter both right side up and upside down. Compositors paid little attention to the proper position of such letters, and looked at wrong side up, these letters often present quite a different appearance. Ornaments in the text of a volume occasionally qualify or contradict the evidence of a printer's name in the title-page imprint. A number of the large folios of this period were the work of two or more printers, but the imprint often carries only the name of the printer who ran off the title-page and the first or last portion of the volume. Thus the ornaments in Davenant's Works (1673), signed by Newcomb, indicate that Newcomb and Macock jointly printed the book, while those of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679, signed by Macock, point to the work of both Newcomb and Macock. Further, one should be wary of ascribing to a printer signing a title-page cancel the presswork of the text. In rare instances, as in Cornelius Burgess' The First Sermon (1641) the imprint phrase "By I. L." means only that I. L. printed the cancel; the colophon and the imprint of the original title-page reinforce the evidence of the ornaments in pointing to T. Badger as the rightful printer of the text. Finally, in attributing to a specific printer the presswork of an unsigned book, one is always on surer ground if he can buttress the evidence of the ornamentation with that derived from other reliable sources. One of the obvious sources is the printer-employment habits of the stationer publishing the book. A study of the imprints on books published by Herringman, for example, reveals that he tended to patronize one or two printers consistently in a given period. Therefore anyone attempting to identify the printer of a Herringman volume can eliminate from consideration almost immediately all but the handful of likely candidates; and where the volume in question contains ornaments known to be used by several printers, one can on occasion establish with great probability the one printer whom Herringman hired to do his work. The other source is the wills of the printers with the appended probate statements. Ornament stocks seem to have passed almost overnight from one printer to another, and therefore it is frequently necessary to determine the terminal dates of a printer's activity, lest one interpret the evidence of the ornaments erroneously. For instance, the evidence of ornaments supported by that of the imprints suggests that Thomas Newcomb, Sr., was active as a printer from 1648 to 1691. The probate date of his will indicates, however, that he died late in 1681, and the text of the will points to the fact that Newcomb's son, who happened to have the same name as his father's, inherited the ornament stock and was hence responsible for the Newcomb-printed books between 1682 and 1691. On the other hand, the ornaments of William Wilson appearing in unsigned books published by Herringman as late as 1671 suggest that Wilson was active until that date. Actually Wilson's will was probated in May of 1665; his shop was taken over by his heir and son-in-law, Edward Okes, who used Wilson's ornaments for the next eight years without signing, as far as I have been able to discover, more than two or three imprints in his entire printing career.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The following is a list of occurrences which I have found of the Newcomb ornaments, factotums, and initials pictured in the final pages of this study. Each of the three types of ornamentation has its own heading and separate series of numbers. The entry for each decoration contains this information: (1) an identifying number corresponding to that accompanying the picture of the decoration; (2) the approximate millimeter measurements, with the vertical measurement occurring first; (3) a listing of the books in which the particular decoration is to be found, chronologically arranged and subdivided among the various printers who owned and used the decoration during specific periods of years. "RAWORTH" means always John Raworth, active from 1638 to 1646; "R. RAWORTH", Ruth Raworth, 1646-1648; "NEWCOMB," Thomas Newcomb, Sr., 1648-1681; "NEWCOMB JR.," Thomas Newcomb, Jr., 1682-1688(?). Books in the following list printed before or during 1640 are cited according to the numbers assigned them in the Pollard and Redgrave S.T.C. The remainder are cited according to the numbers given them in the three volumes of the Wing S.T.C. ; the numbers of books listed in the unpublished third volume have been supplied from proof sheets through the courtesy of Mr. D. G. Wing and the Princeton University Library. The occasional book not found listed in either S.T.C. is cited by short title. Where Wing has assigned only one number to a play known to appear in two editions during a single year, I have appended to the Wing number the numbers assigned the different editions by Woodward and McManaway in A Check-list of English Plays 1641-1700 . The brackets enclosing any S.T.C. number indicate that the book has been identified by means of the ornaments as the presswork of a particular printer although his name does not appear in the imprint. The decorations pictured are reproduced usually at approximately life-size; those pictured at less than life-size—generally reduced about one-fifth—are marked with an asterisk accompanying the measurements beneath the picture.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Raworth took up his freedom in the Stationers' Company on February 6, 1632, but appears not to have opened his own shop until 1638. See H. R.

Plomer, English Printers' Ornaments (1924), appear to be similar to those used by Raworth and Newcomb, but Plomer offers no measurements and lists occurrences some thirty years earlier. 3 H. R. Plomer in his Dictionary . . . 1641 to 1667 , p. 136 quotes an entry in the Stationers' Register of Apprentices to the effect that Newcomb was apprenticed to Dexter for eight years from November 8, 1641, but Newcomb's signing books in 1648 attests to the fact that he must have gained his freedom long before November of 1649. One must also disregard, as wrongly dated, the copy of Edward Reynold's Israels Prayer , "By Thomas Newcomb for R. Bostock, 1645." The volume contains Raworth ornaments and sectional titles dated 1649. 4 Calendar of State Papers Domestic, 1682 .

Macock was by 1688 a well established printer who would have little reason to borrow or buy the second hand ornaments of another printer, and yet among the goodly number of Macock-printed books from 1646 to 1691 which I have examined, I have found no other occurrence of either ornament.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Observations on the Incidence and Interpretation of Press Figures 1 by WILLIAM B. TODD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. IN A RECENT STUDY OF PRESS FIGURES, WHICH appear in many eighteenth-century books, Mr. Walter E. Knotts offers a timely reminder of their importance as possible clues to bibliographical analysis, and from his examination of eight copies of a single work proposes a technique for the use of this tool. 2 These figures, if properly understood, are of potential value in the solution of numerous problems, for oftentimes they represent, in the absence or in the unhelpful uniformity of such indications as headlines or watermarks, the only discernible evidence of irregularity in the manufacture of a book. But this evidence, though occasionally observed, is more often ignored, or else is variously interpreted according to hypotheses exclusively derived from the ambiguous data of the figures. Thus far, no attempt has been made to record the incidence of the figures in a substantial number of books, to correlate this data, whenever possible, with other evidence, to formulate a theory comprehending the several vagaries in the use and distribution of the figures, and to present a series of examples illustrating their significance. This enquiry is directed toward the several ends which have been slighted in previous accounts, and though it may fall short of its ultimate objective, endeavors to provide, at least, a more informative basis for further study. Investigation discovers two kinds of information: an explanation for the casual employment of figures in the production of a book, and a rationale for the interpretation of these figures as bibliographical evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. In general, the received opinion concerning press figures 3 is that they were inserted, one to a forme, by the compositor, at the direction of the overseer, in order to identify the press designated to receive the forme, to facilitate an equitable distribution of the work among the presses, and to corroborate each pressman's claim for pay. 4 Contradicting these several suppositions, all of which are founded on cursory comment in printers' manuals published early in the nineteenth century, is other comment from the same sources. Elsewhere it is noted, to the contrary, that it was the pressman's responsibility to work with figures, that in small shops the office of overseer was nonexistent, 5 and that all employees were paid by the hour, the day, or the week, as the convenience of the employer might dictate, and not, as the figures would imply, according to the number of sheets they had worked. 6 To this conflicting testimony may be added that of the books, which show no equitable distribution of the figures, in many instances no figures at all, and, in some, sheets which are only partially figured. And as a final piece of confusion, it is well to recall a chapel rule of 1734 enjoining the pressmen "to put in the Drawer, one of a Sort of every Job, with their Names, the No. wrought, and Day of the Month." 7 For the shops in which this regulation applied, figures would be superfluous, whatever their purpose in the organization of the work or the payment of the men. From the foregoing account it will be apparent that the information in the manuals is quite unenlightening, not only because it is inadequate, but because it indiscriminately reports practices which seemingly vary with the time, the shop, and the number of men employed. Custom or circumstance may require, for some books, the figuring of every sheet, whether or not the work had been predetermined; for others, figures only at the end of a specified period of time; and for others, figures only on those occasions when the work had been disrupted or reassigned. Thus any theory envisaging a uniform procedure in an unorganized, laissez-faire handicraft must be regarded with suspicion. With this caveat against arguments based on selected testimony rather than direct observation, we may turn to those which have at least the merit of being empirical. An obvious approach to the problem, and the one taken by Dr. F. B. Kaye and Mr. Knotts, is to discover the procedure which results in the erratic employment of figures in a single book. For Dr. Kaye the unfigured formes represent the work of a press which is properly identified in the sheet immediately preceding or following the sequence. 8 For Mr. Knotts, on the other hand, they designate the work of an unidentified press. The indication that a forme of any gathering had been printed by this press would be the absence of a number. An examination of a number of eighteenth-century books reveals that often when some (but not all) sheets in a book are figured there are more without press numbers than with them. This suggests that the figures were used to identify formes of sheets which had been worked off by any press other than the one which was doing the bulk of the job. 9 If this latter hypothesis is correct, then we must assume that the printing offices in the eighteenth century, most of which had a normal complement of about twelve pressmen and eighteen compositors, 10 assigned the greater portion of their work to a single press, and only an occasional forme to others. Though we may doubt that the offices were managed as inefficiently as Mr. Knotts seems to imply, his interpretation of the figures is, theoretically, as plausible as the one advanced by Dr. Kaye. The dilemma which confronts the bibliographer is easily resolved, for some books, by reference to the headlines, a kind of evidence overlooked by Mr. Knotts. When the headlines can be distinguished in books containing press figures, they provide a means for the analysis of the figures, and a measure for accepting or rejecting the opposing interpretations. In Gay's Fables (1727), for example, a quarto collating A 4 B-Z 4 2A 2 , the figures are so distributed that, as Mr. Knotts observes, no grouping results of the order required by Dr. Kaye's hypothesis. If the figures are correlated with the headlines, however, a pattern emerges which appears to substantiate the very theory Mr. Knotts intended to disprove. Discounting the headline skeletons for gatherings B, C, and D, all of which are indeterminable, we may represent the others as follows: Now according to Mr. Knotts' belief, no less than forty formes were machined by a single individual, and only seven by the three pressmen identified as 4, 5, and 7. But according to the available evidence, as it may be read from the headlines, the work was more equally divided and the figures revealed to be somewhat more meaningful than Mr. Knotts supposes. The only acceptable interpretation, it seems to me, is this: Two men are originally assigned to the job at "half press" (i.e., one man to a machine), their names properly recorded in the ledger, and their work organized so that they operate in tandem, with one man machining both formes of the sequence?C-E-G-I, and the other, both formes of the alternate sequence?B-?D-F-H-K. Upon the completion of K, the work is interrupted: skeletons I and II are interchanged; III and IV are pied, discarded, or mislaid; V and VI are composed; and two other men take the place of those originally assigned. These identify themselves as 5 and 7 in order to obviate any dispute as to where the "hours" of work for one group ended, and those for the other began. 11 Printing then proceeds through P in the same manner as before, when there is a second interruption, marked, we will note, by the insertion of a figure 4 in each sequence at Q and R. What this signifies, apparently, is that the work previously distributed between two machines operating, as we have conjectured, at half press, is now undertaken as a single sequence by one machine employing two men (4 and an assistant) at full press. Had 4 figured only one of the two sheets, R, for instance, the indication would be that he is replacing 5 only in the one sequence while 7 continues with the other. But since he figures Q as well as R, he signalizes the termination of work by both of his predecessors, assumes credit for all of that which follows, and presumably operates at such a rate—at full press, probably—that he requires for his work the services of the same number of compositors, and the same number of formes, which had been used before. If a single compositor, using two formes, were needed for each of the two presses operating from B to P at half-capacity, then the total of two compositors and four formes might be required for a single press operating from Q to X at full capacity. That 4, with an assistant, is able to work twice as fast and thus to accomplish twice as much in a given period, is confirmed, it would seem, by the time divisions, which show that while the other pressmen, working individually, machine only two or three sheets in a week, 4 machines no less than six. Unlike the others, 4 anticipates the end of his assignment, and marks it at outer X. Once again work is suspended, over Sunday, we may suppose, to be resumed by 5. And since 5 also requires the labors of the two compositors who had been previously assigned to separate presses, he too figures one of the formes supplied by each, verifying the fact that 4 is no longer at work, and then finishes the production by machining Y, Z, 2A, and presumably A . The grouping throughout, we may conclude, is quite apparent, the significance of the numbers for this work not incomprehensible, and their distribution exactly in accordance with Dr. Kaye's premises. For this poem, at any rate, the figures mark the inception and the extent of the work undertaken by those not originally assigned to the job. If this is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence, it follows that an examination of books containing press figures and headlines will permit inferences not to be drawn when one or the other of these indications is absent. In the Fables the figures alone allow no demonstrable theory, and the headlines only a presumption that two presses were operating throughout. But the facts do not always conform to our expectations. Where there are no figures, as in the second volume of the Spectator 12 and in sheets K-2F of the fifth volume, the presumption is, for want of other evidence, indisputable. Where there are figures of a pattern like that in the fourth volume, the presumption is apparently confirmed. But where they are of another pattern, as in the Fables , and in the fourth edition of the Fable of the Bees , the presumption applies only for certain sheets. And for such works as John Williams' Vindication of the Answer to the Popish Address (1688) it does not seem to apply at all. This tract, a quarto collating A-E 4 F 2 , is of the following pattern: Throughout the major portion of this work, and occasionally in the two Fables we have considered, a single press, first τ for A-B, and then * for C-D, seems to be operating at such speed (at full press?), or processing so few sheets, that four skeleton formes are allocated for the job in order to lend more fluidity to the time of distribution. Only in the last two sheets is there a shift in the arrangement, and then the skeletons are distributed, not in the manner we might expect, with I-II to one press and III to another, but with I-II to two presses, and III again to one of these, probably τ. A correlation of the evidence necessitates a modification of our views concerning books with two sets of headlines as well as with those having four. Again there seems to be more disorder than the headlines alone reveal. For the eighth volume of the Spectator the absence of figures implies only a continuance of a process as it had been prearranged, which might be that of a single press machining all sheets, or that of two presses simultaneously machining the inner and outer formes. For the several editions of Clement Ellis's The Protestant Resolved (1688), on the other hand, some other and more specific explanation is required. The patterns are these: In each of these there is no indication, from the headlines, of two presses. From the figures, however, we learn that while * and τ have individually done most of the work performed in shop "B", both simultaneously machined sheets I and K of the first edition, and G, H, and presumably I of the second. Also observe that the termination of the work by the extra press is carefully marked, by a τ in outer L of the first edition, and by an * in inner K of the second. Once again the figures prevent unwarranted claims for pay. James Macpherson's Temora (1763) presents another instance of the extent to which the headlines or the figures, if considered separately, may mislead the bibliographer. In this poem the identification of two sets of headlines, each used successively, one for the inner forme, one for the outer, might indicate work on a single press. The notation of a variety of marks, however, would seem to justify the assertion that the sheets were simultaneously processed by as many as ten different pressmen. Actually neither assumption appears to be valid. Either a number of men were working in relay on two presses or, less plausibly, the formes were allocated to any available press, but to no more than two at a time. Whatever the procedure, it was obviously erratic, undetermined by the overseer, and thus necessitated the marking of every forme to certify the identity of the men performing the work. 13 One other relationship remains to be examined: that between the figures and three sets of headlines. When the third skeleton appears only occasionally it is very probably the one usually employed for the proofing press, but used for final work if one of the other skeletons is unavailable. If intermittently employed, as in sheets B-F of the first edition of Ellis's The Protestant Resolved , no identification is required for any of the formes, since all would represent the work of a single press. An example of a more systematic use of the third press is observed in Susannah Centlivre's The Busie Body [1709] 14 Here, for some reason (perhaps it may be—as we have conjectured before—that 3 is working full press), all but one of the formes through F are marked. 15 After F there is a disruption involving, this time, not a discontinuance of certain forme-skeletons, but a reallocation, apparently for half-press work by three presses operating in succession. Number 3 worked both formes of G, presumably, 5 those of H, 2 those of I, and 3, again, those of K. The regular pattern of figures and headlines which might appear when several presses are operating successively would not be evident, however, when they are operating simultaneously. In this situation any one of the three formes would go to the press that was ready to take it. Consequently the sequence would be indeterminable, subject to arguments later on as to the hours of work performed, and requiring, therefore, as in similar instances cited above, the identification of every forme. A typical example of such an operation appears in the first volume of the Spectator . From this preliminary survey of the correspondence or, more often, the discrepancy between the headlines and the figures in eighteenth-century books, it will be agreed that investigation based on one kind of evidence to the exclusion of the other leads to an oversimplification of the problems involved. Before the expiration of the Licensing Act in 1695 the process of bookmaking was undoubtedly less confused than afterwards: only thirty-five master printers were authorized to practice the trade, 16 and most of these, we may be sure, conformed to the regulation limiting the number of presses and apprentices for each shop. During this period, then, extraneous conditions have not only provided the bibliographer with certain means for detecting occasional irregularities in the production of a book, as these are discerned in various types, headlines, and paper, but limited the output of books he has to examine to relatively few and comparatively well-organized establishments. After 1695, though, the conditions for disorder increase in approximately the same ratio as the means for detecting it disappear. By the end of the eighteenth century the personnel of the trade numbered no less than 2815, 17 but the materials of the trade—ink, paper, and type—had become so standardized that little is known or will ever be known of what these several thousand persons were doing. Even the press figures are uncommunicative. When they appear they seem to indicate a process which is disrupted, reassigned, or uncontrolled, printing engaged at half or full press, simultaneously or sequentially, and, rather obscurely, production over a certain period of time. 18 But they do not reveal, in all instances, the necessity for their appearance, nor the precise information conveyed to the person who ordered their insertion. Thus they remain, at best, as intimations of what will never be fully divulged. 19</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Whatever may be the significance of the figures to the pressmen of the eighteenth century, their importance in contemporary investigation cannot be underestimated. By ignoring these convenient indices to the formes and sheets of various books, bibliographers have devised descriptions so general as to encompass as a single entity works which actually exist in innumerable states, impressions and editions. Even such authorities as Kaye, Griffith, Gulick, Sale, and Worthington, all of whom have occasionally reported the figures as a means of differentiation, fail to report them consistently and completely. Hence their accounts of Mandeville, Pope, Chesterfield, Richardson, and Scott are, one and all, inadequate. Indeed my casual enquiry into the use of these figures as a positive sign of variation among copies allows the assertion that practically every scholarly bibliography and edition of eighteenth-century literature rests on undiscriminated texts. The great value of these figures lies in the convenience with which they may be recorded and subsequently used to distinguish and classify the variants they disclose. For this purpose one need not fill reams of paper with the distinguishing characteristics of the headlines (a fruitless procedure, I might observe, for most editions in this period) or travel about the country with cases of microfilm. The figures are sufficient criteria. 20 In most cases they may be recorded, as a necessary part of the description of a book, by a simple reference to the page and number [as 39—7]. In some, however, it may be necessary, for the purpose of bibliographical analysis, to convert this reference to less simplified notations indicating the forme in which the figure is located [C(i)7], the position of the figure within the forme [C7 v (i)7], or, for half-sheet imposition, the sheet [C—7] or page [C4 v —7] identified by the figure. The method of notation employed should, I think, be determined by the book, and not by any arbitrary principle requiring the presentation of useless information for some works and not enough of what would be essential for others. In the discussion which follows I have, therefore, adopted the most convenient system for the book considered. The analysis of variants . Variation in the presence or kind of figures for a sheet in copies which are otherwise of a single impression indicates (1) a disrupted impression, as this may be occasioned by the substitution of one pressman for another at the same press, (2) a reimpression at other presses to compensate for a miscalculation at the time the tokens were set out for the original printing, or (3) a resetting for the same reason as that accounted for in (2). 21 Though an examination of copies which vary in this respect will usually not permit a discrimination between (1) and (2), 22 it will reveal (3) and allow the explanation suggested. Whether (2) or (3), a decision concerning the priority of variants may be offered on the basis suggested by Dr. Kaye: the later one will have a pattern of figures differing from that evident in the other sheets. 23 Imagination can easily supply any number of incidents as the occasion for an interruption of the kind indicated under (1)—the failure of the first man to report for work after an evening at his favorite pub, or his departure for lunch, or his dismissal for one reason or another. And sometimes a reasonable hypothesis may be deduced from the aberration. In the previously undifferentiated second editions of Pope's Imitations of Horace, The First Epistle of the Second Book and The Second Epistle (1737), the work was performed by four numbered men and one designated as "τ". 24 For both of these second editions numbers 2, 3, 4, and occasionally 1 complete the impression of their formes, but τ works infrequently and then only on the press operated by 1. I think we may presume from this circumstance that 1 is the master printer in Woodfall's shop (perhaps Woodfall himself), and has under his tutelage a young apprentice who is allowed, now and then, to try his hand with a few sheets. If this much is presumed, the conjecture follows that where both figures and symbols appear in the same book, the figures may designate the master and journeymen, who are assigned numbers according to seniority, and the symbols, the apprentices, printers' devils, or "smouters" who are only occasionally employed at press. Consistent variation in the figures for all sheets indicates different impressions or editions. Since the figures are usually entered on or immediately below the direction-line, they may be tied up with that line and the adjacent letter-press when the latter is removed from the forme, and remain as a part of the type page until they are replaced by the figures of other pressmen assigned to work a subsequent impression. When this is the practice the numbers, as always, will change between impressions, but their relative positions within the formes will remain unchanged. A typical example of this procedure is observed in the two "editions" of Samuel Johnson's Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands (1771), an octavo in half-sheets collating A 2 B-K 4 L 2 , and bearing these figures: Here, as the figures imply and as inspection confirms, the second variant, though called a "Second Edition" on its title-page, is actually a reissue (reimpression). 25 Not infrequently, however, the figures will be dropped, along with other superfluous matter, before the pages are retied for storage, and thus reappear in a new impression as different numbers in different positions. Where this has occurred, it is impossible to ascertain, from the figures alone, whether the variant is of the same or another setting of type. 26 During the course of an impression regularly processed according to the order of its signatures, it may be decided to overprint the remaining sheets in anticipation of a second edition. Such a decision will be reflected in the figures, which will vary in number and position throughout that portion of the text which has been reset or reimpressed, but will usually remain invariable in the latter portion, where a single expanded impression suffices for both editions. Thus the incidence of identical figures provides, for the books concerned, instances of a procedure for which Dr. Bowers found no evidence in books of an earlier period: 27 that of a deliberate increase in the number of very late sheets machined at one time to be divided between two editions. The other practice to which Dr. Bowers refers as normal for sixteenth and seventeenth century printing is that of laying aside and later reimpressing the pages to be overprinted. Of the many examples of both procedures, apparently only five are now on record for the eighteenth century: those involving the two editions, first volume, of Gibbon's Decline and Fall ; volumes 2 and 4 of the second and third editions of Chesterfield's Letters ; volumes 1 and 3 of the third and fifth editions of the Letters ; volume 7 of the first and third editions of Richardson's History of Sir Charles Grandison ; and two editions of The New Ministry . 28 Printing according to the order of accessibility . Occasionally it may be inferred, with varying degrees of certainty, that the initial impression of a book has not proceeded according to the order of its signatures, but in some abnormal sequence determined by the availability of the formes. Irregularity is implied, but not demonstrated, whenever identical figures in a second variant reappear, not in the latter portion of that variant, as we should expect for a normal overprint, but scattered throughout several interior sheets. In the absence of indications to the contrary, one explanation for these reiterated figures—as they occur, for example, in sheets D, F, and H of Johnson's Thoughts on the Late Transactions —is that the pressmen so identified accidentally returned to the same formes they had machined before. But for some works, certain considerations disallow this conjecture. For these, we may presume that the formes involved were overlooked in the process of the first impression, either by the pressman, who for one reason or another neglected to machine them until toward the end of his work, when they were then used for an overprinting, or by the compositor, who pushed them aside while he imposed or distributed the type for the others. Before fixing the responsibility upon one or the other we should trace the progress of the forme from the compositor's bench to the press-room and back again in order to determine where and how it could be mislaid. Normally, of course, the proportion between compositors and pressmen will be such that the work proceeds without interruption. Once the intended date of publication has been advertised, however, the distribution of work must be so arranged that the pressmen are never allowed to be idle, for the schedule depends upon their machining a certain number of formes in a given time. It will be of advantage to the overseer, therefore, that he have one or more formes ready at each press so that there will be no delay and consequent disruption of the schedule. The practice of stacking the formes awaiting impression we may consider to be a custom, for a regulation covers the matter: When a compositor carries his form down for press, he is not to put two forms together without a partition between, or forfeiture of two-pence; and in case, through neglect of such partition, a form should be battered, the compositor guilty of such neglect shall forfeit six-pence. 29 Since preservation of type is the primary concern, it is probable that the formes were laid, even with partitions, not one on top of the other, but against a wall where they would be convenient to all the pressmen, or, if they were previously assigned to one, against that man's press. Wherever their location, the formes last imposed would be those most accessible to the men . Infrequently it might happen, particularly if the preceding work is running to a great number of copies, that all the formes of a pamphlet would be stacked and ready for impression, in which case they would be machined throughout in the inverse order of their signatures. 30 So long as the pressman keeps the two formes of a sheet together, it is immaterial whether he selects those for sheets G or M or X, for he knows that sooner or later he and his companions will "work their way to the wall," where he may find some of the early formes—B, D, and F, for example. And if, before he gets that far, the issue has been increased, then B, D, and F will constitute a single impression for the two editions, while G, M, and X, though later in the alphabetical sequence, will be reset or reimpressed in the second. Though there must necessarily be an accumulation of ready-formes in the press-room in order to avoid delay, any accumulation of used formes was considered a nuisance and subject to fine. As soon as a form is wrought-off, the pressman to carry it to a lie-trough, and there completely rub it over with lie, rinse it with water, and then carry it to the wrought-off place, or to the end of the compositor's frame it belongs to. Three-pence for each neglected form. 31 After it has been returned to the "wrought-off place" or directly to the compositor, he too must not be dilatory in distributing type. Jobs to be cleared away immediately after notice being given by the overseer, under the penalty of two-pence for every hour's delay. 32 Usually, of course, the compositor would need no urging to perform this task, for it would often be essential that he distribute in order to keep himself provided with enough sorts to continue composition. And as it takes only one-sixth as long to break type as it does to set it up, 33 he not only has the compulsion of a penalty and the necessity for reusing the type as encouragements to distribute, but sufficient time for the job. It may be said, therefore, that whenever interspersed formes of the first impression reappear in the second impression or edition, these formes have been machined according to the accessibility of the type in the press-room. It is one thing to construct a plausible hypothesis, quite another to prove it. The three examples cited below are arranged according to the degree of irregularity and the amount of corollary evidence supporting the argument advanced. In the first of these, Chesterfield's Case of the Hanover Forces (1743, 8 0 in half-sheets, A 2 B-L 4 M 2 ) 34 a comparison of the two early editions shows these similarities and differences: Sheets reset in "B" reimpressed continuously impressed Edition "A" C-2 D-1 E-3 B-- L-3 AM-1 G-1 F-3 H-3 I-1 K-2 Edition "B" 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 3 3 1 2 [Italics indicate figures in the same position for each edition. Edition "B" sheet G is reimpressed except for reset 2 v -3]. The appearance of an identically positioned figure in the sheet presumably imposed as A 2 +M 2 would seem to indicate a single impression; but since the date on A1 of the "A" edition invariably reads "M.CDD.XLIII.", while that in "B" reads, correctly, "M.DCC.XLIII.", an interruption has occurred between the variants. The sheet in "B" must be considered, then, either as a reimpression, with the presence of the identical figure accounted for as the accidental return of the man to the forme he worked before, or as a continuous impression, with the corrected state appearing, again accidentally, only in the later edition of the copies examined. Though accidence may similarly account for the reiterated figures in F, H, I, and K, the possibility of this diminishes with each additional sheet and may be discounted altogether with reference to four. It would be a strange coincidence indeed that out of the eleven formes of this book, number 2 should return to one of the two formes he had previously impressed. More likely is the supposition that the sheets for "A" were impressed in the order of their accessibility, those later reset being the first, followed by those subsequently reimpressed and, as the stack was uncovered, those continued as a single impression for the planned overprint. The progress of these formes through the press may therefore approximately correspond to this formulary: Edition A AB B B Sheets C-E, B, L, AM, G K, I, H, F B, L, AM, G C-E Copies 1000 1500 500 500 Category impressed reimpressed reset The number of copies for this and later examples represents an arbitrary assignment. In Cumberland's The Imposters (1789, 8 0 , A 2 B-F 8 G 6 ) an order of printing according to accessibility seems to be the only reasonable explanation of the facts. The status of the first two "editions" is this: 35 Since the formes for every sheet, except C and E, were simultaneously impressed in the one issue, but consecutively impressed in the other, it would appear that there was some reason for a shift in the printing arrangements. And that reason, we may confidently assert, can be found in the circumstances pertaining to the impression of C, a sheet which, unlike the others, is apparently of a single impression, and simultaneously machined throughout. What happened, presumably, is that the formes for C were covered by those for D-G, and were thus not available until inner and outer G had been picked up by 1 and 6. Then, after the completion of a run of—let us say—500 copies of G, but before the completion of the same run on C, the decision was made to double the issue, whereupon x and 4 together continued to impress about 900 copies of C in approximately the same amount of time that it took 8 and τ individually to print and perfect 500 copies of B and E. Number 8 then completed the work on AG while 4 machined D and F. The facts of printing, therefore, were probably not too dissimilar to what is represented by the formulary: Issue 1 1-2 2 Sheets B, D-G C B, E, G, D, F Copies 500 1000 500 Category impressed reimpressed Combined in Matthew Lewis's Alfonso, King of Castile (1801, 8 0 in half-sheets, A-P 4 ) are several kinds of evidence which together provide a convincing demonstration of the irregular printing of the first impression. In this, A4 v carries a list of fifteen corrigenda present in eight of the fifteen gatherings. In the second issue (reimpression) of the play the list has been withdrawn and all errata corrected except those appearing in the three sheets having the same figures as before—sheets H, I, and N. Then in the second impression of these sheets (the third issue of the play, titled "The Second Edition") four of the five errata which they contained are finally corrected. From this it follows that H, I, and N were printed without interruption for both of the early issues before the corrigenda were made available for the second, and before they were removed from the press and corrected for the third. To understand these complications as they are now beginning to develop it will be convenient to have before us a tabulation of the data for the pertinent variants. 36 Sheet B C D E F G H I K L M N O P A i a Q R 1st issue (3) (3) - 4 3 (4) (3) (4) 3 (3) 4 (3) 6 (6) 3 2d &amp; 3d issues 6 - 6 6 4 6 (3) (4) - 4 6 (3) - - 6 - 4 6 4 4th issue - 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 - - 4 - - [Sheets containing uncorrected errata are enclosed in parentheses; those continuously impressed for two variants are indicated by italics. Sheet A is dropped and i a Q R added in the third and fourth reimpressed issues]. Since H, I, and N are both by figure and by readings confirmed as a single impression for the first and second issues, we may suppose that they were printed toward the end of the sequence of sheets for the first and in sufficient quantities to provide copies for both issues. Yet they must precede the last two or three sheets, for sometime during the work on P, first issue, the press was stopped for the correction of "requium" to "requiem" (105.5), one of the fifteen errors noted by Lewis when he returned the proof for preliminary gathering A. If H, I, and N had followed A, then it is reasonable to assume that they too would have been corrected at press, especially since number 3 worked on A as well as H and N. And not only must P and A therefore come after the three but very probably the invariant O, a sheet worked by 6, who, we will observe, is lately assigned to this job, apparently for the purpose of hurrying it up. Taking these several factors into account, we are obliged to assume that the first issue was overprinted for three sheets (H-I, N), then reduced to the original quota of copies for three more (O-P, A) in order to insure the publication of the original issue on the scheduled date. After this date there were a number of other improvisations in the making of subsequent issues, all of which may be represented in a formulary. Issue 1 1-3 1 2-3 3 3-4 Sheets B-G,K-M H-I,N O-P,A B-E,G,K-L,O-P,A i , Q-R a,F,M Copies 1000 2000 1000 1000 500 1000 Category impressed reimpressed impressed Issue 4 4 Sheets i ,B-E,G-L,N,O-R HI Copies 500 500 Category revised and reimposed reset [I assume the production of 1000 copies for each of the first two issues, the reuse of 500 copies remaining from the second for the third, and the production of 500 more for the fourth.] Should any more be needed, a measure of proof for the position of H-I, N in the sequence machined for the first issue can be inferred from the construction of subsequent impressions. For the third issue ("Second Edition") sheet A was discarded, four new sheets prepared ( i , a, Q-R), and the remainder of the second issue combined with these to form a complete copy. As all the type for the first issue, excepting H and I, was still standing at the time the fourth issue (also titled "Second Edition") was ordered, it was corrected according to the author's latest desires, then machined by a new group of men. Why was it necessary to reset H and I? 37 If these two sheets had come in their proper sequence during the impression of the second issue, they would have been available for the fourth. But as they obviously were not available, the conclusion is inescapable that they were printed simultaneously with the first and at the beginning of the second issue, then distributed before the decision was made to retain the type of the second for a fourth reimpressed issue. Cast-off copy . Normally an allocation of copy among several shops can be easily detected by variation in the headlines, font of type, type-measure, or paper. But occasionally these differentiae are so minute that they escape notice unless attention is directed to them by evidence of a more conspicuous nature, such as that provided by the figures. These may show a division whenever they appear in one portion of the text, but not in the second, or, less frequently, when they are of one kind in the first portion, and of another in the second. Why the former pattern should be almost invariably represented is inexplicable. 38 Some few copies might be considered as the joint product of two shops, one of which did not use figures; but the presence of numerous exemplars requires another explanation. Whatever the reason, the figures in the following editions signify what other evidence substantiates as a distribution of work.

Even though they are grouped in one portion of the text, they do not indicate divided copy in Gay's Fables , as we have seen, nor do they suggest, in the absence of other and more reliable evidence, what has happened in Mason's Caractacus (1759). Here they appear in the last six gatherings only, but from their presence nothing can be deduced. 40 Cancels . One obvious use for the figures which has been recommended in theory, though, so far as I know, never put into practice, relates to the detection of cancels. As Mr. Chapman has observed, if two figures are present in a forme, one is presumably upon a leaf supplied from another sheet. 41 In each of the following works cancellation may be suspected from the reduplicated figures, and is immediately confirmed by corroborative evidence. Figures (cancel in italics) Collateral proof Burke, An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs (1791) 8 0 42 . . . . . .

C2 v (0)5 C4 v (o)5 chainlines Cumberland, The Wheel of Fortune (1795) 8 0 . . . . A5(o)x A8 v ( 0 ) * [wove paper] 'A8' Other cancels in Burke's Appeal for which the figures provide no clue, however, are B5 (signed) and D8 (signed 'D7'). If there were no signature on the first of these to signify cancellation, it might be inferred, nevertheless, from the absence of a figure. All sheets except B have in their uncancelled state, presumably, two figures; B departs from the pattern by having only one. And as this is on the inner forme (B8-§), the other was very probably on the outer forme of B5 in its original state. Where there is, as in the Appeal , an evident pattern of figures, any irregularity should be regarded with as much suspicion as duplicate figures. In Johnson's Thoughts on the Late Transactions , to cite again an oft-quoted example, the missing figure in sheet K of the first impression (see p. 183) is doubtless explained by the existence of a cancel at K2. Similarly in Edward Young's Centaur Not Fabulous (1755), an octavo, various deviations from customary practice are observed: the register of signatures through $4 for all sheets, except N2 and R2; and the insertion of a single figure for each sheet, except T and 2C, which have two, and E and U, which have none. As the copies examined have all been tightly rebound, corollary evidence is not easily obtained; but the occasional presence of stubs in some exemplars allows a provisional conclusion that this book contains at least five cancels—N1.2, R1.2, and T8 or U1—and probably has several more, or perhaps a complete resetting, in sheets E, T, and 2C. Like the grouping of figures discussed in the previous section, the appearance or disappearance of figures is not always a certain sign of abnormality. To the several instances of this in which cancellation is confirmed, we may add several more which seem to indicate a cancellation that has not occurred. The first, Chesterfield's Vindication of the Case of the Hanover Troops (1743, 8 0 in half-sheets), has a figure 1 entered at D3 v of the initial issue, the same 1 and another at D4 v of the reissue (reimpression). 43 As this pamphlet was printed by half-sheet imposition, requiring only one figure to a forme, the presence of a second calls for explanation. And the only plausible one is that upon the return of the forme for a reissue, the pressman, perhaps realizing that he was subject to a fine for working without figures, 44 looked about for the symbol of the previous man, and not finding it, inserted his own at D4 v . Had he looked on the other side of the forme, we may presume, he would not only have found the figure, but discovered it to be his. Another appears in a cheap reprint of Charles Shadwell's Fair Quaker of Deal (1769, 12 0 ) where, curiously enough, two figures, a 2 and a 4, are found on B11. Quite possibly—my conjecture rests on a single copy (NcD)—one man replaced another at press and failed to remove the figure belonging to his predecessor. A third example, evident in Fielding's Voyage to Lisbon , is more appropriately considered in the next section. Imposition . When the format of a book is for any reason subject to various interpretations, the figures should provide a clue to the disposition of the pages within a given forme, and thus identify the process employed. For the normal method of half-sheet imposition, in which all the pages for a signature are placed within the same chase, the process, involving the use of a single machine, is revealed by a single figure in each gathering. For the alternate method, requiring an arrangement of two successive outer formes in one chase, the corresponding inner formes in another, the process, involving two presses or two distinct operations on the same press, would be occasionally signified by two figures, both of which will appear in one of the half sheets, none in the second, or one in a certain forme of the first, the other in the obverse forme of the second. Again, as with all of my remarks concerning the figures, these generalizations have exceptions. One, Chesterfield's Vindication , has already been mentioned as an instance of accidental duplication in the figures. Another, possibly, occurs in Fielding's second-printed, first-published edition of the Voyage to Lisbon (1755), a duodecimo with its final gathering imposed as a half-sheet and figured N3 v (i)7, N4 v (o)2. Here we would expect, for one gathering, imposition according to the first method, but find, apparently, the arrangements required by the second. Perhaps, if the figures are a reliable indication, the second half-sheet produced was used in another book. In duodecimoes the manner of imposition can be determined, in most instances, by the position of the figures. Normally these will be found only at the most convenient point of insertion, i.e. , at the exposed foot of unsigned pages at either end of the forme. If the pages are, conveniently, of an outer rank, but so positioned that their headlines are exposed, the feet of these pages are as inaccessible as those for the inner rank, and thus remain unfigured. To illustrate the arrangement of the pages in the impositions usually described ( a and d below), possible variations in these arrangements, and the probable location of the figures in all varieties, I present the following data for the outer formes: Practically all eighteenth-century books of duodecimo format were imposed as described under (a); some few, as for example those discussed below, have sheets accidentally imposed, it would seem, in the manner of (b) or (c); but none, so far as I have observed, were imposed as indicated by (d). One instance of disarranged imposition appears in a reprint of Thomas Southerne's Oroonoko (printed for C. Bathurst and others, 1776), in which sheet B is aberrantly signed through $6 (not $5, as normally) and figured 7 v (i)3, 10 v (o)2. The added signature as well as the location of the figures suggests (b) as the manner of imposition. Very probably the rank of leaves 5—8 was not discovered to be misplaced until the outer forme of B had been partially machined. Then, to avoid wastage, the inner was imposed in the same manner, and a signature added to $6 so that the binder would be certain, whatever forme was up, to sect the lower and not the upper third of the sheet. Other instances of irregularity, but only in the location of the figures, are implicit in Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. Part II (1730), 45 where an asterisk is inserted at M10 v , and in Smollett's Humphry Clinker (second edition, 1771), where there are the following discrepancies from the normal pattern: F11 v (i)4, F10 v (o)7; H8(i)4, H9(o)7; and M4 v (o)7. All of these except F conform, again, to (b); and F, apparently, to (c). For these the evidence of aberration becomes less certain, of course, when it rests on the figures alone, and may be explicable on other grounds at present undisclosed. (Outer 11 and 12 would be conjoined whether imposition is [a] or [c].) One example of the confusion that may result when the figures are abnormally placed in a normal imposition appears in the first-published edition of Fielding's Voyage to Lisbon (1755), a book of many bibliographical mysteries, not all of which have as yet been fathomed. In this all gatherings have two figures, one for each forme, except E, F, and G, each of which has three: If the figures in the inner rank were not duplicated in the outer, we might suppose, as for Humphry Clinker , that the first two sheets are instances of (b), the third of (c). Since the figures are reiterated, however, and since the chainlines for all leaves are contiguous with those for their normal counterparts, we must discount, not only this possibility, but another pertaining to cancellation. A third conjecture, that these three gatherings were imposed by 4's and 8's to dispose of split sheet remainders, must also be dismissed; for if this were the procedure, then F would have two figures on the inner four-leaf segment to represent the work of a single press, and only one on the outer eight-leaf segment to represent the work of two. Thus we are perforce reduced to the comment that these figures must reflect some irregularity, not in the production of the book, but in the assignments for its production. Perhaps two agents were involved, the compositor, who accidentally inserts the figures in the middle rank of pages as he imposes them, and the pressman, who fails to discover them in the outer ranks, where they belong, and therefore figures again, number 1 at E12 v , number 2 at F5 v and G8. Though the figures raise, in the Voyage to Lisbon , an intriguing little problem which may not be decided to the satisfaction of all, they do provide the means for solving one of much greater consequence. Excluding those in the inner rank of E, F, and G, which are demonstrably superfluous, and those appearing in I and K, which ambiguously identify either (a) or (d) imposition [I7 v (i)3, I12 v (o)7; K7 v (i)3, K12 v (o)2], the ones remaining are invariably disposed in locations accessible only for imposition with cutting (a). The watermarks, however, seem to indicate the alternate method without cutting (d). These are located, in each gathering, at the outer margin, half-way down the page, and overlapping leaves 9 and 10, their approximate position for the latter method. Between the two kinds of evidence we must choose, I am now convinced, that afforded by the figures, and explain the other as uncommon paper of foreign make, probably Genevan, with the watermark in the middle of the sheet. 46 In this unusual position it appears exactly at the location described for the sheets of the Voyage to Lisbon and verifies the imposition which the figures certify as (a). Thus the information to be derived from the figures is completely justified and leads to a conclusion which might not have been forthcoming had it been ignored. From these several demonstrations of the value of press figures in various phases of bibliographical analysis it is obvious that they are entitled to consideration whenever they appear in eighteenth-century books. In many instances they constitute the only convenient procedure for disclosing hidden variants, "presumed editions," 47 and sophisticated or mixed copies, 48 the only practicable method for detecting and deciding problems at present unknown or unresolved, the only expedient means for selecting and organizing the material to be studied in any investigation, and for describing the exact nature of that material in the bibliographical record. Their presence in the record may not always be informative, but their omission must inevitably deny the scholar the opportunity of confirming the research of others and seriously inhibit his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADDENDUM The recent publication of Mr. Philip Gaskell's article on "Eighteenth-century Press Numbers" [ Library , 5th ser., IV (1950), 249-61] allows me the privilege of anticipating, in his commentary, some of the criticism which may be evoked by my own account. Again I feel constrained to remark that the exclusive interpretation offered by Mr. Gaskell, like the one ventured by Mr. Knotts, cannot prevail against the conflicting testimony of the headlines. Perhaps information other than this may be found to support the ambiguous intimations of the figures—such as that recorded in the printers' ledgers, for instance—but until it is forthcoming I shall continue to refer to the corollary evidence now available, and to reaffirm my conviction (1) that Kaye's theory is, essentially, the only one that comprehends all the facts; (2) that the presence of an anonymous pressman need not, therefore, be presumed for all unfigured sheets; (3) that reiterated figures in both formes of a sheet cannot be regarded as the idiosyncrasy of a compositor or foreman (a surmise which overlooks the strangely intermittent indication of what would be a persistent trait), but rather as the sign of full-press operation or of the termination of simultaneous printing; (4) that a shift in the position of a figure does not necessarily signify reimposition; or conversely, (5) that the appearance of a second figure in the same position as the first may not result from the transfer of the forme, during the course of an impression, to another machine. If one recognizes the probabilities which seem to be confirmed by the examples that I have cited, first, that the figures designate the man and not the machine, and secondly, that the figures may be tied up with the letterpress between impressions, then it can be maintained that the occasional appearance of an alternate but identically positioned figure in some sheets usually indicates a replacement at the same press, and the appearance of this figure in all sheets, a subsequent impression at other presses. Moreover, the association of the figure with the man also permits a rational explanation of the large numbers in a few works, such as the '22' which Mr. Gaskell found in Mrs. Piozzi's Observations on a Journey (1789). Actually, Strahan, the printer, may have owned only seven or eight presses and assigned to each three or more men working in shifts. Despite our several disagreements, Mr. Gaskell and I concur in rearranging the order and reducing the number of impressions which Mr. Knotts devised for the variants of The Beggar's Opera (1728). But where Mr. Gaskell, as a consequence of his premise concerning the variable figures, supposes only one reimposition, and thus limits the total impressions to two—constituting for the first, the groups he labels A—C, for the second, D—G — I wish to defer a commitment on those described as D—E (corresponding to the miscellaneous group 3 in my review) until their status has been determined by the headlines. Meanwhile, it should be mentioned that, in addition to the variants already disclosed, several others have been reported. These I describe according to Mr. Gaskell's classification. Group B C D E F Copy A1 1 v -1 7 v -2 7 v -2 4 v -8 CtY (Plays, vol. 68) 4 v -5 A2 7 v -2 7 v -2 4 r -8 CSmH (Devonshire H.C. 7) 4 v -5 5 r -5 B1 7 v -6 4 r -6 CSmH (Devonshire 151814) 4 v -2 E1 8 v -6 TxU (Ak/ G252/ 728bad) Undoubtedly all but a few of the eleven varieties now identified represent, as Mr. Gaskell suggests, mixed copies or adjustments at press and not separate impressions.</field>

Perhaps a more accurate signification would be "pressman's mark," for, as I shall endeavor to show, the symbol identifies the man rather than the press, and exists in the form of letters and numbers as well as figures. Since this term is of my own coinage, however, and since it might be confused with "printer's mark" or "press mark," both of which have other denotations, I use the customary reference. 4 Cf.

For the Fable of the Bees it would appear that half press is indicated by a figure on one forme of a sheet, full press by a figure on both formes. Note that when 8 is operating at full press (I-L or O-Q) it accomplishes almost twice as much as 7 and 5 at half capacity (M-N). 13 This explanation also suffices for Colley Cibber's The Careless Husband (Tonson, 1735. 12 0 , A-D 12 E 6 ) and for Steele's Dramatic Works (Lintot, 1723. 12 0 , A-L 12 M 6 ). Both have two sets of headlines and numerous figures. 14 Though of the shape and size of an octavo, this play has horizontal chainlines (so I am informed) and thus collates A 4 B-K 4 . My examination has been confined to a facsimile copy of MiU reproduced by the Augustan Reprint Society (Series V, No. 3, 1949). 15 Other instances of what seems to be an unnecessary reiteration of the same figure, but here throughout the impression and only for one forme of each sheet, appear in the first editions of Peacock's Nightmare Abbey (1818—sheet H unfigured, K figured twice) and Coleridge's Fears in Solitude (1798). 16 The figure cited is that for the year 1668. Howe, op. cit. , p. 33. Though the Act limited the master printers to twenty, there is no evidence that they were reduced to that number at any time during the period that the law was on the books. 17 Cf. an anonymous report to Francis Place, cited in Howe, op. cit. , p. 133. 18 Where the figures are apparently used for this latter purpose, as in the Fables , the 4th edition of the Fable of the Bees , and in the 6th and 7th volumes of the Spectator , the time represented may be a week. For these books it is plausible that the men completed, in a six day period, three or more sheets at full press, three or less at half press. The evidence is so ambiguous, however, and so variously recorded by the pressmen as to be almost worthless. 19 It has been suggested to me that the figures might identify the compositors as well as the pressmen, and thus serve as a means for insuring the return of the wrought-off formes to the proper persons for distribution. This would be a plausible assumption were it not for the fact that the figures are highly variable, not present in some formes of an impression, constant in others, shifting in still others, and changing in every forme of a reimpression. Thus for any one setting of type, presumably the work of a single compositor, there may be in the course of its use as many as eight different figures, all identifying the succession of men at press, but none the man who composed the type. An exceptional case is evident, however, in the initial gathering of Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. Part II (1730, 12 0 —the second edition?), where a figure ‡ appears at the foot of every page from A7 to A11 v . Professor James L. Clifford has offered what seems to be the only reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. An apprentice has composed these ten pages and is held responsible for whatever correction is necessary and for the eventual distribution of the type. 20 This comment should be qualified by the observation that pirates may infrequently attempt to duplicate the figures of their copytext as well as the ornaments and typography. Cf. Dr. Giles E. Dawson's article on "Three Shakespearian Piracies" in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia , I (1948), 47-58. 21 For examples other than those noted in this article, see for (1) and (2) Greville Worthington, A Bibliography of the Waverley Novels (1931), p. 12 passim ; for (3) Kaye, op. cit. , II, 394-95. Occasionally the figures remain constant within an impression but move within the forme. Thus in Gay's , figure 7 appears in some copies at M3 v (NN-Berg [2]), in others at M1 v (MB, NN), though the headlines and letterpress are unaltered. Similarly, figure 3 in the second volume of Fielding's Amelia (12 0 , 1752) may appear at position F6 v (CtY) or F7 (CtY, ICU, NN-Berg[2]). Presumably these figures were extracted by the inkballs and replaced. 22 The only positive evidence would be that of the headlines, which would reappear according to pattern in both of the variants resulting from the circumstances described in (1), but only in the first of the variants envisaged under (2). 23 Kaye, op. cit. , II, 394-95. 24 The disclosure of these editions requires supplementary information, which is in preparation for future publication. Of the several editions of the First Epistle , the first is unrecorded, and the second consists of a single impression, not two, as Griffith believes (items 458, 467). Either edition of the Second Epistle corresponds to the general description offered by Griffith under item 447. 25 Throughout this paper my terminology approximately conforms, I trust, to the several definitions set forth in Dr. Bowers' Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949). From the available evidence concerning planned overprints of certain eighteenth-century books, I am, however, unwilling to abandon McKerrow's classification of these as "editions" and to assume with Dr. Bowers (p. 48) that they represent states. For books printed before 1695 it is no doubt true that since legal restrictions operated to prevent an excessive issue of copies from a single setting, the necessary resetting for overprints "presumably occurred," as Dr. Bowers remarks, "during 'continuous printing' and concerns the text of only a small portion of the book." But the lapse of these restrictions brought about a modification of procedure which is evident in numerous books of a later period. In one, Gibbon's Decline and Fall (cited by Dr. Bowers [p. 48, n. 7] as an unusual case), the resetting admittedly involves only about one-third of the text; but this amounts to the impression of 500 sheets on fifty-four formes—or to some 13,500 perfected sheets, in all, which could hardly have been processed simultaneously with the work on the original issue. In a second the resetting, comprising 50% (160 pages) of the text, was certainly not undertaken until after the overprinting of the remainder, for the author was demanding publication of the first issue at the earliest possible date. In a third, resetting constitutes 60% (192 pages) of the text, and some of this was continuously impressed for the "third edition." And for others, as in the several editions of Pope's Epistles , and of The New Ministry cited in the text, printing apparently proceeded up to the last sheet or so before resetting or reimpression was begun. Quite obviously, then, the time-consuming process of recomposing and reprinting early sheets for most, if not all of these books must have been subsequent to the initial publication of the copies produced according to the original plan. Thus the evidence for this period is sufficiently complete, I believe, to deny the necessity and the practice of resetting during continuous printing, and to reject the designation of "states" for books in this category. Actually, if this designation must apply, it will be necessary to subsume under these "states" variant impressions and other "substates"; and this is quite impractical. I have, therefore, accorded such books the status of editions. 26 An instance of successive reimpressions in which the figures are dropped occurs in Gay's The Beggar's Opera . See Knotts, op. cit. More often, however, as Dr. Bowers reports for books printed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the entire type matter, excluding the headlines and quads, is tied together if intended for reuse.

See further note 30 below. 27 Bowers, Principles , p. 110, n. 44. 28 See the respective author-bibliographies by J. E. Norton (p. 38 passim ), S. L. Gulick (p. 97), W. M. Sale (pp. 68, 73-76), and Arthur E.

Howe, op. cit. , pp. 92, 361, n. 1. For all examples discussed in this section two assumptions are implicit: first, that sufficient chases were available in this period for retaining the pages of several formes, and secondly (as this may be demonstrated in the headlines of The Imposters and Alfonso ), that the headlines are an integral part of the type-page, not of the forme, and thus are transferred from one impression to another. 31 Stower, op. cit. , p. 386. 32 Ibid. , p. 385. 33 Howe, op. cit. , p. 381. 34 The editions of this pamphlet here identified as "A" and "B" represent two of some eight editions, only four of which are registered in Gulick's bibliography. "A" has not been previously recorded; "B" corresponds to Gulick No. 301. 35 The "second edition" is actually a reissue (reimpression) of the first. In both issues the figures appear on the same type pages, indicating, as mentioned before, that they were tied up with the letter-press between impressions. Where the figures are in the same position within the page that fact is noted by italics. 36 The circumstances of production for these and other unrecorded variants of Alfonso are so complex as to preclude analysis in this article. See my dissertation, pp. 123-24. 37 In the Princeton copy of the fourth issue the difference between the other gatherings and H-I is accentuated by a change in the paper from wove to laid. 38 The only exception I have seen, besides the two editions of Burnet's Reflections , is volume 7 of the Spectator . Cf. appendix. 39 The only copy I have seen (NN) collates 8 0 , A 4 B-T 8 U 8 (—U8?) X-2R 8 2S 6 4A 8 3B 8 . Dr. Case [ op. cit. , item 172 (6) (a)] correctly infers from the irregularity in the signatures and pagination that sheets N—P, 4A (described by Case as 3A) and 3B must have been printed before the rest of the book. Supporting evidence is represented by the figures for these sheets, and also by the paper, which is distinctly different from that used elsewhere. The figures and the paper also distinguish sheets B—D, but since these conform to the new system of pagination, they were doubtless printed after the others and simultaneously with those machined according to the later plan of imposition. 40 It should be noted, however, that although it is impossible to demonstrate the employment of two shops for this poem, at least two compositors were at work in different sections, one who spells the name "EVELINA" (in D8 v -F1, G4 v -M1 v ), and one who spells it "EVILINA" (in A4 v , C2 v -C4, F1 v -G4 v ). Furthermore, this distinction roughly corresponds to that between the unfigured (A-G) and figured (H-N) portions of the text. 41 "Notes on Cancel Leaves," The Library , 4th ser., V (1924-25), 252. 42 If it is permissible to consider information not to be derived from the book—i.e., for the Appeal , the fact that the whole of sheet E was also cancelled [Thomas MacKnight, History of the Life and Times of Edmund Burke (1860), III, 407-9]—then the precise collation for this insignificant little pamphlet will read: 8 0 , A 2 [=K4.5] B 8 (± 'B5') C 8 (± C5) D 8 (-D8+'D7') E 8 (±) F 8 G 8 (-G8+'G7') H-I 8 K 8 [-K4.5= A 2 ]. 43 Dr. Gulick identifies the first edition (item 305) as existing in two states, one with and one without errata on H4 v . Actually, as the figures show, there are two impressions, with the first in two states. The whole question of the bibliography and authorship of this and the other Hanover pamphlets attributed to Chesterfield is so complex as to require separate consideration elsewhere. 44 Regulation 3 for pressmen, Stower, op. cit. , p. 386. 45 The figure cited for this work is the only one that appears, except for the reiterated figure mentioned in fn. 19. 46 The watermark, a twelve-pointed star measuring 3 cm. across, almost certainly identifies the paper as of Genevan origin, since the law in that locality specifically required the mark to be in the center of the sheet. Cf. C. M. Briquet, Les filigranes (Leipzig, 1923) II, 324, 349. Professor Allen T. Hazen, to whom I am indebted for this reference, also informs me that its appearance in this edition of the Voyage , printed in 1755, is most unusual, for it had been supposed that no Italian or Swiss paper was used by British printers after 1740. Corroborative evidence of the w/m position is to be found, first, in the other edition, which was printed just before this one [cf. Strahan's ledger entries, cited in J. Paul de Castro, "The Printing of Fielding's Works," The Library , 4th ser., I (1920-21), 257-70], on ordinary lily paper (except for A 4 ), and obviously according to imposition (a); secondly, in the preliminary gathering A 4 , which is of the same setting of type in each edition and has, for both, half of the star w/m at the outer edge of A3, an impossible position for a mark normally placed; and thirdly, in the final gathering N 6 of this edition, where half the mark appears at the outer edge of N5, again an impossible position for a normal mark. 47 If scholars would check the figures instead of haunting bookshops for "lost" editions, they might discover the copy they seek on their own shelves. Thus, to cite a trivial example, the unknown but presumed "second edition" of William Whitehead's Variety (1776, 4°) is disclosed as a corrected reimpression of the first.

      <field name="fulltext">BY 1800 BINNY AND RONALDSON WERE DOING rather well for themselves financially. It was only four years before that James Ronaldson, deciding not to rebuild his fire-gutted bakery, had become the partner of Archibald Binny, just arrived from Edinburgh equipped with the skill and tools of type founding. The two men formed an excellent combination: one the business man, the other the craftsman, and both were canny Scots. After a short period of partnership they absorbed the New York foundry of Adam Mappa and later expanded their own shop in Philadelphia. At the turn of the nineteenth century they owned the only foundry in the United States casting English letters. But like most of the other manufacturers of this period, they constantly faced the problem of maintaining an adequate supply of raw materials. Although some of these could be procured in America, many others had to be imported, so Congress, attempting to encourage native manufacturing, admitted a number of items duty free. Importation, however, was a time-consuming process and an expensive one; if, like antimony, the material did not appear on the free list, the duty to be paid was large. When Binny and Ronaldson received approximately three tons in 1800, they were charged the sum of $161.54 as duty. The partners paid the bill, but not without protest. On January 8, 1802, this petition 1 was read in the House of Representatives: To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States The Petition of Binny &amp; Ronaldson Letter Founders in Philadelphia Respectfully Sheweth That your Petitioners have established the Manufacture of Printing Types in Philadelphia, in the prosecution of which they have had many obstacles to encounter, which by industry, attention, and œconomy, they have hitherto surmounted—That the high price of the Metals of which their Types are composed, together with the difficulty of procuring some of them, particularly Regulus of Antimony, is a considerable bar to the success of their establishment —That after many unsuccessful endeavours to procure Regulus, or Antimony from which it might be extracted, in this Country, they have been obliged to send to Europe for it, and with much difficulty and after long delay they succeeded in procuring a quantity of it in London at a very high price, which for the sake of greater security they directed to be shipped in two different vessels, and it was accordingly sent out on board the Susanna and the Pennsylvania, who both arrived in the Delaware in October 1800—That Regulus of Antimony being a new material, not to be procured in this Country and imported for the express purpose of being Manufactured here, they did not expect any duty would have been charged upon its importation, and therefore applied to the Collector of this Port who informed them that he had no power to remit the Duties—That they then applied to Oliver Wolcott Esq r . Secretary of the Treasury who answered them as follows Treasury Department Nov r . 13. 1800 Gentlemen I have received yours of the 18. th October 1800, and feel every disposition to oblige you and to encourage the business which you have undertaken as far as I am authorized by Law, and am sorry that in the present instance it will not permit a compliance with your request, it not being in my power to remit Duties expressly imposed by Act of Congress. I am with consideration Gentlemen Mess rs . Binny &amp;Ronaldson Philadelphia} Your ob t . Ser t . Oliver Wolcott That your Petitioner feel themselves constrained to apply to Congress for relief in the present instance, which from your Justice and laudable inclination to encourage the rising Manufactures of the United States, they have the fullest confidence of obtaining, when it is recollected that all other articles of a similar nature, as far as they were understood at the time of enumerating the Duties, have been expressly exempted, such as Tin, Pewter, Copper, Brass-wire &amp; c .—and Regulus of Antimony would doubtless have also been exempted had it been adverted to, or its uses been known in the Country at that time—That as Regulus of Antimony may be advantageously used in several other branches of Manufacture, and is applicable to no other purpose, your Petitioners submit to this Honourable Body the propriety of remitting the Duties in the present instance and exempting the articles in future, in which case the loss to the Revenue would be trifling indeed and the encouragement to several useful branches of Manufacture very considerable. The amount of the Duties prayed to be remitted are as follows Cw t . qrs. lb. 36 . . 0 . . 0. Imported in the Susanna----------------- $102.48 20 . . 1 . .22. D°. in the Pennsylvania---------------- 59.06 ------- $161.54 May it therefore please your Honours to remit the Duties in the above instance, and to exempt Regulus of Antimony from Duty in future, or to grant such other relief in the premises as to your wisdom may seem proper Arch d . Binny James Ronaldson. Such a petition was not unusual and the House referred it, along with others, to the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The Committee must have studied these petitions very carefully for on February 10, 1802, it submitted a detailed report recommending various changes in the tariff. The Committee stated that such manufactures as are obviously capable of affording to the United States an adequate supply of their several and respective objects, ought to be promoted by the aid of Government. Two modes of administering this aid have presented themselves to your committee: The one, to permit, free of duty, the importation of such gross articles as are essential to those manufactures. The other, to impose higher duties on such articles (on importation) as can be supplied by our own citizens to advantage. 2 And in this vein it recommended that the duty on regulus of antimony be lifted and that the duty on imported printing types be twenty per cent ad valorem —an increase of seven and a half per cent. The news might well have remained buried in the list of proposed duties on such items as fur hats, glue, tarred cordage, pickled fish, and dried fish. But to one journalist, William Duane, publisher of the Philadelphia Aurora , who was in Washington hoping to get the government contract for printing and stationery, this was exciting information. In fact, it is probably true that the duty on type was increased at his suggestion. In 1800 he had married Margaret Bache, widow of Benjamin Franklin Bache, the owner of the Aurora as well as of the type founding materials which Benjamin Franklin had brought from France in 1786. Thus Duane could appreciate the possibilities of establishing a lucrative type foundry once imported types were priced prohibitively high. He proceeded immediately to notify the Aurora . Five days later, it printed the following: From the Editor. Washington, February 10, 1802 . The duty on Antimony is taken off. A duty on foreign types of 20 per cent. laid on. 3 This laconic communication set off a chain reaction which was felt in six cities. A narrative of the effects in chronological order would be confusing even if more scientific. Instead, they will be described city by city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHILADELPHIA On the day following the appearance of Duane's dispatch, Zachariah Poulson Jr.'s American Daily Advertiser reprinted the second sentence and added a paragraph of editorial comment. It pointed to the fact that there was but one type foundry in the United States and that there were "perhaps not more than twelve persons employed." 4 The Advertiser found it hard to understand why, since there were about three thousand persons who derived their support from the printing business, so "many Peters must be robbed to compensate Paul." 5 On the evening of the same day, Samuel Relf's Philadelphia Gazette called attention to this editorial and noted that the increased duty "must materially retard the progress and perfection of the printing business." 6 The next day the Philadelphia Gazette announced that it would publish a detailed consideration of the duty in the following issue. 7 Then, launching the campaign, it devoted almost two columns to the attack. The editor stressed the fact that while Fry and Steele, of London, could furnish more than one hundred different sizes of English letters in addition to characters in many foreign languages, Binny and Ronaldson could not supply more than one twentieth of this amount. While he did not deny that the firm possessed the skill required to make the additional type, he noted that the cost of the matrices would have to be borne by the printer who ordered the type. Nevertheless, even on the limitted ( sic ) scale on which it is conducted, (the english, pica, long-primer and brevier forming at least nine tenths of the demand from them) these gentlemen, possessing a monopoly of the business in America, have, in a few years realised an handsome property. 8 At this point, the editor made a rather unfortunate error. He interpreted the duty to be an additional twenty per cent, not an increase to twenty per cent. After elaborating on the injustice of such an excessive amount, he accused Duane, a British subject, of instigating this increase and concluded with the lament that our public councils should be disgraced by an adherence to the opinions or suggestions of an individual blinded by an inveterate hatred to the country to which he owes his birth and allegiance. 9 Meanwhile, the members of the book trade had been discussing the new tariff among themselves. Finding themselves in general agreement on the steps to be taken, they called for a meeting at Mr. Cameron's, on North Third St., at seven o'clock on Saturday, February twentieth. 10 When they assembled, Mathew Carey was chosen chairman and John H. Oswald secretary. A committee was directed to draft a memorial to Congress, the chairman was requested to ask the representative in Congress to postpone action, and the chairman was also requested to communicate the measures adopted to the printers and booksellers of Boston, New York, and Baltimore. After a resolution to publish the proceedings of the meeting, 11 the members adjourned to meet and receive the memorial on Monday, February twenty-second. Duane, of course, did not neglect to answer the Gazette . His two-column reply included a brief resumé of English type founding, praise for the beautiful type of Binny and Ronaldson, as well as the statement that they employed more than twenty people. 12 Some of his remarks emphasized his personal interest in the increased duty. He declared that there were three different foundries in America which were idle through want of protection; he referred to a foundry in Philadelphia which possessed matrices for every type from non-pareil to five-line Pica, with Greek, Hebrew, and other oriental characters and three hundred different species of typographical ornaments. And, in conclusion, he repeated that several founders would resume if provided with protection. The Gazette printed its reply two days later. Its major point was that the Philadelphia foundry was in Duane's possession, having been acquired from Bache: "This is the clue, which at once unravels the mystery of his pretended attachment to the encouragement of American manufactures !" 13 The Philadelphia book trade continued its campaign, and two papers carried notices of book trade meetings in New York and Baltimore. 14 On March 8, 1802, the following petition was read in the House of Representatives: To the Honorable the Members of the House of Representatives of the United States, The memorial of the undersigned Printers and Booksellers of the City of Philadelphia, Respectfully represents, That your memorialists view with extreme concern a proposition which they understand is at present under the consideration of your Honorable body, for imposing an additional duty upon the importation of printing types—a measure which they cannot but consider as a new proof of the paternal solicitude of the Legislature, extended to the infant manufactures of our country,—but against which your memorialists are urged by imperious considerations to remonstrate. That the encouragement of Domestic Manufactures is an object worthy of Legislative attention, your Memorialists readily acknowledge. They are, however, of opinion, which with all due deference is submitted, that in those instances where our own manufactures are incompetent to the current demand, it is both unwise and impolitic, to prevent, by excessive imposts, a necessary supply by importation from foreign countries Your memorialists beg leave to state, that there is, perhaps, no manufacture in our common country which so little requires the aid contemplated to be afforded by the duty in question, as that of Types. There is at present but one Foundry of English Type in operation within the Union, which they are warranted in saying is inadequate to the supply of the great and growing demand. The proposed duty will in no wise increase the capacity of supply and must operate merely, as a heavy and unequal burden on all persons mediately or immediately concerned in the printing business. Your Memorialists also beg leave respectfully to state that the present duty on the importation of Type, affords sufficient encouragement to the manufacture within the country, so that they are neither altogether dependent on a foreign nation for their supply, nor lie at the mercy of the manufacturers at home. Your memorialists forbear trespassing on the patience of the Legislature, and conclude with expressing a hope that your honorable body will take the premises into serious consideration, and adopt such measures therein as to your wisdom shall seem proper. And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c, &amp;c. Jos: Crukshank. Henry Patrick Rice. W m . Spotswood. Rob t . Aitken. Thomas Dobson. William Ross. John M c Culloch. Z.

      <field name="fulltext">NEW YORK Within two days after Duane's dispatch appeared in the Aurora , it was reprinted in at least three New York newspapers. 15 The following week, the New York editors printed the formal reports of the Philadelphia meeting 16 and the Daily Advertiser printed a short comment on the proposed duty. It called attention to the long article in the Philadelphia Gazette , and repeated the Gazette's mistake in thinking that the duty was an additional twenty per cent. 17 By this time the trade, ready to go into action, requested the printers and booksellers to meet at the Old Coffee House at seven o'clock, Saturday evening, February twenty-seventh. 18 According to the official report, Samuel Campbell was chosen chairman and George F. Hopkins, secretary. After the circular letter from Philadelphia was read, it was unanimously resolved to cooperate with the brethren of Philadelphia, and the Union. A petition to the House of Representatives was drafted, adopted, and ordered engrossed. 19 The unofficial report, however, told a much more interesting story. Cheetham and Denniston's American Citizen published it in the course of an article which defended the increase and which stated that Binny and Ronaldson opposed it because it would create competitors. According to the Citizen : The meeting consisted of sixteen printers, booksellers, and type importers . It was with some difficulty that a chairman was obtained. Mr. Samuel Campbell was at length prevailed upon to take it, and Mr. George F. Hopkins was appointed Secretary. Mr. James Swords opened the business of the meeting by reading a letter which he had received from the chairman and secretary of the meeting of the printers of Philadelphia. This letter merely stated what they had done, and invited their co-operation; it entered not into the merits of the proposed additional duty. Mr. Swords then stated that he had mentioned his reception of the letter privately to Mr. Pintard , (now editor of the Daily Advertiser) who had prepared a suitable remonstrance against the proposed increase of duty. Mr. Denniston asked for specific information of the nature of the meeting—what the additional duty proposed by the committee of commerce and manufacture against which they intended to petition? Mr. Lang, alias Lawyer Lang, then rose, and moved that Mr. Denniston should give to himself the information which he himself required, and instantly dropt upon his chair. Finding that no information could be given him, Mr. Denniston produced the report of the committee of commerce and manufactures in which they propose an additional duty on types. This was read by the secretary. The meeting were astonished. Because Mr. Duane stated that a duty of 20 per cent. would be laid on types, it had been conceived by the typo's present, that this meant 20 per cent. additional duty, which added to the 12½ now paid, makes 32½ per cent. Whereas the report proposes an additional duty of 7½ per cent. only, which, if added to the 12½ now paid, would make the whole duty on types amount to 20 per cent. On this misconception the meeting was called. It is probable the Philadelphia meeting laboured under the same error. Mr. Denniston examined the subject, and stated two grounds for enquiry. 1st. Whether the establishment of foundaries would not benefit the country? 2d. If so, what means ought to be adopted to give them efficacy? He was decidedly in favor of the legislature affording such aid as would enable us to cast our own types, and concluded that this aid ought to consist of an adequately increased duty on the importation of foreign types. Mr. James Swords acknowledged the correctness of Mr. Denniston's remarks, but was of opinion, that to establish foundaries sufficient to supply our wants was impracticable. After a few words in reply from Mr. Denniston, the Chairman very gravely, if not very sagely , informed the meeting that they did not come there to discuss the subject, but to co-operate without discussion with their brethren of Philadelphia. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Swords are both importers of types, and, of course, interested in the non-increase of duty. Many of the Philadelphia meeting are also importers. This is sufficient to account for their opposition. Discussion being thus closed, Mr. Pintard's memorial was read and passed in the affirmative with the exception of Mr. Denniston's vote. The memorial, however, underwent some alteration. It was written under the impression that the proposed increase of duty was 20 per cent; and as this was viewed as tantamount to a prohibition of the importation of foreign types, the memorial was couched in correspondent terms. The error being at length discovered it underwent a suitable alteration. The public are left to draw their own conclusions from this statement of true facts . 20 Two days later, the American Citizen reprinted Duane's long Aurora article 21 and on the same day the Evening Post defended the attack on the duty, declaring that the only persons who oppose them are Duane and Cheetham, "two foreigners." It concluded with a jeer at Thomas Jefferson as well as at his "protege," Duane: Blest era of philosophism and philanthropy, which knows no distinction between natives and foreigners, citizens and aliens, other than forever to give an indiscriminate preference to the latter over the former! 22 And so on March 8, 1802, this petition was read in the House of Representatives: To the Honorable the House of Representatives of the United States; The Memorial of the Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, respectfully sheweth, That, thro' the medium of the public papers and private correspondence, your memorialists have been informed that a proposition is now before your Honorable House for imposing a duty of Twenty per cent. on imported printing Types. Conceiving this measure to be highly impolitic in itself, as directly calculated to do extensive injury to all persons concerned in printing, and indirectly to tax every reader in the United States for the emolument of the few persons who are concerned in 23 the business of Type-founding, they trust your Hon. House will not give its sanction to a measure which, according to the practical knowledge, and the most diligent inquiry of your memorialists, they believe to be founded in error and fraught with extensive mischief. They beg leave to submit to your Honourable House, that at present there exists but one Type-Foundery 24 —in the United States—that they presume it is wholly out of the power of this concern to supply a twentieth part of the demand from printers in America: That there are many species of letters not made at this foundery which are essentially necessary in order properly to conduct the printing business—That the existing duty of 12 1/2 per cent. on printing types appears to be amply sufficient as a protecting duty to this manufacture, as the Foundery at present established in Philadelphia can afford to make and supply Types at a rate quite as reasonable as those imported from Europe. On these grounds your memorialists respectfully trust that your Honourable House, taking the premises into consideration, will not impose a further duty on Printing Types, which would almost amount to a prohibition; a result which your memorialists, from their professional knowledge and pursuits, are persuaded would operate as a public evil, and would materially and injuriously affect the whole business of Printing and Bookselling throughout the United States. All which is humbly submitted. Signed in behalf of the associate meeting of the Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, by Samuel Campbell, Chairman. George F. Hopkins, Secretary.

The leading members of the book trade were not the only New Yorkers who protested. The Franklin Typographical Association, one of the earliest and least known of the typographical societies, forwarded this memorial, read in the House of Representatives on March 15, 1802: To the Hon. the House of Representatives of the United States. The Memorial of the undersigned members of the Franklin Typographical Association of the City of New York respectfully sheweth . . . That your memorialists have been informed, through the medium of the Public Prints, that there is a proposition before your Honourable House, to impose a duty of twenty per cent. on imported Printing Types. Under a full conviction, that every measure entered into by your Honorable House is intended to benefit the Union, your memorialists beg leave to suggest the impropriety of the proposed duty, and hope to be able to show, that, so far from being a beneficial act, it would be highly injurious, not only to your memorialists, but to all persons whose occupations are connected with the Printing Business, either as Printers, Book-binders or Paper-makers . . . First ---Your memorialists beg leave to state, that the addition of 7½ per cent. would almost prohibit the importation of Types; and as the business of Type-founding is yet but in its infancy in the United States, (the present foundery in Philadelphia not being able to furnish a twentieth part of the Type in general use, and being totally destitute of the Oriental, and of almost all the ornamental characters) resort must be had to the measure of importing Books; a measure which the master-printers and Booksellers of New York, by forming themselves into an association, have been patriotically endeavoring to suppress, and which would, almost immediately, deprive two thirds of the Journeymen Printers in the United States, of their means of subsistence, not to mention the great number of Boys, who are at present learning the Printing business, on which they must hereafter depend for a livelihood. Second ---The business of Printing being very expensive to establish, from the high price of materials, very few of those, who are obliged to resort to journey-work when they become free, ever have it in their power to realize a capital sufficient to commence business on their own account; and the contemplated additional duty, by enlarging the barrier, would still diminish their number, to the very great injury of the whole. Third ---As the characters for Printing Books in the dead Languages cannot be had in the United States, nor is it reasonable to expect that they will be furnished for forty years to come; and as there are a number of other works which cannot be done without European materials, all such characters and materials, at least, must, of necessity, be imported from Europe. . . . The consequence would be, that the printing of such Books must either be relinquished, or they must be done at such an expense, as would render them dearer to purchasers, than those of the same kind imported. This would be a severe blow to printing in this country, rising, as it now is, rapidly, to excellence:—and, indeed, in a short time, almost every description of Books must be had from Europe; which would not only distress your memorialists, in a very severe degree, but destroy, in a great measure, the business of Book-binding, and Paper-making, and give a heavy check to the dissemination of learning and useful knowledge. Your memorialists beg leave, also, respectfully to state, that as no art is more conducive to the promotion of learning, liberty and happiness, than that of Printing, so it would seem the policy of the government of our country, to leave unshackled every article appertaining to it; and as the taking off the duty on Regulus of Antimony will be a very considerable encouragement to any foundery that may be established in the United States; and as the present Philadelphia foundery has been, and must still continue to be liberally encouraged; and, in fact, as Types may be here considered as a raw material to manufacture books ; in order to promote the manufacture within ourselves, and thereby to prevent the importation of foreign Editions, we humbly submit to your Honourable House the propriety of taking off, altogether, the duty on Printing Types, or at least of reducing it, so that it may not, in any degree, impede the importation of them; and of laying an additional one, even more than equivalent, on imported Books, for the encouragement of the printing business. . . . If such encouragement be given, no doubt can be entertained of its being fully adequate, in a very few years, to the supply of not only the ordinary works of instruction, and amusement, but of the higher order of classics. But if shackled in the way which has been proposed in your Honourable House, your memorialists foresee an end of enterprize in Printing, and will probably have to seek some other means of obtaining subsistence.—To take off the duty on Types, and to lay an additional one on Books, your memorialists deem not only a wise, but a necessary measure, as the number of people now employed in the printing business, is very large, and is daily increasing. Your memorialists beg leave further to remark, that all those who have arrived at any degree of eminence in the business of Type-founding in Europe, have so great a share of encouragement at home, as to render it highly improbable that any of them would emigrate to this country: Therefore we must expect, at best, if the duty takes place, to have those only (if any should come) who have been but newly established, or who might make their first commencement after their arrival here: consequently, we should still labor under the heavy disadvantage of having but imperfect founderies, and be obliged still to pay the heavy duty; or, which is more probable, import the Books which we should be unable to print. And your memorialists would add, for the information of those of your Honorable House who may not be acquainted with the nature of the Type founding business, or may not have had leisure to make sufficient inquiry, that it is such as to require, at, least, from fifteen to twenty years, before a foundery can be made in any manner perfect: And the truth of this assertion will appear manifest, when it is considered, that the foundery of Mesrs. Binney &amp; Ronaldson, in Philadelphia, had been established in Europe for several years previous to its removal to this country, which took place at least six years ago, and they cannot now furnish a single perfect fount of common Type, owing to the labor and time indispensably necessary to cut the matrixes, &amp;c. &amp;c.— Independent of these considerations, it must be obvious to all; that if the additional duty is laid on, the domestic founders will greatly enhance the price of their Types, which must, of course, occasion a rise on all kinds of Printing Work, and operate as a tax on every reader; from the student in college, to the peruser of the daily newspapers, throughout the United States.— All which is humbly submitted.

      <field name="fulltext">BOSTON With characteristic caution, the Bostonians moved slowly but steadily. The announcement of the proposed tariff revision appeared nine days after it was printed in the Aurora . 25 And it was not until the ninth of March that a book trade meeting voted to present a memorial to Congress. 26 Three days later, the Boston Franklin Association passed a similar resolution. 27 Quite properly, they might have considered their task completed, but they continued to keep the public aware of the controversy. Two papers reprinted the report of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures 28 and as late as March twenty-fourth, the Centinel reprinted an attack on the duty which originally appeared in Worcester a month before. 29 On March 25, 1802, the following resolutions were read in the House of Representatives: To the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the House of Representatives, of the United States in Congress assembled. The Memorial of the Subscribers, Printers, Booksellers, and others, residing in Boston and its Vicinity, most respectfully represents, That they have been informed from Sources which they have cause to fear are correct, that it is in Contemplation of a Committee of your Honourable Body to propose that a considerable additional Duty be laid on the Importation of Printing Types. Considering it as a Fact that such is the Intention of your Committee, your Memorialists feel themselves necessitated to lay before your honourable Body the Reasons which induce them to conceive that the Measure, if adopted, will be oppressive to them and injurious to their Country. 1 st . Because at present, they humbly conceive, it would be impossible to procure a Supply of Types in the United States, equal to the necessary Demand for them; more especially when it is considered that there is a necessity for a much greater variety of founts than can be manufactured in America, in order that the productions of the American press may hold any reasonable competition with those of Europe— 2 d . Because the additional duty, by enhancing the expense on Imported Types, will probably induce the American type founders to advance their present prices in proportion to the additional expense of importation; so that, in fact, it will be burthening several hundred citizens, and cramping an important and interesting manufacture, merely to benefit an individual type foundery, or, at most, perhaps only two; the principal of which, has already, we learn, more orders than it can execute; and which, having no competition, will assume a monopoly of the business. On the disadvantages to a community of such monopolies, we trust, we need not enlarge. 3 d . Because your memorialists conceive, that the business of making types, in the United States, with a suitable capital, can now be carried on to more advantage than in Great Britain; for the present charges of importation on them amount to about 25 P r .Ct. and the raw materials of which types are made, or old type metal, can probably be procured nearly as cheap as in England; so that, excepting the extra price of labour, in America, the founders here may now command 25 per cent. more for their types, than the same types would cost at the European founderies, provided they are equally good. 4 th . Because your memorialists respectfully conceive, that, under any circumstances, it is injurious to the public interest, and a discouraging precedent, to lay duties on articles used in necessary manufactures, which amount nearly to a prohibition, merely to enable individuals to manufacture, and make a large profit on any commodity:—it is, they conceive, oppressing the many for the benefit of the few . 5 th . Because your memorialists have been in the habit of experiencing under former impost laws, particularly those of Massachusetts previous to the establishment of the present government of the United States that printing types have been considered as the implements of an important manufacture, and as such deserving encouragement, and therefore they have either been admitted to be imported free of duty, or considered as a raw material, and subjected to the lowest rate of impost only; the Legislators of both the General and State Governments considering, in this indulgence, that without such encouragement the art of Printing would be embarrassed; that it was important, in a Republican Government, that Books and Newspapers should be afforded as low as possible, in order that they may be within the means of purchase of every citizen; and that it were much more essential to the interests of this country that the means of learning and information should be cheap, than that the single business of type-making should be taken under the patronage of Government. 6 th . Because, your memorialists conceive, that every measure which has a tendency to embarrass the art of Printing, not only discourages literature, and increases the expences of educating the rising generation, but is essentially injurious, in its operation, to the interests of the Bookinders ( sic ), Papermakers, and other manufacturers connected with them.— 7 th . Because, we cherish a hope, that there is sufficient patriotism in the body of Printers to encourage type founding in America, without any restrictive laws;—and we feel confident, when we assert, that no types will be imported, when they can be procured as perfect, and on as good terms, manufactured in the United States. The encouragement afforded to the foundery at Philadelphia is a proof in point:—and it is easy to demonstrate, that a number of inconveniences, / of which procuring imperfections in founts is not the least / arise from the importation of types from Europe . The only plea for the additional duty, which has come to the knowledge of your memorialists, is, that the price of types in Great Britain will be reduced by the Peace. This we readily believe and hope; but we respectfully enquire, will not Peace in Europe also reduce the price of labour in the United States; and thus enable the American type founder more advantageously to prosecute his business, and if he imports his raw materials from Europe, will not their prices also be reduced? especially as we learn with pleasure that the duty on antimony is to be taken off. 8 th . Because your memorialists conceive, that such are the demands for types on the founderies in Great Britain, and so few the number of those founderies therein; that no fears need be entertained that English types will be sent to this country, for a market, with a view to injure the American founding: a number of your memorialists now find it difficult to have any considerable order expeditiously answered at the English founderies. For these reasons, and many others, which we trust will readily suggest themselves to your honourable body, your memorialists earnestly request, that no additional duty may be laid upon the importation of Printing Types. And as in duty bound will ever pray. Boston, March 12, 1802. Benj a Edes. John Boyle. Samuel Hall. James White. David West. William Andrews. J N 1 . West. Oliver C. Greenleaf. Thomas Minns.

The subscribers, members of the "Boston Franklin Association," journeymen Printers of Boston;—beg leave with all due respect and consideration, to present the following Memorial:— --- ---Placed, by Providence, in a land that fosters the civil and political rights of freemen;—in a country that has built its liberties and happiness upon social intercourse, justice, and knowledge;—and whose citizens enjoy the superior privilege, at all times, in a proper manner, to express their sentiments on public measures, whether they be actually adopted, or merely proposed:---Considering that "such Manufactures as are obviously capable of affording to the United States an adequate supply of their several and respective objects, ought to be promoted by the aid of Government:"—but when such domestic Manufactures are not "obviously capable" of supplying the various and necessary demands of the country; should they be so far preferred as to injure the best interests of those classes of society, who are, and from existing local circumstances must continue to be dependent for some time to come on foreign Manufactures?—Laudable as is the intention of Government, to afford prompt and friendly assistance to our own Manufactures, in preference to those of foreign countries; we yet feel confident they will first consult their nature, their expediency, and their utility. ---Fully impressed with these general truths; and having observed that your Committee of Commerce and Manufactures have proposed "that it is expedient to impose a duty, in future, of 20 per cent. ad valorem on Printing Types;" we should be wanting in justice to ourselves, and perhaps to our common country, did we not promptly and respectfully remonstrate; and on principles, we trust, that even those who petitioned to have the additional duty laid on, cannot, but consent to as just and equitable. ---Having a perfect knowledge of the relative branches that constitute our profession; and of course knowing what materials are necessary to its use, whether for elegance, convenience, or durability;—we feel assured, that the Philadelphia Type Foundery could not possibly furnish either the quantity or the quality requisite:—nor could it be able to afford those numerous improvements which we may receive from Europe; and which are most essential, not only to our interest, but the typographical character of the United States. ---as well, in our opinion, might an additional or burthensome duty be laid on foreign hemp and cotton, because, in some small part of this country, it can be raised:—Those States, who could not raise the articles, could not feel greater embarrassment or injury, than the proposed additional duty on Types would affect Printers, and others concerned:—for as the non-producing States would have to pay whatever price was demanded, and the consumers also have to suffer by the inferiority and want of the articles;—in a similar manner the proposed additional duty on Types would affect us, and through us the community at large. ---Whoever is acquainted with the nature of our business, will undoubtedly be fully sensible, that the duty proposed goes to sap if not destroy its most respectable and useful existence;—that, particularly to young men, like us, about entering business, after a laborious, and not far above penurious apprenticeship, it threatens to annihilate our prospects as future masters and as happy and useful members of society:—while our country itself reaps no essential benefit, but actually suffers; perhaps without receiving an honor for maintaining, by heavy duty, a trifling and partial manufacture, which, without competitors, would not only monopolize to itself; but tend to cause Europeans, who must be acquainted with the futility and barreness of our foundery, to encrease their demands;—and thus place our avocation in an impoverished, fatal situation. ---If our country has derived any glory from the freedom of inquiry permitted; if it has become, like Rome and Athens, celebrated for its general literature; if, in short, knowledge ought not to be taxed, and its circulation thereby impeded, if not annihilated:—then your Memorialists conceive, that they, the promulgators, ought not to suffer in an occupation, so necessary, and so important;—particularly as their materials were formerly free of all duty, and merely considered as the tools of mechanics. ---From these considerations, and others too numerous to particularize; your Memorialists humbly pray and hope, That the proposed additional duty on foreign printing Types, be not laid on, as recommended.

Presuming it might be important that the memorial be received by the Legislature, as soon as possible; and as several members who have not signed it, are either absent, or cannot be obtained for signature perhaps in reason; it has been thought most prudent and eligible to forward it in its present state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BALTIMORE As soon as the notice of the Philadelphia meeting reached Baltimore, it was printed with the following paragraph appended: As no time ought to be lost in arresting the progress of a bill which aims so deadly a blow at one of the most flourishing mechanic arts in this country, those interested in this city should be early in co-operating with their brethren of Philadelphia. A meeting therefore of the printers, booksellers, paper-makers, book-binders and stationers, of this city, is requested at James Bryden's Fountain Inn, on Friday evening next at 6 o'clock—All of whom will, more immediately or remotely, be affected by the operation of the contemplated duty. 30 At the meeting, Samuel Butler, Vincent Bonsal, and Matthew Brown were appointed to prepare a memorial for approval the following evening. 31 After it was approved, it was set up in type and forwarded to Congress in print, the only one presented in this fashion. It was read in the House of Representatives on March 8, 1802: To the Hon. the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America; The Subscribers, Printers and others, of the City of Baltimore, who feel themselves affected by the additional duty which they learn is contemplated to be laid on imported Printing Types, Beg leave respectfully to represent , That in the opinion of your Memorialists, any further duty on the Implements of Printing would at this time be impolitic, inasmuch as it would encrease the already too great embarrassments to young beginners in the manufacture of Books; and unjust, inasmuch as it would tax the many for the benefit of the few (for a mere individual) and oppress those whose taste, genius and exertions in a science, if such it may be termed, still in its infancy, have produced specimens of correctness and elegance in the new world, which begin to form a competition with the works of the long established and extensive printing houses of the old—That to encrease the present difficulty of obtaining those implements absolutely requisite, and which in the printing business are more expensive than perhaps in any other, and require even under present circumstances a considerable capital, will be to many, a serious interdiction of the trade, and must force the country for a long time to depend for the Book already made and bound , upon those, who in a little while, with proper encouragement to the Press, can furnish only the tools wherewith to make it. To check the progress of an art already sufficiently embarrassed, would also, your Memorialists believe, materially injure other and essential branches too, of mechanics in this country—those of the paper-maker, of the book-binder and of the skin-dresser. Nor could the book-seller repair the injury done him , even by supplying himself from abroad with those school and common books, which the manufacturer now furnishes him with at home. Your Memorialists would request your serious attention to the following facts,—facts which they hope will have their due influence with your honorable body: On a moderate computation there are nearly one thousand printing houses in the United States, which, notwithstanding the great number of hands they employ—the vast quantity of paper they consume—and the constant supply of various sized types they require—are able to raise but a feeble mound against the flood of imported literature, which threatens to inundate the country. To supply even those offices with type, not to mention others daily establishing, there is but one foundery* in operation on this extensive quarter of the globe—and this but a partial one, since not half of the various denominations and sizes of types used in our mother tongue are cast at it; and not one of the Greek, Oriental and numerous other characters. To erect other founderies, or to complete the present, much taste and many years application are requisite, whilst in the mean time old established founderers will scarcely be induced by the proposed duty, to remove from Europe to this country. From a correct view of the consequences of a dependence on this foundery, or on others which may be established, for that supply of implements which the business daily requires, your honorable body will be fully able to judge whether the apprehensions of your Memorialists be not well founded. The foundery at Philadelphia, it is, however, the interest of the country, it is the interest of the printer to encourage, as far as it can be done consistently with the prosperity of thousands, which should never be sacrificed to the aggrandizement of any individual—and encouraged it has been, as the proprietors themselves acknowledge by the multiplicity of their business and the handsome property they have already acquired—Nor can it arise from a want of patronage, that the money must be deposited with them in advance, at the time of sending an order, although the type, from the great demand, cannot be furnished for many months after. The desire of your petitioners, for the further prosperity and extension of this foundery shall prevent them, although there is but too much room, from drawing an injurious comparison between the durability, symmetry and requisite finish of the type cast there, and of that which is procured from abroad. To tax then, the industry, genius and enterprize of so useful a class of manufacturers as Printers confessedly are, by an exorbitant addition to an impost, already heavy, on the only implements almost with which the manufacture can be carried on, would inevitably be to encourage the importation of literature from abroad—to cause a great rise on foreign as well as domestic made books— to injure if not ruin, a young and flourishing art with its dependencies among us—to multiply the obstacles to knowledge—and to strengthen the empire of ignorance and vice. Your Memorialists pray your honorable body to excuse their prolixity on a subject which few, except professional men, can sufficiently know or appreciate. Note. There is a small foundery at Germantown, which casts German letter only. (Signed) Warner &amp; Hanna, Thomas, Andrews &amp; Butler, Prentiss &amp; Cole, Nathaniel Knight, Samuel M'Crea, A.

      <field name="fulltext">DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The National Intelligencer , after printing the report of the Philadelphia meeting, 32 carried the following notice: A meeting of the Printers and Booksellers of the City of Washington and of George Town is requested at Mr. Barney's Tavern on Saturday at 1 o'clock P. M. in order to consult with a committee of the Printers and Booksellers of Alexandria on measures proper to be pursued in relation to anv contemplated imposition of additional duties on imported Types. 33 Curiously enough, no record of a petition from the District of Columbia can be located. One suspects that Duane attended the meeting and persuaded the group to desist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLESTON At the Carolina Coffee House on March 15, the printers, booksellers, bookbinders, and stationers of Charleston considered "the propriety of addressing congress on the additional duty proposed to be laid on Printing Types." 34 On the following evening, they adopted this memorial, 35 read in the House of Representatives on March 30, 1802: South Carolina. To the Honorable the Speaker &amp; members of the House of Representatives of the United States of America: The Memorial of the Subscribers, printers, booksellers, &amp; Stationers, in the City of Charleston, Respectfully sheweth, That it is with concern your memorialists learn, that your honorable body have it in contemplation to lay an additional duty on Printing Types, imported into the United States; which, when laid, will be equal to 20 p cent on the Cost; and that this will be done under the idea of giving encouragement to the manufacturers of Types in the United States.—Your Memorialists beg leave to assure your honorable body, that if they thought this Idea was well founded, &amp; they could believe that the different fonts of Types used in their Business, could be obtained in the United States, it would give them great satisfaction to find encouragement, in the way proposed, given to the manufactures of their country; but knowing that at this time, there are not founderies amongst us that can furnish the twentieth part of the existing demand, they can view the intended additional duty in no other light than an act that will distress your memorialists, and all others concerned in the business of Printing, Bookselling, &amp;c. and not add to the general good of the Country. Your memorialists beg leave also to observe to your honorable body, that while duties on almost every species of merchandise will fall but lightly on individuals, being borne by the great mass of consumers, duties on mechanical Implements, coming out of the pocket of the laborious artisan alone, must tend to check the progress of trade, and damp the incentives to industry.—Therefore they pray that your honorable body will not agree to the proposed additional duty on Types. And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will pray. Charleston, March 17, 1802. Benj m F. Timothy, W P Young, Bayfield Waller, John Query, John Crow, John Dacqueny, Thomas Sheppard, David R Williams, Tho. Campbell Cox, Peter Freneau, G. M. Bounetheau, T B. Bowen, Since the report of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures had been committed to the Committee of the Whole House, each of the above petitions, when read, was also referred to the Committee of the Whole House. On December 14, 1802, these petitions were referred to the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The committee reported back on February 21, 1803, when the House, adopting their report, resolved that the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, directed to prepare and lay before Congress, early in their next session, a plan for the levying new and more specific duties . . . . 36 And so, in the Tariff Act of March 27, 1804, regulus of antimony was exempted from duty, but there was no mention of any additional duty on imported printing type. Like most of the lobbies which were to come, this one had been successful.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Unrecorded Poems of James Kirke Paulding: An Annotated Check-List by J. ALBERT ROBBINS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A WRITER FINDS HIM-SELF with the leisure time and the inclination to burrow among the artifacts of his literary past. During his sixty-fifth year. James Kirke Paulding began "rummaging" among his old manuscripts. What he found were yellowed and mutilated copies of poems written during his youth and middle age—"careless" verses, he rightly called some of them. Largely to amuse himself, Paulding transcribed into a copybook a large number of these poems and, as the alterations reveal, he later busied himself with polishing and revising some of them. To the collection he added some poems newly written. With the instincts of a writer, Paulding carefully provided his copybook with a preface. Because it is brief and because it gives some indication of his attitude toward his poetry, it deserves quotation in its entirety. In rummaging among my old Manuscripts, I came across the following careless, and occasionally, mutilated, copies of verses, written at various and distant periods, and most of them long since forgotten. I have amused my leisure hours in copying them here, rather as indications of the progress of my feelings and of past events of my youth than as compositions worthy of being preserved. They may serve as memorials to my children, of me, the progress of whose life without being checquered by any remarkable events, has been regularly onwards from Poverty and obscurity to competent independence and honourable distinction. I am now drawing near its close anticipating little and fearing less here, for the result of my various experience has satisfied me how small a portion of our real, substantial happiness, is derived from the gratification of vanity, ambition, or avarice. JKP. New York 1843 P. S. A few of these pieces have been published in Periodicals. Paulding was a little pessimistic in thinking that he was drawing near the close of his life. He was to live seventeen years more, until his eighty-second year, and was to publish three more volumes. Perhaps because of his modest view of the literary value of his poems, Paulding did not seek to collect them in printed form. Certainly his literary reputation is built upon prose in many forms—humorous essays, satirical sketches, short stories, biography, drama, patriotic and sectional writings. He published only two volumes of poetry, the satirical Lay of the Scottish Fiddle in 1813 and the long narrative Backwoodsman in 1818. Nonetheless, throughout his life he continued to experiment with verse. No adequate survey has been made of Paulding as poet. The first book-length study of Paulding was his son William's slipshod memoir-anthology, Literary Life of James K. Paulding (1867). William Paulding quotes several short poems and excerpts longer ones, actually giving a whole chapter to The Backwoodsman , but he provides no critical estimate of his father as a poet. 1 In James Kirke Paulding, Versatile American (1926), Dr. Amos L. Herold gives little attention to the poetry and he lists only a handful of single poems. A study of Paulding's verse—its subject matter and technique—yet remains to be done. A prior task is to locate and call attention to his fugitive poems, scattered though they are. Inasmuch as Paulding's copybook of 1843 is still preserved and available, this forms a logical starting point for such a study. 2 Of the seventy-three 2a poems in the copybook, forty-five bear dates of composition, and these range from 1798 (Paulding's twentieth year) to 1843 (his sixty-fifth year). 3 The largest number of these dated poems falls within Paulding's twenties. There are twenty-two written during these years, ten during his thirties, seven during his forties. As one might expect from a young romantic, the earlier poems are on the subjects of love and death; but gradually he began to write about the literary scene, about America, and about persons whom he knew. Many types of poetry and subject matter are represented. A large number are lyrics. Many are love poems and the names of women are frequent. Some are elegiac and of the graveyard school. Many are conventionally moral in tone. A few, such as "Lament of the Faithless Shepherdess," show the pastoral influence. Several are appreciations of natural beauty, including Niagara and the Hudson river. Two of the poems are highly critical of N. P. Willis and John Jacob Astor; some are on human foibles in general. One criticizes the ubiquitous English traveller as a "creature of arrogance, folly, conceit." There are several on patriotic themes: "The Stripes and Stars," a criticism of the "national apathy" during the War of 1812, a poem welcoming Texas into the Union. A few are concerned with national letters, literary critics, and "these dull prosy times." In length the poems range from mere moralizing couplets to the long, 810-line narrative poem, "The Pilgrim and His Guide," apparently written to illustrate how the easterner's materialistic greed can lead to personal tragedy on the hostile western plains. It is the writer's immediate purpose only to describe this manuscript volume, to place on record a briefly annotated list of its contents, and to record such periodical printings of these poems as he has been able to identify for the first time. Of the seventy-three poems, one of them (number 22 in the check-list) may not be Paulding's, for he writes that he has "some doubts as to its being mine." Three of the seventy-three are listed in Herold's biography as having been published periodically. The periodical publication of eighteen of the poems is here newly identified. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHECK-LIST OF THE 1843 COPYBOOK In the following listing, the titles are given exactly, but no attempt has been made to follow Paulding's capitalization. Following each title are the following data: the date (when indicated in the copybook), the total number of lines of each poem, and the copybook page on which the poem appears. The first line is given for each poem. For those poems whose periodical publication has been discovered, the wording of the printed title has been added when a variant occurs.

Major John André was apprehended in 1780 by three men, one of whom was John Paulding, a relative of James Kirke Paulding. Andre was executed as a spy.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It is obvious that W. I. Paulding did not use the 1843 copybook (as we shall call this ms., using the date of the preface). He refers to one poem (number 41 in the check-list) as the earliest piece of his father's writing he has found. Had he possessed this copybook, he would have seen a poem (number 42 in the check-list) written a year earlier. W. I. Paulding does mention (page 43) "an early Commonplace book" from which he prints a poem found there as a newspaper clipping. He estimates its date as "about 1810" and prints it as "no doubt" of his father's authorship. It is a highly doubtful attribution. The copybook mentioned cannot be the present one: see no. 71 below. 2 The Paulding copybook came into the possession of Dr. Godfrey F. Singer and upon his untimely death became a part of the Singer Memorial Collection presented to the University of Pennsylvania Library. The volume is a typical nineteenth century copybook—a volume of blank pages bound in boards, with an engraved title page reading simply "Album . . ." It measures 7 7/8 by 9 13/16 inches and contains 109 numbered pages. (Pagination through page 55 is in ink, entered apparently by the author, and continued in pencil by another hand. Certain verso pages which are blank are not numbered. A loose sheet of letter paper, inserted at the back of the volume, is numbered 110.) I am indebted to the University of Pennsylvania for permission to publish this study. 2a Seventy-four poems are noted in my checklist, however, since no. 61 is a revision of no. 43. 3 With three exceptions these were all printed during the 1840's. Only two of the poems printed in the 1840's and located to date in printed form were written during that decade. 4 In the check-list these are numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 40, 41, 44, 45, 69, 70, and 73. In a few cases Paulding indicates the periodical or newspaper in which some of the poems appeared. When the writer has been unable to verify these, Paulding's notation is provided.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THOMAS DRUE'S DUCHESS OF SUFFOLK: A PROTESTANT DRAMA by Leslie Mahin Oliver The antagonism that existed so strongly between the theatre and various religious groups during the Elizabethan and Stuart periods, and which achieved its strongest expression, perhaps, in Prynne's Histriomastix and in such plays as The Puritan , may cause us to overlook a minor but definite countertendency of the theatre to play up to the religious interests of a part of the populace. In the earlier decades of the era, mystery and morality plays, though no longer as once under the aegis of the church, remained as reminders to us of the religious origin of the English theatre. We know that down into the 'eighties such plays continued, in diminished numbers, to be written and produced. And from 1590 on, in a theatre increasingly secular and especially anti-Puritan, there were occasional plays that, in whole or in major part, showed a desire in the writers and producers of plays for a raprochement with the bourgeois, church-going elements of the community. As examples of the tendency we may name Greene and Lodge's A Looking-glass for London and England (printed 1594); Sir John Oldcastle , by Drayton and others (1600); Thomas Lord Cromwell (1602); Heywood's If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody (1605); Rowley's When You See Me You Know Me (1605); Dekker and Massinger's The Virgin Martyr (1622); Shakespeare and Fletcher's Henry VIII (1623); Heywood's England's Elizabeth (1631); his Life and Death of Queen Elizabeth (1639); and Shirley's The Martyred Soldier (1638). In the long roll of lost plays there are a number that, judging by their titles, must belong to the same group. All or a substantial part of the following plays must have been, at least, not utterly repugnant to religious-minded people: Pope Joan (produced ca. 1580-1592); Abraham and Lot (ca. 1580-1594); Haughton's The English Fugitives (? 1600); Judas (1601-2); Rowley's Joshua (1602); Dekker and Munday's Jephtha (1602); and Samson (1602). It may be argued, of course, that these plays could not have been very popular or successful, or they would not have been lost; but their mere existence is enough to demonstrate that the minor tendency was present. The period from 1606 to 1621, when no such play is recorded as printed or produced except by such frankly religious groups as that of St. Omers, is the longest hiatus before the closing of the theatres. 1 Among plays of this sort, and perhaps as good an example of the type as we shall find, is The Duchess of Suffolk , by Thomas Drue, produced at the Fortune Theatre in 1623, and printed in 1631. 2 It is a historical drama, and like most of that sort, it appeals strongly to community pride; but the community in this case is not the nation, primarily, but the strongly Protestant left wing of the English Church—the moderate Puritans. There is also a very strong vein of local interest in the play and its production in 1623. The Fortune Theatre stood in Golden Lane, Cripplegate. Scarcely a stone's throw away stood the Barbican, the home of the Duchess and the scene of the first part of the play. An ancient watchtower rebuilt into a residence, the house stood near the corner of Red Cross street and what was later known as Barbican street. It had been a possession of the holders of the Suffolk title since the time of Edward III. As late as 1599, Peregrine Bertie, the son of the Duchess, bequeathed to his son a parcel of land on this street, possibly including the old residence. The Barbican was in a state of ruin in 1682, but did not entirely disappear until late in the 18th century. In its later years it was known as Willoughby House, possibly to distinguish it from the street. 3 In Dryden's day the locality was given over to brothels. 4 The players at the Fortune were the Palsgrave's Company. They had been under the protection of the German princeling Frederick V, Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate, since 1612, when he had come to England to marry the Princess Elizabeth; and they remained under his aegis until 1631. During all this time the Fortune was their special theatre; it burned and was rebuilt (1621-23); it was the scene of riots; the players left it on occasion for excursions in the provinces. But through all their existence as the Palsgrave's Company the Fortune was their center and their home. 5 The Palsgrave, as the king of Poland, is one of the characters in the play, The Duchess of Suffolk . Presumably the players thus honored their patron by presenting a flattering portrait of his predecessor. The Palsgrave's residence is not known, but his son Prince Rupert is said to have lived in Barbican Street. Thomas Deloney, the ballad maker whose version of the Duchess' story, as we shall show, influenced the play, lived in Cripplegate. 6 And John Foxe the martyrologist, from whose Acts and Monuments the material for the play is chiefly drawn, from 1570 to his death in 1587 had owned a house in Grub street, an easy stroll from the theatre, and was buried in St. Giles, which fronts Red Cross street in the same neighborhood. The play, then, knits together a number of neighborhood interests. The lady whose adventures are the subject of the play was the historical Katharine, Dowager Duchess of Suffolk, born in 1519. She was the daughter of Lord Willoughby and of Mary de Salinas, a Spanish Lady of the court of Henry VIII. At her father's death in 1526 she became Baroness of Willoughby. Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, became her guardian, and married her in 1533. She was the Duke's fourth wife, and by him she had two sons. The Duke died in 1545, and the two boys in 1551. Richard Bertie, the Duchess' second husband, whom she married in 1553, was the son of a prosperous stonemason who, like Shakespeare's father, became a gentleman by act of the College of Heralds when his son came up in the world. Richard was a graduate of Oxford, reputed to be an accomplished student of French, Italian, and Latin, and a man of tact and ability. He had been the Duchess' gentleman usher. In the later period of his life he was a member of Parliament for Lincolnshire. 7 There can be little doubt that the character named Foxe, who opens the play, was intended to represent the martyrologist. In a play in which practically every character is historical, which is based on his own book and set and produced in his own old neighborhood, it could scarcely be otherwise. The record of Foxe's ordination as a deacon indicates that he was a tutor in the household of the Duchess in 1550. 8 But Foxe, the Duchess' servant in the play, who envies Bertie's good fortune but goes into exile with his master and mistress, has little in common with his historical counterpart. Drue lavished more attention upon him, however, than upon any other minor character in the play, and made him an individual with more than a spark of life in him. He becomes the chief instrument of the Providence that watched over the Duchess. That the sober, studious, godly Foxe should be shown as worshipping his Protestant heroine, foiling the villainous prelates, and smoothing the path of Protestant exile might be taken, not too cynically, as an allegory of the effect of his book upon the Protestant world. At the very least, this is neither the first nor the last time that Foxe the man has been misunderstood. Almost any history of English literature will serve as another example. The Duchess of Suffolk comes near the end of a surprisingly long list of plays whose plots, in whole or in part, are drawn from the pages of Foxe. 9 In this case, the entire plot, with only minor modifications, is from the Acts and Monuments . Indeed, the play's indebtedness to Foxe is so obvious that its source was probably known and recognized from the beginning. The story of the Duchess' exile on the continent during Mary's reign was not reported in the 1563 edition— the first in English—of the "Book of Martyrs." The only reference to it occurs in a marginal note on page 1680: "Lady Francis, Duchess of Suffolk, who hazarding bothe life, lands, and so great possessions fled her countrey with her husband in cause of her conscience." Foxe, or more probably the translator who Englished his 1559 Latin version, had confused the Dowager Duchess with her stepdaughter. 10 The detailed story was inserted, when the book was revised for the second (1570) edition, among other accounts dealing with "divers saved by God's providence"—persons who, in spite of strong Protestant sympathies, had survived Mary's reign by one means or another. 11 It remained substantially unchanged in succeeding editions. The Dictionary of National Biography asserts, quite plausibly but without offering any proof, that the account was written by Richard Bertie. 12 The whole story is copied, word for word, by Holinshed's editors in the second edition of the Chronicles . 13 Foxe's account tells of the Duchess' flight with her husband and children to escape the enmity of Bishop Gardiner. They made their way by slow stages, suffering hardships and meeting many adventures, to Poland. There they were befriended by the king and allowed to remain in security until the death of Mary made their return to England possible. The story of the Duchess' wanderings had been made into a ballad by Thomas Deloney, and published in 1602 or earlier. 14 Deloney had taken some liberties with the story as told in Foxe, and it is possible, as a result, to say with certainty that the dramatist Drue knew and used the ballad version as well as Foxe's book. Drue follows Deloney rather than Foxe in including an attack by thieves on the Duchess and her party. Foxe has nothing of this. Foxe had told of the party's taking refuge in the church-porch at Wesel; Deloney added that the sexton came and tried to drive them out. Bertie "wrung the churchkeys out of his hand," and beat the drunken janitor over the head with them. This incident also is used by Drue. Deloney also had told of the son, Peregrine, born to the duchess during the early days of the exile, and had named the daughter, Susan, a babe in arms at the time of their flight, who afterward became Countess of Kent. These facts are used in the play, and Drue may have taken them from the ballad. But it is highly probable that Drue had later and more direct sources of information about the personages in the Willoughby family. The influence of the Acts and Monuments upon the play is not confined to Foxe's story of the Duchess' flight and exile. Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer, Marian martyrs, and Dr. Sands, an exile, appear on the stage. Sands, with little effect on the plot but with much damage to his academic and ecclesiastical dignity, is pursued onto and off the stage so often as to become ridiculous. Foxe's story of Dr. Sands is told a few pages after that of the Duchess, but the two stories are not connected. Historically, Sands and Katharine were friends, and they may have met on the continent. The connection may have been suggested to the dramatist by this sentence in Foxe: "Dr. Sands . . . conveyed himself by night to one master Bartly's [i.e., Bertie's?] house, a stranger, who was in the Marshalsea prison with him for a while; he was a good Protestant, and dwelt in Mark-lane." 15 But Bertie was not a "stranger," never was in prison, and did not live in Mark lane. In one speech in the play Sands is called Saunders; a man of that name, according to Foxe, 16 had been Sands' prison-mate. These minor elements of the play are confused and confusing, but the whole complex suggests the hack-dramatist searching out details to fill up his scenes without too much regard for verisimilitude where his main character is not concerned. Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer are introduced in the fourth act, where the dramatist compresses into a single scene the stories of the three martyrs. These he would have found in great detail in Foxe. 17 Historically, the Duchess was a staunch friend of Latimer, and some of his volumes of sermons are dedicated to her. Presumably the playwright's purpose in bringing in these characters is to show dramatically what the Duchess escaped by her flight, and perhaps also to associate her more closely with the main stream of historical events. But the connection is not made obvious in the drama, and the playwright lost a real opportunity to knit his story more closely together when he failed to bring Latimer into an earlier and more organic association with the main plot. To make room for him, Sands could have been eliminated entirely; he is never necessary to the action. One suspects he is present because a part had to be made for one of the comedians of the company. Perhaps the groundlings would have been less pleased, but the development of Latimer's part and the exclusion of Sands would have caused less pain to the Muse of History than she suffers from other things in the play. The burning of Cranmer's hand, for instance, is distorted completely out of its true significance to provide a momentary dramatic sensation. Sir Henry Herbert's Revels Book contains the following entry: For the Palsgrave's Company; The History of the Dutchess of Suffolk; which being full of dangerous matter was much reformed by me; I had two pounds for my pains; Written by Mr. Drew. 18 It would be interesting, if it were possible, to know what "dangerous matter" Sir Henry excised from the play. Perhaps—this is offered as pure speculation— he softened the anti-prelatical elements of the play, which would have been displeasing to the then-crescent high-church party. In 1600 Philip Henslowe listed thirty shillings as paid to William Haughton in earnest of a play called The English Fugitives . Collier assumed that this play was a dramatization of the Duchess of Suffolk's story. Greg, however, thinks it more probable that the play dealt with other matters. 19</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE COMPOSITION AND PRINTING OF MIDDLETON'S A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS * by Gerald J. Eberle In a paper read before the Bibliographical Evidence group at the meeting of the Modern Language Association in Chicago in 1945 I made the point that careful bibliographical analysis of the text of Thomas Middleton's A Mad World , My Masters , 1 1608, along with a study of Middleton's scribal habits, might afford a more generally satisfactory explanation of the aberrations in the quarto than the previously held theory of revision. The publication since then of F. T. Bowers' article, "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear," 2 has led me to believe that the analysis of the composition and printing of A Mad World might be interesting in its own right, apart from its application to the editorial problem; for the first five sheets of the play were printed with three skeletons used in a pattern somewhat different from that in Lear . To complicate matters a bit, no variant formes in these sheets appear in the nine copies of the first edition which I have collated. Incidentally, the two compositors of the first five sheets were accomplished workmen, one of whom set almost all the type for these first sheets—all but D1-4 and E3v-4. The point is significant because apparently a single compositor was not pressed for time in setting all the type for sheets A, B, and C. Some of the phenomena to be detailed here are sufficiently similar to those in Lear to recommend comparison, and sufficiently different to prove puzzling and perhaps enlightening. To facilitate comparison, I have used in the following table the same system of indicating running-title transfers that was used by Bowers. Several oddities deserve special comment, if only as a warning to future students of running-titles used as bibliographical evidence. As indicated in the above table two slightly different titles are used on A4 v . Printing starts with title IIIa, found in copies of the play in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bodleian, the Folger, the Huntington, and the New York Public Library. After a considerable number of copies had been printed the broken initial A was replaced by a better one, but the rest of the running-title was not changed. The title in its improved form, IIIb, appears on A4 v in the copies of the play in the British Museum, Harvard, the Library of Congress, and the Boston Public Library. Thereafter title IIIb appears in all copies on B3 v and C3 v , after which it is rejected. Meanwhile what is apparently the rejected initial A from IIIa re-appears in a new title on B4 v , labeled now IXa, which is used again on C4 v and then set aside temporarily. It appears again on E4 v but its broken initial A is replaced almost immediately, quite by chance by what is apparently the same initial A which had replaced it in title III. Title IXa is found only in the British Museum copy. The notable fact, it seems to me, is that these pages are invariant except for the changed letter in the running-titles. If these pages were proofed, as their general excellence suggests, what sort of proofing before printing might allow the broken running-title to escape notice? That there was ample time for proofing in the first five sheets of the play is obvious when we study the probable order of the formes through the press. The cumulative effect of admittedly inconclusive evidence leads me to believe that the outer formes of both sheet A and sheet B preceded their inner formes through the press. If inner B had been imposed and run before outer B, we should be obliged to account for the delay occasioned by the use in inner B of running-titles from both formes of A. This demands the assumption that sheet A was completed at the end of a working day, in which event both skeletons should have been ready for normal transfer to their respective quarters in the formes of B. Instead we find new running-titles used in outer B, one of them with the previously discarded broken A. Apparently outer B was imposed before either skeleton of A was ready for transfer. Then while outer B printed white paper, the running-titles and furniture from both formes of A were used in inner B. Similarly, if inner A had been first run, its running-titles would presumably have been first ready for transfer to inner B, in which case normal transfer of running-titles would have placed title IV on B3 v instead of on B1 v , and title V on B4 instead of on B2. But if outer A was first run, first rinsed, and first stripped, normal transfer would place title II on B4 and title IIIb on B3 v , which is precisely where they are used. This conjecture, unfortunately, leaves the puzzle of why title I from A2 v was not used. I suspect that by the time the workman was ready to impose B1 v and B2 he had available the running-titles from the two adjacent type pages of inner A, which he preferred to use rather than the single remaining running-title from outer A plus another odd one. It seems likely, then, that the order of formes through the press thus far was outer A, inner A, outer B, inner B; and the pattern of running-title transfers could be indicated as follows: set X, set Y, set Z, set XY, or three different sets plus a fourth composed of parts of the first two. This last point may seem unduly labored; the reason for the insistence lies in the odd repetition of that same pattern in sheets C and D, though of course the running-titles used in inner and outer C are not newly set. The outer forme of C uses the titles from outer B, and is presumably first printed, to be followed by inner C, which uses three titles from inner B plus one new one. The new title can be plausibly accounted for if we assume that imposition of outer C was begun after outer B had been rinsed and stripped. But when the imposition of inner C was begun, the skeleton of inner B was not quite ready for transfer. Overlooking the set-aside running-title from A2 v , the compositor set a new one and imposed C1 v . By the time he had completed that task the inner forme of B had been rinsed and stripped and its running-titles were available for normal transfer. The situation in sheet D is similar. Outer D, like outer B, uses in effect a new skeleton, though two running-titles previously set aside from A2 v and B1 v form part of the skeleton. Composition is again far ahead of presswork; the outer forme of D is imposed with a new skeleton, and the inner forme of D is being imposed shortly before the outer forme of C has been rinsed. Rejecting the broken title IXa, the compositor imposes three quarters of the inner forme of D, making two normal transfers from C3 to D4 and from C1 to D2, and one unusual transfer from C2 v to D3 v instead of to D1 v . By this time the inner forme of C has been rinsed and is available. The normal transfer of running-title from C1 v to D1 v completes the imposition of the inner forme of D. It will be noted that inner D might have been imposed entirely with the skeleton from outer C, had the broken running-title not been rejected. It remains a fact, nevertheless, that the inner forme of D uses running-titles from both formes of C, thus completing the cycle of four sets as in sheets A and B with the same pattern, X, Y, Z, XY. Laboring the point may be wasted effort, especially when one cannot explain exactly why the pattern exists; the point is made because it suggests that sheets B and D were completed at the end of a working day and immediately calls attention to a somewhat similar pattern in Lear . 3 In any case, composition was well ahead of presswork, the new compositor at work in D is not needed to relieve any pressure, and the compositor evidently had sufficient type for sixteen standing pages. As a corollary it seems clear that the resources of the shop were fully utilized in the printing of these sheets. If both formes of D marked the end of a working day, both skeletons might have been available for the imposition of either forme of E. As a matter of fact, both formes of E use running-titles from D. In sheet E, however, it is rather difficult to determine which forme was first imposed and printed because the outer forme of E uses two running-titles from inner D and in addition a single running-title from each of two other formes, outer C and inner C. The problem is not insoluble, however, if we can correctly interpret the following facts: 1. Title X from C1 v is used on D1 v and E2 v . 2. Title V from C2 is used on E1. 3. Titles IIIb and II from the other two pages of inner C were probably distributed before outer E was machined, for we note that the initial A from title IIIb is used to replace the rejected A in the previously set aside title IXa that now appears on E4 v . 4. The use of title X on E2 v and VIII on E3 is the normal pattern of running-title transfers from an inner to an outer forme; and the only sensible reason why the other two titles from inner D were not used must be that the other quarters, E1 and E4 v , were already imposed. In short, the compositor went back to earlier set-aside running-titles because neither skeleton of D was available, but by the time he had imposed E1 and E4 v , side-by-side on the stone, the skeletons of D had been rinsed and were available. The needed two running-titles were taken from the quarters of inner D which are appropriate to normal transfer from inner to outer formes, D1 v to E2 v and D4 to E3. Finally the entire skeleton of the outer forme of D was transferred in normal order to the inner forme of E. And that concluded the printing of the first five sheets of the play. With sheet F a wholly new situation arises. All running-titles from the first five sheets are discarded; they are replaced in sheet F by four new running-titles, one of which has a comma instead of a period after the word " Masters ." These four are used in both formes of F and G and in the inner forme of H. Four other running-titles, one of which has a badly broken upper case W in the word " World ", were used in outer H, and three of these in the final three pages of the play, I1-2. Apparently the outer forme of H was imposed and printed before the inner forme, a second skeleton being introduced to speed up completion of the job. It is likely that the order of the formes through the press was inner F, outer F, inner G, outer G, outer H, inner H. There is obviously nothing to prevent simultaneous imposition of both formes of I. In fact half-sheet imposition seems likely, the running-titles from outer H being transferred as follows: H1 to I1, H2 v to I1 v , and H3 to I2. Signatures F-I differ from the earlier sheets of the play in another important respect—composition. The two efficient compositors of sheets A-E were replaced by one compositor who is not an accomplished workman. His work is easily distinguished from that of the other two by his spelling, by his handling of contractions and apostrophes, and by his sometimes stupid blunders, which are noticeable chiefly in sheet H. Evidently, sheets F and G underwent some sort of correction, for we find only three variants in these two sheets, two on F1 v and one on G3 v . When we find numerous errors throughout sheet H, the comparative absence of errors in F and G strongly suggests that F and G underwent some sort of proofing earlier. Sheet H is truly amazing, exhibiting as it does both formes variant in wildly erratic fashion. For instance we find in outer H in the uncorrected state these flaws: on H1 seven stupid blunders; on H2 v a generally good page with one nonsense line at the bottom; on H3 a faulty speech-tag, An.c later changed to Anc. ; on H4 v a good invariant page. In inner H the situation is much the same; on H1 v there are five stupid blunders limited to the upper half of the page; signature H2 is invariant and good, and shows signs of having been set or extensively corrected by the compositor of the greater part of the first five sheets; on H3 v one word is wrong and one speech-tag is changed from Short. to Short.R. ; signature H4 exists in three states. The wholly uncorrected state, 4 found only in the British Museum copy, has the incorrect catchword Short . All other copies properly read Mast Pan . The third from the last line of text in this copy reads in part "ſhall I intreat a cuteſy?" All other copies properly add the missing r in "curteſy" and omit one of the l's in "ſhall", probably to avoid the necessity of spacing out the line anew; it was certainly not lack of room in the line. The British Museum copy uses Short . as a speech-tag five times. The partially corrected states remove all the errors listed above except the use of Short. , which is hardly an error. The twice corrected states change Short . to Short.R. twice near the top of the page, but leave it unexpanded the other three times it occurs. Here surely is haphazard correction! To complete the discussion of composition we may add that the three pages of sheet I exist in two states. Signature I1 is uncorrected in the Dyce copy of the play in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The variants in I1 v and I2 seem to me to be the result not of correction strictly speaking but of an accident in the course of printing. In those copies of the play that do not lack the FINIS the upper part of signatures I1 v and I2 near their common margin show signs of badly justified lines with type slipping from side to side. I assume that the type in this area pied locally and necessitated re-adjustment. In those copies that lack the FINIS these badly justified lines have been tightened up, but in those areas mistakes have crept in; for instance the i from "ſeriouſly" slips down into the next line with this result: ſerouſly ainother When we add to all this evidence of careless work the significant fact that the badly damaged running-titles in the last sheets of the book were not replaced, as were those in the first sheets, we get a picture the cumulative force of which demonstrates beyond a doubt that the two bibliographically distinguishable sections of A Mad World were composed and printed in quite different ways. Sheets A-E were carefully composed and printed with all the resources of Ballard's shop directed toward turning out a reasonably good piece of work. Then for some reason the printing of A Mad World was stopped. The distribution of running-titles as outlined in step number three above suggests that the decision to set aside this play was reached before sheet E was in the press, but after its type had been set at least in part. When the printing was resumed, a wholly different attitude prevailed. Composition was done by one man in the main, probably an apprentice, certainly not a good compositor. For, as I demonstrated before the Bibliographical Evidence group of the Modern Language Association in Chicago, the entire play shows signs of having been set from Middleton's holograph manuscript, and Middleton's handwriting is very easy to read, unlikely to prove troublesome to a good compositor. Even the printing did not make use of all the facilities of Ballard's shop, presumably because his accomplished workmen were busy with some other job. This entire analysis undoubtedly introduces more questions than answers, but it may prove helpful to some other student with a similar bibliographical problem.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">NOTES ON RESTORATION PLAYS by Robert N. E. Megaw , Homer Goldberg , Frederick O. Waller (1) The Two 1695 Editions of Wycherley's Country-Wife The first edition of William Wycherley's Country-Wife appeared in 1675 with the collation 4 0 , [A] 2 B-O 4 . Before the end of the century four more quarto editions were published, each regularly derived from its predecessor: 1683, collating A 2 B-K 4 ; 1688, a line-for-line paginal reprint of 1683; and two editions in 1695 collating [A] 2 B-I 4 , one a line-for-line paginal reprint of the other. Before the appearance of the Woodward and McManaway Check List of English Plays 1641-1700 the fact that there were two editions, not one, in 1695 had not been recognized; but the Check List separated them, assigning no. 1325 to the edition with "Country Wife" (no hyphen) in the running-titles, and no. 1326 to the edition with the hyphenated running-titles "Country-Wife." 1 Other differences may be added for identification. In 1325 the imprint contains plain italic caps; on sig. C4, line 33, Pinchwife's aside "Will nothing do?" is enclosed in parentheses; and on sig. D1 v the first speech-heading reads " Sr. Jas. " In 1326 swash italic caps head the imprint names Briscoe, Russel-street, and Daniel Dring; the aside is bracketed; and the speech-heading reads " Sir Jas. " These two 1695 editions have not previously been subjected to bibliographical examination to determine their order, but when this is done it is seen that the Woodward and McManaway order should be reversed: 1326 is the true fourth and 1325 the true fifth edition. Since one is a paginal reprint of the other, independent derivation is eliminated and the question resolves itself to the simple determination of which edition was set from 1688 and which was not. Of 86 variations between the two 1695 editions in Act II, for example, 77 in no. 1326 follow 1688 where no. 1325 differs. Three of these are substantives: 1688-no. 1326: that is no wit, out of friendship to me? (C3 v , line 47) no. 1325: that is no whit out of Friendship to me. 1688-no. 1326: to our honours (C4 v , line 38) no. 1325: to our honour 1688-no. 1326: do not use that word naked. (D1, line 3) no. 1325: do not use the word naked. In 46 cases, no. 1326 follows 1688 in spelling, capitalization, or contraction where no. 1325 differs; and in 28 punctuation variants no. 1326 conforms to 1688, where no. 1325 does not. In the light of this overwhelming evidence that no. 1326 was printed from 1688 and that, as a paginal reprint, no. 1325 must derive from 1326, the four minor examples of spelling and punctuation variants in which no. 1325 and 1688, but not no. 1326, agree may readily be dismissed as fortuitous. Collation against the 1675 and the 1683 editions discloses that no. 1326 did not consult these editions and that it is a straight reprint of 1688. Robert N. E. Megaw (2) The Two 1692 Editions of Otway's Caius Marius The first edition of Thomas Otway's History and Fall of Caius Marius , listed in the Woodward and McManaway Check List as no. 880, was published by Thomas Flesher in 1680. The Check List follows with no. 881, an edition for Robert Bentley in 1692, which has a long "s" printed in the word " eft " on the title-page; no. 882, with a short "s", or " est " in the quotation on the title, thereupon follows in the listing as "another issue" of no. 881, with the same date and publisher. This listing as an issue is in error, for no. 882 is throughout in a completely different typesetting from 881, and is the true third edition of the play. 2 The order 880, 881, and 882 is readily established by collation. Nos. 881 and 882 agree in their makeup (a slight condensation of 880), one being a paginal reprint of the other. That edition, therefore, which derives directly from 880 must be the earlier. Various substantive readings point to the agreement of 880 and 881 in cases where 882 differs. 880-881: Lay my gray Hairs low (page 8, line 4) 882: Lay my gray Heirs low 880-881: This Dæmon (page 8, line 15) 882: The Dæmon 880-881: its most dear-bought Honours (page 11, line 29) 882: its more dear-bought Honours This same line of derivation is clearly exemplified by the accidentals, as well: 880-881: my wish'd-for Peace (page 9, line 4) 882: my wish'd for Peace 880-881: Sh'has bin with Sylla (page 10, line 46) 882: Sh'has been with Sylla The second instance is especially good evidence, for although "bin" is the invariable spelling of 880, "been" is the normal form in 881; hence, the few cases in 881 of "bin" reflect its copy-text, and 882 quite naturally normalizes the form to "been." The whole trend of the evidence demonstrates this order without question, and the expected few cases of agreement in accidentals between 880 and 882 against 881, resolve themselves without difficulty into normal corrections by the compositor of 882. 3 The seventeenth-century history of this play may be continued by remarking that no. 883, listed as a 1692 issue for Flesher, is a "ghost," the single recorded copy, that at Northwestern University, being in fact no. 882. No. 884, a 1694 edition reported by Montague Summers but without confirmation, has no recorded exempla and very likely does not exist. Finally, collation establishes that no. 885, the 1696 edition for Bentley, is a reprint of no. 882, a fact which points to 882 as an authorized edition and not a piracy. Homer Goldberg (3) Three 1695 Editions of Jevon's Devil of a Wife Following the first edition in 1686 (no. 662) and the second in 1693 (no. 663) of Thomas Jevon's farce The Devil of a Wife , the Woodward and McManaway Check List records as no. 664 an edition for James Knapton in 1693 (4 preliminary leaves, 47 p.) and another (no. 665) in the same year, also for Knapton (3 preliminary leaves, 42 p.). Under no. 664 it is noted that the Henry E. Huntington Library has another copy of this edition with variant readings. This second copy, which is the same as that held by Chicago and Duke, is, on the contrary, a completely new reset edition and should be assigned the number 664a. Collation establishes that no. 664, the first of the 1695 editions, was set in a condensed makeup from a copy of Knapton's 1693 edition (no. 663), and that 664a is a paginal and line-for-line reprint of 664. 664a 663, 664 C4, line 6 Witnesses to my Proceedings Witnesses of . . . D2, line 11 Nadir Ah come, come. Nadir . Ay, come, come. D3 v , line 28 what Dog is this, where is my Bell? what Dog is this? . . . Bell? G4, line 9 buskins empty smelling buskins empty swelling The similar title-pages and makeup of 664 and 664a furnish no points of identification, but the two editions may be distinguished on the basis of the above readings, although other points may be mentioned. Thus 664 has the correct page number 19 but 664a transposes this in the copies seen to 91. In the persons, in 664 Lovemore is described as "beloved for good old Engl . House-keeping" whereas 664a reads "House-keeper." Various unique readings confirm the evidence of its compressed makeup to indicate that the third 1695 edition, no. 665, did not precede 664. Collation establishes, moreover, that it is derived directly from 664 and not from 664a or from any earlier edition, for it follows the major readings in which 664 varies from 663 but ignores the variants in 664a from 664. Frederick O. Waller Notes 1 In the Check List entry for 1325, confirm CSmH and TxU, and add CLUC and ICU. In the entry for 1326 capitalize "wife" and add IU, MB, MH, MiU, and OCU. 2 As a further identifying point, no. 881 reads " Russel-Street " in the imprint, but 822 " Russel-Street ." Under 881 confirm PU and add CtY, ViU; under 882 add IEN, IU, and MH. 3 That these few agreements of 880 and 882 do not result from the setting of 882 by two compositors, one holding a copy of 880 and the other 881, is demonstrated by the fact that elsewhere on the pages containing these variants, the pattern of the other accidentals derives from 881 and not 880.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EARLY EDITIONS OF ADDISON'S CAMPAIGN * by Robert D. Horn The only modern edition of Addison's poetic works which has any authority is that of Guthkelch. In spite of the many merits of this production, the editing of The Campaign , 1 the poem which marked the turning point in Addison's career, is based on an erroneous bibliography of the early editions (also found in the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature ); and the text is not contrived according to present-day standards of editorial practice. Accepting Tickell's text in the posthumous folio edition of Addison's Works (1721), Guthkelch assumes that the variants from the first edition of 1705 made their initial appearance in the edition of 1708 with the Latin translation. This assumption posits a delay of four years between the first appearance of the poem and Addison's revision of his text. In fact, no such delay occurred, for the poem was revised for the first and only time in the third London edition of 1705. It is the purpose of this study to present a corrected bibliography of the critically important early editions of The Campaign , and to call attention to certain significant bibliographical features affecting our estimate of the authority of the texts. The sequence of editions is as follows: 1. First London Edition (advertised October-November, published December 14, 1704. 2 ) [within double rules] THE | CAMPAIGN, | A | POEM, | To His GRACE the | DUKE of MARLBOROUGH . | [rule] | By Mr. ADDISON . | [rule] | --- Rheni pacator &amp; Istri . | Omnis in hoc Uno variis discordia cessit | Ordinibus; lœtatur Eques, plauditque Senator, | Votaque Patricio certant Plebeia favori . | Claud. de Laud. Stilic. | [rule] | LONDON , | Printed for Jacob Tonson , within Grays-Inn Gate next | Grays-Inn Lane . 1705. 2 0 , [A] 2 B-G 2 [$1 signed], 14 leaves, pp. [4] 1-23 [24] (pp. in sq. bkts. centered) [ variant: misprinting 13 as 31]. A1: hf. tit. [rule] | 'THE | CAMPAIGN, | A | POEM.' | [rule]. A1 v : blank. A2: title (verso blank). B1 (p. 1): HT and text (cap 2 ), ending on G2 (p.23) [rule] | ' FINIS .' | [rule]. G2 v : ' Books Printed for Jacob Tonſon at Grays-Inn Gate.' (cap 3 ), 15 items. Notes: Type-page (leaded) sig. D1, 247(271) X 153 mm. In sheet B the measure is 149-150 mm. Paper watermarked DP. Large-paper (w/m star), NN (Berg), measures 14 5/8" X 9 1/8". Of 19 known copies, only one—in the possession of the writer—contains the mispagination on p. 13. The "Luttrell" inscription on the CSmH copy is highly doubtful, the handwriting being suspect. The pagination brackets are uniform in size and measure 9-10 mm. tall. On the evidence of the ICU copy, which has sheets B and D from the second edition, late copies sold had underprinted sheets made up from the second printing. 2. Second London Edition The title is in the same typesetting as the first edition except for the insertion between the Latin quotation and the imprint: [rule] | The Second Edition. | [rule] | LONDON , | ..... Collation and contents are as in the first edition except that sig. G2 v is blank. Notes: Although the title-page was printed from the standing type of the first edition, the half-title was reset. The type of the half-title is of the same setting as that in the head-title. The top rule in the half-title measures 154 mm. (as against a measurement of 149 mm. in the first edition). A full leaded type-page in sheets B-C and F-G measures 250(273) X 155 mm., which is also the measurement of the pages in the outer forme of sheet E, sigs. E1.2 v . Inner E, sigs. E1 v .2, has a measure of 161 mm. The full type-page in sheet D measures 247(271) X 153 mm. Sheet D is printed from the same DP watermarked paper as the first edition but the other sheets from a somewhat lighter stock with an indistinct watermark which may be ML. The square brackets about the pagination of sigs. B1-D2 v (pp. 1-12) measure 9-10 mm. as in the first edition, but those in sigs. E1-G2 (pp. 13-23) are smaller and measure 7 mm. 3. Third London Edition . [within double rules] THE | CAMPAIGN, | [etc. as in first edition] | Claud. de Laud. Stilic. | Omnium effuſa lætitia eſt &amp; gratis cogitationibus &amp; ſermonibus revocata. | Esse aliquam in terris Gentes quœ suâ impensa, suo labore ac peri- | [4 lines] | Liv. Hiſt. Lib. 33. | [rule] | The Third Edition. | LONDON , | Printed for Jacob Tonson , within Grays-Inn Gate | next Grays-Inn Lane. 1705. 2 0 , [A] 2 [B] 2 C-F 2 [$1 signed], 12 leaves, pp. [4] 1-20 (pp. in sq. bkts. centered). A1: hf. tit. (verso blank). A2: title (verso blank). B1:HT and text (cap 2 ), ending on F2 v (p. 20) with ' FINIS .' Notes: Since there is no possibility of mixed sheets with this edition, technical details are omitted. Paper: no w/m, or faint "W.C." Guthkelch errs in stating that the two new quotations appear first in the 1710 pirated edition. 4. First Scots Edition . THE | CAMPAIGN, | A | POEM | TO | His Grace the Duke | OF | MARLBOROUGH | [row of 4 crown type-orn.] | [rule] | EDINBURGH | Reprinted According to the London Copy M.DCC.V. 4 0 , A-B 4 [$2 signed, A2, B1 in italic], 8 leaves, pp. [1]-[2] 3-16 (pp. in parens centered). A1: title (verso blank). A2 (p. 3): HT and text (cap 2 ) ending on B4 v (p. 16) with 'FINIS.' Notes: Collation, with special reference to the peculiarity of the "British" and "British" forms discussed below, establishes that this edition was set from the first London edition. Owing to the speed with which the second London edition seems to have been prepared, whether the Edinburgh immediately preceded or succeeded it is impossible to determine. This Scots edition has no independent authority and is described here only because of its rarity and to complete the roster of 1705 editions. The three 1705 London editions are all that can possess textual authority, but the precise assignment of authority to all details rests in part on the bibliographical evidence of their printing. In the opinion of the writer, the first edition was hurried to completion in order to be put on sale on the day of Marlborough's return to London. In addition to the evidence which has been cited elsewhere, 3 one may offer signs of haste in the book itself, for at least two and possibly more compositors were concerned in setting its few pages. A marked feature of the spelling in sheets B-C is the invariable form "Brittish," "Brittain," "Brittania," and "Britton," whereas in D-G are consistently found the forms "British," "Britain," and so on. We have, then, what seems to be simultaneous two-section printing of this book in the respective parts A-C and D-G. And if inferences are valid from the University of Chicago copy, which contains sheets B and D from the second edition, it is possible that the edition was enlarged after the type of these first-printed sheets had been distributed. 4 That a very brief interval elapsed between the printing of the first and second editions is suggested by the fact that standing type from the first-edition titlepage was utilized in the second, although all other type had been distributed as printed. Very considerable haste in the preparation of this second edition is shown by bibliographical analysis of its characteristics. A major break in the book between sheets D and E, indicated by the change in the size of the headline square brackets, shows that at least two-section printing with two presses obtained. The separate setting, at a minimum, of sheets F-G is indicated by the use of a very small-font possessive "s" following words set in small caps, which differs from the practice shown in sheet D of using a small-cap "s" as throughout the first edition. This difference is buttressed by the setting of "Marlbro" in F-G without a circumflex, although the form "Marlbrô" is found in D (the name does not appear in B-C). Sheet E, which may be taken as beginning the second section, is irregular because of the unique wide measure used to set its inner forme. The two measures used in the sheet demonstrate composition by formes in order to begin printing with the least possible delay. The compositor of inner E differs from that of sheet D in dropping the circumflex in "Marlbro," but he also differs from F-G in using a small-cap possessive "s" for words set in small caps. That sheet E was not the only sheet to be set by formes may perhaps be indicated by a certain feature of the typography. In the first edition the cases contained a mixture of two kinds of commas, one perceptibly thinner than that proper for the font. These mixed commas are found in the second edition in both formes of sheet B, in inner C and inner D. Only the regular commas which go with the font are found in outer C and D and in all formes of E-G. If the inference is correct that in the first edition sheet D, and possibly B as well, was underprinted by accident or by reason of a subsequent enlargement of edition-sheet, then the fact that in the second edition sheet D, uniquely, was reset with the same measure as the first edition and printed on first-edition paper throughout very likely indicates that this sheet preceded all others through the press as a separate unit in order to complete the edition-sheet for the first edition. 5 The second edition may, therefore, have been sent to the presses in sections as A-C, D, E, F-G, or possibly as A-C, D, E-G. If, then, typesetting for the reprint began and was pushed forward rapidly before the complete exhaustion of first-edition sheets, we may combine this evidence with the standing type of the first-edition title-page to suggest that sale of the first edition was brisk and that no very great time elapsed between the printing of the two editions. 6 Collation of the text of the second against that of the first edition discloses no substantive variants, indicative of revision, but only the scattering of punctuation and capitalization variants which are encountered in any resetting. The number of compositors employed resulted in varying degrees of exactitude with which copy was followed. The relatively short time between the printing of the first and second editions, combined with the absence of substantive revision, makes it extremely unlikely that Addison had anything to do with the copy for the second edition or that any of its variants have authority. This point is of considerable importance for the minutiae of the text, for since the revised third edition was set from a copy of the second, the vast majority of the alterations from the first in the "accidentals" were retained. That by the retention in a substantively revised edition of compositors' variants Addison automatically gave them authority and his approval is a contention that would be utterly unsupported by modern views of the transmission of texts. 7 On the other hand, the changes made in the third edition from the accidentals of its copy-text, the second, may be compositorial or may reflect Addison's markings, or both: that is a decision for an editor in each specific case. Otherwise, only the "accidentals" of the first edition, set from manuscript, have authority. The substantive revisions in the third edition are recorded by Guthkelch, but with the erroneous assumption, previously noted, that they originated in the 1708 edition. At least sixteen such alterations attest to Addison's labors of revision. Twelve alterations are slight changes in wording such as the shift from "indites" to "recites" (line 5), or from "A Captive Host" to "Whole Captive Hosts" (line 355). More positive revisions are confined to four passages, each a single couplet. Although these are strictly rhetorical in interest, they may be regarded as pointing out those passages in which Addison could have sensed the dangers of the kind of turgidity that led Pope to score on The Campaign in his Peri Bathous . 8 Since the revised couplets appear in widely separated passages on pages 4, 8, 13, and 16, it is apparent that Addison submitted the whole poem to critical scrutiny. One example, lines 153-154 on page 8, will suffice to show the general character of his polishing. Whole Nations trampl'd into Dirt, and bruis'd In one promiscuous Carnage lye confus'd. ( First edition ) Nations with Nations mix'd confus'dly lie, And lost in one promiscuous Carnage lye. ( Third edition ) With the recognition that Addison's work on The Campaign was complete with the third edition, subsequent reprints retain but slight importance, although they do show continued interest in the most successful of the several score of Blenheim poems or, indeed, of the larger group of Marlborough panegyrics. The 1708 edition with the Latin translation, Hill's piracy of 1710, T. Warner's edition of 1713, and the reprint in Part VI of the reissue of the Dryden-Tonson Miscellanies in 1716, all listed by Guthkelch, have no textual importance. Unnoticed by Guthkelch are two Tonson editions, of 1713 and 1725, which are labeled as the fifth and sixth editions respectively. The 1713 edition is embellished by an engraving which depicts an Angel bearing a sword and riding the storm clouds above Marlborough's head, while he, mounted on a rearing horse, towers above squadrons of cavalry on the field of combat below. The 1725 edition is an unpretentious octavo, interesting only in that it is the final separate printing to be identified with the name of Tonson, although of course the elder Jacob had retired in 1720. Thus a total of six editions, four of them separate printings, are to be associated with the press of the eminent Kit-Cat printer. The final question remains: which of the three 1705 Tonson texts of The Campaign is to be preferred? Although conventional editorial procedure would select the revised third to reprint, the McKerrow-Greg bibliographical school—conscious of the derivation of some of the "accidentals" of the third from the unauthoritative second edition—would choose the authoritative first edition as copy-text and in this would incorporate the authoritative substantive revisions of the third and such of its unique "accidentals" variants as might be due to Addison's own alterations. 9 To date no edition is available which, according to this standard, is completely satisfactory. 10 Notes * * A census of copies of The Campaign in some fifty English and American libraries discloses only fourteen copies of the first edition. Three others in the possession of the writer, and three in private or dealers' hands, raises the total to twenty, of which nineteen have been examined for variant features. The first edition is held by the following libraries: MH(2), CSmH, CLUC, CtY (badly trimmed, lacking title), MB, NjP, NN, IU, ICU, NNC, TxU, British Museum (Ashley: another copy lost in blitz), and Bodleian.

Horn, "Addison's Campaign and Macaulay," Publications of the Modern Language Association of America , LXIII (1948), 892-93. 3 Horn, op. cit. , p. 893. 4 Some difficulty, which cannot be fully resolved, arises in that sheet C is set in a slightly wider measure, though apparently by the same compositor, than sheet B and, by the evidence of the half-title, sheet A. Just possibly the order of composition was B, A, and C, and the compositor adjusted his measure with C in order to utilize skeletons made up for the latter part. 5 The first-edition sheet D may be recognized by the lack of a comma after "dispense" in line 1 of sig. D1 recto, whereas a comma appears in the second edition. On sig. D2 recto of the first edition the second and third lines end with thin commas, but in the second edition these are of regular font thickness. 6 The writer is indebted to Dr. Bowers for suggestions concerning the bibliographical evidence and its possible interpretation in these editions. 7 For a discussion of this precise point and case-histories from the text of Dryden, see F. Bowers, "Recent Theories of Copy-Text, with an Illustration from Dryden," Modern Philology , for August, 1950. 8 Pope very easily finds in panegyric verse illustrations for Macrology and Pleonasm, "the superfluity of words and vacuity of sense" conjoined. Without naming Addison he remarks, "I am pleased to see one of our greatest adversaries employ this figure." He then offers six isolated lines without comment, and in the following sequence, 199, 202, 193, 268, 168, and 190. Actually, Addison got off very easily. Since Pope's extracts are taken almost without exception from Whig apologists, he may have included Addison as much for his political associations as for being guilty of poetic swellings and tautology. See Works of Pope , ed. Warburton, IV (1788), 173-74. 9 For this editorial procedure, see W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text" earlier in the present volume. Presumably either the "Brittish" or "British" form would be made consistent, however, according to which seems to represent Addison's own usage. 10 The posthumous Tickell edition of 1721 has been made the basis of all modern texts, including that of Guthkelch, instead of the early editions. Tickell, in fact, did restore a number of the first-edition punctuation variants to his third-edition copy-text (this is surely significant coming from Addison's close friend); but, as was inevitable, the compositor of his edition normalized some spellings and treated the capitalization freely so that in certain respects his text is yet one further step removed from basic authority in detail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ANTHOLOGIES OF ENGLISH LITERARY CRITICISM, WARTON TO HASLEWOOD by Rodney M. Baine Although in England reprints and collections of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century poetry and drama were popular throughout the eighteenth century, this eminently critical age lacked easy access to its rich heritage of literary criticism. Only slowly were the classics of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century criticism reprinted, and for these there was so little demand that the editors usually had to share or assume the financial risk of publication. No history of English criticism appeared to supplement Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry . In 1737 Elizabeth Cooper promised " some Account of the Progress of Criticism in England; from Sir Philip Sidney, the Art of English Posey (written by Mr. Puttenham, a Gentleman Pensioner to Queen Elizabeth:) Sir John Harrington, Ben Johnson, &amp; c ." 1 But the volume which was to contain this account never appeared, nor did Dr. Johnson ever write his more ambitious "History of Criticism . . . from Aristotle to the present age." 2 The first separate English reprint of Elizabethan literary criticism seems to have been that of Sidney's Defence of Poesy issued in 1752 by G. Robert Urie, one of Glasgow's foremost publishers. This book, though neatly printed and adorned with a portrait, was an isolated phenomenon, since it did not promote further republication of literary criticism. The unpretentious forerunner of future scholarly collections was published in 1787 by Joseph Warton. Warton had acquired experience as an anthologist by assisting Dodsley to select material for his Collection . He had established a reputation as literary critic by his edition of Virgil, his critical papers in The Adventurer , and his Essay on the Writings and Genius of Alexander Pope . On 18 April 1784 Warton suggested to the printer John Nichols the small compendium which appeared in 1787 as Sir Philip Sydney's Defence of Poetry, and Observations on Poetry and Eloquence, from the Discoveries of Ben Jonson: I have a little Printing-Scheme to mention to you and imagine you will not mislike to join with me in the Profit and Loss . We all know what a Taste is diffused for reading our old Poets. I think some of our old Critics might be made as popular and pleasing. 3 For this venture Warton thus offered to share the expenses and undertook to furnish copy, supply notes, and read proof. Nichols promptly accepted and, evidently on 27 April, Warton sent copy to the printer. For some reason publication was delayed until early in 1787, possibly because Warton was remiss in performing his editorial duties. Of the second volume of his Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope two hundred pages had lain in the warehouse for more than a score of years while the publishers waited for him to complete the volume. Finally, on 12 December 1786, Warton sent in the preliminaries for his collection of literary criticism, suggesting that publication might coincide with his presence in London about January the sixth or seventh. About that date, probably, it appeared, published by G.G.J. and J. Robinson and J. Walter. This slender compendium was possibly Joseph Warton's greatest service to English scholarship; but it had its deficiencies. Warton did not attempt to reproduce the original texts, or probably even to consult them. Instead he used for copy eighteenth-century editions of Sidney's and Jonson's Works , even further modernizing the punctuation and paragraphing and marking for omission several passages in Jonson's Timber, or Discoveries . Nor did the edition include the explanatory notes which the editor had intended to supply. Despite these modernizations, however, sale of the book was slow. Indeed most copies were evidently still unsold when on 8 February 1808 Nichols's warehouse burned with all his stock, so that soon Warton's book was difficult to obtain. Meanwhile at the very end of the eighteenth century, in 1800, accurate scholarly methods were finally applied to the editing of literary criticism. For his edition of Dryden's Critical and Miscellaneous Prose Works Warton's friend Edmond Malone used and collated originals, employing methods which he had helped to perfect in editing Shakespeare. In 1810, two years after most of Warton's edition burned, Sidney's Defence was reprinted by Edward Hovell, Lord Thurlow. He was prompted to replace Warton's editon and, possibly, to help satisfy interest aroused in Sidney by Thomas Zouch's Life and Writings of Sir Philip Sydney , published in 1808. In his edition of The Defence , which appeared in December, 1810, Thurlow made no attempt to apply Malone's scholarly methods to the editing of Sidney. Instead he merely reprinted Warton's text, modernizing the capitals and prefacing five original sonnets. This edition, elegantly printed by W. Bulmer in quarto on large wove paper, evidently found so few purchasers at the shop of White and Cochrane on Fleet Street that Thurlow decided to get rid of some copies by preparing a private or gift issue. For this issue he used the original sheets containing the text of Sidney's Defence but printed new preliminaries. He deleted the publishers' names on the title-page, acknowledged there the sonnets included in both issues, changed the date of publication to 1811, suppressed the advertisement, and added a two-leaf gathering to include an additional original poem. The leaves he had only slightly cut and gilded; and the whole issue he had elegantly bound. 4 Thurlow's edition of Sidney's Defence probably helped to lead Joseph Haslewood, who was already editing scarce and curious Elizabethan material, to publish in 1811 an edition of Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie . At least Haslewood in 1815 omitted Sidney's Defence from his anthology of criticism because it had already been edited by Thurlow's "noble hand." In his edition of Puttenham, Haslewood followed Malone in the tradition of scholarly accuracy and on some points was even more meticulous than his predecessor had been. Haslewood's edition is a page by page reprint of the 1589 Field edition. Even in bibliographical features such as pagination, signatures, and gatherings all the accidental oddities of the original were reproduced. Haslewood skipped page numbers 93 to 100, which had in his original been left unused to compensate for four unpaginated leaves, omitted from many copies, including that used by him. He signed his leaves in the style Field had used, C, C ij, C iij, C iiij, etc. , though why he signed leaf aiij as a 5 and aiiij as a 7 does not appear. In reproducing the original gatherings he was just as scrupulous, imitating the original two-leaf gathering I and only the three leaves that he saw of the original AB gathering. Haslewood's leaves [Bij] and Biij are conjugate and correspond to Field's [ ABij ] and A B iij . The single leaf B, blank like Field's leaf AB , Haslewood had his binder paste onto the preceding leaf. Since in Haslewood's copy of Field's edition the original leaf [ ABiiij ], containing the woodcut portrait of Queen Elizabeth, had been removed from its original position, Haselwood, thinking that he was following Field, omitted this leaf from his B gathering, but had the portrait printed with sheet a to face his general title-page. Accompanying the publication of Puttenham's Arte , Haslewood announced his intention of publishing a uniform edition of all the essays on poetry up to Dryden. Meanwhile he continued to edit and encourage the publication of rare old volumes. In 1812 he helped to found the Roxburghe Club for this purpose. During the same year he became, with Sir Edgerton Brydges, joint editor of The British Bibliographer; and in the fourth volume he printed critical extracts from Henry Reynold's Mythomystes . In 1815 finally appeared Haslewood's anthology of critical essays, The Arte of English Poesie, &amp;c. , later designated, with the Puttenham volume, as Ancient Critical Essays on Poets and Poesie . Complaining of the difficulty of locating copies, Haslewood here renounced his project of reprinting a complete series of critical essays, but this 1815 volume is in itself a magnificent collection. It comprises Gascoigne's Certayne Notes of Instruction , Webbe's Discourse of English Poetrie , King James VI's Treatise of the Airt of Scottis Poesie , Harrington's Apologie of Poetrie , Meres's Comparative Discourse of our English Poets , Campion's Observations in the Art of English Poesie , Daniel's Defense of Rhyme , Bolton's Hypercritica , and five letters on poetry by Spenser and Harvey. Here Haslewood again tried to reproduce his originals as accurately as possible, and he indicated variant readings when he could locate more than one authoritative text. At least some of the volume is, again, a page for page reprint; and though he could not here follow the original pagination and signatures, he varied the style of his signatures to follow his originals. It was beautifully printed in an edition of 220 copies by T. Bensley, Sir Edgerton Brydge's printer. It was a worthy culmination of the renaissance of interest in older criticism begun with Warton's thin collection in 1787. Only a century later was it superseded, and even then the modern editors like G. Smith frequently abstracted what Haslewood had printed in full and modernized punctuation which he had reproduced faithfully.

      <field name="fulltext">PRINTER'S COPY FOR TYRWHITT'S CHAUCER by Atcheson L. Hench The Alderman Library of the University of Virginia was happy to find recently that the annotations in a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer which it owns are those of the great english scholar and editor Thomas Tyrwhitt. It finds further that nearly all the matching fragments of the volume, also annotated, are in the Britism Museum. In 1944 the Alderman Library purchased, at the suggestion of the English department, from Myers and Co. of London, a book-fragment (catalogue 340, item 107) described as "ninety-nine leaves and portions of several others of Speght's edition of Chaucer, 1602, most extensively annotated and corrected by Timothy Thomas . . . in connection with Urry's edition of Chaucer's works . . . of which he was the final editor." In 1946, Dr. George Pace, at that time of the University of Virginia English faculty, examined the emendations and came to the conclusion that they were not those of Timothy Thomas but were probably those of Tyrwhitt; they bore no relation to the Urry text but were identical with Tyrwhitt's text. That the emendations are Tyrwhitt's, Pace has now happily established as true. Recently in London, he writes, he examined a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer in the British Museum (press mark 641.m.19). He saw written on the recto of the leaf which precedes the title page a note, "Bequeathed by Tho s Tyrwhitt Esq. 1786." Furthermore the volume lacks folios 1-85 and 92-108, the very folios which—except for two two-folio breaks—are present in the Alderman fragment. All this makes a pleasing discovery. The Alderman fragment contains the prologue to the Canterbury Tales and all the tales now held authentic except for the two two-folio breaks already mentioned and a segment of the Parson's tale; it also lacks a large part of the apocryphal Plowman's Tale. The marginal emendations, of which there are thousands, and the instructions make it clear that the fragment is part of Tyrwhitt's copy for the printer. They reveal the pains-taking devotion of a great scholar to his task. His five-volume edition of the Tales , the first of the modern ones, was published, part in 1775 and the rest in 1778. He was the first to make sense out of what were then the baffling mysteries of Chaucer's language and the supposed crudities of his verse. The volume deserves and awaits close study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AN UNRECORDED EARLY ANTHOLOGY OF CRABBE by Franklin P. Batdorf The bibliographer of George Crabbe's works has strange opportunities in the United States of America, for on this side of the Atlantic have been preserved several early editions which have not thus far come to light in the libraries of Europe and have not been listed in the bibliographies of Crabbe hitherto published. 1 One of these scarce early editions is a collection of the tales and miscellaneous poems of Crabbe which was brought out in 1847 by H.G. Bohn. A copy of this collection, once owned by the Public School Library of Municipality No. 2, New Orleans, Louisiana, is now in the New Orleans Public Library. 2 The volume is of interest both as a rarity and as an additional testimonial of the popularity of Crabbe's works about the middle of the nineteenth century.

      <field name="fulltext">BENEFACTORS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PRESS: A RECONSIDERATION by Lawrence G. Starkey The story of the establishing of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Press, the first printing house in England's North American colonies, has been told and retold many times during the past one hundred and forty years, but the known facts about its founding are still relatively few, singularly open to various interpretations, and really not materially augmented over those set down by Isaiah Thomas in the first edition of his History of Printing in America (1810). Especially lacking are details about the financing of the original printing house established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1638. Writers on the subject have been understandably reluctant to accept as sole founder and benefactor of the Cambridge Press the Reverend Jose Glover, Non-Con-formist clergyman of Surrey, who died at sea in the summer of 1638 while conveying the press and other printing equipment and supplies to Massachusetts. There is, indeed, some evidence that others besides Glover helped to procure the press and fonts of type for the new colony. Speculation about these circumstances by writers on the Press seems to stem almost completely from two entries made by the third president of Harvard College, Leonard Hoar, in the early records of the college. In 1674 Hoar, attempting to list for posterity various benefactors of Harvard in its early days, wrote down seven names as follows: Benefactors to the first ffont of Letters for printing in Cambridge. Their names collected p L H 1674 Major Thomas Clark Capt James Oliver Capt Allen Capt Lake Mr Stoddard ffreake Hues 1 At a different time, but during his twenty-seven months as President, Hoar collected and entered the following information: Mr Joss: Glover gave to the Colledge a ffont of printing Letters. Some Gentlemen of Amsterdam gave towards the furnishing of a Printing-Press with Letters gave [sic] fourty nine pound &amp; something more. 2 The purpose of this note is to correct a widely-accepted legend that identifies the seven names on the list made by Hoar with the "Gentlemen of Amsterdam." Both of Hoar's entries were printed by Thomas in 1810, but Roden seems to have been the first to make this identification with a misleading passage in his Cambridge Press (1905), pp. 10-11: At his [Glover's] own expense he provided a font of type and procured funds from friends in England and Holland for a complete printing establishment, '£49 and something more' being donated by seven men whose names were collected by Leonard Hoar in 1674: Major Thomas Clarke, Captain James Oliver, Captain Allen, Captain Lake, Mr. Stoddard, Mr. Freake, and Mr. Hues. An examination of the actual information as preserved in the manuscript records at Harvard shows that Roden came to the wrong conclusion. The list of names and the entry about the benefactors of Amsterdam are not even preserved in the same volume of records; thus there is no physical connection between these two scraps of information, and the sum of £49 is wrongly associated with the seven English names. G. P. Winship has helped to perpetuate this false identification, first in an article in 1938 3 and again in a further consideration of the Cambridge Press in 1939. 4 Finally, in 1945, when Mr. Winship wrote his extensive monograph on the Cambridge Press, he printed the two excerpts from the early Harvard records and then wrote the following: The two entries made at different times must refer to the same gift, and this gift must have been made before a press was set up in the colony. . . . There are circumstances which render an Amsterdam contribution toward a New England venture at the time explicable. . . . Holland had long been the principal purveyor of type and supplies to English printers. The Dutch ports were the most frequented commercial centers of northern Europe, and their normal trading advantages were strengthened for English merchants by the large numbers of disaffected fellow countrymen who were living in the Low Countries. Taking these factors into account it would not be surprising if a group of shipmasters and supercargoes engaged in the Massachusetts Bay trade, happening to sit together of an evening, agreed that it might be a profitable speculation to help to establish a printing shop overseas where the illicit Puritan printing that was being suppressed in Holland could be done without danger of interference. Circumstances can be imagined which might have led such a group to contribute generously to such a proposal. 5 Although thus conjecturally connected by Winship, there is nothing implicit in the entries to suggest that the seven names might be identified as the gentlemen of Amsterdam. Furthermore, none of the scholars who have written about the Cambridge Press seem to have investigated the list to see if the names may not be identifiable. Actually, such an investigation provides proof that the names are not those of the gentlemen of Amsterdam. Instead, at least four of them can be positively identified as residents of New England many years after the printing house at Cambridge was established. Major Thomas Clark was actually an Overseer of Harvard College during Hoar's administration; 6 Captain James Oliver was a resident of Massachusetts and had given money to Harvard about twenty years before Hoar recorded his name; 7 Mr. Stoddard was both an Overseer of the College and its Librarian: he had not yet been born when the Cambridge Press was founded. 8 There was a Captain John Allen who lived in Massachusetts at this time, although identification of him as a benefactor of Harvard College cannot be definite. 9 Mr. Freake cannot be positively identified, although two English brothers, Ralph and John Freck, are known to have given books to the Harvard Library not long before Hoar's administration. 10 Lake and Hues do not seem to appear in early Massachusetts records. There seems no doubt, then, that in light of this information all previous speculations that Hoar's two entries refer to the same gift are erroneous.

Samuel E. Morison in his Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century (1936), I, 285-86, mentions gifts of both of these brothers to the Harvard Library. Ralph gave the College, Bryan Walton's Polyglot in nine languages (6 vols., London, 1655-57) which was one of the proudest possessions of the early Harvard Library. In 1667 the College sent him in return a copy of the first edition of Eliot's Indian Bible, which was inscribed in part to him as 'a Noble benefator [sic] to the abouesayd Colledge.' Ralph Freck passed the copy on to the Bodleian (both Frecks were Oxford graduates) where it is still preserved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCOTCH TYPE IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AMERICA 1 by John Alden To this day the question of who first cast type in America remains unsettled. Although the claims in behalf of Abel Buell, of Connecticut, are the strongest, there remains an element of doubt. 2 That we cannot be certain is due largely to a statement in the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News-Letter for September 7, 1769, that "Printing Types are also made by Mr. Mitchelson of . . . [Boston] equal to any imported from Great-Britain." This casual remark seems destined to cast a lengthening shadow over the problem of Buell's priority. It is given further weight by the statement made by Isaiah Thomas in his History of Printing in America that "An attempt was made to establish a foundry for casting types in Boston about 1768, by a Mr. Mitchelson from Scotland, but he did not succeed." The "Mr. Mitchelson" of the Massachusetts Gazette and of Isaiah Thomas has been plausibly identified by Mr. Lawrence Wroth as David Mitchelson, who had arrived in Boston from Scotland in October, 1764. He was a member of the religious sect called Sandemanians, the leader of which, Robert Sandeman, came to America at the same time. By trade he was a goldsmith and lapidary—like Gutenberg, and like Abel Buell as well—and thereby qualified, at least by precedent, to turn his skill to casting type. In discussing Mitchelson's possible merits as a type founder, in the appendix to his Abel Buell of Connecticut , Mr. Wroth suggests that Mitchelson was working in co-operation with John Mein, the Boston bookseller and partner in the printing shop of Mein and Fleeming. 3 That Wroth does so is on the basis of a letter from Benjamin Gale to Ezra Stiles of April 1, 1769, where Gale writes, "However as Buel is jealous of his being intercepted by Mein you will not mention Bismuths entring that Composition." The context implies that Mein, like Buell, was interested in the founding of type, and Mr. Wroth is able to assume that Mein was linked with Mitchelson's activities. The conjunction is a reasonable one. Mein and Mitchelson were probably acquainted, for they apparently were fellow-passengers aboard the shop George and James which brought Mein to America. That Mein was also a Sandemanian is not known, but a member of the Sandeman family was a partner in the first shop he set up in Boston. His subsequent partner, John Fleeming, had also come to New England earlier in 1764, and had, with William McAlpine, printed Some Thoughts on Christianity , the first work by Robert Sandeman to be published in America. But can we, even so, find any evidence that Mitchelson did cast type, to substantiate his reported efforts? And are we justified in connecting him with John Mein? Before Mein set up his shop with John Fleeming he apparently employed William McAlpine to do his printing. Early in 1767 he and Fleeming began to issue works with a joint imprint which are distinctive in a curious bold-face roman type so unusual as to make its presence valid evidence of Mein and Fleeming printing even when their imprint does not appear on the title-page. 4 As a type face it is a prototype of that which became so popular in the early nineteenth century, when it came to be known in the printing trade as "Scotch" type. The need for accounting for the Mein and Fleeming type is perhaps the strongest support for Mitchelson's actual activity as a type founder and for linking him to John Mein that exists. For if Mitchelson did not cast the type, who did? Although Mr. Wroth has noted the use of this bold-face roman only in Boston at a slightly later period (when the type may have come from Fleeming's possession after Mein's departure for England late in 1769), and by John Carter in Providence, it does occur in other printing of the 1770's. For instance, John Howe, the printer set up by the British forces in Newport during their occupation of the town, possessed a supply, probably brought from Boston. More significant is the fact that Alexander Purdie, of Williamsburg, like-wise employed it in his Virginia Gazette and elsewhere, such as the title-page of The Proceedings of the Convention of Delegates . . . the 6th of May , 1776. 5 John Dunlap, of Philadelphia, is also known to have used it. Despite the fact that Dunlap came from northern Ireland (which was, none the less, culturally and economically related to Scotland), it is noteworthy that Alexander Purdie, like both Mein and Fleeming, was a Scotchman. If our bold-face roman type was not cast in America, it is probable that it came from Scotland, as suggested by the popular name given to its descendants. According to Isaiah Thomas, Fleeming in 1766 had returned to Scotland to secure printing supplies: that these included type follows. A comprehensive examination of Scottish books of the period has not been feasible, but it may be noted that the first edition of the Encyclopœdia Britannica , the publication of which was completed in 1771, is in the same bold-face roman. Scattered instances of its use are found in other British works such as William Woty's Poetical Works (London, G. Scott, 1770), and for the text of John Tait's Poetical Legends (London, J. Donaldson, 1775). That the printer of the latter, John Donaldson, was a Scotchman may be deduced on the basis of his name alone; but before moving to London he had in fact been a printer in Edinburgh. On the other hand, the London, 1767, edition of Tissot's Advice to the People , cited by Mr. Wroth as an English use of the type, proves to be an American edition with a false imprint. 6 In their Catalogue of Specimens of Printing Types (London, 1935), W. T. Berry and A. F. Johnson list no Scottish examples of the 1760's or 1770's other than those issued by Alexander Wilson. A comparison of Wilson's faces with the Mein and Fleeming types eliminates effectively any likelihood that Wilson produced the latter. During this period there was, however, another type founder in Scotland, a relatively obscure person named John Baine. Mr. George H. Bushnell, Librarian of St. Andrews University, is currently engaged on a biography of him, but as yet very little is known regarding Baine. At one time a partner of Alexander Wilson, Baine appears to have been active many years before the appearance of his first recorded type specimen book, A Specimen of Printing Types by John Baine &amp; Grandson &amp; Co. (Edinburgh, 1787). Of it a unique copy, which belonged to Isaiah Thomas, is preserved at the American Antiquarian Society. A comparison of Mein's type specimen sheet of ca. 1768 with the Baine types leaves no more than a perfunctory doubt that it was from Baine that Mein and Fleeming secured their type. The possibility that the Mein and Fleeming type may none the less have been cast in America from matrices supplied by Baine is largely disposed of by at least one strange phenomenon observed in printing done by their shop. In setting A Sermon Delivered July 31st, 1768 , by Sylvanus Conant (Boston, 1768), the compositor, probably following the author's copy, set the words "Lord" and "God" in large capitals throughout the work. Its theological nature, needless to say, gave frequent occasion for their appearance. A close examination of some of the capital O's reveals a slight deformity at the foot of the letter which on further scrutiny proves to be a vestige of the tail of a Q. The demand for capital O's for the words "Lord" and "God" may well have taxed the resources of the shop: in any event, the Q's were obviously cut down either for this or an earlier need. The same modified Q's will be found in the running titles of Mein's newspaper, the Boston Chronicle , which were kept as standing type during the early months of its career. Amusing as this is as a demonstration of the printer's ingenuity, its importance for us lies in the fact that, if matrices were available, to cast the needed O's would have been easier than to file off the tails of the Q's. Whatever the truth may be regarding the newspaper reference to Mitchelson, there is even less reason for linking him with the Scotch type of Mein and Fleeming, in face of a recognized source for it in the foundry of John Baine. It is perhaps wisest and safest to accept Isaiah Thomas's statement that in his efforts to set up a foundry Mitchelson did not succeed. If Mein were associated with him, then Mein had other more pressing problems on his hands, for the year 1769 found Mein engaged in political controversy which led to his being mobbed in the streets of Boston and to an ignominious flight to England. II. In attributing the Mein and Fleeming type to John Baine, a new pattern in American type history is made possible, a new continuity with British typography established. In his essay on "British Influences upon American Printing," recently published in his Typographic Heritage (1949), Mr. Wroth recognizes the rôle played by John Baine and his grandson in casting the type used by Thomas Dodson in printing Rees's Encyclopœdia , although the face used is a traditional face unlike the bold-face roman of Mein and Fleeming. Continuing, Mr. Wroth speaks of the work of Binny and Ronaldson of Philadelphia, the first type founders to achieve significant and lasting stature in America. Both were Scotchmen, and in the partnership it was Binny who contributed the knowledge of printing and of punch cutting. Although they began business in 1797 their first specimen book of types did not appear until 1812. Of the two distinct faces displayed, the first was a transitional letter which, recast in recent times, has been named "Oxford," and, even more recently, has been recut by the Linotype Company as "Monticello." The other face cast by Binny and Ronaldson is one which, in Stanley Morison's words, is a "fat grotesque," one of the "bold, bad faces" which none the less achieved great popularity. But in speaking at some length of this face Mr. Wroth does not call attention to the fact that its resemblance to the Baine type is most remarkable. The obvious question arises: Was there any connection between Baine and his fellow Scots Binny and Ronaldson? The evidence for such a connection is at present inconclusive. The research in which Mr. P. J. Conkwright, of the Princeton University Press, is currently engaged concerning Binny and Ronaldson should ultimately clarify the matter. In the meantime we do know that Baine and his grandson came to Philadelphia around 1790, where shortly thereafter the elder man died. There is reason to believe that Binny was as a young man apprenticed to Baine, and the ledgers of the firm record that on June 12, 1799, J. Baine (presumably the grandson) sold to Binny and Ronaldson $300 worth of tools. What these tools included is not specified, but in the sale there is evidence of continuity. That the boldface Binny and Ronaldson type is a lineal descendant of the Baine face becomes a very real possibility. 7 III. As the innovator of the type known as "Scotch" John Baine's significance is consequently far greater than has been hitherto acknowledged in the history of typography, both in America and in Great Britain. As a result, the importance ascribed to Richard Austin and to Robert Thorne by A. F. Johnson, discussing the evolution of modern-face roman in his Type Designs (1934) should be reevaluated and reconsidered. Obscure as he may have been, to Baine should apparently be attributed the bold-face roman type which, unfortunately, makes so much early nineteenth-century printing hideous to our eyes.

      <field name="fulltext">THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CONSIDERS THE PUBLICATION OF A BIBLE, 1777 by William H. Gaines, Jr. The early summer of the third year of the Revolutionary War was a period of crisis for the struggling colonials. One British army under General Burgoyne had launched an invasion of New York State from Canada and, having conquered Ticonderoga, was moving down the Hudson towards Albany. Another, commanded by General Sir William Howe, was being herded aboard the troopships that were to take them from New York to the Head of Elk in Maryland, from which they were to march overland to the rebel capital at Philadelphia. In that city, the Continental Congress was busy with the varied complex of problems, military, diplomatic, and financial, that were all crying for attention and action. There, on the seventh of July, 1777, a petition from a group of Presbyterian clergymen was received, which called on the Congress to underwrite the printing of an edition of the Bible for the use of patriot families. This petition was sponsored by the Reverend Francis Allison, assistant pastor of the first Presbyterian church of Philadelphia; John Ewing, provost of the University of Pennsylvania; and William Marshall. These gentlemen were much concerned over the lack of Bibles in the colonies and the difficulty of importing them from abroad, and they apparently felt that a war for liberty could not be won by bullets alone. The petition 1 was immediately referred to a committee consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Daniel Roberdeau and Jonathan Bayard Smith of Philadelphia. 2 The petition, the original manuscript of which appears in the Papers of the Continental Congress, is printed here below for the first time: 1. As the Price of Bibles for the Use of Families and Schools is greatly advanced beyond what was formerly given for them, thro their Scarcity and Difficulty in importing them from Europe, it is highly expedient for Congress to order a common Bible to be printed under their Inspection for the Use of y e united States of America. 2. That as there are about 500,000 families in the united States, each standing in Need of one or more Bibles, many Thousand Copies of the holy Scriptures are immediately wanted and ought to be furnished at a moderate Price. 3. That as there are not Types in America to answer this Purpose, there should be a compleat Font, sufficient for setting the whole Bible at once, imported by Congress at the Public Expence, to be refunded in a stipulated Time by the Printer. 4. That in Order to prevent the Paper Makers from demanding an extravagant Price for the Paper, and retarding the Work by Breach of Contract or otherwise there should also be imported with the Types a few Reams of Paper, not exceeding a thousand, at the Beginning of the Work, to be paid for by the Printer in y e same Manner as y e Types are to be paid for. 5. That a Printer be employed, who shall undertake the Work at his own Risque &amp; Expence, giving a Mortgage on y e Font &amp; Printing Materials, with sufficient Personal Securities for his Fidelity, until the first Cost of y e Font, y e Paper, &amp; such Sums of Money as the Congress may think proper to advance to him for Dispatch of the Work, be refunded to the Public. 6. That in Order to render the Price of Binding as low as possible, the Congress order their Commissary General for Hides etc to deliver to the Printer at a moderate Price all the Sheep Skins furnished at y e Camp, to be tanned for this Purpose. 7. That the Printer be bound under sufficient Penalties to furnish Bibles to y e Public at a limited Price, not exceeding ten Shillings each, &amp; to prevent any Retailer, under him in the united States from asking an higher price on any Pretence whatsoever. 8. That, as the greatest Precaution is necessary to preserve the sacred Text uncorrupted &amp; free from Errors, an accurate &amp; skillful Corrector of the Press be employed at a proper Salary, to superintend the Impression, untill the whole Bible be composed: and then that the Frames be carefully locked up in proper Places prepared for y e Purpose, to guard against an accidental or designed Alteration of them, and to have them ready for constant Use to supply the Public Demand. 9. That the Printer on no Pretence whatsoever presume to strike off any Sheet of the Bible, untill the Corrector has examined a sufficient Number of Proofs &amp; judged it to be sufficiently accurate &amp; corrected: and that this Precaution be taken as often as any Frame is used after having been locked up for some Time past. 10. That y e most correct Copy of the Bible that can be found be delivered by y e Congress to the Printer, who shall be bound by solemn Oath not to vary from it knowingly in his Edition, even in a single Iota, without first laying the proposed Alteration before Congress &amp; obtaining their Approbation. 11. That the Corrector be bound by a similar Oath, to correct the Sheets according to that Copy. 12. That instead of the old Dedication to King James, a new Dedication to the Congress be drawn up &amp; prefixed to the Bible. 13. That instead of the Words, newly translated out of the original Tongues, &amp; By his Majesty's special Command , in the Title Page of our Bibles, it be said, translated from the original Tongues , and, Printed by Order of Congress . 14. That the Printer employed in the Work devote himself to this Business alone; &amp; that no other Printer in the united States be suffered to interfere with him in the Printing of that Form or Kind of a Bible, which he has undertaken. 15. That after the Bible is published, no more Bibles of that Kind be imported into the American States by any Person whatsoever. This was no ordinary printing job which Mr. Allison had proposed and of which Congress was expected to dispose. Up to 1777, there had been no complete English Bible printed in the colonies, and the English-speaking inhabitants depended on British presses for their copies of the Scriptures. There had been Bibles printed in the colonies, but these had been in non-English tongues and had been produced in relatively small numbers. Thus, as early as 1663, Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson of Cambridge, Massachusetts, had issued one such printed in the Maumee tongue, the lingua franca of the New England Indians. This was the famous and rare Eliot Bible, prepared by the Reverend John Eliot for the use of Congregationalist missionaries to the red heathens of Massachusetts. Then, in 1743, Christopher Saur, a Rhenish German printer settled in Germantown, Pa., issued a Bible in German, the first to be published in a European tongue in North America. Even Saur had had to use imported paper and type. However, another edition of the German Bible, which appeared in 1763, was the first to use American-made paper. Then, in 1776, Saur's son, also Christopher, published the first Bible to be printed from American-cast types. However, these were all limited editions, the Saur or German Bible, running only to 1200 copies, while the third or 1777 edition to only 3000. 3 The project now before Congress, on the other hand, called for 20,000 English Bibles to be run off by an American printer at a time when every resource was at least theoretically devoted to war production. However, the committee to which Mr. Allison's petition had been referred began studying the most practicable way of solving the problem, and before arriving at a solution turned to the printers of Philadelphia, inviting them to submit estimates and to give their advice on the best way to print 20,000 Bibles. This was quite natural, since at that time many of the competent printshops in the Confederation were located in that city. Of the other two colonial printing centers, New York was in the hands of the enemy, while Boston was many days' hard travel from the capital of the Confederation. At least five printers, all of them Pennsylvanians, submitted estimates in which every phase of the work, the cost of every piece of equipment and every material was quoted. One of those submitting bids was Robert Aitken 4 (1734-1806), a Quaker of Scotch birth, who was already established in his profession by his work as publisher of the Pennsylvania Magazine and of an edition of the New Testament. Figuring 24 pages to each sheet and the weight 5 of type necessary to print one sheet at 144 (6 per page), he estimated a total of 34 sheets (or 4896 wt) for the entire job, then added 600 additional weight of type to reach an estimated font of 5496 weight of type for the whole. Allowing a cost of 5 shillings per sheet or per 144 weight of type, Aitken set the cost of type alone at 1374 pounds. Although the specifications called for the use of nonpareil type, Aitken, feeling that this type would wear out sooner than brevier "being of smaller face," maintained that 200,000 6 Bibles could be run off from the latter, and submitted a sample sheet of the Bible printed in this type. The types, he thought, should be purchased at the foundry of Dr. Wilson in Glasgow, for these produced "the best metal and the neatest letter in Europe." Aitken made no suggestions, however, as to how the embattled colonies were to obtain this superior metal while Glasgow remained loyal to the Crown and while the British fleet maintained its blockade. As for paper, Aitken based his estimates on a total of 200,000 Bibles and called for 146,000 reams, 73 reams sufficing to print a thousand. Since the domestic product seemed adequate neither in quality nor quantity, he advised that this commodity be imported from Germany or France and allowed a cost of 15 shillings per ream or a total cost of 10,950 pounds. (At this rate, 20,000 would have cost 1095 pounds.) By way of fixed equipment, he felt 13 presses, one of which was to be used for running proofs, would be necessary. These like "penny pies" could be obtained for 10 pounds each in Glasgow, but for not less than 42 pounds in Pennsylvania. It is significant that he used the lower figure in totalling up his estimates. Chases, 84 of which were necessary, were obtainable for 3 pounds each in the colonies but could be had for only 15 shillings each in that paradise for impecunious printers, the loyal city of Glasgow. A labor force of 6 compositors and 24 printers (2 to a press) could complete the work, Aitken felt, in 20 months. Calculating from the price of leather then prevailing, he estimated the binding cost per volume at 4 shillings. Arriving at a total cost for the job of 33,281 pounds, 5 shillings and 4 pence (after allowing for a difference of 66-2/3 in the exchange price of all material imported from abroad), Aitken showed that the actual cost per Bible was only 3 shillings 4 pence apiece. Another printer who submitted a bid on the job was Thomas Bradford (1745-1838), son of "the patriot printer," William Bradford, and co-publisher with him of the Pennsylvania Journal . 7 He submitted two sets of estimates, one for printing 20,000 Bibles and one for 30,000. For the former number, he estimated that 1100 reams of paper would be sufficient, whereas 2000 reams would be necessary for an edition of 30,000 copies. Bradford, like the other printers, was acutely aware of the paper shortages within the colonies and advised that that commodity be imported from either France or Holland, where it was obtainable for 6 to 8 shillings the ream, and expressed a preference for the Dutch product. His type estimates, which he based on a Bible of 45 sheets, each taking a font of 200, allowed for imperfections and deterioration, for he called for a font of 10,000 weight. He estimated that 8 hands could complete the job in 6 months, and he fixed the expenses of composition at 14 pounds per sheet and press costs at 20 pounds. Apart from his estimates and possibly looking to his own interests in the event that the Congress should award him the contract, Bradford recommended that no Bibles be imported, once the Congressional edition was completed, for ten to fifteen years. He was the only one of the five printers to make this suggestion specifically. The founder of the Pennsylvania Packet and the man who had printed the Declaration of Independence, John Dunlap, also entered the competition on July 10, 1777. 8 Dunlap estimated that 300 pounds of type would be necessary to set one sheet, but pointed out that it would be desirable to obtain a total of 8000 weight to set all sheets at once, since the types were so small and delicate that they would be worn out "if frequently worked." Paper, which might formerly have been purchased from Great Britain at 10 shillings per ream, posed a problem. Dunlap hoped that if enough could be imported to begin the job, he would be able to get the remaining stock made in Pennsylvania. The cost of paper and type was estimated by him at 4000 pounds sterling, and he allowed $500 for labor. Binding would cost 4 shillings per volume. Another printer who submitted estimates on the Congressional Bible was Henry Miller (1702-1782), native of Waldeck, Germany, and publisher of the Wochentliche Philadelphische Staatsbote . 9 Allowing a font of 156 weight for each sheet and figuring that 35 sheets would be necessary for the work, Miller stipulated a total type weight of 5460, but allowed an additional 1360 to allow for errors. He estimated that the type alone would cost 1687 pounds 10 shillings, and pointed out that types of good metal and having the proper depth would be sufficient for two impressions of 10,000 copies each. While making no estimate of the quantity or cost of paper needed, the German felt that it should be made by master workmen in that craft, "which will hardly be possible in this Country at this present time." Pointing out that the number of printers and compositors would have to be fixed "and their attendance assured" before an estimate could be made on the time to finish the job, he guessed that it could not be done in much less than a year. As leather was not to be had, he refrained from making any estimate of binding costs. The last of the Philadelphia group submitting bids was William Sellers (1725?-1804), who had served his apprenticeship in London before he set up his shop in Philadelphia in 1764 and who with David Hall had published the Pennsylvania Gazette . 10 Sellers figured on a total font of 6000 weight, which would cost about 1500 pounds sterling. If these were cut "clear and deep," he felt that they would suffice for two impressions of 10,000 copies each, but a third impression from the same type could not be expected to be as satisfactory. Calling for approximately 1500 reams of paper, he found no satisfactory supply existing in the United States, and thereby implied the need for importation. As to the time element, Sellers thought that two compositors might set the whole in nine months, and that two presses could run off 10,000 copies in the same length of time. The committee considered these propositions for a little better than two months before it reported to the Congress. In that interval, the military developments had been sufficiently disastrous to the American cause that all but the most urgent business was delayed. By the 25th of August, "Blue Billy" Howe's expeditionary force had established a beachhead at the Head of Elk in Maryland and was deploying for a strike at Philadelphia itself. By the tenth of September, that army had defeated Washington's at the Battle of the Brandywine, and only the Schuylkill river stood between the invaders and the capital of the Confederation. In the north, the news was not so bad, but it was bad enough. Burgoyne had advanced almost to the junction of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, and though both his right and left wings had been defeated, he was still in a position to capture Albany and to seize the Hudson Valley for the Crown. Benedict Arnold and Daniel Morgan were to annihilate this threat at the battle of Bemis's Heights in late September, but at the time it seemed very likely that Gentleman Johnny's reckless stroke would succeed. Thus, on the eleventh of September, Mr. Adams, Mr. Roberdeau, and Mr. Smith submitted their report on Mr. Allison's petition to a Congress that undoubtedly was more concerned with the military situation, particularly the one on its own doorstep. The committee, tacitly considering the advice of the Philadelphia printers, but also, it must seem, influenced by the nearness of Blue Billy's veterans, reported unfavorably on the project. Noting that "the proper types . . . are not to be had in this country" and that "the paper cannot be procured but with such difficulties and subject to such casualties as render any dependance on it altogether improper," the committee's report dwelt on "the risque of importing them" and on the uncertainty of any calculations of expenses "in the present state of affairs." Thus, they recommended that no attempt be made to import these materials. Recognizing, however, that "the use of the Bible is so universal and its importance so great," they recommended also that the Committee of Commerce be ordered to import the 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland "or elsewhere." A motion to this effect was approved with all four New England states, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Georgia supporting the measure, while New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and both Carolinas opposed it. The resolution being read a second time, final action was put off until the nineteenth. 11 Before that date, however, the body was concerned almost exclusively in finding enough reenforcements to stop Howe and save Philadelphia. On the eighteenth, the emperilled legislators discreetly resolved to adjourn their deliberations to the more restful atmosphere of Lancaster. Two days later, General Charles Grey surprised the usually vigilant Anthony Wayne in his bivouac at Paoli; Howe slipped across the Schuylkill with his main body; and on Friday, the twenty-sixth of September, the British marched into the erstwhile Continental capital. The government in exile at Lancaster returned to Philadelphia the following summer, but it did not resume the Bible project until 1782. In that year, the Quaker printer, Robert Aitken, working under Congressional auspices, produced the first complete Bible printed in English in the New World. 12 But by then, Philadelphia had been four years restored to American rule, France had recognized the independence of the revolted colonies, and Yorktown had been fought and won. The new nation, though far from being out of the political or financial woods, no longer had a well-armed hostile army on the outskirts of its capital. A printing project, which the exigencies of war and invasion had made impractical and relatively unimportant, became attainable within a year after Cornwallis' surrender.

      <field name="fulltext">THE SEVERAL STATES OF THE FARRER MAP OF VIRGINIA * by Coolie Verner The Huth Catalogue 1 in 1880 described two different states of the 1651 Farrer Map of Virginia, and Col. Lawrence Martin in 1936 2 further distinguished a total of four states. There is, however, a copy of the map in the Huntington Library which was pulled from an earlier state of the plate than any previously described. It can be distinguished from the earliest of Col. Martin's states by the absence of the words "Fort Orang." on the right border above "Septen." There is no other difference. It is not often enough emphasized that 17th-and 18th-century map plates had an active life expectancy of well over a decade. The Jefferys' plates for the 18th-century Fry &amp; Jefferson Map of Virginia were, for example, in use for at least 21 years; moreover, additions were made to the plates after Jefferys' death. The Farrer Map has peculiar interest as showing the survival of two related but inaccurate geographical beliefs: a northwest passage through the North American land mass; and the close proximity of the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Although in general the Farrer Map is derived from the more important and more accurate 1646-7 Dudley Map of Virginia, 3 it nevertheless has a significance of its own in that it places for the first time on any known map the names of the original shires: Henrico City, Charles City, Elizabeth City; and Anandale County, Maryland. For historical as well as bibliographical reasons, therefore, it is worth recording with some care the additions to the plate, with their probable dates. The map was first engraved by John Goddard for Stephenson's 3rd edition, 1651, of Edward Williams' Virgo Triumphans , which announced the addition of the map on its titlepage. This 3rd edition is, however, known only by an inserted titlepage in the Huth copy of the 2nd edition. Stephenson also apparently added the map to some copies of another of his 1651 publications, Edward Bland's The Discovery of New Brittaine , its relevance to which was, however, only approximate, since Bland's explorations were southwest of the chief placename locations on the Farrer map. Copies of the two works in question have been so long sought for by collectors of Americana and have so often been sophisticated by dealers and binders, that it is no longer possible to speak with precision about occurrences of the map with either book. It is, however, assumed from available evidence that 1) Copies of the first and second editions of Williams which contain the map are either late gathered copies or sophisticated ones. 2) Any of the first four states of the map (see below) might properly be found with the 3rd edition of Williams, and the 3rd edition would be incomplete without one of them. 3) The copies of the Bland with the Farrer map are accidental, or special copies, or sophisticated ones. 4) The plate was obtained by Overton from Stephenson or his successors, and was used by him under his own imprint for separately issued (or Atlas bound) copies of the map. The assignment of the date 1667? to the final state of the plate is based on indirect evidence in Plomer 4 and on the fact that after 1668 the Term Catalogues carry notices of Overton's publications with a different imprint address. Following are the known states of the plate, with sufficient descriptive information concerning the changes for the recognition of other possible variants. Location symbols are for copies examined in photostat: 1650 [AN UNTITLED MANUSCRIPT DRAFT] Said to have been Farrer's own draft for the engraving.

      <field name="fulltext">POE'S ALONE: ITS BACKGROUND, SOURCE, AND MANUSCRIPT by I. B. Cauthen, Jr. The lines entitled "Alone," first published in 1875, twenty-six years after Poe's death, have been generally accepted by his editors as an early Poe poem. 1 Various details concerning the background of this poem and bearing on its attribution to Poe have not previously been known, for the correspondence of John Ingram, the English biographer of Poe, seems never to have been examined for the light it throws on the poem. 2 In addition to discussing the prepublication background of "Alone" and the source from which the poem is derived, this paper will present information concerning the manuscript of the poem which only recently has been definitely located. The poem was first published in Scribner's Magazine for September, 1875, with a prefatory note by Eugene L. Didier, who claimed to have found the poem "in the album of a lady of distinguished social position." 3 The poem is reproduced in what Didier calls "fac-simile," but very likely it is a reproduction either by wood-cut or zinc-plate; this is different in several ways from modern facsimile processes since the hand of the engraver intervenes between the document and its printed reproduction. 4 Nearly a year before the poem's publication, Didier had offered Ingram on the first of October, 1874, a transcript of this poem for $100, along with other information he had been collecting for "five or six years . . . for a correct life of Poe." Concerning "Alone," Didier wrote, "I have in my possession a M. S. poem of Poe's which has never been printed. Poe wrote it in a lady's Album in this city [Baltimore], from which I copied it. It is dated March 17, 1829, and signed E. A. Poe. This will be very valuable to you." 5 Ingram appears to have been interested enough in this writer and the materials he offered to write to a Baltimore friend for details about Didier. For, on May 17, 1875, John Parker, an assistant in the Peabody Institute Library, wrote Ingram that Didier was "a magazine writer, who had been collecting and writing in regard to Poe for some years, but from what I hear of him I do not believe he would impart much knowledge." 6 Two months later Parker was able to send Ingram a copy of this poem under rather strange circumstances: I send you two photographic copies of a poem which bears Poe's name and which I have never seen before. I obtained them quite accidentally. A gentleman, who is doing some work for our librarian, has invented a new style of photography, and one day about a month ago one of his assistants brought up to the library some samples of this new mode of photographing manuscripts &amp;c and among these samples was this poem. As soon after this as I was able I obtained some copies of it and also made enquiries as to where they had seen this poem. All the information I could get was that they had photographed it from the autograph album of some gentleman whose name they did not remember. They also said that the page whereon it was written was very yellow with age and that the writing had almost faded away. 7 Ingram probably had his doubts of the poem's authenticity and must have asked Parker for further details; thus, in December, after the poem had appeared in the September Scribner's , Parker wrote: From the photographer of the poem I learnt the following items. Mr. Didier borrowed the album containing the poem from its owner and brought it to him to have some copies photographed. He kept several copies for himself, some of which I sent you. He says he photographed directly from the album which was a very old one. Mr. Didier refused to give me the name of the owner of the album and insisted that it was Poe's writing. He was rather indignant when I suggested to him in a note that it might possibly be a copy of Poe's writing. 8 Later, in an essay on the Virginia Edition of Poe's Works , Didier himself gives us an important piece of information concerning these lines. Again claiming the poem to be a genuine one, although Professor Harrison had classed it under "Attributed Poems," Didier declared, I discovered it in the autograph album of Mrs. Balderston, the wife of Judge Balderston, formerly Chief Judge of the Orphan's Court in Baltimore. I had it engraved and published in Scribner's Monthly . I gave the poem the name of "Alone," and dated it, as it had neither name nor date, but the poem and signature as published in the magazine are an exact fac simile of the writing in the album. 9 Thus, although the poem purported to be in Poe's handwriting, Didier admitted that he added a title and a date to the manuscript. The title has been retained by Poe's editors, but the date has been suspect. Although Didier had implied to Ingram that the dating of the poem, "Baltimore, March 17, 1829." was in Poe's hand, actually it was his own handwriting. This fictitious date has not been accepted by editors: indeed, the chronology of Poe's life does not allow acceptance. After the funeral in Richmond of Mrs. Allen, Poe's foster mother, Poe had returned to Fortress Monroe by March 10, 1829, and presumably was there until his discharge from the army on April 15, 1829. Although it is possible that he could have visited Baltimore sometime in that month before his discharge from the army, a letter from Baltimore, May 20, 1829, seems to indicate that he had but recently arrived. 10 The handwriting of the poem as it appears in the reproduction in Scribner's has sometimes been doubted by Poe's editors and friends. For instance, Mrs. Whitman, the "Seeress of Providence," was outraged by "so audacious and so palpable a forgery." Nevertheless, she saw that the poem might after all be Poe's: I think that the poem might readily be accepted as genuine. If it had been in Poe's writing I should not have questioned it even without signature. . . . Still, the poem may be his, but if so why was it not given in his own handwriting. 11 Although there are many difficulties in determining the authenticity of the handwriting with only the reproduction in Scribner's as a basis, it is now possible to examine the original of the poem, which only recently has been definitely located. 12 It is written in an early nineteenth-century autograph album, 12.5 by 20.5 centimeters, bound in red morocco with gold and black stampings; on the spine in the lettering in gilt, "ALBUM." Its pages are numbered in script, the odd numbers on the recto, the even on the verso, from 1 to 258. Some of the leaves bear the watermark, inverted, with the outline letters "S &amp;A Butler / U S" 13 at the fold near the bottom of the sheet. The paper, which is of the "wove" type, appears to be fully consistent throughout the album. There are seventy-six poems in the album, many of them bearing datelines; these dates range from August 1, 1826 (p. 15) to October 7, 1848 (p. 99). Many of the poems bear signatures as well: one is signed by Lucy Holmes, the original owner of the album; another signature is that of I. Balderston, who married Miss Holmes. In addition to members of the Balderston and Holmes families, several of the other writers can be identified. 14 The poem that is of the greatest interest in the album is that signed "E. A. Poe" (p. 55). It is headed "Original" and bears no date-line. Yet traces of the title "Alone" and the date-line which Didier admitted that he added can be seen, for they appear to have been carelessly erased from pencilling. The traces left, however, are sufficient to indicate that the writing is that of Didier, and that this is the manuscript that he had photographed and from which he was working for the Scribner's publication. Of almost equal interest is a poem, p. 51, headed in this way: "by W. H. Poe—copied at his / request by E. A. Poe—" 15 Although there is a slight difference in appearance in the handwriting of this poem and Poe's own poem, it is very probable that they were written by the same person. Especially the formation of short words like my and in , the long pendulums on certain letters, the general cursory nature of the script, and the characteristic of crossing the "t" some distance after the letter itself lead me to believe they are in the same hand. From several pieces of evidence it appears that these are genuine Poe manuscripts. First, there are no blank rectos of leaves in the first hundred pages of the album except in one instance where a poem is written on the verso following (p. 48). It seems rather improbable, then, that two leaves, p. 51 and p. 55, would be left blank (to be utilized by a forger) in this rather full first section; the leaving of these rectos blank here would be more than chance. The latest poem in the album (p. 99), dated October 7, 1848, may indicate that there were no blank rectos suitable for autograph in this first section at that time; otherwise, the writer here would have utilized them. His alternative was to turn to the back of the album where there are many blank leaves, but he seemed to have wanted his poem as near the first of the album as possible, and therefore he may have taken the first blank recto he came to. Two other items may be mentioned to authenticate the poems: both pages 51 and 55 are conjugate to their gathering, and there is no evidence of any kind of insertion of these two leaves. The stitching is plainly evident, and it has not been tampered with. The other item is a drawing, p. 258, the last page of the album, of a series of visiting cards bearing the names of writers in the album. These are the work of a skilled penman, and the cards are in contemporary styles of engraved cards. Among these cards is the name of "E. A. Poe." The ink used seems to be of the same age throughout this page, and the addition of Poe's name at a later date might be indicated by a difference in ink, which is not present. There is every indication that this card was drawn with the others. But the most conclusive evidence rests on the handwriting, which examination shows to be the same in the two poems. It would seem an unnecessary and almost unbelievable forgery to head a poem "by W. H. Poe copied . . . by E. A. Poe," since it would clearly be more advantageous for a forger to give us another poem by Edgar Poe. But this problem is subordinate to the handwriting of the poem "Alone." The signature of Poe on both poems is very similar to those of the Poe letters to John Allan in 1829 and 1830, which Mrs. Whitman and Ingram did not know; their conclusion that the poem was not in Poe's handwriting was very likely based on the Poe script that they knew, which was some years later than the presumed date of this poem. The handwriting within the poems, aside from headings and signatures, has been carefully examined for me by several specialists. Especially, Mr. Robert W. Hill, Keeper of Manuscripts, The New York Public Library, has very generously examined this poem and compared it with Poe letters particularly of the years 1829 and 1835. He has written that while this examination has been hindered by the necessity of comparing letters against poem , "nevertheless, there are common characteristics in both: the 'th,' the long pendulums of the 'f,' 'g,' and the 'y' and the beginning strokes of the 'm' and 'n.'" He summarizes his examination by stating that, "An examination of the photostats which have been furnished me and which have been made from the autograph album described in this paper leads me to lean toward acceptance of the poem as being in the handwriting of Poe." 16 Thus this poem which has been long suspect because of the method of first publication and the temporary disappearance of this album now seems to be authenticated, and may be accepted as a genuine Poe manuscript. Poe's editors have generally agreed that, as Killis Campbell describes it, the poem "is clearly in Poe's early manner." 17 The tone of the poem is certainly not that of the mature poet, but it contains many resemblances to his early work. As Swinburne wrote Ingram, the verses "seemed to me not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them." 18 Indeed, the lines are particularly infused, as we shall see, with a reflection of Byronism that is very common in the early poems. It is likely that Poe had "read all of Byron's poems, and that he had read and re-read many of them"; 19 this early reading obviously influenced Poe's earliest volumes, and "Alone" shares a kinship with those early volumes because of the strong Byronic element common to all of them. While the mere presence of a Byronic influence does not guarantee the authenticity of "Alone," it strengthens the claim that this is a genuine Poe poem. It has not hitherto been pointed out that the first nineteen lines of "Alone" are derived from Byron's Manfred , II, ii, 50-75, although the last three lines are a Poësque conclusion using only a slight hint from Byron. A comparison of Poe's lines and the passage from Manfred shows clearly the strong similarity of the two. Both "Alone" and the speech of Manfred are autobiographical. Both begin with a similar phrase, and both put an emphasis on the act of seeing. Manfred declares: From my youth upwards, My Spirit walked not with the souls of men, Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes. (ll. 50-52) Poe writes: From childhood's hour I have not been As others were—I have not seen As others saw. Both poets continue in the description of their isolation from humanity. In Byron it is, The thirst of their ambition was not mine, The aim of their existence was not mine; My joys— my griefs— my passions— and my powers, Made me a stranger; though I wore the form, I had no sympathy with breathing flesh. (ll. 53-57) This difference in the poet's passions from those of the common man is reemphasized in Poe: I could not bring My passions from a common spring— From the same source I have not taken My sorrow— I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone— And all I lov'd— I lov'd alone. This is the same sense of isolation that Byron expresses in . . . with men, and with the thoughts of men, I held but slight communion. (II. 60-61) Byron, for dramatic foreshadowing, mentions the "One" who, as Manfred later explains, has been destroyed by heart and not by hand. Poe does not reflect these two lines, but begins a description, following Byron, of the mystery which binds him, a Byronic love of nature. The elements that the two poets mention are similar, Poe's "red cliff of the mountain," Byron's "iced mountain top," Poe's "the torrent, or the fountain," Byron's, to plunge Into the torrent, and to roll along On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow. (II. 65-68) Byron's "the moving moon, / The stars and their development," becomes in in Poe "the sun that 'round me roll'd / In its autumn tint of gold." Byron's "the dazzling lightnings" is Poe's "the lightning in the sky / As it passed me flying by—." Byron's "the scattered leaves" and "Autumn winds . . . at their evening song" is compressed by Poe to "the thunder and the storm." Poe's conclusion, . . . the cloud that took the form (When the rest of Heaven was blue) Of a demon in my view, is not directly derived from the passage in Manfred but was perhaps suggested by the Witch of the Alps to whom Manfred had spoken the lines of autobiography. Here again it appears that Poe was familiar with Byron's writings and did not hesitate to rely on them for ideas. It would be interesting to know if Poe composed these lines on the spur of the moment for Mrs. Balderston's album. If he did, the performance shows a remarkable memory for his reading and an admiration for this particular passage in Byron. But, of course, it is possible that he had composed the lines some time before and that he took the opportunity of a proffered album to set them down. Although he was probably satisfied in the suitability of his paraphrase for a lady's album, he was not proud enough of its to include it in his later volume of poems. Notes 1 The following editors accept these lines as genuine: Richard Henry Stoddard, The Works of Edgar Allan Poe (Amontillado Edition, 1884), I, 35, 430; Edmund Clarence Stedman and George Edward Woodberry, The Works of Edgar Allan Poe (1895), X, 138, 237; R. Brimley Johnson, The Complete Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe (1909), 143; J. H. Whitty, The Complete Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (1911), 135, 283; Thomas Ollive Mabbott, Selected Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (1928), 93. For the comments of James A. Harrison, see The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe (1902), VII, 227, and XVI, 378. Killis Campbell, in The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (1917), 299, places it under "Poems Attributed to Poe," but he adds in a note that "the poem is clearly in Poe's early manner." The poem is not included in Arthur Hobson Quinn and Edward H. O'Neill, The Complete Poems and Stories of Edgar Allan Poe (1946). 2 The Ingram correspondence, purchased after the removal of some of its more valuable letters, is now in the manuscript holdings of the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia. The letters cited in this paper are from that collection. 3 Scribner's Magazine , X (September, 1875), 608. 4 For this information I am grateful to Mr. Rollo G. Silver, Peabody Institute Library. In a private communication, October 21, 1949, he writes that, because of the use of the word "fac-simile" by Didier, "we may be sure that photography was employed." Ringwalt's American Encyclopedia of Printing (1871), states that "wood-engraving, which, as applied to printing purposes, precedes all others, still holds a front rank for popular purposes; and its utility has been immensely increased during the present century by the readiness and certainty with which perfect copies of an engraved block can be electrotyped, and the rapidity with which impression can be made on machine presses." (p. 158). It is also pointed out that "designs can readilv be photographed on wood for the use of the engraver" (p. 348) and, furthermore, on the same page, he states that "various attempts have been made to produce cuts capable of being printed on typographic presses without the aid of an engraver." Later (p. 506) he notes that zinc plates are "specifically useful when only small editions are required." As Mr. Silver writes, "we can arrive at the conclusion that the manuscript was printed from a plate which may have been made from a wood-cut or from a zinc-plate. The consensus of opinion in these parts is that no one person can be sure of identifying the method employed." It must be pointed out that, while modern facsimiles do not employ a human element, this Scribner's plate most likely had the engraver's hand between the photograph that Didier submitted and the final, published plate. Thus handwriting characteristics might be slightly modified, and certain irregular formations that might partake of the appearance of forgery could very well be incorporated. 5 ALS, Didier to Ingram, October 1, 1874. 6 ALS, Parker to Ingram, May 17, 1875. 7 ALS, Parker to Ingram, July 7, 1875. There is no record in the files of the Peabody Institute Library of "a new style of photography" having been invented at that time. For this and other information about Baltimoreans connected with this poem, I am again grateful to Mr. Rollo G. Silver, Peabody Institute Library. These photographs are not at present in the Ingram collection, nor is there any record of their receipt. 8 ALS, Parker to Ingram, December 13, 1875. 9 The Poe Cult and Other Papers (1909), p. 270. Judge Isaiah Balderston (1806-1883) was a non-practicing dentist of Baltimore who was Chief Judge of the Orphans' Court from 1867 to 1871. He married Lucy Holmes, daughter of Dr. Oliver Holmes, surgeon-dentist. 10 Letter 11 from Poe to John Allan, The Letters of Edgar Allan Poe , edited by John Ward Ostrom (1948), I, 16-17. 11 ALS, Mrs. Whitman to Ingram, September 28, 1875. Ingram also commented on his copy of the poem, clipped from Scribner's , "not Poe's calligraphy." 12 The album in which Poe presumably wrote the poem was described, as pointed out above, by Didier on several occasions. However, Poe editors—not having traced the album itself— have been content perforce to use the Scribner's reproduction as a basis for the poem. After many fruitless searches, the album now has been located as the property of Mrs. E. H. Welbourn of Cantonsville, Maryland, a granddaughter of the original owner. It is through the generosity of Mrs. Welbourn that I am able to describe this album and the manuscripts it contains. 13 Mr. Dard Hunter of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has kindly written to me of the history of this firm: it was established in Suffield, Hartford County, Connecticut, by Asa Butler and his brother Simeon, in 1816. In 1819 they received the first government contract for supplying paper to the United States Senate, which before this time had used foreign-made papers. The firm went through several hands, and in 1877 the old "Eagle Mill" of the Butler firm was destroyed by fire. 14 For example, one of the writers is Franklin James Didier (1794-1840), a Baltimore physician-author, the father of Eugene Didier. 15 This poem was noted by T. O. Mabbott, "Poems by W. H. Poe" N &amp; Q , CLXII (May 21, 1932), 369, as having been first published in No Name Magazine , Baltimore, August 1890, I, no. 11, by E. L. Didier. In the album ms. the only variants are some slight differences in punctuation from the text Mr. Mabbott printed from the magazine. 16 Private communication to the writer, New York, May 25, 1950. 17 The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe , p. 299. 18 Letters of Algernon Charles Swinburne , edited by Sir Edmund Gosse and Thomas James Wise (Bonchurch Edition, 1927), XVIII, 134-135.

      <field name="fulltext">A SELECTIVE CHECK LIST OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SCHOLARSHIP FOR 1949 Part I: Incunabula and Early Renaissance, by Rudolph Hirsch Part II: Later Renaissance to the Present, by Lucy Clark and Fredson Bowers A CHECK list of the previous year's bibliographical scholarship will hereafter become a regular department in Studies in Bibliography . The present list is experimental: overlooked items will be cumulated in the 1950 compilation. The editor would appreciate copies of off-prints or collected publications containing material for listing, although reviews cannot be undertaken. Interested persons are invited to send references to books or articles which should appear here. This annual listing does not propose to treat the large number of enumerative catalogues which acquaint scholars with secondary publications in their field or assist libraries in the performance of their duties. Instead, the single attempt is made to bring together a selective account of primary investigations dealing with printing and publishing history, and bibliographical treatment of authors and their books, together with such critical or textual studies as are based on bibliographical evidence or the interpretation of basic documents. The claims of history have not been entirely excluded under these conditions; but in general the emphasis in Part II is placed on English and American literature. In Part I some few works on manuscripts are noted, but no attempt has been made to collect this material comprehensively. The compilers gratefully acknowledge a number of items suggested by Mr. Rollo Silver and Mr. John Wyllie.
