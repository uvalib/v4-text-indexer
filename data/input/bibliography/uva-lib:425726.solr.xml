      <field name="heading_text">A Sample Bibliographical Description With Commentary by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1949 Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description provided a new point of departure for descriptive bibliography by consolidating what had gone before, subjecting it to critical scrutiny, adding new points when necessary, and offering a detailed and carefully reasoned codification of procedure. He included in his book several examples of bibliographical descriptions, demonstrating his various recommendations in concrete form. In the nearly four decades since, a number of theoretical discussions of descriptive bibliography have been published, often extending or modifying the arguments of the Principles , though in no way detracting from its stature as the one indispensable statement in the field. They are in the nature of footnotes or postscripts to it. The extensions have had largely to do with the description of paper, type, and binding; and the modifications, especially in regard to the concepts of issue and state , result at least in part from taking more fully into account the conditions and products of nineteenth- and twentieth-century publishing. I think it may be a good idea at this time to bring together in one place references to these scattered discussions and to offer a new exemplary description that illustrates many of the points that have been made. I present below a bibliographical description of Melville's Redburn that attempts to show not only how a single edition might be described but also how one might combine with that description, as one ought to do in an author bibliography, the description of later editions, in order to form a complete publishing history of the work, down to the present. Previous sample descriptions have not gone beyond a single printing, but recent commentary has dealt not only with the techniques of description but also with those of classification and arrangement. Of course, one does have actual published bibliographies at hand as examples, and there are now many of them that make considerable advances over all but a few earlier efforts; but in the nature of things they all have their deficiencies. Although my own effort here inevitably has its deficiencies, too, it is accompanied (as an actual description is not likely to be) by a commentary that suggests, from time to time, other possible approaches. I have chosen Melville largely because I have a Melville bibliography in progress (in conjunction with the work on the Northwestern-Newberry Edition) but also in part because he is a nineteenth-century author (whose books therefore appeared in publishers' bindings) with numerous twentieth-century editions (and thus can illustrate some of the recent discussions particularly well). I do not think of this description as a contribution to Melville studies, though in fact it does place on record some points not previously published; it is primarily a sample of descriptive techniques, and therefore I have abridged the sample at many points, whenever I thought that no additional technique—not already illustrated—would be shown by providing the whole description. What I am particularly concerned to demonstrate is that descriptive bibliography is a form of biographical, and thus historical, scholarship. One can no more prescribe a single form for it than one can for any other historical work. Each bibliographer-historian's choice of detail and manner of presentation will create one version of the past, and that is all that any historian can accomplish. Nevertheless, there are responsible ways of setting forth the evidence of past events and ways less responsible. What I show here seems to me responsible, but I have no wish to suggest that it is the only responsible approach. It is a sample, nothing more; but I hope it, with its commentary, can help to suggest a general way of thinking that will be of use to others, even if in various details of presentation they decide to follow another form. I also hope that it can demonstrate the integral place of textual history in the story a bibliography has to tell. That a bibliography is one kind of literary and publishing history is suggested by the fact that much of the same research underlies a literary biography, a scholarly edition, and a descriptive bibliography. Ideally a bibliography and an edition at least, if not a biography, emerge as products of the same research, and I am fortunate to be able to present facts in this description that have been turned up in the course of research for the Northwestern-Newberry Edition. I acknowledge here the assistance of Harrison Hayford, Richard Colles Johnson, and the others who have played a role (or are still playing one) in the great Newberry Library Melville Collection and in the Northwestern-Newberry Melville Project. In the commentary, running along the bottom of the pages of description presented here, I have referred in a shorthand form to Bowers's Principles and a number of essays written since his book.

Reprinted in Fredson Bowers at Eighty (1985), pp. 25-47. Many other relevant pieces are cited in the documentation to these articles and therefore need not be cited here. I should perhaps note that Gaskell is listed here not for his chapter on descriptive bibliography but for the historical chapters that make up the bulk of his book and that provide essential background for any bibliographer. And I should point out that in some small details the sample below does not always match the precise form set forth in my essays: what I am concerned to maintain is the approach to descriptive bibliography on which they rest, not (as I hope they make clear) an inflexible manner of presentation for every detail, even though a degree of uniformity is of course desirable. I should also perhaps mention, for the record, the most significant discussions of descriptive bibliography that preceded Bowers, for the list can reasonably be limited to five: A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg, "Some Points in Bibliographical Descriptions," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-08), 31-52. [Followed by Falconer Madan, "Degressive Bibliography," pp. 53-65.] Reprinted in Alfred William Pollard: A Selection of His Essays , ed. Fred W. Roper (1976), pp. 116-129. A. W. Pollard, "The Objects and Methods of Bibliographical Collations and Descriptions," Library , 2nd ser., 8 (1907), 193-217. Reprinted in Alfred William Pollard: A Selection of His Essays , ed. Fred W. Roper (1976), pp. 98-115. Falconer Madan, E. Gordon Duff, and S. Gibson, "Standard Descriptions of Printed Books," Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings and Papers , 1 (1922-26), 55-64. Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927). W. W. Greg, "A Formulary of Collation," Library , 4th ser., 14 (1933-34), 365-382. Reprinted in Greg's Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 298-313. These lists leave out actual examples of bibliographies (except those by Greg and Stevenson, cited for their introductions), but there are several recent ones that repay study, as well as such earlier classic works as Michael Sadleir's Trollope (1928), Frederick A. Pottle's Boswell (1929), A. T. Hazen's Strawberry Hill (1942) and Walpole (1948), and Richard L. Purdy's Hardy (1954). If I were to add some post-Bowers bibliographies to my list, the first one to go on would be David L. Vander Meulen's 1981 dissertation, A Descriptive Bibliography of Alexander Pope's Dunciad, 1728-1751 , an extraordinary piece of work that makes several innovations in descriptive technique. Among the other bibliographies that next deserve to be noted are David Gilson's Jane Austen (1982), for its unusually thorough notes on paper, typography, and binding (those on typography by Nicolas Barker); and James L. W. West III's William Styron (1977) and Stuart Wright's Randall Jarrell (1986), for their attention to textual variants (and the Styron for its concern with platings as well). There are many other recent bibliographies, with excellences in one or another feature, that one can profit from examining, such as William B. Todd's Burke (1964), Warner Barnes's E. B. Browning (1967), Daniel Heartz's Pierre Attaignant (1969), B. C. Bloomfield and Edward Mendelson's Auden (rev. 1972), Joan St. C. Crane's Robert Frost (1974), C. William Miller's Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia Printing (1974), James A. Grimshaw's Robert Penn Warren (1981), William S. Peterson's Kelmscott Press (1984), and the volumes in the Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography (1972- ). For a record of bibliographies, one can consult T. H. Howard-Hill's Bibliography of British Literary Bibliographies (1969; supplemented by his Shakespearian Bibliography and Textual Criticism: A Bibliography , 1971, pp. 179-322) and G. T. Tanselle's Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (1971). The pages of the Library , the Book Collector , and the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America will keep one abreast of new bibliographies through critical reviews. Three examples of particularly good reviews, all from PBSA , are James B. Meriwether's review of Frederick Woods's Churchill (60 [1966], 114-122), Hugh Amory's of Sidney L. Gulick's Chesterfield (74 [1980], 286-294), and David L. Vander Meulen's of David Gilson's Jane Austen (79 [1985], 435-442). I have attempted to provide an assessment of the bibliographies in American literature ( Studies in Bibliography , 21 [1968], 1-24) and in eighteenth-century English literature ( Eighteenth-Century English Books Considered by Librarians and Booksellers, Bibliographers and Collectors [1976], pp. 22-33), as well as to place the development of descriptive bibliography in the larger setting of bibliographical history ("Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century," in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine , ed. Philip M. Teigen [1982], pp. 55-79; "The Evolving Role of Bibliography, 1884-1984," in Books and Prints, Past and Future [1984], pp. 15-31). It is in the context of all this work that the following sample should be viewed. * * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D. REDBURN (1849) Heading (D) . The approach to reference numbers and letters reflected here is set forth in Tanselle 1984, pp. 28-38. Underlying it is the idea that bibliographers should think independently about what will be most efficient in a given situation and not automatically assume, for example, that all the separate publications by an author must go into a section labeled "A"—a system that produces unnecessarily cumbersome references, since a typical "A" section is likely to require more complex reference numbers than the rest of the bibliography anyway, and attaching "A" to every one of them only complicates matters. One solution, as here, is to use letters to stand for an author's successive separate publications: Redburn , Melville's fourth book, is therefore taken up in a section labeled "D." This system works well with Melville, for the treatment of his book-length works would require the letters (skipping I) through about T, leaving the remaining letters to be employed in the more conventional way, designating sections recording multiple works (in this case, such categories as shorter works, collected sets, collected volumes, and appearances in anthologies). Of course, an author who wrote more books than Melville did would have to be handled differently, either by going into a doubled alphabet or (probably better) using numbers instead of letters (and then using letters instead of numbers for the next digit—e.g., "4A" instead of "D1"). In the heading illustrated here, the presence of the year 1849 is not meant to suggest that the section deals only with the first edition; this heading stands at the beginning of the entire section on Redburn , and the year is present only to aid the reader by showing the date of first publication and therefore the basis for the ordering of the sections. (In the present instance, one might wish to use "September 1849" instead, since Melville's preceding book, Mardi , had also appeared in 1849.) See also the comments on the D1 heading below. Introduction to the section . Because each section dealing with the entire publishing history—from original publication to the present day—of one of Melville's books is fairly extensive, it seems useful to have an introduction to each section, providing the reader with a concise summary of that publishing history. This introduction may, but need not, contain information not present in the actual description; its function is to draw together in one place the salient facts established elsewhere and thus to assist readers by providing them, in effect, with a general outline of what is to follow. By combining facts from individual descriptions, it can give an overview that will help readers to place particular editions and printings in a larger context. Textual relationships among editions are an important aspect of publishing history and should be covered, along with key physical points and facts drawn from external sources. (Identification of sources used is unnecessary here if the descriptions that follow do, in one way or another, provide it.) The publication history of Melville's fourth book follows the pattern of the two immediately preceding books: the American publisher had the work set in type from the manuscript furnished by Melville, and the British publisher used corrected proof sheets of the American edition as printer's copy; but the British edition was published six weeks earlier than the American in an attempt to establish copyright for the English publisher. Thus the edition that was first released to the public contained a text that was derived from the edition released later. The American edition, being a step closer to the manuscript (which is not known to survive) than is the British edition, is therefore the proper basis for new editions that hope to reflect Melville's intentions, though the differences between the two are relatively small in number and not of major significance. The original British edition, published by Richard Bentley, consists of a single printing, which appeared in at least three issues: the original two-volume issue dated 1849, a one-volume issue with cancel title leaves dated 1853, and an issue (two-volume?) of undetermined date with the spine imprint of T. C. Newby. Various states of individual sheets exist as a result of the movement of type during printing; and the binding of the original Bentley issue exhibits small variations in stamping and two styles of endpapers. The American edition, published by Harper &amp; Brothers, went through six printings between 1849 and 1875; the last four (1850, 1855, 1863, 1875) can be identified by their title-page dates, but the first two (both dated 1849) must be distinguished by noting whether gathering R has ten leaves (its first printing) or twelve leaves (its second)—though copies are not likely to be of first- or second-printing sheets throughout. Copies with either printing of R are found in printed paper wrappers as well as cloth of two varieties. Only one other edition of Redburn appeared during Melville's lifetime, an unauthorized edition published in Paris in 1850 by A. &amp; W. Galignani and Jules Baudry as part of Baudry's "British Library"; its text, derived from the Bentley edition, is somewhat shortened. The number of copies in the Galignani-Baudry edition has not been ascertained, but the total number printed in the two authorized editions was only 5,468 (750 in the single Bentley printing and 4,718 in the six Harper printings), earning Melville a lifetime total for this book of only $1,167.57 ($484 in a single payment from Bentley and $683.57 in half-profits from the Harpers over a period of almost four decades). At the time of Melville's death, Redburn had not been available in England for nearly forty years; and it was virtually out of print in the United States, for the Harpers' last account to Melville, on 4 March 1887, reported eighteen copies still on hand (from the printing of 147 twelve years earlier), and their 1892 catalogue did not include the title. Redburn was not one of the books revived in the years just after Melville's death, and thirty more years would pass before it came into print again—in the Constable "Standard Edition" of 1922. Since then it has been set in type eight times—three more times in the 1920s (Page, Boni, Pick-wick) and once in 1937 (Cape), 1957 (Anchor), 1969 (Northwestern-Newberry), 1976 (Penguin), and 1983 (Library of America)—and some of these editions have appeared under different imprints in later or transatlantic printings (bringing the total number of twentieth-century publishers' or series imprints associated with Redburn to nineteen). One test to distinguish whether an edition follows the original American or British text is to note whether the third sentence of Chapter 49 contains the phrase "large and womanly" (American) or "quick, small, and glittering" (British). All the twentieth-century editions are based (with greater or lesser fidelity) on the American text, but only the three most recent ones offer any comment on their textual policy. The Northwestern-Newberry edition (published 120 years after the first edition) is by far the most detailed in its presentation of textual evidence, and its critical text is faithfully reset in the widely distributed Library of America edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D1. Original British Edition (London: Bentley, 1849) Heading (D1) . Following the system in Tanselle 1984, esp. p. 37, the arabic number following the letter designates the edition number. The rest of the heading is meant to offer a convenient shorthand designation in words for the edition under discussion. To say "First Edition" here would add no information to what is already conveyed by "D1," and it seems sensible to convey additional information in such headings whenever possible. Moreover, the phrases "original British" here and "original American" later emphasize a more important point than the simple priority in publication, by a few weeks, of the former over the latter. Introductory discussion (following the D1 heading) . For each edition treated in detail, one may wish to begin with some introductory commentary, partly to serve the same function for the edition that the earlier paragraphs did for the work, but also to assemble into a coherent narrative such evidence as there is regarding contracts, publication and copyright dates, the author's relations with the publisher, and the like. (On copyright, see Tanselle 1969.) In effect, all the kinds of details that come from sources outside the copies of the edition themselves can be gathered here, leaving the descriptions that follow to concentrate on the physical evidence. Many bibliographical descriptions in the past have placed such information in one or more sections called "Notes," following the treatment of physical details, and sometimes these sections are not narrative in form but are simply enumerations of relevant facts. This approach remains one possibility, of course, but I show here a different approach, which reflects more directly the concept of a bibliography as a work of historical scholarship. The crucial point is not the manner of presentation of the material but the underlying conception of the work: a bibliography is not a listing of points for identification but a historical account, partly biography and partly a segment of publishing history (which itself encompasses the history of the arts of book-making as well as economic and intellectual history). This view of bibliography underlies Bowers's Principles and his 1953, 1966, and 1969 essays; see also Tanselle 1984 ( passim , but esp. pp. 2-3 and the references in footnote 3) and Tanselle 1985 (esp. pp. 46-61), as well as Vander Meulen 1985. Providing narrative introductions of the kind I illustrate here does serve to drive home the point—both to authors of bibliographies and to their readers—that bibliographies are histories and that, like all histories, they attempt to offer coherent readings of the past. Different bibliographers will make different selections of details; what I show here seems to me one reasonable selection, but there are always more details that can be included. One point naturally to be kept in mind is what kind of scholarly coverage already exists. In the case of Melville, the existence of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition, with its historical and textual essays and records of variant readings, would make redundant in a bibliography an extensive account of the composition and reception of Melville's books or lists of variant readings. The research underlying a scholarly edition and that underlying a scholarly bibliography are complementary, and the published results can be complementary, too. Thus when, in the present introduction, I refer to the 79 substantive variants between the Harper and Bentley editions of Redburn , there is no need to record them, for they are already available in the Northwestern-Newberry volume, and readers of the bibliography would have been told in the general introduction to the whole work that for complete lists of variants they should turn to the Northwestern-Newberry Edition. I am free to be selective in my use of variants, and I have decided here that only one deserves mention, given the scale on which the bibliography is being written. (However, variants between copies of a single printing—such as those created by stop-press alterations or by type or plate wear—demand fuller treatment somewhere in the description, even if they have been reported in another work; see the paragraph on typography below.) Similarly, documentation of frequently used sources need not be repeated in each of these introductions; instead, the general introduction can explain, for example, that quotations from Melville's letters always come (unless otherwise specified) from Merrell R. Davis and William H. Gilman's edition (1960) or that certain kinds of detail always come (unless otherwise specified) from the Northwestern-Newberry Edition. Documentation would then be supplied only for unusual sources or for sources inconvenient to refer to without specific references (hence the citations here of particular pages in the volumes of Bentley Papers at the British Library). For those details repeated in this introduction from one of the later descriptions, documentation—if needed—would come at that later point, where the matter is likely to be more fully treated. I do not find any awkwardness in the shift from narrative in these introductions to the more formulaic style of the physical descriptions: the two parts deal with very different material. A formulaic rendering of dates, quotations, sums of money, and the like seems to resemble undigested raw material and is not the most effective way of conveying what is in fact a narrative. On the other hand, the formulaic style is generally more efficient in laying physical details out clearly and more convenient for readers who wish to check copies against the description. (Cf. Tanselle 1984, footnote 6.) I ought to add, however, that one should never hesitate to use sequential prose within a physical description when it seems to offer a clearer way to make certain statements. Melville's earliest known reference to Redburn occurs in a letter of 5 June 1849 to Richard Bentley, who had published the British edition of Mardi and was to publish White-Jacket and The Whale . In view of the slow sales of Mardi , Melville took pains to emphasize that the new book would be "a thing of a widely different cast": "a plain, straightforward, amusing narrative of personal experience—the son of a gentleman on his first voyage to sea as a sailor—no metaphysics, no conic-sections, nothing but cakes &amp; ale." Nevertheless, Bentley's reply, on 20 June, was disappointing: alluding to the sales of Mardi and the uncertain copyright situation, he felt that he could offer only £100 as an advance against half-profits (not the £150 that Melville wanted, much less the £210 paid for Mardi ). By the time Melville wrote to Bentley on 20 July, Harper &amp; Brothers had accepted the work and given it to the printer, and Melville assured Bentley that proof sheets could be sent "in the course of three weeks or so." Apparently they were sent fairly promptly, for Bentley published his edition (750 copies, two volumes each, at a guinea per set) on 29 September, in advance of American publication, as the agreement stipulated. (See Bentley Papers, Add. 46637, ff.72 v -73, where the official publication date is recorded as 29 September—although Melville, in a letter to Lemuel Shaw on 6 October, stated that the book had been published "on the 25th of last month.") The book was entered in the Publishers' Circular for 1 October, in the list of new publications for the period 14-29 September; it was advertised as available on 28 September in the Athenaeum for 22 September and listed in that journal and the Literary Gazette on 29 September; and it was included in an advertisement for "Mr. Bentley's New Publications for the Month of October" in the 1 November number of Publishers' Circular . Melville had read and marked the Harper proof sheets before sending a set to Bentley; but he had no opportunity to go over proofs of Bentley's edition, which, as it turned out, differed from the Harper edition in wording at 79 points (and at many more, of course, in spelling and punctuation). Only one of those differences, however, poses any question of textual authority, for all the others fall into one of three classes—obvious errors, the correction of obvious errors, and other alterations of the kind ordinarily made in Bentley's office (e.g., the substitution of British idioms). The one difference that may be a revision of Melville's is the substitution of "quick, small, and glittering" for "large and womanly" as the description of Harry Bolton's eyes in the third sentence of Chapter 18 in Volume 2 (Chapter 49 of the Harper edition). If both readings are Melville's, the Bentley reading is not necessarily the later one, for Melville could have made a late revision on the Harper proofs after sending one set to Bentley. (The Northwestern-Newberry editors conclude that, whoever wrote "quick, small, and glittering," it was the other wording that Melville wanted.) Redburn had been alluded to in the London press a month before publication, in the Literary Gazette of 25 August (p. 630). During the autumn, Bentley advertised the book in the usual prominent journals—in the Athenaeum , for example, on 8, 15, and 22 September and 13 and 27 October, and in the Spectator on 29 September and 20 October. The earliest known review appeared in the Literary Gazette for 20 October (pp. 776-778), and a half-dozen more reviews came out before the end of the month. Although the long review in the November number of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (66:567-580) was unfavorable, most of the British reviews were laudatory; but even so the book did not sell well, for in an accounting two and a half years later (on 4 March 1852) Bentley reported that he still had on hand 415 of the 750 copies. The profit on the book at that time he reckoned at £23.12.6; and since he had paid Melville £100 (when Melville visited his London office on November 12: see Melville's journal; the payment is also recorded in the Bentley Papers, Add. 46676A, f.3), he incurred a deficit of £76.7.6. In an effort to reduce that deficit, he had some of the remaining sheets bound as single volumes and issued them with cancel title leaves dated 1853. At some point he also sold sheets to the remainder publisher T. C. Newby, who issued them (in two-volume sets?) with his own name on the spines. Bentley had no more reason to be pleased with the sales of Redburn than with those of Mardi . First Bentley Issue (London, 1849) Heading for first Bentley issue . No entry number is assigned here, in the belief that descriptions of issues should not be regarded as separate entries but rather as subsections of the entry for the printing of which they are a part. It should also be recognized that furnishing entry numbers for issues would complicate any system considerably and thus perhaps make it less efficient: this Bentley issue would have to be numbered—in the system I am using, which is essentially a very simple one—D1.1a. It could not be labeled "D1a," for lower-case letters attached to edition numbers ought to refer to subeditions, so that numbers could be attached, following a decimal point, to signify printings. Clearly an issue designator has to be associated with the number referring to printing, but since this Bentley edition consists of only a single printing, it seems unnecessary (indeed, illogical) to call it a first printing. On this general matter, see Tanselle 1984, esp. p. 37 and footnote 64. The concepts lying behind the terms "edition," "subedition," "printing" (or "impression"), "issue," and "state" are set forth in Bowers's Principles , pp. 37-113, 371-426, supplemented (and somewhat modified) in Tanselle 1975. When separate platings (e.g., duplicate relief plates made from the type, or offset plates made photographically from a copy of a printed book) can be identified they should be noted (perhaps in the heading); but, contrary to the argument of James L. W. West III ("The Bibliographical Concept of Plating ," Studies in Bibliography , 36 [1983], 252-266), it seems advisable to use subedition (i.e., any printing or sequence of printings with a different publisher's or series imprint) rather than plating as the classification between edition and printing (for an explanation, see Tanselle 1984, pp. 10-20). Title-page transcription . The dominant system of quasi-facsimile transcription, as developed over the years, is the one codified, extended, and thoroughly explained in Bowers's Principles , pp. 135-184, 427-429. It attempts to report more typographic features (such as line endings) than does ordinary quoting, but it does not suggest relative sizes of type, except when both large and small capitals appear in the same line. (However, David Vander Meulen's 1981 dissertation, a descriptive bibliography of Pope's Dunciad to 1751, shows that a type-face measurement can be easily and unobtrusively added in brackets at the end of each line of the transcription.) That such transcriptions are not superseded by photographic facsimiles is touched on in the Principles , pp. 135-137, and in Bowers 1953, esp. pp. 9-15; and the argument is most fully set forth in Tanselle 1985, pp. 46-61. One should assume that the description of Redburn presented here would in the actual bibliography be accompanied by appropriate reproductions of title-pages, but their presence would not affect the transcriptions. Photographic facsimiles are illustrations that supplement the verbal account but do not substitute for it. It is also imporant to remember that title-pages are not the only parts of books that may usefully be transcribed in quasi-facsimile (and not necessarily the most important ones). Collation . The system of signature collation that has evolved in the English-speaking world since the late nineteenth century received its classic treatment (superseding several earlier landmark discussions) in Bowers's Principles , pp. 196-268, 332-339, 431-434, 487-499 (with "A Digest of the Formulary" on pp. 457-461), now supplemented and somewhat revised in Tanselle 1985, pp. 61-80. (See also Greg 1959, Stevenson 1961, and Margadant 1968.) The principal function of the collation is to show the physical structure of books, and the collation is therefore the indispensable heart of any description (more important than the title-page transcription), though some bibliographers of twentieth-century books have attempted to argue otherwise. ( Redburn contains no inserted plates; but when they are present, they obviously complicate the task of recording structure—see the Principles , pp. 287-289, Stevenson 1961, Bridson 1976, and Tanselle 1982.) A record of where the signatures appear and in what form is a separate (and lesser) matter, but it should be provided as a supplementary statement to the collation. The signature statement in this sample follows the form in Tanselle 1985, pp. 78-80, which only slightly modifies the form suggested by Bowers ( Principles , pp. 269-271). (On the use of the dollar sign to stand for a signature and thus to refer to every gathering, see the Principles , pp. 266-268.) In the collation given here, I have assumed the 23-letter alphabet (without J, either U or V, and W) traditionally used by printers, and this fact would be explained in the introduction to the bibliography; but for books of this period some bibliographers might prefer to be more explicit and write "B-I 12 K-O 12 " instead. Indication of format (here "12°") must be included when it can be ascertained, since the regular number of leaves in gatherings does not necessarily reveal the format (the number of times each sheet was folded); when (as in many twentieth-century books) the format cannot be determined, measurement of the leaf size can be substituted, as Bowers suggests. A helpful assemblage of imposition diagrams for various formats is found in Gaskell's New Introduction , pp. 84-107. On the rules for recording pagination (and the crucial one of not combining unnumbered and numbered pages with a dash, as in " i -viii"), see the Principles , pp. 271-284, 435-438, 462 (but numbered and unnumbered pages can be combined in the contents paragraph or elsewhere, the facts having been put on record here). Contents . The basic rules are in Bowers's Principles , pp. 289-299, 438-444. In a book made up of numerous short pieces, such as stories or poems, one should not simply have an entry for "text" but should enumerate the contents (either in this paragraph or in a separate paragraph below, where references to their original appearances in periodicals, for example, could also be included, perhaps in columnar form). Any words that one wishes to quote might as well be quoted in quasi-facsimile, since it conveys more information and scarcely takes up any more space; and one should wish to quote instead of paraphrase whenever feasible (e.g., quoting the form of the heading to the table of contents instead of simply referring to "table of contents"). I show here the convention of using single quotation marks to signal quasi-facsimile transcription and double quotation marks to indicate ordinary quoting. Punctuation supplied by the bibliographer must therefore go outside the single quotation marks but may—if the American system of punctuation is being followed—go inside the double ones. Paper . The system followed here and the considerations underlying it are set forth in Tanselle 1971(1), where references to much of the relevant literature also appear. Anyone attempting to describe paper should be acquainted with at least as much historical background as is provided in Gaskell's New Introduction , pp. 57-77, 214-230, before beginning to examine the relevant specialized works. Those dealing with pre-nineteenth-century paper should certainly know the great series of essays by Allan Stevenson (1949, 1952, 1954, 1962) and Vander Meulen's important 1984 article (a worthy successor to that series). Vander Meulen's own descriptions of paper in his bibliography of The Dunciad (his 1981 dissertation) are exemplary, showing an orderly way to set forth mixtures of papers (e.g., pp. 72-77). Measurements here (and throughout) are in millimeters, though one need not use the metric system; it is extremely convenient, however, and Vander Meulen notes its particular convenience for paper measurement (pp. 60-61). My measurements of paper thickness (made by micrometer) are to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter, and the leaf and total-bulk measurements to the nearest third of a millimeter. (The bulking thickness of each sheet is of course arrived at by dividing the total bulk by the number of leaves—and rounding off to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter.) The tolerances I have set for myself would be specified in the general introduction to the bibliography. On the importance of stating tolerances, see Tanselle 1968(1). The present description represents a moderate level of detail, which I have tried to adhere to in other paragraphs of the description as well. More details could be given, but more would probably then have to be given in other paragraphs, so that the proportions of the whole description would remain balanced. Typography . The approach illustrated here is essentially that advocated in Tanselle 1966 (1), where the value of recording these details in a description is explained. Bowers's Principles includes a brief treatment of typography (pp. 300-306, 344-347, 444-446); and, as with paper, Gaskell's New Introduction gives the basic background (pp. 9-56, 201-213; but see Vander Meulen 1985, p. 215). The goal in this sample, with a moderate amount of detail, is to suggest the principal characteristics both of the type faces used and of the typographic layout. Even at this modest level of detail, the identification of the text type might well be carried further: for a rare example of meticulous attention to typography in post-1800 books, see Nicolas Barker's notes on types in David Gilson's A Bibliography of Jane Austen (1982). The paragraph on typography is the place to draw together comments on all aspects of what is printed on the sheets, and when there is a great deal to record regarding running titles and catchwords, as often in pre-1800 books, it may be necessary for ease of reference to provide special subsections, separated by spaces from the main paragraph, to cover these matters. A splendid treatment of such problems (but one that is unfortunately not very accessible) is Vander Meulen's 1981 dissertation, his bibliography of The Dunciad to 1751, where the sections on typography are sometimes the longest in a description because they include subsections recording running titles, catchwords, signatures (which may be regarded as an aspect of typography and need not be recorded in the collation paragraph), and ornaments (sometimes with tables to show patterns of recurrence). He also sensibly offers a section on presswork, where he records first-forme impressions (whether the inner or the outer of each sheet), point holes, and press figures (the latter in the form suggested in Tanselle 1966(2)). What I have here labeled "Typographical variation" might better be placed in a paragraph on presswork, for these variations are certainly not part of the planned typography of the book. On the other hand, they are a characteristic feature of the typographic impressions that appear on the sheets being described. In the case of Redburn these variations consist only of unimportant shiftings of type during the course of printing; the principal examples are noted (by page and line, with empty brackets to show where space exists as a result of shifting type and with each instance documented by reference to individual copies—see the paragraph on copies examined below); but they do not need to be reported in full or given the prominence of a separate paragraph. (On the general use of type damage, see Tanselle 1968(2).) However, stop-press textual alterations are indeed important and deserve to be reported in full (or perhaps selectively, if already reported in an edition) and keyed to individual copies; therefore they may, if extensive, require a paragraph of their own. The important theoretical point here concerns the treatment of states. Typographical variations create states of individual sheets; but such states—and states of all kinds—refer only to particular parts of books, not copies of books as wholes (cf. Tanselle 1975). Thus states do not call for separate entries (indeed, could not be handled clearly by separate entries) but instead should be described under whatever heading (paper, typography, binding) encompasses the particular variation involved. Binding . The term "binding" is used here to refer to any covering of the sheets that was supplied by the publisher, whether paper wrappers or a casing of cloth over boards. But a more purist usage would not allow "binding" to be used when "casing" is meant. The overall form of the description is based on Tanselle 1970 (the illustrations in which are referred to by the cloth-grain citation numbers), with colors specified in reference to the Centroid charts, as recommended in Tanselle 1967. Publishers' binding is discussed briefly in Bowers's Principles , pp. 446-450, and in Gaskell's New Introduction , pp. 231-250. (Dust jackets, when they exist, would be described either in the binding paragraph or, more appropriately, in a separate paragraph following it—see Tanselle 1971(2), where several samples are provided on p. 114. Descriptions of the endpapers and of the treatment of the edges of the leaves, along with an account of any advertisements or other leaves inserted during the binding process, do clearly belong in the paragraph on binding.) The reference here to "Bentley 2" illustrates how one can incorporate citations of illustrations into verbal descriptions. The actual Melville bibliography would include a section of photographs showing the various stampings used on the cloth casings of Melville's books; the citation here of the second such Bentley pattern does not lessen the bibliographer's obligation to describe it in words. Variations here in spine stamping and in endpapers again illustrate the treatment of states. The concept of state does not refer to whole copies of books but only to their parts, and these variations only result in states of the binding and endpapers; they are therefore properly taken up in this paragraph and do not necessitate separate entries. Every variant state must be documented by citation of specific copies from among those listed in the record of copies examined (see the next paragraph of the description). Copies examined . The importance of a paragraph identifying the copies that provided the evidence for the bibliographical account that precedes it cannot be overestimated. But I am tempted to belabor its importance because so often it has been disregarded. A description that does not record copies examined is simply incomplete and unscholarly. Readers must know what copies were looked at, so that they will know when they are looking at additional copies and so that they can locate, when they wish, copies that display any of the features described. As set up here, the record of copies examined is organized by country, with copies arranged alphabetically under each country according to library abbreviations (those of the National Union Catalog for the United States and Canada and those of the British Union Catalogue of Periodicals for Britain, with additional ones constructed on the same pattern). Following each library identification is the shelfmark or call number, followed in turn by a reference to any post-publication alterations to the copy (such as rebinding, the excision of leaves, or the insertion of a bookplate or inscription). The much misunderstood concept of "ideal copy" simply refers to all those characteristics that copies possessed when they left the control of the publisher, as opposed to those characteristics that individual copies have subsequently acquired at the hands of their owners. The bibliographer's task is to record the former: "ideal copy" does not necessarily mean a single copy but rather encompasses all the variations of the book as published. Bowers has commented on the concept in the Principles , pp. 113-123, 404-406; the fullest analysis is in Tanselle 1980 (and cf. Tanselle 1977). The record of copies examined must note post-publication alterations of copies, at least when they result in the elimination of parts of the originals, so that readers will know exactly which copies did, and which did not, contribute to the body of evidence on which each element of the description was based. If the roster of copies is sequentially numbered, individual copies can then be referred to concisely in the body of the description. References to copy numbers in the paragraphs on typography and binding above show how variant features of the copies as published can be conveniently documented. The division should be clear between variations that are part of a book's publication history (they are taken up in the description, with references made to particular copies) and variations that occurred subsequently (they form no part of the description but are noted in the record of copies examined as peculiarities of particular copies).

Edges . Untrimmed. Endpapers . Two varieties of endpapers have been discovered: (A) white paper printed in deep blue (179) with a circular pattern and with advertisements listing works of "History and Biography" (beginning with "Correspondence of Schiller") on the front pastedown and "Voyages and Travels" (beginning with "Mackay's Western World") on the back pastedown (all copies but 9); (B) pale yellow (89) coated paper printed with two pages of advertisements listing works of "History and Biography" (beginning with "Memoirs of the House of Orleans") on the front pastedown and recto of the front free endpaper, and two pages listing "Voyages and Travels" (beginning with "Wayside Pictures") on the verso of the back free endpaper and the back pastedown (copy 9).

Second Bentley Issue (London, 1853) Second Bentley issue . This section shows how subsequent descriptions under the heading of a single edition can be made to relate to the first description. The cancel title of the 1853 issue exhibits enough differences from the 1849 title that it seems easier to provide a new transcription, whereas the differences in collation and contents are slight enough that they can be best handled by simple statements setting forth what the differences are.

Newby issue . Sometimes an extensive search for copies fails to produce an example of some form that has been previously referred to in print. In many instances such references can be dismissed as bibliographical ghosts (though they should normally be mentioned and explicitly dismissed). At other times one may judge the reference to be trustworthy and deserving of a place in the bibliography. Michael Sadleir's assertion that he had seen a copy of the Newby issue seems to me to fall into the latter class. (His Excursions in Victorian Bibliography of 1922 and his 1923 bibliography in the Constable edition, referred to here in short form, are among the basic works that would be identified in the general introduction to the bibliography.) Apparently Bentley sold some sheets to T. C. Newby, who had them bound (as two-volume sets?) with his imprint on the spines. Michael Sadleir ( Excursions , p. 226, and Constable edition, 12:349) reports having seen such a copy, but I have not been able to locate one. (Of course, Newby may also have been the distributor of some copies with the Bentley bindings, if Bentley sold him bound copies, as well as sheets, at a reduced price.)</field>

For this book, it seems sufficient to insert a parenthetical explanation rather than to enumerate the 61 affected pages, but for another book (particularly from an earlier period and with irregular pagination) the decision might be different. In any case, the sequence "14-390" should not be interrupted 61 times—a procedure that would require the reader to look carefully through the entire series of numbers. If the numbers are to be recorded, they should be brought together in the appended parenthesis. contents . . . . 391-394 advertisements for Typee , Mardi , Omoo , and Charles Lyell's A Second Visit to the United States . 1 -10 "Book List of the Present Season," dated October 1849. Contents . Only the end of the contents paragraph is shown here to make the point that advertisements on integral leaves must be reported in this paragraph, because they constitute part of the contents of the sheets. (But advertisements that form a separate gathering and were inserted by the binder are not included in the collation or contents paragraphs but only in the binding description.) paper . . . . typography . . . . Typographical variation . Several sheets occur in variant states as a result of plate damage. Four of the most prominent instances of damage, at points where some copies print properly, occur in the following words: 37.4,5 'stationery' / 'her' (as in copies 3, 11); 153.35,36 'might' / 'of' (10); 275.32,34 'with' / 'him' (4); 290.33,34 'pictures' / 'leading' (1-3, 11). Whether these instances of damage serve to distinguish second printings of the sheets in which they appear is not clear, for all examined copies contain sheets in both undamaged and damaged states. Thus if there was indeed a second 1849 printing (see D2.2 below), it occurred when some sheets of the first remained unbound, and sheets of the two printings were used indiscriminately in making up copies. Typography . The section on typographical variation is given here because it raises a different problem from the shifting type in the Bentley edition. Here there is some question whether two 1849 printings in fact occurred, and the uncertainty must be explained (with a cross-reference to the fuller comment at D2.2) so that readers have a basis for judging for themselves the status of copies they examine. bindings . Published simultaneously in both cloth casing and paper wrappers. Bindings . Here the heading is in the plural and the paragraph divided into two subsections, since the Harpers made Redburn available in both cloth and paper. The description of the wrappers would conform to the same plan as that of cloth bindings: description of the material (whether paper or some other material, and its style, thickness, and color) would be followed by an account of the front cover, the spine, the back cover, and the edges (and, when there is printing on them, the inside covers). Because wrappers are generally of paper and contain a considerable amount of printed text, the problems they pose for description are analogous to those offered by dust jackets—see Tanselle 1971(2), which includes sample descriptions (p. 114). The subsection on wrappers would of course identify (by copy number) which copies examined are in wrappers—just as any other feature not identical in all copies is documented by reference to specific copies. I have treated the wrappers here as a variant binding, not as a feature indicative of a separate issue, although one could argue that they represent a discrete (if simultaneous) marketing effort. In an instance of this kind (as opposed to the Bentley situation above), it is a matter of little moment whether or not one introduces the issue classification: to do so would make the arrangement of material under D2.1 somewhat less convenient and would produce no compensating advantage (conceptual or practical). One should in general be conservative in the designation of issues, and when there is no compelling need for the classification it probably should be avoided. For an exposition of the view that such decisions ought to be a matter of reasoned judgment, not of mechanical rule, see Tanselle 1975, esp. pp. 42-56, which also develops a working definition of issue . Casing . Two casings have been noted, presumably reflecting successive bindings-up, but the order is not known. (A) Material . Cord cloth (306), dark reddish purple (242) or dark grayish purple (229). Some copies exhibit what seem to be other colors, such as very dark bluish green (166) on copy 3, very dark greenish blue (175) on copy 10, and grayish brown (61) on copy 11; these colors, however, may be the result of fading and may not represent actual variants. . . . Endpapers . Light yellow (86) coated paper, accompanied at front and back by a binder's gathering of four leaves (one stuck under the pastedown, one stuck to the free endpaper, and two as flyleaves). (B) . . . Wrappers . . . . copies examined . . . . D2.2. Second Harper Printing (New York, 1849) Later Harper printings . The entries for D2.2 through D2.6 show how descriptions of later printings can build on the full description of the first printing and on each other, variously using prose paragraphs or more formulaic statements as the occasion warrants. In D2.2 a discussion of the problematical status of the second printing must come first, and since it explains the difference in collation and contents and draws on the typographical evidence, no separate paragraphs on those matters are called for. Bindings, however, are a separable matter and are best described here in a conventional binding paragraph. In the succeeding entries, D2.3 through D2.6, typographical variations play no role in identifying printings, and they are not taken up in the opening statements, which in these cases only need to be concerned with questions of title-page wording and dates, collation, and contents; typography as well as binding therefore has its own paragraph in these entries. And all entries must have a record of copies examined. The entries for these later printings, by drawing on prior entries, can be relatively concise, and yet the later printings are described no less fully than the first printing. (On the question of when to give less full descriptions, see the comments below on D4a.) The title page is unchanged, but gathering R consists of twelve integral leaves (the four additional pages of advertisements being numbered 11 14 1 2—the last two are the beginning of a list of "Standard Illustrated Works"). Because R 12 required reimposition, it presumably is a second printing. Whether there was a second printing of all the other sheets is less easy to form an opinion about, because copies with R 12 contain mixtures of sheets with and without damage at three of the four points listed above (e.g., the damage on p. 37 can be found in copies 1-9, 11, 13-17; on p. 153 in 6-8, 11-13, 17; and on p. 290 in 1-3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13-17), and at the fourth point (p. 275) all examined copies are without damage. There is perhaps even a third printing of R, because R 12 has been found to vary at two points: some copies (e.g., 5) are without damage at 387.26,28 ('I' / 'my'), where most copies contain it; in some copies (e.g., 5) the price of Wallis in line 13 of the first p. 1 in the advertisements is 87½&amp;c.nt;, whereas in other copies (e.g., 1, 2, 11, 17) it is $1.00. Without further evidence, however, only the reimposition that made R 10 into R 12 is taken here to indicate a new printing. But one should recognize that a copy with R 12 is not likely to contain second-printing sheets throughout. bindings . Both cloth casing and paper wrappers. Casing . Three casings have been seen on copies with R 12 . (A) The same as casing A described above for copies with R 10 (as on copies 1-8, 14, 17; the color on copy 10 appears as dark bluish green [165]). (B) . . . (C) . . . Wrappers . . . . copies examined . . . . D2.3. Third Harper Printing (New York, 1850) Besides the change of the title-page date to 1850, the most obvious alteration in the third printing occurs in the advertisements: R continues to have twelve integral leaves, but the order of the advertisements for Omoo and Mardi is reversed (that for Omoo now falls on p. 392 , preceding that for Mardi ) and the twelve-page catalogue is a different one (now headed "Harper &amp; Brothers' List of New Works," with Redburn the second entry on the first page). The pagination of the advertisements is therefore as before, but without the misnumbering of the last page of the twelve-page catalogue (i.e., 391-394 1 2-12 1 2). typography . All copies exhibit several new instances of plate damage, including a few that alter the punctuation of the text: at 59.30 ('icebergs'), 170.14 ('Bob'), and 375.20 ('ladies') semicolons print as commas; at 72.5 ('around') a comma is missing; and at 202.35 ('earls') a comma prints as a period. The only prominent variation noted between copies of the 1850 printing is a gradual deterioration of the comma after 'MELVILLE' in the dedication: in some copies (e.g., 1, 6, 7, 11-14, 16) it prints as a damaged comma, in others (e.g., 2) it appears as a period, and in others (e.g., 4, 5, 8-10, 17) it does not print at all. binding . . . . copies examined . . . .

Because the Galignani-Baudry edition was pirated, it is of no textual significance for the scholars wishing to establish Melville's intended text. But its text was the one most readily available to readers on the continent in the 1850s, and its very existence is an important fact of Melville's nineteenth-century publishing history. It was the only edition of Redburn in English, other than the two authorized ones, to appear in the nineteenth century, and it was one of only five unauthorized editions in English of Melville's works during the century. I would give it full bibliographical treatment—as I would all editions and printings of Melville's books (in the original language, that is) during his lifetime.

      <field name="fulltext">D4. "Standard Edition" (London: Constable, 1922) D4. " Standard Edition ." Whether to describe a collected set at a single location, or to take up each volume separately at the point where it would have been described if it had not been connected with a set, is a question that should be decided individually for each bibliography. More important is the recognition that the individual volumes of sets must be entered at two places, once with a primary entry and once with a cross-reference. Because some economy, and perhaps clarity as well, results from treating an entire set at one place, I have chosen here simply to make a reference to the place—in section V, devoted to collected sets—where the Constable edition is described. The same treatment is accorded two subeditions (i.e., printings bearing another publisher's imprint or series designation) of the entire set (D4c, D4d). But the two subeditions of Redburn alone (D4a, D4b) are best treated here. On the arrangement and numbering of entries for subeditions, see Tanselle 1984, esp. pp. 9-20, 37. (Some might argue—and they would have a point—that the original printing, with the Constable imprint, should be numbered "D4a," allowing "D4" to refer unambiguously to the entire edition, encompassing all its subeditions. On the other side is the awkwardness of making the originating publisher's printings appear to be a subedition. Neither solution is entirely happy, and both of them can be defended.) Redburn constitutes Vol. 5 of the Constable "Standard Edition" of 1922-24. For an account of this edition and its subeditions, see V1. The Constable setting of Redburn has been reprinted not only in the two reprintings of the entire set (D4c, D4d) but separately from the collected set as No. 36 in the series "Constable's Miscellany" (D4a) and in an American subedition of it published by Richard R. Smith (D4b). D4a. "Constable's Miscellany" Subedition (London, 1929) D4a. "Constable's Miscellany" subedition . This entry is an example of a condensed form of description that I suggest might be used for all editions of Melville's works after 1891, the year of his death. The idea of shifting, at some point in a bibliography, to a less detailed form of description—a concept sometimes called, following Falconer Madan, "the degressive principle"—has been much debated. By far the most thoughtful treatment of it is to be found in Bowers 1969 (supplemented by Tanselle 1984, pp. 20-28). The decision where to curtail description (if full description throughout is not deemed feasible) involves thinking through the primary purpose of the bibliography: the line would be drawn at one point if the focus is on textually important editions, at another if the aim is to write a biography in bibliographical form, and at still another if the emphasis is on how printers and publishers have handled the work of a classic author. But wherever the line is drawn, one must understand that shorter descriptions do not necessarily mean less research: one is still trying to establish and report certain facts, and the space finally given to them does not necessarily reflect the amount of time required to establish them. Furthermore, the condensed descriptions should still have logic and balance of their own. In the form proposed here some attention is paid to paper and to binding (nothing need be said about typography in an entry for a subedition, unless the typography is altered photographically, electronically, or by means of a Monotype roll); the recording of contents is selective, but the signature and pagination collations, being indispensable, are treated no less fully than they would be for a nineteenth-century edition. No precise form for condensed descriptions can, or should, be prescribed; the description I offer here is intended only as one example of a highly condensed and yet relatively well-rounded bibliographical account.

A month is included in the heading here to show why the Page edition is discussed before the Boni edition, both of which were published in 1924. The Page parent edition and some of its subeditions went through more than one printing; in conformity with the style of the condensed descriptions, an enumeration of the printings of each subedition (with identifying numbers, such as "D5a.2," attached and with significant differences noted, including an indication of whether title-page dates are altered and whether printings are identified on title-leaf versos or somewhere in the books themselves) could be run on in paragraph form (constituting a second paragraph of the entry). Because the entry for the later Cape "New Library" edition is some distance from this entry, a cross-reference linking the two Cape imprints is useful (they would also be linked in the index, of course).

The presence of a cross-reference here is important, even though this edition of Redburn does not constitute an independent volume, for the goal is not simply to record separate volumes but to convey the publication history of the work. The inclusion of an edition of Redburn within the Romances volume is a significant part of that history (as is the inclusion of another edition within a "Library of America" volume, recorded here at D12).

      <field name="heading_text">The Three Texts of 2 Henry IV by John Jowett and Gary Taylor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Disagreements abound about the textual history of 2 Henry IV , but a consensus does exist over some of its more elementary features. We have two substantive editions, the Quarto printed by Valentine Simmes in 1600 (Q) and the 1623 Folio (F). Q seems to have been set from Shakespeare's foul papers. 1 Recent studies have been more concerned with F, which was set from (or with extensive reference to) a manuscript whose characteristics are usually summed up as 'literary'. 2 The history of this manuscript, and the question of how it was used in the printing house—whether directly as printers' copy, or indirectly as a secondary source of readings—will not concern us here. 3 Instead we will begin by considering a curious bibliographical feature of Q which may be a key that unlocks the entire textual problem of the relationship between the two printed texts, and opens a door onto the literary and political interpretation of the work. Q was printed in two issues, Q(a) and Q(b). Q(a) collates A-K 4 , L 2 ; but Q(b) has been expanded to collate A-D 4 , E 6 , F-K 4 , L 2 . The added material is a complete scene, present in F, and there identified as 3.1. In order to accommodate this passage, equivalent to 113 type lines, E3 and E4 were reset with two additional leaves, E5 and E6, the second half of the original sheet E was cut out, and the additional sheet (E3-E6) stitched with E1 and E2 of the first printing. 4 This procedure stimulates a number of obvious questions. Why was the material not included in Q(a)? How did it come to be included in Q(b)? And why, if extant copies are representative, was about half the stock of sheet E in its original state used, even though the printer had gone to considerable trouble to replace it? 5 These questions are inter-linked. Alfred Hart believed that the existence of numerous Q(a) copies showed that sheet E was not reset with additional leaves until some time after original publication: these copies, he suggested, could not have had the revised pages inserted, because they had already been sold. 6 Hart believed that 3.1 was originally suppressed through censorship. The fact that the scene was printed and published in Q(b) led Hart to conjecture further that 3.1 was not printed until after Queen Elizabeth's death, by which time the scene was allowable; the large quantity of stock that was available for the cancel resulted from slow sales. Hart's hypothesis seems intrinsically improbable, in terms of the normal actions of author, printer, and publisher. Fortunately, bibliographical evidence enables us to show that the sequence of events Hart postulates almost certainly did not take place; for it seems possible to date the cancel. In 1946 James G. McManaway showed that the cancel must have been set after the remainder of the quarto. 7 Simmes is known to have begun replacing his stock of what Ferguson identifies as his 'Roman 1a' type in 1604; 8 since none of the replacement types are detectable in the cancel, it was presumably printed at some time prior to 1605, at the very latest. Different copies of the cancel sheet make use of two different states of paper, with related but clearly distinguishable watermarks. McManaway had identified only one watermark, which he found also in some copies of Sheet F of Q; he therefore concluded that the cancel dated from approximately the same period as Q(a). Although this was a reasonable inference, it could hardly in itself constitute proof, for McManaway's identification of the watermark was inexact, and similar watermarks might be found in Simmes's books of later periods. We have therefore examined at least one copy of all extant Simmes's titles for the years 1600-1604 (inclusive)—that is, for the years between Simmes's printing of Q(a) and his acquisition of new types in 1604. 9 We have found either cancel watermark in only two books: Q 2 Henry IV (1600, Sheet F), and Much Ado About Nothing (1600, Sheets D, E, F, G, H, and I). 10 In 2 Henry IV the watermarks have been found only in one sheet, and are not present in every copy; by contrast, in Ado every copy examined has one of the watermarks in at least two sheets of the last six. Of the two books, Q 2 Henry IV must have been printed, as McManaway showed, before the cancel. Much Ado had been entered in the Stationers' Register at the same time; it was printed for the same publishers, by the same single compositor, and its title-page re-used standing type from 2 Henry IV . The two plays were clearly companion jobs. Greg thought it likely, from the evidence of type-wear, that Ado was printed second of the two; John Hazel Smith observed that there was an interruption in the printing of Ado after Sheet G and conjectured that the cancel was printed during that interruption. 11 Such a conjecture could be verified only by a comprehensive examination of the evidence of recurring type in both quartos; for the moment, what matters is the established proximity of the printing of the two books. The watermarks in themselves thus date the cancel to the period 'late 1600'. In order to account for the apparent conflict between the censorship of 3.1 in Q(a) and its restitution in Q(b), Hart posited a date of '1604 or even later' (p. 218). As this dating is untenable, the case for censorship of 3.1 collapses. Hart's theory about the cancel is part of a larger hypothesis about the relationship of the Quarto and Folio texts. Hart attempted to explain why 3.1 was put back into the text, in Q(b); but he also needed to explain why it had been left out, in the first place, in Q(a). But his explanation of the omission is no more satisfactory than his explanation of its rectification. Prior to the publication of Q(a), Hart argued, 3.1 suffered at the hands of two independent excisers. He suggested that maybe 42 lines of 'undramatic' verse would have been cut by a 'play-adapter' in the theatre who was entrusted to make a suitably theatrical and performably short play out of Shakespeare's full draft. What remained of 3.1 after the 'heavy abridgement' which would be 'certain' was further attacked by the press censor in 1600. Censorship is indeed a fact of Elizabethan theatrical and book production which we cannot ignore, and it is true that at the end of 1600 (old style) the Essex rebellion may have made the censors particularly vigilant about references to insurrection or to the deposed monarch, Richard II—though what the King and Warwick actually say about Richard would not normally be accounted dangerous. Hart's first postulated stage of excision is open to more serious objections. First, one should be sceptical of 'theatrical' adaptation by any agent other than Shakespeare himself. 12 Secondly, Hart's explanation rests on a larger hypothesis: that the quarto text of this play—and most of Shakespeare's others—was set not, as is usually accepted, from foul papers, but from a prompt-book. This view has not been accepted by any editor of 2 Henry IV (or indeed any other implicated play), and we may be excused from refuting it again here. Foul papers are not likely to contain non-authorial 'theatrical' cuts, even if Shakespeare's company regularly engaged in such mutilation of a sharer's work. By Hart's account, it was only the combination of both theatrical and censorial cuts which debilitated the scene to such an extent that it was not worth printing. Take away the theatre adapter and there is no reason for the printer to omit the entire scene. It thus seems highly probable that the scene was not deliberately omitted in the printing house. There are two alternative possibilities: that it was added as an afterthought, or that it was accidentally omitted. We need not seriously entertain the idea of Shakespeare rushing new copy to the printing house in 1600 and instructing the printers to reset part of the text to accommodate it. 13 It is far more likely that the scene was included in the manuscript sent to the printers, but that something unforeseen happened to it in the printing house. The latter view has been advanced in any detail only by Alfred Pollard. 14 He identified a particular problem: how an omitted section of a play manuscript came to coincide with the theatrical unit of a scene. Pollard suggested that there was a direct correlation between manuscript leaves and quarto pages, the two sides of a single leaf being set as three printed pages. To support his conjecture he claimed that alternating compositors could be seen working in units of three pages. But more recently, Ferguson has established that a single workman, Simmes's Compositor A, set all of 2 Henry IV . In fact, Pollard's theory is not particularly helpful even in its own terms. It would lead one to suppose that if 3.1 occupied a single manuscript leaf, as he suggests, then it should have begun in Q(a) at the top of a page. It actually begins one-third of the way down a page. But Pollard's most important premise is that a single scene occupied a single leaf of manuscript. If the play was drafted in sequence, Pollard asks us to accept three coincidental circumstances: 1. that the beginning of 3.1 coincided with the beginning of a manuscript leaf; 2. that the end of 3.1 coincided with the end of a manuscript leaf; and 3. that of all the leaves which might have been omitted in Q(a), the one that was omitted happened to be the same as the one with a single scene exclusively occupying both leaves. The coincidences multiply. The omitted scene owes almost nothing to Shakespeare's historical sources. The portrait of the sick, ageing, sleepless King derives—here and throughout the play—from Samuel Daniel's 'First Fowre Bookes of the Civile Wars Between the two Houses of Lancaster and Yorke' (1595). 15 All but one of Daniel's post-Shrewsbury stanzas are concerned with the King's death-bed, and in Q(a) the King's first appearance in the play (4.4) includes his swoon, his declaration that he is 'much ill', and the expectation of those present that 'This apoplexy will certain be his end'. Without 3.1, Shakespeare would take up the King's role at exactly the point where it is taken up in the source which most influenced his presentation of the King. The play would remain entirely coherent without the scene; 3.1 itself connects with no other scene and is a self-contained unit which can be amputated without leaving a wound. 16 Both the difficulty in explaining how a single complete scene was omitted and the coherent sufficiency of the play without that scene encourage the same hypothesis: that Shakespeare added the scene as an afterthought. 17 This does not mean that the play went beyond the foul-paper stage without 3.1 in it; indeed such a postulate hinders more than it helps. But if, at some time before Shakespeare 'finished' the foul papers, he decided to add a scene to his original scheme, then such a scene would probably have been composed on a separate manuscript leaf—inserted (one may surmise) into the main body of the foul papers at the appropriate position. In this respect the addition to 2 Henry IV would have been treated similarly to the additions to Sir Thomas More —and the situation becomes closer to that in More than Pollard, who made some reference to Shakespeare's practice in that manuscript, realized. We can also see, not only how the scene came to be a detachable unit, but how it was detached. The compositor, working through the previous manuscript leaf (which we will call 'm'), would have passed the point at which the scene should have been inserted without noticing anything amiss. Like Q, the manuscript probably did not number act or scene divisions, so the compositor could not have been alerted by a correction to the numbering. Some time later he would have discovered, as he turned to the following inserted leaf (which we will call 'x'), that there was a break in continuity. Noting the continuity between leaf m and leaf n (the leaf immediately below x) he might easily identify leaf x as an inserted or misplaced section, without realizing where it should appear. If he were relatively conscientious he might keep it beside him as he moved on to leaf n and continued with the play, keeping an eye out for the proper place to insert it; if he were less scrupulous, he might simply set it aside, without bothering to investigate further. This reconstruction is of course conjectural, but it at least explains in simple physical terms how the passage might have been omitted. Pollard presumes that, for unknown reasons, the leaf was misplaced; this unexplained misplacement cannot be disproven, but it simply adds to the burden of assumptions Pollard's conjecture must bear. By contrast, we suggest that the leaf in question may well have been where it belonged—or rather, as close to where it belonged as it is physically possible for such an added leaf to be. Whether Q was set by formes or seriatim, 3.1 might have been omitted because, by the time the compositor reached it, the preceding quarto pages—among which it rightly belonged—had already been set. If the compositor kept the anomalous leaf beside him during the remainder of his setting, then he would have been looking for a place in the manuscript in which a new scene began on a new page; if no such combination presented itself, then he would eventually come to the end of the play without finding a place for the material. At this point it would have become obvious that a whole manuscript leaf, clearly belonging somewhere in the play, was left over, and the printer could discover where it belonged only in one of two ways: by asking the author (or his representatives), or by re-examining the text himself. It seems to us relatively unlikely that Shakespeare or the Chamberlain's Men were consulted—though this possibility cannot be ruled out. A cursory reading of the scene would make clear that it belongs somewhere before the King's death (4.5); closer inspection reveals that it occurs after the King has 'sent foorth' his powers against the rebels (2.4), but before they encounter the enemy (4.1). On this basis the printer could in retrospect deduce that the scene had to be placed either before or after 3.2. In other words, he need only consult the manuscript at two points, in order to look very particularly for any signals of an intended insertion. Obviously, an eye specifically looking for some cryptic mark in the margin—it may have amounted to no more than a cross or slash—is much more likely to find it, and appreciate its significance, than an eye which does not expect any such signal. Consequently, there is a good chance that the printer could have discovered where the page belonged, even though the compositor did not. And even if the printer found no such marks, he had a 50/50 chance of choosing the right position—as, on the evidence of F, he did. 18 In fact, if the compositor remembered that he came across the extra leaf at the end of setting sheet E or the beginning of setting sheet F—that is, closer to the end than the beginning of 3.2—then in retrospect anyone might have inferred the new scene's proper position, whether marked or not. We therefore conjecture that the omission of 3.1 from Q(a) resulted from its being Shakespeare's addition to his own foul papers, and was therefore contained on a separate manuscript leaf which was, as an almost inevitable result, at least minimally out of text sequence. This conjecture explains why the omitted page consists of a self-contained literary unit which could be removed without damage to the play's coherence or plot. Pollard pointed out that the scene contains as many lines as we would expect a single leaf to contain, if it were written by the same playwright who wrote Hand D's addition to Sir Thomas More ; like Pollard then and most scholars since, we believe that Hand D was Shakespeare's, and hence that the material omitted from Q(a) would neatly fit a leaf of Shakespeare's manuscript. We differ from Pollard only in offering an explanation of why this leaf contained a single detachable episode, and in explaining why it was 'misplaced' in the papers given to Simmes. Pollard's theory relies too much on coincidence; ours does not depend upon coincidence at all. Or rather, it depends on the assumption that, if Shakespeare did decide to add an interleaved scene, he might approximately fill both sides of the added leaf. He might have indicated on the original papers where the insert should go; on the other hand, if he intended to make his own fair copy of the play he need not have left any such mark at all. He might not even have bothered to fit the leaf into the appropriate place in the manuscript, but simply have left it at the end, or wherever he happened to have reached in the play when he actually wrote it. In these circumstances a compositor could not have come upon, or expected, the added leaf until he had already passed the point where its text should have been inserted: if any effort were made to incorporate it, some resetting was inevitable. Fortunately for us, the resetting took place only after the remainder of the play had been set; consequently, we can see what happened; consequently, we can 'see', in the purely bibliographical difference between Q(a) and Q(b), a curious feature of Shakespeare's own papers, which is most economically explained by the assumption that 3.1 was an addition to Shakespeare's original plan. An addition made, it is true, in the foul papers themselves, even before a fair copy had been made—but an addition nonetheless. One can easily imagine why Shakespeare added the scene. As Hart said, 'without it, the King would not present himself to the audience till more than two-thirds of the play were over; he would appear but to die.' 19 Furthermore, without this scene the stretch of the play which the Folio identifies as acts 2 and 3 would devote a mere 68 lines to the 'main' plot; the heart of the play is in Q(a) given over to a succession of comic scenes. 20 The insertion of 3.1 reminds us of the developing insurrection as well as expanding the King's role, introducing him earlier—and introducing too, in the meditative verse of this scene, 'the accent of Hamlet' and 'the troubled style of the later tragedies'. But the textual critic will notice something else. The lines on insurrection and the recollection of Richard II can now be seen, not as material excised in 1600 in the wake of the Essex rebellion (as recent editors assume), but as material added by Shakespeare c. 1597-98, and later, in 1600, added by the printer after sheets for the play had been run off the press. The allegedly censorable material seems not to have been censored after all—for the printer not only printed it, he went out of his way to do so. Both of these inferences have profound consequences for any analysis of the relationship between Q and F. When he finished the first rough draft of the play Shakespeare was apparently dissatisfied with the balance between its comic and serious material, and set out to expand the political plot by means of a major addition, largely taken up with reflections upon past historical events. Material not present in Q(a) was introduced in later texts in two stages: first in Q(b); and then in F. All of these passages expand the political plot. At least one of them—the scene inserted in Q(b)—seems to be a genuine addition to the foul papers, not a passage omitted from Q(a) because of censorship. We must therefore begin to suspect that some of the other material not present in Q(a) is absent from that text not because of interference by the censor, but because it had not yet been written when Shakespeare finished the foul papers which were eventually handed over to the printer. If one of the passages not in Q(a) is a belated revision, might not all of them be? The Folio text contains eight substantial passages present in neither Q(a) nor Q(b). A. R. Humphreys discusses all of these under the prejudicial heading, 'The Cuts in the Quarto'. However, he admits that the absence from Q of four of these passages (1.1.166-179, 1.3.21-24, 1.3.36-55, and 2.3.23-45) cannot possibly be due to censorship. Beyond that, he says almost nothing about these passages, merely conjecturing that these Quarto 'cuts' may 'reflect an attempt to shorten the play for performance' (p. lxx). Humphreys here reverts, without comment, to Hart's unsubstantiated belief that theatrical cuts were indicated in Shakespeare's foul papers. The first three passages all concern 'Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise'; the first and fourth reflect upon Northumberland's desertion of his allies at Shrewsbury; the second and third anticipate Northumberland's desertion of his new allies at Gaultree. All four can be omitted without damage to their immediate context; all four occur in the first third of the play; all four expand the role of the rebels. Similarly, 3.1 expands the role of their opponent, the King; it falls within the first half of the play; it meditates at length upon Northumberland's betrayals; it, too, looks back to the events of Richard II and Part One , and meditates upon 'how chances mockes, / And changes fill the cup of alteration, / With diuers liquors!'. Surely it is difficult to believe that the sustained interrelationship of these five passages, all absent from Q(a), is accidental, or the unintended by-product of some theatrical busybody inexplicably interfering with Shakespeare's foul papers in order to 'shorten the play' by excising 61, or even 103, lines (out of 3326). What we see here, it seems to us, is Shakespeare elaborating on the theme of his political material, and strengthening the links between Part Two and its predecessors in what we have come to regard as the second tetralogy. There should be nothing surprising about this conclusion: in this respect, at least, 2 Henry IV reveals yet again the hand of Shakespeare revising, a hand we are increasingly accustomed to seeing in King Lear , Troilus and Cressida , Othello , and Hamlet . But there is an important difference. In those other plays we are confronted by two distinct artifacts, two layers of text at an unknown distance from each other: at least in King Lear , the revision seems to have occurred years after the original composition. But in 2 Henry IV the revision seems, on the evidence of Q(b), to have begun as soon as Shakespeare completed the foul papers—if not before. We possess three layers of text, not just two, and we can see the play develop from Q(a) to Q(b) to F. It seems unlikely that there was any great delay between the addition of 3.1 and the completion of the four Folio passages in question: we are probably dealing with a continuum from rough draft, to supplemented rough draft, to authorial fair copy. The absence from Q of four other passages has generally been attributed to censorship. Political interference has been much more widely credited as an explanation of these 'omissions' than as an explanation for Q(a)'s omission of 3.1. Indeed, in two of the passages any editor of the Quarto would be bound to suspect a lacuna, even if the Folio had never been printed: Mour . Tis more then time, and my most noble lord, I heare for certaine, and dare speake the truth. North . I knew of this before, but to speake truth, This present griefe had wipte it from my mind, (1.1.187-8, 210-11; B1) Mourton's sentence is incomplete; he never reveals what he has heard; yet Northumberland has heard the unrevealed 'this' before, and repeats the very idiom Mourton had used at the end of the preceding line (speake the truth / speake truth). This is, at the very least, very suspiciously awkward. Likewise, in Act Four, after a 22½ line speech by Westmoreland, asking 'Wherefore' he has rebelled against the King, the Archbishop replies: Wherefore do I this? so the question stands: Briefly, to this end [:] we are all diseasde: The dangers of the daie's but newly gone, Whose memorie is written on the earth, With yet appearing blood, and the examples Of euery minutes instance (present now,) Hath put vs in these ill-beseeming armes, (4.1.53-4, 80-3, F4 v ) The cryptic declaration that 'we are all diseasde' is here followed by a vague, anticlimatically short and indeed inexplicably cryptic list of causes, where we might well expect something more specific. The causes for suspicion are not so blatant as in the earlier passage, but they exist nonetheless. Moreover, one might well suspect, even without the aid of F, that the two awkwardnesses are related. In one we expect an Archbishop to explain why he had lent his authority to a rebellion; in the other, what news could Mourton have to relate, except the Archbishop's opposition to the King? The suspect passage occurs at the end of 1.1; the next 'political' scene, 1.3, begins with the entrance of the Archbishop, saying 'Thus haue you heard our cause, and knowne our meanes' (1.3.1; B4 v ). While Northumberland eventually decides not to lend his military support, the Archbishop leads the insurrection, and it would be very odd if he were not mentioned in 1.1. We ought therefore reasonably to suspect, even without F, that Q is defective at two points, and that in both places the missing material had to do with an Archbishop's initiation and defence of a rebellion against the King of England. In Q's speech-prefixes the character in question is consistently called ' Bish. ' or ' Bishop '. As Hart pointed out, 'Early in 1600 Oviedo, a Franciscan monk, had come from Spain to Ireland with the title of Bishop of Dublin; in April he conferred with the native chieftains, gave them £6,000 in money and promised them Spanish military aid' (Hart, p. 191). 2 Henry IV was entered on the Stationer's Register on 23 August 1600, and printed with the date '1600'. Without accepting any of Hart' implausible conjectures about the omission of 3.1, or the general relationship between Q and F, one must immediately concede that the probability of political interference in 1600 would in these two passages have been particularly high. This is even clearer when we look at the material supplied by the Folio at those two points. In late 1600 TLN 248-68 (1.1.189-209) would have been almost unbearably topical: Morton does not spend much time on the pertinent historical specifics, but instead devotes most of the speech to the general issue of religion white-washing rebellion. Nor does this passage much resemble the others we have examined, where authorial revision seems so probable: it only refers to the past in two parenthetical lines about King Richard, and it does not dwell upon the themes of 'Surmise' or betrayal. It thus seems to us highly likely that something essentially similar to what F adds must always have stood in Shakespeare's foul papers—although it is possible that the two lines about Richard II are a later addition, since the passage runs more smoothly without them: He's follow'd both with Body, and with Minde: Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause: Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding land . . . But whether or not the reference to Richard II is an addition, it cannot itself have been the cause of the passage's deletion, because that cause need only have affected two detachable lines out of twenty. Moreover, the excision of these lines in late 1600 need not have originated with the Bishop of London himself. Sir John Hayward's First Part of the Life and Raigne of Henrie IIII had, the previous year, been suppressed because it offended Elizabeth; not only the ecclesiastical authorities, but any publisher would have been conscious of the dangerous sensitivity of such a passage. G. K. Hunter has shown that Valentine Simmes was himself almost certainly responsible for certain omissions of sensitive material from The Malcontent (1604); we have suggested elsewhere that Simmes could have been responsible for the excision of the abdication episode from Richard II (1597). 21 Richard II was printed for Andrew Wise; The Malcontent for William Aspley; 2 Henry IV for both Aspley and Wise. The one figure common to all these instances, where there is omission of sensitive political material from texts believed to have been set from authorial manuscripts, is the printer, Valentine Simmes. The second Folio-only passage (4.1.55-79; TLN 1922-47) is equally suspicious. The Archbishop's justification of his rebellion has little to do with Richard II, or Henry IV's usurpation: if these were the grounds of offence, only a line and a half need have been omitted. In this case, unlike the first, the line and a half seem likely enough to have formed part of the passage from the beginning; but in itself it can hardly have provoked excision. But Richard II is here alleged to have been 'infected'; a ' Bishop ' justifies rebellion, first in the most general terms, and then by a specific complaint which would have been, late in 1600, even more embarrassing. The primary complaint of the Earl of Essex, and what eventually provoked his abortive 'rebellion', was that he was 'deny'd accesse vnto' Elizabeth, by the very people who were his enemies and had brought him into disfavour with the Queen. Again, we find it hard to ignore the unintended but obvious relevance of these lines to the political situation in England at the time Q was printed. Neither of these passages would have been particularly objectionable in 1597-98, when the play was written and submitted to the Master of the Revels for licensing; therefore we have no reason to suspect that, as they stand in F, they are very different from the way they stood in Shakespeare's foul papers—with the possible exception of the two parenthetical lines about Richard II, which may be a late addition. We are therefore strongly inclined to regard them as an integral part of the play from its inception, excised in 1600 by the ecclesiastical censor or the printer because of their dangerous relevance to a contemporary political crisis. Two passages absent from Q thus appear to be wanting because of 'censorship'. By contrast, four other passages absent from Q but present in F appear to represent Shakespeare's own additions, made soon after completion of the foul papers. An editor would naturally prefer to find one explanation for all eight passages unique to F; but censorship can hardly be denied in two, and can hardly be maintained in four. Two causes therefore appear to be operating, and we must judge which of them is more likely to apply in each of the remaining cases. One of these passages occurs in 1.3, where we have already seen two additions which seem to result from authorial revision (ll. 21-24, 36-55). The text of Q gives us no reason to suspect a lacuna: Bish . That he should draw his seuerall strengths togither, And come against vs in full puissance, Need not to be dreaded. Hast . If he should do so, French and Welch he leaues his back vnarmde, they baying him at the heeles, neuer feare that. Bar . Who is it like should leade his forces hither? Hast . The Duke of Lancaster and Westmerland: Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth: But who is substituted against the French I haue no certaine notice. Bish . Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on? Hast . We are Times subiects, and Time bids be gone. (1.3.78-85, 109-110; C1) If suspicion attaches to any part of this passage, it affects Hastings's first speech, where the text has obviously broken down in some way, and verse has been printed as prose. Otherwise, the characters move naturally from the weakness and division of the King's forces, to an account of whom he plans to send against them, to a decision to collect their own 'numbers' and prepare themselves for an encounter with the army being sent to meet them. If Q has suffered censorship here, it has left no mark on the text, and we could only infer its operation by comparison of the Quarto with the Folio, which expands the end of the passage: I haue no certaine notice. Arch . Let vs on: And publish the occasion of our Armes. The Common-wealth is sicke of their owne Choice, Their ouer-greedy loue hath surfetted: An habitation giddy, and vnsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart. O thou fond Many, with what loud applause Did'st thou beate heauen with blessing Bullingbrooke , Before he was, what thou would'st haue him be? And being now trimm'd in thine owne desires, Thou (beastly Feeder) art so full of him, That thou prouok'st thy selfe to cast him vp. So, so, (thou common Dogge) did'st thou disgorge Thy glutton-bosome of the Royall Richard , And now thou would'st eate thy dead vomit vp, And howl'st to finde it. What trust is in these Times? They, that when Richard liu'd, would haue him dye, Are now become enamour'd on his graue. Thou that threw'st dust vpon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on, After th'admired heeles of Bullingbrooke , Cri'st now, O Earth, yeeld vs that King agine, And take thou this (O thoughts of men accurs'd) " Past, and to Come, seemes best; things Present, worst . Mow . Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on? Hast . We are Times subiects, and Time bids, be gon. (TLN 587-613) The Folio addition completes Hastings's part-line, but this cannot be taken as evidence that anything has been omitted from Q, because uncompleted concluding part-lines are common enough elsewhere in the play, and in most of Shakespeare's plays. Humphreys objects that without this passage 'the Archbishop, in a scene where he should stand out as leader, speaks only four lines at the beginning and a final one-line query' (p. lxxi). Humphreys's summary is, in point of fact, false: as we have just seen, in both Q and F the Archbishop also has another speech at ll. 76-78; he has yet another at ll. 25-26. Moreover, in the text as printed by Q the scene is only 63 lines long, of which the Archbishop speaks 9½. Humphreys underestimates the proportion of the scene given to the Archbishop, and overestimates the role which the scene manifestly requires of him. The Archbishop begins by saying 'Thus haue you heard our cause . . . Speake plainely your opinions of our hopes' (ll. 1-3). In other words, he has already, offstage, made his own contribution; he now seeks their reactions. That he does not dominate the scene which follows should hardly surprise us. Of course, in retrospect the Folio material is a definite structural improvement, but judgements that material improves a scene can never be taken as presumptive proof that it always belonged there. Moreover, Humphreys himself points to another difficulty when he refers to the Archbishop's 'final one-line query (which the folio shows to have been transferred from Mowbray)'. This formulation begs the question, which is whether Q or F changed the attribution of the scene's penultimate speech. In Q it is entirely appropriate that the Archbishop be given something to say near the end; in F, he has instead been given a long speech, so it is appropriate and indeed desirable for the penultimate line to be spoken by someone else. In their own terms, both Q and F are acceptable. But if the Archbishop's long speech was omitted for political reasons when Q was printed, it becomes difficult to explain why Q 'transferred' the penultimate speech from Mowbray to the Archbishop. Since Mowbray does not speak the preceding speech, there is no obvious difficulty in his speaking the line which the Folio assigns to him. Why should anyone have bothered to make this change? Humphreys says that the person who censored the text 'enterprisingly' wanted to 'compensate' for the loss of the Archbishop's big speech, and so 'enable him to show some small signs of leadership at the end of this scene' (p. lxxii, note 2). This conjectural being looks more like a playwright than a censor, and it is hard to believe that the man who left gaping nonsense in 1.3 and 4.1 should have shown such an intelligent concern for dramatic niceties here. The variant prefix cannot be credibly attributed to those who prepared Q for publication, and hence appears to represent genuine authorial alteration—an alteration, moreover, which can hardly be disentangled from the Folio's added speech. If we compare the added speech with the two passages where censorship may reasonably be suspected, the differences seem more significant than the similarities. The Archbishop is speaking; but he does not—as both other passages do—refer to his ecclesiastical function, or in any way attempt to justify rebellion. Indeed, what he says implicity criticizes the very enterprise upon which the rebels have embarked. The Archbishop's contempt for the feeble London mob would of course have been uncomfortably pertinent after the Essex rebellion. But the two other censored passages would have been objectionable for most of the preceding year. 22 The scene makes sense without the passage; the addition seems related to a dramatically-motivated change of speech-prefixes; it differs substantially from the two other 'censored' passages; it occurs in a scene with two other authorial expansions. Moreover, like the scene added in Q(b) and the four uncensored passages added in F, it dwells at length upon the past, upon the fickleness of fate, upon expectations of what is 'to come', and upon Richard II. Hart believed that passages were omitted from Q because they mentioned Richard II, but no such pattern can be defended. The scene added in Q(b) deals extensively with Richard II, and the other authorial expansions are much preoccupied with the earlier part of Henry IV's reign; the two censored passages, by contrast, refer to Richard II only in three-and-a-half lines, two of which may well be authorial expansions. It seems to us more likely that Shakespeare added references to Richard, than that anyone involved in printing Q subtracted them. In this respect, as in others, the Archbishop's speech belongs among the authorial expansions, not the unauthorized deletions. Finally, it appears to us that Shakespeare was not sure quite what to do with the Archbishop, and that this uncertainty of purpose explains both the original structure of the scene and its revision. The Archbishop's defence of treason is, prudently, left offstage; this leaves him little to do but invite the opinions of his colleagues (ll. 1-4), lamely confirm other people's speeches (ll. 25-26, 76-78), and initiate the exit (l. 109). Humphreys justly complains that the last of these speeches is 'colourless'; but in truth all of them are. The Archbishop plays a role here similar to Priam's in the great Trojan council-scene in Troilus and Cressida : technically he presides over the debate, but he makes little dramatic impression. Only at Gaultree does the Archbishop have a proper, interesting and dramatic part to play. It does not seem to us in the least surprising that, as originally written, the Archbishop's part in 1.3 should have been relatively feeble. By contrast, in expanding the scene Shakespeare used it as an anticipation of the disaster at Gaultree. There the rebels betray themselves when they surrender their actual physical power on the basis of promises, of 'Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise'; Folio 1.3 greatly expands the thematic debate about whether they should trust in other people's promises (Northumberland's, in this case). Moreover, at Gaultree it is the Archbishop, as leader of the rebels, who accepts Lancaster's terms, and who is thus most directly responsible for the rebels' defeat. In 1.3 the Folio makes the Archbishop more openly responsible for the decision to go ahead without Northumberland: 'Let vs on: / And publish the occasion of our Armes'. The very length of the added speech makes it look like a summing up; though in fact it has relatively little to do with the preceding debate, it does, as Humphrey says, enable the Archbishop to dominate the scene, and clearly establish himself as leader of the rebel faction. In Q he finally asks his partners 'Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?'; in F he simply declares, 'Let vs on'. The very similarity of phrasing, across this distance, suggests that the Folio's speech may be an addition: as E. A. J. Honigmann has shown, Shakespeare elsewhere integrates additions by having them begin with an anticipation of the point at which they will end, and rejoin the original text. 23 We therefore strongly suspect that all three Folio additions to 1.3 are genuine authorial expansions. Only one major Folio addition remains as a candidate for censorship (4.1.103-39; TLN 1969-2005). These Folio lines seem even less objectionable than the Archbishop's speech in 1.3. They have no possible relevance to the 'Bishop of Dublin', and only the last 2½ lines could be interpreted in terms of the Earl of Essex—and they could, of course, be cut without damage to the remainder. Even if a particularly timid reader took exception to the middle of Westmorland's first speech ('Construe . . . Griefe on'), it too could have been cut, leaving a transition so seamless that no one could have suspected corruption ('O my good Lord Mowbray , were you not restor'd . . .'). The remainder of the passage could only have been censored if objection were being taken to any reference to Richard II. Those who have proposed censorship as an explanation for Q's 'omission' have posited such a desire to remove all references to Richard; but, as we have said, this conjecture can hardly be reconciled with Q(b) addition of 3.1, and in any case reference to Richard seems to have played no part in the censorship of the two most suspect 'omissions'. Instead, references to the earlier plays in the tetralogy seem to have been added at a later stage by Shakespeare himself. In other respects, too, the content of this passage links it with Shakespeare's expansions: an elegiac preoccuption with the past, with the unpredictability and fickleness of fortune, with the irrational behaviour of the populace, with political betrayal (here, Richard's of Mowbray). We therefore doubt that the passage here printed in F should have suffered wholesale excision by the censor of Q. However, something may have gone wrong with the text of Q: West . There is no neede of any such redresse, Or if there were, it not belongs to you. Mowbray why not to him in part, and to vs all That feele the bruises of the daies before? And suffer the condition of these times, To lay a heauy and vnequall hand Vpon our honors. West . But this is meere digression from my purpose. (4.1.97-103) Westmoreland's 'But this is meere digression' certainly makes more obvious sense in F, where it occurs in the middle of one of his own speeches. On the other hand, it could simply represent Westmorland's desire to break off these unprofitable recriminations in order to make the offer he has come to deliver. If Q were our only text, this is how the line would be interpreted and defended; no actor would have any difficulty communicating that interpretation. If something has been lost from Q, it would be most easy to believe that what stood in the foul papers differed substantially from what stands in F: either because it was more objectionable than the extant text (and so was deliberately censored) or because it was much shorter (and so was accidentally omitted). It seems to us safest to assume that Q reproduces the foul papers accurately, and that the whole passage is another of Shakespeare's expansions of his political material. Of the nine substantial passages not present in Q(a) it appears that only two have suffered deliberate excision because of their political content: 1.1.189-209 and 4.1.55-79. This is much less interference than Hart and Dover Wilson suspected. The traditional explanation for the nine passages not present in Q(a) is that all nine stood in the foul papers, and were omitted for three separate reasons, through the actions of three separate agents: printing-house inadvertence (3.1), theatrical cuts marked in the foul papers (1.1.166-179, 1.3.21-24, 1.3.36-55, 2.3.23-45), censorship by the Bishop of London (1.1.189-209, 1.3.85-108, 4.1.55-79, 4.1.103-139). By contrast, we suppose that only three passages present in the foul papers were omitted from Q(a), and we have reduced the agents of deliberate cutting from two (editors and ecclesiastical authorities) to one (ecclesiastical authorities; or possibly printer). 24 We propose that 3.1 was omitted because of a confusion in the manuscript, a confusion virtually inevitable if 3.1 were an added scene written on a separate leaf. This hypothesis not only produces a more economical account of Q; it also, we believe, usefully illuminates the relationship between Q and F. The multiple relationships of theme and content between 3.1 and six other passages added by F make it possible, and in our view likely, that all seven additions result from a closely-linked two-stage process of authorial expansion. Nor is it difficult to see why, in this particular play, expansion should have been called for. Harold Jenkins has plausibly conjectured that Shakespeare had originally intended to treat Henry IV's reign in a single play, and that his decision to write two did not come until fairly late in the composition of Part One . 25 More recently, attention has been drawn to how seriously Shakespeare's plans for Part Two may have been disrupted by the politically-imposed change of Oldcastle's name to Falstaff. 26 In beginning to write Part Two Shakespeare was therefore dealing with an enormously popular comic figure, but had little historical material left for development. By the time he finished his rough draft he seems to have decided that something must be done to expand the play's political material; he did so, in large part, by looking backward, emphasizing the links with his own earlier history plays. Hence all the additions come in the play's first 2000 lines (out of 3300), before John of Lancaster's entrance at Gaultree. From this point on, the play can look to the future: the defeat of the rebels, the death of Henry IV, Hal's accession, his rejection of Falstaff (and of the past generally). Shakespeare's additions cannot have been made because his first draft was too short—it was already 3000 lines long. What apparently disturbed him was not the absence of sufficient matter, but the balance of different kinds of matter. What should an editor do? One could edit Q(a), conjecturally emending the text where it seems corrupt on its own terms and conjecturally adding (from F) only the two passages apparently censored. The resulting text would represent a reconstruction, as far as possible, of Shakespeare's foul papers, before he commenced his expansion of the political material. It would be harder to justify adding 3.1, because the composition of 3.1 seems merely to have been the beginning of a unified and conscious process of revision which culminated in the addition of six other passages of a similar nature. But it seems equally misleading to accept these six added passages from F, without seriously considering every Folio variant as a possible authorial revision. Naturally, many of the 'literary' features of F—the Act division, the wholesale excision of profanity, the smoothing out of colloquialism—seem most unlikely to originate in a (conjectural) fair copy made by Shakespeare in 1597-98. The Folio text undoubtedly derives from a highly sophisticated scribal transcript, at some considerable remove from Shakespeare's papers. It probably also suffered from unusual circumstances in Jaggard's printing shop. Nevertheless, it seems to us hard to deny that it derives from a text which represented the culmination of a process of conscious revision initiated even before a fair copy was begun. Any editor who abandons F has decided to leave the text in a state Shakespeare himself found unsatisfactory.</field>

Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History (1955), pp. 266-267; The Second Part of King Henry IV , ed. A.R. Humphreys (Arden Shakespeare, 1966), pp. lxviii-lxx. Act-scene-line references are keyed to Humphreys's text. 2 See Shaaber, pp. 499-515. 3 See, however, Gary Taylor's 'Zounds Revisited: Editorial, Theatrical, and Literary Expurgation' (forthcoming), where it is argued that Q could not have been used as printer's copy for F. This was also the view taken by Shaaber ('The Folio Text of 2 Henry IV' , Shakespeare Quarterly , 6 [1955], 135-144), J. K. Walton ( The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare , 1971), and George Walton Williams ('The Text of 2 Henry IV : Facts and Problems', Shakespeare Studies , 9 [1976], 173-182). 4 For the fullest description of the resetting see Thomas L. Berger and George Walton Williams, 'Variants in the Quarto of Shakespeare's 2 Henry IV' , The Library , VI, 3 (1981), 109-118. 5 Eleanor Prosser, in Shakespeare's Anonymous Editors: Scribe and Compositor in the Folio Text of '2 Henry IV' (1981), infers that 'the error was not caught until about half the edition had been printed. At that point, presumably, presswork was stopped and the new lost scene added' (p. 9). Probably unintentionally, this statement suggests that the entire play was printed in a single process, rather than forme by forme. Even if Prosser meant that 'half the affected pages' had been printed, the situation she envisages is unlikely, since the affected pages fall on both the inner and outer forme of sheet E: unless one press was printing the outer forme while another printed the inner, it would not be possible to stop the presswork when 'half the edition' of both formes had been printed. 6 Shakespeare and the Homilies (1934), pp. 175-218. In part, Dover Wilson supported this view: see his edition of Part Two (New Shakespeare, 1946), pp. 119-123. 7 'The Cancel in the Quarto of 2 Henry IV' , Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild , ed. Charles T. Prouty, University of Missouri Studies, 21 (1946), 67-90. The compositor McManaway identified has since been identified in other quartos: see W. Craig Ferguson, 'The Compositors of Henry IV Part Two , Much Ado About Nothing , The Shoemakers' Holiday , and The First Part of the Contention' , Studies in Bibliography , 13 (1960), 19-29; Alan E. Craven, 'Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos', SB , 26 (1973), 37-60. 8 W. Craig Ferguson, Valentine Simmes (1968), p. 40. On 25 June 1603 Wise abandoned his career as a stationer, transferring most of his rights to Aspley; as McManaway notes (p. 74), a re-issue of 2 Henry IV , with Wise's name intact on the titlepage, is unlikely after that date. 9 This task would have been impossible without the assistance of Katharine F. Pantzer, who gave us advance access to the 'Printers' and Publishers' Index' data for Simmes from the revised Short Title Catalogue . We are also particularly grateful to A. L. Braunmuller (UCLA), G. B. Evans (Harvard), Andrea Immel (Huntington), Nancy Maguire (Newberry, Folger), J. L. Steffenson (Dartmouth), Eugene Waith (Yale), and to the librarians of Magdalen College (Cambridge), the University of Durham, Glasgow University, Winchester College, the John Rylands Library (Manchester), the National Library of Scotland, and the Boston Public Library, who have examined for us copies of books which we could not check for ourselves. 10 There are some superficially similar watermarks in Hotman's Ambassador (1603; Bodleian), STC 13848; Dekker's I Honest Whore (1604; BL), STC 6501; and Smith's Three Sermons (1601; Bodleian), STC 22736; but on examination all proved to be demonstrably distinct. We have examined, or received reports upon, all copies of 2 Henry IV except those at Princeton, Geneva, and Lambeth. The Lambeth Palace copy is lost. Berger and Williams based their collation of press variants on a microfilm; the original had disappeared by the mid-1950s, when Dr. E. G. W. Bill became Librarian. One of the British Library copies (C.34.k.12) was falling apart; we were fortunate to be allowed to examine it in a disbound state before it was removed for restoration. For Ado we have examined, or received reports on, all but the Geneva copy, and the four 'seriously defective' copies which have never been collated. 11 W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of English Printed Drama to the Restoration , I (1939), 274; J. H. Smith, 'The Composition of the Quarto of Much Ado About Nothing' , SB , 16 (1963), 11-12. Smith also identifies one of the types from the cancel running titles in the new skeleton used in Ado H-I (p. 14). 12 See Taylor, 'King Lear : The Date and Authorship of the Folio Version', in The Division of the Kingdoms: Shakespeare's Two Versions of 'King Lear' , ed. Gary Taylor and Michael Warren (1983), pp. 415-422, and Taylor's introduction to his Oxford Shakespeare Henry V (1982), pp. 24-26. 13 But compare the textual histories of The Malcontent and A Fair Quarrel ; for fuller information see George K. Hunter's edition of The Malcontent (1975), pp. xxiii, xxxviii, and R. V. Holdsworth's A Fair Quarrel (1974), pp. xxxix-xliv. 14 'The Variant Settings in II Henry IV and their Spellings', TLS , 21 October 1920, p. 680. 15 Geoffrey Bullough, ed., Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (1964-75), IV, 254-256. 16 'Of all the scenes belonging to the main or serious plot this has the least importance and could be omitted without much injury to plot or play' (Hart, p. 196). 17 This too was first suggested by Hart in the paragraph on p. 196, only to be dismissed as implausible 'for certain reasons to be stated later'. 18 We do not believe Q served as primary copy for F or for the scribal transcript behind F, though a copy of Q was probably occasionally consulted by the scribe preparing the transcript. Even if a copy of Q(b) played a more active role, the strength of the input from an independent source is such that a scribe or compositor would have rectified such an obvious error in Q(b) as a mislocated scene. 19 Hart, p. 198. Hart notes this as an objection to the actors omitting the entire scene. 20 Ludwig Tieck first noted that 'the serious part is entirely subordinate to the comic', and that Shakespeare 'himself feels the defects of his plan and consequently he brilliantly emphasizes certain passages, such as the king's monolog at the beginning of Act III . . .' ( c. 1794; in Tieck's Das Buch über Shakespeare , edited by Henry Lüdeke (Halle, 1920), pp. 225 ff; cited in English by Shaaber, p. 568). 21 The Malcontent , pp. xxviii-xxxi; Jowett and Taylor, 'Sprinklings of Authority: The Folio Text of Richard II' , SB , 38 (1985), 195. 22 I Sir John Oldcastle (STC 18795) was entered on 11 August; 2 Henry IV and Much Ado on 23 August; The Earl of Gowries Conspiracie (STC 21466) on 11 September. Of these four books the last entered was probably the first printed. Gowries Conspiracie narrates events which took place 'vpon Tuesday the fift of August 1600', and includes a deposition dated '22 August'. It was obviously a hot item: the revised STC identifies a second issue (21466.3), 'partially reset and reimposed', and Simmes would almost certainly have given the title his highest priority. The three plays were therefore probably printed after September, but before March; indeed, one suspects that if they were printed after December all, or at least some, of the copies would have been dated '1601'. As one might expect, there is considerable overlapping of watermarks between the three plays entered in August. Simmes's Compositor A set most, if not all, of Oldcastle (as he set all of Ado and 2 Henry IV ), as is evident from his distinctive treatment of speech prefixes and stage directions. The watermarks of Simmes's reprint of The First Part of the Contention (STC 26100) overlap with both Oldcastle and The Shoemakers Holiday (STC 6523), but Holiday has no marks in common with the three plays entered in August. Moreover, Ferguson's watermark 10/2 appears in a deteriorated state in Gowrie , Oldcastle , and 2 Henry IV ; the undamaged state, visible in 1599 books, appears also in Contention . One therefore suspects that the order of presswork on the five plays Simmes printed in 1600 was Holiday , Contention , Oldcastle , 2 Henry IV , Ado —though it is of course possible (indeed, likely) that the five plays were interrupted by other work, and not printed one after the other. 23 'Shakespeare's Revised Plays: King Lear and Othello' , The Library , VI, 4 (1982), 142-174 (pp. 169-170). 24 The Lambeth Palace Library copy of Q did not reflect late Elizabethan interest in the publication: the book is not listed in the catalogue of Richard Bancroft (the library's founder; the catalogue was compiled on 15 October 1612), nor in that of his successor (compiled in 1632). 25 The Structural Problem in Shakespeare's 'Henry the Fourth' (1956).

      <field name="heading_text">The Growth of Robert Thornton's Books by Ralph Hanna III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Thornton was a gentryman who lived at East Newton, about fifteen miles due north of York City. Over an indeterminate but obviously protracted period, probably in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, Thornton spent a substantial amount of his leisure as a collector and copyist of Middle English literary works. Thornton's tastes were extremely catholic, ranging from romance narrative to religious prose and medical recipes; his copying is particularly important in providing us with texts known from no other sources, most notably the alliterative poem Morte Arthure . 1 Thornton's literary remains, as we know them, survive in two large miscellanies, Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91 and British Library MS. Additional 31042. The separateness of these two codices is, however, deceptive. Both were prepared in the same format, on quires of rather uneven size formed of broad-sheets folded in folio; moreover, five paper-stocks appear in both volumes, an indication that the copying was, at least in part, contemporaneous. Although Thornton clearly composed his volumes out of booklets or fascicles, 2 each established on a broadly generic basis, no one has yet made any effort to speculate exactly what procedures Thornton followed in creating these codices. In this essay I hope to offer such an hypothesis about how Thornton worked. I want to begin by offering a concise statement of the production data known about the two codices—the limits of the quires and booklets, the nature of the paper in each. From this data and some initial linguistic information about two of Thornton's exemplars, I believe it is possible to construct an account, albeit a messy one, of how Thornton proceeded in producing his various booklets.

Long ago, Angus McIntosh demonstrated that Thornton derived both the alliterative Morte and the prose work called The Privity of the Passion from an exemplar which was probably copied in southwestern Lincolnshire. 8 In addition, McIntosh was able to identify linguistically a second Thornton exemplar, this one from the area near the junction of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Nottinghamshire. From this second exemplar, Thornton derived a large number of works, including the romances Octavian , Isumbras , Diocletian , Percival of Galles , and The Siege of Milan ; the prose Abbey of the Holy Ghost ; and the two alliterative debates Winner and Waster and The Parlament of the Thre Ages . One's thinking about how Thornton acquired materials and how he went about copying them can begin with a salient fact. As George Keiser has pointed out, 9 the two works which Thornton acquired together in the Lincolnshire exemplar both open booklets in the manuscript now at Lincoln Cathedral (the Morte appears on ff. 53-98 v , The Privity on ff. 179-189). This seems to be more than merely fortuitous, and probably the Lincolnshire exemplar was acquired by Thornton very near to the start of his copying career. If one looks more closely at the second booklet of the Lincoln ms., into which Thornton copied the alliterative Morte , another interesting pattern emerges. The copying begins with a quire entirely on the paper-stock B; this is succeeded by a quire on stock B mixed with stock L and next by a quire entirely on stock L. The Privity of the Passion , together with a succession of further short religious pieces, appears in the first of two full quires entirely of stock L at the head of Booklet III of the Lincoln codex. From this disposition of paper-stocks, one can make two inferences. First, the pattern of papers at the start of Lincoln Booklet II suggests Thornton was running out of stock B at the time of copying: the gradual emergence of stock L as the normal form in which to write the codex seems predicated on a steadily diminishing supply of the other stock. This fact implies that Thornton copied the alliterative Morte first; only when this text (and stock B) was finished did he turn to The Privity and the pieces of religious prose which follow it. A second inference is possible because stock B does not occur uniquely in Lincoln Booklet II. Other texts which appear on stock B must be contemporary with the alliterative Morte in copying, since they must preceed the exhaustion of this stock. Two such patches occur in the codices: quire 9 later in Lincoln and quire 3, which opens Booklet II in the London ms. As the two codices are now bound, quire 9 appears near the end of the same booklet as the Morte ; however, this quire appears at some point in its history to have been independent and to have begun at the current f. 154. It could then, originally, have formed a single-quire fascicle. 10 It appears that Thornton acquired the texts on these folios— The Awntyrs off Arthure (literarily, a pendant to the Morte , yet lacking the spelling forms which typify the Lincolnshire exemplar) and The Northern Passion —at a time very near his gaining the Morte . But both relevant quires are comprised totally of stock B; in consequence, their production may in fact have been completed by the time Thornton began copying from the Lincolnshire exemplar. Indeed knowing The Awntyrs and recognizing it as dependent upon an alliterative Death of Arthur may well have stimulated Thornton into seeking out an exemplar like the Lincolnshire. It is further conceivable that The Northern Passion and the text which follows it, The Siege of Jerusalem , may have had some loose attachment to The Privity . One of the few parallel copies of this last work survives in a Yorkshire manuscript with The Siege —a Robert H. Taylor ms. at Princeton. 11 Having identified the Lincoln ms., Booklets II and III, as materials likely begun early in Thornton's career as copyist, one can move through these early booklets to examine their possible connections with other materials in the manuscripts. In this regard, study of the romances fascicle, the second in the Lincoln volume, suggests that copying proceeded contemporaneously on this fascicle and the religious prose. Both Lincoln quires 8 and 11-12 share stock L. However, by the time Thornton finished off the booklet of devotional prose, apparently very little of stock L remained: two sheets occur, stuck into quire 15, as if they were odd leaves only useful to fill out a quire. The completion of the romance booklet seems to indicate other materials were being copied contemporaneously. Quire 7 contains two sheets of stock C, which appears elsewhere in the London Booklet IIa (quire 4, also romances) and at the end of the Lincoln devotional book (quire 15). In addition, quire 10, which concludes the booklet, is on a mixture of stocks A, E, and K. This seems to place its composition after London Booklet I, where the Cursor Mundi extracts appear entirely on stock A; the mixture of stocks E and K recalls, and presumably indicates composition contemporary with, Lincoln Booklet I, where the Life of Alexander appears. The romances in both manuscripts appear to have been copied straight on, since many of them reflect a single source, the Doncaster exemplar. Thus Thornton would have copied Octavian , Isumbras , and Diocletian (Lincoln ff. 98 v -122 v ) in direct succession; at this point, with the acquisition of at least one other exemplar with desirable texts, 12 he seems to have decided to join the independent fascicle, Lincoln quire 9, with these other romances. This change involved refolding the quire to catch runover from these texts following on Diocletian ( St. Christopher , Degrevant , and Eglamour ; with some intervening blank pages, ff. 147-153 v , filled in later). Thornton then used the folios following The Awntyrs off Arthure to begin Percival , another text he had discovered in the still-retained Doncaster exemplar. Extension of the romance quire in the London ms. also involved copying from the Doncaster exemplar. The Siege of Milan shows the same dialect forms as the other romance texts; presumably, given the paucity of Charlemagne materials in Middle English, the adjacent romance Roland and Otuel reflects a common exemplar (even though it lacks distinctively Doncaster spellings). And ff. 271-276 v of the Lincoln MS., containing The Abbey of the Holy Ghost , is also on stock C and a text from the Doncaster exemplar; it comes at the end of the Lincoln devotional book, although, as we will see, it need not for that reason have been copied last. The production of the romance quire in the London ms. may have been less straightforward than the Lincoln romances. Quire 4 may have begun as fourteen leaves, largely on stock C, originally a size calculated to handle only The Siege of Jerusalem . Thornton would have produced a larger quire by suppletion, inserting into the original leaves extras which extend the writing area; this extension involves the unique examples of stock D and enabled Thornton to continue on with the Charlemagne materials. At the end of the subsequent quire, the fifth in the London ms., Thornton may have used a few originally blank leaves (ff. 94-96) to copy in short poems. Also contemporary with the romance books is Booklet IV of the London ms. This fascicle contains the two alliterative debates, which Thornton again obtained from the Doncaster exemplar. This quire is written on stock J, which indicates production possibly a little later than the preceding Booklet III. This textual section begins with a quire all of stock H, then succeeded by one completely of stock J. The devotional fascicle of the Lincoln ms. (Booklet III) may have involved considerable exemplar shifting. Some of this material appears to have had rather narrow ranges of circulation or to have circulated as units quite distinct from some of the other materials included. This feature suggests that Thornton may have had access to some small booklet-like exemplars or may have made eclectic choices of groups of texts reaching him from discrete sources. Several such units may be pointed out. At the end of quire 12, and overlapping the boundary into quire 13, is a brief sequence of Walter Hilton texts— Angels' Song , Medled Life , and an excerpt from the Scala (ff. 219 v -230). 13 A second such unit occurs at the end of quire 13 and again crosses the quire boundary, the sequence of texts known elsewhere as Gracia Dei (ff. 233 v -250 v ). A third group of texts with an independent pattern of circulation are the brief bits of Rolleana on ff. 192-195. And finally there is the group of Rolle lyrics which the Lincoln ms. shares with Longleat 29 and Cambridge Univ. Library Dd.v.64. But although Thornton may have relied on a sequence of exemplars, the copying of this portion of his texts seems to have been generally straight-forward. The only exception to this statement is Lincoln quire 15. This unit, as George Keiser has persuasively suggested, may have begun as an 18 (ff. 253a [now lost], 254-261, 271-279), all on stock C. To follow Keiser, this would have been an independent fascicle, beginning at f. 271 with The Abbey . Eventually leaves were added to the quire, after it had been refolded, in order to accommodate St. Jerome's Psalter (ff. 258 v -269 v ), a text copied only later. These additions were of two sorts—first a pair of sheets of stock L were quired within the extant quire. That there are only two sheets of L suggests that the additions occurred at the very end of Thornton's supply, after the completion of quires 11 and 12. The other addition, two half-sheets on the unique stock N, is probably secondary: Thornton may have had trouble gauging how much space he needed to finish off the Psalter and associated prayers, his unique piece of copying in Latin. The extreme abbreviation of his exemplar might have confounded his best efforts at estimating how many leaves the piece would occupy. Only two portions of Thornton's copying remain undiscussed. Quires 16 and 17 of the Lincoln ms. are utterly independent and on a single unique paper-stock. These may well be much older than the remainder of the manuscripts and indeed Thornton's first essay at copying. The paper-stock is of a type which would have been available from 1413 on; in contrast, the remainder of Thornton's papers, insofar as they are datable, suggests that the scribe's main work was in the period roughly 1430-49 or perhaps slightly later. 14 Booklet IIb of the London ms. is written on stocks G and E. This mixture suggests copying during the extension of the Lincoln romances, where stock G appears in quire 7. This copying would also be contemporary with use of stock E at the very end of the romances (Lincoln quire 10) and with the copying of Lincoln Booklet I. Additionally, such copying would be absolutely contemporary with the extension of the devotional materials into quire 14 of the Lincoln ms. (a quire fully on stock G). This reconstruction suggests that retailoring quire 15 may have been one of the last steps in the preparation of the manuscripts. To summarize, one can cast these inferences into a tabular form which indicates the history of Thornton's copying efforts. The distribution of booklets into groups put into different codices presumably was a decision made at the end of production, if the separate manuscripts indeed reflect any of Thornton's behavior at all and are not later arrangements. 15 Copying proceeded in the following order: 1. Lincoln Booklet IV, perhaps many years before the remainder. 2. More or less contemporaneous undertaking of four new booklets, two from the Lincolnshire exemplar: Lincoln Booklet II (quires 4-6), Lincoln Booklet II (quire 9, at this point an independent fascicle beginning at f. 154), London Booklet IIa (quire 3), and Lincoln Booklet III (quire 11). The last is probably slightly later than the rest; London Booklet IIa and Lincoln quire 9 probably predate Lincoln quires 4-6. 3. Extension of Lincoln Booklet III, derived from a variety of exemplars, continuing on an indeterminate basis throughout the following steps (quire 14 is as late as step 9 below). 4. London Booklet III could have been transcribed at any time before the copying of London Booklet IV from the Doncaster exemplar (5 below). Given the absence of overlap with paper-stocks used in the productions described in 1-3 above, I have placed this production at the latest possible point: it could be contemporary with some portions of 5. 5. Copying of texts derived from the Doncaster exemplar, more or less contemporaneously, into four booklets, two new and two extensions of preexisting units: Lincoln Booklet II extended (quires 6-7), Lincoln Booklet III (quire 15, at this point an independent fascicle beginning at f. 271), London Booklet IIa extended (quires 4-5), London Booklet IV. 6. During this period, from unidentified exemplars, Thornton acquired the texts of Lincoln Booklet II (quire 8); he subsequently reversed quire 9 to handle their text runover. 7. Before he relinquished the Doncaster exemplar, Thornton copied London Booklet I from a different exemplar. 8. Further copying from the Doncaster exemplar to conclude Lincoln Booklet II (quires 9-10). 9. Copying of two new units, Lincoln Booklet I and London Booklet IIb, is contemporary with the preceding step. 10. Lincoln quire 15 reversed so as to join the remainder of Booklet III, and St. Jerome's Psalter copied into its new and expanded first half. This chronology scarcely can be argued to bring order out of chaos. Rather, it suggests a particularly complex set of procedures: typically Thornton seems to have worked contemporaneously on four or five emerging fascicular manuscripts. He was remarkably flexible in his methods. None of the larger booklets was absolutely completed until Thornton arrived at the end of all his copying: each was capable of extension and of melding with other units, so long as new texts could be acquired. The only rule, not a particularly rigorous one, which Thornton seems to have followed was that each fascicle contained works which were generically homogeneous. 16 But if the chronology as I sketch it seems complicated, one should remember that my model in fact must simplify. It does so by a silent assumption that Thornton's use of paper is motivated, rather than arbitrary or irrational. I assume that Thornton received his materials from the paper merchant in lots comprised of a single stock and that he routinely used these stocks straight through until they were exhausted. In my account, Thornton only mixed stocks when his supply was running out. The alternative to this view would be a proof, based on an extensive survey of surviving English paper manuscripts, that mixed stocks (and especially mixtures within single quires) represent a commonplace and expected feature. Second, my account surely simplifies in presenting only the copying Thornton performed which has survived. There is no reason not to expect extensive losses, which would presumably add to the difficulty of any chronology of copying. This analysis, besides providing a chronology, also suggests some conclusions about Thornton's access to sources, his exemplars. Minimally, he must have been able to get to his hands on at least fifteen separate manuscripts, possibly as many as twenty. These would have included: 1. an archetype of the medical recipe book 17 2. the Lincolnshire archetype 3. the Doncaster archetype 4. between four and eight archetypes for various materials in Lincoln Booklet III 5. an exemplar of The Awntyrs off Arthure 6. an exemplar of The Northern Passion , possibly with The Siege of Jerusalem attached (both perhaps with exemplar 2 above) 7. two separate exemplars for the works of London Booklet III 8. three separate exemplars for the longer texts of Lincoln quires 8 and 9 9. an exemplar of Cursor mundi 10. an exemplar of the Life of Alexander 11. an indeterminate number of exemplars for briefer verse texts, most of these religious, written into London Booklet IIb and used as page fillers elsewhere (notably within Lincoln quire 9 and at the end of quire 10); some may have overlapped with other exemplars used elsewhere, Thornton putting materials into different fascicles on generic grounds. These speculations suggest a considerable acquisitiveness. However, there is some suggestive evidence that this acquisitiveness was practiced within a very narrow range and that Thornton participated in a lively local literary culture. McIntosh has noted Thornton's slackness at converting materials written in other dialects into his own. That most of the materials in the two manuscripts do not seem to show signs of having come from other dialects implies that Thornton obtained them locally, written in a dialect homogeneous with his own. The works may not have been composed in that dialect; but their circulation within it implies a considerable provincial literary culture in north Yorkshire, one about which we know very little indeed. 18 It may be that this effort at suggesting the order of Thornton's copying will allow further inferences about that culture.</field>

The paper-stocks were identified by Sarah M. Horrall, "The Watermarks of the Thornton Manuscripts," Notes and Queries , 225 (1980):385-386; when I use the term "paper-stock" I mean to identify one of Horrall's separate watermarks. Below I italicize watermarked folios; all half-sheets except London f. 144 and perhaps Lincoln ff. 268-270 are the result of cancels or lost leaves and are not original. 4 An error in the original Scolar collation of the quire was noted by Keiser; see Owen, "The Collation and Descent of the Thornton Manuscript," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 6 (1975):218-225, further corrected on provenance by Keiser, "A Note on the Descent of the Thornton Manuscript," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 6 (1976):346-348.

Thompson, "The Compiler in Action: Robert Thornton and the 'Thornton Romances' in Lincoln Cathedral MS. 91," in Derek Pearsall ed., Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England (1983), pp. 113-124. 5 Keiser, "'To Knawe God Almyghtyn': Robert Thornton's Devotional Book," in James Hogg ed., Spätmittelalterliche geistliche Literatur in der Nationalsprache (2 vols.; Salzburg: Institut für Anglistik, 1984), II:103-129, makes a number of important suggestions about this booklet. He proves its integrity (as against Brewer, who wished to divide it into three separate booklets) and gives revised collation diagrams with paper-stocks marked; these include new interpretations of quires 13 and 15. 6 This collation, revising that of the facsimile, was proposed by Thompson, "Textual Lacunae and the Importance of Manuscript Evidence: Robert Thornton's Copy of the Liber de Diversis Medicinis ," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 8 (1982):270-275. 7 For contents and discussion, see Karen Stern, "The London 'Thornton' Miscellany," Scriptorium , 30 (1976):26-37, 201-218. Horrall, "The London Thornton Manuscript: A New Collation," Manuscripta , 23 (1979):99-103, was the first to attempt a collation: since all the leaves are now mounted individually, such an effort is entirely dependent upon pairing watermarked and unwatermarked leaves.

L. Wrenn eds., English and Medieval Studies presented to J. R. R. Tolkien (1962), pp. 231-240; the body of the article discusses the Lincolnshire exemplar, the second being mentioned pp. 231-232 and 231, n. 3. For convenience (and with no claims for geographical accuracy) I simply refer to this source as "the Doncaster exemplar." 9 "Life and Milieu," pp. 177-179. 10 See Thompson, "The Compiler." 11 The only description occurs in A. I. Doyle, "The Manuscripts," in David A. Lawton ed., Middle English Alliterative Poetry and its Literary Background (1982), pp. 93 and 143-144, n. 18. 12 These three romances appear to have circulated together in other exemplars than the Doncaster; they recur several times in the same manuscripts, e.g. Cambridge Univ. Library Ff.ii.38; British Library, Cotton Caligula A.ii; and Bodleian Library, Ashmole 61. In contrast, the romance texts which follow in quires 8-9 may well have been derived from separate exemplars: the St. Christopher is unique, and Degrevant appears elsewhere only in Cambridge Univ. Library Ff.i.6 (the Findern anthology). 13 See Keiser, "'To Knaw,'" pp. 105-107. Keiser discusses "þe Holy Boke Gratia Dei" at Viator , 12 (1981):289-317. 14 These dates depend on Horrall's identifications of the paper-stocks. P, the unique form of Booklet IV, is associated with Briquet 7903-7904, stocks first recorded 1413, but with variants to as late as 1442. All the other datable paper-stocks belong to the period 1427-1444. 15 The Lincoln ms. could reflect a binding done for or by Robert Thornton; at least, down to 1832, the manuscript had what sounds like a fifteenth-century binding of oak boards with white leather. See Sir Frederic Madden, Sir Gawayne: A Collection of Ancient Romance-Poems , Bannatyne Club, 61 (1839), p. Ln. 16 Some of the rules governing disposition of religious pieces into different fascicles are worth noting. The booklets now in the London ms. all seem to have been conceived as verse collections; in any event all prose was reserved for the Lincoln Booklet III. London fascicles also seem to have been reserved for fairly extensive religious poems with a narrative content; Lincoln tends much more toward the lyrical in its verse pieces. Anything smacking of Rolle was saved for Lincoln as well. Generally, as Keiser has suggested, London fascicles seem to have been thought of less as materials for devotion than as "salvation history." Even the romances of London Booklets IIa and III have a strongly religious ethos, a crusading spirit. 17 Some discussion of this archetype occurs in Keiser, "MS. Rawlinson A.393: Another Findern Manuscript," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 7 (1980): 445-448. 18 Keiser, "Life and Milieu," pp. 167-177; and "More Light," pp. 114-118, offer the most detailed speculations on Thornton's local suppliers so far attempted.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Production of Cambridge University Library MS. Ff.i.6 by Ralph Hanna III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The manuscript usually called "The Findern Miscellany" (Cambridge University Library Ff.i.6) has long been recognized as one of the most important vehicles for fifteenth-century poetry. 1 Often considered an example of the spread of London poetic taste into the hinterlands, it was copied in south Derby, almost certainly in a gentry household during the third quarter of the century. Recently, in a rich and carefully delineated study, Kate Harris has provided the most extensive annotation to date of how the manuscript was produced—an elaborate discussion which lays out in full the evidence of quiring, of the watermarks of the papers used, and of scribal stints. 2 As a result of her intricate studies, Harris departs from what has in the past been received wisdom as to the major outlines of production of Ff.i.6. Most researchers have believed that the manuscript is essentially fascicular (only Edith Seaton thoroughly demurred), that it was produced as a sequence of separate booklets and only belatedly, probably at binding, gathered into its current form. Although there has been some discrepancy in various scholars' identification of booklets and their boundaries, their general agreement is clear. Harris, on the basis of a considerably more intense look at the evidence than that made by any past codicologist, rejects this view in favor of the opinion that the manuscript essentially can be seen as reflecting a single act of production, shared among a great many hands. 3 In this article, I want to show that the evidence which Harris adduces instead directly supports the older view of booklet production. Harris finds two principal ways to question that the volume was produced as a series of separate booklets. She looks for overlap among putative booklets of scribal stints or of materials, the thirteen separate paper-stocks used in producing the codex. Finding such overlaps, she assumes that they could not occur were the manuscript not produced as a single unit, and thus she rejects the fascicular theory. But inherently, neither of these features, scribal overlap or reuse of paper-stocks is, in itself, telling. Although booklets in manuscripts may well be distinguished by the fact that separate scribes have written different chunks of the work or by the fact that different writing materials occur in separate blocks, the negatives of these two propositions are not necessarily true. That is, the presence of a single scribe in different portions of a manuscript does not, a priori , mean that he is not contributing to separate booklets, nor does the repetition of a paper-stock in different portions mean that all those portions are of a single origin and copied as a planned and unified whole. 4 Moreover, the data which Harris has so attentively assembled render either of these conclusions rather unlikely. The scribal stints in the volume suggest a variety of copying practices, ranging from the carefully rational to the thoroughly whimsical. The use of paper-stocks appears similarly diverse: some quires contain only a single stock, often unique to the textual unit, whereas others have mixtures of stocks. In this context, all other issues aside, one might wish to adopt a flexible view of the modes of production. The scribal copying of the manuscript palpably reflects a variety of situations. These Harris recognizes. Some items she believes might be thought of as "main texts," works always planned to occupy their folios in Ff.i.6. These are implicitly singled out by Harris's notation that other texts can be immediately classified as either "filler" or "added items," i.e. works written-in later on originally blank folios. Such a view suggests at least two levels of composition within the volume, one formal and one less so. But even within formal stints distinctions can be drawn. Here I simply point at two extremes. The romance Sir Degrevant (item 27) was plainly copied from a split exemplar by two scribes (21 and 22, apparently women— Elizabeth Cotton and Elizabeth Francis). One copied into the end of quire G a substantial portion of the text, while the other copied the remainder into the head of quire H. The join in the two stints may not have been very accurately computed, since the last leaf of quire G has been cancelled, without loss of material: the scribe of G probably did not receive enough copy to fill her quire completely. But in any event, as in several similar examples, the scribal procedure is planned and, generally speaking, carefully executed. 5 As an immediate contrast, one might consider the two preceding texts, excerpts from Gower's Confessio Amantis (items 25 and 26). These were copied by five scribes total—two worked on both texts, three in company with them only on the second item. The copying proceeded by a succession of alternations which generally do not respect even folio boundaries; in some cases the stints are as short as seven or eight lines and thoroughly unmotivated by any normal detail of production. In this case, and others which approach it, 6 one is forced to assume highly unstructured procedures—either copying as a sort of social game, where the archetype and in-production codex were passed about in a gathering for successive additions; or copying by leaving archetype and in-production codex out (on a table, say) for chance additions by any interested members of the household. Because of such variations in the manufacture of the codex, it is difficult to view scribal behavior as so carefully controlled as it is in a professionally produced text. The reappearance of scribes may simply reflect the rather off-hand methods of production which the Finderns (or whatever family produced Ff.i.6) followed in creating their miscellany. In any event, the hands which recur in different sections of the manuscript provide no definite information that those sections are actually continuous, much less planned continuous, productions. 7 The evidence of paper-stocks is similarly rather tenuous. In fact, leaving aside one ambiguous case (quire A) which I will discuss below, only one stock is repeated in pieces of the volume usually considered separate booklets —stock 4 (which recurs in quires D, E, K, O, and P). But in fact all that this evidence may indicate is that the Finderns at one time had a substantial amount of stock 4 and utilized it repeatedly. Certainly, the thirteen stocks clearly present in the volume imply a paper supply highly mixed. In this regard, the case of quire K is instructive: this ten-folio unit would, in the quarto format of the codex, have required a half-sheet. The watermarks indicate the quire is comprised of portions of three sheets, two of stock 4, one of stock 9; the preceding quire, and the three which follow, appear totally on stock 9. Here the stock 4 simply appears to be a remnant, perhaps including a half-sheet which otherwise would have been wastage, mixed with a stock in greater supply at the time of copying. If the mixture of scribal hands and of paper-stocks does not provide convincing evidence of nonfascicularity, one may inquire whether other evidence exists which would suggest in some positive way that production has proceeded by booklets. Here, one can invoke a series of criteria associated with fascicularity and ask whether "The Findern Miscellany" provides any examples of these features. Following arguments I have made elsewhere, 8 the following preliminary questions would seem appropriate: 1. Does the manuscript contain any units which seem separate on the basis of bearing self-contained texts? 2. Do these units correspond to any independent set of quire signatures? 3. Do these units correspond to variations in the number of sheets per quire, particularly quires at the ends of such units being either deliberately long or deliberately short in order to contain the end of a text exactly? 4. Do these units end with leaves originally blank, even though these may now have later items added or may now be cut away as wastage? 5. Do these units correspond with variations of the paper-stocks on which the codex has been written? The manuscript, on a contents basis, consists of eleven self-contained units. These are: quires A, B-C, D, E, F-G-H, I-K-L-M, N, O, and P, and two extraneous units which have been inserted into quires of separate manufacture, bb (ff. 22-28 within B) and e (ff. 64-67 within E). 9 In each of these cases texts run continously within the units, regularly crossing the boundary of the folio or (in larger units) the quire; but at the end of each such unit, there is no text runover. But identification of textually self-contained units remains only a preliminary step in marking off fascicles. One needs to confirm this textual evidence with further, codicological detail. Here some problems emerge, because Findern lacks a number of features which manuscripts more professionally conceived routinely include. Thus questions 2 and 3 offer virtually no help in identifying potential fascicles—the manuscript is devoid of actual signatures and shows such persistent variation in quire size as to allow no conclusions about whether final quires have been tailored to accommodate the conclusion of textual units. 10 More helpfully, the manuscript offers a rich array of potential or actual concluding blank leaves. In some cases, these leaves have to be inferred, since they have either been cut out (presumably original blanks removed for some different writing purpose) or now bear texts (presumably added later, as a way of avoiding apparent wastage, in a hand not in evidence in immediately proximate portions). A simple listing of the occurrence of such leaves immediately suggests correspondences with boundaries of the textual units singled out above: 1. At the end of bb, f.28 v was originally blank and item 11 written in later (see n. 7 above); this feature suggests that bb forms a fascicle. 2. At the end of C, f. 43 is a stub and f. 44 has been completely excised; this feature suggests that B-C at least form a fascicle. 3. At the end of D, f. 59 v was originally blank (it now has a legal note not included in the contents list and clearly later) and f. 60 has been excised; these features suggest that D forms a fascicle. 4. At the end of G, an unnumbered folio between ff. 99 and 100 has been excised. This feature has been discussed above: it reflects, not a fascicle boundary, but the effort at regularizing the mid-text border between two scribal stints. 11 5. At the end of H, ff. 114 and 115 have been excised; this feature suggests that F-G-H form a fascicle. 6. At the end of L, an unnumbered folio between ff. 136 and 137 has been excised; the text does run over, in the same scribal hand, and there is no text loss. This feature, not at a putative booklet division, will require further explanation. 7. At the end of M, ff. 140-42 have been excised (f. 140 is a stub); this feature suggests that I-K-L-M form a fascicle. 8. At the end of N, ff. 162 r and f. 164 v are blank; f. 163 is a stub. In spite of the texts on ff. 162 v and 164 r and various other obscurities in the production of this monster quire, these features suggest that N forms a fascicle. 12 9. At the end of O, f. 178 v is blank (f. 178 r , now with item 61, may originally have been) and f. 179 has been excised; these features suggest that O forms a fascicle. (By extension, the concluding quire P must also be a fascicle.) This evidence singles out eight units (B-C, bb, D, F-G-H, I-K-L-M, N, O, and P) as very likely fascicles, making a total of nine when joined with the second independent inserted quire e. Further confirmation of these units comes from the evidence of the paper-stocks. As I have already suggested, the reuse of stocks in different booklets does not necessarily prove that production proceeded continuously. However, paper-stocks can offer positive evidence for the presence of booklets: units produced on single paper-stocks or on unique paper-stocks possess an integrity which marks them off from other portions of the codex. Such units occur with frequency in Ff.i.6: 1. A-B-C share stock 1; this feature brings into question whether simply the textual independence of A is sufficient to claim for it the status of a separate fascicle. 2. bb, inserted in B (stock 1), is written on the unique stocks 2 and 3; this feature confirms the evidence of quiring in suggesting that bb is an independent fascicle. 3. e, inserted in E (stock 4), is written on the unique stock 5; this feature confirms the evidence of quiring in suggesting that e is an independent fascicle. 4. F-G have in common stock 7 (F also includes a unique sheet of stock 6). H contains the separate unique stock 8, but given the shift of scribal stints at the boundary of quires F and G noted above, this variation simply reflects the paper available to a scribe who may not even have copied in physical proximity to other producers of the manuscript. But the common and unique stocks suggest a separate fascicle. 5. I-K-L-M are almost entirely on the unique stock 9 (with two sheets in K of stock 4, as noted above); this feature suggests that these quires form a fascicle. 6. The complex quire N (see n. 11 above) contains three unique stocks, numbers 10-12; this feature suggests that N forms a fascicle. 7. O is mixed, part on stock 4 but part on the unique stock 13; this unique stock suggests that O forms a fascicle. This evidence confirms a number of the units already singled out above— at least B-C (ignoring for a moment the status of A), bb, e, F-G-H, I-K-L-M, N, O. Only quires D and P, on the ubiquitous stock 4, are not again confirmed by this evidence; certainly one should take the seven units above as definitely produced as separate fascicles, and D and P as probably so. One is left with a few problem areas, some soluble, some not. Two units, the quires A and E, are textually self-sufficient but confirmed as fascicles by no other evidence; some further investigation of the possibilities here seems in order. And the end of quire L contains a cancelled leaf which also requires discussion. Quire A remains thoroughly ambiguous. If one were to insist upon the evidence of textual disposition as paramount, it would certainly comprise a fascicle; on the other hand, the paper evidence suggests it belongs with B-C in a single unit. The latter view seems to me the more compelling; the quire parallels F-G in providing extensive selections from Gower at the head of a textual unit. But even this evidence is not entirely unambiguous: the independent D also opens with a Gower selection. Quire E, like quire D, is on stock 4, and it lacks any evidence of being tailored at the current end of the quire. But it does contain one peculiar feature—an originally blank leaf in mid-quire, f. 70; this leaf now bears an inventory not included in the contents list and clearly later. Moreover, the preceding text, Index of Middle English Verse number 2279 (item 23), also appears to be a later addition, on the blank lower portion of f. 69 v beneath the conclusion of Chaucer's Venus (item 22). This confirmation of items looks suspiciously like the conclusion of a fascicular quire. In fact, it is perfectly possible that quire E originally ended at f. 70, since this leaf with its conjoint f. 71 is the exact center of the quire; as occasionally happens, 13 the quire may have been refolded so that its original first leaf became the first leaf of its second half. This possibility is enhanced by the contents of the second half of the quire. The six leaves contain a single work, Hoccleve's Epistle of Cupid (item 24). Inclusion of this work at the head of the quire would follow a tendency frequent in Findern (and indeed central to the production of fascicular manuscripts generally)—the opening of a fascicle with a substantial and important work. 14 Moreover, the appearance of this work at the head of the quire might also explain the current truncation of the text. The Findern copy of The Epistle of Cupid , related to the misarranged copies of the so-called "Oxford group," lacks twenty stanzas at the close. 15 Assuming that the work originally opened the quire, the codicological unit would have had to be at least a 16, not the current 12. The missing stanzas would then have occupied parts of the two central bifolia, now lost, and the quire would have run ff. 71-76+four lost leaves+ff. 61-63, 68-70. Loss of leaves would have been facilitated by the refolding of the quire; the resulting form would have been the extant 12 (ff. 61-63, 68-76) followed by a loose quired pair of bifolia. Especially since it contained a blank leaf, whose excision could have led to the loss of its conjoint as well, such a small extra piece of text might have been susceptible to being misplaced or suppressed as a fragment of uncertain origin. 16 The refolding of E, if it occurred, may have been a late decision associated with the binding of the fascicles into a codex. It may have seemed appropriate at that time to place the succession of short texts which conclude quire D beside the similar short texts at the end of quire E. If one accepts that such a refolding occurred, then there is evidence for E as an independent fascicle, and the last four leaves, had they survived, would have appeared a short, fascicle-ending quire. However, if one does not accept the idea of a refolded quire, the situation is somewhat more murky. If the Hoccleve poem was a complete copy, E must have been followed by a small additional quire (at least a 4, partially blank). In this case, it would have clearly comprised a fascicle separate from D. But if The Epistle was always a fragment, there is no reason not to believe that E formed a single fascicle with the adjacent quire D, with which it shares a paper stock. But if D and E belong together, then given the tailoring of the conclusion of D, their original order must be reversed: E would lead into the concluding D, rather than the inverse. 17 The cancel at the end of quire L reveals some of the extemporaneous decisions by which "The Findern Miscellany" achieved its current shape. The fascicle, which now comprises quires I-K-L-M, originally consisted only of the first three of these units, ff. 117-36 (plus the leaf now excised). Virtually the entirety of this sequence of quires (down to f. 134 v ) was taken up with the copying of La Belle Dame sans Mercy (item 30). At this point the quires were presumably set aside as complete; shortly thereafter, someone excised the old final folio, considering it a useless piece of waste at the end of a completed fascicle. However, this vandalism was followed by a decision to extend the textual unit, a decision of some promptness, since the unique stock 9 continues into the newly made quire M. In effect, L ends with a superseded fascicle boundary, now obscured by the addition of new texts (items 31-39; item 32 crosses the quire boundary). In addition, quire M, originally a 6, might be construed as a short, fascicle-ending unit. Thus the physical evidence Harris so carefully assembles makes clear that the production of Ff.i.6 proceeded by fascicles. The exact number of these separate units cannot be determined absolutely. There were at least nine such and perhaps as many as eleven: minimally A-B-C, bb, E-D, e, F-G-H, I-K-L-M, N, O, P; at most A and an expanded E were also of separate genesis. This complicated shape, with its frequent and tantalizing remnants of projected modes of production later cancelled, seems typical of that informal creation of literary artifacts which one associates with the aristocratic menage, not the stationer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It was, for example, the second manuscript chosen for publication in full facsimile by Scolar Press: Richard Beadle and A. E. B.

P. x gives a full schematic collation, accurate except for quire N (see n. 12 below), and pp. xix-xxx the contents list which I follow. For convenience, I give here the corrected collation of the manuscript; the quires are unsigned, and the library's foliation includes provision for some hypothesized lost leaves: A 10 (__A1,2) B 16 (__B1-4; B10+bb 8 [__bb1]) C 10 (__C9,10) D 16 (__D10,11,16) E 12 (E3+e 4 ) F 8 G 12 (__G12) H 16 (__H15,16) I 4 (__I1) K 10 L 8 (__L8) M 6 (__M4-6) N 6 (N3+n 4 +nn 8 ; N5+nnn 4 [__nnn4]) O 14 (__O14) P 8?

Ff.1.6," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 8 (1983):299-333; all statements I make about paper-stocks, scribes, or quiring depend on Harris's astute account, especially her appendices (pp. 327-333). Her article supersedes such earlier studies as Aage Brusendorff, The Chaucer Tradition (1925), pp. 187-190; L. F. Casson, The Romance of Sir Degrevant (EETS 221, 1949), pp. xi-xv; Rossell Hope Robbins, "The Findern Anthology," PMLA , 69 (1954):610-642; Gisela Guddat-Figge, Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Middle English Romances (1976), pp. 90-94; Richard L. Greene, The Early English Carols (2nd edn., 1977), p. 322; and Edith Seaton, Sir Richard Roos (1961), pp. 85-92. Of particular interest are the general but trenchant comments of John Scattergood, "The Authorship of 'The Boke of Cupide,'" Anglia , 82 (1964):137-149, at pp. 140-143. 3 "Origins," pp. 312-318; nevertheless, Harris concludes (p. 316) that only quire N is a separate production and that the manuscript developed "in the manner of an album, a loose-leaf album" (p. 318). 4 The reverse, a codex planned essentially as separable units with an overall plan only emerging in the course of production, seems to me inherent in the idea of the fascicular manuscript. 5 During the stint of scribe 21, the pages get progressively more crowded, apparently in an effort to finish at a folio boundary. Examples of similarly rational distribution of copy among two scribes occur in a prose chronicle (item 28, where scribe 23 was succeeded by scribe 24 in the middle of f. 112), La Belle Dame Sans Mercy (item 30, where scribe 6 copied the portions in quires I and L and helped out in mid-quire K, scribe 25 transcribing the remainder), and in The Parlament of Foules (item 12, where scribe 6 copied ff. 29-36 r and scribe 7 ff. 38 r -42 v ; the intervening portion shows some switching). 6 In addition to the alternation of scribes 6 and 7 within ff. 36 v -37 v and of scribes 6 and 25 in quire K, the other major example occurs in item 56, in the difficult quire N. An example comparable to all these occurs in National Library of Scotland, Advocates 19.3.1, in quire 6, the sixth of nine booklets; there three scribes shared copying (including one mid-item change of hand) and a fourth hand added an item at the quire end. See Phillipa Hardman, "A Medieval 'Library in parvo ,'" Medium Ævum 47 (1978), 262-273, especially p. 266. 7 Three or four scribes appear in one or more of the potential fascicular units. Scribe 9 is the doubtful case: he may have written the first two lines of item 33 (in quire M); in addition he wrote items 14 and 15 (in quire D). Scribe 4 wrote items 8-9 (B), 11 (bb), 35, and 37 (both M); at least the first three of these texts appear to have been written into blank leaves after the major production was finished, and quire M, as I will suggest later, was perhaps a similar afterthought. Scribe 11 copied items 17 (D) and 23 (E); the latter is probably a late addition on a blank leaf, and the two quires, it will develop, may form a single fascicle at any rate. The only scribe writing extensively in more than one possible fascicle is scribe 6: he shared the copying of Chaucer's Parlament (item 12; see n. 5 above) and La Belle Dame (item 30; see also n. 5), as well as copying Hoccleve's Epistle of Cupid (item 24) alone. He is the most prolific scribe in the volume, but interestingly, his contributions all begin at major textual breaks, a fact fully commensurate with fascicular production. 8 In "Booklets in Medieval Manuscripts: Further Considerations," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986):100-111 I suggest why mere self-contained texts will prove inadequate in identifying fascicles; I also attempt to prioritize various codicological details to suggest which are most persuasive in identifying fascicular units. These are, of course, the criteria which I invoke in the following pages. 9 Neither of these units can originally have been part of the quires because they sit as balanced sets of bifolia whose centers do not correspond with the centers of the large quires in which they are found—bb follows original leaf 10 of quire B 16 and e follows leaf 3 of quire E 12 . 10 Unusually, quire O is fully paginated (as a-z, &amp;, 9 on ff. 166-178 r ), another feature which marks its status as fascicle. As the collation given above, n. 1, indicates, no two adjacent quires originally contained the same number of leaves (the thirteenth quire began, not as N 6 , but as n 4 ; see n. 12). 11 In addition there is a blank page in mid-quire G—f. 95 v . This simply reflects the aesthetic preferences of the scribes—the desire to begin the next (substantial) work in a prominent position at the head of a recto. 12 This quire differs from B and E, which simply have insertions, and here the collation diagram of the Scolar facsimile must be supplemented by Harris's important new arguments based on the watermark evidence; see "Origins," pp. 315, 329. The leaves designated N are the conjoints 143+164, 144+159, 145+158. Ff. 143-145 and 164 all seem originally to have been blank; items 40-41 on ff. 143 v -145 r and 59 on f. 164 r (as well as 58 on f. 162 v ) all appear later additions. These outer leaves, I think, are actually wrappers, rather than the body of the quire later stuffed with additional sheets. Copying appears to have begun on f. 146, with item 42; scribe 32 copied this and eventually eight other works. He added to n 4 the second quire nn 8 to handle these texts. Additional scribes and texts filled this quire, and the whole unit ff. 146-157 was probably then placed within the two bifolia 144+159, 145+158, with copying continuing through f. 159 and beyond. This additional material necessitated a new quire, nnn 4 , together with yet another wrapping bifolium 143+164. The original copying ceased with item 57, which ends on f. 161 v . 13 See, for example, discussion of the two examples in Robert Thornton's ms. Lincoln Cathedral 91: John J. Thompson, "The Compiler in Action: Robert Thornton and the 'Thornton Romances' in Lincoln Cathedral MS 91," in Derek Pearsall ed., Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England (1983), pp. 113-124; and George R. Keiser, "'To Knawe God Almyghtyn': Robert Thornton's Devotional Book," in James Hogg ed., Spätmittelalterliche geistliche Literatur in der Nationalsprache , 2 (1984):103-129. 14 A fundamental purpose of fascicularity is to postpone, so far as possible, decisions about the ultimate shape of the codex in production. Such a goal is furthered by opening booklets with extensive texts and building up the manuscript out of sequences introduced by such substantial works. The last question the compiler will settle, probably only at the time of binding, is the actual order of these "top-heavy" units. Such a procedure occurs in vernacular codices very early on, for example in The Auchinleck Manuscript (National Library of Scotland, Advocates' MS. 19.2.1, c. 1340). 15 The authorial order of the poem may be determined from the holograph, Huntington HM 744. The prominent Chaucerian anthologies of s. xv med. called "The Oxford Group" (Bodleian Fairfax 16, Tanner 346, Bodley 638, here joined by Digby 181 as well as Ff.i.6), derived their text from a disordered archetype. This was an eight-leaf booklet in a typical five stanzas to the page format (excepting f. 1 r , with a heading and only four stanzas); at some point in its history, one of the bifolia came loose and was misbound so that the leaves were left in the order 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8. (For a different view, see Robbins, "Findern," PMLA , 69 [1954]:631, n. 119.) This disruption produces the distinctive "Oxford Group" order of stanzas 1-19, 30-39, 50-59, 20-29, 40-49, 60, 61-68 (with further internal disorder), followed, so far as the extant text extends, by Findern. 16 The library foliation, which includes the absent ff. 77-80, assumes a text loss at this point. 17 But on this basis, depending upon the vagaries of binding, it could as well have preceded quite O or quire P, also on stock 4.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">On the Eighteenth-Century Ownership of a MS of Chaucer's Legend of Good Women , British Library Additional 9832 by Constance S. Wright</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a note in SB (35 [1982], 154-155), Arthur Sherbo suggests that Samuel Pegge, an eighteenth-century antiquarian, probably did not own MS British Library, Additional 9832, containing Chaucer's Legend of Good Women , but "another but now lost version . . ." which was closer to the Additional ms than any other extant ms. An examination of the ms and the passages which Pegge quotes in a note in The Gentlemen's Magazine for June 1758 (pp. 260-262) suggests, however, that it is much more likely that Pegge owned the Additional ms than Sherbo supposes. At the outset, it should be pointed out that the only unique variant which Sherbo cites from the ms and Pegge's note is markidall (l. 222). This reading is correct for Pegge but incorrect for both Furnivall's transcription, which Sherbo uses as the basis for his comparison, and for the ms itself, both of which read makyd all . An examination of the ms and the citations in Pegge's note shows that they share a number of readings. The Additional ms was the only one containing the lines Pegge cites in private hands in 1758 and Pegge makes it clear that he had the ms from which he was quoting in his possession: "I have a MS, of this part of the author . . ." (p. 261). The lemmata for the comparison are from Bodleian Library, MS Fairfax 16, which contains much more conventional readings of the passages than do Additional 9832 or Pegge: 59 loved] lovith Ad P / hotter in his lyve] hartyer A lyve Ad; hartyer alyve P 60 eye] evyn Ad P / blyve] belyve Ad P 61 evere] om.

Ad P / fyne] fyne and Ad P 223 which] the w. Ad P 225 Considered] Considderith Ad P Thus in the twenty-six lines which Pegge quotes from his ms of The Legend —lines 59-64, 180-184, and 212-225—there are nineteen correspondences (with some trifling orthographic differences) between the Additional ms and Pegge. In four instances Pegge does not follow the Additional ms. In line 63, Fa and Ad read she , while P reads the ; in line 214 Fa and P read grene , while Ad reads of grene ; in 222 Fa reads I makyd al , Ad reads makyd al , and P reads markidall ; and in 224 Fa and P read sene , while Ad reads seme . Lines 63 and 222 may be mistranscriptions. With respect to the other two lines, John Urry's Workes of Geoffrey Chaucer of 1721 reads grene at 214 and sene at 224. In his note Pegge makes it clear that he had compared the readings of his ms with those of Urry's text (pp. 261-262). If Pegge wrote his collations in a copy of Urry, as did Timothy and William Thomas and an anonymous eighteenth-century bibliophile whose readings were probably from Additional 9832, 1 possibly Pegge's eye skipped from his marginal annotations to Urry's text itself while he was making the transcriptions for his note. Moreover, Pegge's quotations are lineated (and correctly), and Urry's is the first printed edition of Chaucer to employ lineation. For these reasons I think that it is much more likely that Pegge owned Additional 9832. It would also be interesting to know if Pegge owned Additional 9832 in 1758, since possession of that ms might indicate the whereabouts of MS Phillips 6570, containing fragments of the Canterbury Tales , with which the Additional ms was bound in 1745, but from which it was divided when the mss were sold from the library of Joseph Haslewood in 1833. 2</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Observations on the 1532 Edition of Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso by Conor Fahy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1532 edition of Ariosto's Orlando furioso was the last edition of this great work to be printed in the author's lifetime. It has always been regarded as of prime importance for the text of the poem, because it was printed under the author's eyes at Ferrara, where he lived, and, compared with earlier editions, contained numerous variants, as well as extensive new material. It thus comprised a new version of the work, intended to supersede that published for the first time in 1516, also at Ferrara, and reprinted there with minor changes in 1521, and then in a host of reprints, apparently unauthorized, which appeared in Milan, Venice and Florence between 1524 and 1531. 1 Only in the last half-century, under the influence of modern textual and linguistic criticism, and of structuralist and post-structuralist critical theory, which sees each version of a work as a discrete entity, of equal interest to, and indeed value as, any other version, have scholars begun to take an interest in the 1516 edition of the Furioso and its text. This modern scholarly interest apart, once the 1532 edition, with its numerous stylistic and linguistic changes and its six additional cantos, had appeared, it immediately became and has remained the basis of the reading text of the work. During these four hundred and fifty years of critical interest, an awareness has grown among Italian scholars that copies of the 1532 edition of the Furioso differ from each other in ways significant enough to affect the work of a critical editor. However, it was not until the critical edition of the Furioso published by Santorre Debenedetti in 1928 that a satisfactory account was given of these variations, and their nature explained. Though trained in a scholarly tradition almost entirely preoccupied with problems of manuscript transmission, and working before the appearance of the first manual of textual bibliography in any language, Debenedetti accurately identified the two sources of internal variants in the 1532 Furioso —authorial press-corrections and a cancelled sheet—and, hampered though he was by the centrifugal organization of the Italian library system and the inadequate cataloguing of sixteenth-century books in Italian libraries, and, of course, by working in the pre-microfilm era, he nonetheless succeeded in locating and collating all but two of the copies of the edition accessible to him in Italy at that time. Having re-traversed much of the ground covered by Debenedetti and become intimately acquainted with his editorial work, I have no hesitation in describing his edition as one of the masterpieces of modern Italian textual criticism. The editor's learning, intelligence, sensitivity and integrity shine from every page. Inevitably, however, his work has its shortcomings from the bibliographical point of view. In the first place, he did not understand the structure of the book, a quarto in eights; more fundamentally, though less surprisingly, he did not arrive at the bibliographical concept of state , but considered each press-variant in bibliographical isolation from all others, and without reference to its bibliographical context; finally, he left uncollated more than half the surviving copies of the 1532 Furioso . With these considerations in mind, I began a couple of years ago to re-examine the 1532 Furioso . The results, though still incomplete, have been extensive and, in some ways, surprising. A complete statement of my findings will be published in Italy in due course in book form; meanwhile, the present paper discusses certain points which seem to me to be of general interest. 2 My discussion begins with a general proposition concerning the Furioso , that the first edition of 1516 and the definitive edition of 1532 were both financed by the author. The evidence for this is circumstantial, as no contracts between Ariosto and the two printers in question, Giovanni Mazocco for the 1516 edition, and Francesco Rosso for the 1532 edition, have yet been found, but none the less its cumulative effect is convincing. It was first presented more than fifty years ago by Michele Catalano, author of a richly documented biography of the poet, whose arguments in this context, though occasionally unacceptable on points of detail, are generally valid. 3 We begin with a letter from Ariosto's master and the dedicatee of the Furioso , Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, brother of the Duke of Ferrara, addressed to the Marquis of Mantua, dated 17 September 1515, requesting permission for the transport across Mantuan territory free of tax from Salò, on the shores of lake Garda, of 1000 reams of paper, "as I am about to arrange for the printing of a book by my servant M. Ludovico Ariosto". 4 There is no doubt that this is a reference to the forthcoming first edition of the Furioso . The letter, which is preserved in the Mantuan archives, is in Ariosto's handwriting, and I agree with Catalano and others that the Cardinal had probably provided Ariosto with no more than a signature to help him obtain exemption from customs dues for his paper. Even if he also furnished financial support, it is clear from other epistolary evidence that he left detailed arrangements for the production of the edition to his "servant". It was the author, for example, and not the Cardinal, nor the printer, who arranged for privileges to be obtained from the Pope, the Doge of Venice and others. 5 On 7 May, 1516, just over a fortnight after the completion of the printing of the first edition of the Furioso , 6 a Mantuan courtier, Ippolito Calandra, wrote to the son and heir of the Marquis of that city, who was in France, telling him that two days previously Ariosto had arrived from Ferrara with a case of books containing his new work, the Orlando furioso . He had presented copies to the young man's father, mother and uncle; the rest he was proposing to sell. Calandra added that when the poet put the copies up for sale, he would buy one, get it bound and send it to France for his young master. 7 Whether Ariosto sold the copies himself, or entrusted their sale to a local bookseller, it is clear that they belonged to him. This is confirmed by another letter, this time from Ariosto himself, written to Mario Equicola, secretary to the Marquis of Mantua and a fellow author, dated 8 November 1520. In this letter the poet acknowledged the receipt of a sum of money resulting from the sale of copies of the Furioso in Verona (with the comment, which authors of all periods will sympathise with, that it was less than he expected), and asked his friend to arrange for the Verona bookseller to return to him any unsold copies, because none seemed available anywhere else in Italy, and he could not satisfy the daily requests he received. 8 In the light of this letter, we can understand why there was a new edition of the work in 1521, though so far no similar evidence has come to light of the author's direct involvement in its publication. 9 With the 1532 edition, however, we are back on familiar territory. We have letters to the Doge of Venice and to the Ferrarese ambassador at the Milanese court requesting privileges for the new version of the poem, and a letter to the Duke of Mantua (the young man for whom Calandra had bought a copy of the 1516 edition, who had succeeded his father in 1519, and been elevated to the rank of Duke by the emperor Charles V in 1530) asking for free transport across Mantuan territory of more paper from Salò. This time the letter is written by the poet in his own name, and the amount of paper specified is 400 reams, which, if it is the quantity actually bought and used, would give a print-run for the 1532 Furioso of about 3000 copies. 10 The colophon of the 1532 edition is dated 1 October. Within three months Ariosto was seriously ill. He never recovered his health, and died on 6 July 1533. It is not surprising, then, that this time we have no evidence of his having been personally involved in the sale of his work. But we have ample evidence that this edition, too, was his property: the most striking, and the best known, is a letter from his brother Galasso written a few days after the poet's death, in which he complains that because of the poet's illness and death three quarters of the edition still remains in the hands of his heirs, unsold. 11 I have dwelt on the evidence for the personal involvement of Ariosto in the Ferrarese editions of his masterpiece because it undoubtedly helps to explain the interesting features of the 1532 edition, as they emerge from the interpretation of the evidence provided by the collation of the surviving copies. The three features which I wish to discuss in this paper are: the press-corrections; the cancelled sheet; and the existence of perfect copies of the edition, consisting only of sheets in the corrected state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The press-corrections In the Nota at the end of the third volume of Debenedetti's 1928 edition of the Furioso the editor lists and discusses thirty-seven variants which have emerged from a collation of the eleven copies examined. 12 This list only contains variants relevant to the constitution of the text. In Debenedetti's working material, there is an unpublished list of thirty other variants, many of which are not relevant to the constitution of the text, e.g. they concern the correction (or the inadvertent creation) of printing errors. At the time of writing, I have collated ten of the eleven copies utilized by Debenedetti (the present whereabouts of copy no. 4 in the list in Appendix A is unknown) and the copies numbered 12 to 23 in the same list. The number of press variants of which I currently have note is 282. Of the new variants some fifty per cent are of Debenedetti's second type, those not relevant to the constitution of the text; the rest are stylistic or contenutistical variants which, like the thirty-seven variants in Debenedetti's Nota , cannot reasonably be attributed to anyone other than the author. The extent of the phenomenon can perhaps best be shown by relating it to the structure of the volume. As has been mentioned, the 1532 Furioso is a quarto in eights, with thirty-one gatherings, and so sixty-two sheets. My 282 variants are regularly distributed from beginning to end of the volume, and occur in ninety-one of the 124 formes needed to print it. This figure is the more impressive if one bears in mind that the sample on which I have been working is small—less than one per cent of the print-run, if the figure of 3000 is correct—and if I confess frankly that my collations have been selective rather than comprehensive. 13 It is reasonable to conclude that in the printing of this edition press-correction was normal, and that the collation of a bigger sample would lead to the discovery of press-variants in many, perhaps all, of the thirty-three formes at present without variants. For this, however, we must probably await the discovery of the whereabouts of further paper copies of the edition. Only seven of the sixty-two sheets which comprise the volume have no press-variants. Of the fifty-five sheets in which variants have so far been found thirty-six have variant states of both formes. Thus, it was certainly not the norm in the printing of this volume for the second forme of a sheet to receive its final corrections while the first forme was on the press. Presumably, a final proof of the second forme was not normally taken until perfecting had actually begun. But there is another aspect of the press-correcting which deserves comment. In seventeen of the thirty-six sheets with variant states in both formes, the uncorrected states of both formes (and consequently also the corrected states) only occur together, that is, in the same copy or copies. The number of copies involved is, in one case, one copy; in five cases, two copies; in four cases, three copies; in one case, four copies; in two cases, five copies; in three cases, six copies; and in one case, seven copies. Twelve of the sheets involved belong to the second half of the volume. The phenomenon assumes even greater proportions if we include "near-miss" cases, in which there is a difference of only one or two copies in the group of those with uncorrected (or corrected) states of both formes. This gives a further twelve sheets, again concentrated in the second half of the volume. Indeed, after gathering N there is only one sheet where there is not some close connection between the list of copies with uncorrected (or corrected) states for the two formes of a sheet. A much less extensive instance of this phenomenon was discussed many years ago in connection with seventeenth-century editions of Massinger's plays, and was taken to demonstrate an "orderly regularity in perfecting". 14 This assumes, of course, that all the edition of a sheet is printed on one side before perfecting begins. In the printing of the 1532 Furioso , the cases listed above involving a certain number of copies provide a substantial obstacle to the acceptance of this explanation. The presence of the uncorrected state of both formes of some sheets in a sizeable minority of the surviving copies suggests that there was a delay in proofing these formes, and it is stretching credence a bit far to require that the same length of delay which occurred in performing this operation on the first forme should also occur later, in the printing of the second forme. More consistent with the evidence in these cases is the hypothesis that both formes were corrected at the same time, after some of the edition had been printed and perfected. As for the "near-miss" cases, the obstacle which they present to the acceptance of this explanation can be overcome on the hypothesis that on some occasions the correction of the forme on the press was delayed until after printing had re-commenced. If the 1532 Furioso really did have a print-run of 3000, then the printing of a sheet would have been an operation barely possible to perform on one press in two full days of continuous work, let alone in one; in cases where the printing of a sheet did not start at the beginning of the working day, the operation would have spilt over into a third day. As a working hypothesis, I assume that the instances of copies bearing uncorrected states of both formes of a sheet indicate the gradual establishment, during the course of the printing of this edition, of the practice of not making the final corrections to the formes until after the end of the first day's printing, during which a portion of the edition of the sheet being worked had been printed and perfected. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cancelled sheet The regularity with which press-variants occur throughout the edition and, in particular, the nature of some of those which are clearly attributable to the author, involving words, phrases, and even whole lines, and, in one case, two consecutive lines, lead one to reflect on the reason for their presence. Given the quality of the Orlando furioso , its importance to the author, and the circumstances of its printing, I believe that they represent, not the main, but the final act of correction carried out by the printer and the author on the text of this edition. They are, as it were, the tip of the iceberg of correction; the bulk of the correction is invisible, hidden to modern eyes, because it was carried out on proof-sheets which have not survived; indeed, I would suggest that the surviving press-corrections are due, not only to eleventh-hour changes of mind, but also to the fact that the corrections carried out on the proofs were sometimes so extensive as to make it difficult for all of them to be correctly transferred to the type under the sort of pressure normal in early printing. 16 It would be nice to be able to produce, in support of this contention, one of the proof-sheets of the 1532 Furioso , discovered in those treasurehouses of rare finds, the libraries of Italy. I cannot do that, but I hope to persuade readers that I can do nearly as well, by demonstrating that the cancellandum of inner A is to be understood as representing, more or less, the text of that sheet as it appeared in the proofs. It was once again Debenedetti who first realised that the numerous variants to be found between copies in ff. A3-6—he lists approximately one hundred—were attributable to two different settings of type. 17 He argued that the readings in the first setting (Type I), while not identical with those of the corresponding stanzas of the 1521 edition (which edition, duly emended, served as printers' copy for the 1532 edition), nonetheless represented linguistic choices closer to those found in that edition than to those of the definitive edition; these latter were, however, completely in accord with those of the second setting (Type II). His argument is particularly significant in the linguistic context of sixteenth-century Italy. Ariosto, as a Ferrarese, spoke a dialect very different, phonologically, morphologically and lexically, from the Florentine which was the basis of the literary language, and the story of the three authorised editions of the Furioso is, inter alia , that of a substantial linguistic journey, marked by the inconsistencies of genius but whose general direction is quite clear, towards the adoption of a non-dialect standard based on the language of the Tuscan classics, as interpreted by the great Venetian writer and grammarian Pietro Bembo. Bembo's fundamental work on the subject, Prose della volgar lingua , appeared in 1525, between the publication of the second and third authorised editions of the Furioso . The language of the 1532 Furioso , considerably more "regular" than that of the 1521 edition, is consistent with itself, from start to finish of the poem—except in Type I of ff. A3-6, where there is a substantial regression towards the language of the 1521 version. 18 Debenedetti's explanation of this accident—for such it certainly is—was that some pages of the 1521 text used as printers' copy had been marked with provisional corrections, which, due to the author's absentmindedness ("era distrattissimo!", Debenedetti adds), he had never revised. As with Debenedetti's consideration of individual variants, this explanation engages the textual situation without paying any attention to its bibliographical context, but whereas for the press-variants Debenedetti's great sensitivity triumphantly carries the day (only one of his thirty-seven textual choices turns out to be contradicted by the bibliographical evidence), in the case of the cancelled sheet his lack of bibliographical awareness leads him into an untenable position. The 1521 and 1532 editions, though identical in structure—they are both quartos in eights—do not have the same disposition of text on the page: in the earlier edition each page has two columns of four stanzas, while in the definitive edition the text is arranged in two columns of five stanzas. Thus, none of the sheets of one edition contains exactly the same text as the corresponding sheet of the other edition, even in the first gathering, where there is no new material. In the 1521 edition the portion of text contained in inner A of the 1532 edition (Canto I, st.18-Canto II, st.14) begins at the bottom of the first column of a3r and carries on through to the top of a8r. Nor is the material of this portion a discrete textual unit: as anyone can see by consulting the text either in the original or in translation, the portion begins and ends in medias res . Obviously, Type I of inner A in the 1532 edition prints its not yet linguistically or stylistically mature text because that is what the compositor found in his exemplar, which, as has already been said, was a marked-up copy of the 1521 edition. 19 The crucial question is, what was the relation of the text in the relevant portion of the exemplar to the text it carried elsewhere? Debenedetti's explanation requires that, while for the rest of the work the exemplar should bear a text which, except for the press variants, (which, apart from one instance—the outer forme of outer C—comprise only a handful for each forme), had already reached the stage of linguistic and stylistic maturity witnessed by the definitive edition, for the seventy-eight stanzas in question, which comprise neither a discrete bibliographical nor a discrete textual unit in the exemplar, it should have a text which failed to reach this standard by such a long way that an average of nearly fifty corrections per forme had to be introduced in a new setting of type to bring it up to the same level as the rest of the work. In human affairs, nothing is impossible; for the historian, however, in his task of reconstructing the past out of the inadequate documentation which remains, it is the probable which counts. In the circumstances, what Debenedetti suggested is improbable. More probable is that the text represented by Type I of sheet inner A reveals the linguistic and stylistic condition of the exemplar not only in that passage but in the surrounding text as well; the reasonable assumption is, in other words, that all the text of the exemplar, at least in the early part of the work, presented this same provisional linguistic and stylistic quality. The reason why this provisional quality does not now show elsewhere in the 1532 edition, except in the press-variants, can only be that it was removed by extensive corrections carried out on proofs before printing began. Type I of sheet inner A thus represents the text of the exemplar before the author corrected the proofs, Type II indicates the nature and the order of the corrections he introduced into the proof-sheets. The fact that three of the four surviving vellum copies of the edition, which were presumably sent to Ariosto's patrons and influential friends as soon as printing was over, contain Type I of inner A suggests that Type II was printed after all the rest of the edition, after, indeed, an unknown number of copies had already left the printing-house. 20 What little can be gleaned from an examination of Type II does not contradict this suggestion. Though the running-titles of the 1532 Furioso are in general uninformative, and allow no firm deductions to be made concerning the pattern of printing (the verso running-title throughout the volume consists of the single word "CANTO", and the recto running-title, which contains the canto number—e.g. PRIMO, SECONDO, etc. up to forty-six—changes on average every one and a half sheets), A6r of Type II has the unique error "SCONDO", which shows that the inner forme of Type II was printed with a skeleton different from that used for the corresponding forme of Type I. 21 One can only speculate how Type I came to be printed. Perhaps the author was prevented by other commitments from correcting proofs for this sheet. More likely, I think, is the hypothesis that he made corrections, but that they failed to find their way into the forme. We are presumably at the very beginning of the printing of this edition; the printing house may not have yet settled into a proper rhythm for this job. 22 It is significant that, in addition to the cancel, the one sheet with numerous press variants—outer C—also belongs to the early gatherings of the volume. The high number of variants in its outer forme, twenty-three in all, suggests that here, too, the author's corrections had not been incorporated into the forme before printing began; in this case, however, the omission was noticed early in the press run (four of the copies examined have the uncorrected state, nineteen, including the vellum copies, the corrected state) and so did not require a cancel. 23 In postulating an Ur-text of the definitive edition of the Furioso entrusted to the printers' copy and requiring heavy correction to bring it to its final form, I am not suggesting anything which clashes with what we know of Ariosto's artistic practices or of his preparatory work on this edition. Like most writers, he was always dissatisfied with what he had written; the letter from his brother Galasso, already quoted, shows that even after the publication of the definitive edition he was thinking of further amendments. As for the preparation of the text of the definitive edition, he had certainly begun work by early 1528, the date of his request for a privilege from the Venetian authorities. In the swiftly changing climate of opinion on linguistic matters in sixteenth-century Italy, four years was a long time: solutions adopted early in the correcting process could easily seem in need of substantial modification when the work went to press. 24 One has to admit, however, that if Type II of sheet inner A was a cancel, intended to correct an oversight which had left some early pages of the text linguistically and stylistically disfigured, it was a very unsuccessful one. Of the twenty-four surviving copies listed in Appendix A only three contain the cancellans . I have no satisfactory explanation of why this should be so. I assume that it is connected with the fact that the author, who owned the edition and probably took responsibility for its distribution, as he seems to have done with the first edition, was afflicted with a fatal illness within three months of the completion of the printing. 25</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perfect copies of the 1532 Furioso When I embarked on this study, I expected that the numerous uncollated copies of the 1532 Furioso would reveal unrecorded states of some formes, which would allow me to make a contribution, perhaps an extensive one, to the constitution of the critical text of the work. These copies do indeed contain such states, with many textual variants, as has been said, yet I am unable to propose a single change to the text established by Debenedetti, because his text, in every case, already has the correct reading in these places. To understand how this is so, we must go back to Debenedetti's work on this edition. Having considered the thirty-seven variants affecting the reading of the text, and decided, impressionistically but with remarkable accuracy, which reading was to be preferred, Debenedetti then looked at the way those readings were disposed in the eleven copies he had consulted. He found that two copies (nos 9 and 10), though they differed in one variant for which he was uncertain of the correct reading, agreed with each other everywhere else, and always had the correct reading. Both copies, furthermore, had Type II of sheet inner A. Happily unaware of the view expressed by McKerrow in his Introduction , that "it is quite unscientific to speak of a more or less corrected copy of a book", 26 Debenedetti came to the conclusion that these two copies were superior to any other, and followed their readings in his text. In this he was helped by the fortunate chance that copy no. 10 was readily available to him, having been deposited by its then owner in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Debenedetti's home town, Turin, for his convenience. 27 Working from a much wider knowledge of the press-variants of the 1532 Furioso , I can only confirm Debenedetti's findings. While the other paper copies have a varying number of formes, ranging from nine to thirty, in their uncorrected state, copy no. 10 has none at all: all ninety-one formes with press-variants are present in their corrected state. The "perfection" of copy no. 9 is only slightly less: the only difference between it and copy no. 10 is the variant referred to by Debenedetti, which represents the second round of press-corrections on the inner forme of inner G. Given the number and percentage of formes involved, it is not possible to attribute the "perfection" of these copies to the workings of chance. Debenedetti described copy no. 10, somewhat ambiguously, as "large", and as "the only copy with margins intact". 28 Thanks to the courtesy of the present owner, I have been able to examine the copy recently, and have formed the opinion that it is printed on larger paper than the other surviving paper copies. This opinion is based on a comparison between the measurements of the margins in copy no. 10 and those of the spaces between the edges of the type-page and the edges of the sheets in copy no. 21, a complete copy in sheets of the 1532 Furioso . 29 We have only to posit the practice of running the large paper copy or copies through the press last of all in the printing of each forme to obtain a satisfactory explanation of why copy no. 10 always has the corrected state. The situation is not as clear in the case of copy no. 9, whose dimensions are approximately the same as those of the majority of other paper copies. It is possible, of course, that it is a large paper copy, like copy no. 10, which has been heavily cropped. However, in many sheets a countermark is visible in one of the corners. 30 There is also the fact of the variant reading in the inner forme of inner G. which differs from the reading of copy no. 10; the reading of copy no. 9 was taken off the forme in the first part of the run, to judge from the readings of surviving copies (six in agreement with copy no. 9, fifteen with the reading of copy no. 10). Inner G of copy no. 9 certainly did not go through the press at the end of the run, and is thus probably not a large paper sheet. If copy no. 9 is not a large paper copy—and that is the direction in which the evidence at present seems to point—then the author and the printer were able and willing, when making up complete copies, to differentiate between normal-sized copies of each sheet which had corrected states and those which had not, and to form copies on normal-sized paper of the whole work containing only corrected states. 31 It is surely significant that both copy no. 9 and copy no. 10 also have the cancellans of sheet inner A. 32 Ariosto was one of the greatest poets of the European Renaissance, and the Orlando furioso was his life's work. He published it in his home town, Ferrara, while in the employment of the Ducal family, who took a keen interest in the poem. He had the motivation and the means to ensure that the printing of his masterpiece was carried out under his close and continual supervision. The evidence suggests, as I have argued in the preceding pages, that, when publishing the definitive edition of his great work, he availed himself of these circumstances to receive and heavily correct proof-sheets, either of each forme, or of both formes of a sheet together, and that he arranged with the printer to have some copies made up consisting only of sheets in the corrected state. These are not unnatural requirements on the part of an author; on the contrary, for one as great as Ariosto, and in his enviable position, it would have been surprising if he had been content with less. 33</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 According to G. Agnelli and G. Ravegnani, Annali delle edizioni ariostee (1933), these unauthorized reprints numbered fifteen. This information needs to be re-examined in the light both of our present knowledge of sixteenth-century Italian printing, and of a proper distinction between the concepts of edition and issue, but, even if only approximate, clearly indicates the great success of the Furioso with its early readers. I take this opportunity of acknowledging the generous support of the British Academy, which enabled me to examine the copies of the 1532 Furioso in European libraries, and of the American Philosophical Society, which made possible a visit to the United States to examine the Harvard and Pierpont Morgan copies. A list of copies of the edition is given in Appendix A. 2 My examination of the 1532 Furioso has been selective, not comprehensive, and has focused on those elements of its printing history which are likely to prove especially interesting and instructive to my Italian colleagues (in particular, I have not carried out a detailed analysis of the type). It was occasioned by an invitation to participate in the II Seminario Internazionale sulla trasmissione dei testi a stampa nel periodo moderno , organised by the Lessico Intellettuale Europeo , a study group of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, and by the Università degli Studi della Tuscia, and held in Rome-Viterbo on June 27-29, 1985. The resulting paper was read to the Seminar on 28 June 1985 and will appear in its Atti . The present note is an English version, substantially re-arranged and rewritten, of that paper. 3 See M. Catalano, Vita di Ludovico Ariosto ricostruita su nuovi documenti (1930-31), I, 428-434; 595-605. 4 Catalano, II, 150-151. In fact, as Ariosto was to clarify years later, all that was actually ordered and received from Salò for the printing of the 1516 edition was 200 reams of paper, not the huge quantity mentioned in the Cardinal's letter, which seems intended to satisfy Arisoto's needs for many years. 5 Catalano, II, 149-150; L. Ariosto, Tutte le opere. Volume III. Satire. Erbolato. Lettere , ed. C. Segre, G. Ronchi and A. Stella (1984), 157-160. 6 The colophon is dated 22 April 1516. 7 The relevant part of the letter reads: "Non eri l'altro vene in questa terra mess. Ludovico Ariosto, gentilhomo ferrarese, quale à portato una capsa di libri, li qualli lui à composto sopra a Orlando, ch'è quasi tanto volume come l' Innamoramento di Orlando , et lui l'à intitulato Orlando Furioso , quale è uno bello libro, più bello che non è lo Inamoramento di Orlando . Lui ne ha donato uno al Ill.mo S. v.ro patre et uno a madama v.ra matre et uno al R.mo Cardinale; li altri lui li vole fare vendere. Se piace a la S.V. che io ve ne manda uno, io li mandorò ( sic ), perché io so che quella si dileta di havere di questi libri, maxime una Opera nova et così bella como è questa. Como lui li facia vendere, io ne comprarò uno et il farò ligare et il mandarò ala S.V." (Catalano, II, 158). 8 For this letter see Ariosto, Tutte le opere , III, p. 177. The relevant part reads: "Per m. Gian Iacomo Bardelone ho havuto sei lire di nostra moneta, li quali vostra M.tia mi ha rimessi, credo, per parte de li denari che si hanno d'havere dal venditore de li miei Orlandi a Verona. Di che ringratio quella, ma mi paron pochi a quelli ch'io aspettava; e non posso credere che quel libraro non li habbia expediti tutti, perché in nessuno altro luogo di Italia non so dove ne restino più da vendere: e se fin qui non gli ha venduti, non credo che più li venda. Per questo seria meglio che il libraro li rimettesse qui, perché subito troverei di expedirli, perché me ne son dimandati ogni dì." 9 There are, however, two contracts with booksellers, one in Genoa and the other in Ferrara itself, which suggest that the author owned the 1521 edition as he had owned its predecessor, but did not have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to concern himself in the same way with its sale (Catalano, II, 232-233; 236-237). There is also a fragmentary but highly suggestive document of March 1523 certifying the repayment by Ariosto of a loan apparently received in November 1520 "ad merchationem in arte stanpandi libros" (Catalano, II, 246). 10 For these letters see Ariosto, Tutte le opere , III, 452-453; 458; 461. The 1532 Furioso is a quarto in eights, collating A-Z a-h, and thus comprises sixty-two sheets. It is quite likely that Ariosto, with the eternal optimism of the author-publisher, envisaged an edition of this size. The first edition, which contained sixty-six sheets, would, if printed on 200 reams, as Ariosto stated, have comprised about 1500 copies; as has been said, it ran out in less than five years. Between 1516 and 1532 the Furioso had become famous throughout Italy, and beyond. 11 For the date of this letter, see C. Dionisotti, "Notizie ariostesche," Giornale storico della letteratura italiana , 106 (1935), 224-229. The text, with the erroneous date of 8 July 1534, is given in Catalano, II, 344-345. The relevant part of the letter reads: "Del quale privilegio ha potuto poco godere, perché, havendo a pena fornito di stampare, s'ammalò, et dopo l'essere stato VIII mesi infermo finalmente s'è morto, come V.S. havrà potuto intendere: et così non solo non ha potuto ristampare il libro di novo, come havea in animo di fare, parendogli, come era, d'esser stato mal servito in questa ultima stampa et assassinato; ma per la sua malattia sono restati i tre quarti dei libri in mano de gli heredi, che non si sono venduti." Other evidence is to be found in a draft of Ariosto's will made during his last illness, in which he left to his son Virginio "omnes libros intitulatos Orlando furioso ipsius D.ni Testatoris, existentes penes ipsam D.nam Alexandram [his wife] quotquot fuerint" (Catalano, II, 333). We also have a note in the Estense archives of the payment in March 1532 of 300 lire to Tommaso di Salò on Ariosto's behalf for the purchase of paper (Catalano, II, 323). 12 See Ariosto, Orlando furioso , ed Debenedetti (1928), III, 415-426. The figure of thirty-seven excludes the numerous variants found in the cancelled leaf, for which see below. 13 The decision to collate selectively rather than comprehensively was taken when it became apparent, for reasons which will emerge later, that my researches were not likely to make a significant contribution to the critical text of the Furioso . As my control I have used transparent xeroxes of the John Rylands copy (no. 14). I have collated word for word copies no. 6 and 13. For the remaining paper copies my approach has been to begin by collating those formes in which I had not yet found any variants, and then to collate other formes as the pattern of variants suggested and time allowed. Every one of the paper copies collated for the first time has yielded at least one state previously not documented. The copies on vellum (nos. 8, 11, 12, and 23) are not susceptible to collation by my control xeroxes, as the dimensions of their type-pages are several millimetres smaller than those of the paper copies, owing to the greater shrinkage rate of vellum over the years; consequently, I have collated them only spasmodically. There is no doubt that they were printed from the same setting of type and concurrently with the paper copies; indeed, one of the peripheral points of interest to have emerged concerning the printing of this edition is that in the opening gatherings the vellum sheets occasionally went through the press early enough to pick up uncorrected states of a few formes, but after gathering G, where in the inner forme of the inner sheet the group of vellum sheets went through the press after the first round of press corrections but before the second, the printers saw to it that the vellum sheets always went through the press late enough to avoid any uncorrected states, even in formes in which there was more than one round of press-corrections. 14 See A. K. McIlwraith, "Marginalia on Press-corrections in Books of the Early Seventeenth Century,", Library , 5th. ser., 4 (1950), 238-248. 15 On the hypothesis of printing and perfecting part of the print-run of a sheet as a day's work see P. Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), 132. 16 For recent presentations of the printing process in early continental printing see J. Veyrin-Forrer, "Fabriquer un livre au xvi e siècle," in Histoire de l'édition française , ed. H. J. Martin and R. Chartier, I (1982), 279-301; J. Rychner, "Le travail de l'atelier," ibid. , II (1984), 42-61. 17 Ariosto, Orlando furioso (1928), III, 406-414. The fact that Debenedetti regarded these four leaves as forming a "half-sheet" does not detract from his contribution to the solving of the problem they pose. Though the fount used is the same, the two settings of type are immediately apparent when one is superimposed on the other, as with transparent xeroxes, or with the Hinman Collating Machine. 18 This assertion cannot be documented without a thoroughgoing linguistic discussion, which would be out of place here. A few examples are: the treatment of double consonants (always a delicate matter in the language of north Italian writers) and of the diphthongs ie and uo , more "irregular" in Type I than elsewhere in the edition, and the presence of forms such as dui, altrimente, arricciosse , corrected to duo, altrimenti, arricciossi in Type II, in conformity with the language of the rest of the sheets of the 1532 edition. 19 This is shown by some forty shared misprints elsewhere in the work. Of course, for the additional material the author must have supplied manuscript copy. Some autograph fragments of this material have survived, though not the copy sent to the printers. 20 The fourth vellum copy, no. 11, the only surviving vellum copy with Type II of inner A, is a presentation copy for Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, and presumably remained at Ferrara in the weeks following the publication of the edition. It has a number of other peculiarities, including a non-typographical title-page and an unique setting of type for f. A2r, the first page of text. One of the vellum copies with Type I, no. 23, bears on a guard-leaf a note in a sixteenth-century hand stating that it was given by the author to the poetess Veronica Gambara, who lived at Correggio, some 50 miles from Ferrara; see my article, "L'esemplare già Charlemont dell' Orlando furioso del 1532," Lettere italiane , 14 (1962), 441-450. 21 I have so far been unable to identify the watermark of Type II in copy no. 9, the only Type II paper copy readily available. It is possible that analysis of the types would provide further evidence, but I doubt whether the effort involved (for which see A. Hammond, " The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 135-176, particularly pp. 159-161) would be justified in this case. 22 Another indication of an early lack of rhythm which was gradually eliminated as printing progressed can be found in the treatment of the vellum sheets (see note 13); also relevant is the gradual establishment of a pattern of press-correction, as discussed above. 23 The linguistic variants of this forme all refer to phenomena identical with those shown by the variants of inner A (see n. 18), e.g. insertion of the Tuscan diphthongs ie and uo ( rivera &gt; riviera , leva &gt; lieva , lochi &gt; luoghi , giova &gt; giuova ), -e &gt; -i ( pare &gt; pari ). 24 It is interesting that three hundred years later another great north-Italian writer, Alessandro Manzoni, in preparing the publication at his own expense of the definitive edition of his novel I promessi sposi , the text of which had been subjected to a similar process of linguistic revision lasting several years, stipulated, in a ferocious contract with his printers drawn up by a lawyer friend, the right, which he exercised to the full, to make as many corrections on the proofs as he thought necessary. Manzoni's contract, and many other documents concerning this edition, are reproduced in M. Parenti, Manzoni editore: storia di una celebre impresa manzoniana illustrata su documenti inediti o poco noti (1945). The edition was printed on one or more large Stanhope presses; numerous proofs, ranging from galleys to perfected sheets, are preserved in the Biblioteca Braidense, Milan; for further information, see my articles "Galley Proofs in an Italian Edition of 1840-42," The Library , 6th ser., 2 (1980), 469-470; and "Per la stampa dell'edizione definitiva dei Promessi Sposi ," Aevum , 56 (1982), 377-394. 25 During a discussion at the 1985 Seminar, and afterwards privately, Paul Needham expressed the opinion that the two typographical settings of sheet inner A of the 1532 Furioso , because of their distribution among surviving copies, were unlikely to represent a cancellandum and its cancellans , as both Debenedetti and I maintain, and should probably be attributed to the desire to produce further copies of the sheet. I have to admit that the distribution evidence, "arranged vigorously", to borrow a phrase from Dr Needham's memorable article on the printing of the Mainz Catholicon ( PBSA , 76 [1982], 395-456), does point in that direction. However, I believe that in this case the distribution evidence is outweighed by the bibliographical and textual considerations I have outlined, which are valid both against Debenedetti and against the theory of an increase in the print-run, and which, under the stimulus of Dr Needham's comments, for which I am very grateful, I have arranged as vigorously as I am able. 26 See R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), p. 209. The phrase also appears in the first version of McKerrow's manual, the article "Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors of English Works of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 12 (1914), 211-318. 27 I owe this information to Carlo Dionisotti, whose informant was Debenedetti himself. From the same source I understand that Debenedetti subsequently purchased the copy. Its present owner, Prof. Cesare Segre, is Debenedetti's nephew. 28 Ariosto, Orlando furioso (1928), III, 406. 29 On this copy see my article "A Copy in Sheets of the Orlando furioso of 1532," in course of publication in La Bibliofilia . The maximum margin measurements of copy no. 21 are 30mm for the bottom margin and 19mm for the outer margin, as against 35mm and 25mm in copy no. 10. My examination of the latter did not include the watermark, which is difficult to identify in quartos. Indeed, had it not been for the chance of finding a copy in sheets, I doubt if I would know for certain what the watermarks of the paper used for the 1532 Furioso were. Further work prior to the full publication of my results will include an attempt to establish the identity of the paper used in copies 9 and 10. 30 I owe this information to Luigi Balsamo. 31 The fact, as already stated, that paper copies other than copies 9 and 10 all have a varying number of formes, from nine to thirty, in their uncorrected state, coupled with the number of sheets involved (sixty-two), makes the unintentional assembly of a "perfect" copy implausible. 32 The fact that Type II of inner A is only present, among the paper copies, in the two which have all the corrected states of the rest of the volume is further, if indirect, proof that it was intended as a cancellans , and is not the result of a decision to run off further copies of the sheet. 33 For proof-reading in sixteenth-century continental printing, see the references in my article, "Introduzione alla bibliografia testuale," La Bibliofilia , 82 (1980), 151-180, especially pp. 167-168. As for perfect copies, even McKerrow, after the statement quoted on a previous page (see n. 26), expressed the following disclaimer: "I do not deny that it is possible that a few sheets in the most correct state might be selected to be made up into presentation copies for the author's friends," though adding "but I have certainly never come across any evidence of such a practice, nor does it seem at all likely" ( Introduction , pp. 209-210). A young British scholar, Neil Harris, is planning a study, similar to that which I have undertaken on the 1532 Furioso , on the printing of the 1516 and 1521 editions of the work, as part of a three-year perfezionamento at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa. 34 This list comprises copies of the 1532 Furioso utilized by Debenedetti or by me. From Debenedetti's notes, it appears that he located copies 20 and 21 too late to be able to incorporate their readings in his edition. Copies 15 and 16 did not become available for public consultation (indeed, copy no. 16 did not actually reach the Vatican) until after the publication of Debenedetti's edition. From information supplied to me in 1961 by the staff of the Houghton Library, Harvard, before copy no. 24 left their possession, it is clear that it belongs to Type I, but the rest of its readings are now unfortunately lost. The copies in this list are printed on paper, unless otherwise stated. Press marks are given in square brackets. I would be very grateful for information about copies of the edition not included in this list. I should add that the copy given in the Library of Congress Union Catalogue as belonging to the library of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute is a "ghost", and that the copies stated in the same source to be found in the library of Duke University are photocopies of some of the items listed here.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Significance of the "Tho" Signs in Wyatt's Egerton Manuscript by Joost Daalder</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Egerton MS 2711, in the British Library, is generally, and rightly, seen as the most important manuscript containing Thomas Wyatt's verse. It is the only manuscript which contains poems in the poet's own hand, and a number of others which are corrected by him. An important difference from other manuscripts is also that, while in them are found a good many poems which are definitely known not to be Wyatt's, there is a strong likelihood that—with some easily identifiable exceptions—all the poems in the Egerton MS (E) are by Wyatt himself. Nevertheless, there are some features about E which scholars have found rather puzzling. In particular, there has been considerable controversy about the question of authorship. Most scholars have assumed that, leaving aside the exceptions already referred to, all of the poems are Wyatt's, because there is a good deal of evidence that they are, and none that they are not. This view has not gone unchallenged, however. One central oddity about the manuscript is that several of the poems are accompanied by the marginal sign "Tho"—no doubt for "Thomas," the poet's first name. There is some disagreement as to whether someone close to Wyatt was responsible for these signs, or whether they are in fact in the poet's own hand. In either case, it might be argued (and has been) that "Tho" is offered as a sign of authorship, and that accordingly poems without "Tho" need not always be Wyatt's. This argument would seem to have even greater force if the "Tho" signs are indeed in Wyatt's hand, as I believe they are. Presumably, it runs, if the poet actually "signed" his own poems, to indicate which were his and which were not, he knew what he was doing; and in that case the poems which he did not "sign" were not his (except where the presence of his hand suggests otherwise). This argument would appear to be a weighty one, and it must be examined with some care for its validity. I intend to do so in this paper, but I also want to explore another possibility. In my view, "Tho" is not primarily meant to be a sign of authorship, although we may take it that an effect of its presence is that it confirms to us, in a later age, that a poem is Wyatt's. The poet's intention, however, was—I shall argue—not to indicate "This is a poem by me, Wyatt, and I want readers to know that" but rather to signal to a scribe who was meant to copy the "Tho" poems that these (not, or not yet, the other poems) could be proceeded with. But first it will be necessary to say something about the nature and make-up of E in general, so that the "Tho" marks can be considered within their context. E is a very unusual manuscript of early Tudor poetry in not being a miscellany. In his book The Courtly Maker (1964), Raymond Southall includes an "Appendix A" (pp. 160-170) which he entitles "The Egerton Manuscript Collection of Early-Tudor Poetry, c. 1530-1542," and an "Appendix B" (pp. 171-173) which is headed "The Devonshire Manuscript Collection of Early-Tudor Poetry, c. 1532-1541"—that is, Devonshire MS Add. 17492 in the British Library. These headings suggest not only that the manuscripts are of the same date, which they are, but also that they are the same in kind, which they are not. As for the Devonshire MS (D), we essentially agree. I still stand by what I wrote on p. xxiii of my edition, Sir Thomas Wyatt: Collected Poems (1975): "D shows the typical history of a court album. The MS. went from one hand to another, from scribe to scribe and from reader to reader. For this reason, and because D (like other MSS. but unlike E) contains many poems not by W[yatt], there is no particularly good reason for assuming that unascribed poems which happen to look like W's, in some or many respects, are his. Until they can be shown to be, they are strictly anonymous." By "unascribed" I meant "unascribed in D or elsewhere": I accept as Wyatt's poems ascribed to him in, for example, Richard Tottel's Songes and Sonettes (1557). But I see no reason why we must assume that the mere presence of a number of Wyatt poems in D implies that others are also by him. In fact, as Southall is right to point out (p. 172), D is really an anthology of work by a very mixed bag of authors, both early Tudor and much earlier. Authors who have been identified as occurring in D include Wyatt, Thomas Howard, Margaret Douglas, Mary Shelton, Anne Boleyn, Henry Stuart (Lord Darnley), Edmund Knyvet, John Hall, A.I. (insofar as these initials identify anyone), Jon K., Chaucer, Hoccleve and Roos. There is no such mixture of authors in E. Indeed, I see no reason for doubting that Wyatt was the owner of the manuscript, and from the beginning intended it to contain copies of his poems only. Physically, there is nothing against this view. With the exception of some leaves inserted in E to make good lost or damaged leaves, all leaves of E have a common watermark, and this, in addition to the fact that the grid measurements and the quality of the paper are the same throughout, proves that a common stock of paper was used. 1 Not many leaves are lost or damaged, and the fact that some are does not, of course, disprove the assumption that E was a bound volume of blank leaves when Wyatt acquired it and instructed the main scribe in E, an amanuensis whose hand is usually referred to as "A," to begin the task of copying poems which all available evidence suggests were Wyatt's own. Not all of the leaves were filled while the manuscript was in Wyatt's possession, and the fact that several were left blank but clearly belong to the same stock further confirms that E was a bound volume from the beginning. After Wyatt's untimely death in 1542, the manuscript passed through more than one pair of hands within a relatively short time; the poet Nicholas Grimald, for example, whose work is represented in Tottel's anthology, "edited" a number of Wyatt's poems by adding punctuation marks and tampering with the wording here and there. But, although in subsequent years E was not looked after with exemplary care and was added to by a variety of hands, its main character as a Wyatt volume remains plainly visible and intact. In their own fashion, various owners looked after the manuscript. For example, John Harington (the father of Sir John, the translator of Ariosto), who acquired E circa 1555, proceeded to have it rebound (as a result of which the manuscript was slightly trimmed), and the Haringtons kept E until about 1810, when it was bound again, under the direction of Wyatt's great early editor G. F. Nott. What I want to stress here is the unity of the manuscript. It was a bound "book" from about 1530; we need not fear that a collection of heterogeneous papers was bound together at a later date, or that what was originally a bound volume was subsequently split into smaller parts (of which the present manuscript might have been one). At present, a few old leaves are unnumbered, but the bulk is numbered 2-120; a modern 2 leaf precedes folio 2, and nine others follow folio 120. It is possible to calculate the number of leaves lost from the original section which is now numbered 2-120 as probably 18. 3 Some of them, at least, must have contained Wyatt material. The surviving material which I and others regard as Wyatt's occurs in sections as follows: ff. 4 r -70 r ; ff. 86 r -98 v ; and ff. 100 r -101 r . The fact that there are no Wyatt poems after folio 101 r is readily accounted for by the fact that the poet left the last poem, "Iopas' Song," 4 incomplete at his death. As for the other two gaps, the one between f. 98 v and f. 100 r may simply be due to Wyatt's habit of using space liberally, but it is harder to see why he left so much space between f. 70 r and f. 86 r . Some of this space is taken up by material which, although I do not think Wyatt exercised control over it, is nevertheless "Wyatt material" in another sense: on f. 70 r a later hand, almost certainly after Wyatt's death, entered a copy of his poem "Vulcan begot me, Minerva me taught," and this same hand proceeded to copy, on ff. 71 r -73 r , two letters by Wyatt to his son. 5 Whoever entered this material clearly thought of E as a Wyatt manuscript, but there is no accounting for the fact that the poet himself, finishing a poem on f. 69 v ("What rage is this? What furor of what kind?"), did not start his next poem, the beginning of the Penitential Psalms ("Love to give law unto his subject hearts"), immediately after. Nevertheless, as we have no reason for supposing that this gap was meant to include work by another poet, it is clear that, in principle, E was meant to be a Wyatt manuscript from beginning to end. That idea is reinforced if we examine the distribution of the hands in E. I am here concerned only with what happened while Wyatt was alive. I should point out, though, that there is a great deal of material in E which post-dates Wyatt's death. Generally, this is easy to distinguish. As for the question of Wyatt's authorship in relation to poems entered by later hands, I must observe that there are three passages of verse which are clearly entered after Wyatt's death and which are not his. On f. 7 v , Grimald entered his own adaptation of the beginning of a Wyatt poem which occurs in D, "The restful place, reviver of my smart." Following "Madame, withouten many words," on f. 24 v , a later hand has added an "Answer" ("Of few words, Sir, you seem to be") which no one has claimed for Wyatt. Finally, on f. 85 v another later hand has entered a poem known to be Surrey's, "The great Macedon," in praise of Wyatt's Penitential Psalms and preceding them. I concur with the majority view that all the other poems found between f. 4 r and f. 101 r are Wyatt's. In this context, it is important to observe that the hands responsible for copying these poems, with the exception of Wyatt's own, are secretary hands. This by itself makes E a very different manuscript from D: that manuscript is essentially an anthology compiled by different individuals acting on their own initiative, whereas in E no doubt the scribes worked as secretaries under Wyatt's instruction. The first scribe, "A," was initially instructed to copy the poems appearing on ff. 4 r -49 v ("Behold, Love, thy power how she despiseth" to the end of "Mine own John Poyntz, since ye delight to know"). Wyatt himself then copied two poems in his own hand on f. 50 r , "Desire, alas, my master and my foe" and "Venomous thorns that are so sharp and keen." Hand "A" then went on to copy ff. 50 v -54 r , "My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin"—"Unstable dream, according to the place." Wyatt then wrote two poems on f. 54 v : "In doubtful breast, whilst motherly pity" and "Of Carthage he, that worthy warrior." Hand "A" copied further poems on ff. 55 r -62 r ("Process of time worketh such wonder"—the end of "Lo what it is to love"). A new secretary hand, much less fine than that of "A," then took over. I shall call Wyatt's hand "W," and this one "B." "B" is responsible for the poetic material occurring on ff. 62 r -63 v ("I lead a life unpleasant, nothing glad"—stanza four of "Most wretched heart, most miserable"). Another secretary hand ("C") took over from "B" on f. 64 r , starting with stanza five of "Most wretched heart," and finishing on f. 66 v with "If waker care, if sudden pale colour," although interrupted by "W," who entered "From these high hills as when a spring doth fall" and "Prove whether I do change, my dear" on f. 66 r . "W" resumed on f. 67 r with "So feeble is the thread that doth the burden stay" and (for the time being) finished on f. 70 r with the fragment "From thought to thought, from hill to hill love doth me lead." After a long interval, "W" then starts the Penitential Psalms on f. 86 r , finishing that section on f. 98 v . "W" then concluded the volume with the incomplete "When Dido feasted first the wandering Trojan knight" (ff. 100 r -101 r ). The most striking fact about the general distribution of these hands is something which has not been commented upon, viz. that hand "A" is the dominant one at the beginning, and Wyatt's at the end. If we take into account that hands "A," "B," and "C" are all secretary hands, we may surely venture to guess that Wyatt originally intended E to be a fair album of his poems and never abandoned his intention that it would contain only his poems. At first, he clearly planned for "A" to be the copyist of his poems—a fact obvious from "A" entering many poems uninterruptedly on ff. 4 r -49 v , and continuing work as a copyist even after Wyatt started entering poems himself on f. 50 r . It is not clear why Wyatt increasingly took over from "A" and the other scribes, but it seems that circumstances may have interfered with what at the outset had been conceived to be the task of "A." The first two poems entered by Wyatt, on f. 50 r , give no clue, but the next two, on f. 54 v , perhaps do. The first of the two poems here, "In doubtful breast, whilst motherly pity," is based on "Mentre ne duro petto e dispietato," which is located in MS 4117 held by the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid. The second poem, "Of Carthage he, that worthy warrior," ends with the line "At Monçon thus I restless rest in Spain." Wyatt was sent as ambassador to Spain in 1537, and wrote a letter from Barbastra, near Monçon, on 16 October. It is likely, therefore, that these two poems were written at about that time, and the journey abroad may well have prompted Wyatt to write new poems, and in general may have changed the course of E. Another important factor in this may be that Wyatt was not altogether satisfied with the work of the scribes. There is no sign that he systematically examined their work, but there are many revisions in his hand. The first poem corrected by Wyatt is "Who hath heard of such cruelty before?" on f. 29 v , copied by "A." Wyatt's corrections are not confined to work done by "A," however, for the last poem which he revised, "If waker care, if sudden pale colour," on f. 66 v , was entered by hand "C." As all the subsequent poems were written out by Wyatt himself, it seems likely that he had meanwhile corrected the poems on ff. 29 v -66 v , and had come to abandon the thought that E would be a fair album of his poems, so that he started using it as a personal notebook instead. There is general agreement that the last poems in Wyatt's hand, particularly, were composed by him directly into E—revision in these poems is particularly heavy and sometimes involves a search for rhyme-words. E is thus, I believe, a Wyatt manuscript in more than one sense. It was meant to be a fair album of the poet's work, but it ended up instead as a personal notebook in which we see the poet in the process of creating his own poems. A number of poems are accompanied by the marginal sign "Tho." Others are ascribed "Wyat." In recent decades, the tendency has been to regard both "Tho" and "Wyat" as evidence of authorship, and nothing else. Arguments to this effect were first put forward by Southall. He believed (pp. 2-3 of The Courtly Maker ) that Grimald was responsible for the "Wyat" entries, and that what he calls the "'Tho' ascriptions" were the work of a member of the Wyatt family. What is more, he thought that Wyatt himself had seen these "ascriptions" ("Wyat" and "Tho"). Southall thus asked himself: "if, as has been generally supposed, all the poems in the first 120 folios (with two exceptions) are Wyatt's, why were only some of them ascribed to him and these ascriptions tacitly authorized by him? Why were forty-nine poems (excluding those in Wyatt's hand) left anonymous? What evidence is there, other than style, to show that these were by Wyatt?" In Southall's view, poems are thus only to be accepted as Wyatt's if they are in the poet's hand, or are "ascribed" to him in a way the poet knew and approved of. Automatically, the other poems are eliminated from the canon. Southall's case was not very well answered in Kenneth Muir and Patricia Thomson, eds., Collected Poems of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1969). The argument is conducted along these lines: "Everyone would allow that the twelve Egerton poems in the poet's handwriting, and six others with corrections in his hand, are authentically his. Nearly everyone accepts Wyatt's authorship of the seventy-two poems which have 'Wyat' or 'Tho' in the margin, and it is reasonably certain that twenty-four other poems in E, not so authenticated, are his" (p. xix). Scholarly questions should not be settled by a simple appeal to what is claimed to be a majority opinion; and the editors are hardly persuasive when they merely assert—without reference to fact and without demonstration —that poems which are not "authenticated" must nevertheless be Wyatt's. When I prepared my edition, I was more sympathetic, in some respects, to Southall's position, saying that if the "Tho" ascriptions (as I thought they were) "are to be trusted, the authorial status of the remaining poems is somewhat ambiguous" (p. xxii). The reservation which I had against accepting E as a collection of Wyatt poems may be expressed like this: if the person entering the "Tho" signs knew which poems were Wyatt's, surely all the poems in the manuscript, if they were Wyatt's, would be so ascribed, and if they are not we must presumably conclude that the poems left unascribed were not his. (I add that at that stage I was uncertain whether "Tho" signs had been added to the poems by a member of the Wyatt family, as Southall supposed, or by the poet himself.) There is an answer to this kind of reasoning provided by Richard Harrier, whose The Canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt's Poetry (1975) appeared at almost the same time as my edition, and whose work was quite independent. Harrier argues that "Tho" is "Wyatt's own signature, and not a sign of authorship but of approval for work done by the scribe" (p. 11). That assumption was challenged, however, by Wyatt's most recent editor, Ronald Rebholz, in Sir Thomas Wyatt: The Complete Poems (1978). 6 Rebholz comments that "a comparison of the hand responsible for the additions of 'Tho' in the margin with the 'Th' in Wyatt's book hand on, for example, folios 87 and 90, leaves me unconvinced that 'Tho' is Wyatt's signature" (p. 16). Folios 87 and 90, however, provide no proper basis for judgment. They offer poetic material (part of the Penitential Psalms, written out in Wyatt's hand); but "Th" is not the same as "Tho" and the sign "Tho" should be considered in its proper context, that is, when used in a signature at the end of letters. An excellent example of "Tho" which is fully comparable with, and identical to, many of the "Tho" signs in E, can be found at the end of one of Wyatt's letters produced in facsimile facing page 135 of volume 1 of A. K. Foxwell's edition The Poems of Sir Thomas Wiat (2 vols., 1913). 7 I know from private communications that Professor Southall, too, has come to the conclusion that the "Tho" signs are in Wyatt's hand, and both of us agree with Harrier on this matter. But, while Rebholz does not believe, or at least is not convinced, that Wyatt was responsible for the "Tho" signs, he does attach importance to them as evidence of Wyatt's authorship. Indeed, he is strongly inclined to think that poems in E which are not there attributed to Wyatt are not his: ". . . presence in a manuscript containing so many poems attributed to Wyatt but absence of attribution of the poem anywhere combine, in my view, to suggest that he probably did not write the poem . . ." (p. 16). Rebholz also pointed out that "Venomous thorns that are so sharp and keen," for example, is accompanied by marginal "Tho" but is in Wyatt's hand, and that therefore, pace Harrier, in an instance like this the sign cannot be an approval of work done by a scribe. Yet I think that Harrier's assertion, unproven though it is, and seemingly belied by "Tho" signs accompanying poems in Wyatt's hand, deserves more careful consideration, or at least may point in the right direction. Literally, of course, Rebholz is right in thinking that "Tho" cannot be a sign of approval of scribal work if a poem which it accompanies is in Wyatt's hand. But in a somewhat larger sense, Harrier may still have a point. Wyatt may well have meant to indicate something like this: "Of all the poems in this manuscript, these, including the ones in my own hand, are now in principle ready for copying into yet another manuscript." I do not mean that he considered the "Tho" poems as necessarily perfect, but I do think that he was sufficiently satisfied with them to wish to see them copied again. As I pointed out before, I believe that E had originally been intended to be a fair copy of Wyatt's foul papers. When the original intention failed, and after considerable revision of a number of poems in E, Wyatt decided that a fresh copy should be made of the poems which he marked "Tho." "Tho" was thus a sign to a scribe (we do not know which one) to the effect of "these you may proceed to copy elsewhere." It will be clear that I do not consider it likely that "Tho" was inserted in the manuscript by Wyatt to indicate that he was the author of the "Tho" poems but no others. For one thing, such an indication, by the author himself, would be highly unusual at the time. As Tottel appropriately pointed out in his preface to the first edition of the miscellany, such verse as Wyatt's and Surrey's had been denied to the public by "the ungentle hoarders up of such treasure." The hoarders are not necessarily the poets themselves, but it is obvious that it had not been the inclination of poets like Wyatt to publish their verses. Therefore, it would have been in all probability an anachronism for Wyatt to add "Tho" to his poems with the intention of saying to posterity: "these, and no others in this manuscript, are mine." The whole direction of my argument so far, with respect to the nature and make-up of E in general, has been that E is a Wyatt manuscript. I believe that this is indicated by such things as the following: the fact that the volume was no doubt already bound when Wyatt started using it; the likelihood that the fact that in addition to Wyatt's hand we only find those of secretaries implies that those secretaries worked under his instruction, so that E is not an anthology of poems by various poets; the fact that the manuscript increasingly became Wyatt's own notebook; the presence of many corrections by Wyatt. But, despite these factors (which I find cumulatively compelling), it perhaps still remains just possible that "Tho" was used to say: "these poems are mine, Wyatt's, as distinct from the others which are not." Therefore, I shall survey some of the other reasons for believing that E was designed to be a manuscript containing Wyatt's poems, not those of other poets. In what follows, I refer to the poems as they occur in Harrier's book. 8 We are lucky enough to have a number of poems which are—exceptionally for a sixteenth-century poet—in Wyatt's hand: 76, 77, 82, 83, 101, 102, 104-108, 110-123. Several of these, particulary towards the end, are full of revisions by the poet. It is a logical assumption, not only that these poems are Wyatt's, but that revisions became a more prominent feature as the thought of producing a fine copy of foul papers was abandoned; at first, particularly, Wyatt may well have copied from his own foul papers. But, although poem 77, which is very neat, may well lend support to this idea, poem 76, the first poem entered by Wyatt, was substantially revised by him. It is thus possible—although not certain—that he composed all of the poems in his own hand directly into E. At any rate, there is no reason for doubting his authorship. Several poems which are not otherwise in Wyatt's hand were corrected by him: 42, 44, 45, 46, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, perhaps 84, 86, 88, 90-93, 100, 103. Wyatt's changes are intelligent and intelligible, as well as quite consistent with his overall poetic practice in these poems, 9 and I see no reason for believing that he was correcting someone else's work. Many of the poems corrected by Wyatt are also marked "Tho," but there is no complete correlation. I do not think that Wyatt considered it necessary to indicate that the changes were his, as distinct from someone else's, or that his alterations were confined to his own poems. Presumably no such differentiation was necessary as all the poems in question were his anyway, so that no misunderstanding could arise. It is true that Grimald, too, tampered with some of the poems, but his revisions were of quite a different nature, and, being much later, can be seen as "editorial." The following are marked "Tho": 1, 10, 13, 16, 19, 23, 27, 33-39, 42, 44-54, 57-61, 63-70, 72-74, 76, 77, 79, 82-84, 87-93, 95, 97, 98, 101, 103. As I said before, "Tho" is not primarily meant to be a sign of authorship, but we may take it that an effect of its presence is that it confirms to us, in a later age, that a poem is Wyatt's. By contrast with "Tho," "Wyat" was no doubt meant to be an attribution of authorship, and can thus be properly viewed as an ascription. However, pace Southall, "Wyat" was not entered by Grimald, nor were the signs seen, leave alone "tacitly authorized," by the poet. As Harrier says (p. 12), the "Wyat" signs were inserted by the person who provided the "Answer" to Wyatt's "Madame, withouten many words" (poem 34). The nature of the hand leads me to believe that both the poem and the "Wyat" signs were added to E well after Wyatt's death. I suggest that the person responsible had independent knowledge of Wyatt's poetry enabling him, or her (the writer of the "Answer" may well have been a woman), to assign poems to Wyatt with confidence. Probably the person did not know that all the Wyatt poems were his, or else "Wyat" would have been added wherever "Tho" does not occur; but this is not the case. Presumably the person did know that the poems marked "Tho" were Wyatt's, as no "Wyat" signs were added to poems already marked "Tho." These attributions, then, seem entirely reliable within the limits of the writer's knowledge, and were no doubt based on considerable familiarity with Wyatt and his work. The "Wyat" ascriptions accompany 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-22, 24-26, 28-32, 55, and 56. Some of the poems are ascribed to Wyatt in sixteenth-century manuscripts. The most important of these is Devonshire, which attributes the following E poems to Wyatt: 39, 45, 46, 51, 52, 56, 59, 66, 73. Harleian MS 78 (British Library) ascribes to Wyatt poems 59, 68, 77, and 109. Someone has signed poem 101 "W" in the so-called Blage MS (Trinity College, Dublin). It must be admitted that these manuscript attributions have not yet been studied adequately, but no reasons have been advanced why, in any general way, we should distrust them. Most likely Wyatt's (near-)contemporaries genuinely wished to distinguish between his poems and the work of other poets; there is no evidence that early readers had any particular desire to claim for Wyatt poems which were not his. It also seems probable that they knew which poems he had written and which he had not, and unless we can find evidence to the contrary we cannot ignore this early testimony. Similar considerations must hold good for attributions in printed books. Of these, the ones which are early and which matter are the first edition of the Penitential Psalms (110-123 in Harrier), which was printed, with Wyatt's name on the title-page, in 1549, and Richard Tottel's Songes and Sonettes (1557). 10 In Tottel's miscellany, considerable care was obviously taken to include poems known to be Wyatt's and Surrey's and to keep these apart from Grimald's and, even more significantly, from the contributions by a number of "Uncertain authors." So punctilious an attitude was adopted to the question of authorship that in the second edition (July 1557) a poem which in the first edition (June) had been printed as Wyatt's was transferred to the section of anonymous poems. Tottel's book thus provides important further evidence of Wyatt's authorship. Not all of the E poems occur in Tottel; also, Tottel includes as Wyatt's a number of poems which are not found in E, but which either are unique to Tottel or else can be found in other authoritative sixteenth century sources as well. However, the overlap between E and Tottel is considerable, and the following E poems are printed, and attributed to Wyatt, in Tottel's anthology: 1-4, 8-14, 16, 20-26, 28-34, 37, 42, 44, 46-50, 52-54, 56, 59-61, 64-66, 68, 75-78, 81-83, 86, 96, 98, 101, 103-107, 109, 124. In their massiveness, these facts surely establish Wyatt as the author of the poems in E. If all these facts are to be relied upon, hardly any of the poems in E remain unaccounted for: they are either in Wyatt's hand, or corrected by him, or (if for the moment we regard "Tho" as an "ascription") are attributed to Wyatt either in E or in other (good and early) sixteenth-century sources. 11 More importantly, if the facts are presented in this way, it becomes very difficult to maintain that "Tho" is merely to be interpreted as a sign of authorship according to which all poems not marked "Tho" would have to be excluded. Admittedly, those who see "Tho" in such terms usually would also accept as Wyatt's the poems in Wyatt's hand or corrected by him, as well as the ones marked "Wyat." But there are difficulties even about this position. For example, if the "Tho" signs were inserted by Wyatt himself, and the "Wyat" ascriptions by someone else after his death, the latter category would be without value if "Tho" is to be seen as a mark of authorship, for all the poems not signed "Tho" by the poet himself would not be Wyatt's, including all of the "Wyat" poems, as the "Wyat" signs nowhere overlap with the "Tho" ones. Furthermore, if "Tho" was a sign of authorship and not intended to be something else, why did Wyatt append it to some of his poems, and not to others? Of the poems in Wyatt's hand, 76, 77, 82, 83 and 101 do have "Tho," but 102, 104-108, and 110-124 are "unsigned." But no one who has seriously studied the Penitential Psalms (110-123) in E doubts that those poems are Wyatt's. They are not only in the poet's hand, but heavily revised by him; his search for rhyme-words, obvious in the manuscript when we consider what he first wrote and subsequently preferred, shows that he composed the Psalms directly into E. Additional confirmation that they are his is provided by the 1549 edition which prints his name on the title-page. There must, therefore, be other reasons why "Tho" accompanies some of the poems in Wyatt's hand and not others. We are forced to conclude that, although accidentally the presence of "Tho" indicates Wyatt's authorship, its absence does not establish that a poem is not Wyatt's. Why, then, did Wyatt mark some of the poems which he entered with the sign "Tho" while he left others without it? It is important to realize that the distribution of the marks is not arbitrary. The group of poems marked "Tho" precedes the other one. The very first two of the "Tho" poems in Wyatt's hand, "Desire, alas, my master and my foe" (76) and "Venomous thorns that are so sharp and keen" (77), are also the first of any of the poems in his hand. They are short, and, as they stand in E, I cannot find fault with them. Wyatt probably found them satisfactory enough to "approve" them for further copying by adding "Tho." Poems 82, "In doubtful breast, whilst motherly pity," and 83, "Of Carthage he, that worthy warrior," were probably judged similarly by Wyatt, and they do indeed seem completed poems in E. The same reasoning applies to "From these high hills as when a spring doth fall" (101). We must note that all of these poems are short, as well as, it seems, in all senses complete. Are the poems not marked "Tho" either long or somehow incomplete or both? Interestingly, the next poem in Wyatt's hand, "Prove whether I do change, my dear" (102), is only four lines, but stops in the middle of the fourth line; it has to be regarded as an incomplete fragment, ending with "And if ye find . . ." It would have been very surprising if Wyatt had attached "Tho" to these lines, and I am not surprised that he has not: the poem was obviously not yet ready for further copying. The next poem in E, "If waker care, if sudden pale colour" (102), was not entered by Wyatt, but is the last to bear "Tho." After this, all the remaining poems are in his hand, 12 but not a single one is accompanied by "Tho." As we have seen, the evidence so far fits the theory that Wyatt added "Tho" to poems in his hand if he considered them satisfactorily completed, but not if he did not. All of the "Tho" poems in his hand are, moreover, short. The one short poem not marked "Tho" is a fragment. At first glance, the remaining poems seem to justify an affirmative answer to the question asked above. "So feeble is the thread that doth the burden stay" (104) is a long poem. So are, if viewed as a group, the Penitential Psalms (110-123), starting with "Love to give law unto his subject hearts," and "When Dido feasted first the wandering Trojan knight" (124), which, moreover, is incomplete—no doubt because Wyatt did not live to complete it (it is the last poem by him in E). There would appear to be a difficulty, however, about some of the other poems. Admittedly, "From thought to thought, from hill to hill love doth me lead" (108), is generally regarded as a fragment. It consists of only two lines, and, although they make sense on their own, the "poem" would be an unusually incomplete translation of a longer Petrarch poem ("Di pensier in pensier, di monte in monte"). On the other hand, "Tagus farewell, that westward with thy streams" (105) and "Of purpose Love chose first for to be blind" (106) are both short poems and, I feel, are textually perfect. Why, then, are they without "Tho"? I think that the answer must be that we are to view the last poems entered by Wyatt, from poem 104 on, as a group, for the purpose of our investigation. The last poem which he marked "Tho" was 103: after this, we find a number of poems which at least in some instances were incomplete in a way immediately obvious to us now, and which, in the case of the long poems at any rate, it would be logical for us to assume the poet may well have wished to do further work on. (The long poems in Wyatt's hand are usually those which he intensively revised in E, although the same is true of some shorter ones.) An additional reason for considering these last poems as a group is that together they conclude the manuscript as "unsigned" work after poem 103. As the last poem in E is incomplete, it is probable that Wyatt never got around to checking (and completing) poems following 103 because his sudden death prevented him from doing so. This is not to say that he would necessarily have changed every poem after 103 if he had found time, but to argue that there are good reasons why he ceased adding "Tho" to his poems after the last one which he had checked (and, indeed, corrected). I am not suggesting that all of the poems in Wyatt's hand which he failed to mark "Tho" were necessarily imperfect when he left them, nor even that he had thoroughly checked—or would eventually have found perfect—the poems to which he did attach "Tho." But I do think we find an important correlation. Whatever qualifications we must accept, it remains a fact that poems which he marked "Tho" appear to need no further revision, while the obviously imperfect ones were not provided with "Tho." This, at least, applies to poems in his own hand. Let us now consider poems which were not entered by Wyatt but corrected by him, to see whether there is any significant pattern which we can detect when we relate these to "Tho" marks. Interestingly, the poems corrected by Wyatt are all, with a very few exceptions, also marked "Tho." The following belong to both categories: 42, 44-46, 51, 53, 54, 57, 59-61, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 84 (if corrected by Wyatt), 86, 88, 90-92, 93, 100, 103. By contrast, these are poems corrected by Wyatt (not otherwise in his hand) which are not marked "Tho": 56, 86, and 100. I suggest that in the vast majority of cases Wyatt was contented enough with his corrections to indicate his approval of the poems as they stood by supplying "Tho"; but concerning three poems he must either have felt that he had yet more work to do, or he must have been forgetful. It will be of some importance to consider those three poems. It is necessary to study the poems within their context. Thus, we must be aware that poem 56 occurs amongst several poems which are both corrected by Wyatt and marked "Tho" by him. It would seem that he must have studied poems immediately before and after 56 with some care, and presumably he found this poem defective when he withheld "Tho" from it. But 56 is not the only poem without "Tho" in its immediate context: poems 54 and 57 have "Tho," but 55 is without it, and if there was a reason why Wyatt did not provide 56 with "Tho," there must also have been a reason why he did not supply it in the case of 55. In the event, it is very easy to see why Wyatt found 55 inadequate, the poem beginning "Ah, Robin." All editors have found the poem in E gravely deficient, and surely Wyatt could see what they did. A whole stanza is missing from the E version, and as each stanza is in turn spoken by "Le Plaintif" and someone providing the "Responce," the poem as it stands is quite nonsensical and incomplete. I would conjecture that Wyatt was aware of the deficiency, but did not want (or was unable) to supply the missing stanza without the manuscript from which the scribe had been copying. No. 56 was partly revised by Wyatt, but apparently not enough to seem adequate to him. It is difficult to decide what Wyatt may have disliked about the poem in its E version. However, the fact that I cannot see an obvious shortcoming in the text is no reason for supposing that there was nothing to displease Wyatt, or at least to make him decide that he might come back to the poem later. Clearly, the fact that No. 55 is so patently unsatisfactory makes it more probable that Wyatt left No. 56 intentionally without "Tho" than that he forgot to put the sign there, although the latter possibility cannot be excluded. In any case, poems 86 and 100 were almost certainly left "unsigned" deliberately, although Wyatt corrected them a little. Both poems are long ones, and a careful craftsman like Wyatt would not lightly have attached his approval to them. The text of the first ("A spending hand that alway poureth out") would to us probably not have seemed very bad when Wyatt decided against marking it "Tho," but it is demonstrably not perfect even after he corrected it. In line 37 the rhyme demands the equivalent of modern "nowadays," but the sixteenth-century scribe wrote "nowadaye se" or "nowadaye so." We should remember, moreover, that Wyatt may well have corrected obvious scribal errors but that this does not imply that he might not have revised the poem at a later stage; we know from his practice of revising poems in his own hand that at times he rejected what would to us have seemed perfectly adequate. Thus a poem copied out by a scribe may look completely acceptable to us while Wyatt may have left it "unsigned" because he intended to revise it afterwards. However, poem 100 is a very straight-forward case of a composition surviving in an incomplete and bad text, allowing even for the fact that a leaf is missing now. For example, in line 16 E's "Upright all" makes no sense whatever and needs to be emended to "Bright as." It is difficult to believe that Wyatt would have sanctioned so blatant an error, and the absence of his "Tho," combined with the fact that he did revise the poem elsewhere, no doubt indicates that he did not sanction it. But he seems to have been cautious of approving longer poems in any case: No. 78 ("My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin") is another example of a long poem which Wyatt did not ascribe "Tho." We may find ourselves somewhat surprised to discover errors in poems which Wyatt did mark "Tho." But I think we can come to terms with this if we consider the various likely factors involved. The first poem in E, "Behold, Love, thy power how she despiseth" (1), has, at the end of line 14, the surprising manuscript form "entreath." In view of the fact that, given the rhyme scheme of the poem, the word which this is meant to rhyme with is "breaketh" (line 11), one would have expected "entreateth." One must assume that Wyatt either did not bother about such minor points as he read the poem through but wished to make sure that the poem would get copied out again (not precluding the possibility of revision then), or that he overlooked some rather unimportant errors. The latter is not as unlikely as it sounds at first. This particular poem, for example, is not corrected at all, and Wyatt may have read it through rather quickly. He was not, moreover—to put it mildly—the best proofreader of his own poems, even though he was given to the habit of revising his work. In my edition I list places where the Penitential Psalms, for example, are unambiguously in need of emendation, despite Wyatt's prolonged work on these poems, composing them directly into E and extensively revising them. (Cf. 110-123 in Harrier; CVIII and p. 248 in Daalder.) When Wyatt corrected poems entered by the scribes, he at times corrected them imperfectly even when he did check them. An example is "Lo what it is to love!" (90). Wyatt did correct this, but in line 5 he left scribal "the grownd is greiff" where the Blage MS, no doubt correctly, has "growndyd." Another word which Wyatt failed to correct was MS "have" in line 28, where the syntax demands "hath." Obviously, then, Wyatt did leave mistakes here and there, but that fact cannot be used to argue that "Tho" was a sign of authorship, and that our assumption of its function is unsound. Conversely, it is interesting to consider poems not marked "Tho." As we do not know just how much time Wyatt had to look in detail at all of the poems copied out by the scribes, we should not immediately expect them all to be glaringly deficient. There is the further complicating factor that some of these poems may originally have had "Tho" but are now without it because a leaf was lost or torn: this certainly happened in some instances, and I suspect that "In eternum I was once determed" (71), half of which was lost when the leaf on which it was written suffered tearing, once had marginal "Tho" like the poems immediately before or after. On the other hand, we have also seen that there are poems so deficient that one would not expect "Tho" beside them. It is useful to assemble some of the most telling evidence here. Poem 102 is a fragment of two lines, and of course Wyatt did not add "Tho," although the poem is in his hand. No. 55, which was not marked "Tho," is seriously incomplete as a result of a scribal omission. No. 100 contains at least one very serious error. No. 32 is obviously deficient in that—as a gap in E indicates—line 4 is quite incomplete. No. 43, which occurs between two poems marked "Tho," is not incomplete, but contains an absurd error which Wyatt would not have accepted. As the version stands in E (unmodernized), the speaker wishes the lady to make some "hope appere" of "stedfastnes remedy" (line 28). Here "stedfastnes" (noun instead of adjective) is both nonsensical and unmetrical in an otherwise metrically regular poem. Thus, we readily find quite defective poems which, according to our expectation, Wyatt did not approve with "Tho." We can safely conclude, then, that "Tho" was inserted by Wyatt to indicate to a scribe that the poems so marked were in principle ready for copying into another manuscript. (We would hardly be justified in believing that the "Tho" poems were ready, or intended, to be printed.) E had been planned to be a fair album of Wyatt's poems, but when that aim was not achieved Wyatt decided that a number of poems, at least, which—often after correction—were in reasonable shape, should be copied out again. It may well be that the manuscript which was to contain the "Tho" poems was to be the kind of fair album that E had failed to become, but more likely it was merely meant to be an improvement on the increasingly untidy Egerton MS, which in the course of time had come to contain more and more corrections, and heavily revised poems in the poet's own hand. The poems which Wyatt marked "Tho" are not always perfect as they stand in E, even after correction and revision, and we need not assume that Wyatt would not again have revised the poems if they had been copied into another volume. On the other hand, as "Tho" implies approval and as the "Tho" poems are on the whole textually satisfactory, editors should obviously be very cautious about "emending" the "Tho" poems in E, and this is one important reason for being clear about the function of the "Tho" marks. Rebholz, for example, is much too eager to interfere with these (and other) poems in E. The other important reason is that we must distinguish between "ascriptions" such as the "Wyat" signs and these "Tho" marks. Scholars like Southall and Rebholz have been wrong to confuse the two categories. If viewed as a whole, E is demonstrably a Wyatt manuscript, not a miscellany like the Devonshire MS, and it was always meant to contain only Wyatt's work while the author had control over it. At first, scribes were used to provide a clean copy of the poet's foul papers, but afterwards the poet more and more concerned himself with E directly, adding poems in his own hand, revising these, and correcting scribal errors. The assumption that "Tho" indicated authorship and that therefore poems not marked "Tho" are not Wyatt's cannot be sustained as reasonable when all the relevant evidence is considered. It so happens that the "Tho" signs confirm to us that the poems are Wyatt's; however, the marks were not intended to signal that message to us, but a very different one to a sixteenth-century scribe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am indebted to Professor Southall for confirming the accuracy of these observations; he points out that the grid measurements of the paper throughout are 17 mm. between 20 laid lines and 21-24 mm. between the chain lines. 2 "Modern" is a relative term here; the watermark dates this leaf 1807, and it (with the other "modern" leaves) was no doubt inserted when E was re-bound in c. 1810. 3 Cf. Southall, p. 160, and see also, for a more detailed account on this matter, R. C. Harrier, The Canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt's Poetry (1975), p. 2. 4 The title of this poem (first line: "When Dido feasted first the wandering Trojan knight") is Wyatt's own. My practice in this paper will be to refer to poems by their first lines as they appear in my edition. The fact that the lines are modernized will facilitate finding the poems in other editions, and I also modernize—for convenience—other quotations, unless I indicate otherwise. 5 Harrier (above, note 3) is wrong in stating (p. 213) that "Vulcan begot me" is written in Wyatt's "italic holograph": no one, either before the appearance of his book or after, has supported him in this assertion. 6 This Harmondsworth: Penguin edition was reprinted by Yale UP (New Haven) in 1981. 7 Foxwell's text was reprinted by Russell (New York) in 1964. 8 The reason for this is that Harrier is the only modern scholar to print the E poems in the order of the manuscript. The numbers which follow are therefore Harrier's, though the first lines (modernized) remain those of my edition. Readers who have no access to Harrier may wish to know that numbers in Harrier's edition (arabic) correspond to those in mine (roman) as follows: 1-74=I-LXXIV; 75=CV; 76-77=LXXV-LXXVI; 78=CVI; 79-85=LXXVII-LXXXIII; 86=CVII; 87-89=LXXXIV-LXXXVI; 90-92=LXXXVII; 93-109=LXXXVIII-CIII; 110-123=CVIII; 124=CIV. 9 I discuss the nature of his revisions in my article "Rhetoric and Revision in Wyatt's Poems," AUMLA 31 (May 1969), 63-75. 10 There is a splendid modern edition by H. E. Rollins, Tottel's Miscellany ( 1557-1587 ), 2 vols. (1928-29, rev. ed. 1965). There is also an adequate facsimile of the sole surviving copy of the first edition (Bodleian Library, Oxford) by Scolar Press Ltd. (1967). 11 It would also be possible to argue for Wyatt's authorship on the basis of verse forms used (e.g. sonnets, strambotto's, etc.), although the fact that he is known to have introduced them in England does not preclude the possibility that other poets may have imitated him so successfully that we can now no longer keep his work apart. A more promising approach, I feel, is to study all the references to autobiographical events in the poems; I do this—as part of my argument—in a separate paper "Are Wyatt's Poems in Egerton MS. 2711 in Chronological Order?" which I hope to publish soon. 12 Except for "Vulcan begot me, Minerva me taught" (109) discussed before, and other material entered after Wyatt's death which scholars have not claimed for him and which is easily distinguished from his work.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Sir John Harington's Manuscripts in Italic by R. H. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thanks to P. J. Croft's intricate analysis of Harington's secretary hand, 1 it is now possible not only to affirm his identification of that hand but to show also that three italic manuscripts of works by Sir John Harington have been erroneously identified as autograph. The manuscripts in question are (1) Cambridge Adv. b. 8. 1, a text of 52 epigrams bound in with a copy of his translation of Orlando Furioso (1591) and presented to his mother-in-law, Lady Jane Rogers, dated Dec. 19, 1600; (2) Folger Library V.a.249, a relatively complete text of Harington's epigrams, dated June 19, 1605; (3) British Library Royal 17 B xxii, a presentation copy of Harington's Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops , dated February 18, 1608. These manuscripts are described in Peter Beal, Index of English Literary Manuscripts , I (1980), ii, items HrJ 21, HrJ 22, and HrJ 328, respectively, where they are also listed as autograph. 2 They also appear to be the only manuscripts of Harington's work that are predominantly in the italic hand. Although italic appears frequently in his other manuscripts, they are predominantly in secretary hand. In his work on Harington's secretary hand, Croft was able to distinguish that hand from at least two scribal hands. What is additionally significant is that what I will call the Croft secretary autograph appears exclusively in tandem with a distinctive italic quite different from that of the three manuscripts noted above, all of which appear to be in the same hand. This Croft italic hand is also consistent with Harington's italic signatures. The consistency of this hand and the Harington signature allows for further substantiation of Croft's conclusions about Harington's secretary hand and also allows us to identify the three italic manuscripts in question as being in a scribal hand. Two manuscripts in the Croft secretary provide clear examples of Harington's autograph italic. They are B.L. Add. 18920 (Beal HrJ 8), the famous autograph manuscript of the Orlando translation (c. 1590-91), where the head stanzas and marginalia are in italic, and Bodl. Rawl. B. 162 (Beal HrJ 326), Harington's autograph text of his A Short View of the State of Ireland (dated April 20, 1605), where Latin verses appear in italic embedded in the secretary hand of the text. Additional examples can be found in other Harington autograph manuscripts and in his letters. As can be seen from these examples, Harington's italic is a somewhat insecure hand, not as refined as that of a professional scribe nor as assured as his elegant secretary hand. It is characterized by some ligation between the minuscules, lines that show compression of words and letters, and heavily clubbed ascenders and curled descenders. Overall, it has a rather erect, slightly tremulous character. 3 This italic hand appearing in the Croft secretary autograph is also identical to Harington's signature, of which many examples exist. 4 An example is given below, from the manuscript of the epigrams presented to Lady Rogers, one of the italic manuscripts in question here: only the date and signature in this specimen are autograph. The signature shows the distinctive tremor, the erect quality of the letters. Especially noticeable is the minuscule t , which is narrow and tall, as it is also in the Croft specimens. The example shows clearly the contrast between the scribal italic of the text of the letter and Harington's date and signature, which is discussed in more detail below. A comparison of the above italic examples from the Croft secretary autograph and those from the three italic manuscripts shows the same difference between the two hands as is found in the letter to Lady Rogers. Limitations of space prevent reproduction of more than a sampling of specimens from these manuscripts, but those who consult them will find numerous examples that bear out my identification. Harington's clubbed ascenders and curled descenders contrast with the broadly stroked ones of the italic manuscripts. Harington's italic shows again more verticality in the angle of the script and a narrower width to minuscules, particularly in the n and m , and the taller t. Capitals also are less elegantly shaped in Harington's autograph. The three italic manuscripts in question also contain, to a greater or lesser degree, Harington's autograph corrections in italic, which can be identified with ease, and which provide vivid contrasts between the scribal hand and Harington's. 5 Only a few examples occur in Cambr. Adv. b. 8. 1 and Fo. V.a.249, but Harington's hand is readily identifiable. Only the title here is in autograph. Contrast can be seen most clearly in the forms of the d, f , and t . The phrase "from Bathe" in line 4 of the title is autograph. This same alteration also appears in the poem as it is given in Fo. V.a.249, p. 45. The corrections in B.L. Royal 17 B xxii are more frequent and provide more contrast between the firm scribal italic and Harington's deteriorating italic as it appeared in late 1607-early 1608, when he had already begun to suffer from ill health, four years before his death. 6 The tremulous lighter stroke, the more erect script, the taller t , are all quite evident. The scribe apparently left lacunae throughout the text for Harington to fill, usually for a quote or a name. Some were filled, others not. After the word "Seneca" Harington's script begins, "agaynst Iuvenile consilium privatum &lt;odium&gt; comodum inuesta odium." In the last line the interpolated word "parcial" can be distinguished as autograph. This is only one of many examples of Harington's overlay of the scribal text with his own revisions throughout the manuscript. Hardly a page is bare of some small notation in his hand. The question naturally occurs, If this is not Harington's italic, then whose is it? The regular hand appears to be that of Croft's scribe A, which can be seen in both its secretary and italic forms in sections of B.L. Add. 46370 (Beal HrJ 32), a copy also of the Catalogue of Bishops , where it is embedded in scribe A's secretary hand. Examples of scribe A's secretary hand are given in Croft, "Harington's Manuscript," Plates 4 and 6, but they show very little of his italic. Here one can see in the italic passages the firm scribal hand, characterized by a calligraphic, broad stroke to the letters, especially in the ascenders and descenders, that is identical to that of the three italic manuscripts in question here. This new identification of the italic handwriting for the Harington texts allows us to understand better the nature and role of these manuscripts in the development of the texts of the epigrams and of the Catalogue of Bishops , though the implications of it are not major so far as these texts are concerned. The two italic manuscripts of the epigrams, Cambr. Adv. b. 8. 1 and Fo. V.a. 249, appear to be intermediate in the developing text of those poems, as B.L. Add. 12049 (Beal HrJ 20), an earlier manuscript than either of these, contains autograph revisions that postdate either Cambr. Adv. b. 8. 1 or Fo. V.a.249 and thus represents a later state of the text. So far as is known, B.L. Royal 17 B xxii remains Harington's final, but not autograph, version of his Catalogue of Bishops as he wanted it preserved and as he oversaw its preparation for presentation to Prince Henry. However, the identification of Harington's italic hand through his signature and its exclusive presence within the Croft secretary autograph further confirms Croft's identification of that hand and clears up the confusion in the earlier discussions of the Harington manuscripts by Greg and also by Ruth Hughey. 7</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Final Quires of the Jonson 1616 Workes : Headline Evidence by Kevin J. Donovan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonson's 1616 Workes , a folio-in-sixes collating ¶ 6 A-4P 6 4Q 4 , is a bibliographically complex book, and nowhere more so than in the final quires, 4F-4Q, which contain the text of the masques. Here we find frequent headline dislocations and, in 4M-4Q, extensive resetting, as well as the reimposition of a number of unreset pages. 1 In quires 4M-4Q and quire ¶, which was printed last, it is sometimes difficult to establish the sequence of some of the printing variants. However, evidence from headline rules found in the Workes and in another book helps to resolve most of this difficulty. Two skeletons that first appear in quire 4P of the Jonson volume come from another folio-in-sixes produced by Stansby in 1616, The Surueyor in Foure Bookes by Aaron Rathborne (STC 20748), collating A-V 6 X 4 . The headline rules show when these skeletons left the Rathborne volume for use in the Jonson Folio, and when they returned to The Surveyor , but changed in ways ascribable to their use in the Workes . The condition of the rules in The Surveyor helps to establish the temporal sequence of variant impressions in the last quires of the Workes . Besides settling the problem of the order of variants, the evidence from the headline rules shared by the Workes and The Surveyor enables us to recognize an instance of printing-house negligence in quire 4P. What appears to be an obvious press-correction in the text of Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists , on 4P5 v , can now be identified as the introduction of a gross error by the printers; the correct state is the earlier one. In addition, a dated preface in the Rathborne book provides a later date for Jonson's Workes than has yet been proposed. The basis of this study is an examination of eight copies of the Jonson Folio at the Folger Shakespeare Library (including two large-paper copies), two at the Library of Congress, six copies at Harvard's Houghton Library, one complete and one incomplete copy at the Boston Public Library, one at the Newberry Library, the Scolar Press facsimile of a copy at the Bodleian Library, microfilm reproductions of two copies (one on large paper) at the British Library, and a microprint of a copy at the New York Public Library. The copy of Rathborne's Surveyor referred to is that in the Rare Book Room of the University of Wisconsin's Memorial Library, which I have checked against a microfilm copy. 2 The extensive resetting in quires 4M to 4O of the Workes is documented by Simpson in the Oxford Ben Jonson (HS, IX, 30-40). The text is wholly reset in all the pages of quire 4M except 4M2 r and the bottom half of 4M2 v ; and in formes 4N3 r .4 v , 4N1 v .6 r , 4O3 v .4 r , and 4O3 r .4 v . In addition to this resetting, as Gerritsen recognized, "with two exceptions [4P3 v .4 r and 4P1 v .6 r ], all those formes of 4M-4P which were not reset were reimposed." 3 That is, all of these formes are found to have been printed twice, each time with a different skeleton. We may add to this list 4Q1 r .[4 v ] and ¶3 v .4 r , which were also twice impressed. 4 What seems to have happened is that a mistake was made in counting the number of sheets required for printing these formes, which were then printed short. Apparently the counting error was discovered about the time that quire 4P was being printed, since there are two invariant formes in this quire. Then "all the undistributed type of these quires was collected, the missing portions were reset, and further copies printed to make up the numbers" (Gerritsen, 1959, p. 55). The resetting did not involve correction of the text, and some trivial errors were introduced. In the unreset but reimposed pages only three variants appear in sheets between impressions; two of these are trivial and the third is the miscorrection of 4P5 v mentioned above which, as we shall see, was probably caused by a disturbance of the standing type. This theory would require that at the time of resetting and reimposition Stansby had a good deal of type standing—"37 folio pages" in Dr. Gerritsen's estimate (1959, p. 55). That Stansby had a large amount of type at his disposal is indicated in other ways. The headlines in the Workes reveal a large number of skeletons in use. In contrast to the Shakespeare Folio of 1623, printed with never more than two skeletons, and to the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, whose various sections were printed with only one or two skeletons at a time, four to six skeletons at a time were normally employed in the Jonson Folio. 5 This difference is not due to the different style of page layout used in the Jonson Workes . The Stansby/Jonson Folio, using english-size type stretching the width of the page rather than pica crowded into double columns, required fewer types per page than did these two other folio collections; however, Stansby nonetheless seems to have had much more type at his disposal than did Jaggard. Although the circumstances involved in the final quires are exceptional, my examination of recurrent types in Every Man Out of His Humour , where printing began, found that Stansby usually had an entire quire of type—twelve folio pages—left standing at a time. As we shall see, the large-paper copies of the Workes always contain the original impressions of all the reset and reimposed sheets in quires 4M-4P, and possibly in quires 4Q and ¶ although the evidence is less conclusive there. 6 While some small-paper copies are confined to the later impressions, others have some sheets of the earlier printing bound up with reimposed sheets. Evidently the large-paper copies were run first during the printing of the final quires; then Stansby began the small-paper copies, where the counting error occurred. Most pages in the Workes have headlines consisting of double-pica italic running titles and page numbers enclosed between two horizontal rules, although sometimes the rules alone appear, when the headlines have been removed for specific reasons, such as the presence of a head title on the page. The individual types of the running titles, especially those with kerns, are often battered or bent in distinctive ways that allow them to be readily identified. In most of the book, the orderly alternation of running titles paired as forme-mates shows clearly that the headlines were treated as an integral part of the skeleton. The rules, too, are usually distinctively bent or nicked, and regularly recur with the same headlines. Some pairs of headline rules continue relatively unchanged for long periods in the volume. In the later quires of the Workes , the rules become the primary means of skeleton identification, because of the frequent dislocation of the running titles. In quires 4F-4Q the running titles on both the recto and verso pages read " Masques ", although thirteen different "works" are included in this section. When a new masque began a page and was introduced by a head title, Stansby's men usually removed the headline, leaving only the headline rules. When this occurred in quires 4K-4N, several running titles moved from one skeleton to another. However, the rules continued to recur regularly in the same positions; thus we can still identify the skeletons used in this section as the same four that are found throughout quires 4F-4O, reset pages excepted. Even though the positions of the running titles change several times, we can recognize on the basis of the headline rules that the original impressions of quires 4F-4O are printed with the same four skeletons found in the last quires of the preceding section, Entertaynments . (In quire 4P two new skeletons appear.) The headline configurations found in quires 4F-4K are identified in the chart below. First, however, a word of explanation is necessary. The succeeding charts describe the configurations of the running titles and headline rules, which are the usual basis for skeleton identification. For convenience I have labelled each configuration of paired headline elements as a "skeleton," although strictly speaking only four skeleton formes were used in the original impressions of quires 4F-4O. The headline configurations are labelled with an arabic numeral and a capital letter. The former refers to the rules which, except for the change in quire 4G, remain constant; however, since the running titles change position so frequently, I assign a letter to the skeletons that changes with the successive changes in the headlines. Skeleton 1A: Running title I: 4F4 r , 4F2 r , 4G4 r , 4G5 r , 4H1 r , 4I5 r , 4I1 r , 4K3 r , 4K1 r Running title VIII: 4F3 v , 4F5 v , 4G3 v , 4G2 v , 4H6 v , 4I2 v , 4I6 v , 4K4 v , 4K6 v Skeleton 2A: Running title IIa: 4F6 v , 4G4 v , 4G6 v ; Running title IIb: 4H2 v , 4H1 v , 4I4 v , 4K1 v , 4K2 v Running title VII: 4G3 r , 4G1 r , 4H5 r , 4H6 r , 4I3 r , 4K6 r , 4K5 r Skeleton 3A: Running title VI: 4F4 v Running title V: 4F3 r , 4F6 r Skeleton 4A: Running title III: 4F2 v , 4G1 v Running title IV: 4F5 r , 4G6 r During the printing of quire 4G, the headline elements of Skeletons 3A and 4A were recombined; the recto headline of Skeleton 3A ( i.e. , Running title V) was combined with the verso headline ( i.e. , Running title III) of Skeleton 4A to form 'Skeleton 3B'. The verso headline ( i.e. , Running title VI) of Skeleton 3A was combined with a new running title (Running title IX) within the recto headline rules of Skeleton 4 to form 'Skeleton 4B'. The reconstituted skeletons appear on the following pages: Skeleton 3B: Running title III: 4G5 v , 4H4 v , 4H5 v , 4I5 v , 4I1 v , 4K5 v Running title V: 4G2 r , 4H3 r , 4H2 r , 4I2 r , 4I6 r , 4K2 r Skeleton 4B: Running title VI: 4H3 v , 4I3 v , 4K3 v Running title IX: 4H4 r , 4I4 r , 4K4 r After quire 4G there were no further complications until quire 4K. In quires 4K and 4L and in the original impression of quires 4M and 4N, running titles were again shifted from one skeleton to another. These dislocations were caused by the removal of the running titles from pages that begin with head titles. Thus the following headline changes occurred in quires 4K and 4L. After forme 4K1 v .6 r was printed, with Skeleton 2A intact, forme 4K2 v .5 r was printed with the same skeleton; however, Running title VII was removed from between the recto rules of Skeleton 2A because 4K5 r contains the head title for The Masque of Queenes . (4K5 r was printed with no headline but with the recto headline rules of Skeleton 2A intact.) The removal of Running title VII led to a number of consequent changes in the headlines of quire 4L. When Skeleton 2 next appears, in formes 4L2 r .5 v and 4L1 v .6 r , Running title VII has been replaced by Running title I, removed from the recto headline of Skeleton 1A. The new Skeleton 2 configuration is now designated Skeleton 2B. It consists of the same headline rules as Skeleton 2A, with Running title IIb still in the verso position and Running title I now in the recto position. In addition, these same dislocations caused the changes that transformed Skeleton 1A into Skeleton 1B. We have seen that Running title I went to Skeleton 2B. Replacing Running title I in the recto headline of Skeleton 1 is Running title VI (which had been in the verso headline of Skeleton 4B as late as the printing of forme 4L3 v .4 r , printed with Skeleton 4B intact). Running title VII, removed from Skeleton 2A when forme 4K2 v .5 r was printed with a head title, next appears in the verso headline of Skeleton 1, displacing Running title VIII. Skeleton 4B is in turn changed into the configuration I have called Skeleton 4C. Running title VIII, displaced from the verso headline of Skeleton 1A, reappears in the verso headline of Skeleton 4, which was left vacant by the relocation of Running title VI to Skeleton 2B cited above. The recto headline of Skeleton 4 remains unaffected by these changes; Skeleton 3B, too, is unchanged. The headlines remained this way until another, similar dislocation occurred in quires 4M and 4N. Thus the skeletons from quire 4L into 4N are identified and designated as follows: Skeleton 1B (same rules as Skeleton 1A): Running title VI (replacing I): 4L3 r , 4L5 r , 4M5 r , 4N5 r Running title VII (replacing VIII): 4L4 v , 4L2 v , 4M2 v , 4N2 v Skeleton 2B (same rules as Skeleton 2A): Running title I (replacing VII): 4L2 r , 4L6 r Running title IIb: 4L5 v , 4L1 v , 4N5 v Skeleton 4C: Running title VIII (replacing VI): 4L6 v , 4M3 v , 4M1 v , 4N4 v Running title IX: 4L1 r , 4M4 r , 4M6 r , 4N3 r Skeleton 3B (unchanged): Running title III: 4M5 v , 4M6 v , 4M4 v Running title V: 4M2 r , 4M1 r In the original impressions of quires 4M and 4N, the three pages 4M3 r , 4N2 r , and 4N6 v contain no running titles because they contain head titles. The removal of the headlines on 4M3 r and 4N2 r brought about changes which transformed Skeleton 3B into Skeleton 3C; this occurred in the following way. After formes 4M1 r .6 v and 4M2 r .5 v were printed with Skeleton 3B intact, 4M3 r .4 v was printed without a recto running title, because 4M3 r begins with the head title to Prince Henry's Barriers . When Skeleton 3 next appeared, in quire 4N (formes 4N3 v .4 r and 4N1 v .6 r ), Running title I occupied the recto headline (filling the space left empty on 4M3 r ); this is the configuration labelled Skeleton 3C. Running title I had been removed from Skeleton 2B before forme 4N2 r .5 v was printed because 4N2 r contains the head title for Oberon the Faery Prince . Thus Skeleton 2B appeared on forme 4N2 r .5 v with a complete verso headline but without a recto running title. However, when forme 4N1 r .6 v was being imposed in this skeleton, the verso running title had to be removed because 4N6 v contains the head title for Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly . Whereas the recto headline of Skeleton 2B lacked a running title and now needed one on 4N1 r , the verso running title (IIb) was transferred to the recto headline for the printing of forme 4N1 r .6 v . The skeleton now lacked a verso running title. A new one was composed, using letters from Running title V (removed from Skeleton 3B on page 4M3 r ); I have labelled it Running title X. This new configuration, "Skeleton 2C," can be seen in formes 4O3 r .4 v and 4O2 r .5 v . Skeletons 1B and 4C are unaffected by these changes. Thus the skeletons in the original impressions of formes 4N3 v .4 r , 4N1 v .6 r , and 4N1 r .6 v , and of quire 4O are as follows: Skeleton 1B (same rules as former Skeleton 1A): Running title VI: 4O4 r Running title VII: 4O3 v Skeleton 2C (same rules as former Skeletons 2A and 2B): Running title IIb: 4N1 r , 4O3 r , 4O2 r Running title X: 4O4 v , 4O5 v Skeleton 3C (same rules as former Skeleton 3B): Running title I: 4N4 r , 4N6 r , 4O5 r Running title III: 4N3 v , 4N1 v , 4O2 v Skeleton 4C (same rules as former Skeleton 4B): Running title VIII: 4O6 v , 4O1 v Running title IX: 4O1 r , 4O6 r All of the preceding discussion has concerned the original impressions only. The headlines show that the resetting in quires 4M-4O took place after the original imposition and printing of all the quires in the volume. All of the reset pages were printed with the same skeleton, which we will call "Skeleton o", whose headlines were composed of various elements taken from the headlines of Skeletons 3C and 4C. 7 Because Skeletons 3C and 4C remain intact to the end of the volume in the original impressions and are also found intact in some of the reimposed but unreset formes, Skeleton o cannot have been constructed before the miscounted sheets of the final quires were all printed and before some unreset formes were reimposed to correct the counting error. In addition to the reset formes, several of the unreset formes were reimposed in Skeleton o, specifically 4N3 v .4 r , 4N1 r .6 v , and 4N2 v .5 r . Thus these sheets were reimposed at about the same time as the reset pages, and there is no difficulty distinguishing the earlier impressions of these formes from the reimpressions. 8 The remaining unreset but reimposed formes were not reimposed with Skeleton o; thus the earlier states are not distinguished from the later ones so readily. These are 4N2 r .5 v ; both formes of sheets 4O1.6, 4O2.5, and 4P2.5; and formes 4P3 r .4 v , 4P1 r .6 v , 4Q1 r .[4 v ], and ¶3 v .4 r . Forme 4N2 r .5 v varies between some copies (including the large-paper copies) printed with Skeleton 2B and others printed with Skeleton 3C. The latter state is found in sheets perfected with Skeleton o, which, as we noted above, could not have been constructed until after the completion of the original impressions and some reimpositions. The use of Skeleton o in the perfecting forme suggests that the impression of 4N2 r .5 v in Skeleton 3C is the later one, and the impression in Skeleton 2B the original. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Skeleton 3C was used in other reimpositions (as we will see below), while Skeleton 2 is last seen intact in the original imposition of quire 4O. Finally we may note that the original state of 4N2 r .5 v , printed with Skeleton 2B but lacking a recto headline, helps to explain the progression of the headlines from the configuration of Skeleton 2B to that of 2C, as well as the change from Skeleton 3B to Skeleton 3C, as described above. Since Skeleton 3C came into being as a result of the impression of 4N2 r .5 v with Skeleton 2B, the impression of this forme with Skeleton 3C must be the later one. The reimpressed but unreset formes in quires 4O and 4P can be considered as a group; they are listed below. The large-paper states are the originals, the others the reimpressions. Forme Skeleton found in large-paper copies 9 Skeleton found in other copies 4O2 v .5 r Skeleton 3C Skeleton 1B v .6 r 4O2 r .5 v Skeleton 2C Skeleton 4C 4O1 v .6 r Skeleton 4C Skeleton 3C 4O1 r .6 v Skeleton 4C Skeleton 1B r .2C v 4P3 r .4 v Skeleton 6 Skeleton 4C 4P2 v .5 r Skeleton 5 Skeleton 1B v .6 r 4P2 r .5 v Skeleton 6 Skeleton 1B r .2C v 4P1 r .6 v Skeleton 1B Skeleton 1B v .6 r A few words of explanation are in order. The skeletons in the right hand column above labelled 1 B r .2C v and 1B v .6 r are so designated to describe their composite character. Skeleton 1B r .2C v is a combination of the recto headline and rules of Skeleton 1B (now placed in the verso position) with the verso headline and rules of Skeleton 2C (now placed in the recto position). Skeleton 1B v .6 r is composed of the verso headline 10 of Skeleton 1B paired with the recto headline rules and verso running title of Skeleton 6 as seen in the large-paper copies of 4P3 r .4 v and 4P2 r .5 v . The hybrid character of Skeletons 1B v .6 r and 1B r .2C v is itself an indication that the formes printed with them are reimpressions, not originals. Skeleton 1B, which was split apart to create these two hybrid skeletons, is found intact in the large-paper copies of formes 4P1 r .6 v , and in all copies of 4Q2 v .3 r and ¶3 v .4 r . This suggests that the reimpression of the variant sheets in quires 4O and 4P took place after the original imposition of all of the final quires; at any rate there can be little doubt that Skeletons 1B v .6 r and 1B r .2C v are found on reimposed sheets, and that Skeletons 1B, 2C and 6, when found intact, precede them. The second salient feature in the list above is the appearance of two new skeletons in the printing of the original copies. Skeletons 5 and 6 first appear in the large-paper copies of quire 4P; Skeleton 5 can be seen in all copies of the Workes on 4P3 v .4 r , an invariant forme. Both the rules and the running titles of these two skeletons are wholly new to the Jonson volume. Fortunately, the rules are quite distinctive: they are the same as those found in quires N-R of The Surveyor . The rules of Skeleton 6 are particularly recognizable. Here are the verso headlines as seen on R3 v of The Surveyor : The headline rules of Skeleton 5 are less striking, but can also be readily identified. Skeletons 5 and 6 can be traced back to the early quires of the Rathborne book, although they are at first hardly recognizable as the same rules. 11 Gradually, through wear and through changes in the positions of the rules, they assume the configurations seen in the Jonson Folio. Quires N-R of The Surveyor are printed with Skeletons 5 and 6 alone. In quire R the headline rules look virtually the same as those in certain copies of the Workes , quire 4P. In quire S of The Surveyor to its end, however, not only do these rules enclose running titles in different types, but the position of the rules changes and the two pairs of headline rules in Skeleton 6 are now separated and appear in two different skeletons. This separation of the two sets of headline rules from Skeleton 6 is explained by the composition of Skeleton 1B v .6 r in the Workes . The recto headline was separated from its forme-mate and paired with the verso headline from Skeleton 1B. This fact indicates that Skeletons 5 and 6 were transferred to the Workes between the printing of quires R and S of The Surveyor . Further evidence that the final quires of the Workes were printed between quires R and S of The Surveyor is seen in the fact that on S3 r of The Surveyor we find the recto headline rules of Skeleton 2 as they appear on 4Q4 r of the Workes , their last appearance in the book. When Skeletons 5 and 6 returned to The Surveyor from the Workes , these headline rules went with them. Recognition of the prior integrity of Skeleton 6 establishes the originality of the large-paper impressions of formes 4O2 v .5 r , 4O1 r .6 v , 4P3 r .4 v , 4P2 v .5 r , 4P2 r .5 v , and 4P1 r .6 v . There is good reason for supposing that the large-paper copies of formes 4O2 r .5 v , 4O1 v .6 r , and 4P3 r .4 v are also original impressions, as they perfect original impressions. The large-paper copies of 4O2 r .5 v , showing the last appearance of Skeleton 2C intact, had to have been printed before forme 4Q1 v .4 r , where we find the recto headline of Skeleton 2C paired with a new forme-mate in all copies. As we have noted, the reimpressions were apparently not done until after the printing of all the original and invariant formes in the final quires and preliminaries. We are now in a position to describe the original printing of quires 4O an 4P. 4O3 v .4 r was originally printed with Skeleton 1B, 4O3 r .4 v and 4O2 r .5 v with Skeleton 2C, 4O2 v .5 r with Skeleton 3C, and both formes of sheet 4O1.6 with Skeleton 4C. In quire 4P Skeletons 5 and 6 were introduced. Formes 4P3 v .4 r and 4P2 v .5 r were printed with Skeleton 5 and their perfecting formes with Skeleton 6. 4P1 v .6 r was printed with Skeleton 3C and 4P1 r .6 v with Skeleton 1B. The sequence of the variant impressions has some textual significance. On 4O6 v , line 35, the original setting gives the word "ripned"; in the later impression this reads "rip'ned." This would appear to be a straightforward case of press-correction. 12 A more interesting case is that of the variants in 4P5 v . In the large-paper copies and others, we find at lines 9-10 "a thing of nothing . . . a | toy, a lease"; the other copies give "nothing of nothing . . . a | any lease". The two states of this page are recorded by Simpson as a press-correction, which is what they would normally appear to be; they seem also to have been accepted as such by Jackson. 13 However, the headlines show that the correct state, the one printed with Skeleton 6 intact, is the earlier one, while the garbled version is the reimpression. The variants are confined to the left-hand margin of two consecutive lines. Apparently the standing type was disturbed between the two impressions, and Stansby's staff haphazardly reconstructed the gap in the text by guesswork, rather than referring to their copy. This example underscores the Oxford editors' recognition that "the text of the entertainments and masques is often carelessly printed" (a recognition that, unfortunately, weakens the authority of the Oxford edition for the texts of several masques). 14 We have been able to identify with confidence the large-paper copies of the masques' quires through 4P as the originals. Such confidence diminishes when we examine the headline evidence in 4Q and ¶. Quire 4Q is a gathering of two sheets. The text of the masques ends with the conclusion of The Golden Age Restored on 4Q4 r .4Q4 v is a blank page. A major textual variant occurs on 4Q3 v and 4Q4 r with the repositioning of two speeches. In most copies, Astraea's final speech and the " Galliards and Coranto's " (ll. 221-240 in HS) precede Pallas's final speech and the Chorus's couplet of praise to Jove (ll. 199-220); in the large-paper copies (and some small-paper copies) they are transposed as they appear in the Oxford edition. The positions of the speeches were changed without any disturbance to the surrounding text, and the headlines of these two pages and of their forme-mates are invariant. Forme 4Q2 r .3 v was printed with Skeleton 4C. 4Q1 v .4 r is anomalous, as it was printed with a new hybrid skeleton, composed of the recto headline of Skeleton 2C paired with another headline, one that appears nowhere else in the volume. We have already noted that 4Q4 r gives us the last appearance of the recto headline of Skeleton 2C in the Workes (the recto rules then go to S3 r of The Surveyor ). The verso headline of Skeleton 2C (i.e. Running title X within Skeleton 2C's verso rules) is found in the more common state of 4Q1 r —the only variant headline in quire 4Q—and in most copies of ¶6 r ; this formerly verso headline now occupies a recto position. The forme-mates of both 4Q1 r and ¶6 r are blank pages. (This configuration would seem to be preliminary to the creation of Skeleton 1B r .2C v , which pairs this headline in this position with the recto headline from Skeleton 1B, now occupying the verso position.) The large-paper copies of 4Q1 r were printed with a headline found nowhere else in the volume except for the variant copies of ¶6 r . This headline will be discussed below at greater length. Quire ¶ contains the preliminaries to the Workes , and the headlines have no running titles, but rules and page numbers. The first leaf of this quire is a blank. ¶2 r contains the title page to the Workes and ¶2 v is a blank page. Thus only ¶3 r -¶6 v have headlines. ¶[2 v ].5 r bears the recto headline rules from Skeleton 3C, and ¶[2 r ].5 v the verso headline rules from Skeleton 4C. Besides ¶[1 v ].6 r , only one other forme, ¶3 r .4 v , was reimposed. The large-paper copies etc. were printed with Skeleton 4C, the others with Skeleton 1B r .2C v . The large-paper copies would seem to be the originals, as ¶3 v .4 r shows Skeleton 1B still intact in all copies. Three wholly new headlines appear in quires 4Q and ¶. One of these occurs in all copies of ¶6 v , whose forme-mate is a blank page; the only other place in the volume where these rules appear is the headline of 3S2 v , an anomalous headline over the text of Catiline , whose forme-mate, 3S5 r , the title-page of the Epigrammes , lacks a headline; Dr. Gerritsen believes that "forgetfulness in printing . . . or perhaps a reluctance to decide on its form [i.e. the typography of the title-page to Epigrammes ], deferred the printing of [3S2 v .5 r ] till the end of the volume." 15 Another new headline appears in all copies of 4Q1 v , paired with the recto headline of Skeleton 2C as a forme-mate (on 4Q4 r ). This is the only appearance of this headline in the Workes . The third new headline is particularly intriguing. It is found in the large-paper copies of 4Q1 r and a few variant copies of ¶6 r . In both of its appearances it has no verso forme-mate; thus it displays a distinct skeleton configuration and can be labelled "Skeleton 7". In both of its appearances Skeleton 7 is related to textual variants. Although there are no variants on 4Q1 r , 4Q1 r .[4 v ] perfects 4Q1 v .4 r , where a major variant, the change in the ending to The Golden Age Restored , occurs. The so-called revised ending is always found in copies (including all the large-paper copies) that show Skeleton 7 on 4Q1 r .[4 v ]; Skeleton 7 appears only in copies with the "revised" ending. The other appearance of Skeleton 7 is even more remarkable in that it is directly related to a textual change and in the fact that it presents the only variation among large-paper copies that I have seen in these later quires. On some copies of ¶6 r , including some though not all of the large-paper copies, side-notes are added to the commendatory verses found on this page. The copies containing the side-notes were imposed with Skeleton 7, the others, including some large-paper copies, were imposed with the verso headline of Skeleton 2C in the recto position, i.e. with the recto headline of Skeleton 1B r .2C v , perhaps before it was paired with the recto headline from Skeleton 1B. The introduction of the side-notes indicates that some of the large-paper copies of this sheet were printed after most of the copies. It is only logical to suppose that the side-notes on the verses were added late rather than deleted early during the printing of forme ¶[1 v ].6 r . There is no good reason for deleting them, whereas their addition serves a good purpose; "Without them it would not be clear that Donne's verses referred to Volpone " (HS IX, 52). Likewise the large-paper version of the ending to The Golden Age Restored has always been regarded as the revised state by literary critics. 16 It is quite likely that we have in the outermost sheets of quires 4Q and ¶ a reversal of the pattern we have seen in quires 4M-4P, where the large-paper copies were demonstrably the first printed. On the other hand, the large-paper state of the only other reimpressed forme in these two quires, ¶3 r .4 v , printed with Skeleton 4C, precedes the variant state, which was printed with Skeleton 1B r .2C v ; the latter skeleton cannot have been composed until the two halves of Skeleton 1B were split apart, but Skeleton 1B is found intact on all copies of formes 4Q2 v .3 r and ¶3 v .4 r . The evidence suggests that the sheets printed with Skeleton 7 were reimpressions. Thus, the large-paper copies of sheet 4Q1.4 and some large-paper copies of sheet ¶1.6 were reimpressed after the printing of ¶3 r .4 v , a forme which seems to conform to the pattern of quires 4M-4P in that the large-paper version is manifestly the original. The alternative supposition, that the sidenotes on ¶6 r were deleted rather than added and that the revised ending of The Golden Age Restored ( i.e. , the large-paper version) is in fact the original, and the version ending with the speech of Pallas and the praise of Jove the revision, is much less likely. Why so many new skeletons should have appeared in these final quires is not wholly clear. We now know that Stansby interrupted the printing of The Surveyor to transfer Skeletons 5 and 6 to the Workes . It seems reasonable to suppose that the counting error which necessitated the resetting and reimposition in the final quires was discovered in the course of printing quire 4P, where we find two formes (4P3 v .4 r and 4P1 v .6 r ) which were not reimposed; we might then suppose that the discovery of the counting error caused Stansby to devote all of his resources to the completion of the Jonson Folio. The problem with this explanation is the fact that three of the four formes impressed with Skeletons 5 and 6—4P3 r .4 v , 4P2 v .5 r , and 4P2 r .5 v —were also printed short, as was ¶3 r .4 v . Because we can see when Skeletons 5 and 6 left and returned to The Surveyor , we have new evidence for the date of the completion of the Workes . Dr. Gerritsen concluded that the Jonson Folio was completed "not long after the beginning of summer" in 1616 (1959, p. 55). However, Rathborne's preface to the reader on A6 v of The Surveyor ends with the following: 'From my Lodging, at the house of M. ROGER BURGIS, against Salisburie-house-gate in the Strand, this sixt of Nouember , 1616.' Quire A contains the preliminaries of The Surveyor ; as one woúld expect, it was not the first quire in the volume to be printed. However, neither was it the last. The condition of the headline rules shows that quire A was printed some time between quires K and M. 17 The dated preface may have been delivered to Stansby with the rest of the book, in which case 16 quires or 47 sheets of the book were printed between the first week of November and the time of the original printing of quire 4P of the Workes . However, even if the dedication were written just before quire A was printed, at least seven or eight quires (A plus L or M through R), or 20-23 sheets of The Surveyor were printed between that time and the printing of 4P in the Workes . (We have already seen that Skeletons 5 and 6 entered Workes quire 4P between the printing of The Surveyor quires R and S.) At this point, eight sheets still remained to be printed in the Jonson Folio, not counting resetting and reimposition. Thus at the very least 25 edition sheets, and possibly 55 edition sheets, were printed between November 6 and the completion of the Jonson Workes . Stansby printed over 695 (and possibly over 700) edition sheets in 1616, which gives a monthly average of over 57 sheets. 18 No doubt the rates of production varied greatly, but this figure at least provides a point of reference: that about two weeks to a month passed between November 6 and the completion of the Workes seems a plausible estimate. Thus late November or early December, 1616 seems a likely date for the completion of the Jonson 1616 Folio. There is one more issue raised by the evidence of Skeletons 5 and 6 that I would like to mention, and that is the possibility of concurrent printing in Stansby's shop. When Skeletons 5 and 6 entered the Workes , 17 quires (A-R), or 51 sheets, of The Surveyor had already been printed, as well as 83 quires, or 249 sheets, of the Workes . I see no reason to suppose that the printing of the Workes was interrupted when the 17 Surveyor quires were printed; the headline rules in the Workes are too regular in their continuation from earlier quires. The Surveyor quires may well have been printed concurrently with the latter part of the Workes .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The only authoritative discussion to date of the printing history of the 1616 Workes is Johann Gerritsen, "Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio: A Preliminary Account," ES 40 (1959): 52-55. Dr. Gerritsen lists several surprising facts revealed by the headline evidence, including the printing of Every Man in His Humour out of sequence and at two widely separated intervals, and the extensive reimposition of unreset pages in the final quires. 2 I would like to express my gratitude to the staffs of the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Houghton Library, the Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library, and the Newberry Library and especially to the staff of the University of Wisconsin's Memorial Library for their assistance and cooperation. Special thanks are due to the Folger Shakespeare Library for photographing and allowing me to reproduce the pictures of the headlines appearing in this article. The facsimile referred to is The Workes of Benjamin Jonson, 1616, With an Introduction by D. Heyward Brock (1976). This copy was one of eight collated by the Oxford editors, that labelled "B2" in their "Survey of the Text" in Ben Jonson , ed. C. H. Herford and Percy and Evelyn Simpson (1925-1952), IX, 51-71. This edition is hereafter referred to as HS. The microfilm copies of the Jonson Folio are in the collection Early English Books, 1475-1640, Selected from Pollard and Redgrave's Short-Title Catalogue , University Microfilms Intl., Ann Arbor, Mich., reels 755 and 756; these are the copies called "M1" and "M2" respectively by the Oxford editors. The microprint copy is in the collection Three Centuries of Drama: English, 1512-1641 , ed. Henry Willis Wells, Readex Microprint. 3 Review of HS IX-XI, ES 38 (1957): 123. 4 The text of the masques ends on 4Q4 r ; 4Q4 v is a blank page. Quire 4Q is a gathering of two sheets. Here and elsewhere in this paper, when in a discussion of headlines one page of a forme is given within brackets, it is to be understood that the page has no headline. Although Dr. Gerritsen's is the only account of the reimposition of unreset pages in the Workes , it makes no mention of the headline variation in ¶3 r .4 v and 4Q1 r , and seems to deny the latter: "4Q was not reimposed or reset . . ." (1959, p. 55). 5 Quires A-F are printed with three skeletons, G-O with five, P-2N with six, 2O-2S with five, 2T-2Z with four, 3A-3N with five, 3O-3R with four, 3S-4A with two, 4B-4C with three, 4D-4O with four, and 4P, 4Q, and ¶ with five. These numbers do not include resetting or reimposition. Quires A-F, containing the text of Every Man in His Humour , are exceptional. As Gerritsen has shown, the play was printed out of sequence and at two separate intervals. It is not clear why the number of skeletons in use in quires 3S-4C fell so low. 6 The large-paper copies are discussed by William A. Jackson, The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library. English Literature 1475-1700 (1940), pp. 572-573. According to Jackson, "It is apparent from the imprints peculiar to the separate titles of the large-paper that such copies were the concern of Stansby alone, though he may not have had any for sale but solely for the author's use." Jackson, however, was certainly wrong in asserting that the large-paper copies always present the later state of variants; whereas the large-paper copies contain the later state of reset sheets G1.6 and G2.5, Gerritsen has shown (1959, p. 54) that the large-paper copies contain the earlier state of reset quire 2Y. Gerritsen's correction is supported by the evidence offered here concerning the later quires. 7 The verso headline of Skeleton o uses letters in its running title that are taken from Running title III; the bottom rule of the verso headline is the same as the recto upper rule in Skeletons 3B and 3C turned end to end. The recto headline of Skeleton o uses letters from Running title IX; its upper rule is the same as the bottom rule in the verso headline of Skeleton 3. 8 There is a textual variant in re-imposed 4N2 v .5 r not recorded by Herford and Simpson. On 4N2 v , in marginal note "c", the period drops out of "eyther. As". This cannot have been a deliberate change; the period may have been broken or pushed down or pulled in inking, after the forme was unlocked and reimposed, i.e. after its original imposition. 9 Here and afterwards, when reference is made to variants found in large-paper copies, it is to be understood that the original state of these variants appears in all large-paper copies as well as some small-paper copies. 10 There is one change in the letters of Running title VII (the verso running title of Skeleton 1B) when they enter the configuration labelled Skeleton 1B v .6 r : the original capital M has been replaced by a swash capital M . Both headlines in Skeleton 6 have a swash M ; when Running title VII was paired with the verso headline of Skeleton 6, the compositor probably gave it a swash M so that it would match its forme-mate, although this does not give a consistent appearance to the printed book, as these swash letters appear pages apart from each other. The swash M in the headlines of formes printed with Skeletons 6 and 1B v .6 r seem to have puzzled Simpson, whose account of the variation (HS IX, 71) is not very clear. The swash M is always and only found in pages imposed with Skeletons 6 and 1B v .6 r . 11 The rules of Skeletons 5 and 6 appear in the following pages of The Surveyor : Skeleton 5 verso rules: B2 v , C2 v , D3 v , D4 v , E2 v , E4 v , F5 v , G3 v , G4 v , G5 v , H4 v , H6 v , I1 v , I4 v , K2 v , K4 v , K6 v , L5 v , M3 v , M5 v , N1 v , N2 v , O1 v , O2 v , O3 v , P1 v , P3 v , P5 v , Q3 v , Q5 v , Q6 v , R4 v , R6 v , S3 v , S5 v , T4 v , V2 v , V4 v , V5 v Skeleton 5 recto rules: B2 r , B5 r , C1 r , C2 r , C5 r , D3 r , D4 r , E3 r , E5 r , F2 r , G2 r , G3 r , G4 r , H1 r , H3 r , I3 r , I6 r , K1 r , K3 r , K5 r , L2 r , M2 r , M4 r , N4 r , N5 r , N6 r , O4 r , O5 r , O6 r , P2 r , P4 r , P6 r , Q1 r , Q2 r , Q4 r , R3 r , R5 r , S2 r , S4 r , T3 r , V2 r , V3 r , V5 r Skeleton 6 verso rules: A4 v , A5 v , A6 v , D5 v , E1 v , F4 v , F6 v , G2 v , G6 v , H1 v , H2 v , I5 v , K3 v , K5 v , L2 v , L3 v , L6 v , M1 v , M2 v , N4 v , N5 v , N6 v , O4 v , O5 v , O6 v , P2 v , P4 v , P6 v , Q1 v , Q2 v , Q4 v , R1 v , R3 v , R5 v , S1 v , T1 v , T2 v , V1 v Skeleton 6 recto rules: A6 r , D2 r , E6 r , F1 r , G1 r , G5 r , H5 r , H6 r , I2 r , K2 r , K4 r , L1 r , L4 r , L5 r , M5 r , M6 r , N1 r , N2 r , N3 r , O1 r , O2 r , O3 r , P1 r , P3 r , P5 r , Q3 r , Q5 r , Q6 r , R2 r , R4 r , R6 r , S5 r , T1 r , T4 r , V1 r , V4 r , X3 r . Changes in the rules of Skeleton 6 are particularly striking. The verso rules change position between quires I and K and again between quires R and S. In quire A the rules are found as they appear from quires K-R. The recto rules have the same configuration as in their appearance in the Workes in quires N-R of The Surveyor only; in quires A-M the upper rule is turned end to end; in quires S-X both rules are turned end to end. 12 Herford and Simpson do not cite this press-variant in their survey of the text in vol. IX. Curiously, however, we find the following textual note in VII, 390: "rip'ned] ripned F1." 13 HS IX, 71. According to Jackson, op. cit. , "the nature of the changes" in the large-paper copies indicates that they present the later state. 14 Herford and Simpson regarded the 1616 folio as the authoritative text for all of the work it contains. They concluded that Jonson prepared the copy for the printers, read and corrected proofs, and introduced further corrections in the course of the volume's printing. "The basis for this decision was a thorough examination of [ Every Man Out of His Humour ] which, being the first play printed, is quite the most heavily corrected in the volume (Gerritsen, 1957, p. 121). Herford and Simpson recognized that the earlier works were much more heavily revised and corrected by Jonson than the later works in the folio: "The Masques . . . show no signs of the author's correction except on the last two pages, where he transposed effectively the final speeches. . . . Jonson cannot have read the proofs" (HS IX, 72). However, their edition is still based on the folio rather than the quarto texts of such works as the Haddington Masque , The Masque of Beauty , The Masque of Blacknesse , and Hymenaei , even though the earlier editions show more sign of the author's editorial care than the folio does. Thus, "the Herford-Simpson Jonson was ostensibly an edition of the works which by a mistaken choice of copy-text for many parts turned itself into an edition of the Folio" (Fredson Bowers, "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited," SB 31 (1978): 114). See also T. H. Howard-Hill, "Towards a Jonson Concordance," RORD 15-16 (1972-73): 17-32. 15 Gerritsen, 1959, p. 55. There the forme is wrongly named "3S2.5 v ," but that Gerritsen has 3S2 v .5 r in mind is clear; he refers to the recto page as the title-page to the Epigrammes . 16 According to Herford and Simpson, "The change must have been made by the author for literary reasons. He transposed the speeches of Pallas and Astraea, leaving the final word with the latter: returning to a transformed earth, she found a heaven there and wished to stay in it . . . for James was on the throne" (VII, 420). 17 See the description of the changes in the rules of Skeleton 6 in note 11 above. 18 Morrison lists the following works as printed in 1616 by Stansby: STC 345 (22 sheets), STC 1658 (70), STC 4099 (8), STC 7244 (9), STC 10639 (30), STC 12230 (10), STC 12256 (16), STC 14751 (258), STC 19059 (4), STC 20748 (62), STC 21019 (10), STC 23623 (3), STC 24371 (20), STC 25294 (10). These give a subtotal of 543 sheets. In addition to these, Peter Blayney has given me several more titles which he has found to have been printed by Stansby in 1616: STC 6488 (15 sheets), STC 7219 (31.5), STC 7472 (9.5), STC 11254 (1), STC 11941 (88), and STC 20914 (7). These add up to 152 sheets. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Blayney for his generosity and encouragement during my visit to the Folger Shakespeare Library. Morrison also lists 13715, a putative edition of Hooker's Laws which has since been shown to be a ghost. Book V of STC 13716, the 1619 edition of the Laws , is dated 1616 and is probably the source of the old STC entry; Book V consists of 24 sheets. Thus, depending on whether or not we include the 24 sheets of Book V of STC 13716, we have a total of either 695 or 719 sheets printed by Stansby in 1616.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The 1640 and 1653 Poems: By Francis Beaumont , Gent. and the Canon of Beaumont's Nondramatic Verse by William A. Ringler, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1640 Poems: By Francis Beaumont, Gent. (hereafter 40 ) and the augmented second edition of 1653 (hereafter 53 ) specifically attribute 47 poems to Beaumont, only eight of which are found attributed to him elsewhere, so these two volumes are the sole authorities for his authorship of 39 nondramatic poems totalling 2,026 lines. Since the first edition of this collection did not appear until 24 years, and the second edition not until 37 years after Beaumont's death, the reliability of the publishers and the authenticity of their attributions of authorship require examination. The first modern editor of Beaumont's poems, Alexander Chalmers, The Works of the English Poets , VI (1810), 173-221, reprinted the entire contents of 53 except the two poems attributed there to Randolph and Cleveland, contenting himself with the cautious observation that the publisher of that edition had "mixed, with Beaumont's, several pieces that belong to other authors." Henry Weber, The Works of Beaumont and Fletcher , XIV (1812), 345-447, printed as Beaumont's only 15 of the poems in 40 and only 14 of those added in 53 . Alexander Dyce, The Works of Beaumont and Fletcher , XI (1846), 439-513, printed as Beaumont's only 12 of the poems in 40 (Nos. 2, 6-9, 12, 14-17, 19, and 23), only four of the poems added in 53 ("Stand still," "Mortality behold," "The sun," and "Since thou"), and six from other sources (four commendatory poems to plays of Fletcher and Jonson, and two poems on the Countess of Rutland—"Madam so may" and "I may forget") for a total of 22. Dyce's edition still remains standard for the poems and his canon has been accepted by Peter Beal, Index of English Literary Manuscripts Volume I 1450-1625 , Part I (1980), 67-79, except for the rejection of three poems (Nos. 19 and 23 in 40 and "Mortality behold" in 53 ) and the addition of three new poems ("Good Madam Fowler," "Neither to follow," and "Why should not," his Nos. BmF 117-132, 137-140, and 144-150). Francis Beaumont was a gentleman, the son of a judge of the court of common pleas and a student at Oxford and the Inner Temple who later married an heiress of a county family. He shared with the other gentlemen of his time their aversion to having their writings printed and probably wrote his plays and poems for the pleasure it afforded him rather than to make money. In 1613 he wrote The Maske of the Inner Temple and Grayes Inn to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth, which was printed with two copies having "By Francis Beaumont Gent." on the title page, but with the remaining extant copies having a cancel title of the same setting of type from which his name has been removed (Fredson Bowers, The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , I (1966), 113). Aside from The Maske , only three of the plays in which he had a hand appeared in print during his lifetime: The Woman Hater , 1607, The Knight of the Burning Pestle , 1613, and Cupids Revenge , 1615. The first two of these appeared anonymously and the third under the name of John Fletcher alone. He made no effort to establish his reputation as a playwright or poet in print, and indeed took pains to avoid having his works published under his own name. The only writings whose publication he authorized, other than The Maske , were four commendatory poems for plays of personal friends: Jonson's Volpone , 1607, Fletcher's The Faithfull Shepheardesse , 1610?, Jonson's Epicœne (entered 1610 but not printed until 1620), and Catiline , 1611. These commendatory verses were signed with his name; no manuscript copies survive. Aside from these commendatory verses and the poems in 40 and 53 , only three poems circulated with Beaumont's name attached in prints or manuscripts of the seventeenth century, and only three others with his initials. I discuss these below. [A] I may forget to eat, to drinke, to sleepe. 116 or 118 lines in couplets. First printed as anonymous, "An Elegie on the Death of the Lady Rutland," in the ninth impression of Sir Thomas Ouerbury His Wife , 1616, A5 v —6 v (STC 18911), reprinted by Dyce (XI, 507-511) from the 1622 edition of Overbury (STC 18913), and listed by Beal (No. 27-55). Elizabeth, the only child of Sir Philip Sidney, married Roger fifth Earl of Rutland and died without issue 1 September 1612. Both Ben Jonson in his Conversations with Drummond (Herford and Simpson Works , I, 158) and John Earle in his lines on the death of Beaumont ( 40 , K1) report that he wrote an elegy on the Countess of Rutland. Among the manuscripts I have seen, the lines are attributed to Beaumont by name in three (Bodl. Rawl poet 160 f. 41 v , Brit. Lib. Stowe 962 f. 42 v , and Trinity College Dublin 877 f. 257), by initials in four (Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 37 p. 38, Brit. Lib. Add. 23229 f. 63 and Harley 6038 f. 23 v , Edinburgh Univ. Lib. La. III. 493, f. 109 v ), to I. D. in two (Bodl. Eng. poet. f. 9 p. 143 and Harvard fMS Eng 986.1 f. 47 v ); and are anonymous in four (Bodl. Douce f. 5 f. 35 v and Rawl. poet. 117 f. 184 rev, Brit. Lib. Egerton 2230 f. 6 v and Harley 1221 f. 27). Beal does not indicate whether or not his additional texts (Nos. 32, 39-40, 42-43, 45-52, and 54-55) are attributed. [B] Madam so may my verses pleasing be. 70 lines in couplets. First printed as "An Elegie [sic] by F. B." beginning "So Madam . . ." and subscribed "Fr. Beau:" in [Henry Fitzgeffray's] Certain Elegies . Done by Sundrie Excellent Wits , 1618, A2-3 (STC 10945.3). A different text was printed as anonymous, "Ad Comitissam Rutlandiae," in the eleventh impression of Sir Thomas Ouerbury His Wife , 1622, C4-5 (STC 18913), followed by [A] above. Printed by Dyce (XI, 505-507) from Overbury's 1622 Wife , and listed by Beal (Nos. 1-26). In the manuscripts I have seen, it is subscribed "Fra. Be." in Brit. Lib. Add. 25303 f. 103 v , "Fr. B." in Harley 3910 f. 16 v , "F. B." in Brit. Lib.

Not mentioned by Dyce; listed by Beal (Nos. 117-132) who reports that it is ascribed to Francis Beaumont in six MSS (Brit. Lib. Add. 33998 f. 71, Egerton 2026 f. 67 ("F. Beo."), and Harley 6993 f. 70; Rosenbach Foundation 243/4 p. 13; Trinity College Dublin 877 f. 234 v ; and Yale Osborn Collection b 200 p. 218); to F. B. in three (Bodl.

Three other poems have been attributed to Beaumont on the basis of initials only, an uncertain identification because more than two dozen STC authors have the initials F. B. [D] My new-borne Muse assaies her tender wing. Six lines in couplets. A commendatory poem before the anonymous The Metamorphosis of Tabacco , 1602, A4 v (STC 1695), headed "In laudem Authoris" and subscribed "F. B." Dyce noted that "the late G. Chalmers had a copy . . . on the title-page of which was written in a contemporary hand 'by John Beaumont'" (I, xiii note p). On the basis of Dyce's note, A. B. Grosart accepted the authorship of Sir John and asserted that the initials F. B. "unquestionably belong to his brother the Dramatist" ( The Poems of Sir John Beaumont. Bart. , 1869, p. xxvi). The hand-written note "by John Beaumont" does not occur in any of the seven extant copies of the Metamorphoses , and Roger Sell points out that it is not at all the kind of poem that the seriously moral Sir John is otherwise known to have written ( N&amp;Q , 117 [Jan. 1972], 10-13), and neither is it included in the collected edition of his verse, Bosworth-field , edited by his son in 1629. Not listed by Beal. If the Metamorphosis was not written by the nineteen-year old John Beaumont, no reason remains to equate the initials "F.B." with his seventeen-year old brother Francis. [E] Neither to follow fashion nor to showe. 44 lines in couplets. Headed "To M r B: J:" and subscribed "FB" in Pierpont Morgan Library MA 1057, p. 110, printed by E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare, II (1930), 222-225. Headed "To Ben Ionson. T. B." in Brit. Lib. Add. 30982 f. 75 v , anonymous in Folger V. a. 96 f. 71 v and Huntington HM 198 Part II f. 116. Not mentioned by Dyce; listed by Beal (BmF 137-140). Chambers said: "In view of the variant initials, one cannot be quite sure of the author. But I see no reason why it should not be Francis Beaumont, who wrote another well-known verse epistle to Jonson, and to whom the theatrical allusions in ll. 28, 30 would be natural." He dates the composition 1615. The attribution must remain doubtful. [F] Why should not Pilgrims to thy body come. 26 lines in couplets. First printed from Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 37 p. 30 by John Wardroper, Love and Drollery , 1969, No. 213. Not mentioned by Dyce; Beal lists seven MSS (BmF 144-150). Four are subscribed "F. B." (Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 37 p. 30 and Eng. poet. f. 9 p. 207, Harvard Eng. 966.7 f. 16, and Yale Osborn Collection b 148 p. 150); one is subscribed "I. D." (Brit. Lib. Add. 25707 f. 60 v ); one is doubtful, because the following leaf containing the last 13 lines is lacking (Trinity College Dublin 877 p. 443); and one is anonymous (Morgan MA 1057 p. 64). Attribution by initials only is hazardous. It is clear from the above that, aside from The Maske of the Inner Temple and Grayes Inn and the poems in 40 and 53 , seventeenth-century readers could have known only five poems attributed to Beaumont in print between 1607 and 1620 (the four commendatory poems to Jonson and Fletcher and the letter to Lady Rutland "Madam so may") and only two others that circulated in manuscript under his name (the elegy on Lady Rutland "I may forget," and the jesting letter "Good Madam Fowler"). Of the three poems subscribed "F. B." the first [D] must be rejected out of hand and the other two [E, F] must remain doubtful. Only four of the 17 poems attributed to Beaumont in 40 are attributed to him elsewhere (Nos. 2, 6, 7, and 9), and only four of the 109 items added in 53 ( The Maske G6—M1 v and the letter to Jonson "The sun" L5 v —6 v in earlier prints, and "Since thou" and "Stand still" F2-3v in manuscript). This leaves 40 and 53 as the sole authorities for attributing 31 poems to Beaumont. In what follows I examine seriatim the contents of each volume and assess the authenticity of their attributions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1640 Volume The title page of 40 (STC 1665) reads: "POEMS: | BY | FRANCIS BEAUMONT , | Gent. | Viz . | The Hermaphrodite. | The Remedie of Love. | Elegies. | Sonnets, with other Poems. | — | LONDON, | Printed by Richard Hodgkinson for W [illiam]. W [ethered]. | and Laurence Blaikelocke and are | to be sold at the signe of the | Sugar-loafe next Temple | Bar in Fleet-street. | 1640." It contains 40 leaves, A—K 4 . This volume was produced by a small but established printer and two young men who were just beginning their careers as publishers. Richard Hodgkinson, the printer, usually printed one or two books a year between 1630 and 1663, and never more than seven, except that in 1640 he was unusually active and produced eighteen volumes. Laurence Blaikelocke, the principal publisher, took up his freedom in 1638 and published at premises near Temple Bar until 1654. He published two books in 1639 and four in 1640. On 2 September 1639 he entered on the Stationers' Register "a Booke called Salmacis and Hermaphroditus or the Hermaphrodite , a Poem, by ffrancis Beomont" (Arber, IV, 474), for which he had obtained a license on 31 August (see imprimatur on E4). William Wethered took up his freedom in 1637 and his name occurs in the Stationers' Register until 1646, but the only extant volume with which he is definitely associated as publisher is the 1640 Beaumont poems (see A Dictionary of Printers by McKerrow, 1910, and Plomer, 1907, and Morrison's Index of Printers , 1961 and 1955). On 7 October 1639 he entered in the Stationers' Register " Poems by ffrancis Beomont . gent. vizt t . Remedium Amoris . The Passion of Christ with diuers Elegies . Also a Poem against stargaizers &amp;c by Master John ffletcher," for which he paid sixpence, the entry fee for a single volume (Arber, IV, 482). In order to forward their newly begun businesses both Blaikelocke and Wethered were evidently on the lookout for old texts by popular authors that they could persuade the wardens of the Stationers' Company were unassigned. Actually Salmacis and Hermaphroditus had previously been published by John Hodgets in 1602, but it had not been entered in the Stationers' Register. The Passion of Christ may have been an otherwise unknown poem, or it may have been Joseph Fletcher's Christs Bloodie Sweat , which had been duly entered and published by R. Blower in 1613; but if it was, the change of title misled the wardens, and Wethered did not publish it anyway. The volume resulting from the Stationers' Register entries by Blaikelocke and Wethered appears to have been set in type piecemeal and to have undergone three or four changes in content during the course of composition. Blaikelocke evidently had at first intended to publish only Salmacis and Hermaphroditus under Beaumont's name, and his volume of five quarto gatherings was probably already in type and perhaps printed, with the imprimatur on E4 (E4 v is blank), when he joined forces with Wethered. The Remedie of Love was then added on F1-H2 and the word "FINIS" placed at the end of the text on H2. At this point the decision was probably made to add another group of poems, so the catchword "AN" was placed at the bottom of H2 and "An Elegie on the Ladie Markham" and ten other poems, the last two being in commendation of Beaumont, were set in type on H2 v —K2. As this left two leaves of the final gathering blank, two more poems (Nos. 22-23) were added to fill the blank pages. Later in the course of printing, the word "FINIS" was removed from H2, with the result that some of the surviving copies (Bodleian Ashmole 1663 and Malone 784, Harvard Britwell, Huntington) appear with and some (Harvard, Morgan, Newberry) without it. Blaikelocke was clearly the leading spirit in the enterprise. He signed the dedication, with the statement that the "Poems" (note the plural) were "the issue of brave Beaumonts braine," his Salmaces [sic] and Hermaphroditus appears first in the volume, and only the address of his place of business is given on the title page. Later he was probably solely responsible for the augmented second edition of 1653. The second major poem in the 1640 volume, The Remedie of Love , had been entered and attributed to Beaumont by Wethered. It is impossible to determine which of the two publishers of 40 was responsible for adding the remaining poems on H2 v —K4; the first eleven may have been the "diuers Elegies" that Wethered entered, though it is also possible that they had been collected and attributed to Beaumont by Blaikelocke. Of the 23 poems in the 1640 edition, six (Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 20, 21) are Blaikelocke's dedication and commendatory poems attributed in the text to other authors; the remaining 17 items the title page implies and Blaikelocke in his prefatory poem asserts are by Francis Beaumont. In what follows I set forth the evidence for the authorship of each of the poems in 40 . All of them, except No. 13, were reprinted in 53 , A1-4 v , and B1-E3 v , with the same attributions. [1] WEre these but worthlesse Poems or light Rimes. A2 r — v . 24 lines in couplets. Headed " To the worshipfull Robert Ducie . . ." and subscribed "Laurence Blaikelocke." The publisher's dedication, readdressed to "Robert Parkhurst Esq" in 53 . Nos. 2-7 were printed, with some changes, from the anonymous Salmacis and Hermaphroditus , printed at London [by Simon Stafford] for Iohn Hodgets, 1602 (STC 18972—hereafter O2 ). [2] IT is a statute in deep wisdoms lore. A3. 14-line sonnet. Headed "To the true Patronesse of all Poetrie, Caliope" and subscribed "F.B." Not subscribed in O2 . [3] LIke to the weake estate of a poore friend. A3 v . 14-line sonnet. "In laudem Authoris," subscribed W. B. as in O2 . [4] EIther the goddesse drawes her troopes of loves. A3 v . 14-line sonnet. "To the Authour," subscribed J. B. as in O2 . [5] THe matchlesse lust of a faire poesie. A4. Three sixains. "To the Author," subscribed J. F. (A. F. in O2 , which reads "The matchlesse Lustre of faire poesie.") [6] I Sing the fortune of a lucklesse paire. A4 v . Ten lines ababcdcdee. "The Author to the Reader," unsubscribed as in O2 . [7] MY wanton lines doe treat of amorous love. B1-E3 v . 920 lines in couplets. (922 lines in O2 ). " Salmaces &amp; Hermaphroditus , or The Hermaphrodite." Dyce printed Nos. 2-7 from 40 (XI, 443-471) because he did not have access to O2 ; Beal listed Nos. 2, 6, and 7 (BmF 133-136). J. Payne Collier, The Works of Shakespeare , I (1844), cxvi note 3, was the first to note that Nos. 2-7 were reprinted from O2 . He called 40 a "fraudulent reprint" and did not accept the attribution to Beaumont because in 1602 "Beaumont was only sixteen [actually seventeen], and the first edition has no name nor initials to the address 'To Calliope,' to which Blaickelocke in 1640, for his own book-selling purpose, thought fit to add the letters F. B. In the same way, he changed the initials to a commendatory poem from A. F. to I. F., in order to make it appear as if John Fletcher had applauded his friend's early verses." Dyce commented, "Mr. Collier may be right; but my own impression is, that it really was the production of Beaumont's youth," and printed Nos. 2-7 from 40 . The next year an editor signing himself "Dramaticus" reprinted the entire text of the Bodleian copy of O2 (then thought unique) in Shakespeare Society Papers , III (1847), 98-126. He noted the addition of the initials "F. B." to the author's address to Calliope, the change of "A. F." to "I. F." after a commendatory poem, and that "the name of Francis Beaumont no where appears," and so concluded that, "without going to the extent of asserting positively that he had no hand whatever in it, it may be strongly doubted whether Blaiklock did not impute it to him fraudulently, in order to avail himself of the popularity of Beaumont's name" (p. 94). Since 1847 the O2 text of Salmacis has been three times reprinted: by Gwyn Jones, Golden Cockerel Press, 1951; by Elizabeth Story Donno in Elizabethan Minor Epics , 1963; and by Nigel Alexander in Elizabethan Narrative Verse , 1967. Jones considered the attribution to Beaumont "unproved and unconvincing" (p. 7), Donno merely observed that it was attributed to Beaumont in 40 , and Alexander apparently accepted the attribution but without explanation. Hallet Smith, Elizabethan Poetry , 1952, p. 70 note 20, accepted the argument of "Dramaticus" and concluded that the authorship "remains unknown." O2 was not entered on the Stationers' Register and has no author's name on the title page nor after the first and last of the introductory poems which are written in the person of the author. It is the earliest and most accurate text, with only two manifest typographical errors (7.115 "burn sht" for "burnisht" and 647 "sto'ne" for "stol'n") and has only a single word (7.757 "was smooth" for "is smooth") emended by modern editors ( 40 , properly I think, also emended 7.52 "for" to "for's", 139 "their" to "the", 371 "quiuers" to "quiuer", and 473 "drinking" to "parting"). 40 , A3-E3 v , has the same contents in the same order as O2 and is clearly a direct reprint, though carelessly done. It has at least 40 typographical errors, and more than 60 other deliberate changes from O2 in its text. Some I believe are proper emendations (as the four listed above), but many are arbitrary substitutions that neither change nor improve the meaning (4.8 "faire" for "fine", 7.6 "These" for "The", 53 "and 'twas" for "that was", etc.). Some deliberately change the phrasing where that of O2 appears perfectly satisfactory (5.10 "more rare invention" for "more mouing passion", 7.32 "could not choose but kisse" for "did of purpose kisse", etc.). Others are emendations that betray a lack of understanding of the text. Thus at 7.176 where O2 has "entred" 40 reads "entring", which destroys the grammatical structure of the sentence; and 40 omits lines 373-374 of O2 . But despite these editorial changes, there are numerous direct textual links between O2 and 40 which show that an annotated copy of O2 itself was the printer's copy for 40 . Thus though the compositor of 40 imposed his own patterns of accidentals on his copy and gave it a more modern appearance, a few older or unusual spellings reappear in 40 , as 3.10 "Epithites", 7.169 "promooters," and 577 "Mayre-maids" ( O2 "Mair-maids"). Of more significance are the duplication of typographical peculiarities, such as the failure to italicize the second proper name in 7.110 " Pelion . . . mighty Osse"; or 40 being led astray by the typographical error at 7.647, where O2 reads "let my sport be sto'ne" and 40 , failing to see that "sto'ne" was a typographical error for "stol'n", rewrote the passage as "let her name be known." There are four manuscript copies of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus of the second quarter of the seventeenth century or later, all of which derive directly or indirectly from one or other of the prints. Cambridge University Library Mm. 4. 13 was copied directly from O2 , as shown by close agreement in readings, and is anonymous like its original. Brit. Lib. Add. 33988, ff. 16-29 v , transcribed after 1647, is headed "Salmacis and Hermaphroditus a Poem written by ffrancis Beaumont"; but it was copied directly from 40 , as shown by its omission of lines 373-374 and numerous other agreements in error, so its attribution has no independent value. The two remaining manuscripts, Kent Archives Office U1121 Z14 and Bodl. Rawl. poet. 120, ff. 92-122, share over a hundred peculiar readings, many of them manifest errors (3.5 "muse", 4.7 "watry Nymphs", 5.3 "raisinge maiesty", 7.63 "Vp to", 74 "clearer grace", 78 "Queene of", 99 "sides there", etc.), and omissions (7.285-286, 817, 819-821), which show that they descend from an exclusive common ancestor (X). That X was a direct transcript of O2 is shown by both manuscripts having the five preliminary poems subscribed as in O2 ; by the general tenor of their readings which agree with O2 against 40 ; by their preservation of probable errors of O2 at 7.52 "for", 473 "drinkinge", and 757 "was smooth"; and even by the preservation of accidentals characteristic of O2 , such as the spellings 7.58 "abilliments", 424 "sate", 515 "bever", 580 "swarfy", and 720 "rosiat". Kent Archives Office U1121 Z14, a separate manuscript of 14 leaves, first noticed by Beal (I thank Mr. D. C. Gibson for further information and a xerox), is a moderately accurate text which omits 16 lines, repeats eight (notably 7.665-666 after 854), and has at the end, "finis / FRANCIS BEAMONT." Bodl. Rawl. poet. 120, ff. 91-122, was originally a separate manuscript of 32 leaves, carelessly transcribed with the omission of 64 scattered lines and the repetition of nine others. Prior to its being bound with three other manuscripts, the first and last probably damaged leaves were discarded and a substitute final leaf of different paper stock was added. On the recto of this was written, in different ink by a different but not much later hand, the last eight lines of Salmacis with the subscription, "Finis / Francis Beaumont / 1634." The most reasonable inference would seem to be that the second scribe drew his text and subscription from the damaged last leaf of the original he replaced or from X, and that X and probably the Rawlinson original had been transcribed in 1634. The attribution to Beaumont in both these manuscripts must come from X, which was a transcript, probably made in 1634, of the anonymous O2 . Since the attribution was not in X's original, it must have been added by X's scribe, who wrote after Beaumont's death. Since X's attribution is late and from an unknown source, it provides only doubtful corroboration of the suspect testimony of 40 . G. C. Macaulay, Francis Beaumont a Critical Study (1883), 197-200, rejected the attribution of Salmacis to Beaumont because "it is so entirely different in character from his other works." C. M. Gayley, Beaumont the Dramatist (1914), 41, accepted the attribution because, "Both diction and verse display characteristics not foreign to Beaumont's heroic couplets in epistle and elegy, nor to the blank verse of his dramas,—though they do not markedly distinguish them." Philip J. Finkelpearl ( N&amp;Q , October 1969, pp. 367-368) pointed out parallels between Salmacis and The Metamorphosis of Tabacco , dubiously attributed to Francis's brother John, as evidence that the two brothers were acquainted with each other's work, parallels which Roger Sell ( N&amp;Q , January 1972, p. 11) brands as "all classical allusions of the kind which are the stock-in-trade of the Ovidian poet," and so of no probative value as evidence of acquaintance. Impressions vary, stylistic criteria are uncertain. Cyrus Hoy ("The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon III," SB , 11 [1958], 87) concluded that it is "quite impossible to establish for Beaumont a neat pattern of linguistic preferences that will serve as a guide to identifying his work." So we must depend primarily upon external evidence, which in this case is uncertain. [8] WHen Cupid read this Title, straight he said. 580 lines in couplets. F1-H2. "THE REMEDIE OF LOVE." An apparently unique text, entered and attributed to Beaumont by Wethered on 7 October 1639. Printed by Dyce (XI, 446-471); not listed by Beal because no manuscript could be found. This is in part a metaphrase but in the main an original rehandling of the material of Ovid's Remedia Amoris . Ovid's poem was translated or paraphrased several times in the early seventeenth century. One version by F. L. was printed in 1600 (STC 18794), another by Sir Thomas Overbury in 1620 (STC 18975), and a third by J. Carpenter in 1636 (STC 18976). Thomas Heywood said he had translated the entire work, but only the few lines he quoted in Troia Britannica , 1609, survive (STC 13366). All four of these texts differ markedly from the one printed here, and Wethered remains the only known authority for attributing it to Beaumont. [9] AS unthrifts groan in straw for their pawn'd beds. 68 or 70 lines in couplets. First printed with the heading "An Elegie on the Lady Markham" in 40 , H2 v -3 v . Reprinted by Dyce (XI, 503-505) and listed by Beal (56-83). This exercise of wit in the form of an elegy on the friend and relative of Lucy Countess of Bedford, the widowed Bridget Markham who died at Twickenham on 4 May 1609 and on whom Donne also wrote an elegy, is attributed by name to Beaumont in Brit. Lib. Add 30982 f. 50, Stowe 962 f. 82 v , and Huntington HM 198 Part I p. 11, and by initials in Bodl. Ashmole 38 f. 77 and Brit. Lib. Add. 25707 f. 30 v . It is attributed to I. D. in Bodl. Eng. poet f. 9 p. 199 and Harvard Eng. 966.1 f. 48, to A. P. (the scribe) in Brit. Lib. Stowe 962 f. 19, and is anonymous in Brit. Lib. Add. 23229 f. 66 v (from 40 ), Egerton 2230 f. 3 v , and Sloane 1446 f. 72 v , Bodl. Rawl. poet. 117 f. 193, and Rawl. poet. 160 f. 27 v , and the Digby MS printed in N&amp;Q 3 (1851), 367 (lines 49-70 only). Beal does not indicate whether or not his added Nos. 60, 68-70, 70.5, 71, and 73-82 are attributed. This is the only poem in 40 whose attribution to Beaumont is adequately substantiated from other sources. [10] CAn my poore lines no better office have. 20 lines in couplets. H4. " AN ELEGIE ." Chalmers (VI, 184) observed that "these lines are part of Sir John Beaumont's Elegy on the lady Marquesse of Winchester [d. Oct. 1614] inserted here probably from an oversight of the editor." Sir John was Francis's elder brother; the verses printed by 40 are lines 1-18 with a new concluding couplet of a 100-line poem "Of the truly Noble and Excellent Lady, the Lady Marquesse of Winchester," in Sir John's posthumously published Bosworth-field , 1629, L8-M1 v . Since 40 contains verbal variants in eight of its first 18 lines, its text probably derives from a now untraced manuscript rather than directly from the 1629 print. Rejected by Dyce and not listed by Beal. [11] SLeepe, old man, let silence charme thee. 24 lines a 4 b 3 a 4 b 3 trochaic. H4 v . "A Charme." J. P. Collier, A Catalogue . . . of the Library at Bridge-water House , 1837, pp. 26-27, listed a copy of 40 inscribed, "For the Right Ho ble John Earle of Bridgwater my much Honourd Lord from his Lord es most humblest servant Henry Lawes," in which after this poem the same hand has written, "H: H: this coppy of verses was made by Henry Harrington &amp; set by Henry Lawes 1636." The Bridge-water copy of 40 is now in the Huntington Library (60332) and contains the manuscript inscriptions that Collier quoted, which appear to be Lawes's holograph. Furthermore, the text of the poem with a musical setting appears in Lawes's manuscript collection of his own musical compositions, Brit. Lib. Add. 53723, f. 20 item 40. (see Pamela J. Willetts, The Henry Lawes Manuscript , 1969, pp. 38-39). In this manuscript the verses themselves are anonymous, but Lawes indicated the authors of only two of the 383 poems he set, and 17 folios later, where he entered his settings for Milton's Comus , he noted only that "the 5 songes followinge were sett for A Maske presented at Ludlo Castle, before y e Earle of Bridgwater Lord president of y e Marches. October. 1634." Lawes also set five other songs by Henry Harington which he printed in his Ayres and Dialogues , 1653, 1655, and 1658. Another anonymous manuscript text of No. 11, also headed "A Charme" as in 40 , is preserved in Bodl. Eng. poet. c.50 f. 33 of the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Rejected by Dyce (XI, 442) on the basis of Collier's report, and by Beal (p. 67), who adds four more presumably anonymous manuscript texts in the Folger, National Library of Wales, New York Public, and Rosenbach Foundation Libraries. See also No. 18 below. [12] FOndly, too curious Nature, to adorne. 32 lines in couplets. I1 r-v . " On the Marriage of a Beauteous young Gentlewoman , with an Ancient man ." An apparently unique text. Printed as doubtfully Beaumont's by Dyce (XI, 488-489). Not listed by Beal because he found no manuscript. [13] CAtch me a Starre, that's falling from the Sky. 8 lines in couplets. I1 v . "Womans Mutability." This poem is similar in subject to Donne's "Go and catch a falling star." A variant text, titled "On womans inconstancy" and beginning "Goe catch a star," was printed in Wits Recreations , 1640, E3, and 1641, D7, all of whose items are anonymous. The 40 text with a musical setting by John Playford was printed in his Select Ayres and Dialogues , 1659, D2. There are seven anonymous manuscript texts varying greatly in wording and even in order of lines: Bodl. Ashmole 47 f. 36, Malone 21 f. 45 v , Rawl poet f. 8; Brit. Lib. Add. 30982 f. 26, Sloane 1867 f. 24 (from Wits Recreaations ), Stowe 962 f. 31 v ; Corpus Christi College Oxford 328 f. 19. In an eighth manuscript, Brit. Lib. Harley 6057 f. 15, the lines are subscribed "Iohn Dunne," but since the text of this was copied directly from the anonymous 1640 or 1641 Wits Recreations the ascription can have little authority. This is the only poem in 40 that was not reprinted in 53 , and its variant was also unaccountably omitted from the 1645 and later editions of Wits Recreations . Omitted by Dyce without comment and not listed by Beal. [14] COld vertue guard me, or I shall endure. 34 lines in couplets. I2 r-v . "The Glance." A slightly variant text, headed "On A Ladies Tempting Eye" and subscribed "Iohn: Rutter:" is in Brit. Lib. Harley 6917 f. 45, transcribed about the middle of the seventeenth century. The DNB identifies this John with Joseph Rutter, whose only published work is a play, The Shepheards Holy-Day , 1635, which does not contain this poem. Printed as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 489-494). Beal (BmF 96) lists the Harleian manuscript only. [15] FLattering hope, away, and leave me. 30 lines aabbcC8. I2 v -3. " A Sonnet ." An apparently unique text. Dyce (XI, 490-491) prints as doubtful. Not listed by Beal because he found no manuscript. [16] MAy I finde a woman faire. 20 lines aabb8. I3. " True Beauty ." An identical anonymous text with the same title is in Wits Recreations , 1645, T7 v , and later editions. Since the editor of the 1645 Wits Recreations also corrected its text of No. 23 by reference to 40 , it is clear that he took his text of No. 16 from the same source. An anonymous text in the late seventeenth-century Brit. Mus. Harley 3991 f. 138 was copied from 53 . Printed as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 491), and listed by Beal (BmF 141-143) who adds Folger V. A. 308 f. 138 and New York Public Library, Music Division Drexel 4257 No. 195 but does not indicate whether they are attributed. [17] NEver more will I protest. 18 lines aabbcc8. I3 v . " The Indifferent ." Another probably substantive text, transcribed by William Elyott c. 1655, is anonymous in Bodl. Rawl. poet. 116 f. 53 v ; an anonymous text in the late seventeenth-century Brit. Mus. Harley 3991 f. 131 v was copied from 53 . Printed as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 492) and listed by Beal (BmF 97-99) who adds New York Public Library, Music Division, Drexel 4257 No. 36 but does not indicate whether it is attributed. [18] WHy should man be only ty'd. 30 lines ababcC7 trochaic. I4. " Loves freedome ." Henry Lawes, in the copy of 40 now in the Huntington Library (see above under No. 11), and reported by Collier in the Bridge-water Catalogue, wrote at the end of this poem, "H. H: this Songe was made by Henry Harrington &amp; set by Henry Lawes 1636." The text and musical setting is in Lawes's manuscript collection of his own compositions, Brit. Lib. Add. 53723 f. 33 v No. 67. An anonymous text in the late seventeenth-century Brit. Lib. MS Harley 3991 f. 135 v , was copied from 53 . Rejected by Dyce (XI, 442) on the basis of Collier's report, and by Beal (pp. 67-68) who adds another presumably anonymous text in Harvard MS Eng. 628, pp. 335-336. [19] LIke to the falling of a Starre. 12 lines in tetrameter couplets. I4 v . " On the Life of Man ." George Ellis, in the third edition of his Specimens of the Early English Poets , III (1803), 69, printed the 40 text as Beaumont's but noted, "This is also contained in Bishop King's Poems, 1657." It is printed on K5 of the anonymously published Poems Elegies , Paradoxes , and Sonnets of Henry King with the title "Sic Vita." Dyce (XI, 492-493) was uncertain of the validity of the attribution to King and printed it as doubtfully Beaumont's. Miss Margaret Crum, Poems of Henry King , 1965, p. 255, demonstrates that it is unquestionably King's. It is preserved in seven manuscripts (see Miss Crum's list, p. 148) the evidence of three of which is decisive for the canon of King. Beal (p. 67) attributes it to King. 40 is the earliest print. [20] HE that had Youth, and Friends, and so much Wlt [sic]. 6 lines in couplets. H4 v . " On Francis Beaumonts death ." Alexander Chalmers, The English Poets , VI (1810), 202, included this in his reprint of 53 but noted, "By Bishop Corbet. Altered by the bishop afterwards. See his poems." This is a reference to Chalmers's own edition of Corbet's poems (V, 257), which is based on Octavius Gilchrist's 1807 edition. Gilchrist took his text, which varies considerably from 40 , from the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio ( BF ), d3, where it is subscribed "Rich. Corbet. D. D." An anonymous text varying from both 40 and BF is in Wits Recreations , 1641, R8. The verses do not appear in the early collections of Corbet's poems, Certain Elegant Poems , Written By Dr. Corbet, Bishop of Norwich , 1647, and Poëtica Stromata . . . of R. C. , 1648. J. A. W. Bennett and H. R. Trevor-Roper, The Poems of Richard Corbett , 1955, pp. 23 and 115, unquestioningly accept Corbet's authorship and print the poem from 40 , the earliest printed text, with variants from BF , Wits Recreations , and the anonymous Bodl. MS Eng. poet. e. 14 f. 93 v rev. Two manuscript texts, Brit. Lib. Add. 21433 f. 177 v , and Add. 25303 f. 120, derive from BF , but three other anonymous manuscript texts (Brit. Lib. Add. 15227, f. 82 v , Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 14 f. 93 v rev., and Brit. Lib. Lansdowne 777 f. 67) are substantive and superior in accuracy to BF , Wits Recreations , and 40 . Indeed, when the stemma is worked out, Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 14 appears to be the best text and BF to be related to the corrupt Wits Recreations . At least one corrupt intermediary lies between BF and the archetype, so that BF 's unique testimony to Corbet's authorship is suspect. [21] BEaumont lies here, and where now shall we have. 90 lines in couplets. K1-2. "An Elegie upon Master Francis Beaumont" subscribed "I. Earle." Also subscribed "Joh. Earle" in BF and "Io: Earles" in Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 97 p. 55; anonymous in Bodl. Ashmole 47 f. 44 v and Corpus Christi College Oxford 328 f. 66 v . The attribution of this poem to Earle and No. 9 to Beaumont are the only adequately substantiated attributions in the whole of the 1640 volume. [22] HEre she lies, whose spotlesse fame. 18 lines in tetrameter couplets. K2 v . "An Epitaph". Weber reprinted this as Beaumont's in 1812, but observed in his preface (I, cxxi) that he had afterwards found a manuscript note in a copy of the 1660 reissue of 53 which stated that the lines were written "on Mrs. Ann Littleton, who dy'd 6th February, 1625, and lies buried in the Temple Church." Her monument no longer exists in Temple Church—most of the stones were removed in 1642 and stored in the triforium where they were destroyed by bombing in 1942 (David Lower, The Temple Church , 1967, p. 8); but William Dugdale recorded the date of Anne Littleton's interment in Origines Juridicales , 1666, p. 177. Anthony Munday copied the verses, which were probably painted on a board hung over the grave, and the tombstone inscription, in the additions to his 1633 edition of John Stow's Survey of London , p. 762, and young William Sancroft also copied them into his collection of epitaphs in Bodl. Sancroft 59 p. 291 rev. Beaumont, who died in 1616, could not have written an epitaph for a lady who died in 1623/4. Rejected by Dyce on the basis of Weber's report, and by Beal. [23] LIke a Ring, without a Finger. 80 lines aabbccD8. K3-4. " A Sonnet ." In an appendix to her Poems of Henry King , pp. 254-255, Miss Crum has demonstrated that this poem is a parody—and that likewise No. 19 by King is an imitation—of a twelve-line stanza beginning "Like to the damaske Rose you see," printed with a second stanza by Francis Quarles at the end of his Argalus and Parthenia , 1629, X4, and also printed the same year, with four different following stanzas, in Simon Wastell's Microbiblion , Z4 v -5. The two stanzas printed by Quarles were set to music by Henry Lawes in the manuscript collection of his own compositions, Brit. Lib. MS Add. 53723, f. 18 v , and were frequently imitated and parodied. Anonymous versions of No. 23 were copied from 40 in Wits Recreations 1641, X4-5 v (four stanzas), 1645, V8-X1 v (five stanzas), and Wit and Mirth: or , Pills to Purge Melancholy , 1699, F7 v -8 v , with a musical setting by Mr. Church; the late Brit. Lib. MS Add. 27407, f. 107 v , was copied from the 1645 Wits Recreations . Miss Crum refers to an anonymous eight-stanza parody, beginning "Like to a dove-cote never haunted," in Roxburghe Ballads , I, 208-209, stanzas 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 of which are variants of the five stanzas of No. 23. An anonymous version of No. 23 in Brit. Lib. MS Egerton 923 f. 1 omits stanza 3 and adds two new stanzas. In addition a version of the first four stanzas in Folger MS V. a. 303 f. 224 v -5, is subscribed "W. R." on the basis of which Miss Agnes Latham printed the Brit. Lib. MS Add. 27407 anonymous text in her Poems of Sir Walter Ralegh , 1952, pp. 165-170. Printed as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 493-499), listed under Ralegh by Beal (RaW 428-33), who adds St. John's College, Cambridge, S. 32 and National Library of Wales 12443A. These anonymous lines parodying the verses printed by Quarles in 1629 could not have been composed until several years after the deaths of both Ralegh and Beaumont. When we turn from the evidence for authorship to the texts themselves, we find that wherever other reliable texts are available for comparison those printed in 40 are usually found to be corrupt. Though No. 19 by Bishop King has only one error in its 12 lines and though No. 7 departs from its copy text O2 in only about one line out of ten, No. 10 by Sir John Beaumont is incomplete and varies from the authoritative text printed in his works in eight of its first 18 lines, Nos. 11 and 18 vary from the more authoritative texts of Henry Lawes in every other line, and No. 22, to be seen in a church only a few steps from Blaikelocke's shop, varies from Munday and Archbishop Sancroft's transcripts in five of its 18 lines. Corrupt texts are evidence of either careless copying or corrupt originals, both of which raise doubts about their attributions of authorship. Blaikelocke was solely responsible for the attribution of Nos. 2, 5, and 7 to Beaumont (there is no evidence that he knew of the existence of the Kent Archives or Bodleian manuscripts from which his own text differs markedly). He was irresponsible in editing his copy text and introduced many unauthoritative emendations. He added the initials F. B. to No. 2 to suggest Beaumont, and he changed the initials A. F. to J. F. under No. 5 to suggest Beaumont's collaborator John Fletcher, clear evidence of his intent to deceive. Wethered is solely responsible for the attribution of No. 8 to Beaumont, and we have no other direct evidence to test his reliability. Either Wethered or Blaikelocke, or both together, were responsible for the attributions of Nos. 9-19 and 22-23 to Beaumont. Only one of these (No. 9) is found elsewhere attributed to him. No. 10 is by Sir John Beaumont, Nos. 11 and 18 by Henry Harrington, No. 14 probably by John (or Joseph) Rutter, and No. 19 certainly by Henry King. No. 13 may have been deliberately omitted from the second edition of this collection in 1653; it and No. 17 circulated as anonymous in the printed or manuscript anthologies of the time. No. 22 is an epitaph on a lady who died seven years after Beaumont, and No. 23 is a parody of a poem that was composed after Beaumont's death. This leaves only the unique texts, Nos. 12, 15, and 16, unaccounted for; but considering the company they are in, we can have little if any faith in their being Beaumont's. Both Blaikelocke and Wethered were young men, newly out of their apprenticeships; they published their joint volume over a quarter of a century after Beaumont had stopped writing and could have had no opportunity of being acquainted with him or with any of his close associates, all of whom were dead by 1640. They made no real effort to collect the genuine poems of Beaumont that were available. Except for Salmacis and Hermaphroditus , at the time they issued their volume at least fourteen poems were circulating under Beaumont's name or initials, seven of them in print and the rest in a number of manuscripts. All but one of these they overlooked. The most charitable assumption that can be made about the conduct of Blaikelocke and Wethered in publishing The Remedie of Love and the following items in 40 is that they came into possession of a manuscript containing Nos. 8-21, one of which (No. 9) was ascribed to Beaumont and two of which (Nos. 20-21) were elegies upon him, and that they assumed the remaining poems were of Beaumont's authorship. This assumption would absolve Wethered at least of intent to deceive, but it would do nothing to increase our confidence in the authority of his attributions. For Nos. 2-6, the case of the changed initials of No. 5 still stands against Blaikelocke, and all confidence in him disappears when we examine the way he compiled his augmented edition of Beaumont's poems thirteen years later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1653 Volume. Almost at the end of his publishing career, Blaikelocke issued in 1653 an enlarged second edition of his 1640 volume. A variant title page lists William Hope as publisher, suggesting that he had contracted to take some of the sheets for sale at his own shop, so Blaikelocke was probably responsible for the entire contents of the book. 53 reprinted 22 of the 23 poems in 40 , and added 109 new items, all but two of which had been printed previously, many under the names of other authors. Four of these new items are commendatory poems; three are specifically ascribed to Thomas Randolph, J. Cleaveland, and Tho. Batt; 72 are attributed jointly to "Beaumont and Fletcher"; but the remaining thirty are presented as the work of Beaumont alone. Blaikelocke's sources for all of these 109 new items can be found, and in most cases even the specific printed editions he drew upon can be determined. Only four of these 109 new items are possibly Beaumont's. For analysis the 53 text may be divided into ten sections. I list the contents in order below, indicating the source for the text of each item or group of items and giving in parentheses the names of earlier scholars who first made identifications of authorship. All the specific textual sources, and the names of many of the authors, are here established for the first time. (1) A1-4 v , the title page and six preliminary poems (Nos. 1-6) reprinted from 40 . The wording of Blaikelocke's dedicatory poem remains the same, but the addressee is now Robert Parkhurst instead of Robert Ducie (Blaikelocke had in the intervening years betrayed his first patron to the Committee on Sequestration). No. 2 is subscribed F. B. and No. 5 J. F. as in 40 . (2) A4 v -8 v , four added poems commending Beaumont and Fletcher, reprinted directly from the 1647 Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher , E1-2 v and d1 r-v (hereafter abbreviated BF ). (3) B1-E8 v , a reprint of the remaining contents of 40 in the same order, except that No. 13 is omitted. (4) F1 r-v , two new poems, "Love is" and "A shepherdesse," ostensibly by Francis but actually by his brother John (Weber), the first poem complete but only the first six of the 80 lines of the second, copied verbatim from Sir John's Bosworth-field , 1629, H2-4 v . (5) F2-3 v , two previously unprinted poems. (a) "Since thou art dead, Clifton, the world may see." 64 lines in couplets headed "A Funerall Elogie on the Death of the Lady Penelope Clifton" and subscribed "F. B." Lady Penelope, the first child of Lady Penelope Rich by Sir Charles Blount (later earl of Devonshire), became the first wife of Sir Gervase Clifton (1586-1666), and died at the age of 23 on 26 October 1613. Francis's brother Sir John Beaumont and Michael Drayton also wrote elegies upon her, and Sir John named his son Gervase after her husband. Printed by Dyce (XI, 511-513 from 53 with collations from two manuscripts) and listed by Beal (BmF 87-95). Of the six manuscripts I have seen, three attribute the lines to Francis Beaumont (Bodl. Ashmole 781 p. 153, Brit. Lib. Add. 25303 f. 105, and Stowe 962 f. 139) and three are anonymous (Brit. Lib. Add. 21433 f. 175 v —because the following leaf containing the end of the poem is lacking, Harley 3910 f. 20, and Huntington HM 198 Part I p. 99). Beal does not indicate whether or not his added Nos. 93-95 are attributed. (b) "Stand still my happiness and swelling heart." 38 lines in couplets, headed "The examination of his Mistris Perfections" and subscribed "Fran. Beaumont." Reprinted as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 495-496) and listed by Beal (BmF 84-86). Untitled and subscribed "F. Bea:" in Bodl. Malone 13 (mid-late 17th) f. 3 r-v (omits lines 25-28). Anonymous in Brit. Lib. Add. 25707 f. 157 and Egerton 2725 f. 147. The texts are independent of one another. (6) F4-6 v , two related poems, "Sir or" headed "The Hermaphrodite made after M. Beaumonts Death by Thomas Randolph M. A. Sometime fellow of Trinity Colledge in Cambridge," and "Problems of" headed "Upon the Hermaphrodite written since by Mr. J. Cleaveland." The first of these had been printed in the posthumous second edition of Poems . . . By Thomas Randolph, M. A. and late Fellow of Trinity Col. in Cambridge , 1640, K3-4, headed "Upon an Hermaphrodite"; but the 53 text was taken from the fourth edition, 1652, K3-4, from which it varies in only one word and the correction of three obvious misprints in its 66 lines. Both poems were printed in the anonymous collection of John Cleveland's poems, The Character of a London-Diurnall: With severall select Poems. By the same Author , 1647, B2-3 (three editions), the first headed "Upon an Hermophodite" and the second headed "The Authors Hermophrodite, made after M. Randolphs death, yet inserted into his Poems." Both were reprinted with the same headings, but properly spelled, in Poems. By J. C. With Aditions , 1651, A6-7 v ; 53 's text of the second poem may have been taken from this edition, though it varies in five words of the 62 lines. The text of the second poem states that it is by the author of the first, so both must be by Cleveland. The two poems were probably included because their titles suggested to Blaikelocke a relationship to Salmacis and Hermaphroditus , but there is no evidence in the texts themselves that their author was acquainted with that work. (7) F6 v -G5 v , twelve poems, probably all, and certainly all but three, taken from printed editions of Waller, Cleveland, Randolph, Shirley, Donne, and Carew. (a—b) "Here Coelia" headed "To the Mutable Faire" without subscription and "Not caring" headed "Of Loving at first sight" subscribed "Tho. Batt." Both of these are by Edmund Waller (Dyce) and were printed with the same headings in his Poems , 1645, I4-6 and G1 r-v ; but Blaikelocke's texts vary from the print in five of the 68 lines of the first and two of the 20 lines of the second. (c) "For shame" headed "The Antiplatonick," actually by Cleveland (Weber) and printed with the same heading in his Poems , 1651, D4 r-v , from which Blaikelocke's text varies in only one word and three variant forms in its 48 lines. (d) "Say lovely" verbatim from Waller's Poems , 1645, E1 v -2. (e) "Behold the" by Waller (Dyce MS), taken with one verbal variant from his Poems , 1645, E2 v . (f) "Heaven knows" by Randolph (Nichols); Blaikelocke's text varies in seven words in its 38 lines from the fourth edition of Randolph's Poems , 1652, G4 v -5. (g) "While others" by Shirley (Nichols), verbatim except for two elisions from his Poems , 1646, F1. (h) "Now fie" by Shirley (Dyce), verbatim from his Poems , 1646, F6. (i) "Go and" by Donne (Weber), the first two stanzas only, verbatim from his Poems , 1633, Cc2 v , or 1635, 1639, 1649, or 1650. (j—l) "Fear not," "How ill," and "Let fools" by Carew (Dyce), taken with only one verbal variant from his Poems , 1651, A6 v , B8 r-v , and D1 v -2. (8) G6-L6 v , 74 items taken directly from BF (the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio), from which the four commendatory poems on A4 v -8 v above had also been copied. (a) G6-H1 v , "Stay light-foot," headed "A maske of the Gentlemen of Graies Inne, and the Inner Temple, by Mr Francis Beaumont," from *8D2 r-v of the Folio (noted by Fredson Bowers, The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , I (1966), 122). (b) H2-L5, "To please" etc. (72 items), headed "Prologues, Epilogues, and Songs to severall Plaies, written by Mr Francis Beaumont and Fletcher," selected from C4-*8D1 v of the Folio. None of these are by Beaumont, and many are not by Fletcher either. (c) L5 v -6 v , "The Sun which doth the greatest comfort bring," 82 lines in couplets headed "Mr Francis Beaumont's Letter to Ben Iohnson, written before he and Mr Fletcher came to London, with two of the precedent Comedies then not finished, which deferred their merry meetings at the Mermaid," directly from the 1647 Folio, 3X3 v -4, where it follows The Nice Valour . A superior text of this had been printed among "Poems . . . By other Gentlemen" in Poems: Written by Wil. Shake-speare Gent. , 1640, L4-5 (STC 22344), headed "To Ben. Iohnson" and subscribed "F. B." Printed by Dyce (XI, 500-503) from BF , and by Herford and Simpson, Ben Jonson , XI (1952), 374-377, from Trinity College Dublin 877 (G. 2. 21) ff. 144-145, with variants from BF and four other manuscripts. Of the 12 manuscripts I have seen, six attribute the lines to Beaumont by name (Bodl. Malone 13 p. 56; Brit. Lib. Egerton 2421 f. 27 v (headed "to D r Donne"), Sloane 1792 f. 85 v ; Huntington HM 198 Part I p. 128; St. John's College Cambridge 416 (S. 23) f. 49 v ; and Trinity College Dublin 877 (G. 2. 21) f. 207 v ); one by initials (Brit. Lib. Add. 30982 f. 79 v ); and five are anonymous (Bodl. Eng. poet. e. 97 f. 50; Harvard fMS Eng. 96.3 f. 31 v ; Huntington HM 172 f. 31 v , Huntington HM 198 Part II f. 115 v ; and Trinity College Dublin 877 f. 145. Beal does not indicate whether or not his added Nos. 105-107 112, and 116 are attributed. (9) L7-8 v , two poems on Beaumont's death reprinted from 40 , Nos. 20 and 21. (10) M1-N8, thirteen elegiac and convivial poems taken from three earlier prints. (a) M1-2 v , five epitaphs, on Shakespeare, Jonson (two), Spenser, and Drayton, and a sixth poem "On the Tombes in Westminster," taken directly from the 1650 edition of Wits Recreations , O4 v -5 and O8 v -P1. All the poems in Wits Recreations are anonymous; but since Shakespeare, Drayton, and Jonson all died after Beaumont he could not have written epitaphs on them. Norman Ault, Elizabethan Lyrics , 1925, pp. ix—x, first pointed out that the sixth poem, 18 lines beginning "Mortality behold and fear," first appeared in Wits Recreations , and that a 48-line version, which he printed, was in John Weever's Ancient Funeral Monuments , 1631, [Tt6 v -Vv1] and was not by Beaumont. He also noted anonymous texts in two later manuscripts, Bodl. Ashmole 38 and Brit. Lib. Add. 18044. Later ( TLS , 12 January 1933, p. 24) he showed that the 48-line version first appeared in W. B. and E. P.'s A Helpe to Discourse , 1619 (STC 1547), and suggested that its author may have been William Basse. Printed from 53 as doubtful by Dyce (XI, 497), but Beal followed Ault in rejecting it (p. 67) and added manuscript versions in Bodl. Eng. poet. f. 27 pp. 337-339, Folger V. a. 275 p. 85, and Yale Osborn b 226 p. 90. The poem, which is not Beaumont's, is the only one that appears under his name in most recent anthologies. The 53 text was printed as Beaumont's in Palgrave's Golden Treasury , 1861, Ward's English Poets , 1880 (where it was highly praised by A. C. Bradley), and in Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of English Verse , 1900. Helen Gardner, The New Oxford Book of English Verse , 1972, followed Ault in printing the 48-line version, though she probably rightly rejected his attribution to Basse, but wrongly persisted in attributing it to Beaumont. (b) M3-8 "Not drunken" headed "The Ex-Ale-tation of Ale," 70 four-line stanzas. This was entered by Richard Badger on 22 Une 1629 (Rollins, Index of Ballad Entries , No. 278), but the earliest extant complete edition is an anonymous one published by T. Badger in 1646 (Wing M 1952) with 71 stanzas but many verbal errors. The 53 text was probably taken from an earlier edition, now lost. Mr. Thomas Davis called to my attention a 34-stanza version published in 1642 (Wing R 239A) as by Thomas Randall (i.e. Randolph). In 1661 the 53 text was reprinted without indication of author as the first item in N. D.'s anthology, An Antidote Against Melancholy , B1-4 v . In 1711 Thomas Hearne noted, "'tis said the Author was Dr. Peter Mews, Bp. of Winchester" ( Remarks and Collections , ed. C. E. Doble, III [1899], 219). (c) M8 v -N6 v , five convivial poems taken directly from the 1650 edition of Wits Recreations , Z8 v -Aa7 v . The first of these, "When shall," may be by Thomas Randolph (see Herford and Simpson, Ben Jonson , VIII, 449); the second, "Fetch me," was printed from a different source in An Antidote Against Melancholy , 1661, I1-2, where it is attributed to Dr. Hen. Edwards (a reference to King Charles in line 80 shows that it was composed after Beaumont's death). (d) N7-8, "Happy is" headed "The praises of a Country Life," by Ben Jonson (Dyce MS); taken with only two verbal variants in its 70 lines from "Under-woods" (No. 85) in the second volume of The Workes of Benjamin Jonson , 1640, Nn1-2. Only two of the 109 new items in 53 ("Since thou" and "Stand still" F2-3 v ) were previously unprinted, and of the previously printed items only A maske of the Gentlemen of Graies Inne, and the Inner Temple , G6-H1 v , and Mr Francis Beaumont's Letter to Ben Iohnson , "The sun" L5 v -6 v , were attributed to Beaumont in the earlier editions. Five of Blaikelocke's other texts ("Problems of" by Cleveland, "Here Coelia" and "Not caring" by Waller, "Heaven knows" by Randolph, and "Not drunken" by Randolph or Mews) contain a small number of variants from the extant prints, which might indicate derivation from otherwise unknown manuscript or printed intermediaries. All the rest of Blaikelocke's texts were taken almost verbatim from specifically identifiable printed editions of poems by Sir John Beaumont, Thomas Carew, John Cleveland, John Donne, Ben Jonson, Thomas Randolph, James Shirley, Edmund Waller, the Beaumont and Fletcher 1647 Folio, and the 1650 edition of Wits Recreations . It may have been possible to maintain some doubt about Blaikelocke's culpability in attributing the items in 40 to Beaumont, but there can be no doubt of his deliberate dishonesty in attributing to him the new items in 53 . In the latter volume Blaikelocke not only attributed to Beaumont poems that he knew were by known popular poets of the second quarter of the seventeenth century, but he also reprinted without authorization texts that were the property of other publishers. The conclusion is inescapable that no poem in 40 or 53 can be accepted as Beaumont's on the authority of Blaikelocke or Wethered alone. Doubts concerning the authenticity of the attributions in the 40 and 53 volumes were expressed early. Probably soon after its publication, the musician Henry Lawes presented a copy of 40 (now in the Huntington Library) to his patron the Earl of Bridhewater, in which under Nos. 11 and 18 he wrote, "made by Henry Harrington and set by Henry Lawes, 1636." Another seventeenth-century owner of a copy of 40 (Bodleian Ashmole 1663), John Aubrey, wrote on A2 v under Blaikelocke's name: a Raskal and a Cuckold (by the Templers) and one of the Informers to the Committees of Sequestration at Haberdashers-hall and Gold smiths-hall: and I being at the former, attending the taking off of my Fathers Sequestration I ouer heard this Blaick-lock give notice of this Sir Robert Ducy's being in London (in cognito) and discouered his Lodgeing. He dyed a Beggar and (I thinke) in the Kings-Bench-prison. I have a strong Conceit, that the most Ingenius Mr. Fr. Beaumont, was not the Author of these Poemes: b[ut] the Booke sellers are cheating knaves. Even William Hope, who took some of the sheets of 53 from Blaikelocke for sale under his own imprint, had his doubts about the attributions, and when he reissued the remainder sheets of 53 in 1660 he printed a new title page which described the contents somewhat more honestly as The Golden Remains of . . . Francis Beaumont &amp; John Fletcher . . . enriched with the addition of other Drolleries by severall Wits of these present Times . It is a serious matter to deprive an author of credit for works that may be rightfully his, but it is just as damaging to attribute to him works for which he had no responsibility. After a poem that he had had nothing to do with had been published under his name, Abraham Cowley commented; From this which had hapned to my self, I began to reflect upon the fortune of almost all Writers, and especially Poets, whose Works (commonly printed after their deaths) we finde stuffed out, either with counterfeit pieces, like false Money put in to fill up the Bag, though it adds nothing to the sum; or with such, which though of their own Coyn, they would have called in themselves, for the baseness of the Allay: whether this proceed from the indiscretion of their Friends, who think a vast heap of Stones or Rubbish a better Monument, then a little Tomb of Marble, or by the unworthy avarice of some Stationers, who are content to diminish the value of the Author, so they may encrease the price of the Book; and like Vintners with sophisticate mixtures, spoil the whole vessel of wine, to make it yield more profit. ( Poems , 1656, a1 v -2). The same fortune befell Beaumont, whose popular name was irresponsibly used by dishonest publishers merely for the purpose of promoting the sale of their own wares. The evidence here presented makes it clear that we should not accept any of Blaikelocke or Wethered's attributions unless they are substantiated from other sources. On this basis, we must reject from the Beaumont canon all poems in 40 except 2, 6, 7, and 9, and all items added in 53 except The Maske of the Inner Temple and Grayes Inne (G6-H1 v , reprinted from the 1547 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio). "Since thou," "Stand still," and "The sun" (it is worth notice that these four are the only items independently signed with Beaumont's name or initials in 53 ). This leaves to Beaumont only eight of the 132 items in the combined volumes, and of these eight only four can be accepted as his with any confidence. The attribution of Nos. 2, 6, and 7 in 40 ( Salmacis and Hermaphroditus with two preliminary poems) is supported only by the unknown scribe who many years after Beaumont's death added his name to texts he copied from the anonymous O2 , and the attribution of "Stand still" in 53 (F3 r-v ) is supported only by a single unknown scribe of the second half of the seventeenth century who subscribed his defective copy "F Beo". These four must be labelled doubtful at best. So this leaves us, aside from The Maske , with only one poem probably Beaumont's in 40 (No. 9, "As unthrifts," Dyce XI, 503-505), and with only two in 53 : the elegy on Lady Clifton ("Since thou," F2-3, Dyce, XI, 511-513), and the letter to Ben Jonson ("The sun," L5 v -6 v , Dyce XI, 500-503). To these three we may add the four commendatory poems to Fletcher and Jonson (Dyce II, 8-10 and XI, 497-499), the two poems on Lady Rutland (Dyce XI, 505-511), and one of the three poems added by Beal, "Good Madam Fowler" (BmF 117-132, printed by Grosart in Englische Studien , 1899), a total of only ten in the probable canon. What is certain is that 40 and 53 are anthologies containing poems by a number of seventeenth-century authors. They therefore deserve a place in a future second edition of Arthur E. Case's Bibliography of English Poetical Miscellanies , but they do not deserve a place in bibliographies of collected poems by Francis Beaumont.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Until the publication of William B. Todd's "A Bibliographical Account of The Gentleman's Magazine , 1731-1754" in Studies in Bibliography (18 [1965], 81-109), the bibliographical history of the first magazine was "entirely conjectural, with all editions undefined, early printings unlocated, piracies and counterfeits undetected and—excepting . . . the work of a few Johnsonians—all textual revision completely unnoticed" (p. 81). In the course of his investigations Todd examined, or had examined for him, 175 sets of 24 annual volumes, which, including various supplements, total 312 separate numbers, some printed as many as nine times, with differing textual states occurring in every set. The bibliographical evidence, as might be expected, is extensive and complex. Although Todd was aware that a number of the Gentleman's Magazine might be only "partially revised and reset" (p. 85), in a project of this scope it would be difficult to collate every gathering. 1 In order to differentiate the printings Todd relied on the order of the eight woodcuts of St. John's Gate used on the title pages of the original editions from September 1731 through June 1790 and the order of the imprints, supplemented by a record of the last entry to the left and right of the woodcut, the type of ornamental block heading the first page of text, and the signature position on the first signed page. 2 Since many of Samuel Johnson's early prose writings, including the "Debates in the Senate of Magna Lilliputia" or Parliamentary Debates , appear in the Gentleman's Magazine , it is important that the scholar be able to distinguish printings. In the process of preparing an edition of Johnson's shorter prose writings I have had numerous occasions to consult Todd's essay and have found it a reliable guide. When editing the text of the life of Sir Francis Drake which appeared in the August, September, October, December 1740, and January 1741 numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine , I was alerted to the reprinting of the January 1741 number in May or June 1742 by Todd's essay (p. 100). A collation of the two printings indicates that there are forty-five variant readings. Since these changes were made when Johnson was closely involved in the editorship of the Gentleman's Magazine , it is tempting to attribute them to him, although many seem unnecessary and a number of errors are introduced. One almost inexplicable revision is the change of "the Coast of America " to "this Coast" in "they . . . took a Ship laden with Silk and Linen, which was the last that they met with on the Coast of America " (38.b.56-60). 3 Perhaps it was felt that since Drake had been on the coast of America for the last two installments, the reader need not be reminded. When Drake lands on the coast of California he takes "Possession of it in the name of Queen Elizabeth , not without ardent Wishes that this Acquisition might have been of Use to his native Country, and that so mild and innocent a People might have been united to the Church of Christ" (40.a.58-40.b.2). The second printing improves both occurrences of "have been" to "be." In another instance a long sentence held together by "and"s is broken into two sentences (40.a.2). The most important correction, however, is the addition of a footnote: "An Account which we have seen since the first Impression for this Month, says, most of these Spanish Ships were unmann'd." At the beginning of this final installment of the Life of Drake , Johnson has described Drake's arrival in Lima where he "entered the Harbour without Resistance, though thirty Ships were stationed there, of which seventeen were equipp'd for their Voyage, and many of them are represented in the Narrative as Vessels of considerable force" (38.a.2-7). The phrase "in the Narrative" immediately suggests that Johnson is sceptical and wants to shift the authority for this statement to his source, The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake , edited by Drake's nephew and namesake, Sir Francis Drake Bart., to glorify himself and his family. 4 As might be expected, Johnson inserts a commentary: their Security seems to have consisted not in their Strength, but in their Reputation, which had so intimidated the Spaniards , that the Sight of their own Superiority could not rouse them to Opposition. Instances of such panic Terrours are to be met with in other Relations, but as they are, for the most Part, quickly dissipated by Reason and Reflection, a wise Commander will rarely found his Hopes of Success on them; and, perhaps, on this Occasion, the Spaniards scarcely deserve a severer Censure for their Cowardice, than Drake for his Temerity (38.a.8-38.b.1-7). That Drake, with only one ship, could enter a harbor with thirty ships, seventeen "full ready," as the source describes them, was not to be believed, although it must be said in the narrator's favor that Johnson omits this was done at night. The "Instances of such panic Terrours" he apparently remembered from earlier reading as he did not examine other relations to find if they gave a different version of the taking of Lima harbor. This episode must have continued to bother him since in the spring of 1742 he added the footnote at "Temerity." Johnson may have had an occasion to consult some edition of either Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations or William Camden's Annals , sources he had drawn upon for Drake's early life, where he would have discovered that the number of the ships was twelve, that the tacking and arms had been taken ashore, that not so much as a boy had been left aboard, because the Spanish had no reason to expect an attack on the Pacific shore. 5 Perhaps he saw an account based on one or both of these sources in an unidentified periodical or pamphlet. The point is that this valuable insight into the working of Johnson's mind might have been lost without the skills of an analytical bibliographer. In fact, until the appearance of my edition of the collected shorter prose writings, the only text of the Life of Drake where the footnote can be found is in this second printing of the Gentleman's Magazine . The Life of Drake was reprinted in 1767, in a volume published by "Henry and Cave" which also contains reprints of the Life of Savage and the Life of Blake . In the portion of the Life of Drake containing the Gentleman's Magazine January 1741 installment, the 1767 edition follows the second rather than the first printing, but omits the footnote. 6 In 1773, however, Thomas Davies, reprinting the Life of Drake without authorization in his Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces , reverted to the Gentleman's Magazine , with the first printing of the final installment. As a result, the work of the 1767 editor, who did more than any of his successors to try to rectify the mistakes and puzzles of the original text, was lost, along with the footnote, since Davies's text of the Life (and of a good deal else in the Johnson prose canon) seems to have been the basis for that in the 1787 Works and later eighteenth-and nineteenth-century collections. The examination of only the title page and the place of the signature on the first signed page of each number of the Gentleman's Magazine is certain to leave some anomalies undetected. The Life of Drake began appearing in the August 1740 number of the Gentleman's Magazine and this opening installment fills all but the last column of a separate gathering, numbered '4.' Curiously, this gathering breaks into the text of an article reprinted from Common Sense , interrupting it at the end of the last page (388) of the previous gathering; the essay continues on the first page (397) of the next. At the foot of page 397 is the notice, "N. B. This Page is to read [ sic ] next to P. 388." The first installment of the Life of Drake thus appears to be a last-minute addition to this number. Perhaps Johnson's habitual dilatoriness had made Edward Cave despair of keeping the promise made to his readers in the July number, and he was able to fulfill it only by doing violence to the make-up of the magazine. This clue to Johnson's work habits can be discovered only by a bibliographical examination of the earliest printing of the Life of Drake . The Life of Blake first appeared in the June 1740 number of the Gentleman's Magazine and fills all but one page of an eight-page gathering, but the evidence presented by Todd provides no clue that this gathering exists in two typesettings with thirty-three variant readings. The immediate occasion of the publication of the life of Robert Blake (1598-1657), Oliver Cromwell's victorious admiral, was the failure of Robert Walpole's administration to pursue the War of Jenkins's Ear, thus allowing the Spanish to continue to prey on English shipping. As the introductory paragraph makes clear, Johnson intended to gain public support for the war by a comparison of the glorious past of the English navy with its present state. The strategy appears to have been successful, for in the following month Johnson announced that "Having the Satisfaction to find that the Account of Admiral Blake in our last Magazine was not disagreeable to the Publick, we propose in our next to entertain our Readers with the Life and Actions of Sir Francis Drake." 7 In fact the Life of Blake was successful enough that Cave issued it as a separate pamphlet sometime later in the year. The pamphlet, set from the first printing of the Gentleman's Magazine , corrects a few typographical errors but introduces more than a dozen textual corruptions. When at some undisclosed time it became necessary to reset the gathering containing the Life of Blake for the Gentleman's Magazine the first GM printing again served as printer's copy. The first printing of the Life of Blake appears in most sets of the Gentleman's Magazine ; the reset gathering, undoubtedly a smaller press run, I have discovered only in the Huntington Library copy. 8 Since all copies of the June 1740 number, no matter which printing of the life they contain, correspond to the first edition described by Todd (p. 105), only a careful examination of this gathering in multiple copies will discover the second printing. The Life of Blake fills seven of the eight pages of the fifth full gathering of the number. It is numbered '5' and signed 'Pp'. The signature positions are as follows: (1) Rive r , s ent (2) River,∧ s e nt. The different placements of the signature on the first, and only, signed leaf of the gathering alert the bibliographer that there are two impressions, if not two editions. The compositor, of course, was resetting the text line for line so that at first glance the two printings appear similar. But a typographical peculiarity makes it readily clear that these are two separate typesettings. The first printing uses abbreviations such as 'y' to represent the Old English thorn with an 'e' over it for 'the' and a 't' over it for 'that,' a 'w' with 'th' over it for 'with' and 'ch' over it for 'which.' These abbreviations appear seven times in the first printing but disappear in the second. As early as 1683-84 Joseph Moxon stated that these abbreviations "have been used by Printers in Old Times, to Shorten or Get in Matter ; but now are wholly left off as obsolete." 9 Yet they were still in use in the Gentleman's Magazine throughout 1740, gradually dwindling in number after that until August 1741 when they seem to disappear altogether. 10 Priority must be given, then, to the printing with abbreviations since it shares common typographical features with the rest of the June 1740 number—there are at least fifteen similar abbreviations in other articles—and other numbers in the 1740 volume. Additional evidence for establishing the priority of the printings is provided by the textual variants. As might be expected from such a reprinting, many of the changes are in punctuation and spelling, with a sprinkling of new typographical errors. But there are two revisions and one correction which indicate editorial intervention, almost certainly by Johnson since it is hard to imagine who else would take such an interest in the life. That Johnson should make so few revisions will come as no surprise to those familiar with his method. Given time and interest Johnson could make substantial revisions, usually in the direction of clarity in expression, as he does, for example, in the Rambler and Rasselas . But he was also capable of a kind of desultory carefulness, as when he inserts only one word in the pamphlet version of his An Account of the Life of John Philip Barretier (1744) 11 or corrects the final installment of the Life of Drake with a few stylistic improvements and the addition of one footnote. The first printing of the Life of Blake states that "In March , 1666, having forced Algiers to Submission, he entered the Harbour of Tunis " (305.b.61). This is clearly a mistake since Blake died in 1657. The problem begins with a typographical error in Johnson's source. Although Johnson refers to many sources, he is in fact drawing all of his information from the double-structured text and notes of Thomas Birch's article on Blake in volume three of the General Dictionary (1735). Johnson's source erroneously gives the date as March "1665" instead of "1655." Johnson either copied out "1666" for "1665" or the compositor introduced the error. When going back over the text Johnson saw that the chronology was wrong and changed the date to "1656" for the second printing. Since in the preceding paragraph Johnson gives " November , 1654" as the date Cromwell sent Blake into the Mediterranean, a more careful reading would have told him the March date should be the year following—1655. Johnson, who had used only one source for the life in the first instance, was not moved in the second to corroborate a date by consulting other sources. 12 The second revision is a stylistic improvement. The earliest printing read, " the bravest Man is not always in the most Danger " (303.a.35); " most " has been changed in the later printing to " greatest " to make it parallel with " bravest " and to give it a more epigrammatic quality. The third revision clears up a confusion in the text. Johnson opens a paragraph by describing the English taking "the Rear Admiral and another Vessel" before turning to the Dutch Admirals, de Ruyter and de Witt's, reaction to this loss. With "Admiral" referring to both ships and men in the first sentence, the clause "that two were taken" in the next sentence gives rise to some confusion as to whether "two" refers to ships or to men. This is clarified by the addition of "Ships": "that two Ships were taken" (303.b.26). Unlike Johnson's revisions for the Life of Drake , those for the Life of Blake were incorporated into later editions, probably because Thomas Davies unaccountably omitted it from his Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces which served as a basis for the 1787 Works . 13 The pamphlet version set from the first printing in the Gentleman's Magazine proved to be a textual deadend since reprintings in the London Chronicle , 13-20 August 1757, and in the 1767 volume containing the Life of Savage and the Life of Drake return to the earliest printing in the Gentleman's Magazine . Unable to find the Life of Blake in the Davies volume, the editor of the 1787 Works turned to the Gentleman's Magazine and reproduced the second GM printing. Subsequent eighteenth- and nineteenth-century editions used this text. No need for congratulations here, since they also incorporate many of the errors, and later reprintings have added to this number. Before December 1740 Johnson contributed little to the Gentleman's Magazine other than the lives of Blake and Drake, but beginning with this final number of the year his activity is intense until mid-1742, after which time he mostly contributed the debates. 14 I see no reason to doubt that it was Johnson who did the editorial tinkering for the reprinting of the Life of Drake in May or June 1742. Although the reprinting of the Life of Blake cannot be precisely dated, it is highly probable that Johnson revised it during the same period of editorial activity. Why this single sheet was reprinted is a mystery. Perhaps copies of this sheet were damaged or printed in an insufficient number and were reprinted to meet the demand for back numbers. 15 "Whatever its extent, no list of points will encompass every contingency," Todd reminds us. Users of the Gentleman's Magazine are warned that while Todd's essay provides a good point of departure, it is necessary to examine multiple copies of the gathering in which their text appears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Each number of the Gentleman's Magazine was normally issued in seven half sheets, or 56 pages. Some rough arithmetic suggests that there might be as many as 382,000 gatherings (175 x 312 x 7). 2 Todd has reported his methods for distinguishing printings of periodicals in several essays. See "The Printing of Eighteenth-Century Periodicals: With notes on The Examiner and The World ," Library , 5th ser., 10 (1955), 49-54 and "Early Editions of The Tatler ," Studies in Bibliography , 15 (1962), 121-133. 3 References to the Gentleman's Magazine are by page, column, and line number. 4 The World Encompassed was first published in 1628, but Johnson used an edition reprinted, with three other early accounts of Drake's voyages, for Nicholas Bourne in 1652-1653. For a detailed discussion of Johnson's use of these sources, see O M Brack, Jr., "The Making of the Life of Drake " (forthcoming). 5 See, for example, Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations , 2nd ed. (1598-1600), 3: 735 and Camden's Annals (1635), p. 222. 6 The 1767 volume was reissued by F. Newbery with a cancel-title in 1769 and 1775, and then reprinted in 1777. Given the St. John's Gate address, one would like to think that the substantive changes in the 1767 edition were made by Johnson, or with his authority. But Clarence Tracy's comments on the editorial work in the 1767 Life of Savage apply here: "Many of the changes . . . like the removal of a hypergrammatical 'If' . . . might have been made by any competent compositor, others are 'improvements' that Johnson probably would not have relished, and a few downright blunders." See his edition of the Life of Savage (1971), p. xxxi. 7 See the Gentleman's Magazine , 10 (July 1740), 352. 8 For purposes of comparison I have also examined carefully the following copies: AzTeS, CLSU, CtY (Beinecke, Sterling copy 2), TxHR, British Library (North Library), Bodleian (A7.5010), Herman W. Liebert. I have searched numerous copies for another example of the second printing of the Life of Blake and would welcome reports. 9 Mechanic Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , ed. Herbert Davis and Harry Carter (1962), pp. 332-333. 10 Todd fails to note these abbreviations which provide a small clue to later printings. At best they indicate that an early number with no abbreviations probably was not printed before mid-1741 but it cannot be dated exactly without the additional evidence provided by Todd. It is worth noting that the two abbreviations in the January 1741 installment of the Life of Drake are expanded in the second printing. 11 In a copy of the pamphlet now in the Glasgow University Library the word "whole" is inserted in Johnson's handwriting in the clause "he spent whole days among his books" (p. 26, 1. 2). See J. D. Fleeman, A Preliminary Handlist of Copies of Books Associated with Dr. Samuel Johnson (1984), no. 102. See also nos. 121 and 140. 12 Although the Life of Drake is based primarily on the four pamphlets printed for Nicholas Bourne, Johnson examines other sources for Drake's early life and corroborates information when he is suspicious of his principal source. In the Life of Blake , as in the lives of Paul Sarpi, Herman Boerhaave, Peter Burman, and Thomas Sydenham, he was content to draw upon one source, filling it out with his own commentary. 13 The anonymous reviewer of Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces in the Gentleman's Magazine (44 [Nov. 1774], 525), who shows familiarity with Johnson's canon, observes, "Why the life of Admiral Blake, by the same hand, is omitted, we are at a loss to know." 14 See Thomas Kaminski, The Early Career of Samuel Johnson (forthcoming), chap. 8. 15 The Life of Blake fills seven pages of an eight-page gathering, the final page (308) containing the beginning of the "Poetical Essays" for the month. There are no changes in the three undistinguished poems which would account for the reprinting.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Provincial Bookselling in Eighteenth-Century England: The Case of John Clay Reconsidered by Jan Fergus and Ruth Portner</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a recent article, "John Clay of Daventry: the business of an eighteenth-century stationer" ( Studies in Bibliography 37 [1984]: 198-209), John Feather analyzed some of the voluminous business records of John Clay and his sons, booksellers in Daventry, Rugby, Lutterworth, and Warwick at various times between the 1740's and the 1780's. One of Feather's major conclusions is that the business of a provincial bookseller like Clay depended on sales of stationery far more than on sales of books and other printed matter. A related conclusion is that, "apart from schoolbooks . . . and part books and magazines, his book trade was chiefly in chapbooks and ballads" (p. 205). If correct, these conclusions would have serious implications for the study of the provincial book trade and of provincial readership as well. If sales of stationery were of much greater importance in volume and profit than sales of books, then provincial stationers would have had little incentive to develop the bookselling portion of their trade. If provincial readers could be generally satisfied with schoolbooks, part books, and magazines printed in London, along with chapbooks and ballads from "local sources" (p. 205), then they were largely cut off from the cultural life represented by the hundreds of books published every year in London. 1 The London book trade, consequently, would have had little reason to consider provincial readers in calculating what to publish, how many copies to print, and where to distribute them, and provincial booksellers would have had correspondingly little inclination to arrange for frequent orders and deliveries of books from London. In other words, the division between "town" and "country" in eighteenth-century England would be quite as severe culturally as it often was politically and socially, if Feather is right in attributing so small a volume and proportion of book sales to a bookseller whose main shop, in Daventry, was located only seventy-two miles from London by contemporary roads. Feather's conclusions are mistaken, however. The mistakes arise primarily from his misreading of the records, especially of one day book analyzed in his study, and secondarily from his methodology. A more accurate investigation of the Clay business records reveals that, if the Clay records are at all representative, then the provincial book trade and provincial culture were in a very lively and flourishing state between 1746 and 1780. 2 In his article, Feather tabulated the business transactions recorded in day books by John Clay in October, 1768 (Northamptonshire Record Office [hereafter NRO] D2925) and by his son Thomas in October, 1778 (NRO D2926). He has, however, misidentified the first of these day books. Eighteenth-century shopkeepers like the Clays used day books to record every day's credit transactions, as well as orders for items not in stock. The Clays kept both ledger accounts and day books. Once a month or so, all credit purchases listed in the day book but not yet paid were posted to each individual customer's account in a ledger. Day books were thus organized by date, ledgers by customers' names. Feather takes day book D2925 to be a record of transactions at the Clays' main shop in Daventry. But it does not record Daventry transactions; it is a record of purchases made at their small market shop in Rugby. The evidence for considering D2925 a Rugby day book is so overwhelming that we can include only the most telling arguments here. First, evidence external to the day book indicates its use in Rugby. The customers and the transactions entered in D2925 correspond almost perfectly with those recorded in John Clay's ledger for Rugby, NRO ML691 (1764-74). The latter is one of a continuous series of four ledgers which list the credit purchases of individual boys and masters at Rugby School between 1744-88 (see Table 1). 3 In fact, these four ledgers represent the only surviving bookselling ledgers in all the Clay records. Two of them are clearly labelled Rugby records: D3412 has "Rugby July 1744" on the front cover; D2932 likewise has "Rugby" on the cover and also "Rugby Ledger" in faded letters on the spine. Even without such labels, however, the ledgers' application to customers at Rugby school would be evident. The boys' and masters' names in NRO ML691, for example, together with the dates of their purchases, correspond to the names and dates of entrance recorded in The Rugby School Register for this period. 4 Thus, John Clay noted in day book D2925 that "Mr. Watts at ye School" bought the two-shilling "Compleat Lr. Writer" on credit on October 15, 1768, and later posted this transaction to the Watts account in ledger ML691, p. 76, as "1 Complete Letter Writer" bought for two shillings on October 15, 1768. Moreover, the Rugby School Register indicates that a Thomas Watts entered Rugby in 1768. Most of the transactions in D2925 found their way to ML691 in this fashion, and most of the customers can be identified by reference to the Rugby School Register . The remaining entries in D2925 generally consist of credit transactions made by other residents of Rugby and its surrounding parishes. These residents can be identified in Warwickshire parish records and in other documents as well. The second argument depends upon internal evidence. Transactions are generally entered in D2925 only at weekly intervals: several orders on October 1, 1768, several on October 8, on October 15, and so forth. These dates fell on successive Saturdays in 1768, and Rugby held its market day on Saturday. 5 The Rugby shop, in fact, like the Lutterworth shop, was peripheral to the main shop in Daventry. Although some evidence exists that assistants may have kept the Rugby and Lutterworth shops open for cash sales during the week, generally John Clay visited these shops to take orders once or twice a week, on the market day and sometimes another day as well. In addition, Clay kept a horse to ride the eleven miles from Daventry to Rugby or the seventeen miles from Daventry to Lutterworth, and these long rides made a small, portable day book very desirable. 6 Both D2925 and D2926 are quite small. The Rugby book, D2925, is about six inches wide and eight inches high. The Lutterworth book, D2926, is even smaller: less than five inches wide and seven and a quarter inches high. Both day books were equipped with a flap and strings so that they could be sealed against the weather. They were thus quite convenient for travelling. By contrast, the Daventry day books have no flaps or strings and are about twice as large: they all measure approximately six by sixteen inches. Such combinations of internal and external evidence have made it possible to identify the surviving records listed in Table 1 with some confidence. 7 Feather's error in assigning day book D2925 to Daventry probably stems from the entry in John Clay's handwriting on the endleaf: "John Clay Bookseller | at Daventry—Northamptonshire." It is, however, much more likely that such clear identification would be made in a book destined to travel to a shop in another town and county rather than in one confined to the main shop. In fact, the surviving Daventry day books lack any identification at all. Feather's misidentification of D2925, coupled with his decision to tabulate the transactions of only two months, means that he has drawn conclusions from skewed data. First, the misidentification causes him to omit all Daventry records from his analysis. John Clay and later his son Thomas Clay lived in Daventry and kept the shop open six days a week, not one or two as in Rugby or Lutterworth. Daventry was also a considerably larger town than the others: it had a population of 2,582 in the 1801 census, compared to 1,487 in Rugby and 1,652 in Lutterworth. 8 As a consequence of such differences, the records of any month's business in Daventry include far more transactions from a wider variety of customers than do the records of a comparable month in either the Rugby or Lutterworth shops. Indeed, as Table 2.1 shows, the Daventry day books record sales of £51.13.8 for October, 1747, and a very comparable figure for October, 1779, over thirty years later: £57.7.8½. Each of these figures amounts to more than double the sales tabulated by Feather: £18.19.7 for October, 1768, in Rugby, and £16.19.10½ for October, 1778, in Lutterworth (reproduced in Tables 3.1 and 3.2). His figures, however, include charges for stamp duty on both "skins" (parchment for legal documents) and paper. Since such charges tend to be quite large and to vary a good deal in quantity from month to month, they are likely to distort the monthly figures. We have therefore excluded them from our own totals although we have indicated them separately. Accordingly, Table 2.1 shows that stamp duty adds another £21.8.3 to the October 1747 figures and £20.4.0 to those for October 1779. In our own calculations, at least £8.19.6 of the sales recorded in October 1768 (Rugby) and £7.8.0 of those in October 1778 (Lutterworth) represent the cost of the stamps themselves. By excluding such costs, we have arrived at total sales of £11.6.10 in Rugby and £11.11.6 in Lutterworth for the months investigated by Feather—each about one-fifth the sales in Daventry for October 1747 and 1779 (see Tables 3.1 and 3.2). 9 All these figures confirm the centrality of the Daventry shop to the Clays' business and document a far healthier income for the Clays than Feather indicates. Table 2 also suggests the major problem in Feather's methodology: to draw conclusions from isolated months is likely to produce misleading results. Feather's major errors—the conclusions that Clay was primarily a stationer and that his book trade was principally in schoolbooks, part books, chapbooks, and ballads—arise in part from his willingness to consider the two months he chose to investigate as representative. In fact, as Table 2.1 indicates, no "typical" month can be identified. In December of both 1747 and 1779, for example, sales were poor compared to the October figures: in 1747, sales in December amounted to little more than half those for October, and in 1779, December sales came to about 65% of October's. By contrast, December was the busiest month in the last quarter of 1746, with sales of £47.10.7 compared to £24.18.12 in October of that year. The stamp duties collected in 1746 reflect this discrepancy: £10.17.0 was collected in December, compared to only 4s6d in October. The large sales figure for December 1746, however, is itself somewhat skewed: one customer, a Mr. Brice of Leicester, was responsible for ordering £17.5.6 worth of stationery during that month. These large orders are at once quite common and quite unpredictable. In short, it is not possible to arrive at a "'normal' month's sales" by ignoring large orders, as Feather does (p. 202). It is equally impossible to analyze "two typical months," as Feather claims to have done, simply because a normal or typical month cannot be reliably established without extensive computer-based analysis of the voluminous records. In the absence of such analysis, we have compiled information in Table 2.1 about sales in Daventry from October through December of the first two years available in the records—1746 and 1747, with John Clay as proprietor—and for the same three-month period in 1779, the last such period recorded in Daventry, when the shop was operated by Thomas Clay. With liberal doses of caution, some interesting preliminary conclusions can be drawn from the information compiled in this table. Generally, these conclusions contradict those of Feather. First of all, bookselling—including sales of all printed matter—was clearly extremely important throughout the period covered by the Clay records, particularly in Daventry. The Daventry day books do not support Feather's conclusion that "primarily, Clay was a stationer, dealing in paper and printed forms" (p. 202) or that bookselling "in these small market towns, was economically of far less importance" than sales of stationery goods (p. 204). John Clay was a bookseller who sold stationery, not the reverse; so was his son Thomas, although sales of stamps and stationery may have been somewhat more central to his business than to John's. In any case, both seem to have sent weekly book orders to London to various dealers, and apparently had little trouble in obtaining most books that their customers wanted. Partly as a result of their efficient arrangements to obtain deliveries from London, sales of books and other printed matter in Daventry came to nearly £48 in the last three months of 1746, nearly £84 for the comparable period in 1747, and just over £90 for that in 1779; these figures represent about 50%, 70%, and 58% respectively of total sales—excluding charges for stamp duty—for the threemonth periods (Table 2.1). If stamp duty is included, then sales of print come to 42%, 56%, and 40% of total sales in Daventry during the same period, by far the largest proportion of the sales. Thus, a fairly high demand for printed matter seems to have persisted in Daventry. Selling books and other publications clearly remained the most substantial and important part of the credit portion of the business while the Clays were operating. Admittedly, sales of printed matter in Lutterworth and Rugby were smaller in both volume and proportion, but not as much so as Feather suggests. His figures assign about one-third of the sales in Rugby and Lutterworth to bookselling. Our own sampling suggests that the monthly totals for the peripheral shops varied, with sales of books and other printed matter accounting for one-third to one-half of each month's credit receipts, excluding stamp duty (see Table 3.1 and 3.2). Furthermore, a number of customers at both Rugby and Lutterworth were very eager to buy books and pamphlets, not merely part books, schoolbooks and chapbooks; Mr. Grundy, for example, a dissenting minister at Lutterworth, bought more than fifty publications between July 1776 and February 1781. An important qualification to these figures must be noted here. The day books do not tell the whole story of the Clays' trade in their shops. They omit nearly all cash transactions. Day books recorded and dated all credit purchases and included, in a "Bespoke" section, those orders that the Clays could not immediately fill or deliver. Small transactions—purchases of a sheet or two of paper, for example—were probably paid for in cash as a rule. This is especially true of chapbook purchases, which rarely appear in the records, except among the Rugby schoolboys (who usually bought on credit). 10 Thus, the Clay day books cannot indicate the nature of cash purchases by provincial customers, particularly by those customers unwilling or unable to establish credit. Such cash purchases are generally unrecoverable. Although one of Thomas Clay's cash books survives (in two parts, NRO X7555 and NRO D6133), and although it records each week's receipts and expenses, it does not clearly indicate which of these receipts came from cash sales in the shop and which came from customers paying their accumulated bills. In the day books of William Huntley's business in colonial Williamsburg, recently analyzed by Cynthia Z. and Gregory Stiverson, totals of cash sales are recorded and amount to "26.8 percent of the nonbook sales and 31.4 percent of the book sales" between October 1750 and June 1752. 11 That is, proportionally more printed matter was sold for cash than were other items and services (paper, stationery, binding, printing, advertisements in the Virginia Gazette , etc.). If the Clays' cash sales were at all comparable, then total sales of books and other printed matter would comprise an even larger proportion of the business than the credit sales indicate. Table 2 offers no hint of the kinds of books sold by the Clays over the five decades that the records cover, but these varied enormously. Obviously, Feather's misidentification of the Rugby day book invalidates his conclusion that "books sold at Daventry were mainly schoolbooks in use at the Academy" (p. 202). These schoolbooks were bought by boys and masters at Rugby School, not the Daventry Dissenting Academy. Indeed, the purchases of boys at these two institutions are quite different, and deserve study by historians of eighteenth-century education. More important, however, the books sold at Daventry were extremely diverse, and testify to the ease with which the Clays were able to obtain publications from London for their customers. Not surprisingly, Bibles, books of common prayer, sermons, and devotional books were especially popular throughout the period, as were reference books, histories, schoolbooks, belles lettres, and so forth. 12 Although Feather believes that Clay "never really had a stock of books at all, except for chapbooks . . . ballads . . . and school textbooks" (p. 208), in fact the Clays stocked various works. Samuel Clay obtained a number of books from his father when he opened his Warwick shop. Day book D2930 shows that on August 21, for example, John sent Samuel the following books, among others: Patrick . . . Lowth 4 Vol. new 2.18.0 Doddridge Expositor 6 V: D° 2.9.0 Abernethy s Ser. 2 V: 4.4 Drelincourt on Death 3.4 Anson s Voyage 2.4 Hist. Mildmay or Magdalen 2 V. 2.— Peerage of Engl d 6 V. 13.— Hawkin s Work s 3 Vol. 3.— Eachard s Ecclesiat: Hist. 2 V: 2.— Samuel Clay's Warwick day book (NRO D2929) indicates that he sold none of these books on credit between August 1770 and March 1772, although he made 8d by circulating Hugh Kelly's Memoirs of a Magdalen, or the history of Louisa Mildmay and Anson's Voyages to three customers. 13 Clearly, however, he considered that he ought to stock such works, especially at such discounted prices; equally clearly, his father had them in stock. In fact, various references in the day books reveal that John Clay had a catalog of his stock to distribute to customers; for example, on July 7, 1759, he noted that he "lent [Mr. Earnsby of Hillmorton] my Catalogue" (NRO D2931). Other provincial booksellers also circulated catalogs: on March 1, 1759, John Clay received from "Mr. Calcott at Banbury" some books that Clay had ordered "out of his Catalogue"; Clay was charged £1.13.0 for the books and 3s6d for carriage (NRO D2931). Frequent notes made in the "Bespoke" sections of the day books to reorder various titles also indicate that all the Clays stocked popular works such as (to cite D2929) Leybourne's "Trader's Guide," "Hervey s Meditations," Goody Two Shoes , Pilgrim's Progress , and "New Week s Preparation to the Altar" (a devotional work), as well as the "ballads" and "histories" or chapbooks that Feather emphasizes. In sum, his assertion that such ballads and chapbooks constituted the chief part of the Clays' trade, apart from schoolbooks, part books, and magazines, is simply untenable upon closer examination of the records. Although the main business of the Daventry shop was to satisfy customers' demands for printed matter, then, the nature of those demands changed markedly over the four decades recorded, as Table 2.2 illustrates. Interestingly, whereas in all but one of the months examined, well over half the Daventry sales came from printed matter in general, 14 the shop experienced a decline in demand for printed books. During the last three months of 1747, sales of books alone (as opposed to other printed matter) came to £64.10.3½, or over half the total sales of £119.17.10¼ (excluding stamp duty). By contrast, during the comparable period in 1779, book sales came to £47.18.3, less than one-third of the total sales of £154.14.0. In 1747, sales of other printed matter accounted for a further £19.7.5 of sales between October and December, about one-sixth of the total (and including 3s3d for reading books from the circulating library). Overall, sales of print came to £83.17.8½, or about 70% of total sales for the last three months of 1747. In 1779, other printed matter absorbed a higher proportion of sales than it did in 1747: £42.5.½ or about 27%. Sales of printed matter altogether fell, however, to about 58% of the total sales over the three-month period. Feather's analysis of the Rugby and Lutterworth day books led him to conclude that provincial customers may have bought more books in the later decades of the Clays' operations than earlier (p. 207); in fact, they bought fewer. They turned their attention to various cheaper or more ephemeral productions. As Table 2.2 shows, declining sales of books were accompanied by increased sales of ephemeral material. Magazines enjoyed more than a fivefold increase, from £2.8.0 for the last three months of 1746 (or £2.9.6 for 1747) to £13.10.6 for the comparable period in 1779. These sales, though recorded exclusively in the Daventry day books, actually include subscriptions from customers who patronized the Rugby and Lutterworth shops as well. 15 Sales of almanacks skyrocketed from totals of £2.7.3 in the last three months of 1746 and £1.11.3 in the same period in 1747 to £22.13.0 between October and December 1779. Three wholesale customers, however, accounted for an enormous proportion of the 1779 total sales of almanacks (£18.10.33, or over 80%). Even if we choose to disregard these large wholesale purchases, retail purchases still doubled. Sales of songs and music books increased as well. Serial publications are the only form of printed matter apart from books whose sales seem to decrease during this period: from £12.3.0. between October and December 1747 to £3.16.3 in 1779. The figures for 1747 are inflated, however, by a total of £11.6.0 for successive volumes of the Universal History , usually charged at five shillings each. Possibly these purchases should be considered books rather than serials. If we examine the figures of the previous year, we find £3.6.6 spent on serials during the last quarter. In any case, the relatively slight demand for serial publications among the Clays' customers over these decades is striking in the light of R. M. Wiles' documentation of the enormous range and availability of books published serially. 16 Between 1746 and 1779, as Table 2.2 shows, magazines became far more attractive than serial publications to the Clays' customers, although both appealed to a variety of readers—from the rare servant or even laborer to the gentry. At Daventry, the largest proportion of the Clays' customers for these and other publications, however, were drawn from families whose breadwinner belonged to the professions. Clergymen were particularly good customers throughout the four decades, but some evidence indicates that from about 1770, magazines and serials became increasingly popular among farmers and tradesmen. 17 Feather's contention that most customers "were either the gentry of the locality or Clay's fellow tradesmen" (p. 208) is inaccurate with regard to Rugby and Lutterworth as well as Daventry, unless he is using the term "gentry" loosely, to refer to the professional classes as well. Changes over time in the demand for stationery are almost as revealing as the changed demand for books and other publications. Sales of blank books —primarily day books, ledgers, and other account books—tripled between 1747 and 1779, and sales of copybooks used in schools almost quadrupled. These figures suggest an increasingly prosperous economic life in the areas served by the Clays, as well as increased numbers of children who were given instruction in writing. Sales of paper alone show less dramatic gains: from £16.6.9½ for the last three months of 1747 to £19.19.6 for the same period in 1779. These figures do include a £6.0.0 wholesale order for paper by Mr. Brice; if it is disregarded, then retail sales of paper appear to double over the period. But it is misleading to disregard such orders. The totals for the last quarter of 1746 are similarly inflated by two wholesale orders totalling £19.13.5 altogether; the retail sales for 1746 actually come to £13.4.10½. Such "inflation" seems to be common in the 1740's. More impressive than the small growth in retail sales of paper is the rise in demand for "skins," the parchment and vellum used by lawyers: from about £2.0.0 in the last three months of 1746 and 1747 to £10.12.5 in 1779. This more than fivefold increase bears witness to the rising numbers and prosperity of provincial members of the legal professions. The rise in duty paid for stamps over the same period, from £12.9.0 in 1746 (or £29.1.3 in 1747) to £70.19.6 in 1779 partially reflects this increase in lawyers' activities, though at least half arises from increases in the stamp duty. By the end of the 1770's, a great proportion of Thomas Clay's revenue came from sales of legal stationery. A bill made out to one of his legal customers, Charles Simon Oakden of Daventry, survives for the year 1778: it comes to £118.3.5 for stamp duty, stationery (including "skins"), and writing implements (NRO D6786). This enormous sum almost exactly equals the amount spent by all Thomas Clay's customers at Daventry (including Oakden) on the same goods between October and December 1779 (£118.0.8½; see Table 2.1). Interestingly, however, these huge sales of legal stationery seem to be a development of the late 1760's and the 1770's. Earlier, lawyers absorbed a much smaller proportion of John Clay's sales of stationery. Feather exaggerates, then, when he asserts that John Clay was "typical of country stationers" in building his business "around the supply of law stationery" (p. 208). Before the 1770's, the receipts of the Daventry shop depended very little on sales of legal stationery, although a number of lawyers were customers. 18 The Clay business records, then, provide firm evidence that bookselling could be a thriving trade in the provinces in the second half of the eighteenth century. Although the demand for various kinds of publications underwent some important changes, it remained high during the period covered by the records. The profitability of the Clays' shops in Daventry, Rugby, and Lutterworth is clear; John Clay was able to raise, educate, and provide for a family of nine children (four others died in infancy). Throughout his career, his day books show that he was able to make loans to various customers and friends. In 1770, he was even able to lend his brother-in-law Charles Watkins, a prosperous draper in Daventry, the sum of £353. 19 Similarly, although Samuel Clay abandoned his shop in Warwick in June 1772 when his brother William died, and took over William's Rugby-based grocery and ironmongery business, he resumed bookselling in Rugby on the death of his brother Thomas in 1781. The Daventry business was sold on Thomas's death to William Culling-worth, a surveyor, but Samuel Clay operated the Rugby shop until at least 1789, 20 and probably until 1794. By then he had become a banker as well. Samuel Clay's willingness to remain a bookseller in Rugby despite his other lucrative ventures testifies to the profitability of the Rugby shop. Admittedly, Rugby offered a particularly attractive market during this period. Thomas James, the headmaster of Rugby School from 1778, apparently increased the number of boys at the school from fifty-two in 1778 to two hundred forty-five by 1794. 21 Finally, perhaps the most interesting evidence of the profitability of selling books to provincial customers comes from a deposition taken from Benjamin Kite at Peterborough in 1794. He had "travelled the Country &amp; maintained himself by selling second hand Books &amp; c." (NRO PSJ 225/12). 22 Kite was literate and had been a Clay customer, in fact: he paid 1s3d cash on April 12, 1770 (D2930), for unnamed items that he had received earlier—perhaps old books, which Clay sometimes bought and sold by the pound, or possibly almanacks for resale. That Kite could support himself, however minimally, in this way within the Clays' area offers further testimony to the healthy demand for reading matter among these provincial customers. The profitability of commercial bookselling in the midlands arose, then, from the hearty provincial appetite for books. A history of this demand offers important insight into the social history of reading. The substantial and increased sales of ephemera like almanacks and magazines in the 1770's may seem to suggest that by then a "reading revolution" was taking place, of the sort postulated by Rolf Engelsing and others. But at the same time, there was a substantial trade in "classics," or reprints of all kinds, from devotional works to children's books. These were bought by new generations of those groups which had traditionally been readers—the gentry and the professional classes—as well as by new readers from the "middling classes": farmers, yeomen, tradesmen, apprentices, servants and the like. Here we have evidence that "intensive reading"—or the rereading of a small group of "classics"—was not necessarily abandoned as "extensive" reading increased. They coexisted and still do. 23 The relatively slight interest of customers in obtaining books from the Clays' circulating library also suggests, in fact, that the notion of extensive reading—a quick perusal for pleasure—was not very attractive among these provincial customers. More attractive was the notion of sharing books. Book clubs, which allowed members both to share and to own books, were very popular among the Clays' customers; at least nine existed between 1746-81, a few of them for decades. Similarly, a number of customers shared magazine subscriptions; they also ordered and delivered books for one another. Generally, then, the Clay records bear witness to a flourishing provincial reading community, some of whose members kept in close touch with publishing activity in London largely through advertisements in newspapers. Many of those customers who took the Monthly Review and the Critical Review , for example, did not wait to receive their reviews before ordering books and pamphlets advertised in the Northampton Mercury and elsewhere. Indeed, our preliminary survey suggests that less than half of the books bought by subscribers to the reviews in 1758-59 and 1764-66 were actually reviewed at all during the twelve months before they were purchased. Such subscribers may have used their reviews primarily to keep in touch with informed opinion in London, rather than to guide their purchases of books. In a similar manner, many of the Clays' medical customers—physicians, apothecaries, surgeons, and so forth—obtained medical books almost immediately upon publication in London. 24 What the Clay records show, then, is a provincial community whose links with the London book trade were firm and lively. At a distance of seventy-two miles, the division between town and country was not too great to be crossed. Certainly, the provincial reading public, and the Clay booksellers, behaved as if that distance were negligible. TABLE: 1: CLAY BUSINESS RECORDS DEPOSITED IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE RECORD OFFICE I.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For the earliest years covered by the Clay records, Ian Maxted's The London Book Trades, 1775-1800: A Preliminary Checklist of Members (1977), p. xxxi, indicates that 649 books were published in London in 1746, 508 in 1747, 528 in 1748, and 574 in 1758 and 1759 as well. 2 These are the periods that the surviving Daventry records cover. Table 1 contains a complete list of the Clay records, a mine for eighteenth-century social historians. 3 The Rugby ledgers include a few customers other than boys and masters who were generally connected with the school: e.g., Miss Crossfield, the daughter of Thomas Crossfield, headmaster between 1742 and 1744. She boarded some of the schoolboys. 4 2 vols., Rugby: A. J. Lawrence, 1886. 5 The Universal British Directory of Trade, Commerce, and Manufacture (1798), 5: 168. 6 The distances from Daventry are cited in The Universal British Directory of Trade, Commerce, and Manufacture (1791), 2: 771. Day book D2925 indicates that John Clay took orders in Rugby on Wednesday, October 12, and Wednesday, October 19, 1768; he may have been en route to Lutterworth for the Thursday market there. Although Lutterworth was seventeen miles from Daventry, it was only six or eight miles from Rugby by contemporary roads, according to rather inconsistent entries in Paterson's Roads , as revised by Edward Mogg (1824), pp. 550 and 383. Early evidence that Clay kept a horse is provided by an entry on November 4, 1746 (NRO D64), indicating that he put his horse in a neighbor's close for three weeks. 7 In his article, Feather cites the manuscript version of Table 1 that has been on file at the Northamptonshire Record Office since August, 1980. He must have found the table confusing, for in it D2925 is labelled a Rugby day book. 8 Comparative Account of the Population of Great Britain in the Years 1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831 . . . Ordered to be Printed by the House of Commons, 1831 (1831). 9 As Tables 3.1 and 3.2 show, our figures do not entirely correspond with Feather's. The discrepancies reflect differences in reading and interpreting entries. For example, Feather has a total of 7s6d spent on medicine in October, 1768, whereas we have none. Probably he considered the charge of 7s6d for "Buchan's Domestic Medicine" a reference to a patent medicine; in fact, William Buchan's Domestic Medicine (Edinburgh: Balfour, Auld, and Smellie, 1769) was one of the most popular medical books of the period. (See Charles E. Rosenberg, "Medical Text and Social Context: Explaining William Buchan's Domestic Medicine ," Bulletin of the History of Medicine 57 [1983]: 22-42.) The entry for Buchan's book is in fact a re-entry. The original sale was made to Mr. Hawkes, an apothecary, on December 24, 1777, re-entered ("Bro t forwards") because still unpaid on April 2, 1778, and then re-entered again on October 17. Accordingly, we have not counted it among books sold in October 1778. 10 These purchases are analyzed in our unpublished paper, "Chapbook Reading and Provincial Readership," presented at the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies annual convention in Boston, April 1984. 11 "The Colonial Retail Book Trade in America," in William L. Joyce, David D. Hall, Richard D. Brown, and John B. Hench, eds., Printing and Society in Early America (1983), p. 144. 12 We are engaged in a fuller study of provincial buying and reading habits. At present, some indication of what sorts of books provincial customers bought and read can be found in the appendices to Fergus, "Eighteenth-Century Readers in Provincial England: The Customers of Samuel Clay's Circulating Library and Bookshop in Warwick, 1770-72," PBSA 78 (1984): 200-214. 13 Fergus, "Eighteenth-Century Readers," Appendix II, pp. 200-204. 14 The exception occurs in December, 1746, when (as mentioned earlier) Mr. Brice ordered £17.5.6 worth of stationery, making the total sales of stationery for that month exceed those for books by about £2 (more than £22 for stationery versus more than £20 for books and other printed matter; see Table 2.2). 15 See Fergus, "Women, Class, and the Growth of Magazine Readership in the Provinces, 1746-80" to be published in volume 16 of Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture , ed. O M Brack, Jr. (1987). The partial list given there in Table 2.2 of magazines taken in December 1770 differs from Feather's list on p. 209, which seems to refer to the same month. The discrepancies appear to be due to the cramped, crowded handwriting used in the entries. For example, nine customers took the Gentleman's Museum or Grand Imperial Mazazine , not forty-nine; the other forty took the Town and Country . Thirty took the London Magazine , not thirty-four; the remaining four subscribed to the Freeholder's Magazine . The "Review" is the Monthly Review , with eight subscribers. 16 Serial Publication in England before 1750 (1957). 17 See Fergus, "Women, Class, and the Growth of Magazine Readership"; see also discussion of class in relation to buying and borrowing of books, "Eighteenth-Century Readers," pp. 186-189. 18 Sales of stationery in the market shops at Rugby and Lutterworth, however, may have been predominantly legal throughout. Unfortunately, since no records survive before 1768, it is impossible to determine what earlier purchases were. The Caldecott who bought so many legal supplies from John Clay in October 1768, identified by Feather as Thomas Caldecott of Daventry, was in fact William Caldecott, a prosperous attorney in Rugby and a member of the Calcott/Caldecote family of Cat-thorpe in Leicestershire (see John Nichols, History and Antiquities of Leicester [1815; reprint ed. East Ardsley, Wakefield, Yorkshire: S. R. Publishers Ltd. and Leicester County Council, 1971], 4:70). 19 See the entry for May 16, 1770 in NRO D2930. John Clay had married Ann Rushworth, the daughter of a Northampton physician, on April 14, 1743 at Church Brampton near Northampton. Charles Watkins had married her sister Alicia on December 7, 1741 (NRO H. I. Longden Pedigree/Rushworth). Clay probably met his wife through Charles and Alicia Watkins, for Ann Rushworth was listed as a resident of Daventry at the time of her marriage (NRO Church Brampton 67p/2). Interestingly, through the connections of his wife's large family, John Clay was related to many of his customers—which may in fact be true of other successful tradesmen in the provinces. 20 The title page of a book located in the British Library, shelf mark 11201.b.1— General View of Geography, Ancient and Modern . . . For the Use of Rugby School (Coventry: N. Rollaston, 1789)—indicates that the work was sold by "S. Clay in Rugby." We are grateful to R. C. Alston for locating this reference for us in ESTC. See also his list of other Clay publications in "The Clays of Daventry: A Footnote to Booktrade History," in Factotum: Newsletter of the XVIIIth century STC , no. 21 (1985), 10-11. 21 W. H. D. Rouse, A History of Rugby School (1898), p 120. 22 We are grateful to J. A. Minchinton of the Northamptonshire Record Office for bringing this document to our attention. 23 Robert Darnton has also rejected the notion that a clear "reading revolution" took place in the eighteenth century in France; see The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History (1984), pp. 249-251. 24 Professor Ronald Sawyer, History Department, Rice University, brought this fact to our attention; we are collaborating on a study of customers who bought medical works and medicines through the Clays. ** incomplete (a) Includes £17.5.6 order by Mr. Brice, Leicester, for paper. (b) A number of transactions listed between October and December 1747 do not indicate prices; these include, among others, sixteen books and twelve plays ordered in November, at least thirteen reams of paper, etc. Almost all the 1747 figures are thus somewhat lower than they should be. A number of entries for October-December 1746—particularly sales to a William Smart, who may have been a bookseller—also lack prices. By contrast, only a few entries in 1779 are similarly unpriced.

      <field name="fulltext">D.[avid] P.[arkes] (1763-1833), antiquary, frequent contributor to the GM (often as ΔII.), was an admirer of William Shenstone about whom and whose poetry he contributed several pieces to that periodical. Parkes contributed a poem on Mr. Horne, a former owner of Leasowes (Shenstone's home), "by a gentleman who was the intimate friend of Mr. Shenstone" (1804. ii. 802-803). The poem begins, "Tho' Shenstone's genius and poetic taste," is dated " June , 1779," and is signed "R. G---s." "R. G---s." is, of course, Shenstone's very good friend, Richard Graves; the poem was unknown to Graves's modern biographer and to the editor of the Oxford Spiritual Quixote , Grave's best-known work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arthur Mainwaring (?) An anonymous correspondent to the GM (1785. ii. 1030-1031) wrote, The following Poem, I doubt not, has been in print; but probably is not now to be met with. I think it a pity it should perish, and therefore send it you to be inserted in your Magazine. Who the author was I cannot tell; but it has much the appearance of one of Swift's Grubs , as he used to call his ballads and penny-papers. Your readers, however, will judge for themselves. The index to the poetry section for this volume of the GM listed the poem as "Ballad, a Grub one, probably by Swift." The poem, entitled "The History and Fall of the Occasional Conformity Bill; Being an Excellent New Song. To the Tune of the Ladies Fall ," is listed in Margaret Crum, ed. First-line Index of English Poetry 1500-1800 in Manuscripts of the Bodleian Library (1969), G 242. There it is said to be by Arthur Mainwaring on the authority of John Oldmixon, editor of the Life and Posthumous Works of Mainwaring (1715), pp. 40-41, where only stanzas 10-16 and 35, eight out of the thirty-eight four-line stanzas, are printed. Substantive differences between the two texts are as follows, with the GM reading first, i.e. stanza and line: 10:3 will/he'll; 10:4 "Twill . . . plog 1 He'll . . . clog; 13:1 a/no; 13:2 never/ever; 14:4 and/nor; 15:1 that God doth/our Lord can; 15:2 doth/does; 16:1 So/Sure; 16:1 say they/I say; 16:2 Whence ever/Where-ever; 16:3 and/For; 35:3 in time/at length. The poem is printed in Poems on Affairs of State, From 1640 to this present Year 1704 ; vol. III. (1704), pp. 425-431 and in A New Collection of Poems Relating to State Affairs (1705), pp. 557-561. The GM text has forty-five substantive differences from the other text, i.e. that of the three pieces already mentioned, there being no substantive differences among the three. In six places in the GM text names are given where only initials appear in the other: 25.3, Sir Edward Seymour, or John How; 28.1, Harley; 30.4, Bishop Burnet's; 32.1, Nottingham; 32.3, Guernsey; 33.4, his Grace of Buck. The whole matter may be of little import, but the GM text is almost surely independent and possibly one of the first printed texts to spell out the identifications. Mainwaring was an important and influential person in his time, a political satirist, the text of whose verse satires is of some interest. The poem has been edited by Frank H. Ellis in volume 7 of Poems on Affairs of State (1975), pp. 3-14 with textual notes on pp. 627-628. There is no mention of the GM text and hence no discussion of its place in the descent of the text, eighteen manuscripts of which are listed by Ellis. One other printed text of the poem, in Political Merriment, Or, Truths Told to Some Tune (1715), also lacks identification of the names concealed by the initials. Further of interest, the poem, besides being attributed to Swift, was attributed to Congreve by Pope, while two other possible authors were mentioned by Oldmixon, i.e. Lieutenant General Mordaunt and "Lord H[alifax?]" (p. 40).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir Christopher Wren The running heads on pp. 114 and 115 of the March 1753 GM read, respectively, "Wren on the New River Water" and "Sir Chr. Wren on regulating the New River Pipes," while a headnote reads, "Thoughts of Sir Christopher Wren concerning the Distribution of the New River Water; not published in his Works or elsewhere." The piece begins, "Being desired by some persons of honour concerned in the New River water, to give them my thoughts about the most profitable distribution of the water; and particularly how the high parts about Soho Square might be supplied; I have, as well as my age and the continual avocations of publick business would permit, applied myself to make the best enquiries I could, about the present state of the water." After confessing that he can offer no good advice because of fundamental errors "in laying down the contrivances," he proceeds to explain how "an able mathematician" would have gone about the project. He concludes by stating that he had been lately to Soho square to test his theories, which actual practice demonstrated to be accurate. Thirteen years later it was reported in the GM (1766, p. 101) that "A thirty-sixth share of the King's moiety of the New-River , sold this day at the Senegal coffee-house for 4400 l ." The project was obviously a profitable one, hence the call upon Sir Christopher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurence Sterne The Historical Chronicle in the July 1769 GM , under the date of "Monday, 31," reported the following, the sort of tid-bit about Sterne's artistry as opposed to his morality that should be more widely known: It is reported that the body of Mr Sterne, the ingenious author of Triſtram Shandy, which was buried at Marybone, has been taken up and anatomized by a ſurgeon at Oxford. That gentleman, tho' happy in a fertile genius, does not ſeem to have been happy thro' life. He lived during the firſt period of his life in obſcurity and poverty; and in the latter part in a ſtate of ſeperation from his wife, who choſe rather to retire to a convent in France with her amiable daughter, than live in England under the daily provocations of an unkind huſband. For tho' the Rev. Mr. Sterne was a great wit, it cannot be ſaid that he was a deſirable companion for a woman of delicacy. Years later, one "J. M.," writing from Winchester and hence almost surely identifiable as the Reverend Dr. John Milner (1752-1826), a prolific writer on theological and archaeological subjects (see DNB ), declared that he had "always looked upon Sterne to be one of the most dangerous writers of his time" because he associated real "sentiment and religion" with "buffoonry and obscenity" (1794. ii. 593). However, as further proof of Sterne's plagiarism, he referred readers to "'An Essay towards the Theory of the Intelligible World, by Gabriel John,' supposed to be Tom D'Urfy, published in the first year of the present century." He continued by pointing out that in that work "we have a Preface in the middle of the work, sections concerning weathercocks and button-holes, a chapter which is announced to be the best in the book, and another which the reader is desired not to look into." Milner had taken as his point of departure an earlier contribution to the GM on the subject of Sterne's plagiarism (1794. i. 406). While the earlier contribution may be dismissed, Milner's suggestion about the work attributed to D'Urfey merits attention. Four years after Milner's suggestion, John Ferriar, M.D., in the first extended examination of Sterne's sources or plagiarisms, the Illustrations of Sterne , published in 1798, would not presume to determine whether Sterne made any use of a whimsical book, apparently published about the year 1748, (for it has no date) under the title of, An Essay towards the Theory of the Intelligible World, by Gabriel John. It is a pretty close copy of the Tale of a Tub in manner; some appearances of imitation may, therefore, be supposed to result from the common reference of both writers to Swift. If Sterne can be supposed to have taken any thing from this book, it must be the hint of his marbled pages. . . . The essay in question was professedly composed to satirize Norris's Theory of the Ideal World (pp. 52-3). Much is amiss here: the Essay was published in 1701, not "about the year 1748," and therefore could not have been aping Swift's Tale of a Tub , published in 1704, nor would it be satirizing John Norris's work, published in 1701-04, some forty-five years after the publication of that work. One can only assume, given the absence of references to those features of the work attributed to D'Urfey which Sterne imitated, that Ferriar did not know the GM piece by Milner. Mr. Kenneth Monkman kindly informs me that "Hillhouse, in his The Grub Street Journal , quotes a reference in that journal to a mad 'Mr Gregory of Christ Church, Oxford,' who wrote under the pseudonym of Gabriel John—the name pinned to the Essay ," and that, hence, D'Urfey may not be the author of the Essay . However, the identity of the author of the Essay is of less consequence than the possibility that Sterne knew and borrowed from it. An anonymous contributor to the February 1796 GM (p. 151) wrote, "The following composition, there is every reason to believe, was written by the celebrated Mr. Sterne. It is sufficient to observe, that he is supposed to have written it on re-visiting, at an advanced period of his life, the house of a gentleman to whose daughter, in his early days, he had paid his addresses." The poem, in octosyllabic couplets, begins "O CAROLINE, thy form recalls," is dated 1755, and bears the signature L. S. In 1739, according to Sterne's modern biographer, Sterne wrote to the Reverend John Dealtary about a lady he had fallen in love with and whose identity he disguised as "Miss C---." Among other things, he wrote, "I am convinced she is fixed in a resolution never to marry, and as the whole summ of happiness I ever proposed was staked upon that single Point, I see nothing left for me at present but a dreadful Scene of uneasiness &amp; Heartache." 2 The authenticity of the poem as Sterne's gains from the existence of a Miss C--- with whom he fell in love as a young man and from the fact that it is a somewhat extended verse rendering of the sentiments in the letter. In a letter dated Jan. 26 which appeared in the March 1799 GM (pp. 196-197) S. A., writing from M. B., suggested that Sterne had seen a pamphlet which he, S. A., supposed to be scarce. S. A. is almost surely Samuel Asycough; M. B. is almost as surely a transposition of B. M., i.e. the British Museum, where Ayscough was an assistant librarian. Ayscough was a fairly frequent contributor to the GM ; his letters were headed B. M. In any event, the scarce pamphlet is titled "Occasional Reflections in a Journey from London to Norwich and Cambridge," and was "Printed and sold by A. Baldwin, near the Oxford Arms, in Warwick-lane, 1711." While the few extracts given are all of interest in the matter of the sources of A Sentimental Journey , one in particular stands out, an account of an encounter with some beggars which bears marked similarities of tone with the parallel account in the novel. So, too, with the extract having to do with the "horse half-starved and overloaded." Some year and half earlier "An Admirer of Sterne" had anticipated Ayscough, writing in the October 1797 European Magazine (pp. 240-241), that "The story [of the beggars in the Journey ] is taken from page 6 of a small pamphlet entitled 'Occasional Reflections in a Journey from London to Norwich and Cambridge.' Printed by A. Baldwin, Warwick-Lane, MDCCXI." Sterne's admirer claimed only that the Reflections was written in the same style as Sterne's; he suggested no plagiarism. The Occasional Reflections runs only to twenty-eight pages, but there is enough matter for students of Sterne, steeped in the two novels, to ponder. The unknown author, like Sterne, was not above coining words, and one will look in vain in the OED for "Petycrain," in a context which plainly means "little brain" (p. 8). It is unfortunate that the Reflections was not known to Gardner D. Stout, Jr., editor of the definitive edition of A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy by Mr. Yorick (1967).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alexander Pope The April 1770 GM (pp. 159-160) printed some "Anecdotes of Mr. Pope, Dr. Swift, Count Gyllenberg, the Swede, &amp;c." Since there is no entry for either Dr. Burton or Dr. Thompson in the index to the Twickenham Pope and, as would naturally follow, no mention in the Twickenham Minor Poems volume of either the couplet attributed to Pope or the epigram of uncertain authorship, I assume the Pope anecdotes, which I now quote in their entirety, are generally unknown. Both doctors are mentioned in Pope's letters, however. During Mr. Pope's last illness, a squabble happened in his chamber between his two physicians, Dr. Burton, and Dr. Thompson (both since dead.) Dr. B. charging Dr. T. with hastening his death by the violent purges he had prescribed, and the other retorting the charge, Mr. Pope at length silenced them, saying, "Gentlemen, I only learn by your discourse, that I am in a very dangerous way; therefore all I have now to ask, is, that the following epigram may be added, after my death, to the new edition of the Dunciad, by way of postscript: Dunces, rejoice: Forgive all censures past The greatest dunce has kill'd your foe at last. Others say, that these lines were really written by Dr. Burton himself: And the following epigram, by a friend of Dr. Thompson's, was occasioned by the foregoing one: As Physic and Verse both to Phoebus belong, So the College oft dabble in potion and song; Hence Burton, resolv'd his emetics shall hit, When his recipes fail, gives a puke with his wit. Mr. Pope, on his death-bed, was under an odd perplexity about Extreme-Unction. If he did not receive it, it would disgust the Catholicks: If he did, and should recover, his Protestant friends would rally him. He probably thought of it as King Augustus of Poland did of his bead-roll, C'est une bagatelle . Lord Lovat, in like manner, was doubtful whether he should profess himself, when under sentence of death, a Protestant or a Papist; and was determined to the latter, merely on account of its being most consistent with his having espoused the cause of the Pretender.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Bubb Dodington, Lord Melbombe The GM for August 1781 (pp. 383-384) prints a poem to Dodington with the following prefatory statement: The late Lord Melcombe, when Mr. Dodington, having permitted a certain writer of verſes to dedicate a volume of Poems to him, and put the author to ſome expence by directing him to cancel the dedication, when the whole impreſſion was printed off, and to draw up another with certain compliments, the heads of which his Lordſhip was pleaſed to furniſh; he took no farther notice of him, except that he ſhewed him his houſe at Hammerſmith with great oſtentation. The diſappointed Bard, to whoſe circumſtances, and very good character, his Lordſship, was no ſtranger, ſent him the following copy of verſes, which, being delivered to him by the hands of Lady H___, produced a handſome preſent. To the Right Honourable George Bub Dodington. Timothy Tagwell, Haberdaſher of Dedications, and Dealer in Verſe and Proſe, takes the Liberty to bring in his Bill — and his Reaſons for ſo doing The poem is quite clever, the poet itemizing Dodington's indebtedness to him and concluding "that paper and print, / And stamping the whole in poetical mint, / Have been very expensive—and yet not a cross / I've receiv'd to the credit of profit and loss." I do not know who Timothy Tagwell is. William Prideaux Courtney, writing on "George Bubb Dodington and his Literary Circle," 3 names various of the writers associated with Dodington, and because the date of Dodington's purchase of "the house at Hammersmith," given as 1740 by Courtney, rules out one possible candidate, George Stubbes, and because Moses Browne, despite the fact that he had earlier (1729) dedicated his "Piscatory Eclogue" to Dodington, did not publish "a volume of Poems" between 1740 and 1762, the latter being the date of Dodington's death, he too must be ruled out. Dodington would not have treated Christopher Pitt, Edward Young, or James Thomson, the principal poets of his literary circle, in the fashion described in the headnote.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oliver Goldsmith In this same year, in January 1781, the GM printed an "Epitaph in Jamaica. By Dr. Goldsmith. Not printed in his Works . On Zachary Bayly, Esq. " (p. 39). The epitaph gives no further clue to Bayly's identity, nor is his death listed in Musgrave's Obituaries . The epitaph is not included or mentioned in Arthur Friedman's definitive edition of Goldsmith's works, and Bayly's name is not recorded in the indexes to biographies of Goldsmith.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Robert Herrick L. C. Martin, editor of The Poetical Works of Robert Herrick (1956), writing about Herrick's reputation, and having already traced the relatively few notices about him after his death in 1674, noted that "Inquiry in the Gentleman's Magazine (May 1796) had elicited some fresh information about him" (p. xix). What Martin and others have overlooked is two prior notices of Herrick in the GM , the first in 1773 when T. Herne enclosed two poems, "The Invitation to Corinna" (now known as "Corinna's going a Maying") and "The Captived Bee; or Little Filcher," prefacing them with the statement that "The enclosed poems were copied from the leaves of an old book brought from a chandler's shop. If you think them worth preserving, perhaps some of your readers may direct to the author, who seems to have been of the 15th or 16th century, and no contemptible poet" (p. 243). Whoever Herne was, he knew good poetry. Ten years later "J. B.," in the course of a letter on Milton, quoted Herrick's "To M. Henry Lawes, the excellent Composer of his Lyricks" and added that among Herrick's "pious pieces are the words of a Christmas Caroll, sung to the King, as also the New Yeeres Gift, or Circumcisions song, which were composed by him" (1783, p. 128). J. B. described Herrick as "a Poet little known." And, as Martin and others have noted, in the May 1796 GM , "W. F. I." wished "to procure some information of the following old poets," among whom was Herrick (p. 304). Replies were immediately forthcoming, a full account by John Nichols, writing as Eugenio, one of his pseudonyms (pp. 461-462), and a brief note by "Leviter Eruditus" (p. 463). Nichols printed three poems by Herrick in June of the same year (pp. 509-510). "Leviter Eruditus" had more to say in August (p. 645), while in September (p. 736) "O. D." added a biographical snippet and repeated a tradition that Herrick's poem on the river Dean-bourne was conveyed by oral tradition from father to son. And that there was also the belief that Herrick wrote Poor Robin's Almanac , usually attributed to William Winstanley and others (p. 736). What is notable, besides full analysis of the GM pieces and the reminder that Eugenio was John Nichols and knew whereof he wrote, is that in the two poems submitted for printing in 1773 there are a number of substantive differences from the received texts. For "Corinna's going a Maying" I give the received text first: l. 6, Dew-be spangling/dew—bespangled; l. 8, you not drest/you're still undrest; l. 19 lacks the "spangled" of 1773; l. 24, on/in; l. 28, once we/we're to; l. 30 grove (2)/street (2); l. 34, a/or; l. 45, is/are. The most interesting differences are in ll. 8, 19, and 30, especially the last. Readers will decide their own preferences, remembering that the poems were "copied." "The captiv'd Bee: or, The little Filcher" is sufficiently short so that I give the received text with the 1773 differences in the margin, so that readers may assess the nature of the differences more readily. As Julia once a slumb'ring lay, It chanc't a Bee did flie that way, (After a dew, or dew-like shower) To tipple freely in a flower. For some rich flower, he took the lip Of Julia , and began to sip; But when he felt he suckt from thence Hony, and in the quintessence: Honey in He drank so much he scarce co'd stir; So Julia took the Pilferer.

      <field name="fulltext">William Cowper I find it curious that in the definitive bibliography of William Cowper's work there is no mention in the section on Translations of his translation of Dr. Jortin's Latin verses on the brevity of human life. 5 The translation, with Dr. Jortin's Latin and six lines of doggerel verse by Cowper, was reprinted in the February 1814 GM (p. 166) and bore the signature and date "W. C., Jan. 1801." Although the translation was written in 1784, it was first published, according to the Oxford edition, by William Hayley in 1804. Hayley prints six lines of doggerel, omitting Cowper's final two lines as they appear in his letter to John Newton dated 25 January 1784, i.e. "for the use of Mankind, both before and behind," arousing the suspicion that his source was something other than Cowper's letter. The possible explanation is that a version of the poem with only the first six lines of the doggerel appeared in some periodical in January 1801. The only substantive difference in the GM text is "globe" for "glebe" in line 10. Also missing is the printing of all but the last six lines of an inscription "On a Stone erected at the Planting of a Grove of Oaks at Chillington, the Seat of T. Gifford, Esq., 1790" in the May 1815 GM (p. 387). 6 Two epitaphs by Cowper were reprinted in the September 1815 GM (p. 195); the first is titled "At New-port Pagnel, Buckinghamshire. On T. A. Hamilton," the title in the Oxford edition being "Inscription for the Tomb of Mr. Hamilton." The second appears as "On Mrs. Higgins, of Weston-under-Edge, near Newport-Pagnel, Bucks." as opposed to the Oxford edition's "Epitaph on Mrs. Higgins, of Weston." In this latter poem, the only substantive difference is "those," in the last line in the GM text, for "theirs." More interesting differences exist in the two versions of the epitaph on Hamilton, with the received text first in what follows: l. 3, Life's silent/Health's sounding; l. 4, Health/Life; l. 6, an heart/a heart; l. 7, ofttimes healthful and/healthful and oft-time. The appearances of these poems and the textual variants have been noted. 7 The "J. C." who submitted the epitaphs, having already submitted some in the previous volume (1815. i. 292), was Joseph Cockfield of Upton. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Chatterton Although the letter of the Reverend Mr. John Chapman to Dr. Andrew Ducarel, dated Dec. 15, 1771, and that of William Barrett to the same recipient, dated March 7, 1772, contributed to the GM in May and June 1786 (pp. 361-362, 460-461) by "Eugenio" (i.e. John Nichols) are both known and are mentioned in E. H. W. Meyerstein's biography of Chatterton, 9 no attention has been paid to the text of some of Chatterton's poetry contained therein. In the May number of the GM the Reverend Mr. Chapman wrote that he had asked George Catcott permission to copy the whole of the "tragedy of Ellie," but all he could get was the enclosed extract, which he described thus: "Bertha, his lady, is distressed by his absence, and calls for music to soothe her melancholy. The minstrels describe in their songs the four seasons. The first and third, Spring and Autumn, are all the specimens I could procure." He further added, "The tragedy is in the sole possession of Mr. Catcott; the other pieces are betwixt them: but I believe the originals are all with Mr. Barrett." In what follows I give the received reading in Professor Donald S. Taylor's edition of Chatterton's works (1971, 2 vols., I. 185-186) first and then the GM reading, but without regard to differences in punctuation. L. 278 atte/all; l. 279, sprenged/springedde; l. 281, yonge/springe; l. 282, ynto . . . straughte/yntee . . . strayghte; l. 283, Whenn . . . to . . . whestlyng . . . brought/Whanne . . . the . . . whestlynge . . . bryghte; l. 296, blake/blieke; l. 300, al/at; l. 301, lemes/lennes; l. 304, When/Whanne; l. 307, steynced/steyned. The Reverend Mr. Chapman may have made errors in his transcription and printers have often proved fallible, but despite palpable errors in lines 278, 282 (yntee), 283 (the), 300, and 301, there are enough substantive variants left to permit speculation as to the uniqueness of the text from which the reverend gentleman made his transcription. The GM readings in lines 282 (strayghte) and 307 (steyned) are the same as in the Cambridge manuscript, although in line 296 Cambridge has "Sun burnt" where both the received and GM texts have "sonne brente." The GM reading in line 281 ("springe" for "yonge") is not only unique but also makes sense. So, too, with line 296, as the GM 's "blieke" for the received "blake" (i.e. naked) may be said to make better sense, although it is possibly less Chattertonian. Thomas Tyrwhitt, considering the authenticity of the Rowley poems, under his category of "words used by other writers, but in a different sense," quoted two instances of the use of "blake," both from Ælla , and wrote, " Blake , in old English, may signifie either black , or bleake . Chatterton, in both these passages [ll. 178, 407], renders it naked ; and, in the latter, some such signification seems absolutely necessary to make any sense." 10 Finally, because it too has gone unnoted and may be of some slight interest, there is a footnote on page 362 keyed to the line "Whanne at the hyls wy the woddie* sede ys whyte," which reads " Wood , a plant much cultivated in the neighbourhood of Bristol." OED gives "A tree Obs ." as the first definition of "wood," with illustrative quotations from Beowulf and Tindal, the latter dated 1526. William Barrett wrote to Dr. Ducarel on March 7, 1772 and concluded his letter by saying "I will subjoin an elegant little poem copied verbatim et literatim [my emphasis] from Rowley's original penes me " ( GM , 1786. i. 460). The "elegant little poem" was "addressed to John Lydgate the poet; the subject in praise of Ella, a Saxon governor of the castle of Bristol 'in daies of yore'." The received text in Taylor's edition is at I. 61-62. There are thirty-six lines in the poem and there are variants in all but lines 2, 17, and 18. Of the thirty-three variants all but seven are of spelling and need not be listed, as the GM is not rare. The first reading, as before, is from Taylor's edition: l. 5, hayre/lockes; l. 10, There/Then; l. 11, by thy burled/bie thie burlie; l. 22, hearste/ken'st; l. 26, Ifrayning/Yprauncynge; l. 30, glare/glow; l. 32, Let Bristowe still/Stylle lette Bristowe. GM shares "lockes" of line 5 and "Then" of line 10 with MS. B6493; except for the first word in each, "bie thie burlie" of line 11 with "with thie burlye" with the Westminster Magazine (Jan. 1775) and the 1777a edition; "glow" of line 30 with B1a and the William Andrew Clarke MS (B6493 and Westminster Magazine have "glow'st"); and "Stylle lette Bristowe" of line 32 with the Clarke library MS. In two readings, "ken'st" of line 22, and "Yprauncynge" of line 26, GM agrees with all texts other than the BMB MS, copy-text for the poem. 11 These substantive variants, coupled with the extensive differences in spelling, give pause. William Barrett wrote that he copied the poem "verbatim et literatim" from the original in his possession (" penes me "). If this is indeed true, and there seems no reason to doubt Barrett, especially since the manuscript of the poem is known to have been in his possession, 12 the whole matter of copy-text becomes muddled. Professor Taylor very understandingly uses BMB, a miscellany which has this poem as well as a Chatterton letter and many notes in Barrett's hand, as his copy-text. Barrett, in 1772, had "Rowley's original," i.e. Chatterton's holograph; fourteen years later, the letter in which he included a copy of the poem, transcribed word for word and letter for letter, was reprinted in the GM . In the meantime, Tyrwhitt's edition of the Rowley poems had appeared, two editions in 1777 and a third in 1778 with its Appendix in which Tyrwhitt proved the poems were by Chatterton. The GM text shares a number of spelling variants with the text in Tyrwhitt's third edition, differs in a number of spellings, and shares no substantive variants with it. Except for the possible slight errors of spelling in his transcription, despite Barrett's claim of copying Rowley's original letter for letter, the GM text of the Song to Ella must be taken into consideration. Murray Warren's Descriptive and Annotated Bibliography of Thomas Chatterton (1977), under the rubric of "Literary Criticism," lists one contribution to the GM in 1782 and no other. In 1783, however, S. W., i.e. the Reverend Steven Weston, wrote to the GM (Feb., p. 123) asking that somebody explicate lines 31-38 of Battle of Hastings I for him. He particularly wanted to know what lines 33 to 36 meant, especially "to what historical occurrence the author has alluded in these words. Your lovyng wife, who erst dyd rid the londe / Of Lurdanes ." The answer came promptly in the next month's issue (p. 231); T. H. W., i.e. Thomas Holt White, brother of Gilbert White of Selborne, offering the following: Lode ſignifies a courſe; the word remains in Lodeſtone (the magnet uſed in the compaſs); Lodeſtar is the north pole, from Lœdan , Saxon, to lead. Donde his welke , is an obvious metaphor, for 'before the ſetting ſun' or 'before he is fallen below the horizon.' Your loving wife who erſt dyd rid the lende Of * Lurdanes . This paſſage alludes to the expulſion of the Danes, in which, tradition ſays, for it does not appear on record, the women had a principal hand. Hocktide Games (ſee verſe 25) were inſtituted in commemoration of this event, as the Fugalia were amongſt the Romans, on the expulſion of their kings. This exploit is commented on by Spelman in his Gloſſary, and Lye in his edition of Junius's Etymologicum, but theſe accounts are all in Latin; Bayley in his Dictionary mentions Hocktideτ, but takes no notice of the valour of the Saxon women. How Chatterton came to a knowledge of this tradition let thoſe engaged in the controverſy determine. Yours, T. H. W. Professor Taylor's note on the passage (ll. 33-38) reads: "Possible reading: Before yon sun has set, you'll have set your course for good or evil forever. The loving wife and the treasure of you who once rid the land of Lurdanes (see glossary) will fall into the Norman robbers' hands unless, etc. For another possible reading connecting this with the Hocktide games, see 1871 [Skeat's ed.], ii. 337" (II. 828). The definitions of "lode" and of "Lurdanes" were available in N. Bailey's Universal Etymological English Dictionary which had gone through many editions by 1783. But Holt White was the first to comment accurately upon both words as well as the more difficult "Donde his welke" and he was the first, long before Skeat, to connect the passage with the Hocktide Games. But Holt White, as I have shown elsewhere, was a man of considerable erudition. 13</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Cromek, Cunningham, and Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song : A Case of Literary Duplicity by Dennis M. Read</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Hartley Cromek (1770-1812) is best known today as the subject of sardonic rhymes and phrases in the Notebook of William Blake. Blake renamed Cromek "Bob Screwmuch" in one verse and called him "A Petty sneaking Knave" in another. In a couplet elsewhere in his Notebook, Blake proclaimed: "Cr[omek] loves artists as he loves his Meat, | He loves the Art, but 'tis the Art to cheat." 1 Blake's angry words resulted from several disputes between the two men. The first occurred in 1805, when Cromek promised Blake the lucrative job of engraving his designs for Blair's Grave , then reneged, hiring the more fashionable engraver Louis Schiavonetti instead. The second occurred in 1807, when Cromek engaged Thomas Stothard to paint a Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury and Schiavonetti to engrave Stothard's painting, both of which competed with Blake's own. In each enterprise, Blake believed Cromek a double-dealer. 2 In a later enterprise, however, Cromek was himself the victim of double-dealing. In 1810, Cromek edited a collection of ballads purportedly composed by natives of two southern counties of Scotland, Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song (London: Cadell &amp; Davies). Most of those verses, however, were actually composed by the ambitious and enterprising young Scottish poet, Allan Cunningham (1784-1842), a fact which was not broached publicly until 1819, seven years after Cromek's death. Investigating the nature and extent of this duplicity shows the means, the motive, and the opportunity involved in this literary crime and illuminates the rock-ribbed antipathy of Scottish literati toward their southern brethren. On April 12, 1809, Cunningham, then a seventeen-year-old Dumfries stone mason and aspiring poet, wrote to Mrs. Eliza Fletcher (1770-1858) of Edinburgh, "There has been lately a volume added to the Posthumous works of Mr. Burns which I am well aware Madam you will have perused—I mention this that I may tell you there are in the Possession of --- Thomson Esq. of Dumfries a large collection of unpublished letters Poems &amp;c. of Burn's [sic] as many as would form a volume and more." 3 Cunningham is referring to Reliques of Robert Burns , a collection of Burns poems, songs, and letters collected and edited by Cromek and published by Cadell &amp; Davies late in 1808. 4 Cunningham apparently did not know that Mrs. Fletcher had met Cromek in the summer of 1807 during his first trip to Edinburgh and in fact had helped Cromek find some Burns materials and meet some acquaintances and enthusiasts of Burns. Less than six months after Cunningham wrote Mrs. Fletcher, in early August 1809, the two men met in Dumfries, when Cromek arrived with the artist Thomas Stothard; Cromek to find more Burns materials, and Stothard to draw the locales of Burns songs and poems and surviving friends and relatives of Burns for a new and illustrated edition of Burns's works. Cromek carried with him a letter of introduction from Mrs. Fletcher to Cunningham, who was quite pleased to present some samples of his poetry to this London editor. Cunningham's son, Peter Cunningham, later recounted Cromek's verdict on the poetry: ". . . he observed, as I have heard my father tell with great good humour, imitating Cromek's manner all the while, 'Why, Sir, your verses are well, very well; but no one should try to write Songs after Robert Burns unless he could either write like him or some of the old minstrels.'" 5 Cromek's harsh verdict provoked Cunningham. Thus, when Cromek expressed interest in collecting previously unpublished Scottish songs and ballads, Cunningham, acting perhaps more on impulse than malice, asserted that he knew of many. "Gad, Sir!," Cromek responded; "if we could but make a volume—Gad, Sir!—see what Percy has done, and Ritson, and Mr. Scott more recently with his border Minstrelsy" ( Poems and Songs , p. xii). 6 Encouraged by Cromek's enthusiastic outburst, Cunningham presented him with a number of songs on succeeding days, each of them freshly composed the night before. He did not tell Cromek that the songs were his own, however, and Cromek, intent on gathering enough "authentic" compositions to make a volume, did not question Cunningham closely about their origin. On September 18, 1809, shortly before leaving Dumfries, Cromek gave Cunningham a blank book, inscribing specific instructions on its cover: "When this book is filled with old unpublished songs and ballads, and with remarks on them historical and critical, by Allan Cunningham , it must be sent to R. H. Cromek, 64, Newman Street, London . [P] The writer of this knows enough of the last-mentioned gentleman to warrant him in assuring Mr. Cunningham, that his exertions will not only be gratefully acknowledged, but, when an opportunity occurs, kindly returned" ( Poems and Songs , p. xiii). Leaving Cunningham with this encouragement and pledge, Cromek returned to London. From his home there he wrote periodically to Cunningham in Dumfries to spur Cunningham's progress. "How are you getting on with your collection?" he wrote on October 9. "I think between us we shall make a most interesting book" ( Poems and Songs , p. xiii). On the back of this letter Cunningham began composing "Bonnie Lady Anne," which Cromek included in Remains , along with Cunningham's letter about its supposed author, Miss Catherine Macartney of Hacket Leaths, Galloway: "You will be pleased to note down this old song to the muse of Nithsdale and Galloway. She is a gude, sonsie, sweet an' kindlie quean; and tho' she may gang a wee thin 'high kilted' at times, she's gawcie an' modest for a' that, an' winna disgrace your southern gudeness." 7 If Cromek was at all suspicious about the authenticity of the songs Cunningham was sending him, he gave no sign of it in his letters to Cunningham. Perhaps, however, authenticity was less of a concern for him than an appearance of native purity, and he was not above tampering with lyrics in order to achieve this appearance. In his letter of October 27, 1809 to Cunningham, for instance, Cromek objected to a word in a song Cunningham had recently sent to him: "The epithet 'Fell' is a word almost exclusively used by mere cold-blooded classic poets, not by the poets of Nature, and it certainly has crept into the present song through the ignorance of reciters. We must remove it, and its removal must not be mentioned. We'll bury it 'in the family vault of all the Capulets'" ( Poems and Songs , p. xiv). 8 This private decision, however, is quite at odds with Cromek's public declaration in the note to "Lassie, Lie Near Me" he published in Remains : It has been suggested that this song would look better if it were printed Wifie, lie near me . . . . Had not the editor thought that these songs, in their present garb, were worthy of all acceptation, he certainly would not have brought them before the public. He is conscious that he cannot by any attempt at this sort of squeamish delicacy atone for presumption. Who would pardon even Dr. Johnson and his brother commentators, if, instead of illustrating, they had dared to garble the works of the immortal Shakespeare? A licence of this sort, if once assumed, would lead to mischief of incalculable extent; every puny critic would be correcting and altering, until the original text of an author would no longer be known (pp. 190-191n.). Cromek's eloquent espousal of fidelity to the text clearly is a principal he employed only at his convenience. At first Cromek planned to include the songs Cunningham "collected" in a volume also containing a group of Scottish songs accompanied by remarks by Burns and a selection of twenty-five or thirty of the best songs and ballads from Johnson's Musical Museum . Cunningham, however, proved to be so successful in enlarging his inventory of songs and in composing notes to them that Cromek decided to publish the Burns materials separately as Select Scotish Songs, Ancient and Modern ; with critical observations and biographical notices by Robert Burns. The work was published in two octavo volumes by Cadell and Davies in 1810. On February 8, 1810, Cromek wrote Cunningham his plans for their volume: I have now a clear ken of a curious book, on which we can pride ourselves, notwithstanding much criticism , which I plainly see it will get. I have got a famous motto for the book—Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song: with Historical and Traditional Notices relative to the Manners and Customs of the Peasantry, now first published by R. H. Cromek . "We marked each memorable scene, And held poetic talk between; Nor hill, nor brook, we paced along, But had its LEGEND or its SONG: All silent now." ( Poems and Songs , pp. xx-xxi) The motto, which ends in more truth than Cromek knew, was not used; the full title was retained. Cromek does not explain why he expects the volume to be criticized, or why he calls it a " curious book." Perhaps he worried that it was too remote from the interests of the English reading public. Perhaps he thought it might be compared unfavorably with Ritson's or Scott's editions. Or perhaps he wondered if readers would find the songs too rude or rough. Whatever his reasons for his unease, however, he continued to encourage Cunningham's work on it. Mrs. Fletcher expressed her own concerns to Cromek about Cunningham's work on the volume. In a letter dated January 25, 1810, she wrote: "I am very glad you have some favourable prospects for Allan Cunningham.—I believe him to be an excellent young man—but I fear his admiration of ancient ballads will injure his taste. It seems the faculty which he has most need to cultivate[.] His conceptions are often refined but his language is sometimes vulgar.—and he is apt to mistake this for simplicity than which nothing can be more erroneous" (Letter in the National Library of Scotland (2617/65), quoted with permission). Mrs. Fletcher's sensibilities seem more English than Scottish in her concern over the vulgarity of Cunningham's language. Whether or not Cromek shared these sensibilities, he no doubt placed the progress of the volume before the risk of damaging Cunningham's poetic talent. Because Cunningham had sent a sufficient number of songs to Cromek by early 1810, Cromek began encouraging him to come to London, so that the two of them could complete work on the volume together. In his letter of January 27, 1810, Cromek suggested that Cunningham plan to arrive by the beginning of April ( Poems and Songs , pp. xviii-xix). His letters of March 22 and March 28 repeat this encouragement, the last letter including such fatherly advice about the journey as avoiding Edinburgh (except to call on Mrs. Fletcher), finding a room in an inn at Leith, and staying in the principal cabin of the ship ( Poems and Songs , p. xxiii). When Cunningham arrived in London early in April, he was Cromek's guest at his home, where they worked on the final version of Remains . On June 13, Cromek wrote to the Edinburgh publisher Archibald Constable that the task was nearly at its end: You will rejoice with me that my volume of Nithsdale Ballads is on the verge of publication. I wish you had had it, because it should have issued from a Scotch house, and because it is a most curious and original book, and will most certainly have a very wide circulation. I have so high an opinion of it myself, that I think Mr. Jeffrey 9 will and must say it is the most valuable collection that ever yet appeared. I have now given—what I think was never given—the real history of the Scottish Peasantry and as far as relates to the twin districts of Nithsdale and Galloway, I have ventured to describe at some length their manners, attachments, games, superstitions, their traditional history of fairies, witchcraft, &amp;c., &amp;c., taken down from the lips of old cottars. 10 Cromek's Introduction to Remains included an explanation for publishing the collection of songs: "It has been the work of the present collector to redeem some of those fine old ballads and songs, overshadowed by the genius of BURNS; such especially as have never before been published, and are floating in the breath of popular tradition. . . . To those who wish to know how the peasantry think and feel, these Remains will be acceptable. They may be considered as so many unhewn altars raised to rural love, and local humour and opinion, by the GENIUS of unlettered rusticity" (pp. ii-xxvi). Cromek's acknowledgment of Cunningham, however, is limited to a single paragraph in his Introduction: "To Mr. Allan Cunningham, who, in the humble and laborious profession of a mason, has devoted his leisure hours to the cultivation of a genius naturally of the first order, I cannot sufficiently express my obligations. He entered into my design with the enthusiasm of a poet; and was my guide through the rural haunts of Nithsdale and Galloway; where his variously interesting and animated conversation beguiled the tediousness of the toil; while his local knowledge, his refined taste, and his indefatigable industry, drew from obscurity many pieces which adorn this collection, and which, without his aid, would have eluded my research" (pp. xxx-xxxi). Of the fifty-six songs in the volume, Cunningham later acknowledged writing twenty-five, nearly half the total number. He probably wrote many of the others, but perhaps he did not believe they were worth retrieving from the maws of anonymity. He also wrote, in his words, "every article but two little scraps" in the Appendix, which contains eight essays relating to Scottish history and tradition (Hogg, Life , p. 79). Cunningham disguised his authorship of the songs in two ways. The first was to assert that the source of the song was someone else. Cunningham attributed seven of the songs he wrote to "a young girl, in the parish of Kirk-bean, in Galloway," Jean Walker, whom, some years later, Cunningham married. Cromek included in Remains quotations from two alleged letters of hers, including a pithy and dialect-tinged defense of "The Mermaid of Galloway": "How will your old fashioned taste, and the new fangledness of the public's agree about these old Songs?—But tell me, can a song become old when the ideas and imagery it contains are drawn from nature? While gowans grow on our braes, and lilies on our burn-banks, so long will natural imagery and natural sentiment flourish green in song" (p. 247). Cromek knew of Jean Walker only through Cunningham. Another of the seven songs Cunningham attributes to her, "Durwentwater," Cromek has trouble authenticating: "The Editor cannot find any tradition on which this ballad is founded; . . . He has searched for it carefully through all the collections he could meet with, but it is not to be found" (p. 128). In spite of this dearth of collaborative evidence, Cromek published "Durwentwater" as a genuine Scottish folk ballad, as well as the six others supposedly transmitted by Jean Walker. Another important supposed contributor of songs to Remains is Mrs. Copland of Dalbeattie, Galloway. Cromek knew her and in fact dedicated the volume to her. "Mrs. Copland's exquisite taste has rescued from oblivion many fine remains of Song; and has illustrated them by remarks equally curious and valuable," Cromek wrote in his Introduction (p. xxix). Nevertheless, the six songs which are attributed to her, "The Lord's Marie," "Kenmure's on an' Awa, Willie," "Awa, Whigs, Awa!," "Carlisle Yetts," "The Waes O'Scotland," and "The Young Maxwell," were actually composed by Cunningham. It is worth noting that Cunningham's father had been a factor to Mrs. Copland's husband in 1784. Mrs. Copland's niece, Miss Macartney, is listed as the source for two songs in fact composed by Cunningham, "Bonnie Lady Ann" and "The Sun's Bright in France." Two other songs attributed to Miss Macartney were never acknowledged by Cunningham as his own; likewise three others of Mrs. Copland and two others of Jean Walker. Perhaps they are genuine folk ballads, or perhaps Cunningham did not think they were good enough to claim. Cunningham therefore attributed to these three people many songs which he had composed. The most involved manipulation of this modus operandi may have occured in constructing the song, "There's Nane O'Them A'Like My Bonnie Lassie." Cromek's note to the song states: "This old song cost much pains in collecting. The first, second, third, and fifth verses are from the young girl who recited 'Derwent-water' [Jean Walker]. The fourth verse, and part of the sixth, are from Mrs. Copland; the last verses are restored [?by Cunningham] from those ewe-bughting and trysting singings once so common in Nithsdale and Galloway" (p. 92). Although Cunningham never claimed authorship of this song, one wonders if so many people were actively involved in this collaboration and if the "pains" were so great. The second way that Cunningham disguised his authorship was to claim a certain ancestry for it. For instance, Cromek writes of Cunningham's "The Ewe-Bughts,": "This song was communicated to the Editor by his friend Allan Cunningham, who learned it when a boy, from a servant-girl belonging to his father, an honest, cultivated farmer, and acquaintance and neighbor of Burns, when he lived at Ellisland. He never heard any one sing it but herself" (p. 63). Another song Cunningham later admitted was composed by him, "The Gray Cock," Cromek states in Remains Cunningham learned from his father. The remaining songs in the volume either are derived from authentic Scottish songs or contain whole stanzas of songs which had been published in Scots Musical Museum or Ritson's Collection of Scottish Songs . Practically everything in the collection is a result of Cunningham's efforts, but Cromek gives Cunningham scarcely any acknowledgment and poses throughout the volume as the industrious collector, the careful researcher, the scrupulous editor, and the eminent authority of Scottish song. He was in fact a Yorkshireman who had visited Scotland twice in his life. It is no wonder that Cunningham was able to beguile him so completely. Early in October, 1810, Cromek sent pre-publication copies of Remains to two close associates, the Rev. James Graham of Durham, author of "The Sabbath," and James Montgomery of Sheffield, editor of the Sheffield Iris and a well known poet. Montgomery's response to the volume is not known, but Graham's is the kind that Cromek feared. On October 6 Graham answered that the volume contained many pieces which were without merit and which lacked suitable piety. "The book is replenished with gems curiously, fantastically, and often clumsily set," he wrote to Cromek. "Your own part of the work [the Introduction and notes] is spirited and eloquent." 11 This blunted praise no doubt did little to build Cromek's confidence about the public reception of the volume on the eve of its publication. Remains was published simultaneously with Select Scotish Songs in mid-December 1810. Advertisements for both of them appear in the December 13 Morning Chronicle of London. Cromek immediately began sending copies to his important acquaintances. On December 22 he sent one to William Roscoe of Liverpool with a letter mentioning Mrs. Copland, sister of Dr. Macartney of Liverpool. Roscoe, an intimate friend of Burns's first biographer and editor, Dr. James Currie, was acquainted with friends and relatives of Burns and many other Scots, especially those residing in Liverpool. Cromek acknowledged to Roscoe the assistance of Cunningham, who "In making the Collections . . . has served me throughout the whole with the Zeal &amp; Enthusiasm of a true Poet. . . . he has combined the industry of the Winged Mercury with the Genius of Apollo" (Liverpool Public Libraries, quoted with permission). Roscoe playfully answered Cromek in a letter dated January 21, 1811: ". . . where in the name of all that's strange did you get together such a mass of odd matter? So old and so new, and so bawdy and so devout, and so Jacobinical and so pathetic, and in short, so piquant altogether, that one knows not how to get the book out of one's hands till one has laughed, and cried, and wondered what strange sort of a fellow the author, or rather the collector of it (for it does not seem very clear where these two characters separate) can be. . . . if you escape being hanged, drawn, and quartered, for a traitor, the public will, I hope, make you amends for the risk you have run" (Letter in the possession of Mr. Paul Warrington, quoted with permission). Cromek also sent a letter to the wood-engraver Thomas Bewick of Newcastle, dated December 24, 1810, along with the title-page of Remains , "containing," Cromek wrote, "a great deal of valuable traditional Poetry, collected by me while I was last in Scotland, from the mouths of old women, and Country girls in the romantic districts of Nithsdale, and Galloway" (Paul Warrington). In fact the public reception to Remains was good and the reviews complimentary. The January 1811 Universal Magazine describes the volume in glowing terms: The contents of this volume form a subject more than usually interesting to the philosopher and the critic. They are not the matured efforts of labour, study and learning; they are not the offspring of refinement, nor are they executed from any prescribed model: they are the simple, natural, and heart-warm effusions of rustic feeling: they describe those passions which nature plants, nourishes, and expands: they have been written with no expectations of renown; they have floated upon the breath of tradition: the very names of their authors are unknown: and just when the period had arrived that they would probably have died with their possessors, Mr. Cromek has arrested them in their fleeting progress, and has given them a "a [ sic ] local habitation and a name" (p. 37). The January 27, 1811, National Register also reviewed Remains favorably. Even some Scottish readers had praise for the volume. Lord Wood-houselee (Alexander Fraser Tytler) wrote to Cromek on March 2, 1811 that "The Nithsdale Ballads are a valuable present to the public. They open to us a species of Scottish Song of its own peculiar fabric, and with which we, in this part of the country [Edinburgh], are very little acquainted. I mean that which exhibits an intimate union of Love and Religion" (Paul Warrington). And Burns's friend James Gray wrote Cromek on June 3, 1811: "I have read the Nithsdale and Galloway Ballads, with no common interest. Some of them are extremely beautiful. 'The Mermaid' is a production of very high genius, and several of the shorter pieces delight me exceedingly. All of them are in a vein of exquisite poetry. Is it not wonderful that pieces of such uncommon merit should have been doomed so long to obscurity, and that an Englishman should have had the honour of bringing them to light? [¶] Your own share of the work is highly creditable to you. The writing displays all that elegant simplicity that characterises your style in The 'Reliques.' [¶] You are, I think, even improving in style." 12 Other Scottish readers, however, especially those who knew the ballad tradition well, were suspicious of the volume in various ways. The editor Robert Anderson wrote to Bishop Percy on June 22, 1811, "Mr. Cromek has been very successful in his illustrations of popular antiquities and manners; but the genuineness of some of his traditional songs may be reasonably doubted; 'The Mermaid [of Galloway]' particularly, one of the best." 13 Indeed, the song had been composed by Cunningham. Earlier, on December 3, 1810, Walter Scott had written to John Murray, editor of the Quarterly Review , of Cromek: "In his Nithsdale &amp;c. sketches he has I think had the assistance of a Mr. Mounsey Cunningham that used to correspond with Mr. Constable[']s Scottish Magazine under the signature T. M. C. I wish you would learn how this stands for he is a man of some genius and I would like to treat him civilly whereas Cromek is a perfect Brain-sucker living upon the labours of others[.]" 14 Scott confuses Cunningham, whom he would not meet until 1820, with his older brother, Thomas Mounsey Cunningham (1776-1834), a poet who had published some pieces in Scots Magazine in 1806. He later corrected himself on which Cunningham Cromek was exploiting; in his letter to John Bell dated March 7, 1816, he wrote, "There are some good Jacobite songs . . . in a book called Nithsdale and Galloway Minstrelsay [sic] published by one Cromek—the words which are very pretty are by Allan Cunningham as I believe" ( Letters , IV, 191). Other Scottish authorities on native song, and especially those who knew something of Cunningham's work, also suspected the authenticity of many pieces in Remains , although they hesitated from saying so in print. Thus, when Cromek died in 1812, he still may not have known that Cunningham had composed many of the songs in Remains —or at least he believed that the true author of the volume was still secret. The charade was maintained by Cunningham in the "Biographical Sketch of Robert Hartley Cromek" published in the 1813 Grave . At the beginning of his eulogy Cunningham states of Cromek, "Perhaps no Englishman was so well qualified for editing, and particularly for appreciating the curious excellences of Scotish poetry." Seven years after Cromek's death, in 1819, James Hogg finally stated his suspicions publicly in his Jacobite Relics of Scotland (1819). He wrote of "The Waes of Scotland": "This song is copied from Cromek's work, where it first appeared. I am afraid it is not very ancient, as it bears strong marks of the hand of the ingenious Allan Cunninghame, one of the brightest poetical geniuses that ever Scotland bred. . ." (p. 292). Hogg suggested elsewhere in Jacobite Relics that Cunningham also wrote "Lochman Gate" and "Hame, Hame, Hame"; indeed he is correct about all three songs. Later that year, in the December 1819 Blackwood's Magazine , Professor John Wilson wrote directly and at length about Cunningham's role in Remains . Professor Wilson asserted that while "[t]he late Mr Cromek was a man of considerable enthusiasm and ability, . . . he knew little about poetry, and absolutely nothing about the poetry of Scotland. He was precisely that kind of person to believe every thing he was told on that subject—and having a vague notion, that the traditional songs of Scotland were pathetic and beautiful, he was ready to accept, as such, all verses written in the Scottish dialect, that breathed the sentiments and passions of lowly and rural life." Professor Wilson argued of the appendix, "no person of ordinary penetration can for a moment doubt, that as a whole it was fairly composed and written out by the hand of Allan Cunningham." Likewise, "the best of the poetry, too, belongs to Allan Cunningham." And Professor Wilson concluded resoundingly, "can the most credulous person believe, that Mr Cromek, an Englishman, an utter stranger in Scotland, should have been able, during a few days['] walk through Nithsdale and Galloway, to collect, not a few broken fragments of poetry only, but a number of finished and perfect poems, of whose existence none of the inquisitive literary men or women of Scotland had ever before heard?" 15 Wilson's article forcefully claims the form and extent of Cunningham's involvement in Remains . Early in 1820, Cunningham heard a similar claim from Walter Scott when they finally met in London. Scott, Cunningham later wrote, "turned the conversation upon song, and said, he had long wished to know me, on account of some songs which were reckoned old, but which he was assured were mine; 'at all events,' said he, 'they are not old—they are far too good to be old: I dare say you know what songs I mean.'" 16 Shortly thereafter, while Scott sat for Chantrey, who was sculpting a bust of him, Cunningham, Chantrey's secretary since 1814, told Scott the whole story. Later in 1820, Cunningham also wrote to Mrs. Fletcher in Edinburgh confessing his duplicity and asking her advice. She answered in a letter dated November 2, 1820: ". . . I was more amused and interested than [?upset] by your information about the Nithsdale Ballads. It is as curious a literary fact as I ever met with, and I think you owe it to yourself to give it publicity. . . you should simply narrate the feeling that prompted you to this piece of literary imposition—and the less severe you are upon Cromek (who cannot now defend himself) the more readily the public will sympathise with your irritated pride and forgive the harmless manner in which you resented such a provocation." 17 Cunningham published no such admission or explanation as she had advised, but what had previously been suspected about Remains henceforth was translated into received knowledge. When Hogg published the second volume of his Jacobite Relics in 1821, his notes about the authorship of specific songs in Remains were much more blunt: "["The old Man's Lament"] is likewise from Cromek, and very like what my friend, Allan Cunninghame, might write at a venture" (p. 355). "["The Lovely Lass from Inverness"] is from Cromek. Who can doubt that it is by Cunninghame or suppose that such a song really remained in Nithsdale unknown to Burns?" (p. 356). "["Carlisle Yetts"] is from Cromek; and if it is not Allan Cunninghame's, is very like his style" (p. 371). The following year, in 1832, Hogg asserted in his Altrive Tales (1832) not only that Cunningham had composed most of the contents of Remains , but also that he (Hogg) was among the first to realize this fact: When Cromek's "Nithsdale and Galloway Relics" came to my hand [in 1810], I at once discerned the strains of my friend [Cunningham], and I cannot describe with what sensations of delight I first heard Mr. Morrison read the "Mermaid of Galloway," while at every verse I kept naming the author. . . . I continued my asseverations to all my intimate friends, that Allan Cunningham was the author of all that was beautiful in the work . Gray, who had an attachment to Cromek, denied it positively on his friend's authority. Grieve joined him. Morrison, I saw, had strong lurking suspicions; but then he stickled for the ancient genius of Galloway. When I went to Sir Walter Scott (then Mr. Scott,) I found him decidedly of the same opinion as myself; and he said he wished to God we had that valuable and original young man fairly out of Cromek's hands again. I next wrote a review of the work, in which I laid the saddle on the right horse, and sent it to Mr. Jeffrey [of the Edinburgh Review ]; but, after retaining it for some time, he returned it with a note, saying, that he had read over the article, and was convinced of the fraud which had been attempted to be played off on the public, but he did not think it worthy of exposure. I have the article, and card, by me to this day (pp. cxxxiv-cxxxv). After such strong assertions had been advanced by Wilson and Hogg in print, and by Scott in letters and conversation, Cunningham apparently believed that there was no need for him to present in print the true version of the composition of Remains . Rather, he seems to have regarded the matter as settled by 1825, when, in The Songs of Scotland , he simply attributed to himself without comment six songs which first appeared in Remains : "The [Lovely] Lass of Preston Mill," "The Lord's Marie," "Bonnie Lady Ann," "Thou Hast Vow'd by thy Faith, My Jeanie," "The Broken Heart of Annie," and "The Return of Spring." Cunningham included two other songs of his from Remains in his Songs of Scotland , appending to each of them notes which at least indicate his recognition that an explanation was in order. In his note to "The Young Maxwell," Cunningham wrote, "Instead of saying why or when I wrote this song, or telling the reasons that induced me to imitate the natural ballad style of the north, I will tell a little touching story which has long been popular in my native place" (III, 211). Cunningham's story explains why the Scots have such an abiding hatred for the Duke of Cumberland and his soldiers, the theme of "The Young Maxwell." And in his note to "The waes of Scotland," Cunningham wrote: "This song is copied from Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, where it first appeared; it has since found its way into many collections. Mr. Hogg admitted it into the Jacobite Relics, accompanied by such praise of the author as I would rather allude to than quote. It would be uncandid to say such praise is unwelcome; for the praise of a man of original genius will always be considered by the world as an acceptable thing, and I am willing to acknowledge its value" (III, 244). Curiously, however, Cunningham did not attach his name to twelve other songs in Songs of Scotland which originally appeared in Remains : "Stars, dinna peep in," "Awa, whigs, awa," "The Wee Wee German Lairdie," "John Cameron," "Carlisle Yetts," "Derwentwater," "Lament for the Lord Maxwell," "Kenmure's on and awa," "Merry may the keel rowe," "Lassie, lie near me," "Young Airly," and "Galloway Tam." Yet when Cunningham's son, Peter Cunningham, collected his father's verses for Poems and Songs by Allan Cunningham in 1847, he included five of this dozen ("The Wee Wee German Lairdie," "Carlisle Yetts," "Derwentwater," "Lament for the Lord Maxwell," and "Young Airly") in the volume. In his introduction to these Poems and Songs , Peter Cunningham finally presented the true story of the making of Remains . He does not, however, follow Mrs. Fletcher's admonition to his father to be charitable to Cromek. Cunningham's only compensation for his long and sustained labors, according to his son's account, was a copy of the volume and a promise of something more in the future, along with some personal introductions to artists. They visited first John Charles Rossi, then Chantrey, then Charles Bubb, who engaged Cunningham for twenty-six shillings a week. Cunningham remained in Cromek's home for about eight months until nearly the end of 1810, when he was financially able to establish his own separate residence. Cromek therefore unwittingly acted as the perfect dupe for Cunningham, who knew that the editor of Remains could not discern between real Scottish songs and modern imitations of them. In his ignorance, his pomposity, and his brash exploitation of the services and talents of young Allan Cunningham, Cromek served to confirm the notions the Scottish held generally about the English. Cunningham certainly must have believed that his forgeries of Scottish ballads were not nearly so blameworthy as Cromek's wholesale acceptance of them. Cromek had told Cunningham, as he had told Blake about his Grave designs, that he would be richly rewarded for his efforts. When Cunningham wound up with nothing more than a volume of his imitations and a servile position in London, he must have felt he was the victim of his own deception and Cromek the victor. In fact, Cunningham could not have emerged a winner in his scheme. If he had hoped that Cromek would be exposed as a bogus expert on Scottish song, he would have needed to depend upon critics publicly pointing out the fraudulent dimensions of Remains . Instead, English reviewers seem to have been taken in as much as Cromek, and Scottish reviewers (or, in the case of the Edinburgh Review , a Scottish editor) refrained from questioning the authenticity of the volume. In a letter to his brother, James, dated September 8, 1810, Cunningham wrote that Cromek's example showed that "a man may talk about the thing he does not understand, and be reckoned a wise fellow too" (Hogg, Life , pp. 79-80). It remained for Cunningham to establish himself as a poet, biographer, and journalist of the fine arts in other, more conventional ways.</field>

Allan Cunningham wrote Thomas Cromek on July 19, 1833, "The last time almost I had a conversation with Mr. Cromek he felt a little angry with the world for not perceiving the merits of the Vol. [ Remains ] and talked of publishing the letters, with the opinions of the cleverest men of the age, only, he said, to show the public what an ass it was" (quoted in "Memorials"). Cunningham's recollection is curious, since his authorship of most of what was in Remains was well known by the time he wrote Cromek's son. 13 Quoted in James Bowyer Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century (1848), VII, 215. 14 Letters of Sir Walter Scott , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">Dates for Some Serially Published Shakespeares by Richard Knowles *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lavishly illustrated mid-nineteenth-century Bibles, histories of England, and editions of Shakespeare and other literary classics that helped build the fortunes of publishers like Harper's and Cassell's lent themselves well to serial publication in parts because of the time and expense needed for preparing hundreds, sometimes even more than a thousand, of their exquisitely detailed end-grain wood or steel engravings. Regular publication of serial parts in paper wrappers ensured both adequate preparation time and a steady supply of capital. Several editions of Shakespeare produced in this way proved to be important ones, influential not only because their attractiveness made them very popular but also because their editors, generally not professional scholars as authoritative as Dyce, Halliwell, or Wright, were nonetheless acute and dedicated amateur Shakespeareans as well as gifted authors in their own right. Any New Variorum edition of a Shakespeare play is sure to contain dozens of original, useful comments by such editors as Charles Knight, Howard Staunton, and Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke. These editions pose a problem for historical scholars in that they are difficult to date accurately. After being issued in parts they were usually bound into volumes, both by the publishers for sale as bound sets and privately by owners of the individual parts, and in either case with title pages provided by the publishers from time to time in the paper-bound numbers. Even if the original paper wrappers were dated, they were discarded in binding, and the title pages and copyright pages of the bound volumes bear dates (if these appear at all) later than the dates of original issue of most of the parts. Library catalogues are more likely than not to give the later dates of the bound volumes, so that one is puzzled to find Alexander Dyce in his Strictures (1859) quoting from Staunton's volume of Shakespeare's Tragedies , whose date appears on title page and in catalogues as 1860. Even if a catalogue card does give inclusive dates for an earlier serial publication, these are of no help in finding date of issue of individual parts, which may have been published in a different order than that found in the bound volumes. The result is that it is sometimes impossible to know whom to credit as the first author of a comment or criticism, or to say who influenced whom. This essay attempts from various kinds of evidence to reconstruct the order and timetable of printing of five of the most important serially issued Shakespeares, four of them popular illustrated editions and one of them sold privately by limited subscription.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Charles Knight, ed. The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere . 8 vols. [1839-43]. Serially issued in 55 parts, 1838-43. With its hundreds of engravings by W. Harvey, G. F. Sargent, and others this edition surpassed in the extent of its illustration such earlier editions as Boydell's and Valpy's, and was much imitated in succeeding years; moreover, it is textually better than any previous edition. Because of the (often extreme) adherence to the First Folio of 1623 on the part of its editor, the prolific author and publisher Charles Knight (1791-1873), this edition's text restores many correct Folio readings and gets rid of much 18th-century punctuation. The commentary is extensive and intelligent. Many library catalogues, including those of the British Library and the Birmingham Shakespeare Library, make no note of serial publication. The initial catalogue date for the bound sets derives from the "Preface," dated 18 May 1839, to Vol. I of the Histories , the first volume to be published; the closing date comes from the eighth volume to be published, William Shakspere: A Biography , which has a letter-press title page dated 1842 and an engraved one dated 1843. Since, as can be seen from the timetable below, Knight was concurrently publishing separate parts of histories, comedies, and tragedies, the intervening bound volumes appear in apparently random order: Vol. I of the Comedies (1839), Vol. I of the Tragedies (1840), Vol. II of the Histories (1840), Vol. II of the Comedies (1841), Vol. II of the Tragedies (1841; in vols. that include the Poems , 1842), and Doubtful Plays (1843). Several years ago in a dittoed note distributed to editors of the New Variorum Shakespeare and on file at the Folger Library, T. W. Baldwin attempted to reconstruct the sequence and dates of publication for the separate parts, using dates of accession jotted in a British Library bound set. On the whole his dating is correct, but there are some errors, and an unbound set of the separately issued parts in their original wrappers, owned by the Folger Library, makes an exact dating a very simple matter. Although there is some inconsistency from one part to another, the title and date for each part (i.e., for each play, since each part contained a whole play) appear printed on the front or back cover and/or announced inside the front cover of the previously published part. Not all these dates specify the first of the month as the date of issue, but Knight himself, in his "Postscript to the Sixth Volume" ( Tragedies II), dated 21 December 1841, wrote, "It is now somewhat more than three years since I commenced the publication of 'The Pictorial Edition of Shakspere,' in Monthly Parts; and during that period I have produced a Part on the first day of each month, with one single exception." A "Prospectus" on the back cover of Part 1 predicts 44 parts in 6 volumes (2 vols. of Comedies, 1 of Histories, 2 of Tragedies, and 1 of Poems and Life); by 1 Apr. 1839 ( 1H4 ) the prediction had changed to 2 vols. of Histories, 7 vols. in all, and a later decision to publish Doubtful Plays ( Tit. , Per. , TNK , and others) resulted in 8 vols. The "Prospectus" also gives a kind of explanation of the sequence of publication: in order to "exhibit the growth of the Poet's mind," "the Comedies and Tragedies will be published, as nearly as can be ascertained, in the order in which they were written, but in separate classes; and the Histories according to the order of events. Whilst this arrangement is preserved with reference to the completion of the work in volumes, a necessary variety will be offered in the periodical publication of Plays taken from each of the three classes." That sequence is as follows: 1838: Pt. 1, Nov., TGV ; 2, Dec., Jn . 1839: Pt. 3, Jan., Rom. ; 4, Feb., LLL ; 5, Mar., R2 ; 6, Apr., 1H4 ; 7, May, 2H4 ; 8, June, H5 ; 9, July, Wiv. ; 10, Aug., Ham. ; 11, Sept., Err. ; 12, Oct., Shr. ; 13, Nov., MND ; 14, Dec., MV 1840: Pt. 15, Jan., Cym. ; 16, Feb., Oth. ; 17, Mar., Tim. ; 18, Apr., Lr. ; 19, May, AWW ; 20, June, 1H6 ; 21, July, 2H6 ; 22, Aug., 3H6 ; 23, Sept., R3 ; 24, Oct., H8 ; 25, Oct., Intro. to Vol. II of Histories (an Essay on 1-3H6 and R3 ); 26, Nov., Ado ; 27, Dec., TN 1841: Pt. 28, Jan., AYL , P.S. to TN ; 29, Feb., MM ; 30, Mar., WT ; 31, Apr., Mac. ; 32, May, Tmp. ; 33, June, Tro. ; 34, July, Cor. ; 35, Aug., JC ; 36, Sept., Ant. ; 37, Oct., Poems I ( Ven. , Luc. ); [hiatus, Nov.]; 38, Dec., Poems II ( Son. ) 1842: Pt. 39, Jan., Poems III ( LC , PP ; Suppl. Notice to Roman Plays); 40, Feb., Tit. ; 41, Mar., Per. ; 42, Apr., TNK ; 43, May, and 44, June, Essay on Plays Ascribed to Sh.; 45-49, July-Nov., Biography; 50, Dec., History of Opinion 1843: Pt. 51, Jan., Sh. in Germany, Index; 52, Mar., Biography; 53, May, Biog.; 54-55, July-Aug., Biog. Incidentally, the Folger holdings reveal that this edition exists in two states. In the first state, that found in the parts in paper wrappers and in some bound sets, the footnotes to the plays are keyed to asterisks, daggers, double daggers, and the like; in the later state found in other bound sets, the notes are identified by a, b, c, etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Gulian C. Verplanck, ed. The Illustrated Shakespeare . 3 vols. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1847. Serially issued in 138 (?) parts, 1844-47. This handsome crown-quarto edition illustrated with some fourteen hundred engravings had a complicated publishing history, including a change of publishers and two printing-house fires. It was originally undertaken by the little-known New York engraver H. W. Hewet, apparently the publisher of Hewet's Excelsior New York Illustrated Times (1846) and Hewet's Illuminated Household Stories for Little Folks (n. d.). As Verplanck frankly admits in his "Preface" of 1847 (1:v), the edition was conceived in open imitation of two recent English illustrated Shakespeares, from which most if not all of its engravings are copied: Knight's edition (above), and that of "Barry Corn-wall" [pseud. Bryan Waller Procter], issued serially 1839-43 and in three bound volumes (London: R. Tyas, 1844), whose original illustrations by Kenny Meadows make up the bulk of those imitated by Hewet. To do the editorial work Hewet invited the New York lawyer, congressman, essayist, educator, and amateur Shakespearean scholar Gulian C. Verplanck (1786-1870). Verplanck based his text on John Payne Collier's recent edition of 1842-44, frequently (following Knight) restoring First Folio readings and occasionally adopting original conjectures. His commentary is largely a selection from the 1821 Variorum and the editions of Collier, Knight, and Samuel Weller Singer, amplified with many shrewd and sensible comments of his own, and he supplied an ample introduction to each play emphasizing especially Shakespeare's development as an artist. While this is a derivative edition and not of the first importance, it is yet a very good edition, and its generous, well-informed, and often original commentary and its handsome illustrations might have made it a more popular and influential one but for an accident, noted by Charles P. Daly in his memorial address before the Century Club, April 9, 1870 ( Gulian C. Verplanck , 1870, p. 59): "It is much to be regretted that the plates of this excellent edition were shortly afterward destroyed by fire. Being a very costly work, it was not reproduced, and it consequently never became as extensively known as it deserved to be." In all Hewet published 38 weekly parts in 1844, each consisting of 16 pages, printed on two sheets folded into two quarto gatherings and bound together in paper covers. Unlike the parts in the Knight edition, each of these contained only a portion of a play, or in many cases the ending of one play and the beginning of the next. Hewet completed ten plays and part of an eleventh, then transferred publication of the edition to Harper's while continuing to do the engraving up to the end of the series. The Folger Library owns a complete set of Hewet's 38 parts; although undated they are numbered, and from occasional announcements on the back covers it is possible to reconstruct the publication timetable fairly accurately. Journal notices of the new edition (see below) began to appear in the spring of 1844. A notice on the covers of Nos. 5, 6, and 7 affirms the publisher's utmost efforts to get copies to "his most remote Agents" "on Friday each week," evidently for regular publication on Saturday. A notice in No. 4 announces that, the initial printing of 10,000 copies having been "disposed of" in response to popular demand, Hewet will have to "remove and increase his establishment" and so defer publication of No. 5 "until the 27th inst." The earliest month in 1844 when a fifth part could have been published on a Saturday the 27th is April. No. 37 advertises, clearly for the Christmas season, "A Splendid Holiday Present for Children. To Be Published on Wednesday, 11th inst. The Life of Christ!" In December 1844 the 11th of the month fell on Wednesday, so that No. 37 would presumably have been published on the previous Saturday, 7 December. If No. 5 had been published on 27 April and successive parts had appeared regularly each week, No. 37 would have been published on 7 December; the dates of Saturday, 27 April, and Wednesday, 11 December, thus confirm each other and establish a regular weekly publication schedule for most of 1844. Assuming that Hewet's move in April from 236 Broadway to 11 Spruce Street did not take more than a week or so, we may conclude that No. 1 was published in mid-March, probably on the 23rd or the Saturday before. No. 38, Hewet's last, must have appeared in December since it bears the same Christmas advertisement as No. 37. Thus the part of Verplanck's edition published by Hewet may be dated as follows: 1844: Pts. 1-5, Mar.-Apr., Ham. ; 5-8, Apr.-May, Mac. ; 9-12, May-June, Oth. ; 13-16, June-July, Wiv. ; 16-20, July-Aug., Rom. ; 20-24, Aug.-Sept., Lr. ; 24-28, Sept.-Oct., Cym. ; 29-31, Oct., MV ; 32-34, Nov., Err. ; 34-37, Nov.-Dec., Shr. ; 37-38, Dec., TGV (incomplete) Two journal notices support this timetable: the May issue of The Columbian Magazine , whose copy would have been written in April, announces (1:238) that three "weekly Issues" of "Hewet's Shakspeare" have so far appeared, comprising most of the text of Hamlet , and the July issue of The Knickerbocker (24:102) notes that (as of June, when copy was written) twelve numbers have appeared. Early in 1845 the publication was taken over by Harper's. The United States Magazine and Democratic Review announces in its March issue (16: 310), "Harpers have resumed the publication of the 'Illustrated Shakspeare,' edited by Verplanck," and the New York weekly The Anglo American for 1 March (4:451) notes receipt of review copies of "Double No. xxxix and xl. . . . This work has passed from the hands of the publishers who commenced, and will be completed by the Harpers. . . . The numbers before us consist of the concluding portion of 'The Two Gentlemen of Verona' and the commencement of 'The Winter's Tale'." I have not been able to find a complete set of the unbound parts of the plays published by Harper's: the Folger Library owns a few early parts without covers; the New York Public Library owns a single part of 2H4 misbound in a cover for Rom. ; the Boston Public Library owns parts for most of the plays, unfortunately cut apart and rebound, sometimes in original wrappers, to form whole plays; and the Library of Congress owns Nos. 63-82 and 93-130 of the issues originally submitted by Harper's for copyright, about half of them misbound in the wrong covers and all of them bearing the clerk of the court's notations of dates when batches of these parts were deposited. In the Copyright Record Books of the District Courts, 1790-1870, now held at the Library of Congress, that for the New York Southern District court, Sept. 1844 to July 1845, records on 6 June 1845 (147:485) a claim of copyright for "Harper's Illuminated and Illustrated Shakespeare," and at the bottom of the page the clerk has noted from time to time when the parts were actually deposited, as follows: Parts 1-54, 6 June 1845; 55-60, 19 July; 61-70, 18 Oct.; 71-74, 10 Feb. 1846; 75-76, 14 Apr.; 77-90, 3 July; 91-108, 3 Sept.; and 109-134, 11 Mar. 1847. Since on most of these dates (or on the previous day) Harper's entered other copyright claims at the court, and since the dates always agree with those written on the actual parts deposited for copyright, these jottings are accurate. On 17 Feb. 1847 (150:1556) the clerk records Harper's application for ownership of "the title of a Book," to wit Verplanck's edition issued in three volumes under the new title Shakespeare's Plays ; as will appear below, the edition was not yet complete, and there is no record that the volumes were ever deposited. The book notices in The Anglo American , the New York journal which appeared every Saturday, record publication of many parts of the edition. Since in several cases these notices occur a week or more after a part was deposited for copyright, I infer that Harper's regularly issued its parts near the end of the week, too late for them to be noticed in Saturday's review column, and so I regularly assume publication about a week before these journal notices. From the evidence listed above and from the numbering of quires in both serial parts and the 1847 edition, I have been able to reconstruct a schedule of publication of the parts of Verplanck's Shakespeare issued by Harper's. On the back of the Romeo and Juliet wrapper in the New York Public Library is printed this notice: "The thirty-eight numbers already issued by H. W. Hewet are sold at twelve-and-a-half cents each: those hereafter to be published will contain at least double the quantity of matter, and will be sold at twenty-five cents each. They will be issued at intervals of about two weeks by the subscribers, from whom back numbers may be procured. New York, February 15, 1845. HARPER &amp; BROTHERS." Evidently Harper's was reissuing Hewet's back stock in its own newly printed wrappers; perhaps some of the former numbers had been or were being reprinted by Harper's, since for some early numbers Hewet had run through his original printing of 10,000. Harper's must have commenced publication of new numbers within a week or ten days of the notice of 15 February, since by 1 March The Anglo American (see above) had received Harper's first double Number, 39-40. Harper's immediately abandoned Hewet's practice of randomly publishing comedies and tragedies, and instead from February into early October concentrated on finishing the comedies, presumably to allow owners of the parts to have them bound into a single volume of Comedies. The schedule as I have worked it out is as follows: 1845: Pt. 39, Feb., TGV (completed); 40-43, Feb.-Mar., WT ; 43-46, Mar.-Apr., Ado ; 46-49, Apr.-May, LLL ; 49-52, May, TN ; 52-[56], May-June, AYL ; [56]-[59], June-July, MND ; [59]-62, July-Aug., MM ; 62-65, Aug.-Sept., Tmp. ; 65-69, Sept.-Oct., AWW Production slowed somewhat during the summer, when the double parts appeared at longer than bi-weekly intervals on the average. Up through No. 50 Harper's continued Hewet's format of two sheets (two eight-page quires) per numbered part, so that Harper's semi-monthly double parts included 32 pages of text. Halfway through Twelfth Night , from No. 51 onward, the format changes to 36 pages per double part, three twelve-page quires of quarto-in-six. These quires are signed (or numbered) consecutively throughout the rest of the edition, beginning with quires 68, 69, and 70 in No. 51-52. Apparently the numbering begins at 68 because the 800 pages of the edition already printed can be considered approximately the equivalent of 67 of the new twelve-page quires; probably Harper's was anticipating the possibility of a later reprint of the edition entirely in twelve-page gatherings. In all bound volumes of the Comedies that I have seen the quires are a mixture of those of eight pages (for plays issued before TN ) and those of twelve pages (for plays issued afterwards). The new format of 36 pages per double part was apparently intended to be the norm from now on, since it is approximately the same number of pages as in the 32-page format of Harper's previous issues and fulfills Harper's promise of three months before to provide "at least double the quantity of matter" in Hewet's single parts. Nonetheless, the parts extant in the Library of Congress reveal that about every third issue was a smaller one consisting of only two quires and 24 pages. I am assuming that the first issue in the new format, No. 51-52, immediately set the norm and consisted of three quires and 36 pages; however, irregularities begin almost immediately, and the uncertainty that results for parts whose exemplars I have been unable to see is reflected in the bracketed numbers in the chart above. The Library of Congress's series of extant parts begins with No. 63-64 (quires 84-86); if, as I assume, the last quire in No. 51-52 was quire 70, then the ten intervening parts, Nos. 53-62, consist of thirteen rather than the fifteen quires regularly to be expected, and thus two of these intervening double Numbers are short a quire. In the Anglo American notices and on original printed wrappers in the Boston Public Library collection, issue numbers are linked with play titles as follows: Nos. 53-54 and 55-56, AYL ; Nos. 57-58 and 59-60, MND ; No. 61-62, MM ; No. 63-64, Tmp. Doubtless some of these issues contain pages from a play beside the one named on the wrapper, but from the assumption that an issue is likely to bear the title of the play printed on the majority of its pages, I deduce that Nos. 53-54 and 57-58 were the short issues, consisting of quires 71-72 and 76-77 respectively. The conjectural division of plays among parts in the table above reflects this conclusion; in any case, other possible divisions are not likely to make any difference in the month(s) of issue of each play as a whole. The order of comedies in the bound volumes, as indicated by a Contents page supplied in 1847, is TGV, Err., Shr., Ado, LLL, MV, Wiv., TN, AYL, MND, MM, Tmp., AWW, WT ; this is neither the order of publication nor the order of composition described by Verplanck in his essay "Order of the Plays" (1:xi-xvi), but a compromise, approaching as nearly as possible to Verplanck's chronology without the necessity of cutting apart quires in order to separate plays printed on conjugate pages. Cymbeline, Troilus , and Pericles are included among the Tragedies, in the next volume. The first pages of Tim. share No. 69-70 with the last pages of AWW , and Harper's clearly intended now to complete the remaining tragedies; but two lengthy interruptions of printing attest to difficulties complicating that process. No. 69-70 appeared in mid-October, with the beginning pages of Tim. in quires 92-94; the rest of Tim. is delayed a month and a half until early December ( Anglo American , 20 Dec., 6:212), in quires 95-96 of No. 71-72. I know of no reason for this hiatus. A short time later occurs another delay in printing, this time of more than three months. On 27 Dec. Anglo American (6:236) announces No. 73-74, Coriolanus (quires 98-99), but not until 11 April the next year does it notice (6:597) No. 75-76 (which was deposited for copyright on 14 April), and another month passes before it notices (9 May, 7:71) the appearance of No. 77-78. The reason for the long delays in early 1846 is given in the notice of 11 April: "We are happy to observe that this truly elegant edition . . . has been resumed by Messrs. Harpers: the delay having been caused by the loss of plates at the late fire." Perhaps to make up for lost time, Harper's doubled its rate of production shortly thereafter: as is clear from notices two or three times a month in Anglo American , from June 13 through September Harper's without fail published a double Number every week, at the end of which time they had completed more than half of the third and last volume, the Histories. The probable schedule of publication for those tragedies not previously published by Hewet is as follows: 1845: Pts. 69-72, Oct.-Dec., Tim. ; 72-74, Dec., Cor. (incomplete) 1846: Pt. 75, Apr., Cor. (completed); 76-79, JC , Apr.-May; 79-83, May-June, Ant. ; 83-87, June, Tro. ; 87-90, June-July, Tit. ; [90]-93, July, Per. The Library of Congress owns most of these parts but lacks Nos. 83-92 (quires 111-123). Since here again a run of ten parts includes only thirteen rather than fifteen quires, the distribution of these quires among the double Numbers is uncertain. Since previously there have never been two short issues in succession, and since the ends of Tro. and Tit. make convenient breaking points, I conjecture that the two short issues (two quires, 24 pages) are Nos. 85-86 (quires 114-115) and 89-90 (quires 119-120). Two bits of evidence may give some slight support to this conjecture. In noticing No. 87-88, Anglo American (4 July 1846, 7:262) discourses on the lack of literary merit of its play, Titus Andronicus ; if the majority of pages in this issue are from Tit. , it must consists of at least quires 117 and 118, and for that to be possible no more than one of the two numbers preceding it could have been short numbers. In its next issue (11 July, 7:285) Anglo American does not name the play title(s) of No. 89-90 but singles it out for special praise for its illustrations "by the magic pencil of Kenny Meadows and the graver of Hewet"; this description fits well with the two quires I have conjectured for this number, since quire 119 has a higher number of engravings than usual, and quire 120 contains the full-page frontispiece engraving for Per. Such evidence gives only the slightest support at best, and in any case other possible divisions of the quires can make virtually no difference in the month of issue of these plays. The last of the "tragedies," Per. , shares a quire with the beginning of Jn. , and the histories, none of which Hewet had published, now follow in order of reign. Through September Harper's maintained a rate of production of a double Number every week. From October until the completion of H8 in early 1847, production slowed to about a double Number every two weeks. The Anglo American for 9 Jan. 1847 (8:286) announces No. 129-130, which ends exactly with the completion of H8 , and on 6 Feb. (8:382) it describes the next Number, 131-132, as containing Rowe's Life , part of the introductory matter intended to be bound in the Histories volume. The probable timetable of publication for the histories is as follows: 1846: Pts. 93-96, July, Jn. ; 97-99, Aug., R2 ; 100-103, Aug., 1H4 ; 104-107, Aug.-Sept., 2H4 ; 107-111, Sept., H5 ; 111-114, Sept., 1H6 ; 115-118, Oct., 2H6 ; 118-121, Oct.-Nov., 3H6 ; 121-126, Nov. [-Dec.?], R3 ; 126-128, [Nov.-?] Dec., H8 (incomplete) 1847: Pts. 129-130, Jan., H8 (completed) With the completion of H8 there remained to be published 120 pages of introductory matter, mainly Rowe's Life and a longer biography of Shakespeare abridged from Collier's edition. Since I know of no surviving serial parts containing this material, I can only conjecture their number and format. As of 11 Mar. the copyright records list the deposit of parts only through 134, i.e. through two regular double Numbers after H8 , but at least three issues of introductory matter are noticed by Anglo American , on 6 Feb. (8: 382), 20 Feb. (8:430), and 27 Mar. (8:550; "the concluding issue"), each of which must have appeared a week or so earlier, and in all likelihood one or even two others must have appeared in late February or early March. If these were issued in something like the previous format (double issues of either two or three quires), there are only two possibilities: five issues of 24 pages, concluding with No. 139-140, or four issues, two of 36 pages and two of 24, concluding with No. 137-138. Since 36-page issues are preponderant in the edition and 24-page issues the exception, the latter possibility seems the more likely. I assume that the title pages, table of contents, and Verplanck's Preface and essay on the "Order of the Plays" were printed last; since the quires (A and B) containing these preliminaries, together with the final four-page quire K, comprise 24 pages, I think it very likely that these made up the final, short issue, No. 137-138. I conjecture that the 120 introductory pages appeared as follows: 1847: Pts. 131-136, late Jan.-Feb. or early Mar., Biographical introductions (quires C-J); 137-138, Mar., Preliminary matter (quires K, A, and B). The publication of the edition in three volumes under the new title Shakespeare's Plays may have occurred some two or three months after its copyright entry of 17 Feb. 1847. It certainly did not appear before its completion in mid-March, and had probably appeared at least by May, since The Knickerbocker announces its appearance in its June issue (29:580) and reviews it in July (30:77-78).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Howard Staunton, ed. Plays of Shakespeare . 3 vols. 1858-60. Serially issued in 50 parts, 1856-60. Besides being an internationally renowned chess master and author on chess, Howard Staunton (1810-74) produced this complete edition of Shakespeare's plays and in later years a score of articles in which he turned his acute and logical mind to problems of textual emendation in Shakespeare. This edition, with its conservative text, full commentary, selections from critics, and more than eight hundred original illustrations by Sir John Gilbert, was still considered handsome and useful enough in 1979 to be reprinted in a one-volume facsimile and sold widely to a popular readership. The three bound volumes were issued by Routledge in 1858, 1859, and 1860, each when enough of the individually issued parts had appeared to make up a volume. In his own Preface (1:xiv), dated April 1860, Staunton by lapse of memory makes the erroneous remark that has misled later cataloguers and bibliographers: "The present work was begun in Nov. 1857, and has been published month by month in parts up to the first of May, 1860." In fact, as will be seen below, publication of parts began a year earlier in December 1856. Providing a publication timetable for the edition is a relatively simple matter, since unbound parts survive in their original green paper wrappers; the majority of these are numbered and dated, and since publication was regular, one issue per month, the intervening dates may easily be inferred, the only irregularity being that three or four times a year Routledge issued double Numbers. I am grateful that to my original timetable, reconstructed from an incomplete set of parts at the Folger Library and from scattered issues in the University of Wisconsin Memorial Library, Professor John Hazel Smith contributed confirming and supplementary information from his own complete set of parts. The plays were issued in a very rough approximation of their order of composition. The order of publication of parts is also the order of appearance in the bound volumes, since, as was the case with Verplanck's edition, most of the parts contain pages of two and in some cases three different plays, so that changing the order in binding would have required much cutting apart of quires. In some parts appear title pages and other preliminary matter for the bound volumes, along with inserted printed instructions for the binder. Inside the front paper cover of No. 1 is the announcement, "To be published monthly, in shilling parts [25 cents in the United States]. On the 1st of December, 1856, will be issued . . . the first Part of a new . . . Edition . . . by Howard Staunton." All dates given in brackets in the following timetable are inferred. Vol. I. Issued in parts 1856-7; title page dated 1858. 1856: Pt. 1, [Dec.], TGV, LLL (incomplete) 1857: Pts. 2-3, [Jan.-Feb.], LLL (completed); 3-4, [Feb.-Mar.], Err. ; 4-5, [Mar.]-Apr., Rom. ; 5-6, Apr.-May, Shr. ; 6-7, May-[June], Jn. ; 8-9, [June]-July, MND ; 9-10, July-Aug., MV ; 10-11, Aug.-Sept., R2 ; 11-12, Sept.-[Oct.], 1H4 ; 12-14, [Oct.]-Nov., 2H4 ; 14-15, Nov.-[Dec.], Wiv. ; 15-16, [Dec.], Ado The double parts are 7-8 [June], 12-13 [Oct.], and 15-16 [Dec.]. Vol. II. Issued in parts 1858; title page dated 1859. 1858: Pt. 17, Jan., AWW ; 17-19, Jan.-Mar., H5; 19-20, Mar.-[Apr.], AYL ; 20-21, [Apr.], Per. ; 21-22, [Apr.]-May, TN ; 22-23, May-June, 1H6 ; 23-24, June, 2H6 ; 24-26, June-Aug., 3H6 ; 26-27, Aug.-Sept., Tim. ; 27-28, Sept., R3 ; 28-29, Sept.-Oct., MM ; 30-31, Nov.-Dec., H8 ; 31-32, Dec., Cym.

Issued in parts 1859-60; title page dated 1860. 1859: Pt. 33, Jan., Tmp. ; 34-35, Feb.-Mar., Lr. ; 35-36, Mar., Cor. ; 37-38, Apr.-May, WT ; 38-39, May-June, Tro. ; 39-41, June-Aug., Ham. ; 41-42, Aug.-Sept., JC ; 42-43, Sept.-Oct., Mac. ; 43-45, Oct.-Nov., Ant. ; 45-46, Nov.-Dec., Tit. ; 46, Dec., Oth.

The double parts are 35-36 (Mar.), 44-45 (Nov.), and 49-50 (May). The bound copies in the Folger Library represent both volumes in trade bindings offered by the publisher and others privately bound. In the latter sets the accessory matter in No. 49-50 is bound variously at the end of Vol. III, following order of publication, or at the beginning of either Vol. I or Vol. III. Many library catalogues date their sets 1858-61, and these are also given as the original dates in the 1979 reprint, but so far as I can tell the pages in the 1858-60 and 1858-61 sets are identical.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke, eds. The Plays of Shakespeare . Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare. 3 vols., n. d. Serially issued in 270 weekly parts, 1864-69. Richard Altick in The Cowden Clarkes (1948, pp. 199, 201), calling this "probably the most sumptuous edition of Shakespeare ever prepared for the popular market," says of it, "Altogether, it was a fortunate Victorian home whose parlour boasted [its] three heavy volumes," and names Francis Thompson and George Bernard Shaw as two Victorian sons known to have discovered Shakespeare in these crown-quarto volumes attractively illustrated by the painter H. C. Selous. Unlike Knight, Verplanck, and Staunton, the Cowden Clarkes were well known Shakespeareans when they undertook this edition. Charles Cowden Clarke (1787-1877), friend of Keats, Lamb, Hunt, Shelley, Hazlitt, and Dickens, bookseller, publisher, author, and editor of English classics, was especially famous for his immensely popular lectures on Shakespeare, delivered from 1834 to 1856 and published as Shakespeare-Characters (1863). Mary Victoria Novello Clarke (1809-1898) had already produced her Concordance to Shakespeare (1844-45), The Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines (1851-52), and, as Shakespeare's first woman editor (though aided by her husband), a complete Works issued in New York by Appleton in fortnightly parts, 1859-60. Their Cassell's edition is valuable not for its text—as required by Cassell's, they produced a "chastened" (expurgated) text, and on their own convictions omitted Titus altogether—but for a commentary approaching a Variorum's in fullness. The indefatigable Clarkes commented on thousands of words and passages left untouched by previous editors, sometimes pointing out Shakespeare's beauties and points of artistry and subtleties of characterization, often in a moralizing way but usually with knowledge, good sense, originality, and independence of judgment; the majority of the notes, however, are linguistic, employing sometimes to excess Mary's method of cross-reference and comparison to parallel passages in Shakespeare. Though seldom brilliant, their commentary is painstaking and sensible, and it has been widely assimilated by Furness, William J. Rolfe, and W. J. Craig and other early editors in the Arden edition. Their edition remained popular and was reprinted a number of times to the end of the century. Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare, whose three bound volumes bear no dates, has never been dated correctly. Altick (p. 254) says erroneously that it was "issued in weekly parts, February 1864 to March 1868, and then in three volumes." He was misled by Mary Clarke's own statement in My Long Life (1897, p. 160): "We began the work on the 1st of September. It was rather an anxious task, as we had to 'work to time.' The edition was originally brought out in weekly numbers; but we never failed once in regular presupply of the requisite matter for the printers. . . . We finished our annotated edition on the 16th March, 1868, and began our "Shakespeare Key" two days after." But of course her dates are for the writing, not the publishing of the edition; significantly, in a list of Works appended to her Centennial Biographic Sketch of Charles Cowden Clarke (1887) she dates the edition simply 1869, the year when it was in fact completed. In its American issue the edition appeared in thirty parts averaging nine sheets each; the Folger Library owns a set of these parts, all of them unfortunately undated. In W. A. Wright's papers in Trinity College Library, Cambridge, is a letter from Cassell's to Wright dated 31 January 1885 describing the edition's publication in England: Dear Sir, The edition of Shakespeare to which you refer was issued by us in 270 weekly numbers, and 61 monthly parts. The first weekly number was published in February 1864, and the last about April 1869. Since I have never run across a set of either the weekly numbers or monthly parts, I have had to reconstruct the approximate schedule of publication from journal notices, particularly dated notices in The Bookseller , and from the numbering of the sheets in the bound volumes. Each weekly part was a sheet folded into four crown-quarto leaves, with at least one page given wholly or mainly to an engraved illustration; these sheets are each numbered consecutively in the lower right corner of the first page. Vol. I, Comedies, is sheets 1-91; Vol. II, Histories, is sheets 92-166; Vol. III, Tragedies, is sheets 167-269; quire 270 is a pair of sheets including title-page and prefatory matter. At a regular rate of one sheet a week, 270 sheets would have taken 5 years and 2 months to publish; if begun in February 1864 the edition would have been completed by late March or early April 1869, as Cassell's letter to Wright indicates was the case. That the publication was at a regular rate is confirmed by the sporadic journal notices I have found. The following conjectural timetable probably is close to the facts. The first sheet must have appeared at the very beginning of February. A full-page advertisement in The Bookseller for 31 Dec. 1863 (p. 981) announces a new edition of Shakespeare "In Weekly Numbers, price One Penny, and in Monthly Parts, price Fivepence and Sixpence. . . . No. I., ready January 29th." A notice for 30 January 1864 (p. 19) announces "Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare. No. I. Now ready." From these trade notices to booksellers and from the letter from Cassell's to Wright quoted above, I assume that No. 1 went on sale on about 1 Feb. 1864 (a Monday, and the beginning of the month), and I have used that approximate date as the basis for the rest of the timetable that follows. Assuming a beginning on 1 Feb. 1864, one would expect Vol. I to be complete (with the publication of Part 91) at about 23 Oct. 1865. A notice in The Bookseller of 30 Sept. 1865 (p. 607) announces "Vol. 1 (Comedies) . . . End of Oct.," and another on 31 Oct. (p. 695) announces "New Volumes Now Ready," though the volume is not listed (p. 780) in the comprehensive list of books published in October and so must have appeared at the very end of the month or early in November. These dates being consistent with each other, the schedule for Vol. I may be reconstructed as follows: Vol. I 1864: Pts. 1-6, Feb.-Mar., Tmp. ; 6-11, Mar.-Apr., TGV ; 11-17, Apr.-May, Wiv. ; 17-23, May-July, MM ; 23-27, July-Aug., Err. ; 28-33, Aug.-Sept., Ado ; 34-40, Sept.-Oct., LLL ; 41-46, Nov.-Dec., MND ; 46-48, Dec., MV (incomplete) 1865: Pts. 49-53, Jan., MV (completed); 53-60, Jan.-Mar., AYL ; 60-67, Mar.-May, Shr. ; 67-75, May-July, AWW ; 76-83, July-Aug., TN ; 83-91, Aug.-Oct., WT Similarly Vol. II, Histories, should have been completed with Part 166 on about 1 April 1867. A notice in The Bookseller for 30 March 1867 (p. 223) announces, "Now ready . . . The Second Volume of Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare, (Tragedies [an error for Histories] complete)." The volume is listed in the April 30 comprehensive list (p. 348) of "principal English publications for the month ending April 30" but not in the comparable list for 30 March (p. 268), hence it must have gone up for sale in early April. In the April notice it is correctly listed as "Vol. 2, Histories." The approximate schedule is: Vol. II. 1865: Pts. 92-98, Oct.-Dec., Jn. ; 98, Dec., R2 (incomplete) 1866: Pts. 99-105, Jan.-Feb., R2 (completed); 105-112, Feb.-Mar., 1H4 ; 113-120, Mar.-May, 2H4 ; 121-129, May-July, H5 ; 129-135, July-Aug., 1H6 ; 136-143, Sept.-Oct., 2H6 ; 143-150, Oct.-Dec., 3H6 ; 150-153, Dec., R3 (incomplete) 1867: Pts. 154-159, Jan.-Feb., R3 (completed); 159-166, Feb.-Apr., H8 Finally, one would expect Vol. III, or rather Part 270, to be completed by 29 March 1869. The Bookseller for 1 March 1869 (p. 252) announces "Completion of 'Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare'. This Magnificent crown 4to Edition . . . will be published in a few days. Complete in Three Volumes." This statement is accurate enough. Exactly by March 1, with the publication of the last part of Pericles (Part 266), the main body of the edition would have been complete. All that remained were Parts 267-9, the Life of Shakespeare, and Part 270, containing preliminary matter, errata, colophon, etc.—the work of "a few days." At the rate of one sheet a week the remaining parts should have been completed by 29 March or, if the last double part took two weeks, by 5 April. The latter date seems less likely because half the pages of that last double part were blank or mostly blank, though perhaps press time for two sheets extended into April. Cassell's letter to Wright says the date of completion was "about April," and either 29 March or 5 April fits that description well enough. The schedule: 1867: Pts. 167-174, Apr.-May, Tro. ; 175-184, June-Aug., Cor. ; 184-192, Aug.-Sept., Rom. ; 192-199, Sept.-Nov., Tim. ; 200-205, Nov.-Dec., JC (incomplete) 1868: Pt. 206, Jan., JC (completed); 206-213, Jan.-Feb., Mac. ; 213-223, Feb.-May, Ham. ; 224-223, May-July, Lr. ; 233-241, July-Sept., Oth. ; 242-250, Sept.-Nov., Ant. ; 251-257, Nov.-Dec., Cym. (incomplete) 1869: Pts. 258-260, Jan., Cym. (completed); 260-266, Jan.-Mar., Per. ; 267-269, Mar., Life; 270, Mar. [-Apr.?], Preface and accessories. The edition was popular and was reprinted several times. One reprint that I have seen is a completely reset folio in fours, using the plates for the original illustrations and some new type ornaments, and holding over from the original edition an announcement that the Preface and Life "will form [part of] the third and concluding Volume of the Work." A later reprint is from the same plates or stereotypes of them, which show signs of wear, and it includes 35 full-page wood engravings and 35 photogravure plates of 19th-century actors and actresses. It was issued in 6 vols. ("Divisions"). The reprints are undated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. John Payne Collier, ed. Plays and Poems . 8 vols. 1878. Serially issued in 43 parts, 1875-78. At the end of his long and productive life as Shakespearean scholar John Payne Collier (1789-1883), having already done three complete editions of Shakespeare in 1842-44, 1853, and 1858, between his eighty-sixth and eighty-ninth years produced yet a fourth. Collier had the edition privately printed by Thomas Richards, and he sold it in monthly parts to at first fifty and later, when printing costs increased, to fifty-eight subscribers, whom he thanks in a Preface dated 11 Jan. 1878 "for their four-years-continued approbation." In his advertisement to potential subscribers in the Athenaeum of 9 January 1875 (No. 2463, p. 52) he promises a text and notes "avoiding all controversy," and he does in fact withdraw the majority of the controversial emendations from his notorious Perkins Folio that he had included in earlier editions, substituting original quarto or folio readings and numerous new readings. Although in the first issue ( Tmp. ) Collier remarks that the monthly parts will be "separately paged, in order that they may be arranged according to the wish of each recipient," in fact he expected them to be bound in order of receipt, and at regular intervals issued title pages for each of seven volumes, naming the plays for that volume in their order of appearance. These title pages were included in the issues of Ado, AWW, 1H4, R3, Rom., Lr. , and TNK , and are dated 1875 for vols. 1 and 2, 1876 for vols. 3, 4, and 5, and 1877 for vols. 6 and 7. When Collier finally decided to add an eighth volume including the Poems (as well as apocryphal plays) he retroactively changed the title page of the edition from Plays to Plays and Poems and in the final issue included revised title pages for all volumes, dated 1878. Since the bound volumes usually bear these replacement title pages, the edition is cited and catalogued as published in 1878. In the Folger Library set of unbound parts, tipped into a dozen numbers — Wiv., MV, AWW, Jn., 1H4, H5, 3H6, Rom., Mac., Oth., Per. , and Mucedorus —are notices from Collier announcing the next two or three plays to appear. Since these notices are usually dated, as are the original title pages for the first seven volumes, establishing the sequence and approximate dates for the individual plays is a simple matter. Of the twenty-eight plays mentioned in these notices, all are clearly in the sequence indicated by the seven original title pages, and so we may safely assume that the other plays are in the same sequence. Since more than twelve numbers appeared each year, it is impossible to give exact dates for every issue; instead, in the table below, the plays are listed in sequence and dates are given for those issues in which appear dated notices or title pages: Vol. I: Tmp., TGV, Wiv. (notice, n. d.), MM, Err., Ado (t. p., 1875) Vol. II: LLL, MND, MV (notice, July 1875), AYL, Shr., AWW (notice, n. d., t. p., 1875) Vol. III: TN, WT, Jn. (Dec. 1875), Ed3, R2, 1H4 (notice, Feb. 1876; t. p., 1876) Vol. IV: 2H4, H5 (notice, Apr. 1876), 1H6, 2H6, 3H6 (notice, June 1876), R3 (t. p., 1876) Vol. V: H8, Tro., Cor., Tit., Rom. (notice, Dec. 1876; t. p., 1876) Vol. VI: Tim., JC, Mac. (notice, Feb. 1877), Ham., Lr. (t. p., 1877) Vol. VII: Oth. (notice, May 1877), Ant., Cym., Per. (notice, n. d.), TNK (t. p., 1877) Vol. VIII: Yorkshire Tragedy, Mucedorus (notice, Oct. 1877), Ven. &amp; Luc., Son. &amp; Misc. Poems (Preface, 11 Jan. 1878; t. p., 1878). Although Collier's Preface speaks of "Four-years-continued approbation," the time span is really three years, since he advertised for subscribers in Jan. 1875 and completed the edition by Jan. 1878.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Charlotte Brontë Manuscripts: Two Sketches and Her Holograph Preface to The Professor by Janet Butler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Over the years, Charlotte Brontë's Professor has attracted relatively little critical attention—which may be why no one appears to have noticed the two short passages (totalling little more than a hundred words) pencilled in her hand on the separate manuscript of its "Preface" at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. The manuscript of The Professor is bound with a copy of the "Preface," the latter, however, not in Charlotte's handwriting but that of her husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls; this "Preface" was printed with the novel when it was first published in 1857, two years after Charlotte's death. Along with Nicholls' clarifying note (dated 22 September 1856), the "Preface" has accompanied subsequent reprintings of The Professor . Yet the Pierpont Morgan also holds Charlotte's own pencilled draft for this "Preface," complete with her deletions and revisions, thus making it of interest in its own right (see Appendix). The card catalogue description of it reads: "The Professor, preface; original autograph manuscript, written in pencil. 1½ p. 8 ." It is more than likely that Charlotte wrote out this "Preface" in January of 1851, sure in her own mind that her publishers would, following her successes with Jane Eyre (1847) and Shirley (1849), reconsider and agree to publish The Professor , written five years earlier. They did not, and the manuscript—as well as "Preface"—was put away "in a cupboard" until Nicholls should bring it to light again a year or so after his wife's death (SHB 3: 206-207). The manuscript of the "Preface" is one sheet of paper folded once on itself so as to make two leaves; each of the four pages is (length by width) approximately 18.1 X 11.5 cm (or 7½ X 4½ in.). 1 The "Preface" begins on the recto of the first leaf and concludes a little more than halfway down the verso—hence the catalogue description of "1½ p." But, on the recto of the second leaf, taking up slightly more than five lines, is pencilled the following in Charlotte's hand: C'est possible—" and he lipped his cigar in a peculiar | manner that he had when he was a little posed and | puzzled without being displeased. "And can I marry or not?" | she pursued. "Mademoiselle, I don't dislike to put the question | to myself—I am an egoist and like to linger over points im-|portant to myself There is no more, not even a final period or quotation mark. It is necessary to turn the manuscript upside down in order to read the fourth page, which now appears as a first page. The surface is covered with arithmetic; evidently Charlotte had been trying to figure out the number of pages which one of her handwritten manuscripts would produce in print, for the vocabulary of "letters per line," "lines per page," and "letters per page" covers the entire area. Near the top of the page, however, and crossed out with a large "X" and further overscored with some of the arithmetic are the following six lines, again in pencil and barely decipherable: About this time *befel [ ab. del. 'occurred'] that grand ['event' del. ]—a fête day of | Mlle Pauline. *and it was upon [ ab. del. 'All the masters'] this occasion I *enjoyed [ ab. del. 'felt in'] to | its fullness the *advantage [ ab. del. illeg. ] of my privileged position as professeur | de pensionnat de demoiselles—I received a note of invitation. | Not indifferent to me now the small document—nor unattractive | the scene to which it offered admission The crossed-out word in the third line is illegible. The eighth word in the penultimate line is difficult to make out: "document" seems the most likely reading. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II What are these two new passages at the Pierpont Morgan? Brontë scholars will recognize the second one as a re-working of The Professor . If, therefore, we are to hazard a guess as to a possible date, we must quickly review the circumstances of its composition and probable revision. In February of 1842, Charlotte and Emily went to study French at the Pensionnat Heger in Brussels; this was to prepare them to become (along with Anne) headmistresses of their own proposed school at Haworth. On 1 January 1844, at age twenty-seven, Charlotte left Brussels for the last time. There followed two years of personal, private suffering. 3 During her twenty months at the Pensionnat she had unwittingly—and probably until the very end, unknowingly—fallen in love with her "dear Master," the very dynamic but also very married Constantin Heger. Then in April of 1846, on behalf of all the sisters, Charlotte wrote Aylott and Jones about their possible interest in "three distinct and unconnected tales" (SHB 2:87). These were to be Emily's Wuthering Heights , Anne's Agnes Grey , and Charlotte's The Professor , a short novel set in Brussels. Tellingly, Charlotte originally titled it The Master . 4 By the time The Professor reached the firm of Smith, Elder in July of 1847, it had been rejected five times since the summer of 1846 (SHB 2:152-153). William Smith Williams, reader for Smith, Elder, also rejected the hapless manuscript, but his two-page letter was so courteous and specific that Charlotte wrote back that she (or, rather, Currer Bell) would like to send him a three-volume manuscript then nearing completion. 5 Three weeks later she sent him Jane Eyre which was quickly accepted and published on October 16th. But the Brussels experience was recent enough and dominant enough in her life that she still needed to see it in print, albeit fictionally disguised. Jane Eyre was not enough. Just two months after that novel's publication, she wrote William Smith Williams a letter dated 14 December 1847 in which she took up a question he had evidently put to her regarding a second novel, perhaps to be serialized; Currer Bell wrote that a three-volume novel would feel more natural than a serialization, and then went on: "Respecting the plan of such a work, I have pondered it, but as yet with very unsatisfactory results. Three commencements have I essayed, but all three displease me. A few days since I looked over "The Professor." . . . My wish is to recast "The Professor," add as well as I can what is deficient, retrench some parts, develop others, and make of it a three-volume work—no easy task, I know, yet I trust not an impracticable one" (SHB 2:161-162). She went on to ask his judgment of this proposal "before I take any step to execute the plan I have sketched," and concluded by asking, "and what confidence have you that I can make it [ The Professor ] better than it is?" Unfortunately, Williams' response to this posed problem is not extant, and Charlotte's next surviving letter to him (28 January 1848) does not refer to any specific manuscript; indeed, for the first few months of 1848 there is really nothing in her correspondence to indicate if the work she has in hand is still The Professor or if it has turned a corner and become Shirley . Yet in her 1983 study, The Early Writings of Charlotte Brontë , Christine Alexander suggests that a recasting of The Professor was taking place sometime during the fall and perhaps winter of 1847-48. She points to an untitled manuscript known sometimes as John Henry and sometimes as The Moores ; 6 the narrative breaks off after the opening of chapter three, but its focus on the two Crimsworth brothers (whose names are now changed to Moore) points to a revision of the early chapters of The Professor . Of equal interest is Alexander's reference to "an earlier preface to The Professor , about which little is known" (Alexander, 223). This manuscript (Bonnell Collection, Haworth) breaks off after one and a half pages. It consists of Currer Bell's critique of the narrator, William Crimsworth, as well as "the same summary of the early lives of the two brothers, Edward and William, that we find in The Professor , in John Henry , and in the juvenilia" (Alexander 224). "Three commencements have I essayed . . ." Alexander suggests that John Henry (or The Moores ) is one of these three "commencements," and that perhaps the little known and as yet unpublished earlier "Preface" (in the Bonnell Collection) is still another (222, 223). We might now speculate that the "professeur de pensionnat" fragment in the Pierpont Morgan is a portion of the third of the three "commencements" made late in 1847. On the other hand, we must not overlook the likelihood that Charlotte was tinkering with The Professor as late as January of 1851 as she raised the question of its publication once again with Smith, Elder and optimistically prepared the (Pierpont Morgan) "Preface" against its presumed acceptance. Indeed, she remarked in the "Preface" that "to have reached him [the reader] in the form of a printed book, this brief narrative must have gone through some struggles—which indeed it has"; this suggests that in January of 1851 she must at least have outlined to her publishers how she might develop the narrative if only they would agree to publish it. But whether the date is 1847 or 1851, the fragment's reference to "Mlle Pauline" would indicate that Charlotte had actually been thinking along the lines of the more developed "three-volume work" proposed in her December 1847 letter to William Smith Williams: the Paulina Mary Home of Villette apparently has an antecedent in the French-named "Pauline" in the fragment under discussion, and "Mlle Pauline" might have been intended to remedy the "want of varied interest" for which Williams had criticized The Professor (Gaskell, 317). The first of the two fragments at the Pierpont Morgan—"C'est possible'"—is at once more elusive and more suggestive. Elusive, in that we do not know the principals involved and therefore cannot even hazard a date. But the fragment is also suggestive in its directness: it has the force of a waking dream, and unlike the "professeur de pensionnat" fragment, it is written without difficulty or correction of any kind. Moreover, it captures attention by means of its alliterative patterning and unusual lexical choices. 7 But, for Brontë scholars, this passage has more importance than its possible relationship to The Professor . True, since it is on the same sheet of paper not only with the "Preface" but also with the evident developing of The Professor 's protagonist, the "professeur de pensionnat," it may in some way be related to that early novel. On the other hand, one might argue an even stronger relationship to what that same Brussels material would eventually become: Villette . In support of this conjecture, we should note that the first language of the man in this passage is French, not English. Moreover, his habits of cigarsmoking and self-dramatization disqualify him as little William Crimsworth and his "demure Quaker countenance" (SHB 3:207). Finally, the sexual tension in the passage is reminiscent of scenes between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, between Lucy Snowe and M. Paul. However, the question which "Mademoiselle" puts to the man, "And can I marry or not?" is not consonant with the conditions of being a governess in someone else's home; nineteenth-century governesses simply did not work and marry simultaneously. It is, however, just the question which a young, would-be headmistress might put to her mentor. Charlotte's experience in England had been with headmistresses who did not marry, but in Brussels she saw Mme. Heger functioning daily as both headmistress and married woman. The fragment, then, might be the first groping toward the character of M. Paul in Villette , specifically towards the kind of baiting he indulges in with Lucy Snowe in the chapters titled "A Burial" and "The Watchguard." Tonally, there are similarities between this tiny fragment and the finished novel. The two fragments reproduced here are not mentioned in the card catalogue at the Pierpont Morgan. Herbert Cahoon, Curator of Autograph MSS, informed me that the "Preface" was purchased by Pierpont Morgan himself from the London firm of Pearson, booksellers, in February of 1909. It does not seem that anyone has examined the autograph "Preface"—or either of these two fragments—in the intervening years. 8</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am grateful for help given by both Juliet R. V. Barker, Curator and Librarian at the Brontë Parsonage Museum and Library, Haworth, and Herbert Cahoon, Curator of Autograph MSS at the Pierpont Morgan Library. David Jackson McWilliams, Director of the Casa del Libro museum in San Juan, was kind enough to obtain photocopies of the manuscript for me while he was in New York. 2 This manuscript fits well the description which Mrs. Gaskell made of Charlotte's writing habits. "She wrote on these bits of paper in a minute hand, holding each against a piece of board, such as is used in binding books, for a desk. This plan was necessary for one so short-sighted as she was; and, besides, it enabled her to use pencil and paper, as she sat near the fire in the twilight hours, or if (as was too often the case) she was wakeful for hours in the night" (Gaskell, 307; in all editions, vol. 2, ch. 1). The "piece of board . . . such as is used in binding books" was undoubtedly the cover of an octavo, only slightly larger than the folded-over paper on which Charlotte did her writing of first drafts. 3 On 14 October 1846 she would write to her friend, Ellen Nussey, "I returned to Brussels [29 January 1843] after Aunt's death against my conscience—prompted by what then seemed an irresistible impulse—I was punished for my selfish folly by a total withdrawal for more than two years of happiness and peace of mind . . . (SHB 2: 115). 4 As Herbert Wroot pointed out half a century ago (Wroot, 196), when the autograph manuscript of The Professor is held to the light, one can see that the present title has been pasted over the original one, The Master . 5 Gaskell 317; in all editions, vol. 2, ch. 2. This letter is not included in SHB. 6 The manuscript has been reprinted as Appendix D of the 1979 Clarendon edition of Shirley , ed. Herbert Rosengarten and Margaret Smith. 7 Though it was already heading towards archaism, Charlotte had used the adjective "posed" before ( The Professor , first paragraph of ch. 3). "Lipped," on the other hand, is quite fresh; the OED records no use earlier than 1826 for the sense in which Charlotte uses it here. 8 In 1960, M. M. Brammer made a careful study of the autograph manuscript of The Professor . However, she makes no reference at all to Charlotte's pencilled draft of the "Preface"; it seems likely that she never saw it, for in a footnote she remarks of The Professor that she had consulted "a microfilm copy" (158).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographer , Book-Lore , and The Bookworm by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The subtitles and vital statistics of the periodicals of my title are, in order: A Journal of Book-Lore , 6 vols., 1881-84; A Magazine Devoted to Old Time Literature , 6 vols., Dec. 1884-Nov. 1887; An Illustrated Treasury of Old Time Literature , 7 vols., 1888-94. 1 One is struck by the repetitions in titles and subtitles and by the chronology, one periodical taking up where the previous one left off. All were published by Elliott Stock of London. Henry Benjamin Wheatley was editor of The Bibliographer and W. E. A. Axon of Book-Lore . I should add here that none of the three periodicals is so much as listed in the two editions of the CBEL , Wheatley's editorship of The Bibliographer also being ignored, as, indeed, it is in the British Museum catalogue of printed books. Contributors to these periodicals include F. J. Furnivall, T. J. Wise, Henry Bradshaw, J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, L. Toulmin Smith, William Blades, H. R. Plomer, William Roberts, F. Madan, Nicholas Pocock, G. L. Gomme, Leonard A. Wheatley, C. A. Ward, T. N. Postlethwaite, W. P. Courtney, W. Carew Hazlitt, as well as contributors from Canada, New York, Brisbane, among other places. Most of the signed contributions occur in The Bibliographer , relatively few in The Bookworm . Some of the contributions to these periodicals were later published separately, as for example Wheatley's account of John Payne Collier in The Bibliographer . Some of the contributions formed the basis for later work, notably with F. Madan's bibliography of writings by and on Henry Sacheverell, contributed to The Bibliographer , which was later expanded by his son, F. F. Madan. 2 All in all, for the above reasons and others to follow, these periodicals deserve to be known and further studied. In what follows I proceed chronologically through the three periodicals, recording what I have gleaned of the hitherto unremarked without reference to order of magnitude. Relatively little emerged from The Bibliographer , a letter of Thomas Bewick's with proposals for his History of Quadrupeds being first printed there (I [December 1881], 20-21) and now available in Sydney Roscoe's bibliographie raisonné of some of Bewick's works issued in his lifetime (1953), pp. 7-9. William Beckford, author of Vathek , was, it is well known, an avid collector of books. What is more, he had a penchant for writing comments or copying passages from his books on their flyleafs or in their margins. Many of the books with his marginalia have been identified 3 but not among them those described by an anonymous contributor to the second volume of The Bibliographer in an account of the "Beckford Library" (July 1882, pp. 25-27). Here is the pertinent part of the account: He did much for display, but he collected books because he loved them. These books he read, he knew them well, and he annotated them. The number of lots in which his notes will be found are numerous, and to some of these we propose first to draw our readers' attention. We learn from the catalogue that Beckford has filled five pages of fly-leaves to his namesake Peter Beckford's Familiar Letters from Italy (2 vols., Salisbury, 1805), and these notes he concludes thus: "This book has at least some merit—the language is simple; an ill-natured person might add—and the thoughts not less so." His opinion of Miss Benger's Memoirs of Mary Queen of Scots is summed up in this very uncomplimentary criticism: "I wish, dear Miss Benger, that your style was a little less ornate, and your information a little less inaccurate." Another lady author fares even worse at his hands; for of Miss Aikin's Memoirs of the Court of James I. he writes: "I wish Lucy would take to the needle instead of the pen, and darn stockings instead of history. She would then be more harmlessly employed than in leading unhappy readers with open appetites into the purchase of literary aliment already reduced to a caput mortuum by repeated stewings." Beckford criticizes Brasbridge's Fruits of Experience , 1824, in this strong language: "They who like hog-wash—and there are amateurs for everything—will not turn away disappointed or disgusted with this book, but relish the stale trashy anecdotes it contains and gobble them with avidity." These are merely a sample of the annotations which will be found in a large number of the books: for instance, a fine set of the European Magazine , 80 vols., bound in russia extra by Kalthoeber, contains MS. notes in every volume. Lot 735 consists of seven folio volumes of Transcriptions from the autograph notes written by Beckford on the fly-leaves of the various works in his library. I should very much like to see the eighty volumes of the European Magazine and, equally, lot 735. Volume five (December 1883, p. 19) yielded a paragraph from a letter of a friend of Byron's who described the delight the poet expressed in Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward . Byron and Scott were friends, and Byron more than once praised Scott's novels, but I have found no reference to this letter. I quote the whole item: In a letter written by a friend of Byron and recently printed for the first time appears this paragraph, says the New York Tribune , concerning the poet's delight in Scott's work: "He was very fond of Scott's novels—you will have observed they were always scattered about his rooms at Metaxata. The day before he left the island I happened to receive a copy of Quentin Durward , which I put into his hand, knowing that he had not seen it and that he wished to obtain the perusal of it. He immediately shut himself in his room, and in his eagerness to indulge in it refused to dine with the officers of the 8th Regiment at their mess, or even to join us at the table, but merely came out once or twice to say how much he was entertained, returning to his chamber with a plate of figs in his hand. He was exceedingly delighted with Quentin Durward , and said it was excellent, especially the first volume and part of the second, but that it fell off toward the conclusion, like all the more recent of these novels; it might be, he added, owing to the extreme rapidity with which they were written—admirably conceived and as well executed at the outset, but hastily finished off." Only one more item of interest, Mark Twain's answer to the question as to what he thought of an international copyright law, emerged from volume five (March 1884, p. 115): "I am forty-seven years old, and therefore shall not live long enough too see international copyright established, neither will my children live long enough: yet, for the sake of my (possible) remote descendants, I feel a languid interest in the subject. Yes—to answer your question squarely,—I am in favour of an international copyright law. So was my great grandfather,—it was in 1847 that he made his struggle in his great work—and it is my hope and prayer that as long as my stock shall last the transmitted voice of that old man will still go ringing down the centuries, stirring the international heart in the interest of the eternal cause for which he struggled and died. I favour the treaty which was proposed four or five years ago, and is still being considered by our State department. I also favour engraving it on brass. It is on paper now. There is no lasting quality about paper." Book-Lore proved slightly more rewarding, although none of the gleanings will generate much excitement. In volume one there were three items of interest to students of the life and works of Samuel Johnson, none of which is listed in the Clifford/Greene bibliography (1970). The first is titled "Johnson Bibliography" (December 1884, p. 26) and in it R. H. suggests, "I think that we may add [to Boswell's list] the preface to A New Compendious Grammar of the Greek Tongue , by W. Bell, A. B. London, 1775. This reads Johnsonian:—'That the knowledge of the Greek language is a valuable and necessary accomplishment for all who desire to be useful to the literary world, none will deny' etc." Furthermore he was of opinion that "The preface to [William] Guthrie's General History of the World , 1764, was probably by Johnson." Neither of these is mentioned in Allen Hazen's Samuel Johnson's Prefaces and Dedications (1937), the definitive work. The second item is entitled "Johnsoniana" (January 1885, pp. 39-40) and in it reference is made to an article in the November 1884 Harper's Magazine dealing with Columbia College, "which contains an interesting reference to Dr. Johnson," one which should have wider circulation. Dr. Johnson wrote one letter to William Samuel Johnson, first president of Columbia College. "A family tradition," the Harper's Magazine account is quoted, "says that when he [William Samuel Johnson] introduced himself as an American, the gruff old doctor retorted: 'The Americans! What do they know, and what do they read?' 'They read, sir, The Rambler ,' was the polite and apt reply, which so won the doctor that before his namesake left London he presented him with 'an elegantly bound copy of his large folio dictionary, and an engraving of himself from a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which he considered his best likeness.' The two became life-long correspondents, and some of the letters are still preserved at the Stratford homestead ." So much from Harper's , but the unknown contributor of this "Johnsoniana" added, "We have italicised a passage which should excite some American admirer of Dr. Johnson to obtain the requisite permission to examine these letters." To date I doubt any one has sought permission, surely because both accounts have been overlooked by Johnsonians. 4 R. H., in his "Johnsonian Bibliography" (I [December 1884], 26) had written that " A Miscellany of Poems , by J. Husbands, Oxford, 1731," in which Johnson had a part, had escaped his "closest searching." F. Madan (I [January 1885], 59) was able to enlighten R. H. by reference to, and bibliographical description of, a copy of the work in the Bodleian Library. Of similar interest is a thirteen-page article by John Davies entitled "The 'Adamo' of Giovanni Soranzo" (IV. 57-69) in which the author tries to demonstrate Milton's knowledge of I duoi primi libri dell Adamo di Giovanni Soranzo by a comparison of various passages. Harris Fletcher noted briefly of it, "Comparison with Paradise Lost . Good." in 1931, 5 and it has since been ignored, not even meriting a mention in the Milton Encyclopedia of 1978. The richest harvest came in The Bookworm , beginning with an anonymous contribution to volume two entitled "Pope and Hughes" (1889, pp. 104-105) in which "Under date January 20, 1832 the late Mr. J. Payne Collier has given the following interesting facts in relation to Pope and Hughes," i.e. that he bought "a nice clean copy of Hughes' 'Calypso and Telemachus,' 8 vo., 1712" and found two fly-leaves covered with writing in a hand he "recognized in an instant." I allow him to continue. It was Pope's! and it was headed by him— "'To Mr. Hughes, On His Opera'; it consisted of thirty-eight couplets. This is the second piece of original composition by Pope in his own autograph that has devolved into my hands quite accidentally, and I am duly grateful. I transcribe the whole of it here, exactly as it stands in the original, lest by any chance that original should be lost. To whom the book had belonged first, I know not: probably to Hughes himself, who pasted in the fly-leaves, but the name of a former owner, whoever he was, has been cut away; possibly it was Pope's own book and he may have deposited in it his tribute to Hughes. It has no great originality, and one of the rhymes, 'sons' and 'mourns,' is unlike Pope in his later day. In 1712, when 'Calypso and Telemachus' was acted and published, he was in his twenty-fourth year. "' To Mr. Hughes , on his Opera . "'When, dearest Hughes, you strike the tunefull strings, And, taught by you, our British Opera sings, Th' Italian Muse is forc'd to quit the stage, Whilst charms superior captivate the age: Music and Verse no longer disagree, Nor's Sense thought useless now to Harmony. In your Telemachus both parts unite, And charming sounds are joyn'd with solid wit. These Nature studied, and those powerfull arts Which strike the secret springs that guide our hearts. Sooth'd with your verse, fierce factions peace proclaim, Rough Whiggs grow mild, and hottest Torys tame: At your command their conquer'd passions move, With you they rage, they pity, hate and love. Then such instructions flow from Mentor's tongue, Minerva only could inspire the song: Whilst each description shines so clear and bright, We fancy every thing before our sight. How gayly drest the first bright scene appears, What wanton beautys all the island wears! Methinks I hear the murmuring waters flow, And echoing rocks repeat Calypso's woe. Now the fond Goddess lost Ulysses mourns, But quickly for the younger hero burns: What art doth she not try? what charms put on? To make the beateous haughty youth her own. Then, what fierce furys in her bosom rise, To find the prince her proffered love despise. See in Telemachus the best of sons, With what true filial piety he mourns; Whence Eucharis coquet, gay, young and fair, Finds means to trap him in th' enchanted snare: With greedy looks he draws his ruin on, Sucks in the charm, and hastes to be undone. Here Mentor for a while withdraws his face; And let's him feel the danger of the place, But as he seems just sinking in the waves, Exerts the goddess, and the hero saves.'" Needless to say, there is no mention of this poem, whether it be Pope's or not, in the Twickenham edition. Pope's letters to Hughes begin in 1714, two years after the opera, and hence are of no evidential value. Volume three contains a letter from Thomas Moore to a Mrs. Wyke which is not included in the collected Letters , edited by Wilfred S. Dowden, 2 vols. (1964). Mr. C. M. Collins of Brisbane sent the copy of the letter in his possession, noting that "the letter is addressed on the outside leaf to 'Mrs. Wyke, 20, Above Bar, Southampton,' and bears the Devizes postmark" (III [1890], 79). I quote the letter in full. Stoperton Cottage Devises March 4th 1819 I am most sincerely sorry to think I should have given one moment's pain to a heart which, I fear, is destined to pay the usual tax of genius, and feels everything in this life much more deeply than it ought. But the truth is that on first reading the letter which inclosed your daughter's beautiful lines on my little boy, I thought you expressed an intention of going to Brighton immediately , and as no address there was mentioned, I looked upon an answer from me as out of the question. Some time after however, (though too late), I perceived, upon re-perusing your letter, that some weeks were to elapse before your departure for Brighton, during all which time my answer must, of course, have been expected.—Pray explain all this to Miss Wyke and tell her I am the last person in the world to be guilty of neglect to a young poetess, [ non sic in original] such as I fancy her to be. I am, however the less sorry for this accident as it has been the means of producing such lines as I have just received from her, which I prefer to any she has done me the honour of sending me yet, as they possess more feeling and less attempt at brilliancy, (a fault into which, I rather fear, my example may have seduced her), than most of the others. Yours, my dear Madam, very faithfully Thomas Moore. Mr. Collins further noted that "in 1830, 'Bertha, a Tale of the Waldenses, and Other Poems,' by Anne Wyke, was printed and published at Shrewsbury by Charles Hulbert, and sold in London by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, and this may have been the 'young poetess' to whom Moore refers." There is no entry under "Wyke" in the index to the Letters nor in that to the 1977 biography by Terence de Vere White. Miss Wyke, incidentally, wrote no more. In the same volume there is a short letter of Algernon Charles Swinburne's (1890, pp. 171-172) that is not in The Swinburne Letters , edited by Cecil Y. Lang (1959-62). It was one of a collection of autographs sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge on May 21, 1890. The letter, dated December 20, 1871, is to an unidentified magazine editor; he was, however James Rice, owner and editor of Once a Week , 1868-72. 6 Here is the letter. I have received your note, in answer to my reply of the 1st, asking for 'not more than sixteen lines' I fear I can hardly undertake to supply verse to order in point of length or otherwise; in any case I should certainly not think it worth while to let a magazine have the fruits of anything of mine for less than £10. But Swinburne's "Sestina," no sixteen lines it, was published in Rice's magazine on January 6, 1872 ( Letters , II. 171, n.1). And although there is a two-volume collection of the letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Robert Hengist Horne and editions of her letters to various other correspondents, the following charming letter to Horne, dated March 10, 1841, when she was still unmarried, has been overlooked. It, like the Swinburne letter, is one in a collection of "Some Letters of Literary Celebrities" (1890, pp. 169-172). "I have a little spaniel called Flush, the descendant of Miss Mitford's spaniel, Flush the Famous, which she sent me for company, &amp; beside to remind me of her. He is spoilt of course—it couldn't be helped under the circumstances—for, in addition to the association, he gave me most ready affection, notwithstanding all my dulness as a playmate—&amp; it was only natural that I should murmur when my maid told me she had been obliged to whip him for a misdemeanor. His sin, at its first aspect, looked a heavy one. He had torn up into fragments, like a critic, a volume of Lamartine's poems—into fragments an inch square. 'Oh, but,' I said, 'how could he know any better?' There's an apology for the critics! 'He should be taught,' she replied, 'or he'll tear up all the books in the house. He'll tear them all to pieces if he's not whipped.' Think of that! Did the critics do you much harm formerly, dear Mr. Horne, when you went for sympathy to Echo? or was it a mere pestilent silence? But you may whip them for ever without making them better—I lose my moral so." What may possibly be more important than any other bit gleaned from The Bookworm is a series of three communications by a James Hayes on "Sir Robert Walpole as a Collector of Pamphlets" (IV [1891], 81-84, 149-151, 217-220). While this is not my line of country, I find no mention of these pamphlets and of Sir Robert's marginalia in some of them in J. H. Plumb's two-volume biography (1956) nor in subsequent literature on Sir Robert. I quote the first paragraph of the first communication. IN a quarto volume of rare Black-letter pamphlets (seventeen in number) lying before me, I find many things which may, perhaps, interest the readers of The Bookworm. Most of these 17th century pamphlets are noted and the volume is indexed in the handwriting of the famous Whig Minister. He writes at the head of index—"No. 1 is taken out for the book on Public Revenues. This absent pamphlet is styled in index, "Offices of Places of Trust not to be bought or sold,"—a most suggestive title, indeed, for the period. Three things at once become evident on an examination of the book. First that Sir Robert was a close student of Machiavelli; secondly, that only the political pamphlets had the advantage of his notes and comments; and thirdly, that the universities, church rule, commerce, navigation, and war engrossed much of his attention. While students of the politics of the period will wish to read the three letters in their entirety, I shall only quote or comment upon a few passages. Hayes writes that Sir Robert's comment on pamphlet number seven "is well worth remembering, and as he places it before title, I shall follow his example. It is 'When au't is not encoridged then it goes to decay.' 'Proposals for printing a Book entituled Longitude found out by the accurate goeing of a new invented AUTOMATON by John Carte, English Watchmaker at the Corner of the Ness over against the Kaysers Hoff in Hamburgh.' The above consists of 12 pp. 4to, without date or imprint" (IV. 82). Hayes notes that it is number fifteen of the series to which Sir Robert pays most attention and then goes on, He fondles it as if it were his own; but we must remember that he was only a stripling of twenty-two when the pamphlet was written. We do not know the date of his comments. If he did not write it, he did not know who did, as in every other case he notes the author either in index, title or margin. It is called "A Short History of Standing Armies in England" (London, printed in the year 1698, 54 pp). He copies on verso of title the following extracts from preface:—"A Government is a mere piece of Clockwork; and having such Springs and Wheels, must move after a certain manner: and therefore the Art is to constitute it so that it must move to the Public Advantage. It is certain that every Man will act for his own Interest; and all wise Governments are founded upon this Principle: so that the whole Mystery is only to make the Interest of the Governors and the Governed the same." Again, "Some will servilely comply with ye Court to Keep their Places, others will oppose as unreasonably to get them." After another quotation he writes, "It is as hard a matter for a man to be perfectly bad as perfectly good: Machiavell." Hayes states, in his second installment, of the nine remaining pamphlets not commented upon, that "space will not admit of more than a cursory glance of each" (IV. 149), and that is about all he allots them. Of number twelve, "England must pay the Piper. Being a seasonable discourse about Raising of money this Session," he writes, "This ably written tract is by 'Sir R(obert) W(alpole)'. There is, for prudent reasons, no imprint, 12 pp." Sir Robert's youngest son, Horace, included his father in his Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England, With Lists of their Works , prefacing the list of twelve items with the statement that "About the end of Queen Anne's reign, and the beginning of George the First, he wrote the following pamphlets." "England must pay the Piper" is not in that list. However, the only pamphlet of that name, England must pay the Piper , tout court , is dated 1691 in the Short Title Catalogue , and Robert Walpole was born in 1676. In the third installment Hayes tells of "a companion octavo volume of pamphlets to that described in the February and April numbers of the BOOKWORM," several of which he believed would "command attention" (IV. 217). The first of these pamphlets is mistakenly attributed to Sir Robert. It is Two Letters to the Right Hon. Lord. Visc. Townshend . . . (1714), by R. W. who, according to the British Museum catalogue of printed books, is Robert Watts, not Robert Walpole. On what is insufficient evidence, then, James Hayes was of the opinion that "So far as the writings of Sir Robert noticed in these articles are concerned, I find self-assertion not to be his forte ; but he does not conceal the fact that he has been the stayer and capable weight-carrier of his party, and the chief moulder and propagandist of the Policy of the Whigs from the Start" (IV. 219). A brief note in volume six (1893) entitled "Letters of Mrs. Browning" (pp. 100-101) begins, "An exceedingly interesting and important series of letters of Miss Elizabeth Barrett, who subsequently became wife of Robert Browning, came under the hammer at Messrs. Puttick Simpson's sale recently. They are all written between 1842 and 1845, to Mr. Cornelius Mathews of New York." The fourteen letters in the lot fetched a total of £61 4s. The anonymous contributor of the note gives some details of, and quotes from, but seven of the fourteen. The first is a charming epistle, dated November 3, 1842, in which the writer says: "It is delightful and encouraging to me to think that there, among the cataracts and mountains which I never shall see, there in 'dreamland,' sound the voices of friends, and it shall be a constant effort with me to deserve presents in some better measure, the kindness for which I never can be more grateful than now." The second, written on the 25th of the same month, mentions Miss Metford, Charles Dickens, and others, and concludes, "It is better, however, to want criticism than to want poetry, and poetry is rising with us, be sure. And I would solicit your reverence for our Tennyson and our Browning (who though he speaks obscured yet delivers oracles), and also dramatic sketches and tragedies of Mr. Horne. Mr. Tennyson is a great poet, notwithstanding that very scornful word which I was very sorry to see in the North American Review ." The next letter was written in February of the following year, and deals chiefly with critics and criticism, and in the course of which she says, "I admire 'Boz' with everybody who can read, think, and feel, and I do not doubt that he was, as you say, 'honest'— i.e. , true-hearted—in those Notes for General Circulation. Still he knows mankind in the mass too well to be quite justified, I fancy, in passing such a set of judgments, authorised by such a set of evidences, formed upon such a set of opportunities upon the special humanity of a nation, and even the nascent Pecksniffs and Pinches have not quite restored my good humour to him." In the next letter, March 14, 1843, she asks, "Why do not men remember that every mind must be original if it delivers frankly its individual impressions?" and in a letter of the 28th of the following month she has an exceedingly curious reference to "Mr. Browning's 'Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' which would make one poet furious, the 'infelix Talfourd,' and another a little melancholy, namely, Mr. Browning himself." In a letter, dated October 1, 1844, she expresses annoyance at being called a follower of Tennyson, her "habit of using compound words, noun substantives, which I used to do before I knew a page of Tennyson. The custom is so far from being peculiar to Tennyson, that Shelley and Keats and Leigh Hunt are all redolent of it." One of the longest, and certainly the most interesting, is the last of the series, and is dated December 5, 1845: "You amuse me when you say that Mr. Poe has dedicated a book to me and abused me in the preface. That I should not think human justice—if it were not American. . . . I understand Mr. Browning has just published another volume of 'Bells and Pomegranates,' in which his great original faculty throws out new colours and expands in new combinations. A great poet he is—a greater poet he will be—for to work and to live are one with him. . . . Walter Savage Landor has lately addressed the following verses to him:— "'TO ROBERT BROWNING. "'There is delight in singing though none hear Beside the singer, and there is delight In praising, though the praiser sit alone And see the praised far off him, far above.'" &amp;c., &amp;c. The letter concludes— "Mr. Tennyson has a pension, you see, but for the rest, is said rather to smoke than to make poems. . . . Dickens is about to cast himself headlong into the doubtful undertaking of the new daily paper The Daily News ." The fourteen letters realised a total of £61 4s. Only the letters of April 28, 1843, and October 1, 1884, are included in F. G. Kenyon's edition of Mrs. Browning's Letters (2 vols. 1897); that for November 3, 1842 was printed in Thomas Powell's Pictures of the Living Authors of Britain (New York 1849; London, 1851) and then reprinted in Notes and Queries for November 18, 1944. Some Browning scholar should take it upon himself to trace the descent of these letters. One of the unidentified seven letters may be that to Mathews of date Nov. 14, 1844 ( Letters , I. 213-215). Edmund Gosse was Clark lecturer of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1885-90, but his association with Cambridge did not end in that latter year. Evan Charteris writes that after Gosse's tenure as Clark lecturer a "series of uneventful years followed. He had much leeway to make up; patience and assiduity were needed. He turned with redoubled eagerness to his friends, courting, and not in vain, encouragement and support. For the rest, he continued his literary activities and his lectures." 7 There is no mention of a lecture on "the Literary Movement in England during the last hundred years" which he gave at "the summer meeting of the University Extension Society, at Cambridge, in August [1893]." His lecture, there given the title "The Literature of the Century," appeared in the sixth volume of The Bookworm (1893, pp. 357-360), submitted by an anonymous contributor who may have been at the lecture. If the lecture exists in print in toto I have been unable to find any reference to it. I quote the whole. On occasion of the summer meeting of the University Extension Society, at Cambridge, in August, Mr. Edmund Gosse lectured on the Literary Movement in England during the last hundred years. The lecturer expanded the view that since the revolt of the romantic system against the classic, in the beginning of the hundred years, no radical change had taken place in English literature up to the present time. He remarked:—"The first thing we need to obtain, if we are trying to analyse the literary movement of the century, is a clear sane impression, proportionate in all its parts, of what that movement has been. If Clough was part of it—why, so is Mr. Kipling; if the German philosophers influenced one end of it, it is quite equally certain that Ibsen and Norwegian drama influences the other end. It is very hard to do, but we should at least try to see the second just as plainly as the first. What we cannot, of course, attain, but what we should endeavour to climb towards, is a sort of Pisgah-height from which we can look at the hundred years of nineteenth-century literature winding like a river at our feet—one part as near, as distinct, as unclouded as another. As I say, we cannot quite manage to do this; but that is the attitude of mind desirable. "Well, if in measure, and so far our prejudiced and imperfect optics will permit, we do look down upon the literary history of England from 1793 to 1893 in this way, what do we see? I think I shall perhaps startle you a little if I confess that what I seem to see is a vast cascade, a sort of Niagara, at one end, and a remarkably calm and unruffled tide proceeding from the fall of this cascade to our very feet. To my vision, the first thing that strikes the attention is precisely this short and violent crisis or cataclysm, followed by a long stretch of almost unmodified calm. "You will immediately ask me if I am so blind as to see no individuals of genius breaking through the surface of the literary movement during, let us say, the last seventy years? Am I one of those, for instance, who declare that English poetry stopped with Crabbe, and that Sir Walter Scott was the last genuine novel-writer? Most certainly that is not my foible. I am no praiser of bygone days at the expense of our own, and I think that the middle of the nineteenth century was unusually full of great original names in literature. But this is not the point in question. We are speaking of the tendency of literary movement, and that is often curiously independent of personal genius. I will remind you of a very striking instance of this. If there is in English poetry a name which appears to every one of us synonymous with originality, with individuality, with genius in all its forms, it is that of Milton. But Milton is positively a negligible quantity, if we are considering the literary movement of the seventeenth century. He stood aloof from it, he exercised no influence over it, it dashed around him and left him behind it like a colossal rock—left him protesting against it by every line he wrote; whereas Waller and Cowley, poets of the third class, are more interesting to us (from this peculiar point of view) than the pure and majestic author of 'Paradise Lost.' "But I must now ask you what is to be the limit of our one hundred years—are we going to be very exact, and begin with 1793, or are we to take 1800 for our starting-point? The detail is an important one; for, according to my telescope, looking backwards from our Pisgah, the great crisis of movement took place during those seven years. Will you think me very paradoxical if I say that it seems to me that there was a more complete change made in English literature between 1793 and 1800 than between 1800 and 1893? "Let us now think for an instant what that change was. In 1793 the eighteenth century in literature, the old régime, was still alive; it showed no sign of change, no threatening of decay. Down through those seven years there continued to be whole bodies of intelligent and attentive persons who remained positively untouched by a single new idea. There is a very curious, and in its way a very charming, book which used to be a great favourite with our grandfathers—'The Diary of a Lover of Literature.' That journal was begun in 1796, and carried on for many years, by a young man called Thomas Green. The chief interest to us now in that book is that it belongs entirely to the old world, the world of Addison and Pope and Johnson, and that not a single sign exists in it to show that the very clever and erudite author had an idea that the standards of literary taste would ever be undermined. And yet, as we look back to those years in which he wrote, they seem to us not merely undermined but crashing about his ears. The blind forces of Romance took the pillars of the eighteenth century in their hands, and swayed to and fro, until the whole edifice crumbled in atoms." After a rapid survey of the condition of English literature at various moments in the course of the century, Mr. Gosse closed his discourse as follows:— "Let no one persuade us, inspired by antiquarianism on the one hand or by a cheap cynicism on the other, to underrate the richness, the variety, the splendid fulness and accomplishment of these hundred years. To have lived through our share of this magnificent time is, if our ears and eyes have been open, to have lived broadly and loftily. Nowhere else in the history of the world—not under Pericles or Augustus, not under Elizabeth or Louis XIV.—was so delicate and so various a literary banquet spread before the hunger of readers. In several solitary instances, without doubt—so far, at least, as we are able to trust our present impressions—a greater altitude has been reached by writers of bygone times. But nowhere in past history do we find so high a general level, nowhere such a persistency, for generation after generation, in moving with strenuous variety along the same great line of literary tendency. "To us all, however, the practical service of such a train of reflection as we have sought to follow to-night must be measured by the degree in which it adds pleasure and profit to our private reading. I am in hopes that a perception of the continuity in nineteenth-century authorship, which I have attempted to dwell upon, may add an enjoyment to your course of more extended study. To take a book and to read it as an isolated production, to absorb what entertainment and instruction it offers without regard to its relation to other books, may be a very delighful thing. But that delight is immensely increased, is made part of an organised system or a vertebrate structure, when we take the book in connection with what preceded and what followed it, as a link, in fact, in the long and beautiful chain of 'sweetness and light.' "I cannot help hoping that a consideration of the unity of purpose which marks all the most vital literature of the nineteenth century, its deliberate and persistent pursuit of what is genuine, natural, and vigorous, and its rejection of mere rhetoric and superficiality, will add to your pleasure in reading Coleridge and Browning, Thackeray and Stevenson, Charles Lamb and Carlyle. You will enjoy the characteristic variations of all these authors the more, because you see that, essentially, and wherever they are truly successful, they are moving along the same line of literary influence. And the interest to us must surely be the more vivid, because we know not at what moment a complete reorganisation of society may produce another crisis in literary history as unexpected, as complete, as that of 1793." Students of nineteenth-century English literature will make of this what they will. Extracts from Thomas Green's Diary were published in 1810 in Ipswich, his native city, and were continued in the Gentleman's Magazine from January 1834 to June 1843. William Roberts, described in the British Museum catalogue of printed books as "Writer on English Bookselling," was a fairly frequent contributor to at least the last two of the three periodicals under discussion. Of especial interest is a contribution to the last volume of The Bookworm (VII [1894], 81-82). It is entitled "A New Letter of Montaigne" and tells of a letter from Montaigne to Henri III of France in the Bibliothéque Nationale. The date of the letter is July 7, 1583, which places it before that of August 31, 1583, also to Henri III, described by Donald M. Frame as "Letter of Remembrance from the Mayor [Montaigne, of course] and Jurats of Bordeaux." 8 I quote the letter and Roberts's comments. The letter quoted below is dated July 7, 1583, and was written at that period of his life when his compatriots, recognising the value of his past services, elected him, for the second time, Mayor of Bordeaux. It was evidently in this year that Montaigne made a journey to the court to obtain from the king, in the interest of his city, an absolute suppression of the "traite foraine"—that is to say, the custom-house duty imposed on the imports into and exports from Bordeaux; and the desired order seems to have taken effect in July, 1583. Neither M. Alphonse Grün, "Vie Publique de Montaigne," nor M. Payen, in his "Recherches," makes any reference to Montaigne's Itinerary during the year 1583. The date and subject of the letter therefore furnish future biographers of the great essayist with the groundwork of some fresh materials. The letter is as follows:— Sire par ladvertissement que Jay eu en ce lieu de Moncornet Il semble que la fortune soffre a vous descharger de la promesse que vre bonte et liberalite ma faicte depuis peu de jours car Jay trouve entre les mains de mons' pinart une lre cy Incluse par laquelle on mande que le priore de Provins est vacquant par le trespas de M e Maurice de Commarcis et peut valoir de mil a douze cens livres ainsi que dit celuy qui en escrit.

Vre tres humble serviteur et suject Montaigne. The foregoing letter presents several questions not easily answered. There are (or were), for example, three Moncornets—one in the Aisne, a second in the Ardennes, and a third on the Oise. M. le Baron de Ruble, in his "Mémoires de la Huguerye" (1877-80), makes an interesting reference to the "pinart" of Montaigne's letter. Claude Pinard, Baron de Cremailles and secretary of the Maréchal Saint-André and of the king, was a favourite with Catherine de Medicis, and became Secretary of State in 1570. He was in great favour with Henri III., and often employed in diplomatic matters. He died on September 14, 1605. Maurice de Commartin, to whom Montaigne refers as Maurice de Commercis, was a prior. In regard to the word "prospérer" which occurs in Montaigne's letter, Littre, in his "Dictionnaire," only cites one example of its use in the sense here employed by Montaigne, namely, from the "Mémoires de Villeroy." The above letter therefore furnishes a second instance of the employment of this word in the sense of the Latin "prosperare." W. Roberts. Since Professor Frame did not know of the existence of this letter he could not address himself in his biography of Montaigne (1965) to the problems raised by it. I have made no effort to ascertain if there was post-1965 knowledge of the letter, my primary purpose being to redirect attention to these and other periodicals. Finally, in volume seven, in Part II of W. Carew Hazlitt's "English and Scottish Book Collectors" (1894, pp. 97-106), there is this notice under the name of Alexander Pope (p. 104): We have a very imperfect knowledge of the contents and extent of the poet's library. Books with his autograph sometimes occur. He is supposed to have had in his possession the unique copy of the old "Taming of a Shrew." 4to, 1594, now in the Devonshire Collection. Comp.

      <field name="heading_text">The Unrecognized Second Edition of Conrad's Under Western Eyes by David Leon Higdon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First editions enjoy a mystique in later years as copies become increasingly scarce, and collected editions proclaim a certain sumptuousness and finality; however, the workaday inexpensive editions often reveal more about a work's reputation, audience, and publication history than either of the former. Most collectors, for example, would rather have a cerise-embossed, gold-lettered copy of the English first edition of Under Western Eyes however faded, the rarest edition of any Conrad novel, 1 than a second edition, even though the latter involves a more revealing story of melted plates, misnamed impressions, and rising sales. Jocelyn Baines pointed out that Chance , the novel which marked the turning-point in Conrad's finances and popularity, unexpectedly sold 13,200 copies in England during the two years following its publication, compared with only 4,112 of Under Western Eyes— a superior novel in every way—during a comparable period. 2 Had the Methuen records and ledgers been fully available in the early 1960s, Baines could further have added that the popularity of Chance , Victory , and The Shadow-Line , whose first edition of 5,000 copies sold out in four days, 3 spurred on a 15,000 copy second edition of Under Western Eyes , the "Cheap Edition" published in 1917 by Methuen. The Cheap Edition has a particular significance because of what it did to Conrad's text and because it has heretofore been described as a reprint rather than a true second edition. It and its relationship to the first edition also offer a clear example of the corruption of a text and the necessity of distinguishing most carefully between editions and impressions. The first edition of 5 October 1911 consisted of 3,000 copies, 2,250 for domestic sale and 750 for the colonial market, differing from the domestic only by being bound in green cloth or paper wrappers rather than the cerise boards of the domestic copies. 4 A second impression (Methuen calls all the impressions "editions" 5 ) of 1,500 (1,000 domestic and 500 colonial) was ordered 20 September 1911, but, since one inspected copy includes a Methuen autumn catalogue dated September 1913, copies were obviously bound as the market required. 6 With only 4,112 copies sold between October 1911 and the end of 1913, Methuen had 388 copies left to carry sales through early 1915, an indication of Conrad's lack of drawing power at this time. The stock ledgers show that 100 copies were bound 15 November 1913, 100 more 7 April 1914, and 11 28 May 1915, so that the supply was virtually exhausted before Methuen took delivery of 1,013 copies of the third impression 11 June 1915. In a letter of 2 November 1911 to J. B. Pinker, Conrad mentions having seen advertisements of the "3rd ed" (that is, the third impression of the first edition), but the only copy located to date carries the date 1915 and includes an advertising catalogue dated 8 May 1915. 7 The Methuen ledgers contain the notations "M Dec 2/11", "S May 17/15" and "M destroyed 12/2/16", apparently referring to the creating of moulds, the stereotyping of plates, and the destroying of moulds 12 February 1916. 8 Before hurrying to the conclusion that the destruction of the moulds may also have involved the destruction of the plates of the first edition, thus necessitating the new edition ordered in May 1917, one must recognize that the "Sixth Edition" of April 1920 and the "Fourteenth Edition" of 1929 are actually the fourth and probably the firth impressions of the first edition plates. It is also probable that the "Tenth," "Thirteenth," and "Fifteenth" editions are later impressions as well, particularly since the ledgers carry the notation "M&amp;G" at the head of the entries for the "Fifteenth Edition," thus indicating that it was printed by Morrison and Gibbs, the printers of the first edition and its other impressions. Under Western Eyes was not the breakthrough to a larger audience that Chance was soon to become because of the popular audience's mood. E.D.Y., an unidentified reader, inscribed in his copy, the following: Of course a powerful book. Also a cruel book. Turgenev? Certainly not. Dostoievski. The Dostoievski of Crime et Chastisment. On the whole I regret I read this book. Life is too short to read such books. It is not instructive; it is not elevating—rather the reverse—; and it is not beautiful enough. I hope Conrad will now leave the uninteresting Russian conspirators, once and for all, and come back to the true source of his inspiration: the Wide Sea. 9 True, Under Western Eyes' pessimism and corrosive ironies, its maimed and deafened protagonist, would not have struck many readers during the Edwardian summer as being either "instructive" or "beautiful" and certainly not "elevating." The severe judgment of E.D.Y. apparently comes from a faithful reader of Conrad who most certainly had read The Secret Agent ("will now leave the uninteresting Russian conspirators, once and for all "), possibly The Nigger of the "Narcissus" , Lord Jim , certain short stories such as "Youth", and, conjecturally, even The Mirror of the Sea . The popular mood and Conrad's reputation had changed by the time of the Cheap Edition of 1917. In March, Methuen proposed an autumn shilling edition, and, on 3 July, Methuen wrote Pinker: "We presume that the author will not require to see proofs of the cheap edition of "UNDER WESTERN EYES". [¶] In dealing with Mr. Conrad's previous volumes in our cheap series, the printers have read the books for press and taken responsibility for the accuracy of the setting." 10 The Cheap Edition condensed the front matter and text of the novel from a total of 382 pages and 24 signatures to 320 pages and 10 signatures, a savings of 62 pages, and shrunk the thirty-five line, 187x124 mm. page to a forty-line, 170x116 mm. page. The format changes were due, in part, to wartime paper shortages and undoubtably reflected a desire to reduce production costs as well. October 1917 brought the true second edition, called the "Fourth Edition," in a printing of 15,000 copies; yet another 5,000 copies were called for in 1920. In 1922, Methuen changed the paper size and format from foolscap octavo to crown octavo and the binding from maroon cloth to green cloth for the third, fourth, and fifth impressions of the second edition, calling them the "Sixth," "Seventh," and "Eighth" Cheaper Editions, before returning to foolscap octavo for the sixth impression ("Ninth Edition"). Other impressions followed in August 1926, December 1926, July 1943, March 1946, 1948, and possibly in January 1925 and February 1929. Because no copies or descriptions of the latter two impressions have been located, it remains uncertain whether they belong to the first edition or the second edition line of descent.

"Thirteenth Edition" February 1929 The Cheap Edition of 1917, printed by Butler and Tanner, was the edition in which Under Western Eyes reached a fairly large audience, and, because the edition was most carelessly proofed, it perniciously subverts the text in a number of ways. The second edition differs from the first in 255 instances (53 substantives and 202 accidentals). 12 One need only glance at some of the typographical errors to wonder how the reader kept the identities of Razumov and Ivanovitch straight since they appear variously as "Rauzumov" (140.15), "Ruzamov" (159.28), and "Ivanovich" (180.33, 234.33), and such peculiar words as "busk" (16.27), "hrown" (16.28), "Geneal" (63.3), "Russiar" (184.40), "retierd" (185.17), "peopls" (186.30), and "Prnice" (260.16) appear where "dusk," "brown," "General," "Russian," "retired," "people," and "Prince" should be. Admittedly, the edition does correct "preresent" (53.18 to "represent"), as well as the two errors, mentioned earlier; however, many of its errors perversely "make sense" and often reverse Conrad's intended meaning. Though it is fairly evident to a reader that "you presence" (78.35), "colouring slight" (91.1), "her fate husband" (138.34), and "for five minutes of more" (286.27) are misprints for "your presence," "colouring slightly," "her late husband," and "for five minutes or more," one must always approach assumed misprints with caution. Since 1938, readers of Graham Greene's Brighton Rock have probably been silently "correcting" the detective's remark "'You're a wide boy'" to "'You're a wise boy'" without realizing that "wide" is underworld slang for "those who live by their wits, especially gamblers, petty swindlers, race-gangsters, the lesser 'con men', dishonest motor-car salesmen, and the like." 13 Equally troubling and ambiguous are those misprints which silently distort what the author wrote. For example, describing the attitude, stride, and demeanor of the red-nosed student, Conrad wrote "He stalked deliberately at Razumov's elbow" (M70.16), but in the Cheap Edition, he "talked deliberately" (64.31). In the first edition, Natalia Haldin tells the narrator of her troubles with her mother, concluding "'I am more uneasy than ever'" (M174.31); the Cheap Edition has her saying she is "more easy than ever" (151.15)—exactly the reverse. Similarly, the Cheap Edition prints "Miss" (268.11) instead of "Mrs." (M313.31)—a seemingly minor error, but one which assigns a significant evaluation by the narrator to the wrong character—and "foreseen" (287.7) for "unforeseen" (M337.6), making the perceived connection between Natalia and her brother rather puzzling. Elsewhere, the Cheap Edition prints "put new heart in the man" (108.28-29), "the loss" (268.32), and "sceptical ghost" (305.23) instead of "put heart in the new man" (M122.32-33), "the cost" (M314.19), and "sceptical guest" (M359.21). The first greatly weakens the image of Peter Ivanovitch's transformation from a near beast back into a "new man." The second ruins the metaphor of being wounded and counting "the cost," and the third momentarily seems to further the imagery of the supernatural which permeates the novel; however, Razumov is an all too physical guest. The Cheap Edition also omits a number of words and phrases, probably due to compositors' eyeskips. For example, "inspiration. It is a great privilege to have the inspiration and the opportunity" (M154.25-26) becomes "inspiration and the opportunity" (134.28-29), and "almost of the disciple of" (M159.1) becomes "almost of" (138.22). Sometimes, words such as "tawny" in "naked tawny figure" (M120.14/106.24) simply disappear from the text. When one turns to the accidental variants, one finds much the same story: 79 of the 202 variants are simple setting errors such as misspellings, use of a comma instead of a period, omission of closing punctuation, whereas others involve regularization of -ize words (4 times) and any one (15 times), preference of variant spellings (8 times), addition of commas (5 times), and deletion of commas (38 times), even though the text does correct twelve printing errors from the first edition. On 2 January 1942, Methuen melted down the stereotyped plates, probably of the first edition, though there is a possibility that the second edition plates were also melted down as part of the war effort, and on 4 March 1943, the blocks were destroyed. 14 Moulds surely had been made or "mother plates" retained, because there were later impressions ordered 7 July 1943, 6 March 1946, and sometime in 1948. Thus, during the thirty or so years following the publication of Under Western Eyes , Conrad's readers had their choice of any of four editions of the novel in Great Britain: the Methuen first, the Methuen second, the Heinemann Collected, or the Dent which was printed from plates of the American Sun-Dial Edition. Conrad met these readers, moreover, not in the precisely cut style and neatly punctuated sentences he wished, but in a rather tattered, shop-worn cheap text. It was cheap, and it often looked it. Had publication rights not finally passed to J. M. Dent, the text of the second edition might still be on sale in its various guises.</field>

Smith, Joseph Conrad: A Bibliographical Catalogue of his Major First Editions with Facsimiles of Several Title Pages ([San Francisco], 1979), pp. 114-115 for a ranking of "comparative scarcities." Smith ranks Some Reminiscences , Tales of Unrest , A Personal Record (American edition), and the co-authored The Inheritors as more scarce than copies of Under Western Eyes . 2 Jocelyn Baines, Joseph Conrad: A Critical Biography (1960), p. 380. 3 T. G. Ehrsam, A Bibliography of Joseph Conrad (1969), p. 307 notes the rapid sale of The Shadow-Line . American sales of Under Western Eyes were disappointing. Harper &amp; Brothers sold 1,976 copies in 1911, 737 in 1912, and did not sell out the first edition of 4,000 copies until 1917—an average of only 377 copies per year. Harpers' second printing of 1,000 copies lasted from March 1917 until 1924 when the book was dropped from the publishing list. This information was supplied by William R. Cagle from the early draft of a "Bibliography of Joseph Conrad," pp. 151-152. 4 These and subsequent figures are taken from the Methuen MSS, 1892-1944, Stock ledgers of the publishing records, Volumes 4-7 and 9, cited with permission of the Lilly Library, Indiana University, which acquired the records in 1968. Entries for Under Western Eyes appear in Volumes 4:199, 5:259, 6:352, 7:320, and 9:55. The entries note such things as the number of copies ordered, the number of copies bound, the amount of quire stock, the orders for wrappers, and occasionally indicate dates concerning moulds, stereotype plates, and blocks. The records, though, are incomplete. W. R. Cagle used the Methuen records concerning the first edition and its impressions in his bibliography, pp. 149-150, but erred in calling the second edition "a fourth printing" and Volume X of the Heinemann Collected the "second English edition." The Heinemann, the most restyled of all the editions of the novel, is actually the third English edition. 5 In A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), p. 317, Philip Gaskell uses Methuen's Winnie-the-Pooh (twenty-seven impressions between 1926 and 1941) as an example of a publisher's misleading use of "edition" for "impression." 6 Stock ledger 4:199 indicates that 1,306 copies were bound between 7 October 1911 and 3 January 1912. Were it possible to determine whether the entries in the "Received from Binders" columns run across the page or down the page, one could determine the exact number of the later impressions; however, there are too many inconsistencies in the entries for this to be done. 7 See Conrad to J. B. Pinker, 2 November 1911, Berg Collection, quoted with permission of the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, The New York Public Library, and the Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. Though Conrad may have seen such an advertisement, the third impression clearly did not materialize until July 1915. 8 Stock ledger 4:199. 9 Quoted with permission of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, Carlton Lake Collection. The inscription is dated "Nov 1911" and appears in a first edition, first impression copy. Carlton Lake obtained the book from the estate of Sisley Huddleston. Mrs. Huddleston, in old age, told Lake that the book had been given to Sisley Huddleston by E.D.Y. She could not remember E.D.Y.'s name but recalled that he was a prominent English literary journalist and friend. I wish to thank Cathy Henderson of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center for supplying the information about the provenance of the copy. 10 Methuen to Pinker, quoted with permission of the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, The New York Public Library, and the Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. 11 Extant figures are not available for the impressions of February 1923, September 1924, or January 1925, but they may be assumed to range between 1,000 and 5,000 since the 1,000 copy October 1922 impression needed replenishing by February 1923, and the sixth and seventh impressions were necessary to meet demand following the 5,000 copy May 1924 impressions. Conrad's death 3 August 1924 probably helped spur sales through 1925 and 1926. * There are two "Sixth Editions," the fourth impression of the First Edition and the third impression of the Second Edition. ** The "Tenth" and "Thirteenth" may actually be the fifth and sixth impressions. *** The copyright page of the "Ninth Edition" cites April 1924 as the date of publication for the fifth impression. 12 The "Fifth" and "Seventh" editions were collated against the first impression of the first edition, and the "Fifth," "Seventh," and "Eleventh" were machine collated against one another. Collation revealed no variants within the second edition impressions other than plate damage such as can be expected from large runs. The first edition is abbreviated M. Stock ledger 7:320 indicates that the plates were recast 16 October 1926. 13 Brighton Rock (New York, 1938), p. 91. "Wide boy" also appears in the English first (1938), Penguin (1943), Uniform (1947) and Collected (1975) editions. For a discussion of the full textual history of this novel, see my "'I Try to be Accurate': The Text of Greene's Brighton Rock ," forthcoming in the inaugural issue of The Graham Greene Annual Review . The definition cited is that of Eric Partridge, A Dictionary of the Underworld (1950), p. 772. Mary Renault's The Charioteer (1959), contains another example of the somewhat rare usage: "Toto Phelps and Bunny have been honeymooning for two full weeks now; anyone could have told him Toto's one to get very nasty if he's two-timed, but all these wide boys get swelled head" (p. 373, italics added). 14 The plates were undoubtedly melted down during the wartime shortages of lead. It seems fairly certain, though, that the moulds were not destroyed, hence making possible the three further impressions of 1943, 1946, and 1948. An alternative explanation would have Methuen maintaining "mother plates" (see Gaskell, pp. 204-205).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Faulkner's "Impressions" of "Danzas Venezuela": The Original Manuscript by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In April, 1961, under the auspices of the Department of State, William Faulkner made a two-week visit to Venezuela as a cultural emissary of the United States government. On Thursday morning, April 6, in Caracas, at the Ministry of Education, he accepted that country's most coveted civilian award, the Order of Andrés Bello. 1 And on that same evening, in the company of Mr. and Mrs. William Fielden, Faulkner's son-in-law and step-daughter with whom he was also staying, and with others from the American entourage, he attended a performance of indigenous music and dancing at the Teatro Municipal. 2 The performance itself was divided into various acts, one of which had its première and was dedicated to William Faulkner. This act, inspired by three poems composed by Andrés Eloy Blanco, consisted of three dances which had been choreographed by Mrs. Paulina Ossona. Later that evening, perhaps backstage or at the formal dinner party given by Dr. and Mrs. Arturo Uslar Pietri, the lady in charge of the production, Mrs. Isabel Aretz de Ramón y Rivera, made a request of the celebrated American author that he put in writing his "impressions" of their offering. 3 Even had Faulkner considered the request that he write this occasional piece a nuisance, doubtless he would have felt a sincere obligation to give it his best effort; after all, he regarded his position as cultural representative of the United States and his presence in Venezuela as matters of State importance. Furthermore, protocol demanded of him nothing less than compliance. Possibly the following day, working from a general outline of "Notes" most likely supplied him by his assigned interpreter Hugh Jencks, and drawing upon felicitous impressions from the previous evening, Faulkner composed a one-paragraph, 202-word encomium celebrating the occasion. And in the end, the impressions to which he did give written form, ostensibly intended to extol a specific event, became an eloquent tribute to the people of Venezuela. 4 An examination of the one-page, blue ballpoint ink holograph manuscript on which Faulkner's impressions of "Danzas Venezuela" are recorded reveals that in contemplating his subject, Faulkner initially was struck by one key phrase and that he set it down as if it were to be his first paragraph: "I saw the spirit &amp; history of Venezuela caught and held for a moment with skill and grace, in bright and happy motion". Actually, this phrase would set the tenor and the focus for his overall impression which would address itself toward the widest possible audience and attempt to lend to it a universal application. Having written three lines into his second paragraph, Faulkner seemed to sense that the real significance of the three "poem-dances" (Jencks had referred to them as such in his "Notes") performed in his honor was as vessels, conduits for Venezuela's entire history and spirit. Breaking off his third sentence, Faulkner drew a line from it up to the top of the sheet and formed a bracket containing the first two lines of the original "key phrase" with which he had begun to record his impressions; the result was to prepare their fusion into what eventually would become a similar, though more highly stylized and expanded, opening for his final version. Faulkner's third paragraph consisted of seven lines devoted to expressing his appreciation of the principals involved in the performance. This concluded, he was ready to condense, compress, and blend all the strands he had provisionally recorded in his first three paragraphs. The fourth "paragraph" on the sheet represents Faulkner's fused draft; actually, rather than being an isolated paragraph, it forms a version that approximates completeness and in the apparent absence of other extant manuscripts or drafts, forms the most advanced self-contained version of the author's impressions on this specific subject. Whether Faulkner revised the present preserved draft before his "impressions" were conveyed to Mrs. Ramón y Rivera is not known. At least only the "Notes," presumably typed by Hugh Jencks, and Faulkner's original single sheet of holograph starts and "final draft" have survived. The texts of these two documents are transcribed below for the first time. 5 Notes [by Hugh Jenks?] which may be of help in writing a few lines on "Danzas Venezuela." 6 The group is sponsored and its expenses defrayed by the Cultural and Social Welfare Section of the Ministry of Labor. The dancers receive training at the School of Artistic Formation (Development), whose directress is Mrs. Isabel Aretz de Ramón y Rivera, the determined lady of stentorian voice who asked if you would "write a few lines" about your impressions of the Thursday performance. The three poem-dances which formed one group were given their premiere in your honor. They were "Hilandera" (The Spinning Woman or Weaver), "Silencio" (Silence) and "Giraluna" (a coined name which doesn't mean anything), three poems by Andrés Eloy Blanco, Venezuelan poet who died several years ago. The choreography was done by Paulina Ossona (Mrs.), of Argentina, who has been working with the Danzas Venezuela group recently. It is my impression that what Mrs. Ramón y Rivera would like is not necessarily something referring specifically to the individual numbers on last night's program, but rather something of a general nature on your impressions which they could proudly reproduce on programs and in literature about the group. I put down the specific data merely as background. I saw the spirit &amp; history of Venezuela caught and held for a moment ['in bri' del. ] with skill and grace, in bright and happy motion [ transferred by guideline to follow 'to see the' at end of the next paragraph ] Of course I was aware of the honor which was offered me, but ever since I reached Venezuela I had been offered ['honors' del. ] the warmest of sympathy and honors, and so I was not surprised by it this time. What I experienced was more than the honor. It was this opportunity to see the ['I saw . . . motion' brought down by guideline ] This done with grace and skill by the young men and women who gave the impression that they did it for love of it, for their pride in the spirit and history of their country which they showed to the foreigner who will take home with him that remembrance, ['never to forget the gesture' del. ] and with fuller knowledge of Venezuela which he had already come to admire, never to forget the gesture nor the inspiration of it, or the young men and women ['who performed it' del. ] from [ ab. del. 'in'] the *poetry [ ab. del. 'words'] of Andres Blanco ['&amp; senora Oss' del. ] which senora Ossona portrayed so wonderfully, nor senora Ramon y Rivera who directed it and the young men &amp; women who performed it. I thank them all. Anyone who had received as many honors as myself since reaching Venezuela, might have supposed that there was no new honor he could be worthy of. He would have been wrong. In this performance of Danzas Venezuela I saw not merely another warm and generous honor, *gesture from one American country to a visitor from another one, [ intrl. ] I saw the spirit and history of Venezuela caught and held ['for a moment' del. ] in a bright and ['happy' del. ] warm moment of grace and skill and happiness, by the young men and women who gave me the impression that they were doing it out of love for what they were doing, to show to this stranger, this foreigner, so that he could carry back home with him the ['remembrance of' del. ] fuller poetic knowledge of a country which he had already come to admire ['and respect' del. ], never to forget the gesture nor the inspiration of it from the poetry of Andres Blanco and the other Venezuelan poets whose ['names' del. ] perhaps had no names, which senora Ossona translated * into spectacular and significant [ ab. del. 'so wonderfully into'] motion, nor senora Ramon y Rivera who directed it and the young men and women who performed it. He thanks them all. He will not forget ['it nor them.' del. ] the experience nor those who made it possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See Louis Daniel Brodsky, "The 1961 Andrés Bello Award: William Faulkner's Original Acceptance Speech," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 277-281. 2 See Faulkner: A Biography , by Joseph Blotner (1974). The notes accompanying pages 1779-1786 detailing Faulkner's Venezuelan trip in April 1961 appear on pages 213-214 of the Notes section of the second volume. Blotner cites "Charles Harner, American Embassy, Caracas, to Dept. of State, 27 Apr. 1961; Hugh Jencks, 'Report to the North American Association on the Visit of Mr. Faulkner,'" as his sources for the description of events and for the specific fact that Faulkner "wrote out a short speech of thanks to the dancers." But Blotner does not date the Jencks' report (it was May 10, 1961) and he supplies no supporting evidence that Faulkner ever delivered a "speech." Furthermore, from the information disclosed in footnote 3 below, it would seem unlikely that Faulkner had his thoughts formulated in time to present them that night to the dancers; in fact, not earlier than Friday, April 7, 1961. 3 From the reference to "last night's program," there seems little question that the sheet containing "Notes which may be of help in writing a few lines on 'Danzas Venezuela'," was typed out on Friday, April 7, 1961, and given to Faulkner, doubtless by Hugh Jencks, his interpreter and go-between. This sheet and the holograph manuscript of Faulkner's impressions of "Danzas Venezuela," cited below in footnote 4, were clipped together, apparently as they had been joined and set aside by Faulkner twenty-four years before I discovered them. 4 I found both the "Notes" cited in footnote 3 and this holograph document while examining myriad family effects and artifacts in the possession of Victoria Fielden Johnson, daughter of William and Victoria Franklin Fielden, Faulkner's son-in-law and step-daughter, his hosts on that 1961 trip to Caracas, Venezuela. I am deeply indebted to Victoria F. Johnson for graciously welcoming me on my visit to her in Cape Coral, Florida, from May 20-24, 1985, and for letting me inspect and acquire these and various other documents, letters, manuscripts, and photographs relating to William Faulkner and his family which formerly had belonged to her parents. 5 I wish to acknowledge my appreciation of Jill Faulkner Summers for allowing me to make public the texts of the outline and William Faulkner's "impressions" of "Danzas Venezuela," as well as all other items in my Faulkner collection in intervening scholarly publications which call attention to the multi-volume series, Faulkner: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brodsky Collection , edited by Louis Daniel Brodsky and Robert W. Hamblin, and in which subsequently they will appear. 6 The system of transcription is that recommended by Fredson Bowers, "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants," Studies in Bibliography , 29 (1976), 212-264.</field>
