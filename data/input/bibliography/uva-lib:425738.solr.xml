      <field name="heading_text">The Treatment of Typesetting and Presswork in Bibliographical Description by G. THOMAS TANSELLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The printing-shop activities collectively called typesetting and presswork leave physical traces—in addition to the intended type—impressions of textual matter—in the finished products of those shops, and such traces are therefore available for recording by descriptive bibliographers. These details have not, however, been extensively reported in bibliographies, often because theyhave been regarded as lying outside the scope of such works. “ Typesetting ” (or “composition”) 1 obviously encompasses the work of one ormore compositors at their type-cases, setting the types into composingsticks and then shifting the composed type, a few lines at a time, to galleys we may also let the term cover such related decisions (not made by compositors) as whether to compose the pages in their numerical order or by formes. “Presswork” may loosely be defined as the routines that occur between the setting of type and the folding and gathering of printed sheets. It would thus include such events (when they occur) as the combining of composed type with skeleton-formes (containing recurrent running-titles), the determination of which forme of a sheet is to be printed first, the arranging of the furniture around the imposed type-pages in the forme, the fastening of sheets on tympan-points, the insertion of press figures, the making of stop-press alterations in the standing type, the progressive shifting and deterioration of individual types and ornaments (or progressive damage to plates and woodcuts), and the working up of quads and bearers so that they leave impressions on the sheets. Although occurrences of this kind produce visible evidence , much of it was not meant to be noticed or was even (as in the case of type damage or the impressions made by quads) not meant to exist; and descriptive bibliographers (who inevitably must make a selection of visual characteristics to be noted) have frequently felt that such details could reasonably be omitted. The fact that the analysis of compositorial spelling and of skeleton-formes, for example, has largely been undertaken by analytical bibliographers as a prerequisite to scholarly editing, and the fact that textual press-variants must obviously be examined by editors, have reinforced the notion that typesetting and presswork details are more relevant to analytical bibliography and editing than to descriptive bibliography. Such a view, however, misconceives the relationships among all three; and a more thoughtful consideration of whether typesetting and presswork details belong in a descriptive bibliography forces one to examine the connections between analysis and description. The reason that “ analytical bibliography” and “descriptive bibliography” are frequently spoken of as if they were separate fields has more to do with their endproducts than with their methods. Bibliographical analysis—the process of analyzing and drawing conclusions from physical evidence in books— often results in articles and books that concentrate on specific problems. A bibliographical description, on the other hand, is an account of an entire book; it may include detailed analyses of particular features, but in its totality it must encompass (on whatever level of detail has been selected) a whole book. The descriptive bibliographer, like the author of any other kind of broadly conceived work, may not realistically be able to pursue detailed analyses of every aspect of the subject to be treated; but any analyses that have already been performed constitute part of the evidence that must be dealt with. Descriptive bibliography, in other words, employs analytical bibliography as one of its tools—a point recognized by Fredson Bowers in the opening chapter of Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), where he states that it is “the basic function of a descriptive bibliography to present all the evidence about a book which can be determined by analytical bibliography applied to a material object” (p. 34; cf. p. 31). 2 What is generally thought of as description is not, in any case, a fully separate process from analysis. Describing what one sees without any interpretation is not always possible, for we all bring to acts of observation a repertoire of experiences and associations that we often employ, almost instinctively, in accounting for what we “see”; but even when pure observation can apparently occur, it is often unrevealing until it is analyzed in the light of an accumulated body of relevant inductive evidence. A descriptive bibliography employing the strictest sense of description would not be as useful as descriptive bibliographies generally are; despite their name, descriptive bibliographies are regularly and properly more than descriptive. Some details in them may result from seemingly pure observation, such as the dimensions of a leaf, the direction of the chainlines relative to the leaf, or the conjugacy of certain leaves; but a statement of format is a conclusion based on analysis, and it refers less to what one can actually see than to a process of imposition, printing, and paper-folding that took place before the book became the object that is now viewable. Reconstructing sequences of printing-shop events involved in the production of specific books is an activity associated with the style of analytical bibliography that has developed over the course of the twentieth century as an essential ingredient in scholarly editing. This “New Bibliography,” as it was once called, differed from what preceded it in the degree of its emphasis on kinetic analysis—that is, analysis that deals not simply with identifying visual details (such as recognizing a particular type-design) but instead with inferring the actions of human beings that led to the specific array of physical evidence now before our eyes. 3 Thus patterns of variations in spelling, for example, can lead to inferences about which sections of text were set by one compositor rather than another; and patterns in the recurrence of specific settings of runningtitles can indicate how many skeleton-formes were in use. That such details have largely been turned up in connection with textual investigations does not alter the fact that they are contributions to printing history. And it can scarcely be argued that any aspects of the printing history of a book are irrelevant to the bibliographical description of that book, for it has long been established that scholarly descriptive bibliographies on the highest level should aim to do more than simply provide a means for identifying editions, impressions, and issues. If they are to go beyond that function and offer histories of the production , finished appearance, and publication of particular editions, they not only must give fully rounded descriptions (recording details that are the same in all copies as well as those that vary); 4 they must also draw on all available evidence, both internal and external. Bibliographies regularly report information from copyright records and printers' and publishers' archives—information (reliable or not) that is often of a kind not inferrable from books themselves, such as their retail prices and publication dates or the number of copies printed. But in the process of supplementing internal evidence with external, bibliographers should not neglect the kind of internal evidence that is usually associated with the work of analytical bibliographers. The information it can disclose is just as much a part of the story as publication dates and edition sizes. The criticisms that have been made of analytical bibliography in recent decades have no bearing on these points. One category of criticism simply reflects distaste for the perceived attitudes of the New Bibliographers and their focus on authorial intention; 5 it is easily dismissed since the validity of bibliographical analysis is a separate issue from the tone with which it is presented or the choice of editorial rationale within which the results of such analysis are employed. Another line of criticism , which has to be taken more seriously, does question the logical validity of bibliographical analysis as a procedure and the reliability of its results. 6 But pointing out instances of careless analyses and erroneous conclusions does not invalidate the approach itself, for the inductive search through the mass of physical evidence in books is the only way we have for attempting to extract some of the wealth of information embedded there. And although induction cannot lead to absolute certainty , it can, when handled sensitively and cautiously, contribute to a body of what may responsibly be called facts (which must always be tentative). In any event, the risks that must be confronted in bibliographical analysis are the same as those that face all reconstructors of the past. Descriptive bibliographers, like other historians, are constantly faced with questions of interpretation that require their informed judgment . Incorporating bibliographical analysis, or the results of it, into bibliographical descriptions does not inject into them anything epistemologically different from what is there in any case. This point, furthermore , applies just as much to the details drawn from external sources as to those derived from the books under examination, for archival documents are no easier to use, and no more foolproof in what they seem to be saying, than is the physical evidence found within books. This line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that descriptive bibliographers have no valid theoretical reasons for excluding the kinds of details, such as those concerning typesetting and presswork, that have generally been considered the province of analytical bibliography. Whether in practice any given descriptive bibliographer decides to include them depends both on the nature of the material being treated and on the scale of the bibliography, as defined by the bibliographer. At the least it can be said that every descriptive bibliographer should consider the possibility of recording such details. Whether or not they are also analyzed, they can provide an initial body of evidence for other analysts. The descriptive bibliographer may sometimes use the results of previously published analyses, at other times engage in new analyses, and at still other times simply report relevant details without drawing conclusions—but in every case must employ well-considered evidentiary standards (which of course should be followed in every other aspect of the undertaking as well). The first prerequisite, however, is for bibliographers to abandon their all-too-common feeling (which exists largely through their failure to examine the matter) that such details are not properly part of bibliographical descriptions. Those details are perhaps the most obvious indication that the description is imbued with a knowledge of the book-production process, which should underlie everything the bibliographer places on record. I am not aware of any descriptive bibliography that includes information on typesetting (as opposed to typography), and the only one, to my knowledge, that regularly includes a paragraph labeled “Presswork” in its entries is David L. Vander Meulen's A Descriptive Bibliography of Alexander Pope's DUNCIAD, 1728-1751 (1981). 7 This feature is just one of the innovative aspects of that pioneering dissertation, which deserves to be better known. His presswork paragraphs deal, as necessary, with one or more of four topics—first-forme impressions, point-holes, running-titles, and press figures. Two other landmark books that serve as major repositories of forms for reporting bibliographical evidence are Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) and Peter W. M. Blayney's The Texts of KING LEAR and Their Origins (1982). Blayney's book is particularly useful for this purpose, with its appendixes on identifiable types, recurrent headlines, and press variants, and its trenchant commentary on the procedures involved in this kind of work should be required reading. In the following pages, I shall draw substantially on the work of Vander Meulen and Blayney as relevant. What I propose is to make suggestions about the treatment, first, of two kinds of evidence ( identifiable types and spelling variations) that are relevant to three aspects of the typesetting stage: whether the type was set by formes (rather than in page-number order), what type-case units were used, and how many compositors set the type. Then, under the heading of “Presswork,” I shall comment on typographical variations, impressions made by materials that were not meant to print, variations in furniture width, plating evidence, and the four categories of presswork evidence cited by Vander Meulen. The techniques thus far developed for analyzing typesetting are applicable mainly to books of the hand-press period; but several of the kinds of presswork evidence taken up here can be found in nineteenth- and twentieth-century books as well. (The analysis of paper, which has an extensive literature of its own, is not discussed here except when it occasionally enters into the analysis of presswork, since for the most part it is appropriately reported in the paragraph of a description dealing with paper.) Whether the result of examining these kinds of evidence should form a separate paragraph (or more than one) in a bibliographical description, or be incorporated into one of the now standard paragraphs, is something that each bibliographer must decide on the basis of what seems most convenient and reasonable in the given situation. In any case, the guiding principle is that forms for recording information ought to reflect understanding and promote further discovery . I. Typesetting The determination of whether a book was set by formes, as well as the identification of the type-case units from which certain pages were set (and in turn the shops where they were set), can often be made with certainty; but the history of attempts to identify pages set by different compositors shows how fraught with difficulty that effort is. These endeavors are extremely time-consuming and productive of unwieldy evidence. Whether or not descriptive bibliographers can reasonably be expected to include the full evidence in their descriptions (and it would not be unreasonable in every situation), they should at least understand the importance of offering some commentary on the matter. The kinds of evidence primarily employed—damaged types and variable spellings—are in some ways similar to those used in certain categories of presswork analysis, but there is an important difference that should be kept in mind. The relevant type damage is damage that (at least in part) remains constant, so as to serve as an identifier of a particular piece of type; even undamaged types that remain undamaged, if they are of the wrong font or otherwise anomalous, can—in combination with each other or in conjunction with other identifiable types—help to identify a particular font associated with a given shop. And the spelling and layout variations relevant to compositor analysis are spelling and spacing inconsistencies in different parts of a book. In contrast, for presswork analysis the apposite type damage would be damage that first occurs or becomes progressively worse during the course of printing and thus is not identical in different copies, and the spelling variants would be those occurring at a single spot in different copies (they would be simply one category of stop-press alterations). (a) Identifiable types One way in which individual pieces of type can be identified is through the damage they sometimes suffer, either in the casting process or in subsequent use—as long as the damage is distinctive enough that there is no possibility of confusing it with that of another damaged type of the same letter. (In practice, the images of standard letterforms are primarily employed, and I shall concentrate on them here, but with a few added comments later on other typographic elements.) Although damaged types are not necessarily useful in identifying compositors (since the argument would involve showing that compositors always set from the same cases), 8 they can be decisive in determining whether the typesetting was done in page-number order (seriatim) or by formes (that is, according to the type-pages that would be on the press at the same time). Hinman, in a classic article of 1955, made clear how such a demonstration could be conducted; and by proving that certain gatherings of the Shakespeare First Folio were set by formes, he made a major contribution to printing history, for seriatim setting had previously been assumed for all books except page-for-page reprints. He thus inaugurated a considerable flurry of research, in which other scholars discovered evidence of setting by formes in other books of the period, and in other formats. 9 The procedure, which can lead to demonstrable proof, is based on the fact that, in seriatim setting, no piece of type could be reused in any of the pages that would have to be set before a complete forme was available to be put on the press. For example, in a folio in sixes (like the First Folio)—in which each gathering consists of three quired sheets, producing six leaves or twelve pages—no piece of type could reappear within the first seven pages of a gathering, since that many would have to be set before a full forme (the inner forme of the inner sheet) would be ready for the press. If an identifiable piece of type does reappear earlier, then the setting could not have been seriatim. Instead, it would have had to involve “casting off copy” (estimating the amount of copy that would fit on certain pages) in order to make possible the setting of selected pages out of numerical order, specifically the pages needed for a single complete forme. The motivations for setting by formes could have in- cluded saving type (since seven double-column folio pages would have involved tying up a great deal of type) or completing a book more quickly (by allowing printing to start sooner). 10 But the price paid for such benefits was the likelihood that the casting-off would not be accurate and that compositors would have to make adjustments to compensate for those inaccuracies. Thus the presence of unusually crowded or spacious typesetting—on those pages that had to be made to end at a preassigned point in the text—offers supporting evidence that copy had been cast off for setting by formes; but such evidence cannot be conclusive by itself, whereas evidence from damaged types can indeed be conclusive. Blayney has shown, however, that arriving at a conclusive demonstration for a quarto is more difficult than for a folio because quarto formes contain less text and thus potentially less evidence than folio formes. Yet he was able to achieve sufficient density of evidence for analyzing the first quarto of King Lear by tracing over two thousand appearances of nearly six hundred identifiable types, and he could conclude decisively that the book was set seriatim. Although he presents his complex evidence clearly, there is no way that it could be recorded simply: he uses a “distribution table” for each sheet, showing how many of the identifiable types on each page of it came from each of the immediately preceding six formes (pp. 89-150), supplemented by a 36-page appendix listing the specific types both in alphabetical order and in page order (pp. 504-539). Hinman had previously used a similar three-part presentation for the First Folio, his tables appearing throughout Volume 2 and his appendix requiring 66 pages (1: 425-490), plus another seventeen on reappearing center rules (1: 491-507). When the evidence supporting conclusions about the manner of setting is of this magnitude and already published, a descriptive bibliographer cannot be expected to do more than report the conclusions and provide a reference to where the full evidence can be found. Even when the evidence is less extensive and published in an article, it would still be a wasteful duplication for a descriptive bibliographer to repeat all of it. But what one can legitimately expect a descriptive bibliographer to do is evaluate any previous work on the subject and provide a critical summary of the present state of research, perhaps including a selection of the evidence. 11 If no previous work has been done, or none that seems convincing, the bibliographer should be encouraged to conduct such an investigation—which, after all, is likely to lead to more satisfyingly definite conclusions than the attempt to identify compositors (as we shall see below) and thus perhaps more worth the great effort involved. That this suggestion will be seen as unrealistic is an indication of how unaccustomed bibliographers are to thinking of typesetting analysis as an integral part of a description. Bibliographers are of course free to set as they wish the precise limits of their research in any given instance; but the amount of work involved would not seem so unreasonable if there were a wider recognition that determining the order in which pages were set is not outside the scope of a description. There is another important use to which the evidence of damaged types can be put: it can contribute to the profile of a specific font of type—the particular assemblage of types constituting the contents of one set of cases (upper and lower). Although the basic idea of identifying type-case units in this way was Hinman's, it was given remarkable development by Adrian Weiss in two landmark articles in 1990 and 1991. 12 Weiss showed how one can identify certain types, even though they are undamaged, by virtue of their being used in conjunction with each other. Wrong-font letters, for example, can enter a type-case unit by accident or they can be placed there intentionally to replenish a depleted or damaged supply of type, but if they remain and are routinely used as part of that particular font, they become identifying characteristics of it, along with the damaged types. With sufficient study, therefore, one can identify the various type-case units from which type was drawn for setting a given book and can associate each of them with specific pages. The result is of course not the same as identifying compositors, for a compositor cannot be assumed to have used the same type-cases consistently and exclusively. 13 The kinds of evidence relevant to the two concerns are very different. Type-case units can be identified with greater confidence because there are fewer variables involved in recognizing groups of associated identifiable types than in deciding which of the idiosyncrasies in the deployment of types are attributable to compositors' habits (rather than accidents or the exigencies of the moment). But the two kinds of investigation should not be regarded as totally independent: even if compositorial stints cannot be equated with groups of pages set from different type-case units, one can at least hold the working hypothesis that a single proposed stint should not include pages set from different type-case units (though occasional mixing of type between cases must be allowed for, especially in instances of serious type-shortages). And if one can show that a given type-case unit belonged to a different printing shop from that named on the title page, one has even stronger grounds for this hypothesis. 14 The determination of the shops that possessed the type-case units, once those units have been identified, involves considerable effort, for obviously one must examine many books with different printers' names stated in them; but Weiss has shown how fruitful such examination can be. Indeed, one of his main contributions is to alert bibliographers to the possibility that anonymous shared printing occurred in the production of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century British books more often than had previously been thought. And the identification of the printing shops responsible for a given book is surely an important element in a bibliographical description. Weiss's work takes descriptive bibliography explicitly into account. In his 1991 article, he explains at the outset how the determination of the printer or printers of a book (going beyond a mere acceptance of a printer's name on a title page) is fundamental both for bibliographical description and for scholarly editing, since both activities rest on as great an understanding as can be achieved, for each relevant book, of “the circumstances of its production” (p. 183). He properly sees the function of descriptive bibliography as recording not only the “physical characteristics” of a book and “corresponding inferences about its printing history” but also “details which may contribute to the general understanding of early printing” (p. 184)—or, one may add, the printing of any period. The implication of this view is that even if one cannot positively identify the printer (or sharing printers) responsible for a given book, any “divisions of labor” that can be recognized, along with other typographical characteristics (such as those that are used in a typography paragraph in a bibliographical description), should be recorded as “initial clues to the identity of a font,” which other investigators will regard as “of utmost importance in the printer-search process” (p. 185). With Weiss's valuable practical hints for pursuing such work as an exemplary guide, bibliographers of all periods should be encouraged to extrapolate from his carefully stated principles and to regard their descriptions as repositories of typographical information. 15 Such information can of course come from all printed images, including those of ornaments (headpieces, tailpieces, factotums, and ornamental capitals), rules, and punctuation marks, as well as of basic letterforms. But the latter are the most helpful for typesetting analysis because they constitute, in most pieces of printing, a much larger body of usable evidence. Ornaments and rules can certainly be distinctively damaged, and an identifiable recurrence can in some instances be as revealing as a recurrent standard letterform, but naturally there are not as many opportunities for ornaments and rules to be reused. And the commonest punctuation marks, though they occur more frequently than ornaments, do not suffer readily distinguishable damage as often as letterforms: commas and periods especially, given their shapes, offer more limited scope for identifiable damage, and one cannot always say with confidence that two seemingly identical images of a damaged comma or period were produced by the same type. Identifiable ornaments, when they do turn up, can sometimes provide additional evidence—along with that from font analysis—for recognizing work from particular shops; but the ease with which these items could be shared underscores the need for great caution in making such identifications. (See Blayney's acknowledgment of this point in the record of identifiable ornaments in Appendix III of his Texts of KING LEAR, pp. 432-503, and Weiss's comments on ornament damage and borrowing in his 1991 article, pp. 191-203.) McKerrow also warned (in An Introduction to Bibliography, 1927) of the dangers of assuming that ornaments between text units (“outside the text-page”) were necessarily put in place when the text was set (p. 33); they may not, therefore, furnish any compositorial evidence at all (but rather may reflect the imposition stage). In the end, although one should remember that identifiable recurrences of any typographic materials are potentially useful, one may realistically expect that the letterform images will play a larger role than other images in the analysis of typesetting. One example of a concise pattern for combining the details thus far discussed may be in order: TYPESETTING. Set by formes throughout (see [ citation ] from three type-case units, two of them (I, II) in the shop of —— (as named on the title page) and the other (III) in the shop of —— (see [ citation ]). The formes set from each type-case unit are as follows: I: A(i), B(i), C(i), D(o); II: A(o), B(o), C(o), D(i); III: E-G. This is intended only as an illustrative specimen, not as a pattern for others to force their evidence into. Situations vary so greatly that each bibliographer will have to decide how best to place this kind of detail into the context of a particular descriptive bibliography. But the underlying principle to be kept in mind is that a description is an appropriate central site for typographical (as for other book-production) evidence; usably presented details—or citations of previous gatherings of them in printed or electronic form—are valuable elements in the cumulative body of observation on which printing historians can draw. (b) Spelling and layout variations Tracing inconsistencies in spelling through a book is one of the oldest techniques of bibliographical analysis: the theory is that, if a word is repeatedly spelled one way in one part of a book and another way in another part, these spellings may reflect the habits of different typesetters who set different sections of the book. If other varying spellings (and punctuation practices) fall into clusters that coincide with the same sections, the conclusion that one has identified the characteristics of two different compositors is of course strengthened. And features of layout over which typesetters had control (as they often did in Elizabethan and Jacobean times over the style of speech headings, the placement of stage directions, and the spacing of scene headings in plays) can be used in the same way to help work up profiles of individual compositors' habits. 16 In this process, one must naturally be aware of situations in which a compositor's usual habits might be less likely to operate (as in instances of type shortages or in justified lines, where uncharacteristic spellings might be used to make the lines fit), 17 and one must recognize the possibility that a page set by one compositor was corrected by another. This approach to the determination of how many compositors set a given book (and which pages each of them set) is clearly a promising one. But in practice it has frequently led to results that are easily contested. One recognizes, of course, that as an inductive procedure it can produce only hypotheses, not certainties; but the range of variables involved, the multiplicity of evidence to be examined, and the numerous alternative possibilities it presents for arrangement into patterns have caused hypotheses about compositor identification to be perhaps the most easily overturned hypotheses in all bibliographical analysis. Nevertheless, the examination of spelling and layout evidence must continue; and if it is to be performed at the most rigorous level, it requires a consideration of all spellings, spacings, and design choices, not a selective search based on some prematurely formed notion of what appears to be significant. Descriptive bibliographers, in dealing with this matter as with all others, must use their critical judgment to decide how strongly to support the results of particular compositor analyses, whether performed by others or by themselves. When previous analyses, and possibly conflicting ones, exist, descriptive bibliographers should study the evidence and present informed critical summaries of the situation. Whether or not they should perform additional independent investigations of their own—or perform the initial ones in instances where no previous analysis has been published—is a matter that each bibliographer will have to determine. This kind of analysis is extremely time-consuming, and some bibliographers will decide that as a practical matter they must limit themselves to assessing any previous analyses rather than making new tabulations on their own. But what they should not decide is that they can ignore the subject altogether. Given the possibilities for compositor analysis that exist, primarily but not exclusively in books of the hand-press period, 18 and the large body of work illustrating cautious and incautious ways of approaching such evidence, 19 descriptive bibliographers cannot simply avoid the topic as if information about compositorial stints and the effect they had on the printed pages were outside the scope of a bibliographical description. The report in a description should, at a minimum, contain four elements (not necessarily arranged in this order): an indication of what work has been done to ascertain how many compositors set the book and which pages each one set; an assessment of the reliability of this work; a summary of the conclusions thus far reached; and a brief listing of the evidence employed. Such a report could consist of a single sentence (perhaps following the coverage of identifiable types in a “Typesetting” paragraph), as in this hypothetical example: J—— D—— in 1948 ([ citation ]) argued convincingly that this edition was set by two compositors: one (characterized primarily by the spellings do, go, and here and the speech heading Hen ) set A1 r -B3 v , D2 v -G4 r , L1 r ; the other (characterized primarily by doe, goe, and heere and the heading Henry ) set B4 r -D2 r , G4 v -K4 v . Obviously many variations on this pattern are possible, as circumstances and stylistic considerations dictate; but this sample shows that the bib- liographer's assessment of previous work can sometimes be conveyed by an adverb (“convincingly” in this instance) and that the evidence recorded can be limited to the strongest pieces (as indicated here by “primarily”). Any reader who wishes to have more information about where the cited spellings occur and how many of each there are, as well as what other evidence was considered, can refer to the original study (which will have more details, even if it, too, is a selective presentation). 20 In some situations one would have to report disagreements between previous investigators and try to adjudicate the debate, perhaps by an entirely new investigation that turns up additional relevant evidence. In the latter case, the bibliographer may wish to publish the detailed argument as an independent article, simply referring to its conclusions—as one refers to articles by others—in the bibliographical description. II. Presswork The eight kinds of presswork evidence commented on here are not equally available in books of all periods. For example, variants resulting from stop-press alterations (rather than cancel leaves) are more likely in books before 1700, 21 whereas press figures are largely confined to the eighteenth century and a few decades on each side of it, and plating is, for all practical purposes, a process of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One of the few kinds of evidence regularly found in books of all times is that resulting from typographical accidents; and evidence of first- and second-side impressions and of variations in furniture width can occur in books of any period. The comments below on those matters are therefore applicable to machine-printed books as well as earlier ones. There has not yet been much analytical work on books of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the printing technology of those centuries makes the discovery of useful evidence particularly challenging. Some research, however, has been done on methods for detecting unmarked impressions, recognizing the use of plates, and identifying imposition layouts of machine-printed books, 22 and further work will undoubtedly produce more approaches to books of the past two centuries. The earliest printed books—those from before the early or middle 1470s—also form a class not fully amenable to some of the analytical routines worked out for hand-printed books of the following three centuries: since those early books were customarily printed one page at a time rather than from imposed formes, any of the techniques discussed below that assume the use of multiple-page formes do not apply to these books without adjustment. It thus seems safe to say that no single bibliographical description will need to report on all the matters discussed below. An adequate account of any one of them, however, is likely to occupy a distinctive enough niche in a description that setting it up as a separate paragraph will perhaps in most instances seem the best course. For the sake of logic, when more than one are dealt with, such paragraphs could be linked as subdivisions in a comprehensive section headed “Presswork.” The following pages take up (in this order) evidence of (a) headlines; (b) point-holes; (c) first- and second-forme impressions; (d) typographical variations; (e) impressions from materials not meant to print; (f) press figures; (g) variations in furniture width; and (h) plating. (a) Headlines Many books contain headlines—made up of such elements as running-titles, rules, chapter numbers, and the like—at the head of the text-block on each page; and when the bulk of their content remains the same from page to page, printers sensibly held them in standing type for reuse. A set of such headlines for a single forme (two for folio, four for quarto, and so on) and any other material to be repeated on each page (like box-rules), all ready for new type-pages to be combined with them, is called by bibliographers a “skeleton-forme.” (Printing historians use the term to refer to all the reusable elements in a forme, including the “furniture” surrounding the type-pages; but since there is no way of proving the reuse of material that leaves no impression, analytical bibliographers limit their discussion of skeleton-formes to the elements that print.) The pattern of skeleton-forme use is a basic fact about the printing of a book. If, for instance, the same set of headlines recurs in a number of consecutive formes (and if no other set is repeated), the book was printed with one skeleton; but if two different sets recur (as when one set is used for inner formes and another for outer), two-skeleton printing was employed. It is not difficult, in many pre-1700 books and some later ones, to recognize a particular setting of a running-title when it reappears, for each one may have identifying characteristics such as broken types, distinctive spacings (not only within the title but also between its ends and the left and right type-page margins), or type-styles and spellings that do not reappear in other running titles. 23 Any recurrences of headlines (even single ones, rather than sets, in no discernible pattern) and any reuse of portions of them (as when the letterpress, or part of it, reappears independently of the surrounding rules) constitute facts of the printing history of particular books and are worth noting as evidence of the imposition process. But often headlines do recur in sets corresponding to formes, and bibliographers can then state with confidence how many skeleton- formes were used and where they reappeared. The recurrence of headlines can sometimes be employed by bibliographers to establish the method of half-sheet imposition used to produce certain half-sheet gatherings: when, for instance, the same headline appears on two pages of a half-sheet gathering, the type-pages could not have been imposed for “work-and-turn” (where all the type-pages are on the press at the same time) but instead must have been imposed with other material to make up two full formes for ordinary printing. 24 Whether other details of printing-shop procedure can confidently be inferred from skeleton-forme analysis is less clear. Such analysis was a prominent feature of the post-World War II analytical activity, having been embarked on by Bowers and Hinman even before the war, at the beginnings of their bibliographical careers. A great deal of effort has been expended on attempting to extrapolate, from the pattern of skeleton use, the way in which proofreading was undertaken and the number of copies that were printed; but such analyses are now recognized as flawed because they postulate printing efficiency without taking into account other jobs simultaneously in progress in a shop and also because they make unjustifiable assumptions about the regularity and predictability of compositors' and pressmen's work-rates. 25 More cautious analysis may in the future be able to extract more reliable information from skeleton-forme patterns; but in the meantime the discovery of the recurrences of individual headlines (or portions of them) and whole skeletons is a significant contribution to understanding the production history of any book. And since these facts can often be established with certainty and relatively little effort (at least in books of the earlier hand-press period) and can be reported concisely, they ought to be regularly included in bibliographical descriptions. Indeed, Bowers's experience with running-titles caused him to say in the Principles that “with some books the precise information about the running-titles can constitute bibliographically the most important part of the description” (p. 188). 26 There are obviously two stages involved in the fullest kind of reporting of headline evidence: first, describing the idiosyncrasies that make particular headlines recognizable; second, listing the recurrences of these headlines (or parts of them), once they are identified. In many instances the first of these can reasonably be omitted, on the grounds that the identification of individual headlines is often unquestionable (even if the differences are not always easy to detect without magnification or a collating machine) and that what is of primary interest for presswork analysis is the pattern of headline recurrence, not the peculiarities of the headlines themselves. On the other hand, those peculiarities are physical features that one might expect a bibliographical description to note, and there is always the possibility that, if the basis for discrimination among headlines is made known, other persons may find certain identifications unconvincing. This kind of evidence is more cumbersome to report (but not necessarily more space-consuming) than are the conclusions about recurrences, and each bibliographer must weigh the potential usefulness of the full report in a given situation against the labor and space involved. But regardless of whether the evidence for identifying headlines is stated, bibliographers should make the effort to identify them and should report any recurrences that are located. A convention of sorts—using roman numerals to stand for identifiable headlines—grew up among the headline-analysts of the decades after World War II; but Blayney, in his 1982 book, calls this “a custom which should be abandoned as soon as possible” because such numerals are not only awkward but also undesirable (given their structure) for dealing with arrangements of units (p. 540), and he proceeds to suggest and demonstrate a clearly preferable system. His compact and usable style of report employs lower-case letters to stand for individual headlines, and they are listed for each forme in a standard order. In the example below for a quarto (adapted from p. 541), the order moves from 1 r (for outer formes) or 2 r (for inner formes) counterclockwise around the printed forme (clockwise around the forme of type): 27 E(o) a b c d b, d, f, h: E(i) e f g h The L. Cokes charge, F(o) e 2* f g h a, c, e, g: F(i) a b c 2 d giuen at Norwich Aſſiſes. G(o) a b c 3* d G(i) e 2 f g h H(o) a b c 4 - H(i) e 2 d g h This plan makes it easy to see whatever patterns there are, whether the recurrences are of whole skeletons or only of individual (if sometimes variant) headlines. The order of the letters could be explained in words, as above (and as Blayney does), or by providing the following guide at the beginning of the table: $(o) 1 r 2 v 3 r 4 v $(i) 2 r 1 v 4 r 3 v One could also place the outer and inner formes of each sheet on the same horizontal line, as follows: (o) 1 r 2 v 3 r 4 v (i) 2 r 1 v 4 r 3 v E a b c d e f g h F e 2* f g h a b c 2 d G a b c 3* d e 2 f g h H a b c 4 - e 2 d g h It is true that the price paid for this compression is that the pattern is not quite as immediately discernible; in instances of this kind, where skeletons remain relatively intact but sometimes shift from inner to outer formes (or vice versa), one might wish to retain Blayney's layout. But in cases where the patterns are not as neat, less is gained by the more spacious plan. In an article two years later, Blayney altered the arrangement somewhat to report the following situation: 28 B(o) - a b c D(o) h i j k G(o) l m n o B(i) d e f g D(i) f a b c G(i) p q r s C(o) f a b c F(o) l m n o H(o) l m n o C(i) f a b c F(i) p q r s H(i) p q r s One could argue that the following presentation might be at least as useful, and perhaps more so: (o) 1 r 2 v 3 r 4 v (i) 2 r 1 v 4 r 3 v B - a b c d e f g C f a b c f a b c D h i j k f a b c F l m n o p q r s G l m n o p q r s H l m n o p q r s For formats with more pages per forme, it is particularly desirable to have along the top a readily accessible reminder of the order in which the headlines are listed; and for long books (whatever the format), if there are recurrences that are not easily noticeable, some discursive commentary on the tabular record would be in order. In any case, it seems clear that some version of Blayney's basic system deserves to become standard. 29 In cases where running-titles on rectos are different from those on versos, the number of places where a given headline could be reused is of course reduced; and Blayney, as a way of informing the reader of the wording of running-titles, transcribes a sample (identified by an underlined letter) of a recto and verso title (as shown above). 30 Descriptive bibliographers often include this information (with details about the type face) in the paragraph on typography, and thus in a full-scale description following this practice there would be no need to repeat it here. What one might decide to do (as Blayney does not) is to present another list recording the evidence that was employed in identifying the headlines: either before or after the kind of table described above, one could simply run the letters (identifying headlines) down the left margin and for each one print a photographic reproduction of one of the occurrences of that headline. An alternative would obviously be to describe in words the identifying features of each headline—and, indeed, such a description might be helpful in any case, since those features might not be readily noticeable. A list of this kind may not always seem worthwhile; but there is no doubt about the importance of including a table like the ones illustrated above whenever headline recurrences have been located. (b) Point-holes The tympan of the hand-press (at least after the early years) 31 was furnished with adjustable pointed pins that could be fastened into position along the two longer sides of the tympan; when the paper to be printed was placed on the tympan, it was pressed over the points of these pins, which thus pierced the paper. These “points” served three purposes: they held the paper in place; they helped to assure proper register of the perfecting forme if the same holes were slipped over the points when the paper was turned over; and, through their particular placement, they made it impossible to turn the paper over the wrong way—if, again, the same holes in the paper were reused. 32 Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), in its section of imposition diagrams (pp. 88-105), shows the location of points in relation to the printed sheets in various formats and thus where one should expect to find point-holes in books of differing formats. Point-holes are of course frequently not visible in bound books, for in folio they fall in or near the fold, where a tight binding can make them inaccessible, and in quarto and octavo they come in the upper and outer margins, respectively, and are frequently lost in trimming. But they are often enough available (in untrimmed copies or unbound sets of sheets) that they have been a subject of discussion regarding their use in bibliographical analysis. David Foxon once suggested, for example, that the distance between point-holes might distinguish the work of different presses; but Kenneth Povey and K. I. D. Maslen found contrary evidence in which point-hole distances did not correlate with press figures. 33 Indeed, given the fact that the points were adjustable and that formes from duodecimo jobs might be interspersed between formes from jobs of other formats on any given press, it is an open question whether consistency is to be expected. Nevertheless, when point- holes are visible, they at least tell one how the points were set for that particular sheet (or some copies of it), if not necessarily for the whole book; examining their positions relative to the sheet can sometimes help to distinguish different impressions, and noting the leaves on which they appear can reveal the particular imposition used (what kind of half-sheet imposition in duodecimo, for example, or which of the alternative whole-sheet impositions in octavo and duodecimo). Their positions should therefore be recorded in a bibliographical description—in turn adding to the store of recorded instances of observable point-holes. Vander Meulen, in his Dunciad bibliography, reports the locations of point-holes in relation to the leaf (viewed from the recto side), using a spatial arrangement of the distances from the hole (designated “x”) to each of the four sides of the leaf (with the figures in millimeters and “%” signifying a deckle edge), as in this example for a quarto (adapted from p. 251): B1,2 o C1,2 o D1,2 o 126 × 120% 136? × 107% 136 × 110% 301% 296% 294% B3,4 o C3,4 o D3,4 o 163 × 80% 123 × 123% 152 × 89% 301% 296% 300% This system is admirably clear but requires a great deal of space (several times in Vander Meulen's bibliography the point-hole record occupies a whole page or more), and in some cases one might wish to use a more concise form that conveys the essential information. One could, for instance, run the figures on in linear fashion, always giving the measurement from the hole to the top of the leaf first, followed by the other measurements in clockwise order: B1,2: o|120%|301%|126. B3,4: o|80%|301%|163. [ and so on ] But since the edge of the leaf at which these holes occur is known for a given format, and since a bibliographical description records elsewhere the format and the leaf dimensions, one could argue that as a general rule only one set of measurements need be given (along the edge where the hole appears), even though such a system would ignore the fact that the holes do not always occur exactly at the edges of the leaves as folded 34 and that not all leaves have precisely the same dimensions. This approach would turn the example above into some such form as the following: Point-holes appear along the top edge of the leaf, spaced horizontally as follows: B1,2: 126|120%; B3,4: 163|80%; [ and so on ] One may well ask whether the second measurement in each pair (or, in general terms, any measurement to an outer edge) is useful if the copy has been trimmed, since such a measurement would probably vary in different copies even if the position of the hole on the full sheet was in fact the same (and if the measurement does not vary, that fact would not necessarily mean that the hole was in the same position). Even so, measuring the distance from the hole to the cut edge(s) in every copy examined is useful, so that the largest measurement can be used as a minimum figure for the distance to the original edge(s). One might also record the distance between the point-holes on each sheet (if both holes are visible), by adding together the intervening distances on the relevant leaves. These figures by themselves would not help readers visualize where the points can be found and might even be misleading, since identical distances would not necessarily mean iden- tical placement of points in relation to the two edges; but the measurement could be helpful for some analytical purposes and could be a useful supplement to the hole-to-edge figures, especially in instances of cut edges. The two approaches could be combined in the following way, for example: Distances between point-holes vary, and the holes appear at the top edge of the leaf, as follows: B 289 mm apart (B1,2: 126|120%; B3,4: 163|80%) C 259? mm apart (C1,2: 136?|107%; C3,4: 123|123%) D 288 mm apart (D1,2: 136|110%; D3,4: 152|89%) If the distances between the point-holes do not vary, then one could of course make a much more compressed report, as in this hypothetical example: Point-holes 290 mm apart ($1,2: 135|115; $3,4: 155|95), except in D, G, and R, where they are not present in the examined copies. Recognizing the difficulties inherent in orienting point-holes to leafedges, one would be well advised (as Vander Meulen has suggested to me)—especially in formats where the measurements would be to two cut edges, top and bottom—to state the position of the holes in relation to the type-page, for that relationship should be constant even if successive sheets had been laid on the tympan in slightly different positions. One possible notation for this purpose would be to substitute for the vertical line a bracketed indication of line number (for vertical measurements) or underlined position within the top line (for horizontal measurements): 192 [line 33] 28 126 [w e re] 120 Alternatively, one could place between the brackets a measurement from the top margin of the type-page (for vertical measurements) or left margin (for horizontal measurements); such a measurement would be somewhat more precise but would be less convenient for the user—since a great advantage of the former style is that it enables one to detect variation without measurement. Of course, when a hole is too near the corner of the leaf to be keyed to a line or word in the text, one would have to use a measurement from some point in the type-page in any case. An explanation of the whole system, whatever form it takes, would appear in the preface or introduction to the bibliography, and one could at that point explain the “%” (or whatever symbol one chooses) 35 and the fact that horizontal leaf measurements are taken from the recto side (though if all relevant leaves have deckle edges, the latter point would be obvious from the appearance of the deckle symbol with the second of the two figures every time). Explaining the system fully in every affected description might seem cumbersome, but some minimal introductory explanation, as in these examples, should probably be used each time as an aid to the reader. (c) First- and second-forme impressions When sheets are printed from relief surfaces—that is, from metal types or relief plates, rather than by planographic methods such as photographic offset—it is frequently possible to tell which side was printed first and which second, for the side printed first may display an embossed effect resulting from the indentations produced by the perfecting forme. (The indentations made by the first forme, causing an embossed effect on the unprinted side of the sheet, are of course largely flattened by the perfecting forme, which thus leaves the primary embossed effect on the first-forme side.) When sheets were pressed between hot metal plates before folding (as Baskerville did), this evidence for the order of the formes was destroyed; but in other cases one can often uncover it by holding the paper in a parallel beam of light, which causes the embossed hillocks to cast shadows. The eye, however, often needs assistance in making the required discrimination; sometimes a magnifying glass is sufficient, but at other times one needs to use a special lamp of the kind described by Kenneth Povey in 1960. 36 Since the perfecting forme does not flatten every hillock produced by the first forme, and since one therefore can sometimes have difficulty judging which side of the sheet is rougher, an additional helpful technique is to search for hillocks that have ink on them, for these can only be on the side printed first. It is worth the bibliographer's time to determine, when possible, the first- and second-forme impressions of each sheet 37 of the books being described because the order of formes is obviously one of the fundamental facts about the presswork for a book—and is thus valuable information in its own right, aside from whatever analytical uses it can support (such as the detection of cancels in instances where the paper evidence is not conclusive). The bibliographer must remember, however, that (as with other evidence) multiple copies have to be examined before conclusions can be drawn. If one copy of a book shows the first-forme impression of a given sheet in the inner forme, and another copy shows it in the outer forme, one may be able to conclude (despite Gaskell's doubts in A New Introduction to Bibliography, p. 132) that concurrent printing on two presses had been employed (each press printing some of the white paper with different formes and then exchanging the half-printed sheets for perfecting), although other explanations are possible (such as an interruption in the printing of a sheet, or the reprinting of a sheet). When one is dealing with a half-sheet gathering, variations between copies as to which side of the half-sheet shows second-forme indentations probably signify that the printing was done by the “work-and-turn” method (in which the same forme is used for both sides of the full sheet, producing two copies of the same half-sheet text). 38 Establishing such facts as these, even if the first-forme evidence is not used in any other way, supplies important details of printing history (relating not only to the books involved but also to the practices of the shops where they were printed). Vander Meulen (in his Dunciad bibliography) records first-forme information as follows (this example adapted from p. 324, with “ I ” standing for inner formes and “ O ” for outer): First forme] I: B-D; O: E; Mixed: F The only addition one might wish to make to this sensible plan is a provision for indicating which copies show each pattern in the “mixed” category, as in this hypothetical example: 39 Inner: A-C, F-G, K. Outer: D, H, J. Mixed: E (inner, copies 2-5, 8, 11; outer, 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12). Or, for books with multi-sheet gatherings, 40 one could append to each relevant signature (that is, the signatures for any multi-sheet gatherings in which all the sheets do not exhibit the same first- and second-forme pattern) either (1) the leaf numbers (joined with a period to show conjugacy) or (2) a bracketed figure identifying the sheet (numbering from the outermost sheet to the innermost—as in the following examples for a folio in sixes (where three sheets are quired together): Inner: A1.6, A3.4, B, D2.5. Outer: A2.5, C2.5, C3.4, D1.6, D3.4. Mixed: C1.6 (inner, copies 3, 4, 7; outer, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8). Inner: (A[1,3], B, D[2]. Outer: A[2], C[2,3], D[1,3]. Mixed: C[1] (inner, copies 3, 4, 7; outer, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8). One might sometimes prefer to have a record arranged in sheet order, which in some instances might facilitate studying the sequential progress of the sheets through the press (if indeed the sheets were printed in signature order): A(i), B(i), C(i), D(o), E(i,o) [2-5, 8, 11; 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12], F(i), G(i), H(o), J(o), K(i). A1.6(i), A2.5(o), A3.4(i), B(i), C1.6(i/o) [3, 4, 7; 1, 2, 5, 6, 8], C2.5(o), C3.4(o), D1.6(o), D2.5(i), D3.4(o). Povey in fact used this approach and combined with it an indication of which forme was printed on the felt (rather than the mould) side of the paper: 41 B C D E F G H I K L M N O First forme o o i o i i i i o o i o o Felt i i i i i i o o i i o o o One could of course rearrange this information in the style suggested above, subordinating the felt/mould record to that of first formes, by appending “felt” and “mould” to “Inner” and “Outer,” or “f” and “m” to “i” and “o”: Inner felt: D, F, G. Inner mould: H, I, M. Outer felt: N, O. Outer mould: B, C, E, K, L. B(om), C(om), D(if), E(om), F(if), G(if), H(im), I(im), K(om), L(om), M(im), N(of), O(of). These unlabeled examples of course assume some such heading as “First-forme impressions,” since that is what is being listed. One might question the logic of emphasizing (or seeming to emphasize) first-forme over second-forme impressions, when the primary point is simply the order of the formes, whatever it is. But a heading like “Order of formes of each sheet” would result in a less efficient listing (since specifying first— or second—formes conveys by inference, but unambiguously, the information about the unnamed formes); and thus, in practical terms, making first formes the focus of the record seems acceptable. (d) Typographical variations Variations—in what is printed at a given place—among copies of the same impression (printing), or between impressions of the same edition, fall into two obvious categories: those following from deliberate alteration of the printing surface and those caused by the action of the press or the process of handling and inking the type or plates. The former may result from attempted textual correction or revision (and concomitant unintended changes) or from the effort to rectify some flaw in the visual appearance of the type images or their placement; when such variations occur within an impression, they are generally called stop-press alterations or, more simply if less descriptively, press variants. The other category—variations produced by the action of the press, by the inking process, or by handling between impressions—includes progressive damage to types, ornaments, woodcuts, or plates and shifting positions (or even loss) of types. (Study of the progressive damage to ornaments, ornamental initials, and woodcuts—as opposed to the damage to basic letterform-types—is one of the oldest techniques of bibliographical analysis and has long been used as evidence for dating or timing; a good recent example is Blayney's section on “Ornament Damage” in his Texts of KING LEAR, pp. 486-491.) Any attempt to report such details obviously requires full collations of the texts of multiple copies of each impression involved. Even with the aid of a Hinman, Lindstrand, or McLeod collator (one of which should certainly be used), this task is time-consuming, and many descriptive bibliographers have felt that it was not part of their responsibility to collate the texts of the books they describe, leaving this job to editors, who have no choice but to do so. Such bibliographers have thus placed themselves in the odd position of believing that the pages making up the bulk of a book demand less of their attention than the pages that come before and after the main text. 42 This attitude is manifested in extreme form in those “bibliographies” that give quasi-facsimile transcriptions of title pages and not much else, as if the title page is somehow the most important page of a book. There is no question that title pages and other preliminaries, as well as such concluding pages as integral advertisements, can offer important clues to the differentiation of impressions and issues; but so can details discovered on the text pages, details that can be systematically searched for only by close scrutiny of every page. Variations found in this way are conceptually no different from those found on preliminary or concluding pages, and they are potentially more significant. Whether they reflect the course of presswork on a single impression or result from events between impressions, they are equally part of what a physical description ought to report. The former indicate states of pages, and the latter are sometimes the only features distinguishing separate impressions from each other. Even those bibliographers (largely of the past) who conceived author bibliographies to be simply guides to the identification of first printings recognized the importance of including such information; and certainly any bibliographer who understands that to be truly descriptive a bibliography must account for the entire book ought to see, as a corollary, that details found through a careful examination of the text belong in a description, whether or not they are the sole means for identifying impressions. The reluctance that bibliographers have felt toward textual collation does not stem merely from the amount of work involved, though that is often an element (for descriptive bibliography is demanding enough without this additional burden). A more fundamental reason that has allowed bibliographers to feel justified in regarding textual collation as dispensable, irrespective of the labor, is that texts are not thought of as part of the physical makeup of books. Yet they are physical, of course, consisting of inked letterforms and punctuation marks on paper or parchment. Verbal works, it is true, are intangible, 43 but texts of those works, when placed on material surfaces, become physical entities. Presumably an interest in an author's works, along with a recognition that the texts claiming to represent those works are affected by the process of their material presentation, underlies bibliographers' decisions to embark on descriptive bibliographies in the first place. But then, having made that decision, many bibliographers proceed as if physical descriptions and textual considerations were wholly separate matters. Moreover, to compound the incoherence, they sometimes report “points”—textual or type-damage variations that are offered as identifying features to be checked by collectors, cataloguers, and others making use of the books—on a seemingly random basis, without the benefit of full collations to determine whether these are the only points, or even the only ones required for distinguishing impressions of books, or states of pages. They are thus admitting the relevance of textual variants while rejecting the necessity of a systematic search for them. Some of the “points” that have been cited, particularly in unsophisticated authorbibliographies of the years between the world wars, either are typographical errors that happen to have been noticed (and that in fact appear to remain constant in all copies) or are randomly chosen instances of variation that are misleading when used in isolation. (As an example of how they can be misleading, a single variant may be noted as the distinguishing mark of a second impression, when in fact there may be other variants in other gatherings, and different copies may show different combinations of these variants.) By the late 1920s, complaints about the abuses of “point”-evidence began to be heard, and the criticisms have continued, off and on, to the present. 44 Although the abuses were real, the attacks have sometimes had the undesirable effect of causing wholesale contempt for “points.” But typographical variations, when they exist, are important features to be aware of and must be called attention to; the problem is not in the “points” themselves but in the methodology sometimes employed for locating them and assessing their significance. And a defensible methodology must begin with thorough textual collations between copies of the same edition. How extensively the results of textual collations need to be reported in descriptive bibliographies is a complicated question. In the abstract, there is no way to rule out anything discovered in either intra- or inter-edition collations as irrelevant to the aim of accounting for the physical objects that have attempted to transmit a given work. As a practical matter, however, there may in some cases be responsible ways of condensing material that would otherwise be unwieldy (and if it would not be unwieldy, there is no point abridging it). The basis for abridgment could well be the question of what is necessary for identification, even though that question does not determine the coverage of a descriptive bibliography; in other words, the matter of identification could dictate the degrees of detail with which various bodies of evidence are reported but would not cause any of them to be totally eliminated. For example, textual variants (that is, variations in wording, spelling, and punctuation) between editions (separate typesettings) are unlikely to be the sole means of distinguishing those editions because resettings of type can hardly be so exact in every respect that they do not leave other, and more easily detectable, signs of their difference. If the textual variants are numerous, and especially if they have been (or are likely soon to be) reported in a scholarly edition, these variants could be handled in a descriptive bibliography by a general statement characterizing them, giving some examples, and citing any fuller account (such as the apparatus of an edition). Most major authors have been (or are likely to be) accorded scholarly editions, and descriptive bibliographies of these authors need not include full lists of variants between editions. 45 But when textual variants are relatively small in number or when they have not been (and are perhaps not likely to be) recorded elsewhere, they should be reported more thoroughly, preferably in their entirety. 46 What descriptive bibliographers should remember, however they finally decide to handle inter-edition textual variants, is that these variants are part of the story that a descriptive bibliography sets out to tell. Textual variants and other typographical variations between copies of the same edition (intra-edition variants) sometimes vary between separate impressions and sometimes vary among copies of a single impression. In the first case (which rarely occurs in books of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, when editions usually consisted of single impressions), the variations—resulting from textual alterations made between printings, 47 or type and plate damage that occurred in the handling and storage between printings—may or may not be the sole means for identifying the impressions. But in any event a full list of the variations is desirable in order to define thoroughly what each printing consists of. Furthermore, the possibility always exists that copies were made up of sheets from different printings, and an abridged list of variations may not allow one to determine whether a given copy consists of sheets from the same printing throughout. When a full list of such variations has been published in a scholarly edition or elsewhere, the descriptive bibliographer may wish to argue that an abridged list is defensible. But, at a minimum, it ought to include all textual variants and at least one variation (of whatever kind) for every sheet containing variations. And once this much is recorded, there would seem to be little point of inconveniencing readers by referring them elsewhere for the remaining items. Variations between printings of an edition (which in any case are not likely to be as numerous as variations between editions) should therefore normally be listed in full. Such lists of typographical differences are likely to be one of the main features of entries for second and later printings (along with any title-page and binding differences). They could take some such form as the following, which gives at the left the readings of the first of the printings being compared (keyed here to page and line, though signature notation could be added), followed by those of the next printing, the one being described: 48 16.12 nations] matrons 78.19 home;] semicolon missing through plate damage along right edge 117.8 whenever] wherever 207.21-23 many / efforts / not] the an, ff, and ot obliterated If the list were long, one might separate it into two sections, the first recording intentional textual alterations and the second the results of type and plate damage or other accidents. The other kind of intra-edition variants, those among copies of single impressions, also sometimes requires full listing in a bibliographical description for a similar reason—to allow for the detection of different states of individual pages. Changes that occur to particular formes during the course of a single printing create states of the pages printed from those formes. Because a sheet printed from the first state of its inner forme and the second (or third, or fourth) state of its outer forme may be combined in a given copy with another sheet consisting of the first state of both its formes and with other sheets displaying various other combinations, one cannot apply the term “state” to entire copies of books but only to the affected parts. 49 As a result, there cannot be separate entries for states in a descriptive bibliography; states must instead be taken up within the entries for individual impressions, and some account of the variations involved is an essential element in a description of an impression, for without it an important physical characteristic of the impression as a whole would not be accounted for. In books from the first two and a half centuries of printing, the most common form of intra-impression variation results from stop-press textual alterations. In later books, from a time when textual changes were more likely to be made by cancel leaves and gatherings or between printings, the intra-printing variations are apt to be those caused by progressive type or plate damage, variations in inking, and shifting type during the course of printing. Stop-press alterations, which create textual variation through the deliberate in- sertion, deletion, or other adjustment of pieces of type (and sometimes through inadvertent type-changes that are by-products of the process), should be listed in full; but the instances of variation that result from the action of the press may usually be reported in the form of selected examples, with some comment generalizing about the extent of such variation. The actual manner in which all these kinds of typographical variation should be recorded cannot be prescribed in advance for every situation, but in general it can be said that a formulaic listing is probably the clearest and most easily usable form—always supplemented, as necessary, by discursive prose. Stop-press textual alterations are regularly listed in scholarly editions in a form similar to that used for other categories of textual evidence. 50 And though this form of course differs somewhat from edition to edition, a plan that was made prominent by virtue of its use in Fredson Bowers's editions of Dekker (1953-61), Beaumont and Fletcher (1966-96), and Marlowe (1973) is the following (condensed from the first volume of the Dekker, p. 94): Page 037, SB52 This form establishes the kinds of information that any such listing should contain: arrangement by forme, identification of the order of the variants (if possible), and specification of which copies contain each reading. Since Bowers's listing was designed for an edition, it is understand- able that he placed the “corrected” reading—the one in his text—first; but in a descriptive bibliography, the readings should be placed in chronological order, as Bowers in fact does in the bibliographical descriptions appended to his Fielding edition (1967-). 51 (Although chronological order generally means listing uncorrected readings before corrected ones, it is important to remember that attempts to correct the text do not necessarily result in actual corrections, and the bibliographer should probably call attention to instances of this sort; furthermore, the sequence of the variants is not always clear, and the order of the listing can then be only arbitrary.) In addition to rearranging Bowers's entries in this way, one could make the record much more concise, with no loss of clarity, by using numbers to stand for each copy and placing all the information relevant to each entry on a single line: 52 C(i) 2 r : I.iii.13 be] 1; be: 2-5 4 r : I.iv.98 how] 1; hoe, 2-5 4 r : I.iv.111 readie,] 1; readie? 2-5 4 r : II.i.1 farre] 1; far, 2-5 E(i) 4 r : III.ii.56 how,] 1; how now, 2-5 In this sample I have retained the act-scene-line numbers because doing so would enable readers to use the list in conjunction with editions other than the one being described; but normally in a descriptive bibliography one would give only the page-line numbers of the book under examination (whereas in an edition it is always helpful to provide a reference to the newly edited text as well). Often there is evidence of more than one stage of stop-press alteration, as when some copies show one correction in a given forme, and other copies have another correction in addition to that one. The above plan could be adapted to accommodate this situation by arranging the lines in the order of correction-stages and placing a superscript figure after the forme designation—as in “C(i)2”. As for the recording of variations produced by the action of the press or the handling and inking of the formes, there is less precedent to follow, but the same general plan can generally be employed. Shifting types, for example, could be recorded as follows, using empty brackets to signify spaces between types. 53 B(i)5 v : 26.5 handing] copies 2, 6, 7; han[]ding 3, 5, 9; hand[]ing 1, 4, 8 G(o)4 v : 104.8 bookstore] 2, 7, 9; book[]store 1, 3, 6; boo[]kstore 4, 5, 8 The amount of space represented by the empty brackets may vary among the copies cited; it is not the purpose of the listing to record every slight movement of type that has been noted but only to call attention to the fact that shifting does occur at certain places on the text pages. Progressive damage to the letterforms is more difficult to represent. Xerographic or photographic reproductions of the damage in particular copies could of course be incorporated into the listings, but the value of such precision is seldom enough to justify the trouble involved (in contrast to the precision required for identifying types in the study of typesetting). Noting the presence of progressive damage in the following manner is probably adequate: C(i)2 r : 35.10 descriptive] 3, 8-11, 13; the p shows progressive damage from each of the following groups to the next: 2, 12; 5; 1, 4, 6, 7 E(o)8 v : 80.17 bond] 4, 7, 10, 12, 13; the o is damaged so as to appear an e in copies 1-3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 K(i)6 r : 155.3-17 no damage at right edge ] 1, 3- 6, 8, 13; plate damage along right edge, causing comma at end of line 14 to vanish, in 2, 7, 9-12 For entries of all these sorts, such a style is primarily useful when more than two or three examples are given; otherwise they can simply be presented in ordinary sentence form. Not every copy examined need be cited in such entries, and nothing need be implied about the readings in any copies not cited (though of course one can, if one has the information about every examined copy, use an inclusive system, such as saying that all copies not cited conform to the reading given at the left, in instances where such a procedure would save enough space to make it worthwhile). The other way in which these lists can be selective is that they need not record every spot at which shifting type, inconsistent quad impressions, and progressive type or plate damage occur. These occurrences are generally of no significance individually, but collectively they constitute a fact about the printing history of the impression; a selective list accompanied by a generalization about the extent of such occurrences is normally sufficient. But whenever the shifting or damage creates a textual variant—as when a space appearing within a word creates two separate words (see the example labeled 104.8 above) or when a letter or mark of punctuation develops damage that makes it appear to be a different letter or mark (see the example labeled 80.17 above)—the individual instance does have significance because it would cause anyone using a copy containing such an instance to misconstrue the text. All instances of this sort should therefore be included in a listing, or indeed the listing could be limited to them, with the attached commentary noting the extent of other shifting and damage that do not create textual problems. 54 References to type and plate damage, whether it occurred between printings or during the course of the press run for a single printing, serve to remind one of a requirement for the collating of copies from the same edition: the necessity—whether one uses a single control copy for all collations or different pairs of copies in order to multiply more rapidly the number of collated copies—for noting not merely all the places that differ in any way but also some of the anomalous occurrences that are identical, such as instances of type or plate damage, wrong-font letters, odd spacing, and shifting type, which could be spots that vary in other copies. 55 Unless one makes note of these places, even though they are the same in the two copies being collated at any given time, and then checks them in numerous other copies, one may never discover certain variations, for one can easily have the bad luck never to bring together for full collation two copies that differ at particular places. Many of these notes made during collation will probably not find their way into one's published lists, but they are useful both for providing a guide to problem spots to be checked in copies that one is not going to collate com pletely and also for giving one a fuller basis for making generalizations about the presswork for a particular printing. In every case the reader should be told what degree of thoroughness was used in checking copies and what principle of selectivity was followed in reporting the results. 56 (e) Impressions from materials not meant to print Occasionally quads (and other material meant to hold space between types or to keep the type in place) work up to the level of the printing surface and leave blind or inked impressions on the paper. Similarly, bearers (type, wood, or other material used to fill in areas without type in order to keep the platen from tilting when it makes contact with the forme) sometimes leave tell-tale traces on the paper (for two examples, see the fourth and fifth illustrations in Roger E. Stoddard's Marks in Books, 1985). In one sense, such occurrences might be thought of as a subset of the category of typographical mishaps, just discussed. But the difference (aside from the fact that they are not, strictly speaking, typographical) is that they are an aspect of presswork whether or not they vary within an edition. When the unintended typographical events discussed above are identical in all copies of an edition, they are not the result of the presswork process but rather reflect the state of the type when it was composed. But impressions from quads and bearers, even when they remain the same, are often the result of faulty make-ready and locking up of the forme or the action of the press itself. (It is true there is the possibility that some flaw in the setting of the quads was ultimately responsible; but since this possibility is relatively unlikely and cannot in any case be determined, it is best to treat all such instances as aspects of presswork.) There are thus three kinds of situations to report—(1) when all copies of an edition are identical: D(o)3 r : 53.7 inked impression of a quad visible between and and when M(i)4 r : 183.2 row of blind impressions of quads fills out this line (2) when there is variation between printings: D(o)3 r : 53.7 and when] inked impression of a quad appears between these words M(i)4 r : 183.2 no blind impression visible ] row of blind impressions of quads fills out this line and (3) when there is variation among copies of a printing: D(o)3 r : 53.7 and when] copies 9, 13; blind impression of a quad is visible between these words in 2, 5, 8, 11; inked impression of the quad appears in 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12 M(i)4 r : 183.2 no blind impressions visible ] 1, 3-10, 13; a row of blind impressions of quads fills out this line in 2, 11, 12 When types are the objects serving as bearers, they often consist of units of composed types that had been, or were going to be, used for printing elsewhere; thus a whole line or passage of text may be visible in blind impression in areas of a page that were supposed to be blank. In these cases an effort should be made to identify the text whose types were used as bearing material (with the help of raking light if necessary), and the record should indicate where it occurs in inked form (generally on a page not far away, but sometimes in another book that was being produced in the same shop). Having identified the text and noted the relationship (in terms of formes) between the locations of its inked and blind impressions, one may then be able to draw some conclusions about the order of printing of certain formes. Randall McLeod, in his 1999 Rosenbach Lectures, has demonstrated—more fully and clearly than anyone else—what this kind of analysis can accomplish. At times combining this evidence with that from identifiable recurrent types and headlines, as well as from the embossing that reveals the order in which the two formes of a sheet were printed, he shows, for example, that one gathering in the 1528 Aldine edition of Castiglione was printed from the inside out and another from the outside in. He also discovers, in the case of two other Aldines, that a headline in a book dated 1504 was used as a bearer in a book dated 1503, and he then offers an account of the overlapping production of the two, recognizing that still other books were no doubt being worked on at the same time. His approach is clearly complementary to such techniques as those developed by Adrian Weiss for identifying fonts and “fill-in” jobs: all help to build up a picture of the concurrent activity in a shop and thereby to add precision to the production history of individual books. After McLeod's work, bibliographers must carefully scrutinize any “blank” areas on the pages of the books they examine, for those areas may contain blind impressions (less distinct in some copies than in others as a result of repressing during rebinding) that furnish valuable information about the presswork process. 57 (f) Press figures The numbers and other symbols now known as press figures—notations that are clearly not signatures but that are found in the lower margins of some pages in many eighteenth-century British and American books (and were occasionally used in the decades just before and after that century)—have been extensively studied only since the middle of the twentieth century. 58 Before then, the few bibliographers who paid attention to them were primarily interested in the variant figures that sometimes occur in different copies of the same edition. 59 But beginning with two works of 1949—an article by Walter E. Knotts and the important dissertation of William B. Todd—there has been a growing recognition of the value of recording all the press figures in a book under investigation, not just the variant figures that happen to have been located in the copies examined. 60 It was Todd's dissertation, in fact, that caused Bowers to make a last-minute addition to the Principles stating that these figures should be “minutely recorded in a shorthand manner for every forme and sheet of a book in an eighteenth-century bibliography” (p. 321). In the discussions that followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with their scrutiny of a great many figured books, certain puzzling questions were repeatedly addressed and remained unanswered—most notably whether the figures refer to pressmen or presses and how to interpret the absence of figures in some formes of books that contain them in other formes. 61 Despite the fact that the precise printing-house function of figures is not yet entirely understood, it does seem clear that they are a product of the presswork phase and have something to do with accounting for the work done by different press teams. Some of the ways in which bibliographers have used them, such as considering them independently sufficient clues for distinguishing impressions or determining the order of formes through the press, have displayed the same incautious optimism that characterized certain other efforts of bibliographical analysis in the years following World War II. But there is no question that figures can sometimes help to determine imposition, as when two figures show up in a half-sheet (ruling out the work-and-turn system) or when a figure appears on a duodecimo page that in one possible layout would be in the inner rank of pages in the forme (making more likely an alternative layout in which that page could more easily be reached). 62 Whatever use a descriptive bibliographer puts figures to, the fact remains that they are prominent vestiges of the book-production process and that there can be no excuse for failing to record them in descriptive bibliographies. How best to do so, however, has never been agreed on, and several different systems have been tried. Knotts's 1949 article used a table in which horizontal rows represented different copies and vertical columns the signatures; in the appropriate squares page references and figures were entered, in the form “B1 v -1 (inner).” Though clear enough, this system would not be practical for dealing with a large number of books or with large books, for two-thirds of a page is occupied by the table for eight copies of The Beggar's Opera, a book with only six gatherings. Philip Gaskell, the following year, 63 set up charts with figures along the left and signatures across the top; whenever a particular figure appeared on a given sheet, the fact was indicated by a diagonal line in the appropriate square (or crossing lines when the same figure occurred in both formes). Again, this notation is not economical of space, since each chart serves only for a single copy; in addition, there is no indication of the page (or the forme) figured—essential information for a study of pressmen's habits or shop policy—although of course a page reference could be substituted for the diagonal line. At about the same time, Todd began his important series of articles following from his dissertation 64 and recommended a simple and concise notation that has been frequently used by others since. It is similar to Knotts's in consisting of page-dash-figure, but it does not involve a chart, only a list run on in paragraph form. Todd has used both page numbers (“18-6”) and signature references (“D2 v -2”); though the second form takes slightly more space, it conveys much more information conveniently (sheet and forme), and either method makes it possible to list all the figures in a book, with their precise locations, in the space of a compact paragraph (or in one column of a composite chart). 65 This condensation, however, is achieved by the sacrifice of convenience in extracting certain other pieces of information: thus it is difficult to tell, without resorting to a tally of one's own, just how many figures appear in a given book, whether or not particular pressmen had preferred pages for figuring, and what kind of division of labor the figures suggest. The method is not readily adaptable to recording variant figures, and Todd later used a table in which each horizontal line represents the agreement of specified copies on the figures in a given sheet (both inner and outer formes), so that variant copies require additional lines. 66 Still other methods have been tried. Kenneth Povey in his extensive 1959 survey, “A Century of Press Figures” (see note 33 above), examined 111 figured books and recorded the figures for individual books by placing the page references (in terms of signatures) in horizontal rows with the corresponding press figures immediately below; separate pairs of lines were used for outer and inner formes. This system provides for a great deal of information but is somewhat cumbersome and space-consuming. Povey supplemented it in one instance by an extremely convenient summary table showing how many times each figure had appeared in each possible location (p. 255), an invaluable aid when the intention, like Povey's, is to demonstrate something about the nature of press figures and not simply to identify different printings. Two years later Allan Stevenson, in his comprehensive introduction to the second volume (1961) of the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt, included a thoughtful discussion of the whole problem of recording press figures (pp. clxiv-clxvi) and recommended grouping forme or page references according to figure, as “1:iA iB oC,” or “1:A7 v B1 v C8 v .” He recognized that such additional space as is required by the second style may be well worth while for the additional information about figuring practice that can be derived from it. Philip Gaskell, in his Soho bibliography of the Foulis Press (1964), used the same system but condensed it by specifying that all leaf numbers referred to versos unless rectos were indicated: “`1' on Vol. 1 A2 B1... D1 F1 G1 I1 L1 N6.” It can be seen, from this sampling, that the two basic approaches have been (1) a sequential list of signatures, formes, or pages with the corresponding figures indicated for each, and (2) a list arranged by figures, with the signatures, formes, or pages on which each figure appears grouped by figure. The first lends itself more readily to a study of the process of printing, the second to an examination of the division of labor and of individual figuring habits. Both are relevant to any bibliography conceived of as a record and not simply a guide to identification (which would in any case require some kind of full listing to aid in the detection of variant figures). Furthermore, the greater the body of data that is accumulated about press figures, the more reliable will be hypotheses about their nature; and it should be part of the descriptive bibliographer's duty to help build up the body of printing-practice data by recording figures as fully as possible when they are encountered. Only if the statistics are clearly presented by each person who has occasion to deal with a figured book—and conveniently arranged for extracting several kinds of information—can the practical difficulties of assimilating complicated data about thousands of books be eventually overcome. For these reasons, I suggested in 1966 a system that involves two kinds of table: one, which could be called a “sequence table,” listing figures (and their locations) in the order of their appearance in the book; the other, a “summary table,” bringing together such information as the number of inner and outer formes figured and the number of times each figure appears in each location. 67 The sequence table records, for each signature, any figures that appear within the gathering labeled by that signature. In the case of books printed in the usual fashion, there are two columns for each signature, one representing the inner forme and one the outer; in the case of half-sheet imposition by the work-and-turn method, only one column is required. Whatever page normally carries the figure is indicated at the top of the column, and all figures appearing in the column may be assumed to occur on that page except when a different page is entered in brackets after the figure. Thus, in the table below (for about half—the half that contains all the figures, as it happens—of Evans 35106, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 4, Philadelphia, 1799), inner formes are usually figured on $4 r , but inner I has its figure on 1 v instead: (i) (o) (i) (o) (i) (o) 4 ra 4 va 4 ra 4 va 4 ra 4 va A — *4 N — *2 Bb *2 — B — *4 O — *4 Cc *2 — C 2 *2[2 va ] P — *1 Dd — *2 D — 4 Q *4 — Ee — *4[2 va ] E — 2 R — *4 Ff — *1 F 4 — S — *4 Gg — 2 G — 4 T — — Hh — *2 H — 4 U — *4 Ii — *1 I *2[1 va ] — X — *2 Kk *4 *2 K — *4 Y — *4 Ll *2 — L — *1 Z — *1 Mm 2 *1[1 va ] M — *2 Aa *4 *2 Nn 2 1[2 va ] Information about size and position of figures is also included in the table: an asterisk marks those figures that are larger in size than the others in the same volume, and superscript “a” and “b” indicate the left and right halves of the lower margin, whether or not the letterpress appears in two columns. If the figures recorded here had been reported in one of the more usual compressed forms, the results might look like one of the following: 8-4 16-4 20-2 28-4 36-2 43-4 52-4 60-4 62-2 76-4 84-1 92-2 100-2 108-4 116-1 123-4 132-4 140-4 156-4 164-2 172-4 180-1 187-4 188-2 195-2 203-2 212-2 216-4 228-1 236-2 244-2 252-1 259-4 260-2 267-2 270-1 276-1 A4 v -4 B4 v -4 C2 v -2 D4 v -4 E4 v -2 F4 r -4 G4 v -4 H4 v -4 I1 v -2 K4 v -4 [ and so on ] A8-4 B16-4 C20-2 D28-4 E36-2 F43-4 G52-4 H60-4 I62-2 K76-4 [ and so on ] “1” on pp. 84, 116, 180, 228, 252, 270, 276; “2” on pp. 20, 36, 62, 92, 100, 164, 188, 195, 203, 212, 236, 244, 260, 267; “4” on pp. 8, 16, 28, 43, 52, 60, 76, 108, 123, 132, 140, 156, 172, 187, 216, 259 1: L4 v P4 v Z4 v Ff4 v Ii4 v Mm1 v Nn2 v . 2: C2 v E4 v I1 v M4 v N4 v X4 v Aa4 v Bb4 r Cc4 r Dd4 v Gg4 v Hh4 v Kk4 v Ll4 r . 4: A4 v B4 v D4 v F4 r G4 v H4 v K4 v O4 v Q4 r R4 v S4 v U4 v Y4 v Aa4 r Ee2 v Kk4 r . Although the last of these makes the basic pattern somewhat more apparent than the others, it is only with considerable difficulty that patterns can be discerned in any of these rather bewildering lists: it would take concentrated study to observe, for example, that the only sheets figured in both formes are Aa and Kk, that the only unfigured sheet is T, or that inner formes are figured only eight times—facts easily observable in the table given above. The advantages of this proposed sequence table are that one can see at a glance the deviations from a dominant pattern; one can easily study the patterns for outer and inner formes separately or in conjunction; and one notices where the unfigured formes fall in relation to the figured ones. It seems essential, if one is to have an overall view of a complex arrangement of figures, to record the figures in a concise fashion that, at the same time, does not sacrifice clarity of sequential and spatial arrangement to compression. Such tables as the one above not only reveal whatever pattern there is in the figures but also are economical of space and effort—for one table can serve as well for ten volumes as for one, simply by having separate columns for each book with only one set of signatures down the left side (similar to the arrangement Todd uses occasionally in his Burke bibliography). If one is trying to investigate the possibility of concurrent printing, for instance, or any other aspect of the relations among a number of volumes printed in the same shop during the same period, these multiple tables facilitate comparisons. The leaf references seem preferable to page numbers since they show immediately the position of each figure in terms of the structure of the gathering. (Since the length of individual books recorded in such a table will vary, dashes can be used to indicate unfigured formes or half-sheets, while signatures that do not appear in any given book can simply be left blank.) Similarly, the record of variant figures in multiple copies of the same title can be neatly displayed by assigning columns to various copies. The second kind of table in my suggested system is part of a “summary of figures” for each book. In long books containing several figures it becomes especially helpful to have statistical totals easily available. This summary, then, indicates the number of sheets figured in both formes, figured in only one forme, and entirely unfigured (or alternatively, whenever appropriate, the number of half-sheets figured). It includes a table (like the one of Povey's mentioned earlier) that records the number of times each figure appears on any given page of a gathering. These statistics are totaled to provide data on the number of inner and outer formes figured, the number of times each figure appears in inner or outer formes, and the number of times figures occur in each possible position. In the table below (again for the sample of Evans 35106), figure 2, for example, appears on the first leaf verso of one full-sheet gathering, three times on the fourth leaf recto, and nine times on $4 v ; it appears on four inner and nine outer formes, or thirteen times in the full-sheet gatherings of the volume: Summary of figures: 2 of 33 sheets figured in both formes, 30 figured in one forme, 1 unfigured; all 3 half-sheets figured. Figures appear near left margins. 68 Full sheets Full-sheet Totals Half-sheets Grand Totals Figs. 1 v 4 r 2 v 4 v 1 v 2 v 1 0 0 0 5 0(i) 5(0) 5 1 1 7 2 1 3 0 9 4(i) 9(0) 13 0 1 14 4 0 4 1 11 4(i) 12(0) 16 0 0 16 Totals 1 7 1 25 8(i) 26(0) 34 1 2 37 Page 050. It can also be readily seen from the table that $4 v is by far the most popular page for figuring in the volume (25 times) and that outer formes are figured more than three times as often as inner formes (26:8). Varying totals resulting from the discovery of variant figures in different copies may be included in the table by separating the varying totals for the same figure and location with short dashes and arranging them in the same order as the columns for the corresponding copies in the sequence table; thus, in the previous example, if three printings had been discovered through variant figures, the full-sheet portion of the first row of the summary table might read as follows: Figs. 1 v 4 r 2 v 4 v Totals 1 0-1-0 0-0-1 0-1-2 5-4-4 0-1-1(i) 5-5-6(0) 5-6-7 Page 051. The information in these summary tables is useful for discovering the standard practice in a given shop or the customary practice of a particular pressman; it brings further order into the content of the first table but is not a substitute for that table, which records the precise sequential arrangement of figures on which the generalizations in the summary are based. I have provided further examples of the use of this system in two articles on American press figures; 69 it is also employed in Donald D. Eddy's A Bibliography of John Brown (1971) and in Vander Meulen's bibliography of Pope's Dunciad. Eddy uses only the sequence tables and attaches a page reference to every figure rather than placing the most common location in the heading; Vander Meulen makes several other modifications, such as designating the position of the figure on the page with greater precision than I had suggested (“A3 r-a53 ” meaning that the figure is 53 mm from the left edge of the type page) and adapting the sequence tables to accommodate impressions in different formats (p. 154). Alterations may be necessary in any system as occasion warrants, but some such approach as this one seems to me to justify the space it requires by facilitating the comparison of copies and the discovery of additional varieties of figuring; it also makes patterns in figures readily detectable and thus may assist the further investigation of the nature and function of figuring. (g) Variation in furniture width When standing type or plates are reimposed for a second or later printing, any or all of the formes may be made up with an amount of furniture between the type-pages that is slightly different from the amount that was present in the imposition for the previous printing(s). Thus a measurement of the spaces between type-pages that were adjacent in the forme can be a way of distinguishing printings that do not seem to be otherwise distinguishable. This technique is potentially usable for analyzing books of all periods; but since it was not usually feasible in the early centuries of printing to keep large quantities of standing type, the technique clearly has a wider application for books of the past three centuries, and in fact it has so far been used primarily in connection with nineteenth- and twentieth-century books. Even in instances where variations in furniture width do not furnish the only way of distinguishing impressions, the fact of such variation is a physical characteristic deserving of record in a description. In 1957, Matthew J. Bruccoli (in Notes on the Cabell Collections at the University of Virginia ) measured the inner margins (gutters) of facing pages at the centers of gatherings as a way of recognizing reimposition. In the case of Jurgen, for example, he wrote, “the 2nd impression may be identified by the gutter measurement: at pp. 176-77 it is 31 mm., while in the 1st impression it is 36 mm.” (p. 33). Six years later he used gutter measurements to confirm the identification (based on reset passages) of four 1851 printings of The House of the Seven Gables and to locate a fifth “1851” printing not otherwise recognizable. In this instance he cited measurements from two locations (on pp. 120-121 the difference was 5 mm, and on pp. 216-217 it was 4 mm), and he expressed the view that a difference of at least 3 mm would be sufficient to take into account the possibility of paper shrinkage. 70 Obviously gutter measurements on any two conjugate leaves would be relevant, but the conjugate leaves at the centers of gatherings were selected because it is easier to make relatively accurate measurements at that point. But even there, and with the help of an inserted strip of paper, it is not easy to get accurate readings in tightly bound books (or in any book where the folding of the paper has loosened its fibers and stretched the paper). To avoid these problems, Peter L. Shillingsburg has suggested a system that eliminates the need for direct measurements of gutters, and in addition it enables one to consider differences in furniture between pages adjacent across what are now top edges and fore-edges as well as gutters. 71 The method is to hold a book so that light passes through a given leaf and to measure the distance (if any) between the outer (or inner) margin of the type-page on the recto and the outer (or inner) margin on the verso, noting whether the verso margin is to the left or right of the recto margin; then one performs the same operation on the conjugate leaf (or on any leaf containing the outer- and inner-forme type-pages that were adjacent in other directions to the recto and verso pages already measured). The figure that results from combining the two measurements (subtracting if both reflect shifts in the same direction or adding if the shifts are in different directions) should remain constant through all copies of an impression-sheet. (The actual register might differ in different copies, but this figure should remain the same.) When this “register-coefficient” (as one might call it) is different in two copies of a sheet, the width of the furniture was different in one or both of the formes from which the copies were printed, and therefore the two copies are probably from two different printings. Obviously the absence of such a difference does not necessarily mean that the copies are from the same printing; and this obvious point is of particular significance here, calling attention to a distinct limitation of the system. Since the measurements are only of relative differences, they would not reveal reimpositions in which the furniture, though indeed altered in width, was changed by the same amount in the outer and inner formes: the relation of the recto and verso type-page images would not reflect the fact that the actual amount of space between the type-pages in the forme had changed. Each system, therefore, has its advantages and disadvantages. When a book is loosely enough bound that the gutter measurement can be taken with relative confidence in its accuracy, that simple approach may be sufficient; but when direct gutter measurements are not possible or reliable, the other approach can be tried in case the situation is one in which it can be decisive. Indeed, it may be worth using both techniques, since it is possible for a variation to exist in one part of a forme and not in another, and the register-coefficient approach can result in discoveries involving leaves other than the center two in a gathering. But whether one is recording actual distances across gutters or register-coefficients, it is important to be able to report on an examination of every sheet, not only as an aid in discovering mixed sheets but also to take into account the contrary possibility that the furniture was not identical for every forme of a single printing. When there is no variation throughout a book, a brief statement provides an adequate account: “This printing can be identified by gutter measurements of 3.8 cm at the center of every gathering,” or “... by a register-coefficient of 1 mm on $1.8 (in contrast to 0 in the first printing).” But when there are differences, a table may be more helpful, as in these two hypothetical cases: Gutter $1.8 Register-coefficient A-C 3.6 cm A-B 1 mm D 3.8 cm C-F 0 E-G 3.7 cm G-K 1.33 mm If, in the second case, measurements on different pairs of leaves in different gatherings are required to locate variations, the leaf citations would have to be made following each signature rather than at the top of the column. (h) Plating evidence One of the basic questions to ask about the presswork stage of the production of a nineteenth- or twentieth-century book is whether the printing was done from type or from plates—and if from plates, whether they were relief or offset. The technique of relief plating—creating, from a type-page, a mould for producing a relief image of the type-page surface cast in a solid piece of metal—goes back at least to the early eighteenth century, but it did not become a practical method for commercial use until early in the nineteenth century. 72 Once available, the advantages that plates offered for handling, storing, and shipping meant that they would rapidly become popular. Stereotype plates were increasingly used by American book and magazine printers in the early decades of the nineteenth century, and by mid-century major American publishers ordered plates for nearly all their books and magazines. Electrotyping, another process that produced relief plates, largely replaced stereotyping in the last third of the century. In Britain, the use of plating grew somewhat more slowly, and some publishers had first printings made from type, reserving plates only for later printings. Although the majority of British and American books from the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century can be assumed to have been printed from plates, any given book may not have been so printed, and it is important for descriptive bibliographers to accumulate whatever evidence there is for deciding the matter, both as a fact of printing history and as a piece of information relevant to editors' assessments of textual variants. Although clues for distinguishing standing type from plates are not always available in every edition, bibliographers dealing with nineteenth century books have developed a repertoire of evidence to search for. 73 These have been written about primarily by Peter L. Shillingsburg and Michael Winship, and from their work 74 one can derive the following list of distinguishing features: (1) Type movement. Evidence of shifting type obviously means that plates were not used; even when there is no gross shifting, there is often slight movement (detectable with the use of a collating machine) both within a single printing and more commonly between printings. Absence of shifting does not of course prove that plates were used; but if lines that contain textual variants show no movement in the invariant parts, 75 and particularly if the revised readings are not aligned precisely, one can conclude the probable use of plates. (2) Lightness or darkness of typeface-images. The general grayness characteristic of impressions from heavily used plates offers too imprecise and subjective a test to be relied on; but when textual alterations were made in a plate, the new letters often make a noticeably darker or lighter impression than the surrounding text. (3) Batter. Damaged letters do not in themselves signify the use of plates, but batter around the edges of pages frequently does come from the handling of plates between printings. (4) Vestigial or multiple signatures. When, as often happens in American nineteenth-century books, the signatures do not coincide with the actual gatherings or when multiple sets of signatures to accommodate alternative formats are present, the printing is almost certainly from plates. (5) Dimensions of type-pages. Since images from plates may be smaller than those from the standing type (because of the shrinkage of moulds as they dry and of plates as they cool), varying type-page measurements in different copies of an edition can signify that some copies were printed from type and others from plates (or some from first- and some from second-generation plates)—so long as the variation is more than can be explained by paper shrinkage (which is usually greater along one dimension than the other). Descriptive bibliographers should check for all these potential clues and then state a conclusion with whatever degree of certainty the evidence warrants. Some of these categories of evidence, such as the move- ment of types, may be mentioned elsewhere in a presswork paragraph; the presence of signatures that do not match the gatherings might appropriately be taken up in the collation paragraph; and the dimensions of type-pages are a standard element in the typography paragraph. In reporting a conclusion about the use of plates, a bibliographer can simply refer to such evidence noted elsewhere and in addition should selectively cite any other evidence: Printed from plates, as evidenced by the vestigial signatures reported above and the apparent absence of any shifting type, even in some lines (e.g., 112.7 and 250.16) where the last letter fails to print. This first impression was probably printed from plates, since in the second impression some of the textual alterations (e.g., those at 105.17 and 195.8) are misaligned and have a dark appearance and since the type-page dimensions are identical in the two printings. In both these hypothetical examples, the parenthetical citations of selected page-line references allude to fuller lists elsewhere in the descriptions, without suggesting that all the entries in those lists provide relevant evidence (but naturally implying that none of the entries offers conflicting evidence). Books printed from offset plates, which came into prominent use in the twentieth century, can theoretically be distinguished from books produced by relief plates through the absence of indentations in the paper. 76 But the amount of indentation in some relief-plated books is so slight as to make this test one that it is hard to have complete confidence in. Fortunately there is at least one clue that is sometimes available: “offset slur,” the slight smearing of ink caused by improper contact between the offset blanket and the paper. Not usually visible without magnification, it consists of faint shadows pointing toward the trailing edge of the sheet as it went through the press (though it does not necessarily appear in every copy of an impression-sheet). Craig S. Abbott has explained how the directional nature of offset slur can be employed to work out possible impositions and to identify cancels and unmarked impressions. 77 He uses the words “inner” and “outer” to indicate whether the slur moves toward the inner or outer margin of a page and records the evidence in a table in which leaves and pages are grouped according to the units formed by their slur direction (adapted from p. 540): Leaves Pages Direction 1-8 i-x, 1-6 inner 9-16 7-22 outer 17-24 23-38 inner 25-32 39-54 outer [ and so on ] When descriptive bibliographers discover offset slur, they should probably record its occurrences fully in some such form as this, rather than simply reporting that the book was printed by an offset process, in order to make available the evidence underlying any conclusions about imposition and in order to encourage the development of further uses for this technique of analysis. All these proposals for reporting on typesetting and presswork are intended to be suggestive rather than prescriptive. They are meant only as examples of how one might handle certain production details that are basic to an understanding of the forms of books; but the precise method of treating these details in any given instance must emerge from the particular context. What I hope is that my comments will stimulate thought about the ways in which an account of these and other aspects of typesetting and presswork can be integrated into descriptive bibliographies— and thus will help bridge what is often perceived as a gap between descriptive and analytical bibliography. Descriptive bibliography is inevitably an analytical activity, and the results of bibliographical analysis should be regarded as a natural part of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 The word regularly used by printers is “composition” (hence the term “compositors” for those who “compose” the type); but I shall use “typesetting” here in order to avoid any confusion with another meaning of “composition,” authors' composing of their writings (since some descriptive bibliographies—such as Richard L. Purdy's 1954 Hardy, to cite a notable instance—do report on textual history and the manuscripts that precede the printed books). As for the persons who set type, I shall use “typesetters” and “compositors” interchangeably. 2 A similar comment appears in his discussion of running-titles, where he says, “This checking [of every running-title] is a necessary part of the analysis of the printing of a book which a scrupulous bibliographer should make before attempting its description” (p. 187). Paul Needham, too, lamenting the fact that the study of incunables often seems a separate field from the study of later books, has encouraged incunabulists to include in their descriptions—even the compressed ones in catalogues—more details that would link physical evidence in books with the analysis of their production; he emphasizes “the importance of organising bibliographical data in a way that responds to the reality of book production” (p. 52). See “ISTC as a Tool for Analytical Bibliography,” in Bibliography and the Study of 15th-Century Civilisation, ed. Lotte Hellinga and John Goldfinch (1987), pp. 39-54. On the role of analysis in descriptive bibliography and in its historical development, see also my “A Description of Descriptive Bibliography,” Studies in Bibliography, 45 (1992), 1-30 (esp. pp. 10-13), reprinted in Literature and Artifacts (1998), pp. 127-156 (esp. pp. 136-139); and my introduction to the 1994 paperback printing of Bowers's Principles. 3 In my Sandars Lectures of 1997 (not yet published), I attempted a general historical introduction to this field. Some historical overview is presently available, among other places, in my “Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century,” in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine: Essays on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Osler Library, ed. Philip M. Teigen (1982), pp. 55-79, and “The Evolving Role of Bibliography, 1884-1984,” in Books and Prints, Past and Future: Papers Presented at the Grolier Club Centennial Convocation, 26-28 April 1984 (1984), pp. 15-31. The fullest theoretical underpinning of analytical bibliography is supplied by Fredson Bowers's Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964), and the most detailed exposition of analytical techniques can be found in Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963)—which should be supplemented by Peter W. M. Blayney's The Texts of KING LEAR and Their Origins (1982), for its corrective commentary and its consideration of the printing of quartos. The most extensive listing of the writings on analytical bibliography is in my Introduction to Bibliography: Seminar Syllabus ( Book Arts Press; 1996 revision), pp. 169-198. 4 Many of these characteristics were of course unintended by the producers of an edition, and some bibliographers have been misled by the term “ideal copy” (as the goal of a description) into thinking that unintended features, or “errors,” are not part of what a description aims to record. But the concept of “ideal copy” properly covers all features of books that existed at the time those books left their producers' hands; it excludes only the characteristics of individual copies of books that result from what has happened to those copies in their subsequent life. See my “The Concept of Ideal Copy, ” SB, 33 (1980), 18-53. (An earlier article of mine, “The Use of Type Damage as Evidence in Bibliographical Description,” Library, 5th ser., 23 (1968), 328-351—which is drawn on below and which I still regard as valid in general—was written before I had arrived at this understanding of “ideal copy,” and therefore I no longer support its comments on that concept.) The evidences of the post-publication life of individual copies are not without interest, of course, for the study of the reception and use of books, and such details can be recorded or referred to in the paragraph of a description that identifies the specific copies examined. 5 An example is Laurie E. Maguire's “The Rise of the New Bibliography,” in her Shakespearean Suspect Texts: The “Bad” Quartos and Their Contexts (1996), pp. 21-71, 343-358. She finds W. W. Greg a “xenophobic” scholar whose “author-centered approach stems not just from imperialist attitudes but from Victorian religious piety and sentimental family values” (p. 64). Whether or not these points are accurate—or whether Greg and his colleagues made excessive claims of scientific rigor—has nothing to do with an evaluation of the actual techniques developed by the New Bibliography for the examination of physical evidence. 6 The most famous example is D. F. McKenzie's “Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices,” SB, 22 (1969), 1-75. My response to this essay can be found, among other places, in “Bibliography and Science,” SB, 27 (1974), 55-89 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 1-36) and in “Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942,” in The Book Encompassed: Studies in Twentieth-Century Bibliography, ed. Peter Davison (1992), pp. 24-36 (esp. pp. 29-31). Fredson Bowers had in fact already given an answer in his 1964 book Bibliography and Textual Criticism. ) Constructive discussion regarding responsible ways of proceeding with bibliographical analysis is also provided by Peter Davison in “Science, Method, and the Textual Critic,” SB, 25 (1972), 1-28, and “The Selection and Presentation of Bibliographic Evidence,” Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography, 1 (1977), 101- 136. 7 This University of Wisconsin dissertation, which is no doubt included (as it ought to be) in the microfilm collections of a number of research libraries, is readily available to anyone who wishes to order it, in either microfilm or xerographic form, from University Microfilms International of Ann Arbor (the order number is 81-20339). Some of Vander Meulen's later publications, growing out of the research for this bibliography and its projected revised and expanded form, show how descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography, textual study, and literary history all intertwine; see, for example, “ The Dunciad in Four Books and the Bibliography of Pope,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [ PBSA ], 83 (1989), 293-310. I wish to record here my indebtedness to Vander Meulen for his invaluable suggestions on the present paper; but he bears no responsibility for any errors that remain—or for my comments on his work. 8 But see note 13 below. Another questionable use of recognizable types has to do with presswork analysis: bibliographers have sometimes used the reappearance of particular types as a guide to the elapsed time between the distribution of one forme and the setting of another and thus (given average speeds of typesetting and printing) to the number of copies in the edition. Such calculations obviously do not take into account other jobs simultaneously in progress, and therefore they are not reliable. 9 Before Hinman, W. H. Bond had suggested the possibility that Elizabethan printers might have set by formes, but he did not use evidence from damaged type (“Casting Off Copy by Elizabethan Printers: A Theory,” PBSA, 42 [1948], 281- 291). Hinman's basic article is “Cast-Off Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare,” Shakespeare Quarterly, 6 (1955), 259-273; his fuller treatment of the use of identifiable types is in his Printing and Proof-Reading (see note 3 above), 1: 52-138. (See also Jesse C. Mills's summary of John Cook Wyllie's Rosenbach Lectures, “Detective in the Book World,” Graphic Arts Review, 23.5 [May 1960], 7-8, 46-48; and Robert K. Turner, “Reappearing Types as Bibliographical Evidence,” SB, 19 [1966], 198-209.) I have surveyed some of the ensuing work on setting by formes and have tried to show how it makes a contribution to printing history, in “Analytical Bibliography and Renaissance Printing History,” Printing History, 3.1 (1981), 24-33, reprinted as “Analytical Bibliography and Printing History” in Literature and Artifacts (1998), pp. 291-306. Sometimes bibliographers, including Hinman, having established that a book was set by formes, try to determine the order in which formes were set by noting the reappearances of particular types. But this use of identifiable types is risky because it is likely to involve assumptions (e.g., that the types used in one forme would not be distributed in time to be available for use in the one set next) that do not allow for concurrent work on different jobs. For an essential and salutary supplement to Hinman, taking up such matters as this, see Blayney's Texts of KING LEAR (see note 3 above), esp. pp. 57-58, 91-94, 176-177. Blayney has also provided, in The First Folio of Shakespeare (written to accompany a 1991 Folger Library exhibition), a very clear introduction to compositor analysis and the significance of setting by forms (pp. 9-14). (A list of the literature can be found in my syllabus [see note 3 above], pp. 144-145.) As Lotte Hellinga has pointed out, Henry Bradshaw had suggested, as early as 1877, the possibility of setting by formes in fifteenth-century printing, and Konrad Haebler discussed the matter in 1925; her own “Notes on the Order of Setting a Fifteenth-Century Book,” Quaerendo, 4 (1974), 64-69, depends not on type damage but on the correlation between the markings in a printer's-copy manuscript and the techniques for compressing and expanding text evident in the printed book. Of course, determining the manner of setting (seriatim or by formes) does not in itself provide direct evidence of which side of the sheet was printed first (a matter taken up below in section c under “Presswork”). Similarly, the fact that the earliest printed books (before roughly 1475) were routinely printed one page at a time (not by imposed formes) does not theoretically rule out the possibility that setting could sometimes have proceeded by formes (i.e., sides of the sheet). But clearly the standard rules for using identifiable types to determine setting by formes (as outlined in the next paragraph) are not applicable to books printed one page at a time; for if types could be distributed and reused immediately after the printing of each page, identifiable types could reappear on any page, regardless of whether the order of setting the pages were seriatim or according to the side of the sheet (though if a compositor set a new page while printing was taking place, types could not appear on both pages of any pair that was set consecutively). (On single-page printing, see also notes 24 and 37 below.) 10 Although some bibliographers have proposed, as an additional motivation, that setting by formes minimized idle press time, the argument is not convincing because efficiency of press use would not have been dependent on the handling of a particular book but rather on the management of all the jobs simultaneously in progress in the shop. If, however, there was some cause for urgency in finishing a particular book as expeditiously as possible, setting by formes would be a help by decreasing the time needed for typesetting before the first forme could go on the press. (Concurrent printing on two or more presses would also be a help and, if accompanied by concurrent setting, would be another benefit of setting by formes.) 11 On the general question of the selection of evidence for publication (which is an issue relevant to all the categories of evidence to be considered below), see also Peter Davison's “The Selection and Presentation of Bibliographic Evidence” (see note 6 above), which in addition takes up the dangers of selectivity in examining the evidence in a single copy and in deciding on the number of copies to be examined. On the latter point, see David Shaw, “A Sampling Theory for Bibliographical Research,” Library, 5th ser., 27 (1972), 310-319. 12 “Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: The Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors,” SB, 43 (1990), 95-164; “Bibliographical Methods for Identifying Unknown Printers in Elizabethan / Jacobean Books,” SB, 44 (1991), 183- 228. Weiss shows his method in operation in “Shared Printing, Printer's Copy, and the Text(s) of Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres, ” SB, 45 (1992), 71-104. He had earlier explained the inadequacy of facsimiles for certain kinds of detailed typographic research, such as demonstrating the use of standing type and identifying some running-titles, because in facsimiles one cannot see the actual type impressions but only the total ink smears and therefore cannot identify type damage with sufficient precision: “Reproductions of Early Dramatic Texts as a Source of Bibliographical Evidence,” Text, 4 (1988), 237-268. See also his important review of W. Craig Ferguson's Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England (1989) in PBSA, 83 (1989), 539-546. As for the earlier period, Paul Needham, in “ISTC as a Tool of Analytical Bibliography” (see note 2 above), has pointed out that—despite the great amount of work done on fifteenth-century types—very little effort has been made to distinguish fonts “derived in full or in large part from a single set of punches, but used by more than one press” (p. 49). 13 Though Hinman, in Printing and Proof-Reading (see note 3 above), did find evidence for associating the First Folio compositors with type- cases, and Paul Werstine has continued this line of investigation in “Cases and Compositors in the Shakespeare First Folio Comedies,” SB, 35 (1982), 206-234. 14 Although, as Davison suggested in 1977 (see note 6 above), one cannot rule out the possibility that a compositor moved from one shop to another—or, for that matter, that a font may have so moved. Weiss's 1991 article (see note 12 above) makes some comments on the usefulness of font analysis in discovering shared printing between shops (pp. 188- 190). 15 David Vander Meulen makes this point, in “The Dunciad in Four Books and the Bibliography of Pope” (see note 7 above), when he says that bibliography serves us well “simply by filling out our understanding of the production of particular books and providing us with further evidence of the customs of a printer or a period” (p. 306). 16 There are, of course, other compositorial customs that reflect the conventions of particular times and places more than they do the habits of individuals—such as the choice and placement of signatures, the pattern of catchwords, the style of pagination, and the form of imprint dates. Such matters are discussed in R. A. Sayce's “Compositorial Practices and the Localization of Printed Books, 1530-1800,” Library, 5th ser., 21 (1966), 1-45 (reprinted, with additions and corrections, as a pamphlet in 1979); he suggests that “standard methods of bibliographical description should be modified to include more detailed and precise information about some of the features discussed here” (p. 45). An expansion of this approach to localization has been taken up by Frans A. Janssen, who also reviews the reception history of Sayce's work, in “Layout as Means of Identification,” Quaerendo, 25 (1995), 46-58. 17 D. F. McKenzie has shown that compositors sometimes placed blocks in their composing sticks to shorten the measure for verse lines, and Anthony Hammond has demonstrated that this practice caused compositors' habits in some verse lines to be uncharacteristic in the same ways as in justified prose lines; see McKenzie's “`Indenting in the Stick' in the First Quarto of King Lear (1608),” PBSA, 67 (1973), 125-130, and Hammond's “ The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop,” SB, 39 (1986), 135-176 (esp. pp. 137-142). Even in justified lines it is sometimes possible to recognize different compositors' habits by noting whether adjustments in the spaces between words are usually made in the first or second halves of lines; see Herman Doh, “Compositorial Responsibility in Fortune by Land and Sea, 1655,” Library, 5th ser., 29 (1974), 379-404. 18 One example of compositor analysis applied to a nineteenth-century book occurs in Fredson Bowers's edition (1965) of Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables (see pp. li-lv, lvii, 393-398); this example is not comparable, however, with the usual analyses of compositorial stints in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books because here there is a printer's-copy manuscript with compositorial stints indicated, and the analysis is to see whether the printed pages corresponding to those stints exhibit any marked differences. One reason that compositor analysis is less fruitful for books of this period is that the increasing influence of publishers' house-styles (accompanying the rise of large publishers) makes the practices of individual compositors more difficult to detect. 19 Hinman, as usual, provides a basic introduction in Printing and Proof-Reading (see note 3 above), 1: 178-226; and Blayney, as usual, in his Texts of KING LEAR (see note 3 above), offers an incisive cautionary supplement, pp. 151-187. Blayney's discussion, indeed, is an important assessment of the whole undertaking and a useful demonstration of a helpful way of laying out the evidence. See also Alice Walker, “Compositor Determination and Other Problems in Shakespearian Texts,” SB, 7 (1955), 3-15; T. H. Hill [i.e., Howard-Hill], “Spelling and the Bibliographer,” Library, 5th ser., 18 (1963), 1-28; and the many articles listed in my syllabus (see note 3 above), pp. 137-143. Slight differences in the width of the type-page (or column) can serve as a preliminary (and, by itself, inconclusive) guide to sections of text set by different compositors; see Bowers, “Bibliographical Evidence from the Printer's Measure,” SB, 2 (1949-50), 153-167. Another kind of evidence that can contribute to compositor identification is turned types; see Robin Dix and Trudi Laura Darby, “The Bibliographical Significance of the Turned Letter,” SB, 46 (1993), 263-270. 20 Hinman's and Blayney's styles of tables for presenting spelling evidence can be seen, respectively, in Printing and Proof-Reading (see note 3 above), 1:369-424, and Texts of KING LEAR (see note 3 above), pp. 160-177. Another example of a series of tables reporting evidence for capitalization, punctuation, speech-prefixes, and spelling is the appendix to Susan Zimmerman's “The Uses of Headlines: Peter Short's Shakespearian Quartos I Henry IV and Richard III, ” Library, 6th ser., 7 (1985), 218-255. Anthony Hammond, in “ The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop” (see note 17 above), uses a compact table (pp. 153-156) in which each vertical column is headed by a number referring to a separate description of the discriminating feature being reported on in that column. 21 But they can occur later: see, for example, Paul Eggert, “A Cautionary Tale: Stop-Press Correction in The Recollections of Geoffry Hamlyn (1859),” Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin, 19 (1995), 267-269. 22 The first two of these are taken up below (the first involves evidence discussed in sections d, e, and g; the second in section h). As for discovering imposition, one of the techniques ingeniously worked out by Oliver L. Steele involves analyzing the patterns of the rough edges of leaves. See his “On the Imposition of the First Edition of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, ” Library, 5th ser., 17 (1962), 250-255; and “Half-Sheet Imposition of Eight-Leaf Quires in Formes of Thirty-Two and Sixty-Four Pages,” SB, 15 (1962), 274-278. Although the conclusion relates to presswork, it is likely to be reported elsewhere in a description than in a paragraph on presswork: it would probably appear as the format designation in the collation paragraph, and the evidence itself might well go into the paragraph on binding (since the characteristics of the edges of the leaves are an aspect of how the edges were treated in binding). (Other examples of bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and twentieth- century books are listed in my syllabus [see note 3 above], pp. 157-161.) For similar reasons, I have not attempted in what follows to comment on all the techniques for identifying the format of hand-printed books, though some of the evidence discussed below can be of assistance in that process; a format statement is already a well-established element in a description, and such standard tests as noting the direction of chainlines and the position of watermarks relative to leaves are appropriately reported as part of the examination of paper. 23 Headlines without such obvious distinguishing features can sometimes be identified by the kind of microscopic analysis Adrian Weiss described in 1990 and 1991 (see note 12 above) or, somewhat less precisely, by the use of a collating machine. Another method, which requires going to the trouble of making transparent copies for superimposition, is explained by Randall McLeod in “A Technique of Headline Analysis, with Application to Shakespeares Sonnets, 1609,” SB, 32 (1979), 197-210. 24 The absence of recurrent headlines in a half-sheet obviously does not prove anything. See Fredson Bowers, “Running-Title Evidence for Determining Half-Sheet Imposition,” SB, 1 (1948-49), 199-202; and see note 38 below. In the case of early books printed one page at a time, the sheets were generally cut in half before printing (for formats smaller than folio); for some discussion of this point, see Paul Needham, “Res papirea: Sizes and Formats of the Late Medieval Book,” in Rationalisierung der Buchherstellung im Mittelalter und in der frühen Neuzeit, ed. Peter Rück and Martin Boghardt (1994), pp. 123-145 (esp. pp. 127-128). This process of printing on precut half-sheets is obviously very different from either of the two kinds of “half-sheet imposition” (described just above), in which full formes and full sheets of paper were used to produce printed sheets that were later cut in half. The recurrence of identical headlines on pages printed on the same side of a half-sheet is evidence of printing one page at a time—as are the recurrence of identifiable types on such pages (see note 9 above) and a pattern of type-indentations that displays both first- and second-side printing on the same side of the sheet (see note 37 below). 25 For the early announcements, see Fredson Bowers, “Notes on Running Titles as Bibliographical Evidence,” Library, 4th ser., 19 (1938-39), 315- 338; and two pieces in English Institute Annual 1941 (1942)—Bowers's “The Headline in Early Books,” pp. 185-205, and Charlton Hinman's “New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence,” pp. 207- 222. Two classic examples of the advanced use of headlines are Bowers's “An Examination of the Method of Proof-Correction in Lear, ” Library, 5th ser., 2 (1947-48), 20-44, and Hinman's Printing and Proof-Reading (see note 3 above), 1: 171-178. Criticisms of this kind of analysis can be found in McKenzie's “Printers of the Mind” (see note 6 above) and Blayney's Texts of KING LEAR (see note 3 above), pp. 122-125. The necessity for recognizing that different jobs were simultaneously in progress in the printing shop (a basic element in these criticisms) has been confirmed by Adrian Weiss's demonstration that a pamphlet of Middleton's was a low-priority job produced in discontinuous intervals when it could be fitted into the work schedule for a high-priority job; see “A `Fill-In' Job: The Textual Crux and Interrupted Printing in Thomas Middleton's The Triumph of Honor and Virtue (1622),” PBSA, 93 (1999), 53-73. For a listing of the literature of headline analysis, see my syllabus (see note 3 above), pp. 149, 155; on the related topic of proofreading, see note 50 below. Since the box-rules around the pages of the First Folio (unlike the center rules) were reused as part of the skeleton, they can be analyzed along with the headlines; see John W. Shroeder, The Great Folio of 1623: Shakespeare's Plays in the Printing House (1956), esp. pp. 59-91, and Hinman's review of it in Shakespeare Quarterly, 8 (1957), 219-222. For a more general theory of the bibliographical use of identifiable rules, see Ernest W. Sullivan, II, “Marginal Rules as Evidence,” SB, 30 (1977), 171-180. 26 Running-titles enter bibliographical descriptions in other ways as well. It has become standard, following Bowers's recommendations in the Principles (pp. 186-192), to transcribe the running-titles and their variants in a separate paragraph (often just after the transcription of the head-title or the listing of the contents). In addition, a comprehensive paragraph on typography notes the style and size of the type in the running-titles, along with associated rules and the distance from the top line of text (see my “The Identification of Type Faces in Bibliographical Description,” PBSA, 60 [1966], 185-202). But these two treatments of running-titles are somewhat different in their focus from the identification of skeleton-formes. Indeed, Bowers's discussion of running-titles in the Principles struggles rather unsuccessfully with the problem of combining transcriptions of running-titles with a record of recurrent headlines, since some of the variations that make a headline identifiable are not readily transcribed and since a listing of recurrences that is subordinated to a record of variants (as in his “preferred form” on p. 192) does not facilitate the recognition of skeleton patterns. 27 In Blayney's system, a superscript figure indicates a variant of the identifiable headline, and an asterisk announces that the earlier state appears in some copies. When using his system—or, indeed, a numerical system—one should perhaps caution readers that the sequential labeling of headlines according to the order of their appearance in a book is not meant to carry any information about the order in which they were placed on the press. 28 “ The Disappointment: A Disappointment,” Library, 6th ser., 6 (1984), 50-60. There would be an argument—especially in dealing with long books containing many nonrecurrent headlines—for using a different kind of symbol (e.g., X) to stand for all nonrecurrent headlines, so that the lower-case letters would always designate headlines that reappear somewhere. At the opposite extreme, if a book shows only recurrent whole skeletons (and never any shifting combinations of individual headlines), there would be no need for designating the individual headlines; the letters (or other symbols) could then signify skeletons as wholes. 29 An alternative approach would be the reverse of this one: that is, making individual headlines rather than pages the dominant organizing principle. See, for example, Susan Zimmerman's “The Uses of Headlines” (see note 20 above), where a portion of one of her tables reads “Headline #2 A3 v , C3 v , E3 v , G3 v , I3 v ” (p. 250). It seems to me that this system does not make the pattern of headlines as immediately clear as Blayney's does and could not deal as well with long books or complex patterns. 30 Vander Meulen, who in his Dunciad bibliography (see note 7 above) uses roman numerals to designate different settings of headlines, capitalizes them for rectos, leaving lower case to indicate versos (pp. 82-86); the same record appears on p. 275 of his “The Printing of Pope's Dunciad, 1728,” SB, 35 (1982), 271-285. In the Blayney system, one could use capital and lower-case letters in the same way to show at a glance which headlines were not interchangeable, though if one has page designations at the top of each column this refinement might not be of much additional help. Vander Meulen's system, which involves other codes as well, is worth studying—especially in the form it took in his 1989 PBSA article (see note 7 above)—as an example of an attempt to convey symbolically several kinds of information (such as recurring sub-groups). 31 For comments on how points were used in some incunables, see Irvine Masson, “Digression on Pinholes and Their Interpretation,” in his The Mainz Psalters and Canon Missae, 1457-1459 (1954), pp. 16-22, supplemented by Kenneth Povey, “Pinholes in the 1457 Psalter,” Library, 5th ser., 11 (1956), 18-22, and Allan Stevenson, The Problem of the Missale speciale (1967), p. 342. See also Paul Needham, “Paul Schwenke and Gutenberg Scholarship: The German Contribution, 1885-1921,” PBSA, 84 (1990), 241-264, which on p. 258 comments on Schwenke's use of pin-hole evidence in his Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des ersten Buchdrucks (1900). Even when points were used to avoid paper slippage, type-page images could be affected by slippage of the frisket mask, and such “frisket-bite” has been commented on in connection with incunables by Walter J. Partridge in “The Type-Setting and Printing of the Mainz Catholicon,” Book Collector, 35 (1986), 21- 52 (see pp. 42-44), and Paul Needham in “Slipped Lines in the Mainz Catholicon: A Second Opinion,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1993, pp. 25-29 (see p. 29). (See also the references in note 72 below.) In the machine-press period, the cylinder machine had grippers to hold the paper in place; the marks left by these grippers are analogous to point-holes for purposes of bibliographical analysis, but no work—as far as I am aware—has been devoted to studying them. 32 For formats that involved folding the paper so as to bisect its longer dimension, the points were placed in the middle of the two longer sides of the tympan but were set different distances in toward its center, thus ensuring that sheets could only be turned end for end, not side for side; for duodecimo, the points were placed one-third of the way down from the frisket end of the tympan and equidistant from the longer edges of the tympan, so that sheets had to be turned side for side, not end for end. 33 See Foxon, “The Printing of Lyrical Ballads 1798,” Library, 5th ser., 9 (1954), 221-241, and “On Printing at One Pull and Distinguishing Impressions by Point-Holes,” Library, 5th ser., 11 (1956), 284-285; Povey, “A Century of Press Figures,” Library, 5th ser., 14 (1959), 251-273 (see pp. 261-262); and Maslen, “Point-Holes as Bibliographical Evidence,” Library, 5th ser., 23 (1968), 240-241. 34 In such cases, only one leaf would be named (the one on which the hole appears), rather than two leaves as in the example above. 35 It may be that Vander Meulen's use of the percent sign in influential articles like his “The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad ” ( SB, 37 [1984], 58-81) has made this symbol well enough established that one should not now propose alternatives to it. But Vander Meulen has written to me that he chose the percent sign only because it was present on typewriters and not otherwise used in bibliographical description. More symbols are now available in standard character sets on personal computers, including some that might possibly be more appropriate (like §) but not normally including the vertical wavy line suggested by John A. Lane in “Arthur Nicholls and His Greek Type for the King's Printing House,” Library, 6th ser., 13 (1991), 297-322 (see p. 318). Vander Meulen now regards Lane's choice as ideal. 36 “The Optical Identification of First Formes,” SB, 13 (1960), 189-190. He also reported on the incidence of outer and inner first-formes in a sampling of 201 books (totaling 5338 sheets) in “Working to Rule, 1600-1800: A Study of Pressmen's Practice,” Library, 5th ser., 20 (1965), 13-54. 37 Or each page in the case of those incunables printed page by page in page-number order. (Obviously the pattern of indentations resulting from printing single pages in page- number order could not occur in full-sheet-forme printing.) Paul Needham has noted that Heinrich Wallau as early as 1900 had used this test for identifying incunables printed page by page; see “Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper,” SB, 47 (1994), 23-64 (p. 27). But R. B. McKerrow, when discussing single-page printing in An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), referred first to the successive printing of individual pages of a given forme; in such a situation, of course, the indentations would be the same as if the whole forme had been printed together (p. 57). 38 Although not necessarily: a less likely possibility is that two half- sheets were worked together and that there was an interruption in the printing. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that half-sheet gatherings showing no variation in multiple copies cannot be assumed to have been produced by the method in which two half-sheets are worked together, simply because one may not have looked at enough copies to come across one showing the opposite pattern of indentation. See Kenneth Povey, “On the Diagnosis of Half-Sheet Impositions,” Library, 5th ser., 11 (1956), 268-272. See also note 24 above. 39 The copy numbers cited here (which could be used as needed in other paragraphs of the description as well) would be identified in the paragraph recording all the copies examined—as illustrated in my “A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary,” SB, 40 (1987), 1-30. 40 Other possible situations are obviously part-sheet gatherings and singletons (cancels or inserted leaves). The former require no special accommodation, though the “mixed” category would probably have a different significance, most likely signaling part-sheet imposition in which all type-pages are on the press at one time (work-and-turn). (The part- sheet gatherings resulting from impositions designed for separately gathered offcuts—as when a duodecimo is gathered in alternating 8s and 4s—could similarly be treated like full-sheet gatherings, and a mixed pattern would have the same possible explanations—even in the unlikely instance of the mixture occurring in a single copy of a book, where two companion part-sheet gatherings derive from two different full sheets. Vander Meulen, in an 8/4 situation, links the related gatherings with an oblique line: “ I: C/D, G/H, P/Q, R/S; O: A/B; Mixed: E/F, I/K, L/M, N/O” [p. 222].) For singletons, first-forme impressions can be identified as “recto” and “verso,” as Vander Meulen suggests. 41 In “Working to Rule” (see note 36 above), this example from p. 35. On detecting felt and mould sides, see Allan H. Stevenson, “Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence,” SB, 6 (1954), 181-195; see also pp. 33-35 of Paul Needham's “Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper” (see note 37 above). For books with press figures, Povey also incorporated a record of figures into the same tables, to facilitate investigating any correlations, by adding two more horizontal lines, labeled “Figure (i)” and “Figure (o)” (and including page references, as in “5 v 4”). (On press figures, see section f below.) 42 Bowers, in the Principles, did say, “It is no part of the bibliographer's normal responsibility to collate the text of each copy of an edition that he examines in search of textual variants made in press”; however, he immediately added, “when departures from normal printing indicate the possibility of a corresponding upheaval in the text, it is his business to investigate the slightest piece of evidence, even if it be no more than a change in pagination, and to interpret his findings after a minute comparison of the text in the affected formes” (p. 30). The second part of his statement obviously undercuts the first; but logic here yielded to a hesitation to burden descriptive bibliographers with textual collation (as it has often done in other similar discussions). 43 That is, from the point of view of authorial intention, although there are times when authors consider certain visual features to be parts of their works, which then become mixed-media works. From the point of view of publishers and readers, on the other hand, many or all of the physical features of books may be regularly regarded as integral to the verbal works presented in them, since those features often play a role in readers' responses. For an elaboration of these points, see my A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989) and the preface to (and many passages in) my Literature and Artifacts (1998). 44 I have given a fuller historical sketch of the uses of and responses to “points” on pp. 332-335 of my “The Use of Type Damage as Evidence in Bibliographical Description” (see note 4 above). Abuse of points has by no means died out, but an encouraging sign is the sensible approach taken in a recent article on Huckleberry Finn for a popular book-collecting magazine—especially since Huckleberry Finn is notorious for the number of “points” it contains and for the uses to which they have been put. See Kevin MacDonnell, “Collecting Mark Twain: Huck Finn among the Issue-Mongers,” Firsts, 8.9 (September 1998), 28-35. 45 Because the research underlying an edition and a descriptive bibliography is largely the same, it is sensible, when feasible, for both products to be goals of a single project. Then full reports of certain categories of information can be assigned, as part of a master plan, to whichever of the two they fit most appropriately, with condensed statements on these matters placed in the other volume. There may, of course, be some topics that require full treatment in both, if both volumes are to be reasonably self-contained. 46 For examples of bibliographies that report textual variants based on complete collations, see Craig S. Abbott, Marianne Moore (1977); James L. W. West III, William Styron (1977); and Stuart Wright, Randall Jarrell (1986) and Peter Taylor (1988). 47 If duplicate sets of plates were manufactured for a given book, one must keep in mind the possibility that such alterations might be made to the set in current use and not to the second set being held for future use. See Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt, ” SB, 11 (1958), 263-268; and “A Mirror for Bibliographers: Duplicate Plates in Modern Printing,” PBSA, 54 (1960), 83-88. (See also note 55 below.) 48 In instances where the typographical variations are the only means of distinguishing the first and second (or any other two) impressions, the list of differences should normally appear in the entry for the first one, with a cross-reference to it in the entry for the second. 49 For fuller discussion of this point, see my “The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State, ” PBSA, 69 (1975), 17-66. Bibliographers should remember that intra-impression textual variants may have been produced in a manner that was not precisely “stop- press”; as Adrian Weiss has shown (see note 25 above), if the book or pamphlet in question was a fill-in” job, such alterations may have been made during an interruption in the printing of forme while a high-priority job took precedence. 50 They are also taken up in numerous articles, often in connection with analysis of the proofreading process; for a list of many of these articles, see my syllabus (see note 3 above), pp. 150-152; see also note 21 above. A recent article that discusses the selective recording of stop-press variants (drawing on Blayney's comments in his 1996 revision of Hinman's 1968 The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare ) is Anthony James West's “A Model for Describing Shakespeare First Folios, with Descriptions of Selected Copies,” Library, 6th ser., 21 (1999), 1-49 (see esp. pp. 12-13, p. 49, and the sample descriptions, as on p. 17). 51 One of the “Press-Variants” paragraphs in Tom Jones (1974) begins as follows (P. 1052): “Vol. I, sig. C10, p. 43.7-8 (55.33) uncorrected: `Reason|cry out' (ViU2, CtY); corrected: `Reason|to cry out' (BM, ViU1).” Although such paragraphs display a more compressed style of press-variant record in the context of bibliographical description, they still seem rather cumbersome (with their unnecessary “sig.,” “ uncorrected, ” “ corrected, ” and the like). An example of a still more compressed form is offered by the descriptions in Melvyn and Joan New's edition (1978) of Tristram Shandy, where a typical press-variant entry is “A8a, 6: disasterous|disasterous” (p. 912); one can accept the omission of a page number and the specification of whether the forme is outer or inner as not absolutely necessary, but a decision not to identify the copies that have each reading—while perhaps permissible in a description attached to an edition if the information is supplied in the textual apparatus—is not excusable in a separate descriptive bibliography. 52 This style is similar to that employed by Arthur Friedman in The Plays of William Wycherley (1979), except that he identifies the forme on a separate line and places the corrected reading first, as in “11.21 (23.78) Women] BL, CU, LU, N, QC; Weomen Bod ” (p. 117). Blayney's system (in The Texts of KING LEAR [see note 3 above] pp. 559-629) can perhaps be seen as intermediate between Bowers's and this one, as far as compactness is concerned. Blayney gives the variants in columns, with each horizontal line labeled by a page-line citation (as “1 v 31”), but he uses a separate line for naming each forme and a separate table for showing which state of each forme is in each copy examined. 53 Another example of a selective record of shifting types placed within the paragraph on typography can be found in my “A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary” (see note 39 above). 54 Obviously any sheets not mentioned in this selective listing cannot be assumed to be without known variation, just as other variations besides the ones listed may be present in the sheets that are in fact referred to. The requirement stipulated above in regard to variations between printings—that every sheet be taken into account—would be pointless for intra-impression variations unless they were to be listed in their entirety (which, as stated above, does not seem sensible). 55 When dealing with copies printed from plates, one must also be aware of the possible use of duplicate plates, in which case copies showing damage at any given point were not necessarily printed later than copies without such damage, since an undamaged duplicate set of plates may have been brought into use precisely because the first set was damaged. (See also note 47 above.) As for the use of plate damage in determining imposition, see Oliver L. Steele, “Evidence of Plate Damage as Applied to the First Impression of Ellen Glasgow's The Wheel of Life, ” SB, 16 (1963), 223-231. 56 In my “The Use of Type Damage as Evidence in Bibliographical Description” (see note 4 above), I have offered some detailed suggestions for the collating of copies of the same edition (preferably on a collating machine), preparing a check-sheet for use in further checking, examining additional copies (beyond those that have been fully collated), and reporting the results (see pp. 337-351). An example of the usefulness of noting anomalies, even though they are identical in the copies examined, is offered by the original Murray edition of Melville's Typee. Copies with the 1846 title page may have either “Pomare” or “Pomarea” in the first line of page 19. The form that runs throughout later impressions is “Pomare,” and if all the 1846 copies selected for collation happened also to be “Pomare” copies, there might be no way of knowing to check for a possible variant at this point. But if the collator had noticed a nick in the headline rule just above and had recorded it as an abnormality, the discovery would not be a matter of chance but of routine and systematic investigation—for the rule was damaged when the “a” was removed, leaving permanent evidence that an earlier state existed. A photograph of this evidence, along with five other photographs of significant type damage in books by Melville, appears in the abridged reprinting of my article in Journal of Typographic Research, 3 (1969), 259-276 (see pp. 273-276). 57 Bearing types also sometimes were mistakenly inked and therefore left inked impressions: see Curt F. Bühler. “The First Edition of Ficino's De Christiana Religione: A Problem in Bibliographical Description,” SB, 18 (1965), 248-252 (reprinted in his Early Books and Manuscripts [1973], pp. 307-312), and the articles cited in his footnotes 13 and 14. See also, for good illustrations of inked bearer type, John R. Turner, “The Printing of Trissino's De la volgare eloquenzia, ” Library, 6th ser., 4 (1982), 307-313 (supplemented by Peter W. M. Blayney in 5 [1983], 175-176); and Susan M. Felch's edition of The Collected Works of Anne Vaughan Lock (1999), pp. lxx-lxxiv. McLeod's lectures, entitled (when delivered) “Material Narratives,” have not yet been published, and I am grateful to him for letting me read them in their present form. His resourcefulness and ingenuity in discovering and using new kinds of bibliographical evidence have also been directed to other bookmaking activities in addition to presswork. For instance, his lectures make use of the evidence of folded corners of leaves (and the resulting impressions on adjacent leaves) in a copy of Estienne's quarto Hebrew Bible to show that, in the process of pressing and repressing folded gatherings in a standing press prior to binding, the gatherings were not always in their alphabetical sequence (and the turned corners were perhaps intended to signal the disjunctions). When deckle edges are visible in such turned-corner impressions, one may be able to use them to figure the dimensions of the sheet; when imperfections on the platen of the standing press leave marks on the paper, the varying positions of these identifiable marks can enable one to estimate the size of the platen, and the presence of those marks in different books can potentially indicate which ones were bound in the same bindery. McLeod deals with the rolling press for engravings in a published article, “Imagic” ( Studies in the Literary Imagination, 32 [1999], 190-215), where he demonstrates, using an accidentally turned leaf-corner (and evidence of a plateedge burr) in a copy of Harington's translation of Orlando Furioso, that in some instances a whole printed folio-in-sixes gathering, folded inside out, was placed in the rolling press in order to add an engraving to one of the pages of its central opening. Still other kinds of unintended impressions—from both the presswork and the postpresswork stages—can be found. For example, there are the impressions made by types that were accidentally pulled out of the forme (most probably by the inking ball) and landed horizontally on the forme, or by extraneous types or other items that got locked up in, or fell on, the forme: see the examples illustrated in Victor Scholderer's “The Shape of Early Type,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1927, pp. 24-25 (reprinted in his Fifty Essays in Fifteenth- and Sixteenth-Century Bibliography, ed. Dennis E. Rhodes [1966], pp. 106-107); Curt F. Bühler's “Caxton Studies,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1940, pp. 169-176 (see p. 174); Blayney's Texts of KING LEAR (see note 3 above), p. 140; and Roger E. Stoddard's Marks in Books (1985), item 7. And there are impressions made by objects left in copies by the binder—like the impressions of scissors reported by Blayney in The Shakespeare First Folio (1991), pp. 32-33, which would enter a description only in the record of examined copies. 58 These figures are not the only other marks besides signatures that can appear in the direction line: some late-seventeenth- and eighteenth-century books, for example, have asterisks, daggers, and other symbols on the first page of gatherings as a way of informing the binder of the particular type of paper used, in cases where two issues on different papers were produced. These “paper-quality marks,” as B. J. McMullin has named them, would probably be best recorded in a description in the paragraph on paper. See McMullin, “Paper-Quality Marks and the Oxford Bible Press 1682-1717,” Library, 6th ser., 6 (1984), 39-49. Even though such marks appear on the rectos of the first leaves of gatherings (where press figures rarely occur), they are still sometimes confused with press figures, since these same symbols (rather than numbers) were occasionally used as press figures, especially before the 1720s. (McMullin has also called attention to the occasional use of signing by page numbers relative to the gathering, in “Signing by the Page,” SB, 48 [1995], 259-268.) Another kind of number that might at first be confused with press figures is the “sheet number,” described by McMullin from some late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century books (a series of consecutive numbers, one per sheet, in instances where each sheet furnishes more than one gathering, and thus more than one signature); see “Sheet Numbers, `Constable's Miscellany' and Irma, ” Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin, 17 (1993), 33-43. (These are to be distinguished from the numbers that W. A. Jackson also called “sheet numbers”— figures indicating the total number of sheets, or sometimes of quires, in a book, found on the title page or last page of some continental books of the sixteenth century; see “Printed Quire and Sheet Numbers,” Harvard Library Bulletin, 6 [1954], 96- 102, 363-374; cf. Library, 5th ser., 16 [1961], 197-201. See also Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer. “Fabriquer un livre au XVIe siècle,” in La lettre et le texte [1987], pp. 273-319 [see pp. 308-309]; and three articles by David J. Shaw: “Early Parisian Editions of the Works of Coquillart,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1976, pp. 213-217 [see pp. 215-216]; “Use of Printed Quire and Sheet Letters in Sixteenth-Century France,” Library, 6th ser., 17 [1995], 311-320; and “Quire Numbers in Books Printed by Antoine Assourd,” Library, 6th ser., 20 [1998], 364-366.) Figures of yet another kind that accidentally survive in the Dent edition of Conrad's The Rescue (in the lower right corner of a fourth of the pages) are imposition figures identifying plate gangs (units of four pages cast together); see Matthew J. Bruccoli and Charles A. Rheault, Jr., “Imposition Figures and Plate Gangs in The Rescue, ” SB, 14 (1961), 258-262. 59 See R. H. Griffith, Alexander Pope: A Bibliography, 1 (1922): 155; 2 (1927): 362; and F. B. Kaye's edition of Bernard Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees (1924), 2: 394-395 (cf. McKerrow's review in Library, 4th ser., 6 [1925-26], 110). R. W. Chapman, in “Printing with Figures,” Library, 4th ser., 3 (1922-23), 175-176, was similarly not concerned with the reporting of all figures. 60 Knotts, “Press Numbers as a Bibliographical Tool: A Study of Gay's The Beggar's Opera, 1728,” Harvard Library Bulletin, 3 (1949), 198-212; Todd, Procedures for Determining the Identity and Order of Certain Eighteenth-Century Editions (University of Chicago dissertation, 1949), pp. 6-38. Todd concluded, near the end of his discussion of figures, that “they should become a part of the bibliographical record” (p. 38). 61 For an extensive listing of articles on press figures, grouped according to the stand they take on these questions, see footnotes 10 and 11 of my “Press Figures in America: Some Preliminary Observations,” SB, 19 (1966), 123-160; a more recent chronological list is in my syllabus (see note 3 above), pp. 191-192. 62 The latter point was made by Todd in his dissertation (see note 60 above), p. 10, and others since then have commented on the possible correlation between imposition and pressmen's choices of locations for figures: see, for example, Povey's “A Century of Press Figures” (see note 33 above), pp. 254-256, and my “Press Figures and the Cut-Off in Duodecimo,” Gutenberg Jahrbuch, 1966, pp. 242-246 (which also discusses the conceivable use of figures to shed some light on the physical arrangement of a shop). For a balanced treatment of the “impediments to the interpretation of press figures” and their potential usefulness when approached cautiously, see B. J. McMullin, “Further Observations on the Incidence and Interpretation of Press Figures,” in Writers, Books, and Trade, ed. O M Brack, Jr. (1994), pp. 177-200. 63 In “Eighteenth-Century Press Numbers: Their Use and Usefulness,” Library, 5th ser., 4 (1950), 249-261. 64 “Observations on the Incidence and Interpretation of Press Figures,” SB, 3 (1950-51), 171-205; “Press Figures and Book Reviews as Determinants of Priority,” PBSA, 45 (1951), 72-76; “Bibliography and the Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century,” SB, 4 (1951-52), 41-55; “Concurrent Printing: An Analysis of Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands, ” PBSA, 46 (1952), 45-57; “Patterns in Press Figures: A Study of Lyttelton's Dialogues of the Dead, ” SB, 8 (1956), 230-235. 65 In A Bibliography of Edmund Burke (1964), Todd sometimes uses tables giving the page numbers and press figures in vertical columns for several editions of one work (as on pp. 41-42) or for several works (pp. 62-65); these are more convenient for reference than the formidable solid blocks of figures in paragraph style (as on pp. 238-239) and in addition provide the signature letters in the left-hand column. In Todd and Ann Bowden's Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History 1796-1832 (1998), long solid paragraphs of figures are again used but with signature letters attached to the page numbers, as in “T146- 3”; and commentary on the figures is occasionally provided, as in the table on p. 114 summarizing each pressman's assignments in the octavo and quarto impressions of the same edition. 66 “Variants in Johnson's Dictionary, 1755,” Book Collector, 14 (1965), 212-213. Two variations of Todd's basic notation omit the dash between the page and the figure. J. C. T. Oates runs the signature letters horizontally across the top of his chart, and for each copy of a book (horizontal lines) enters the leaf reference and figure, as “4a7” or “2b8”; see “Notes on the Bibliography of Sterne,” Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 2 (1954-58), 155-169 (see p. 161). Norma Russell, in A Bibliography of William Cowper to 1837 (1963), prints the record in paragraph form and so must include the signature letter, as “B2 v 10” or “P7 v 3”; but since she follows the unfortunate practice of letting rectos be inferred when versos are not specified, awkward spaces (no more economical than a superscript “r”) result in such notations as “H6 11,” especially when both formes of a sheet are figured and the signature is not repeated (as “F5 4, 8 5”). For item 84 (p. 64) she uses the basically different system of grouping according to figure (“6 on A3 v B11 v C12 D5 v , etc., and 7 on C12 v ”). 67 “The Recording of Press Figures,” Library, 5th ser., 21 (1966), 318-325—from which I have adapted several paragraphs for use in the present discussion. 68 When the figures do not always appear in about the same locations on the pages, one could use oblique lines in the table for separating figures that appear in the left half from those that appear in the right half of the direction line. In this example the size of the figures has been ignored, but obviously separate rows could be made for 2 and *2, 4 and *4, and so forth. When it is known that half-sheets were produced by the method in which two half-sheets were worked together, the half-sheet section of the table could distinguish inner and outer formes; but it should remain a separate section and not be merged with the full-sheet section, since the figures would not be comparable (an unfigured half-sheet gathering may not have been printed from unfigured formes, for a figure may have been placed in the other end of one or both formes). 69 There are many summary tables in “Press Figures in America: Some Preliminary Observations” (see note 61 above); and some sequence tables as well appear in “Press Figures in America: The Shop of Thomas Dobson,” in Writers, Books, and Trade (see note 62 above), pp. 201-220. 70 “Concealed Printings in Hawthorne,” PBSA, 57 (1963), 42-49. 71 “Register Measurement as a Method of Detecting Hidden Printings,” PBSA, 73 (1979), 484-488. 72 Paul Needham has suggested that Gutenberg may have conceived the idea of casting two-line units of movable type into solid slugs. See “Johann Gutenberg and the Catholicon Press,” PBSA, 76 (1982), 395-456 (esp. pp. 429-432), and “Slipped Lines in the Mainz Catholicon: A Second Opinion” (see note 31 above); see also my comments in “Printing History and Other History,” SB, 48 (1995), 269-289 (pp. 284-285), reprinted in Literature and Artifacts (1998), pp. 307-327 (pp. 322-323), and the references cited there to the literature of the controversy surrounding this idea. 73 Such clues should be used even if there is a printer's imprint, since such imprints are frequently ambiguous (as when a printer is identified as “printer and stereotyper”) and since one should in any case try to test every production statement that appears in a book. 74 Shillingsburg, “Detecting the Use of Stereotype Plates,” Editorial Quarterly, 1.1 (1975), 2-3; Winship, “Printing with Plates in the Nineteenth Century United States,” Printing History, 10 (1983), 15-26 (see “Recognizing Books Printed from Plates,” pp. 22-23). Gaskell's chapter on “Plates” in A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972) is on pp. 201-206. 75 Or even lines containing missing letters: a type that drops out allows other types to shift, but if the absence of a letter is caused by plate damage the other letters do not shift. 76 They cannot generally be distinguished by reference to the categories of clues given above, which can show up in plates of all kinds. In photolithographic plates, for example, textual alterations are sometimes misaligned and have a lighter or darker appearance than the surrounding text. 77 “Offset Slur as Bibliographical Evidence,” PBSA, 70 (1976), 538-541.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">UNCHARACTERIZABLE ENTITIES: THE POETICS OF MIDDLE ENGLISH SCRIBAL CULTURE AND THE DEFINITIVE PIERS PLOWMAN by Andrew Galloway</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Russell and George Kane's edition of the Athlone C text of Piers Plowman is available at last, and not only is it prefaced by nearly as long and provocative an introduction as Kane and E. T. Donaldson's controversial Athlone B edition, it has also been accompanied, in the same or recent years, by the completion of several other related projects on Piers Plowman and Middle English textual scholarship, including Kane and Janet Cowen's edition of Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, applying to Chaucer the principles of the Athlone Piers Plowman; Ralph Hanna's Pursuing History, whose longest (and only wholly new) essay investigates the question of how we are to conceive of the “versions” of Piers; and, just preceding Russell and Kane's C edition (and one presumes they did not hold off going to press until he had committed himself to his own C-text readings, although given his prior dependence on Kane and Donaldson's B text, the suspicion is hard to allay), A. V. C. Schmidt's parallel-text edition of the A, B, C and Z versions of Piers Plowman. For all of their intricate massiveness as studies and editions of specific texts, these works cumulatively present, contribute to, or complete projects presenting the most important demonstrations or provocations in the second half of the twentieth century for evaluating and characterizing the evidence of Middle English authorship and late-medieval scribal culture, in the center of which, not by coincidence, is the similarly long-term medieval textual endeavor that we now consider, almost without a pause, “Langland's poem.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The appearance of these projects and studies thus allows some conspectus of complex materials and circumstances and some assessment of extraordinary labors in textual criticism, even in a field that is merely a “small farmyard attached to the great formal gardens of classical, biblical, and Shakespearian editing,” as Derek Pearsall has modestly described Middle English textual scholarship in a valuable survey of its trends. 1 Particularly in the Piers Plowman corner of the farmyard, the most significant gains in textual scholarship have come from exploring jointly or in some fashion as a continuum au- thorial and scribal textual production, even though this poem is almost universally acknowledged to be, at some primary stage or stages, that of a remarkable individual writer. Because of the latter circumstance, such studies indeed cannot be annexed to exciting recent work in its more august neighbor, New Testament textual scholarship, where pursuit of an original text is so radically quixotic that it has lead to appreciation of the whole tradition of transmission as a “living text” bespeaking the “community of the Spirit,” but yielding no single, authoritative reconstruction of an original. 2 Yet Middle English and especially Piers Plowman textual studies have their own crises of origins and authorial inspiration, if less heralded and less momentous, and in the projects I have mentioned the arguments for and materials of these humbler crises now more than ever lie at hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Because the Athlone editors' overt commitment to tracing a portrait of the author and his distinctive poetic style is the guiding principle of their series, it is ironic that the greatest achievement of the instigator and now completer of the long project has been to make the distinctions between the poem and its copyists more difficult than ever—or at least to grant that difficulty the fullest attention of any editorial project on a major Middle English work. I admit that to show more fully what I take to be the larger value of the Athlone C text for Piers Plowman and Middle English textual studies is to offer a “defense” for its labors that its editors might well wish to do without. For one thing, I do not dispute that criticisms mounted against the Athlone editions over the years, most acutely by Charlotte Brewer and Robert Adams, are applicable in new forms to the Athlone C text: the chief objection is that decisions of past editions are supported by increasingly elaborate rationalizations, even when the original judgments no longer appear well-founded. 3 But I wish to emphasize the value of the results. For Kane's previous arguments and editions combine with the complex and sometimes contradictory schemes by which Athlone C characterizes the evidence and the author in such a way that the reader is continually forced to test the categories of such characterization, a process yielding rewards far beyond the Athlone forays of reasoning, brilliant or implausible as they may be. For better and worse, and in contradiction to their stated achievement of distinguishing the author's ipsissima verba, the Athlone editions sustain constantly the difficulty of this poem as a textual product, from which we can productively disengage neither the entity of the author nor the multiple entities of scribal culture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Schmidt's commentary is still to come, his more consistent and far more readily usable text now available does not impose the same burden. For that and other reasons, it is a formidable competitor to Russell-Kane as a standard scholarly edition. Indeed, Schmidt's notion of a “standard edition” is what literary critics and advanced students have a right to expect. Schmidt's text is an expensive but, considering its scope, not prohibitively costly parallel text edition, critically edited including a claim to a full conspectus of the manuscripts; Schmidt's simple display omits a great deal but also increases the edition's usefulness. Schmidt, not Kane, has finally fulfilled R. W. Chambers' 1935 plan for what became the Athlone series: to produce a parallel, critical text of the poem to replace Skeat's. In contrast, the text of the Athlone volumes, access to which is guarded by massive introductions and apparatus and a blizzard of brackets and other signs of manipulation of the copy-text, have appeared with increasingly longer delays, in separate, non-cross-indexed —indeed, non-indexed—volumes. They are notable for subtle efforts to account for the full range of textual evidence in relation to a complex, developing theory of Langland's own textual production, an authorial style which the Athlone editions have been at pains to distinguish from scribal modes, often enough conjecturing authorial readings that exist nowhere in the documentary sources. In contrast, almost all the readings presented in Schmidt's text appear somewhere in the documents (if in partial forms that have never before provably existed in the splicings he presents), a posture of triumphant conservatism that Schmidt has recently adopted in repudiation of his earlier dependence on the most controversial Athlone volume, the edition of B by Kane and Donaldson. And Schmidt is willing to show clearly when he has drawn a reading from another version, while the Athlone editors have always buried such information in dense, small-point lists in introductions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For comparative work with the versions of Piers Plowman, Schmidt's edition deserves to hold the field as long as Skeat's 1886 edition did—for nearly a century. And although the conveniences of Schmidt's texts of Piers Plowman may seem so many tacit criticisms of the cumbersome features of the Athlone texts, Schmidt's generous comments on the pioneering importance of those editions softens such implications. Indeed, the differences between the Athlone texts and Schmidt's are in part the result of the more than forty years that the Athlone project has spanned, as opposed to the concentrated labor of Schmidt's Parallel Text Edition; in greater part they are the result of Schmidt's ambitions for accessibility and a wide educational market, and, as his literary criticism of the poem shows, for an elevation of Langland into the canonicity of a great literary talent (see The Clerkly Maker ). More admirable still, Schmidt is able to free himself from past editorial assumptions, including his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nonetheless, the subtle limitations of Schmidt's easily readable, accurately transcribed, and reassuringly empirically based texts of Piers Plowman ought not be ignored, since being accessible in modern, mass-educational terms may easily distort the fluid, inchoate nature of late-medieval vernacular literary authority, hiding the possibilities that on occasion no manuscript reading may present what the author wrote and that no one version exists as a finished, literary object. Both issues are made clear by the other recent Middle English studies and editions under consideration here, which show the sorts of difficulties that scholarship on Piers Plowman and other Middle English works should continue to attend to in order fully to appreciate Middle English poetics—even when the stated reasons in these works for such involvement sometimes contradict the results.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The reasons are, however, stated at unusual length in all these projects, and with obvious efforts at methodological definitiveness. Along with the first complete collation of the manuscript evidence of The Legend of Good Women, for example, Cowen and Kane present a textbook of the editing theories that Kane has elaborated through a life's work on Piers Plowman. Such theories can be summed up as means to isolate the “distinctive personality” of the author from the “banalities of scribal variation,” as Kane puts it in his terse manifesto at the opening of the new C text (iii), but also as oblique entries into late-medieval scribal culture itself. As with the Athlone editions, the basis for Cowen-Kane is the rejection of the view that the many extant manuscripts can ever be assessed in their totality as “inferior” or “superior,” or securely arranged in a genetic relationship. Instead, like the Athlone editors, Cowen and Kane focus on defining categories of scribal error (now numbering some forty) and the determinate principles of the author's meter (they list some fourteen governing Chaucer's final - e ), in order to inform an otherwise free editorial judgment at every reading of all the manuscripts, venturing to classify the manuscripts themselves in a historical relationship (on the basis of persistent and exclusive shared variation or error) only after defining by these principles what should be taken as scribal variation, and thus creating a text that depends at every moment on editorial judgment rather than any overall assumptions about the particular value of whole manuscripts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is worth recalling that eclectic editions on this basis still thrive at all in Middle English thanks largely to Kane's 1960 edition of the A text of Piers Plowman, even though Kane there applied his own principles fairly conservatively. Kane adopted from Old French and classical textual scholars the strictures against using shared errors to reconstruct a lost archetype by preparing a branching stemma of existing manuscripts. Such a recension, as Kane early noted, requires first a conception of what an “error” is, a notion whose subjectivity vitiates any claims that constructing stemmata on these grounds can be an objective means to reconstructing the ancestor of all extant witnesses. It should be added that such attacks on recension were origi- nally generated because of recension's earliest practioners' claims for scientific objectivity. A modern rather than a nineteenth-century recensionist might reply that since any method involves internal assessment of error, the use of a genealogy may still provide some use in establishing a text, provided it is not followed slavishly. But Kane, editing A, felt that the proportion of nongenetic shared variation was so high as to rule out recension altogether as a means to establish the text: some genetic dyads and triads could be identified with reasonable probability, but the larger genetic groupings that would reconstruct the archetype of all existing manuscripts were simply not ascertainable. In a brilliant sustained essay against Knott and Fowler's competing, stemmatic edition of A, Kane's careful and skeptical genetic conclusions in his 1960 introduction stopped with the presentation of seven groupings of the seventeen-plus A manuscripts: two large groups, two small, and three independent manuscripts. The circumstance was further complicated by such severe contradiction between these groups that only shifting archetypes and massive coincident variation could account for it. Stunningly, Kane found “not a single instance of these manuscripts agreeing in the same, clearly unoriginal variant, or in unoriginal variants demonstrably related” (104).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The B text showed another situation, the controversial solution to which in 1975 led the Athlone series down its path toward Cowen-Kane and, almost simultaneously, Russell-Kane. B's stemma could be traced back fairly clearly to two archetypes, but both were deemed pervasively corrupt. One whole branch of this stemma is represented by only two manuscripts, called R and F, which were full of such intriguing differences from the other branch that increasing numbers of scholars, including Hanna, consider the possibility that these represent a separate stage of the poem. But by applying with a new aggressiveness the notions of scribal error that Kane first began elaborating with A, Kane-Donaldson declared that the differences between the majority archetype and the readings of R and F were due to scribal changes in both groups: these groups simply represented two original witnesses to a single, also corrupt copy of the author's manuscript. Those “corrupt” readings found in this reconstructed B and in C but not in A could, of course, present either the author's revision of A, or a scribal error in the archetype of A not made in those of B and C. But the poet's further alteration in C of many of the unique archetype B readings, sometimes roughly returning to what is found in A, plus what Kane and Donaldson judged a scribal appearance of many of the other readings that were left unchanged in C, suggested to the B editors that the C poet inherited a text with many of these scribal variations, some of which he tried to correct back into something more closely resembling the original.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This circumstance of pervasive scribal corruption in B, and in the B text used by the poet for C, allowed Kane and Donaldson to emend the archetype for B very considerably in order to reconstruct the author's original B, even if its readings were found nowhere in the evidence—and, of course, simultaneously to define the “errors” of the vulgate B text whose further transformations in C, they thought, showed the C-text poet's superior aesthetic tastes when confronted by scribal poetic efforts: the C-poet's changes show that he was “offended” by these passages (Kane-Donaldson 105), filled with “dissatisfaction” with them (108), finding them “objectionable” (108) and frequently “correcting” (109) or at least “firmly” responding to them (110). A lingering problem was that C still left many such archetypal B readings where Kane and Donaldson could “confidently identify scribal corruption” (111), and even including more, such as doubled lines, where new C passages were inserted into B. These last points, the aesthetic gaffes of the C text, are where the story of the Athlone C edition begins. In essays over the years, Russell has increasingly suggested that C was left incomplete and only finally assembled by a second individual, Langland's first editor, whom they here propose was “a sort of literary executor” (Russell-Kane 83n28). And almost simultaneously, the discriminations involved in such judgments are what Cowen-Kane involves, since with Chaucer's work too the question is distinguishing scribal variation and textual participation from authorial revision, a distinction that, according to the methods Kane pioneered, must be made reading-by-reading rather than manuscript by manuscript—even when, as with Chaucer's Prologue to the Legend, the authorial revision is witnessed by only one manuscript.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is no coincidence that Walter W. Skeat was the first to edit Chaucer's Legend of Good Women (1889) as a two-version work in a parallel format, since Skeat had established such a format with the 1886 Parallel Text Edition of Piers Plowman, which he was the first editor to declare existed in three authorial versions. (The argument about The Legend of Good Women had been made in scattered footnotes in Arthur Gilman's edition of 1879, and perhaps this sparked Skeat's thinking about both Chaucer and Langland's works [see Skeat, Legend xliv].) The concept of presenting parallel editions for both Langland's and Chaucer's “revised” works started with Skeat's involvement in the Early English Text Society's published parallel-text manuscript transcriptions of the works of Chaucer and Langland; and it is clear that Skeat was far more tied to what the manuscripts of the works grossly presented than to hypotheses of what authorial text lay distantly behind such witnesses. In fact on the basis of gross manuscript evidence, Skeat called two additional states of Piers “versions” even though he accepted that these were not authorial: the first conjoins A's short text with C's long conclusion, the second combines B and C texts (actually only one manuscript that he knew of presented this “version,” Bodley 814 [=“Bo”], and it presents a hybrid AC Prologue followed by a B text [Skeat, Piers i, xxv-xxvi; cp. Kane- Donaldson 2]). Thus Skeat categorized manuscripts into “groups” or “classes” on the basis of specific readings (in the case of the Legend a single name, “Ouyde” or “Guydo,” in line 1396), and within these groups as “inferior” or “superior” on the basis of kind and pervasiveness of variation. By contrast, the Athlone editors developed a taxonomy of scribal variation as a way to hypothesize the author's always-lost original. Yet in spite of these differences in philosophy and method, Kane and the Athlone editors have never come to different conclusions from Skeat's claims about the authorial origins of these works' versions or the number of those versions. At the time of the A text edition, there were polemical reasons to follow Skeat's profile of the author and his unified progress (the alternative seemed to be the crowd of authors that Manly conjured for the poem). As the Athlone series comes to completion, its editors' assumption seems to have hardened into defense of a portrait of the author against “any post-structuralist reduction” (Russell-Kane iii)— presumably into a mere Foucauldian convenience without any coherent or developing intention (even though in fact the attacks on three discrete versions have come from sources vigorously rehabilitating the author's calculation and intention). 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of a piece with this continuity with Skeat's Middle English portraiture is Cowen-Kane's re-establishment of Skeat's view that the radically different form of the Prologue of the Legend found in Cambridge University Library MS Gg.4.27 is an authorial revision. But Cowen-Kane use far more rigorous principles to establish this hypothesis than Skeat and pursue its implications far more boldly. For the question in their endeavor is to decide just how much of the unique copy of “Prologue II” (G) is to be accepted as at least a blurred witness to authorial changes; how much to be taken as a better witness than any other manuscript to what originally existed in both “Prologue I” (F) and “Prologue II” (that is, lost original readings rather than authorial revisions); and how much totally rejected as the “banalities of scribal variation.” What may best be called Kane's “profile textual criticism” comes into play, a strategy of characterizing scribal consciousness that at times approaches a kind of antiheroic Middle English literary history. Thus Cowen-Kane go to elaborate lengths to profile the Gg.4.27 scribe (he is “relatively careful” but “dull,” as shown by his signs of struggling to puzzle out the meaning of the verse) while they strive to recreate a revised authorial text prior to that scribe's unique witness to this text, as well as readings lost by scribal error or simplification from all the manuscripts of Prologue I. Yet they emphasize that, as Greg's theory of copy text dictates, what they print at all points is not fully authorial but merely “represents authentically what run-of-the-mill fifteenth century scribes made of, did to, Chaucer's language” (Cowen-Kane 149). The text presented is still only the hypothetical trace, not the presence of the author's text. As always in Athlone editions, the constant bracketing of insertions and changes (but as in the Athlone texts never marking deletions from the copy text) further reminds the reader at every stumble of the eye how far such a text, any text, is from what the Middle English poet wrote, hence how extensive the need for the editors to emend it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In practice, the heavily emended text Cowen-Kane print is notable for how often it takes small readings of G to present not evidence of authorial revision but, instead, as evidence of the correct reading behind the flawed archetype of the first version of the Prologue; thus both texts they print begin, “A thousand sithes I haue herd men tell...,” even though only G preserves the reading “sithes” (instead of the “tymes” of all the other manuscripts, which Chaucerians will be more familiar with as the first line of the “F” version). In turn, Cowen and Kane often use the other manuscripts to correct Prologue II—whose distinctive features, of course, exist in only one manuscript—where their principles of scribal variation explain the differences better than authorial revision. Naturally enough, in at least one instance of such peeling of hypothetical textual layers the two editors cannot agree about the distinction between scribal and authorial variation. They present their disagreement publicly in one instance, Prol. I, 118, Prol. II, 225, conservatively allowing the peculiar G reading to be printed as the text of Prol. II. But surely Kane is right that a scribe, not Chaucer, changed F's remarkable reading “Vpon the smale softe swote gras” to G's blander “Vpon the softe sote grene gras.” Cowen balks, and prevails: a bit of reverence must always, perhaps, adhere to the solitary witness we have to Chaucer's revised version. But it is the consequence of working through Kane's bold editorial scholarship that such reverence for empirical evidence—even the plausible reading of a text that is proposed as the sole witness to authorial revision— begins to seem mere superstition. Why shouldn't Kane's logic of scribal habits be applied here too? Unfortunately, to change evidence on such bases may be a slippery slope, leading to the sorts of wholesale and often less supportable emendations of the Kane-Donaldson B text. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For editors of Chaucer's Legend, the ultimate test of conviction that Gg.4.27 really does represent an authorial revision is to reject everything about that manuscript that appears more likely to fit the profile of its dull, careful scribe. This leads, of course, to the awkwardness and extravagance— or sign of relentless commitment to principles—of printing parts of the first Prologue twice, the second time in place of Gg.4.27's unique variation, dismissed to its own critical apparatus. Cowen and Kane pass the biggest test of nerve by printing at Prol. II, 127-138 precisely what the other manuscripts (Prol. I) read for the “fowls' song” at 139-152, rejecting on the basis of a complex explanation of hypotheses of mental errors and compensations any attempt (such as Skeat's and the Riverside Chaucer 's) to claim for G's hodgepodge here some authorial revision, or to patch it into some grammatical and metrical form. The same level of intricate reasoning allows inserting in Prol. I what no text prints, such as the brilliant emendation at 815, when Thisbe is “ek forgladde that she was escaped,” where the unusual participial adjective (forgladden, i.e. `begladded') is preserved only as indirect traces (“ffor gladde,” “so glad”) which are not explicable on the grounds of variation from the majority reading printed by all other editors, “so glad.” Other notably ingenious emendations appear (e.g., 2508, 2522-23, and 2676).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such salutary resistance to treating as sacred an individual manuscript and its scribe allows Cowen and Kane, and still more Kane and his Athlone co-editors, not just to edit texts but to depict sharply, if mostly quite pejoratively, the nature of scribal culture in late medieval England. Because Kane is so unenamored of the “banalities of scribal variation,” his and his co-editors' portraits of scribal activity are all the more powerful and memorable. The consequent portrait gallery of scribal culture is what theorists of historical writing such as Hayden White would call `history in the ironic mode' —what is perceived so clearly because of what it is not. Thus the direct corollary of such transient, “ironic” profiles would be a full-blown exploration of scribal agency and circumstance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna's collection of essays directly undertakes this exploration, and makes a crucial complement to Kane's and his co-editors' editions and textual criticism even while Hanna critiques many of their assumptions. The bases for the new essay on Langland's modes of production lie in all the other essays, so their claims require some comment. Hanna's opening essays on booklet manuscripts, especially those constructed for Lollard readers, for example, instance his ability to elucidate with necromantic skill both the probable archetypes of existing manuscripts and the traces of original social meanings and social uses of manuscripts. Here he reconstructs both the booklet manuscripts' original physical forms and exemplars, and the social and religious uses implies by these forms—Lollard circulation of separate tracts, non-Lollard lay religious materials gathered in provincial centers of manuscript production, for example—located against broader sweeps of social history, such as the population movements that culminated in such works being collected in London, where the diverse dialects of the booklets can most readily be conceived to converge. Such studies are important because they read manuscripts as having shifting social uses, displaying a succession of temporally defined—and superseded—“agencies.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Hanna broaches the very difficult issue of differentiating properties of agency in manuscripts and, in effect, of intention (although he rarely uses the word, it is usually what he means by the more fashionable “agency”). In the case of manuscript booklets, he specifies two kinds of agency—one embodied in manuscripts assembled by a book vendor or owner, to whom the book or booklet would be a found object, a given unit any further changes to which would exceed the intention of the original scribe; the other in manuscripts intended by the book producer to be sub-units, designed to be “joined with other booklets in the same or a similar format” (23). The potential of reading manuscripts as precisely differentiable layers of multiple intention has important significance for unfolding the social world embodied in manuscripts. Ultimately, it points toward the tricky issue of who should be credited with the layers of revision in a poem like Piers Plowman, where scribal variation clearly intervenes between the author's revisions, and where the question thus constantly intrudes of how much of such scribal participation should be granted the sanction of authorial “intention” when it persists in a revised version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna's differentiation of intentions (or “agencies”) in the case of booklet- manuscripts, however, is hard to sustain rigorously, and this shows the difficulties of any effort to carry out such a fine differentiation. For if he distinguishes manuscripts made of booklets into those that were “conceived and produced as single volumes” versus those that “reflect the eclectic tastes of an owner” (23), he also collapses that distinction by positing that those that were “conceived and produced as single volumes” were in fact conceived as small units of texts to be assembled into large codices according to the tastes of the purchaser: “Booklets... provided a useful way of building up such large codices out of a series of small sections—a procedure that may have been useful in terms both of marketing and of flexibly planning production” (23). Thus considering booklet-manuscripts in terms of the intention of “producers” turns out to merge with considering them from the point of view of the “vendors or owner.” Nor could this problem be settled were Hanna's novel proposal to produce critical editions of booklet-manuscripts realized (47). The differentiation Hanna had suggested could never be actually made, since the final, “definitive” shape of the codex would be the vendor's or owner's, but the booklets which were designed for such ad hoc assembly would carry with them the general intention of such further assembly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fact, Hanna is more successful when arguing for a delineated uncertainty of individual intention in the relation between a text maker, his patron, and the text's subsequent owner. This is acutely hypothesized, for example, in his subsequent discussions of John Trevisa's massive prose translations and their subsequent medieval editions, and most effectively when Hanna considers not just Trevisa's text in relation to Trevisa's own patron, Thomas Berkeley IV, and his London network of distribution, but also when he turns to a second main textual tradition, where a later scribe's patron sought to present Trevisa's works in a specific Trevisa canon, one that frames the textual initiative by Trevisa's patron (as Trevisa does himself) in order to reveal the same theme, with later topical meaning, of a literary laborer's exemplary obedience to a “patronal order” (71). Such canny explication of a very careful medieval edition accomplishes a great deal: first, it shows how even a remarkably accurate text is faithful to the original for its own, socially implicated reasons; second, it suggests that such a social meaning behind an accurate witness could never be conveyed in a critical apparatus alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed, Hanna's most epitomizing and suggestive dictum is “A manuscript work is at any given moment always socially single”—and what is “single” here for medieval manuscript agency is not an individual human being, the writer or scribe, but rather a single horizon of immediate interaction encompassing the work, the patron and the producer. The ideal object of editions is to recover a text's “public constituency” (74) that will fuse these individual agencies into a social Gestalt, an end accomplished only by “greater access to `the evidence' than standard formats based on collation forms derived from print books allows.” For only by this means can be appreciated how all manuscripts are “every bit as mediated in their own differing ways as the standard modern edition, each historically situated and incapable of being understood outside that situation” (75).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna's long essay on the versions of Piers Plowman attempts to apply to the stages of Piers the notion of such “socially single” horizons which in- clude not a patron but the scribal culture the author relied on, and the social pressures he responded to. Since A, as Kane's edition demonstrated, has no clear genetic stemma beyond seven separate groups, Hanna proposes that seven scribes had separate access to a version of the poem in its first, short draft; the regional dialects of the seven archetypes indicate a situation of London as the meeting point for provincial scribes who each took a copy back to their own areas. This represents a stage of the poem where the author did not control access to it—whether because the scribes made their copies after he had died, or because the poet no longer cared about his first draft of his poem. The two groups of B manuscripts Kane-Donaldson defined as witnesses to two archetypes suggest to Hanna a different situation: the large group witnesses (with some omissions and many other errors) Langland's only delibrately published version of the poem, while the two manuscripts R and F, representing the second tradition, contain evidence of sets of lines the poet inserted later, on the way to producing the C text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Almost simultaneously with Hanna's work, the argument for a second B tradition in RF was closely argued by other scholars (see Taylor; Justice 5-9); Brewer had generally proposed it in 1991, in part following Donaldson himself in a view repudiated in the Kane-Donaldson edition. 6 The sudden dominance of this claim now has perhaps been overdetermined, by, on the one hand, doubts in many quarters about the Kane-Donaldson emphasis on a single, perfected, but profoundly scribally marred B text, and on the other hand, by a current interest in fuller historical literary inquiry further fragmenting such claims of authorial stasis. Once set forth, the hypothesis finds abundant confirmation and appears likely to constitute a permanent change to the paradigm that Langland scholarship for another period will generally accept. Working through Kane-Donaldson's list of the differences between the main B tradition and RF (66-67) has only convinced me further: in tandem with the other evidence of C's further attention to the topics (generally poverty and labor) of these passages, I consider at least 20 of these RF-only sections much more likely to be further poetic insertions than the kinds of eyeskip in the single common ancestor that Kane-Donaldson claim. (Some cases of omitting or including brief, syntactically self-sufficient passages, however, might be due to eyeskip from paraph to paraph in either of the archetypes—a principle Kane does not list.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course, it might seem that if this claim is so easily shattered, then one must question and `reenact' (as Kane-Donaldson actually challenge us to do [220]) every instance the Athlone editors present of distinctively scribal errors rather than authorial changes; but in fact such questioning of their conclusions has not been so pervasive. The debate over the scribal or authorial “Z text” of Piers Plowman is the only significant ongoing instance. No one has followed Charlotte Brewer's provocative question, for example, of how we can not prove that the A text appeared in even more minorly revised authorial forms. 7 Of course, the case for an authorial post-B ancestor to RF has a much simpler basis than that for various A texts slightly modified by the author, or even than that for an authorial ancestor to the short Z as a pre-A text. Whatever the Z text is, it can at least be printed, however its evidence is characterized. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna's characterizations of the poet's production allows some proliferation of versions, but not an indeterminate number. Z is an extravagantly scribal version drawing from all three versions, made after the poet's death. The poet's own development proceeded as follows: the B text's careful, line-by-line reworking of A, so different from the RF and the C stages of revisions that primarily involve large-scale insertions and relocations, indicates two different kinds of attention to the text—not “authorial” versus “non-authorial,” but different kinds of authorial intention. Hanna's distinctions here resemble what Hershel Parker has argued about revisions of American fiction, when preexisting chunks are not reworked in detail and are left as vestiges of previous textual intentions that collide with new, often less meticulously integrated layers of material. In the case of Piers, this helps explain how the B text was the poet's only meticulously thorough revision, while RF and C were much more topically specific productions responding to more specific, and in part externally generated pressures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Hanna's view, an initial scribal copy of B (possibly a fair copy) was made when Langland first released this version for publication by transmitting it to a scribe—and from this fair copy (with its scribal variations) descends the archetype (with further variations) of the largest group of extant B manuscripts. In RF and C, the poet clarified the text on topics that the rebels in 1381 had rallied around, separating his inward-turning conclusions from their revolutionary goals, while also agreeing with them on certain social points, especially “the need for a pious and [socially] corrective clergy, not a clergy of lord's servants” (243). Thus after Langland inserted the RF passages in his original manuscript, he sent this to have the new passages inserted or interleaved into the fair copy, in order to have the work published as it had been before—and from this scribally interleaved copy descends the archetype of the RF manuscripts. After thus “publishing” both B and the partly revised B (i.e., the RF tradition), the poet no longer wished or was able to use the original B manuscript, which he had already used once for RF additions; so Langland used the scribal fair copy with the scribal RF insertions as the basis for producing the further revisions of the C text—thus inheriting the scribal variations which that initial fair copy and its later additions had generated, few of which the poet restored in their original form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The possible goals of an edition of “versions” that Hanna defines are, then, themselves multiple but far from innumerable—although even these raise questions about whose intention was being preserved, and how the differences might be treated. The horizons of “complete” intention that an editor could present include A, B, RF, and C (although Hanna avoids the question of how to consider in an edition the scribal variations still in the B copy used for RF; would these be sanctioned once RF was added, requiring both an edition of conjecturally emended B and one of archetypal B plus RF?). Or, Hanna suggests, the entity to present as the only meticulously complete realization of poetic intention could be simply B (although this would lack the readings from RF, even if these improve or correct the text: here, Hanna avoids the issue of B's infelicities, the more casual alliteration than A, and the occasional clumsiness at insertion of new material, the last a point I discuss below). Or the entities to present as authorial horizons of intention could feature A-as-realized-in-B, and then RF-as-realized-in-C; or the entity characterizable as the fulfillment of the author's intentions could feature just C, as the last work, which the poet might have considered complete in some sense (even though it incorporated scribal errors from the B copy, as of course did the RF version of B). His narrative is thus far more attentive to specific social interaction than the Athlone conclusions are, but far from Brewer's more extreme hypothesis that any one of the “versions” may have received occasional alterations by the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fact, a second line of Hanna's inquiry into the versions of Piers Plowman seeks to curtail the number of authorial versions of C. Hanna endeavors to characterize as scribal the two manuscripts that Wendy Scase first considered in tandem as evidence that a second tradition of some passages of C circulated in rough form as attachments to the B text and thus perhaps constituted some of Langland's preliminary forays into the full-scale rewriting that became the C text. These manuscripts, Huntington Library, San Marino, California, MS 114 (=“Ht”) and Ilchester (University of London S.L. MS V.88; =“I”), both present sections of C text that resemble one another more than they resemble any of the other C manuscripts, and both include the same portions of the C revision of the Pardon passus (C.9) and the curious C insertion of Conscience's only partly alliterative speech in the Prologue. In Ilchester this last passage is made to alliterate, but in a form that evidently is an attempt to regularize a text like that found in Ht rather than the rest of the C tradition. The two texts combine these materials from C.9 and the C Prologue in manifestly similar forms, although Ht (a dizzyingly composite manuscript of all three versions) locates them after B.4.153, and I (otherwise a good C manuscript) places them in the Prologue along with sections from the A Prologue—clearly, like all instances of Skeat's “fifth version” of the poem, a copy with a cobbled Prologue to complete a headless exemplar. Scase provocatively suggested that the focus in the new pardon passages against false hermits and “lollards” might have represented a poetic criticism of such figures that was written (“made”) and circulated between the B and C versions, and that the narrator in the full C text looks back on when he states he was</field>
      <field name="fulltext">lytel ylet by, leueth me for sothe, Amonges lollares of londone and lewede Ermytes, For y made of tho men as resoun me tauhte. (5.3-5)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna disputes the claim to an authorial tradition behind the Ilchester / Huntington materials by demonstrating that their archetype must have been a mislineated form of the received edition. Three missing lines from HtI must, he argues, have been due to eyeskip occurring from a þer to þerof appearing at line end in the mislineation. Thus the HtI archetype, far from an authorial version, is a particularly corrupt scribal fragment, plugged into damaged copies of the poem to “complete” them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hanna's solution to the question of the HtI tradition is meant to clear the ground before he proposes his own authorial “version” midway between B and C: the RF revision. But his handling of Scase's argument leaves some nagging questions. For example, Hanna's claim that mislineation produced the eyeskip on þer-þerof in the HtI archetype (Hanna 210- 211) is convincing for only part of his evidence: Ht and I together track the mislineation he has shown from C.Prol.113b-116, but only Ht can be mapped onto such mislineated lines for C.Prol.109-110, while Ilchester appears either to summarize or present inchoately those lines and, it seems to me, in part the lines presumed dropped from the HtI archetype (C.Prol.111-113). For this section, Prol.109-113, Ilchester's evidence seems here to have some closer relation in lineation and content to the main C tradition than to Huntington's evidence, even while Ilchester has closer relations to Huntington for the rest of the shared materials.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here are the readings for these lines (including more than Hanna presents to indicate the repetition of the lines “dropped” from HtI plus the point where Ht and I indeed together suggest a mislineated form of the main C tradition, as Hanna has astutely noticed). I have broken some lines with virgules and indentation to indicate the most plausible points of mislineation: Ht: What mischef &amp; myschaunce fell to þe children of Israel On alle hem þat fre were for too fals prestes For Offines synne alþirfirst and Finees his broþer Betyn were in bataylle and lostyn archa domini And for her owne syre sawe hem do þe synne Suffrid hem to do ylle / chastise hem ne wolde þer he fil for sorow / from a chayer þer he satte Breke his nekkebone in two / &amp; alle for veniaunce... (f. 42 v ) 9 C (lines missing from Ht italicized): What cheste and meschaunce to þe children of Irael Ful on hem þat fre were thorwe two fals prestis! For Offines synne and fines his brother Thei were discomfited in batayle and losten Archa domini And for here syre sey hem synne / and suffred hem do ille And chastisid hem noght þerof / and nolde noght rebuken hem Anon as it was tolde hym that þe children of Irael Were disconfit in batayle and Archa domini lorn And his sones slawe / anon he ful for sorwe Fro his chayere þer he sat / and brake his nekke atwene And al was for vengeance / he bet noght his children... (Russell-Kane Prol.105-115) I (obliterated letters represented with colons): what cheste and mechaunce fel vpon þe children Of Israel þat fre were for tuo false prestes For þe synne of Offyn and Fynees his broþer þat beten were in bataile and losten archa domini and for þair sire soeffrede þe sennes þat þey wrogh::: and chastised not his children of her euel chekkes he stombled doun fro his stool in stede þer he sat and brak his nekke bon in tuo / for so þe book telles... (Russell-Kane 191) As my line breaks indicate, the argument of mislineation and eyeskip can be much more easily granted for Ht than I, which parallels Ht's mislineation only with the final lines. Ilchester's “and for þair sire soeffrede þe sennes þat þey wrogh::: / and chastised not his children of her euel chekkes” seems to point toward C rather than follow Ht's mislineation here; only Ilchester makes reference to “his children,” the point of the exemplum, while Ht lacks both phrases in C that refer to `chastising his children' (110, 115). Yet while C provides the most careful psychological explanation for the reaction by the father, Heli, all three versions make the exemplum's point clear enough. Eyeskip may of course explain the absence of C's three lines (though the repetition of Anon / anon at the beginning and end of the omitted lines seem a more likely way in which eyeskip could have occurred than þer, which actually appears only in Ht). But it is intriguing that the lack of C's 111-113 in both Ht and I separates HtI from the main C tradition precisely where that tradition is extraordinarily repetitive, as well as completely non-alliterative (“Thei were discomfited in batayle and losten Archa domini ... Were disconfit in batayle and Archa domini lorn”). Eyeskip seems to be only one possible explanation: others are active editing or expansion by some agent, either in the C archetype or the HtI archetype or in more than two stages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The difference could, of course, be scribal editing out or eyeskip of repetition in a single archetype of HtI; but how is such gross repetition to be explained in the main C archetype itself? Is it not possible that the archetype of HtI appeared first, as Scase suggests, and that the repeated phrases in the main C tradition in this passage appeared in the course of inserting a version of the HtI materials? As I will show in a moment, such prolix repetitions, whatever their source, are most common where the poet inserted new materials in C and B. And what of Scase's observation that the HtI materials paralleling C.9, in HtI found in the Prologue, lack a long section of strictly B lines carried over into the main C tradition (9.163-187)? In this section (although not in the Prologue section) the HtI materials represent swatches of materials that were here wholly new to C, which, as Scase observed, a scribe is unlikely to have copied by omitting every line carried over in the main tradition from B to C. Hanna suggests that the lack of the B carry-over lines when HtI's archetype transmitted C.9 may have been “a deliberate suppression by the archetypal scribe, reflecting a perceived desire for hermit, not beggar, materials” (214)—that is, it's a matter of coincidence that this “desire” followed the fault line between C and B. But this cannot be the answer. For as Russell-Kane's new ultraviolet-assisted transcription shows, the Ilchester Prologue includes C.9.98 and 9.105ff., which directly concern beggars not hermits (Russell-Kane 186-92). Ht moreover shifts, at the end of its presentation of the C-only insertion on Hophni and Phineas, to other materials altogether (see the summary and transcription in Russell and Nathan 129-130). Scase's point about the absence of B lines in portions of Ht and I remains unanswered, and the difficulties of surmising the respective origins and sequence of, and overall relationship between, Ht, I and the main C tradition cannot be settled unquestionably as scribal mislineation and eyeskip. Once the process of revision—on topical, spiritual, literary and other bases— is itself defined as the primary characteristic of an author, it is difficult to claim any definitive entities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For on some basis the very existence of such an apparently rough version or versions of Conscience's speech must be explained. What sort of poet or poetic process would leave a nonrhyming first draft tacked into the poem? If this passage in the main C tradition is a rough draft, to be later polished up, why is there no evidence anywhere else in C of similarly unalliterative drafts? Did the poet have such trouble with the alliteration here, but everywhere else manage to destroy his first drafts?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The non-alliterative and rather abruptly if not irrelevantly intrusive Hophni and Phineas passage in the Prologue, framed in a speech where Conscience condemns clerics for misleading the laity and thus allowing idolatrous worship but placed amidst the scene of Westminster, constitutes in essence one of the largest problems for the Athlone C editors. For they insist that Langland was (in Hanna's wry phrasing) a deft, Chaucerian poet, “always intent on getting things precisely just so, and taking his poem through three meticulous runs simply to achieve this end” (Hanna 242). To Russell-Kane, not only is the stretch of what would be “prose if so written out” a sign of “the roughest of Langland's drafts” (87), the whole passage on Hophni and Phineas seems not to apply to its local context of satirizing administrative clerics. It constitutes the most “extreme” evidence of what Russell-Kane claim for the entire C text: the work of revising B was radically unfinished, and C was assembled—rather, misassembled—by a later individual. Thus the Athlone project, summarized in Kane's Foreword, of showing how “the distinctive personality of the poet... survives the banalities of scribal variation” and “affords an experience calculated to dismiss any post-structuralist reduction of him as `author'” (iii), is made unattainable from the outset of the C text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Russell-Kane's profile of this later individual, the first editor of C, is rather different from Kane's portraits of other dull scribes producing endless banalities of variation. This figure is motivated by “love and piety or zeal for the message of the poem” (though not, be it noted, for the details of the work's poetic craft as the Athlone editors are), and the clumsiness of his insertions of new material show that he is “not necessarily knowledgeable, however well intentioned and close to the poet” (87). Thus while Kane-Donaldson found the B archetype to be pervasively corrupt at the level of local errors, Russell-Kane find the C archetype to be additionally corrupt at a deeper structural level. They bring to the bar lines in C that are redundant, and they argue these exist in part because cancellations and insertion marks in the dead poet's foul papers were, however piously viewed, grossly misread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But even the poet's own efforts, they note, include readings like those in the Hophni and Phineas section that are marked by “signs of haste” (84), “unresolved indecisions about detail” (84), and a “postponement of attention to poetic form, whether through preoccupation with particular meaning, or a distracting sense of urgency about larger plans and changes” (83). In fact, what this exercise in “profile” textual criticism produces is not simply a distinction between author and scribe, but between an author who is less than his usual careful self and a scribe who is more than his usual dull self. The profiles of the zealous but hasty author and the zealous but clumsy literary executor acutely and non-idealistically define some of the real character of the C text; but by Occam's razor one may question why two figures are presented who seem hard to tell apart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is the profile of the “literary executor” not also plausibly a severe if partial portrait of Langland producing his final version—a more penetrating but not significantly different image from Hanna's view of the author of C? As clear evidence of the hand of the “literary executor,” Russell-Kane mention several instances of “incompleted revisions” (86) and “ensuing confusion on the part of the maker of the first revised copy” (84) which can be identified where “both revised and unrevised forms of a line within the passage” are present (85). They instance Piers' first appearance, C.7.185-193 (cp. B.5.540-549). But the authority of this passage may be preserved in several ways. First, the repetitions in C are almost entirely emphases on how Truth pays his hired helpers by means other than literal money, producing a drumming insistence that demands for fair pay, one of the central issues of fourteenth- century labor laws and rebellions, are only truly met by the metaphorical “pay” that satisfaction of duty yields (just as Conscience's new C-text speech to Meed [C.3.344-406a] elaborates the nature of “right reward”). The repetitions in the revision of the B passage make the pun on “to paye” as `for pleasure' and `for profit' overwhelmingly clear, as do others of the differences from and repetitions of the B text that emphasize metaphorical rather than monetary recompense: Ich haue ybe his foloware al this fourty wynter And yserued treuthe sothly, somdel to paye. In alle kyne craftes þat he couthe deuise Profitable as for þe plouh a potte me to lerne And thow y sey hit mysulf y serue hym to paye; Y haue myn huyre of hym wel and oþerwhiles more. He is þe presteste payere þat eny pore man knoweth ... And if C is to be criticized for repetitions in new passages, so can B. In B, for example, Meed promises to help refurbish her friar-confessor's priory, leading the narrator to break all literary unities and interrupt rather garrulously and repetitiously: Ac god alle good folk swich grauynge defendeþ, To writen in wyndowes of hir wel dedes, An auenture pride be peynted þere and pomp of þe world; For god knoweþ þi conscience and þi kynde wille And þi cost and þi coueitise and who þe catel ouʒte. Forþi lere yow lordes, leueþ swich writynge, To writen in wyndowes of youre wel dedes ... B.3.64-70) The repetition occurs just at a point where B made an insertion into A; to be sure, it is cleaned up in C. But whatever the poet's ultimate or belated efforts to remove repetitions, their presence in B and C suggests a proneness to casualness about allowing repetition, perhaps in order to keep later expansions firmly attached to the original point, perhaps because of a taste for homiletic repetition, perhaps because of a specific technique of making or ordering insertions. At any rate, such repetitions are a tic of the poet whenever he made revisions in any version, not a habit only of a post-mortem devotee. At just the points where B adds new materials to A, one finds several other examples of the sorts of repetitions just cited at B.3.64-79; for example, B.1.114, 121 (expanding A.1.112-114), and B.4.30, 32, 42 (expanding A.4.14-23). So too, B's insertion of Wrath's confession into A's sequence of Sins is connected with an odd transition, announcing that the narrator himself is very quickly confessed (5.185-186); the transition is smoothed to a more logical connection in C (6.168-169). Even in A one finds the poet recollecting his point with repetitions (Prol.91, 95; 2.22-26)—who knows if these represent expansions of still earlier passages. A rather disjunctive C addition to B.18 (C.20.350-358) even returns to the B materials with a frank admission by the poet of his tendency to let second thoughts pull away from the original point: (A litel y ouerleep for lesynges sake, That y ne sygge as y syhe, suynde my teme). We always catch the poet in the process of carrying out his craft, but he never appears as ashamed of being caught in that state of ongoing activity as we are inclined to think he should be. Even Russell-Kane's very modern use of parentheses here registers a kind of editorial embarrassment at work-in-progress that the poet's text nowhere demands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What basis, then, do Russell-Kane's many detailed conjectural emendations possess? On what profile of the writer do they depend? One of many ingenious examples of their work is 5.44, in the midst of the dreamer's moving self- justification: “And so y leue in london and [vp] lond[on] bothe,” where the manuscript readings divide between ”in london and upelond bothe” and “in london and upon/on/by/out of london both.” Russell-Kane's emendation seeks to ascertain direction of variation, to divine what scribes must have been responding to; and the sly, idiomatic reading they construct— in which the narrator admits to living parasitically on (“vp”) London as well as in it—is compelling indeed. At the same time, one might well ask how structurally perfect is the C text insertion of the whole 104-line self-defense at this point in the poem, a passage roughly three times the length of the Hophni and Phineas insertion in the C Prologue. Critical acclamation of the “autobiographical” insertion is widespread and perfectly justifiable. But the kinds of explanations for the placement of this insertion (for example, that the dreamer is “confessing” as the Sins in the following section do) look to thematic parallels and associations and ignore the literal inconsistencies. These principles and this licence could also be applied to explain the insertion of Conscience's speech in the Prologue, where Langland located, at a scene featuring officially employed clerks, Conscience's condemnation of how clerks are not attending to the laity, who are thus left to worship idols while the clergy itself worships the money gained in the king's civil service. The unalliterative form of Conscience's speech (which is not “prose”; it has the right metrical stresses) could be appreciated at a deliberate evocation of the homiletic style, a sermon, Langland inserting yet another genre into his poem in a bold formal experiment. Curiously, when critics treat B, Langland's un smoothed versions of passages find much critical support; one of the reasons B has traditionally been favored over C is its surprise and illogic, which C more often than not edits out. But when C presents new passages, they are not given the same approval as the “disjunctive” or “illogical” passages first appearing in B. In the twentieth century, the C text of Piers Plowman seems destined to bring out the contradictions of our post-Romantic aesthetic ideals, favoring spontaneity and supralogical texts on the one hand, but perfectly constructed transitions and literal continuities on the other. And as always, textual criticism, whether it intends it or not, is at the edge of confrontations between past and present aesthetic ideals and other principles of authority.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even Hanna's distinctions between the attention of the poet carefully revising A to produce B and the poet more architecturally revising for C appear too simplistic. At any point in his career Langland could be meticulous with composition or extraordinarily unconcerned about matters like repetitions; one might venture that this is why his work has both its centripetal progress, its inward absorption, and its constant ability to invite others to feel that they too can add to its idiom and participate in its impulsive spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since there is no officially nominated D text, Russell-Kane are forced to allow in C for something like this range of authorial attention, which Kane-Donaldson could ignore in favor of a single ideal intention, ascertained against C and A as required. Russell-Kane, however, must generate a spectrum of authorial agency in C, at one end of which is “prime Langland, crisp and to the point” (87), at the other, what the poet “sanctioned” of unauthorial readings from the corrupt B text that he used in making C (93-94), or left standing because of “haste” and impending death. Russell-Kane's portrait of the artist as an old man finally allows a complexity and variety in his poetic modes that Kane-Donaldson denied. Thus while Kane-Donaldson emend B's archetype freely to square with their unvarying standard of what the poet originally wrote as B (“prime Langland”), the C poet must be hypothesized at some points at least as potentially accepting the archetypal errors of B that he did not change. Russell-Kane weaken and finally abandon the category of such “sanctioned errors” in the case of the final three passūs, the last two of which they decide to treat as having only “unsanctioned” errors, because the passūs show no clear signs that the poet changed them at all. Since his eye was never cast over them, these passūs may be changed to accord exactly with the heavily emended B edition, where the text at least represents the editors' judgment of what Langland wrote earlier rather than what he simply held in his hand later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But in the antepenultimate passus the argument of “sanctioning” is difficult to sustain rigorously. The passus (C.20, B.18) is slightly expanded, but most sections appear hardly touched. What to do here? In Russell-Kane, C.20 is sometimes treated as having sanctioned archetypal errors—or, more likely, readings just as plausible as those that Kane-Donaldson printed for B.18 and also found in the B tradition, which Kane-Donaldson emended away but which Russell-Kane now retain (e.g., 20.14 “Auntres” vs. B.18.16 “Auentrous”; 20.51 “Thei nayled hym” vs. B.18.51 “Nailed hym”). Sometimes, however, in this passus Russell-Kane print Kane-Donaldson's B readings over C, on the presumed grounds that the C text preserves archetypal B errors that are not sanctioned (e.g., lines 30 and 38). The implications of the two kinds of treatment at once in Passus 20 are blurred. Either the editors take the poet to have “looked over” the lines whose archetypal variants they decide not to emend to follow Kane-Donaldson, but not to have glanced at the nearby lines whose archetypal variants they do choose to amend according to Kane-Donaldson; or they assume that the poet made some tiny changes in Passus 20 that they approve of (“Auentrous” to “Auntres,” for example), but not others that they think scribal and thus emend back to Kane-Donaldson (Kane-Donaldson's “leyeth” vs. archetypal C's “hath leide” [30]; Kane- Donaldson's “cryde ` crucifige! ' sharpe” vs. archetypal C's “cryede ` crucifige! ' loude” [38]).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or, of course, Russell-Kane may be seen as confined in some ways by the choices of Kane-Donaldson and wishing to preserve, however awkwardly, the authority of previous decisions, just as Kane-Donaldson tended to keep A lines preserved in B in the form they had in Kane (in his review of Kane-Donaldson, David Fowler counted 684 cases of emendations to produce this result, the largest of any category of emendation in Kane-Donaldson that Fowler considered). In the same way, as the Athlone editions have preeminently shown, the poet was confined by his own, scribal copies of his antecedent texts. One measure of his greatness was his ability to accommodate or elaborate such constraints. A skeptic might claim that when Russell-Kane print a “sanctioned” form of scribally corrupt B which therefore differs from Kane-Donaldson, they are covertly admitting that Kane-Donaldson went too far, that, in effect, Schmidt was right to free himself from their bolder claims and return to the B archetype (see Russell-Kane 93-94). But the theories of the Athlone editions remain capable, if with difficulty, of containing the shifting texts they present, in large and small terms. More important, the strains visible in their presentation continue to provoke, not merely allow, full consideration of the alternatives. The efforts they exact from the reader, prompting that reader to contest and construct characterizations at any given moment and on the basis of a comprehensive array of scribal and authorial evidence, stands finally as the measure of the greatness of their editorial achievement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I indicated above, Schmidt's recent B and C texts are often more reasonable than the Athlone texts—Schmidt presents the archetypes of both B and C in a far less emended form, and the texts are much less prone to raise questions about their own authority. Yet Schmidt's efficient, reassuring presentation never forces the reader to confront the possibilities of a very complicated interaction between Langland and his scribes that both Hanna and Russell-Kane make clear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To show this, it would be easy to align any of Russell-Kane's challenging and ingenious emendations with Schmidt's failure to emend. But the point can be made better by examining closely a point where their texts exactly agree. This point in the C text of both editions conceals a tiny editorial crux, so small it is not noted as a crux anywhere in the Athlone editions, though it has intriguing implications both for editing Piers Plowman and for appreciating the poetic capabilities of the poem's scribal context. Pursuing the passage through Schmidt's and the Athlone editions demonstrates the intractable difficulties of the manuscript tradition and the character of the editions—as well as the limitations of any edition of the poem especially at the level of minute readings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At A.1.38-39, B.1.40-41, and C.1.38-39 Holy Church teaches Will something about the relation between spiritual dangers, his soul, and his heart; but the particular nature of her advice is varied in many of the manuscripts and in the editions of the three versions. I start with Kane-Donaldson's treatment, because it is the most overtly scandalous in its emendation of the manuscript evidence. They present a reading found nowhere in the B manuscripts but drawn, rather, from Kane's edition of A where it is based on a majority of manuscripts. The world will betray Will, Holy Church declares, For þe fend and þi flessh folwen togidere, And that [shendeþ] þi soule; [set] it in þin herte. This is straight Pauline moral warning and injunction, modified by the topos that the three great dangers to the soul are the world, the flesh and the devil: these together follow the world, and “that besmirches your soul; set this in your heart,” as Donaldson presented the lines in his translation. But the B manuscripts Kane-Donaldson drew from present the second line differently, as a moment of nearly Spenserian faculty psychology in which the soul and heart dramatically interact: “that seeþ þi soule and seith it in þin herte.” The only exception in B manuscripts is that R and in part F (resembling here the Z text) read “that sueth thi soule and seith in thin herte.” (I present a full apparatus for the line below.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Kane-Donaldson's boldly sustained view here is that the true B reading is preserved only in A because of the pervasive corruption of B. Indeed, none of the A manuscripts present a variation precisely like B's majority, so the principle of “direction of variation” seems in this perspective to point from B's majority reading back to A. Yet two A manuscripts seem to display some connection to the reading of the majority B tradition but construed in a different way, with a different portrayal of psychology: they state, “that schendith þi soule and seith it in þin herte”—that is, the dangers destroying the soul are what speak to the heart; here the lines define not the psychology of conscience but the mechanism of sin. C manuscripts, finally, generally parallel the majority B reading, as would be expected since Langland revised from a B text (even though Kane-Donaldson here emend the B text to what they take to be a more correct text than the one the poet himself used in revision). But elements of the A reading return to haunt three C manuscripts. One of these manuscripts (Add. 10574, “L”) is, apart from this passus and part of the next which include a C text, a B manuscript although it shows no consistent genetic relation with any other B manuscript (see Kane-Donaldson 10, 62n96). For the second line in this portion of its C section, it reads “For thei wolde shende thi soule be war of her wyles”—a paraphrase of the majority A tradition. The second C manuscript, Cotton Vespasian B XVI, “M,” reads “And þat sleþ þi soule and þow sette hem in þin herte” (that is, they will kill your soul if you place them in your heart—M's insertion of the subject pronoun insures that “and” will mean “if”). The third manuscript is “X,” Huntington 143, the copy-text of choice for all twentieth- century C editions: “And þat schenth þe soule and sayth hit the in herte.” In this instance the word “schenth” is tightly written, with suspended `n,' in a different but early hand over an erasure where “seeth,” for example, would precisely fit (f. 4 v ). The scribe went to some trouble to change the reading in order to accord with what appears to us as the A majority reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L's reading could reflect memory of another version of the poem—although since L is apart from this C section a B manuscript, unless L's scribe were remembering a very unusual copy of B (close, in fact, to what Kane and Donaldson speculate was the original copy), that memory would here almost certainly involve memory of A as well, where the reading L has here is most abundantly found: L's scribe would be a true Piers scholar of the fifteenth century! X's correction to “schenth” probably represents another kind of collation found especially in C version manuscripts: careful scribal checking of other C copies, which are distinct from manuscripts of the other versions of the poem in having circulated in a limited, dialectically defined area, near Hereford and the narrator's stated home in Malvern Hills. X has been corrected in small ways like this throughout; indeed, it also presents in a back empty leaf the four opening lines of another, lost C copy of the poem, a version related to the P not the X family, so far as can be discerned from four lines (see Grindley). It is clear, thus, that some owner or corrector of X consulted another C manuscript from a family that preserved many variations from the X family, although C manuscripts related to P do not otherwise read “shendith.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All editors face some embarrassing difficulties in treating this tiny crux. The language of the two main competing versions of the line differs so little in sounds and orthographic shape, yet so greatly in meaning, that calculated authorial revision is far less likely than scribal error, compounded by scribal ingenuity in decipherment and perhaps scribal zeal in seeking to recover the pure Langland, and perhaps in turn authorial interest in or “sanctioning” of what the scribes had generated. 10 But outlining a story for this is difficult; the manuscripts do not preserve unvarying loyalty to the main reading of their version—three A manuscripts here read as if influenced by C and B, and three of C read as if influenced by A. A tenet of the Athlone editions has always been the commonness of random and contradictory groupings of manuscript pairs in the Piers Plowman tradition, produced either by “coincident variation”—that is, the principle that errors that occurred once spontaneously might at the same point again spontaneously occur—or by memorial or other contamination, and paralyzing confidence in establishing genetic bases for editorial decisions. On the one hand, then, this appears to be a good case of the problem of coincident variation that Kane emphasized in order to reject establishing a certain stemma of manuscripts on the basis of shared error. On the other hand, the consistency of readings where the whole line jumps track from the sense conveyed by the A majority to the B or C majority, or vice versa, speaks against coincident variation, which might account for random parallels in one part of the line but seem much less likely to account for parallels in the whole line. The other possibility is memorial or textual correction: X, for example, was corrected, as already mentioned. M or its ancestor was evidently prone to correction from a text like the archeypal B text, because in fifty places it uniquely against all other C manuscripts reads like archetypal B (Russell-Kane 102n23). L is already a “mixed” text, so contamination would seem likely, given the availability of other versions to L's scribe. But all of these would need access to the majority A reading, not the majority B, and since M and L already have evident access to B, this circumstance multiplies the complexity of how such a reading might have arrived in their texts. How the non-authorial variant (whichever it is) started and developed is easy to see and set in one's heart; how it circulated and destroyed the previous reading, nonetheless allowing each reading sometimes to reappear, is much harder to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both main readings (i.e., shendeth/set and seeth/sayth ) are sufficiently coherent and interesting to deserve printing as part of the “living text” of the poem, but the two main readings cannot be confidently assigned to different “versions” of the poem or even different productions by the author. In different ways each is “harder” than the other, each bespeaks subtlety. In the face of such difficulty at this small a scale, any edition falters, and a choice must hide far more complexity and doubt than any critical apparatus can immediately present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this perspective, how the Athlone editors have treated the passage, and the poem, across nearly forty years, may not seem so scandalous. At first glance, the editors appear flagrantly inconsistent and counterintuitive: editing A, Kane ignored the majority reading of B and C; editing B, Kane and Donaldson ignored the majority reading of B itself as well as C in favor of A. But editing C, Russell and Kane accept the majority reading of C, thus denying either its absolute validity or A's. But the Athlone editors at least make both readings available in the text, and in a sequence that has an intriguing and intricate basis in their theories of the different states of the poem and intentions and attentions of the poet. Whether or not they have accurately located the fine line between the C poet's intention and sanctioning of B archetypal errors they have “left in” C, and the lost B and C readings that their emendations have sought to recover, they have accomplished the task of forcing readers to confront the fluidity and almost instantly suprapersonal status of the poem. Although they nowhere comment on the line, their approach allows them to present both possible readings while implying an explanation in their subtle, provocative, if unprovable account of B archetypal scribal participation and C revision authorial sanctioning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Schmidt makes the reader of the poem work much less hard. He chooses the simpler and more elegant correction that ensues by assuming that B and C should overbalance the reading in A: the corruption occurred in the archetype of A, never appeared in B, and of course was retained as the right reading in C. Schmidt's view on this reading is expressed with both consistency and economy in his Parallel Text edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Schmidt himself did not arrive easily at his solution, but less because of the difficulties of the text than those of finding his own editorial confidence. In his first edition of his B text in 1978, he accepted most of such readings that Kane-Donaldson had dramatically altered from the B archetype, but he seems not always to have known the reason for their emendations. In 1978, accepting their reading here as at most points, he even added a note by which in effect he tried to provide a rationale for what Kane-Donaldson had done, but which ends up in a circular logic that makes almost no sense at all and points to no recognizable editorial principle: “The complex variation in this line [B.1.41] easily explains corruption of an ostensibly easy word,” he states. As if this were not dizzying enough, Schmidt seeks support for Kane and Donaldson's reading from the solitary B manuscript, Cambridge University Library Gg.4.31 that had written “set” (it happens to be a very late manuscript: early sixteenth century); “as frequently,” he states, this manuscript seemed to be corrected from a B manuscript “superior” to the B archetype, “or from an A or C MS regarded as containing superior B-readings” (Schmidt, Complete Edition 267). How the “complex variation” in the witnesses to B.1.40 could “easily” explain “corruption of an ostensibly easy word”; how Gg.4.31 was so insightful as to know when to regard an A or C manuscript “as containing superior B-readings”—these are not questions Schmidt's textual commentary in 1978 could answer. So deeply was Schmidt in 1978 faithful to the text that Kane and Donaldson produced that he was willing to supply even absurd explanations where they from their Olympian heights had uttered none, except in all they had said about the B archetype's pervasive corruption.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Schmidt has been able to renounce his own editorial past, to a degree of which the Athlone editors are incapable. In itself this is admirable; had Kane showed more of this trait, the Athlone series might invoke less suspicion of face-saving ingenuity. In his 1995 Everyman edition of B (identical to the B text in his Parallel Text), Schmidt boldly announced his pervasive revision of the poem's text: “all printings before the current one are to be regarded as superseded” (Schmidt, Critical Edition xi). In part this turns out to be his emancipation from Kane-Donaldson (see, e.g., lxxiv). In the lines in question he prints the almost unanimous B reading, with a more felicitous rationale for its variants: “satisfactory in sense and confirmed by C.” G now loses its evidence of scribal insight and becomes a case of contamination “from an A source of the r-family” (365). With this comment on the line, Schmidt thus rejects not just the Kane-Donaldson reading in B, but Kane's reading in A too, where “set” becomes simply the reading of “the r-family,” that is, the majority group of A manuscripts which provided Kane with his reading. The A majority reading, then, is not only to be avoided in B, it is wrong in A—a position that Schmidt carries out in his Parallel Text edition, where A, B, C and Z all read as the B and C majority reading, requiring only the emendation of one word in the A text (although Z's seuth, i.e. `sees' with - uth instead of - eth, looks suspiciously like a mistake for the sueth found elsewhere, or, conversely, the source of sueth as an early misreading). In fact the only difficulty with this neat solution is that treating A's “shendith” as an error found in all the A manuscripts ignores everything Kane demonstrated and Hanna further elucidates about A's seven separate archetypes, agreeing in “not a single instance” of unoriginal variants (Kane 104).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, then, is a schematic view of the manuscript evidence and editorial choices for these lines. The chart lists the poem's “versions,” its manuscripts (as denoted by the normative Athlone sigla but not otherwise identified, except in the discussion above) and its editions (with Schmidt's 1978 B text designated as Schmidt1 and his 1995 Parallel Text as Schmidt2):</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SB 52, Page 084</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most notable features are again, of course, how or whether the editions have manuscript support; but as I have already suggested, the manuscripts' further, partial or cross-versional readings are thought-provoking as well. As noted above, Schmidt2 presents the most consistent and economical strategy, and requires little struggle by the reader: now all four texts present the line identically, and in the form in which, it is true, most medieval readers, doubtless including Langland himself by the time he came to reread B, encountered the line. But consistency and economy are not necessarily guides to historical truth. To reduce clutter on a page, and avoid section after section of a dense introduction, rife with arguments for printing a known scribal error—that is, to eliminate all the obsessive attention that Russell and Kane so constantly demand—is an immediate relief. The commentary in Schmidt's Everyman B text has, even before his commentary on the Parallel Text is published, already shown how he will spare us. But Piers is a tradition rather than an isolated “work,” the result of a complex, diachronic relation between Langland and his earliest readers that is nothing if not prolific clutter, which can be truly understood only by pondering the shifting authority of variants (whatever their origins) in Langland's own lifetime as well as the continuous process in which he was engaged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course, in this small instance Kane and the associate Athlone editors may simply be wrong, Schmidt right. And how we describe Langland's kind of poetry will change as a result. Schmidt's choice of lection here is for a more cerebral reading, in keeping with Schmidt's view of the “clerkly maker” who seeks allegorical effects at least partly for their own sake. Kane and the Athlone editors, by choosing a more directly moral reading and more direct didactic posture, choose as it were a more old-fashioned poet concerned with moral principles, not the frisson of allegory. But Kane and his co-editors provide us more perspectives because they insist that we adopt a complex theory of social and authorial intentions behind the work even if we do not accept their particular version of that theory, and because they force upon the reader the evidence that complexity of intention necessarily obtains in the poem's living text. Just as Kane insisted more than once in his introduction to the A text that “Far from the text... here being secure, as a glance at the critical apparatus might suggest, it is actually seriously in doubt” (155), and just as Kane-Donaldson demonstrated by their aggressive and obtrustive emendations and introduction how thoroughly non-authorial the B text archetype was, so now Russell-Kane, in their theory of Langland's consistency of poetic ingenuity but inability to keep in his own control his final—and I would say every—version of his poem, potentially challenge the reader to test all the possibilities personally. In the Athlone C text as in Hanna's study and Cowen-Kane's edition of Chaucer, it is a challenge we are encouraged to keep rising to, even though few readers will be able to sustain this exhausting endeavor for long stretches. Not just Schmidt's choice of lection in how the soul confronts the world, the flesh and the devil, but Schmidt's presentation of this reading as a clear and identical text in every version removes the taint of a vigorous and intimate relation between Langland and the immediate world that his poem so often addresses, evidence of which is tightly compressed into a lean critical apparatus. It is an efficient and elegant editorial solution, and it is likely to move Langland's text toward the familiarity, perhaps even susceptibility for memorization, that throughout this century has been enjoyed by Chaucer's. In contrast, the shifting Athlone “profile” of the author is only awkwardly held together as their project arrives at its ponderous fruition. Yet, however contradictory and deceptive, that project potentially impels constant labor by the reader to consider the mutual invasions of scribal culture into Langland's poem, and of Langland into scribal culture, the very process that the Athlone theory expressly seeks to put an end to. Reading the Athlone edition, particularly reading it against its own theses, is a painful struggle. Both Langland and his world deserve such pains.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">3 See Brewer's earlier essays for her sharpest attacks: “The Textual Principles of Kane's A Text,” “Authorial Vs. Scribal Writing in Piers Plowman, ” and “George Kane's Processes of Revision.” Her book, Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text, treats these problems in a more comprehensively biographical and historical discussion, and thus in a less pointed manner (345-408). Adams's balanced and rigorous evaluation of the Athlone B-text edition also emphasizes the problems of applying to B the “rigorously eclectic” methods used in editing A, but he ultimately explains this on the basis of the cognitive limitations of the Athlone editors' insistence on three discrete, successively released versions, since this allowed the editor of B to use A's readings (often found in C too) as “earlier” than and thus “superior” to those found in the B archetype. Adam's counter-proposal, that A was released post-mortem by the “literary executor” who also released the “incomplete” C text, explains some peculiar evidence associating A with C rather than B (e.g., AC but no AB spliced texts; AC shared readings), but does not entirely explain the circumstance that led Kane to edit A in a “rigorously eclectic” manner in the first place: in contrast to both B and C, there is no single reconstructable archetype for A, but rather seven sub-archetypes, suggesting some different process of release than that of C, by most accounts as unfinished at the poet's death as A was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 For Manly and his views, see Middleton 7-8. Attacks on the notion of three discrete versions are now increasingly common; see Pearsall, “Authorial Revision in Some Late- Medieval English Texts,” for an elegant instance by an avowed “intentionalist.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">10 Thus given the likely scribal origin of one or the other, this would not, at least at the first stage of its generation, be an instance of the important phenomenon of “versional micro-contamination” that Adams discusses (55-59).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BACK AT CHAUCER'S TOMB—INSCRIPTIONS IN TWO EARLY COPIES OF CHAUCER'S WORKES by Joseph A. Dane and Alexandra Gillespie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What is now known as Chaucer's tomb at Westminster Abbey was set up by Nicholas Brigham in 1556. The tomb has several inscriptions. These have been variously transcribed by antiquarians and Chaucerians for over 400 years; versions appear in William Camden's Reges (1600), in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1570), in the editions of Chaucer by Thomas Speght in 1598 and 1602, and in numerous later sources. The history of these transcriptions provides a record of how information is transmitted and often manufactured in scholarly traditions. Most of the presumed eye-witnesses repeat reports by earlier unreliable witnesses, and various “restorations” impose modern misreadings onto what must have been a barely legible original. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have recently found two sixteenth-century transcriptions of this epitaph in books at the Huntington Library and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas. One appears to be a direct and accurate transcription of the epitaph on the tomb; as such, it rather unnervingly undermines many of the basic premises and arguments developed in the studies cited in note 1 above—studies arguing that original readings are finally unrecoverable and that efforts to seek them are intellectually flawed. The other is directly related to the error-plagued versions that appear in the printed Chaucer editions beginning with the Speght edition in 1598; yet clearly this second transcription predates these versions. Together these provide evidence of the diverse channels through which literary evidence circulated in the late sixteenth century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first appears on the title page of the Huntington Library copy of Chaucer's Works (Kele, 1550?; STC 5072; RB #99584; see fig. 1). The transcription of the epitaph is in a nearly contemporary secretary hand, along with a version (in a second hand) of lines that Thomas Speght and others describe as “written about the ledge” of this tomb. These lines “about the ledge” were first printed by Camden in 1600; two years later, in the Preface to the 1602 Chaucer edition, Speght claims they are “clean worne out.” 2</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SB 52, Page 91.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The earliest mark of ownership in the book is on sig. A6 v at the end of the General Prologue (“Richard Wylbraham owneth this boke”), and the book bears as well the nineteenth-century bookplate of George Fortescue Wilbraham. Of several sixteenth-century possibilities, this early owner is probably Richard Wilbraham d. 1612. 3 There are in addition a few scattered notae in the earlier portions of the book marking general sententiae, and other marginalia that seem to correspond to the two hands seen on the title page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The epitaph reads as follows (abbreviations are expanded): The epetaph of G. Chaucer knyght. Qui fuit Anglorum vates. Ter maximus olim Galfridus Chaucer. conditur hoc tumulo Annum si queras domini si tempora mortis ecce nota subsunt. que tibi cuncta notant. 25 octobris anno domini 1400. Because the epitaph exists in multiple versions, a translation is misleading. But most, including this, can be paraphrased roughly as follows: Here lies Geoffrey Chaucer the great English poet; if you wish to know his dates, check out the notes below, which explain everything—25 October 1400. (This date is of course Chaucer's death date.) The two-line Latin distich that follows is in the same hand. Chaucer occubuit sed corpore, cetera magnis post cineres virtus vincere sola facit. I C B [Chaucer is dead, but his spirit lives on.] 4 We know of no other version of this distich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A second hand, also in a sixteenth-century secretary (we believe this is the same hand that signs Richard Wilbraham), then provides a version of lines that most witnesses say are part of the epitaph on the tomb (these lines are not printed in either Speght edition): recquies erumnarum mors N. Brigham hos fecit musarum nomine sumptus. [The relief of all troubles is death. Nicholas Brigham assumed these expenses in the name of the Muses.] There is no further room at the foot of the title page, and on the inner margin the same hand provides a version of what in the Speght edition are called “verses about the ledge” of the tomb (verses presumably unreadable by 1602): Si rogites quis eram forsan te fama docebit quod si fama negat mundi quia gloria transit Hec monumentie lege. [If you ask who I was, perhaps fame will teach you; and if fame denies this (since the glory of the world passes) read these monuments.] None of the early printed versions of the epitaph and the “verses about the ledge” (for example, those of Foxe, Camden, or Speght) could be the source for the particular variants found in the transcription in this book. 5 And the only version of the tomb inscription so far recorded that is earlier than these printed versions occurs in the 1562 manuscript notes by John Bale transcribed by Thomas Hearne in 1729. Hearne's transcription is as follows. 6 Hic Tullius minor dicebatur, tam erat artis dicendi peritus. Thomas Ocklevum Scribam olim habuit. Epitaphium Chauceri MS. Qui fuit Anglorum Vates ter maximus olim, Galfridus Chaucer, conditur hoc tumulo. Annum si quaeras Domini, si tempora mortis, Ecce notae subsunt, quae tibi cuncta notant. 26. Octobris anno Domini 1400 Nicolaus Brigam Westmonasterii hos fecit Musarum nomine sumptus. Super ejus Sepulchro. Si rogites, quis eram, forsan te fana docebit. Quod si fama negat, Mundi quia gloria transit, Haec Monumenta lege. [He was called a lesser Cicero, so skilled was he in the art of speaking; he once had Thomas Hoccleve as a scribe... etc.] Bale's version of the epitaph is very close to that in the Wilbraham book; and the two tend to agree on certain variants against all later witnesses. Neither could be a copy of the other, since each has text not found in the other (e.g., in Bale, the abbreviation M.S. [manibus sacris], and in the Wilbraham book the line “recquies erumnarum mors”). The most obvious explanation for such agreement is that these are taken directly from the tomb itself, or are more closely related to a direct and accurate transcription of the tomb than are any other extant witnesses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Apparently, the earlier annotator of the Wilbraham book transcribed a version of the epitaph and composed the two-line Latin distich “Chaucer occubuit.... ” Sometime after this, Richard Wilbraham, perhaps returning to the Abbey with book in hand, transcribed the last two lines, including the attribution of the monument to Brigham, and then struggled to find space for the “verses about the ledge.” The concluding Latin distich of the first annotator, one now sandwiched between the epitaph and the reference to Brigham, is very similar in its phrasing and sentiments to other Latin epigrams produced on Chaucer in the late sixteenth century, and perhaps others will recognize, as we do not, the source of the particular commonplaces expressed here, as well as what is mysterious to us, the signature I C B. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our second example comes from the last printed page of a copy of Stow's 1561 edition of Chaucer at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Ad C393 C56L sa (sig. 3u8 v ; see fig. 2). The transcription includes three sets of verses: the last two verses of a poem by Surigone (verses first printed in Caxton's Boece and included in many of the sixteenth-century Chaucer folios), the epitaph, and the “verses about the ledge.” The order in which these texts are given is the same as that found in Speght's Preface to the 1602 edition, and much of the surrounding commentary is similar: Geffry Chaucer dyed 25 of October. 1400. aged 72. years &amp; lyes buried in Westminster Abbey, with these old verses on his Tombe. Galfridus Chaucer vates et fama poesis Materne, hac sacra sum tumulatus humo. Afterwards mr Nicholas Brigham anno.1555. added this Inscription on his Tombe Qui fuit Anglorum ter maximus olim Galfridus Chaucer conditur hoc tumulo Annum si quaras domini, si tempora mortis Ecce notae subsunt quae tibi cuncta notant 25 Octobris, 1400 Aerumnarum requies mors. Nc. Brigham hos fecit musarum nomine sumptus About the Ledge of his Tombe Si rogitaes quis eram, forsan te fama docebit Quod si fama negat, mundi quia gloria transit Haec monumenta lege This reads much like a condensed version of Speght's preface. 8 But the epitaph has none of the very distinctive Speght variants, and the lines “Aerumnarum requies mors. / Nc. Brigham hos fecit musarum nomine sumptus” do not appear in Speght (Speght paraphrases the Brigham reference in English). The text, however, is very close to what we find in the early manuscript versions of Wilbraham and Bale cited above. Again, the nature of these agreements suggests that both the Bale transcription and the one in the Texas Chaucer are derived from the same manuscript version—one which resembled the less accurate source (or less accurately copied source) used by Speght in his edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The provenance of this copy supports this conclusion. The book appears to have belonged to its editor, John Stow. The black calf binding has been restored, but the cover is original and bears the initials “I.S.” Stow's distinctive, crabbed hand is found on sig. [2]X6 r , where he associates “The Dreame of Chaucer” with its modern title Book of the Duchess and records details about John of Gaunt's patronage of the poem. 9 It appears the book passed from Stow to his patron, Matthew Parker, the antiquarian book-collector and Elizabeth I's Archbishop of Canterbury. Signatures on the title page include that of Parker's son, the Reverend John Parker (1548-1618), inscribed in the red crayon used by both him and his father. 10 The initial “I” appears in the gutter of sig. [2]z6 v and Archbishop Parker's initial “M” appears on sig. 2H6 v in the same red crayon. It was characteristic for Matthew Parker to have his scribes annotate his many vernacular English manuscripts. He owned at least one unidentified copy of “Chawcer written,” and from this his scribes might have taken the version of the Retraction added in a secretary hand to the verso of the title page (none of the early folio editions of Chaucer from 1532-1602 has this text). All of the early manuscript annotations in this book seem to come from Parker's circle; the mixed secretaryitalic of the tomb inscription (fig. 2) as well as the hand seen in the historical notes and commentary in other parts of the book are consistent with hands seen elsewhere in Parker manuscripts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The source for the inscription in the book is very likely manuscript material of the sort used by Speght for his own edition. Speght states directly that Stow supplied him with materials (“a booke of Iohn Stowes ... ” 1598 edition, sig. c2 r ). Stow probably circulated such material through the Society of Antiquaries, which he and Parker founded in the 1560s. At that time, Parker was also responsible for enacting a 1568 Privy Council injunction, exhorting Englishmen to preserve evidence of the “works and monuments” of the English past. 11 The transcription of the epitaph and verses on the monument of the Thrice Great English Poet Chaucer would be entirely consistent with such Elizabethan antiquarian endeavors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two books illustrate two different kinds of literary witnessing. One is seen in the Wilbraham book: to transcribe what is on Chaucer's tomb, one simply goes to Chaucer's tomb. Somewhat curiously, Wilbraham and Bale are among the very few Chaucerians who seem to have thought of this; but then, there were no printed versions available to save them the trouble. The second is the more traditional. Information about Chaucer circulated through texts—texts that accumulated errors very quickly. The notes in the Parker volume as well as the preface in Speght's edition must be derived from a text circulating during the later sixteenth century, probably from the collections of John Stow. This text accumulated in its multiple copies the kinds of errors one finds in Speght's 1598 version (which is not even consistent with its 1602 reprint). Such a text, especially one from Stow, could account for the relations between the texts in Parker's book and Speght's printed preface. It would also explain the peculiar paradox of the “verses about the ledge.” Speght claims these are illegible, but then provides a transcription that is very close to that of the two earliest witnesses (Wilbraham and John Bale). That Camden, who surely was in Westminster Abbey at the turn of the century, should provide a clearly faulty text of these verses in 1600, is entirely consistent with Speght's claim in 1602 that they are “clean worne out.”</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CORRECTIVE NOTES ON THE STRUCTURES AND PAPER STOCKS OF FOUR MANUSCRIPTS CONTAINING EXTRACTS FROM CHAUCER'S CANTERBURY TALES by Daniel W. Mosser</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this essay 1 I undertake a reconstruction of four paper manuscripts— British Library MS Arundel 140 (Ar), British Library MS Harley 2382 (Hl3), Magdalene College, Cambridge MS Pepys 2006 (Pp), and British Library MS Sloane 1009 (Sl3) 2 —the collation of which has been characterized variously as “impossible” (Manly-Rickert 1:52, 516), “impracticable” (James 60; Manly-Rickert 1:406), “unknown” (Seymour 1966, p. 184), and “too tightly bound to be determined, even by watermarks” (Seymour 1995, p. 134). All four MSS do present interesting and challenging problems for the reasons described by Manly-Rickert and others: in Ar and Sl3, the material structures have lost their original integrity and the leaves are now mounted on guards (the guards can present problems for the detection of watermarks in 4° format); Pp is tightly bound, making problematic the detection of some of the watermarks in 4° structures; textual lacunae in Hl3 and Pp can be difficult to determine because some of their texts are extracts. The establishment of the present structures of these MSS and the reconstruction of their original structures (to the extent that these goals are attainable) provide important information for textual editors about their texts' original integrity or incompleteness. Texts of the Canterbury Tales that circulate independently of the frame provided by the poem's General Prologue may or may not include links referring to that larger framework. The structure I suggest below for Sl3, for example, suggests that some or all of the “Words of the Host” linking Sir Thopas and Melibee could have been present in this MS. While another Chaucer text, the House of Fame, occurs as a fragment in the first part of Pp, the structure postulated below could have accommodated all of the poem (Edwards' collation, detailed below, notes telegraphically that the MS “lacks 3 leaves containing end of House of Fame ” [p. xxiii], but the structure he proposes does not indicate how these might be included). Other texts in Pp may or may not have been fragmentary; only a clear sense of the structures available for those texts will provide us with an understanding of whether they could have been complete in their original form. Beyond the significance of these MSS as conveyors of important medieval texts is their importance for the evidence they provide about the processes of fifteenth-century book production. Edwards raises the issue of “booklet construction” 3 for the first part of Pp and concludes that: [Pp] does not show many indications of booklet construction on the—admittedly inconclusive—evidence of quiring. Insofar as the quire divisions are determinable, the scribes do not appear to have been constrained to define texts around them. It is, however, quite likely, given the variegated contents of the first part of Pepys, that it does reflect the collocations of booklet exemplars at some stage prior to the transcription of the exemplar of Pepys itself. (p. xxviii) The revised collation I offer below for Pp indicates that the first part of the MS does provide clear evidence of booklet structure for just that part of the MS where one might expect to find it: the Lydgate and Chaucer texts. This in turn clarifies the picture of how the exemplars circulated: together, assembled as a booklet. The expectations generated by the processes of paper manufacture in the fifteenth century are key to determining the structures of these books. The paper stocks in these MSS have not been well described and have in some instances been misidentified, even with respect to their generic morphology. Little, if any, regard has been paid to the principle of symmetry as it applies to the distribution of watermarks in gatherings, whether it be in folio construction (2°), quarto (4°), or some combination of these two formats (the only formats employed in these MSS). One expects, in fifteenth-century paper, to find watermarks in the left or right half of the full sheet, so that when folded 2°, one half of the sheet will bear the impression of the wire design of the watermark and the other will be blank. In 4° format, the portions of the watermark not obscured by the binding will appear at the spine-edge (i.e., in the gutter) and, of the four folios constructed from the full sheet, two will share the watermark (usually a top half and a lower half) and two will be blank. These facts create certain expectations about the structure of a gathering and, together with other facts about the manufacture of paper and its use in the production of books—whether print or manuscript—provide the bibliographer and cordicologist with invaluable tools in constructing a description of the structure of a given book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I British Library MS Arundel 140 contains: Part 1 1. “The Legend of Ipotis” (IMEV 4 220): fols. 1 r -5 r 2. Mandeville's Travels (B text: IPMEP 233): fols. 5 v -41 r 3.

Chaucer's Melibee (VII 967-1777/B2 *2157-*2967; missing VII 1459-1562/B2 *2650-*2752) 5 : fols. 166 r - 181 r The volume consists of two structural sections, the final item having been produced independently of the rest of the MS. 6 Manly-Rickert (1:52) describe three paper stocks: “Mont (2 or 3 varieties) and Basilique” in the first section, and “Ancre, Briquet No. 360 (1459) is perhaps nearest” in the Melibee. Seymour (1966, p. 184) concurs with Manly-Rickert's assessment of the paper stock in Melibee (folded 2°), as do I, but he suggests the first two watermarks are “unidentified, possibly ancre (ff. 1-27) and aile (ff. 28-165).” Manly-Rickert are correct here in their identification of the first watermark as a “Mount surmounted by a Cross” (“Mont”), although it is the same type throughout, occurring in a 2° format in fols. 1-20, 23-27, and 149-165. The second watermark is a Unicorn's Head in Profile ( Tête de Licorne, cf. Briquet 15803 [1406-8]) folded 2°, occurring in fols. 21.22, and 28-148. Manly-Rickert (1:52) believe a collation of the MS to be “[i]mpossible; all leaves now mounted on modern paper. Two folios missing between 177 and 178 (B 2650-2752).” Seymour (1966, p. 184) provides the following collation for the first section: 5+1 12 (wants 1, 12), 2-4 12 , 5 12 (wants 1, 2), 6 12 , 7 12 (wants 4), 8 12 (wants 5, 6), 9 12 , 10 12 (wants 1, 10), 11 10 , 12 12 , 13 12 (6, 7 fragments), 14 12 (wants 4-8), 15 12 (wants 12; two fragments bound before f. 165 do not belong to this quire). Of the section containing Melibee, Seymour's assessment in 1966 (p. 184) was that the structure was “unknown,” but in his most recent description he states: “Perhaps 1 12 (lacks 1), 2 8 (lacks 1-2, 7- 8)” (1995, p. 137). I propose the following collation 7 : Part 1: ॠ1-5 1 12 (-1, 12) 2-4 12 5 12 (-1, 2) 6 12 7 12 (-4) 8 12 (-5, 6) 9 12 10 12 (-1.12, 2.11) 11-13 12 14 12 (-4.9, 5.8, 6.7) 15 12 (-12; 10+१ 2 ). Part 2: 1 12 2 8 (-1.8, 2.7) This collation differs from Seymour's analysis of Part 1 of the MS with respect to his Quires 10 and 11. Quire 10 was originally a gathering of twelve leaves, folded 2°, now lacking the outer two bifolia, and Quire 11 is a gathering of twelve. (The following structural representations generally consist of four columns. The presentation is intended to suggest the symmetry of the gatherings' physical structures: the tops of the two center columns correspond to the inner and outer folios of the gathering and the folios at the bottom of these two columns correspond to the center bifolium. Commentary on material in the first half of a gathering is placed in the leftmost column, and commentary on material in the latter half of a gathering is placed in the rightmost column. The abbreviation “WM” denotes the half of a bifolium bearing the watermark; a period between folio numbers signifies conjugate structures [inferred where they are no longer physically joined]; the designation “OUT” is used to signify folios that can inferentially be construed as lost; “CW” abbreviates “catchword[s].” The quire numbers are inferred and thus italicized. Hereafter, “Q” abbreviates “Quire”; “Qq” abbreviates “Quires.”) Q 10 12 (-1.12, 2.11): 8 OUT 10 1 . 10 12 OUT OUT 10 2 .10 11 OUT 107.114 WM WM 108.113 WM 109.112 WM 110.111 Q 11 12 : WM 115.126 CW on fol. 126 v WM 116.125 WM 117.124 118.123 WM 119.122 WM WM 120.121 The Speculum Gy de Warwyke ends on fol. 151 v , at line 892 (“Do nouʒtaʒeyne his lordes wyll”), 142 lines shy of its usual conclusion. One folio ( 14 4) 8 could have accommodated these lines (double column format, ca. 45 lines per column). Seymour's collation of Q 14 suggests that 14 4-8 are wanting; there are, however, only six folios surviving from the original gathering (fols. 149-154, with watermarks on fols. 151, 153, and 154; 154 v has a catchword), and the distribution of watermarks suggests, rather, that fols. 14 4-9 are missing. If the first of the missing folios held the end of Speculum Gy de Warwyke, then the remaining (now-missing) five folios could have held the lost beginning of the Seuen Sages (figuring ca. 180 lines per folio in a double-column format, with 40-51 lines per column; the Ar text begins at what corresponds to line 951 in the text found in Egerton MS 1995). 9 The missing final folio of Q 15 would have been sufficient to hold the lines lacking at the end of Seuen Sages.

Bull's head ( Tête de Boeuf, a pair of twins, near Briquet 14970 [1454-61]; cf.

Q 12 consists of two unmarked folios (121.124) and the upper and lower halves of the second Bull's head (with symmetrical horns) (122.123). Q 13 has two unmarked folios, followed by the upper and lower halves of the first Bull's head (droopy horn), and another unmarked folio: Q 12 4 ; 4°: 121.124 CW on verson WM, upper half: reco=mold side 122.123 WM, lower half; verso=mold side Q 13 6 (-6); 4°: 125. 13 6 OUT 126.129 WM, upper half; verso=mold side 127.128 WM, lower half; recto=mold side This differs from Manly-Rickert's analysis of these final nine folios (1:246), which they believed were all part of an original gathering of ten (their Q 12). There is a catchword on fol. 124 v , which I construe as the final folio of Q 12. Seymour (1995, p. 143), who likewise combines the folios distributed in my Qq 12-13, suggests a final gathering of “12 12 (wants 10-12).” The distribution of watermarks militates against this. As Manly-Rickert, Seymour, and Keiser (private communication) all argue, the MS consists of three structural sections, with the scribe subsequently exploiting blank space at the end of them for added material. As the sequence of paper stocks indicates, the scribe combined two stocks to produce fols. 1-62 and used a third supply to finish Life of our Lady (through fol. 74, end of Q 7) and The Assumption of Our Lady (through fol. 86, end of Q 8 ). He then continued using the same supply of paper to copy Prioress's Tale, Second Nun's Tale, “Passio Sancti Erasmi,” “The Long Charter of Christ,” and the beginning of Child of Bristow (through fol. 120, end of Q 11 ). A fourth paper stock was required to finish Child of Bristow, the scribe for some reason making Q 12 shorter than necessary and overcompensating in his construction of Q 13. Utilizing the blank space on fol. 86 v , the scribe then added a gathering between fols. 86 and 97 (Q 9 ), copied the “Oracio,” and began the “Testament,” running out of space and spreading the remainder out over other blanks left from original stint of copying. These blanks point to three “booklet” structures, consisting of Qq 1-8 + 9; Q 10; and Qq 11- 13. 13</field>

A seventeenth-century collation of the MS's contents: pp. 392-394 Previous descriptions of the watermarks in Pp reflect a naiveté about the structure and appearance of watermarks in a 4o format (see also Keiser). Manly-Rickert attempt only an identification of a “Tête de Boeuf, which predominates in CT,” suggesting that it “bears some resemblance to several in Briquet (cf. 14238, 14239, 14244, dating mainly 1469-87)” (1:406). Edwards (p. xxiii) determines that two of the watermarks— Tête de boeuf —approximate “Briquet 15043” and “Briquet 15204.” For the remainder of the MS (the second part), he observes that “all the watermarks are in the gutters,” provides diagrams of three “ascenders,” and says that “[t]here are possibly additional, unidentifiable watermarks on pp. 239-40 (possibly a tête de boeuf ), 291-2 and 359-60.” McKitterick and Beadle (p. 42) echo Edwards' suggestion about the two Tête de boeuf watermarks “approximately resembling Briquet nos 15043 and 15204,” and further note “a croix (cf. Briquet nos 5590 and 5706), a five-pronged ascender, a forked ascender, and an arrow-headed ascender (for page references see Edwards, p. xxiii).” Both descriptions are misleading, especially the association of what is the upper or lower portion of a 4° watermark with a Briquet representation of a full watermark. The paper stocks in Pp occur as follows: 1. Mount with jagged bottom edge surmounted by a Cross ( Monts, unidentified), 4° (a pair of twins, one with a crossed ascender, and one on which the ascender appears to lack the horizontal elements of the cross): pp. 1-44; 73-189 2. Bull's head ( Tête de boeuf ), 2°, close to Briquet 15068 (1462): pp. 45-70 3. Bull's head ( Tête de boeuf ), 2°, nearest Briquet 15204-15206 (1440-51), but it is definitely not any of those; the watermark in Pp has two ears: pp. 193-226 4. Bull's head ( Tête de boeuf ), 4°, unidentified, with only the nostrils and (sometimes) the lower portion of the nose of the lower half, and a five-pronged ascender and (sometimes) the tips of horns, approximately 2.7 cm apart, of the upper half visible; similar to the second mark listed above, but with attendant chainlines 4.2 cm apart as compared with 3.8 cm apart in number two). Possibly similar to Picard Ochsenkopf VII.852; VII.564 (chainline spacing and alignment are closest to the latter) (1440-55); VII.435; VII.294 (1466-70); it is also very similar to a mark found in British Library Canterbury Tales MS Royal 17.D.XV, including the bent tip of the ascender (similar to Briquet, Tête de Boeuf, 15054 [1441-1445], with attendant chainlines 3.8 cm apart): pp. 228-290 5. Cart ( Char ), 4°, near Briquet 3544 (1433, with variants to 1473): pp. 291-390 The structure of this manuscript—really two separate manuscripts bound together—remains indeterminate in some sections. McKitterick and Beadle (pp. 42-43, with the suggested collation attributed to McKitterick) propose (“[h]aving regard to the sewing, stubs, and disposition of the texts”) the following: I4 (pp. 1-8), II8 (pp. 9-24), III6 (pp. 25-36), IV 8 (pp. 37-52), V 16 (pp. 53-84), VI 14 (pp. 85-112), VII 16 (wants 16; the remaining stub is pasted to 15) (pp. 113-142), VIII 24 (pp. 143-190), IX 6 (pp. 191-202), X 6 (4 and 5 pasted together) (pp. 203-212), X I6 (pp. 213-224), XII 8 (pp. 225-240), XIII 16 (pp. 241- 272), XIV 4 (pp. 273-280), XV 8 (pp. 282-296), XVI 8 (pp. 297-312), XVII 4 (pp. 313-320), XVIII 8 (pp. 321-336), XIX 4 (pp. 337-344), XX 12 (pp. 345-358) [ sic 15 ], XXI 14 (pp. 369-376), XXII 8 (pp. 377-392, but pp. 377-378 and 391-392 consist of two leaves pasted together). Edwards (pp. xxiii-xxiv) offers these “very tentative suggestions for the first part of the manuscript” (I omit the prose description of the contents and restructure the collation for more ready comparison with that of McKitterick and Beadle): 1 8 (pp. 1-16), 2 14 (pp. 17-44), 3 8 (pp. 45-60), 4 8 (pp. 61-74; “lacking 2 leaves after p. 70, one of which is supplied in a later hand”), 5 8 (pp. 75-90), 6 12 (pp. 91-112; “possibly a missing [?blank] leaf before p. 91”), 7 8 (pp. 113-122; “lacks 3 leaves containing end of House of Fame ”), 8 10 (pp. 123-142), 9- 11 8 (pp. 143-190), 12 12 (pp. 191-210; “+ 1 leaf pasted to p. 190 + 1 leaf pasted to p. 210”), 13 8 (pp. 211-224; “lacks 1 leaf after p. 224”) Second part: 1 8 (pp. 225-240), 2 8 (pp. 241-256), 3 8 (pp. 257-272), 4 8 (pp. 273-288), 5 8 (pp. 289-304), 6 8 (pp. 305-320), 7 8 (pp. 321-336), 8 8 (pp. 337-352), 9 8 (pp. 353-368), 10 8 (pp. 369-380; 2 leaves glued together after p. 377 and one leaf missing after p. 380), 11 8 (pp. 381-392; 2 leaves missing after p. 384) Neither of these collations makes specific reference to the distribution of watermarks (i.e. the symmetrical structure resulting from folding the paper 4° and 2°). While there are uncertainties, as must be the case with any hypothetical reconstruction, I believe the following best represents the structure for the first part of the MS: Part 1: 1 24 (-1, 2) 2 14 (-14) 3 22 (-1, ±2) 4 20 (-2.19, 3.18, 20) 5 24 6 10 7 8 (-8) Part 2: 1 16 2 16 ( 2 16 + χ 1 ) 3 14 4 18 5 6 6 (?) This collation is motivated by the physical evidence and the relationship of that evidence to the distribution of texts. The sewing is through the sides, rather than through the center of bifolia, and so does not indicate the middle of gatherings (“oversewing,” rather than the more usual “flexible sewing”). 16 The first part of the MS consists of two discernible sections signaled by changes in paper stocks, textual divisions (with a blank verso at the end of the first section), and breaks between gatherings. These sections consist of: pp. 1-189 (190 is blank), with runs of two paper stocks; and pp. 191-224 (a single paper stock, distinct from those in the first section). Further, in the second section, each of the texts occupies a single gathering in the structure I propose (although the Cato text may have continued into another gathering). The second part of the MS does not contain any correspondences of text, paper stock, and quiring suggestive of booklet construction. I detail this evidence more fully in diagrammatic format below.

In the remainder of Pepys Part 1, textual boundaries coincide with structural boundaries; previous collations have also failed to capture this important point. Pepys 2006, Part 2: In pp. 225-290, the lower portions of the 4° watermark can be very difficult to detect because they are often deeply buried in the gutters, often showing only parts of the nostrils. Between my second and third examinations of the MS, slightly over a year apart, I constructed a collation that originally had to rely on a series of hypotheses about where the lower portions of the mark should be expected. During my third examination, I was able to confirm the presence of those marks where I predicted they should be, but they are easily overlooked if one does not know what to look for and where to look.

The text of the Complaint of Mars ( ll. 1-28 [p. 378], 57-84 [p. 379], and 29-56 [p. 380]) was originally copied consecutively. The folio containing pp. 379/380 has been reversed, with the lower half of the “Cart” watermark appearing at the fore-edge. Thus the entire text might once have been present and the final 214 lines of text subsequently lost, along with the first 45 lines of the Complaint of Venus. At 28 lines per page, allowing for an explicit and incipit, this would require 4.6 folios. The final 43 lines of Anelida &amp; Arcite and the first 77 lines of Fortune are also lost; at ca. 32 lines per page in this section, another two folios can be postulated as missing. There is, however, a “vacat” in the gutter of p. 384 that appears to be written in the scribe's informal hand, and since the last line of Fortune provides a rhyme for the last line of text on p. 384 (“soueryn:atteyn”), it is entirely possible that this was the scribe's solution to a lacuna in the copy text. It is also possible that if more of the final part of the MS were extant, the postulated gathering 5 6 might be seen to associate with a larger structure.

(See Manly-Rickert 1:515 and the Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum Bibliothecæ Sloanianæ [British Library, vol. 1, pp. 202- 204]). The paper stocks are distributed as follows (cf. Manly-Rickert 1:515): 1. Unicorn, a pair of twins, one 9.3 cm long from tip of the raised hind foot to tip of horn, aligned parallel to chainlines 3.9 cm apart; the second mark measures 9.9 cm from tip of the raised hind foot to tip of horn, also with attendant chainlines 3.9 cm apart. Very close to Briquet Licorne Simple 9997 (1477-78), but in both marks the front leg descends below the chainline (this watermark also occurs in British Library Canterbury Tales MS Royal 17.D.XV): fols. 1-48 2. Unicorn, a pair of twins, the first (e.g., fol. 51) measuring 9.5 cm from tail to tip of horn, aligned parallel to chainlines 3.6-3.7 cm apart; the second (e.g. fol. 53) measuring 10 cm from tail to tip of horn, aligned parallel to chains between chainlines 3.9| 3.5 cm apart; the second has a fatter and squatter appearance (cf.

One leaf lost after quire 5.” The watermark distribution, however, does not support this hypothesis. I propose instead the following: 1 (?) 2 12 3 12 4 24 (- 1, 22, 23, 24) 5 (?) 6 4 The reasons for proposing this collation are detailed below: SB 52, Page 111. 22 SB 52, Page 112. Table Continued from Previous Page. The four new collations provided here derive from a consideration of the kinds of physical structures that can result from the folding of paper into gatherings. This and other kinds of physical evidence (scribal stints, textual lacunae, sewing, changes of paper stock, catchwords), taken together with the layout and distribution of texts in the MSS, argue for a limited number of possible structures. From among those structures, I believe the ones I propose here are the most probable and most reasonably account for the evidence provided by the testimony of these fifteenth-century witnesses.

      <field name="fulltext">1 I wish to acknowledge the help provided to me by Svato Schutzner, Juris Lidaka, Josephine Tarvers, and Stephen Hayes in response to queries posted to Medtextl and Chaucernet. I am also grateful to Dr. Richard Luckett, Pepys Librarian and Keeper of the Old Library (Magdalene College), and Aude Fitzsimons, Assistant Pepys Librarian, for allowing me to examine Pepys MS 2006 on several occasions, to the British Library and the staff of the Students' Room for making the three manuscripts described in this essay available to me, to Julia Boffey for answering several questions about the identification of some of the texts contained in these MSS, and to George R. Keiser for his suggestions on the description of Harley MS 2382. I have also benefitted from the thorough and detailed comments provided by the editor of this volume. 2 The sigla provided here in brackets are those used by John M. Manly and Edith Rickert (editors of The Text of the Canterbury Tales, hereafter “Manly-Rickert”) and are in standard use in Chaucer studies. 3 On the subject of the use of booklets in fifteenth-century book production, see especially Robinson and Hanna. Hanna defines the booklet in this context as “a group of leaves forming at least one quire, but more likely several, and presenting a self-contained group of texts” (100-101). 4 The abbreviations “IMEV,” “SIMEV,” and “IPMEP” refer to The Index of Middle English Verse, the Supplement to the Index of Middle English Verse, and the Index of Printed Middle English Prose, respectively. 5 References to the works of Chaucer follow the lineations of the Riverside Chaucer (ed. Benson). 6 The “independence” of the two parts of the volume are attested to by the differences in paper stocks, formats, and scribal hands and dialects. 7 There is no reason not to characterize the first five folios as part of a fragmentary gathering (probably a twelve; fols. 2, 4, and 5 bear watermarks), but so as not to make my references here unnecessarily confusing, I will maintain Seymour's quire numbering, referring to these folios as “π1-5.” The two added fragments in Quire 10, which are misbound, are foliated as “165.1” and “165.2.” The second gathering in Part 2 was, given the losses of text at the beginning and end of the gathering, at least a gathering of eight. 8 Lewis and McIntosh note the following omissions of text: “(1) two leaves between ff. 51 and 52 containing ll. 856-1011; (2) one leaf between ff. 76 and 77 containing ll. 2965- 3034; (3) two leaves between ff. 88 and 89 containing ll. 3976-4140; (4) two leaves between ff. 106 and 107 containing ll. 5674-841; (5) two leaves between ff. 114 and 115 containing ll. 6475-636; (6) two leaves between ff. 144 and 145 containing ll. 9304-467, but they remain as scraps and are bound between ff. 143 and 144” (1982, pp. 57-58). 9 See Brunner, p. 37. The Ar text of Seuen Sages begins “Hys comaundement þei dide belyue,” and ends “ʒef I wyll late þe wtowte oþe.” 10 The two fragmentary leaves signified by “χ2” are misbound in Q 15 following fol. 164. 11 Seymour's suggestion that the first folio is missing in the first gathering of Part 2 (despite there being no loss of text) is an inference based perhaps on the traces of “signatures” on fols. 167 v (“c”), 169 v (“e”), 170 v (“f”), and 171 v (“g”?). If these were accurate indications of the original structure (and their placement on the versos is itself odd), then it is conceivable that the first gathering in this section was one of fourteen leaves, with unknown material on the first folio, and with the final folio containing part of the text missing between fols. 177 and 178. The following gathering would still require at least seven folios to complete the text of Melibee. 12 Fol. 6 1 is now fol. 88 of British Library MS Sloane 297. 13 At the foot of fol. 96 v , the scribe writes “Quere plus inxijo folio post,” picks up copying at the foot of 108 r (following Second Nun's Tale ), fills the verso, writes “Quere plus in xxo folio post,” resumes the “Testament” on fol. 128 v , and completes the text of the “Testament” on fol. 129 v . I am very grateful to George R. Keiser for suggesting several corrections in the description and analysis of Harley 2382 (personal communication). I accept and follow his analysis of the scribe's progress of copying. 14 Although there is an explicit on p. 183, the material that follows, through p. 189, is the concluding section of The Three Kings of Cologne (see Edwards, p. xix). 15 Note that “XX12” should include pp. 345-368. 16 Sewing, through the side of the pages rather than through the center fold, can be seen, e.g., between pp. 4/5, 16/17, 30/31, 44/45, 68/69, 89/91, 98/99, 130/131, 146/147, 218/ 219, 256/257, 288/289, 304/305, 328/329, 340/341, 358/359, 372/373, 382/383. 17 The jagged edge of the lower half of the mark can barely be seen. Approximately 6.3 mm of the ascender shows on pp. 3/4. By comparison, on pp. 13/14, approximately 6 mm of the ascender are visible, and the corresponding portion of the conjugate lower half that is visible on pp. 27/28 is approximately 3 mm. The expected portion on pp. 37/38, then, could be predicted to be right at the edge of the gutter, where the edge is indeed just visible. 18 A blank quarter of a sheet is glued or pasted to what would have been p. 190 and is itself numbered “190.” Whether this was done for structural reinforcement or to obscure what has been written on the back of the folio (originally left blank) is not clear. Since the same procedure has been carried out on p. 210, at the end of the following gathering, and there is also writing on the blank space left there, I suspect the latter possibility. 19 Kengen: “[The text] corresponds to MS. O [Bodley MS Tanner 201] ff.66 r /6-87 r /15; 88 v /6-89 r /4, and 90 r /18-97 r /18, i.e. the section on Penance, Tribulation, Temptation, the Divine Virtues, the Cardinal Virtues, Meditation, and part of the section on Contemplation, omitting the last degree of contemplation and ending with the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. Even in these shared sections there are occasional omissions and additions.... There is at least one leaf missing corresponding to MS. O ff.70 r /12-71 v /18, from `dedly' to `purgatorye'” (10). 20 Hayes characterizes the text as “an abridged Middle English paraphrase translation of Richard of St. Victor's Benjamin minor ” (p. 185). 21 Not the Speculum sacerdotis (Title 1 of Book III of the Decretals of Gregory IX), as the rubric might suggest, but “a sermon, or perhaps a treatise in the form of sermon, by somebody used to preaching. It is pretty obviously a sermon by a man working in canon law, and probably addressed to other people enamored with that lore. Oxford would not be an unlikely place.... It sounds Wycliffite, very much so. It seems to belong to the genre `University sermons.' In this case, the preacher is taking a rubric as his theme, rather than a verse from the Bible. [It is] an unrelenting attack on the established clergy. The text is continuous, no gaps found between end of one leaf and beginning of another” (Svato Schutzner, e-mail communication 8 February 1997). 22 The text in Sloane 1009 begins with “Penaunce is the seconde medycyne of sy[n]ne after Noes flode.” While this could be the intended beginning of an extract, it omits an amount of text equivalent to 59 folios in Bodley MS Tanner 201 [= “O” in Kengen]. The watermark structure suggests that this gathering is fragmentary at the beginning and end. See Kengen, p. 10: “There is a least one leaf missing corresponding to MS. O ff.70 r /12-71 v /18, from `dedly' to `purgatory'.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DIPTYCH BY THE ROLIN MASTER DETACHED FROM AUTUN, BIBLIOTHEQUE MUNICIPALE, MS. 110 (S. 133). by Peter Rolfe Monks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This paper concerns a fragmented missal of French origin whose history remains incomplete but whose importance has long been recognised by historians of manuscripts and their illustrations. Its modern shelfmark is Autun, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS. 110 (S. 133). It was executed in a famous Paris atelier in the mid fifteenth century and was acquired by a Burgundian Cardinal-Bishop. Information about the volume has varied accordingly as it was supplied by connoisseurs, librarians, manuscript salesmen or art historians. Their ex parte perceptions offer discordances, omissions and factual errors that may provide salutary lessons for modern bibliographers of cultural patrimony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My commentary opens during the occupancy of the See of Autun by Bishop Jean Rolin II (1408-1483), created a cardinal in 1449. 1 It is believed that he ordered or acquired in the late 1450s the missal in question from the miniaturist who bears his name, the Master of Jean Rolin II, known as the Rolin Master for short. More will be said about this eponymous artist presently. The volume was destined for use by the canons in the Lady Chapel of the cardinal's cathedral of Saint-Lazare at Autun. 2 It joined an already prestigious diocesan collection, whose formation dated from at least the eleventh century. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Judging from the contents of a sister missal that has survived intact, Lyon, Bibliothèque de la Ville, MS. 517, 4 our Autun 110 (S. 133) contained a Calen- dar , Temporal, Sanctoral and Common of Saints. The volume was decorated with the prelate's emblems or variations of them, in the form of a cardinal's hat, the motto Deum time, the patron's coat of arms, and an episcopal crozier. It is also a fact that the missal was embellished with nine illustrations, of which seven small ones introduced textual divisions of the service-book, and two full-page pictures, which faced each other at the Canon of the Mass. One depicted the Crucifixion, the other represented God in Majesty, and they constituted a form of diptych. Six of the reduced format presented the following themes: Elevation of the Host, Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost, while a portrayal of Andrew headed the sanctoral. Autun 110 (S. 133) contains 335 vellum folios measuring 360 × 270 mm. It has suffered mutilation mainly on or near the folios that once contained illustrations. 5 Only one miniature (60 × 55 mm.) remains today, the Adoration of the Magi on fol. 30 v . I inspected the mutilated volume at Autun in 1982 and confirmed to my satisfaction that the painting was the work of the Rolin Master. There is every reason to believe that the other missing pictures were also executed in his atelier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is no record of manuscripts being removed from the capitular collection at Autun during the three and half centuries after the Cardinal's death in 1483. In accordance with a decree of the National Assembly in 1790 prescribing inventories to be made of all movables of suppressed religious establishments, the manuscripts of the Cathedral Chapter at Autun were catalogued late in 1791 by dom Edme Michel of the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Martin in the town. 6 Being considered of little value, the codices remained virtually undisturbed in the cathedral precincts until the Concordat of July 16, 1801, between Napoleon and Pius VII (1800-1823). The agreement ensured that in France diocesan establishments were restored to their canons and bishops. Canons of the Chapter at Autun were thus able to regain possession of their library. However, by 1829, the clergy were concerned that its contents were not under proper surveillance and decided to transfer them to the Grand Seminary. 7 The volumes remained in this milieu for some eighty years. Descriptions of varying brevity exist before 1880 but they are often unreliable for reasons that will unfold. Following the further separation of Church and State in 1906 the Seminary Library was sequestered and had to wait four years for its fate to be decided. In 1909 the Ministère de l'Instruction Publique entrusted the volumes to the municipality of Autun, the transfer occurring in the following year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of Autun 110 (S. 133) suggests its fortunes changed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, when it was cloistered in the Grand Seminary. After the defeat of Napoleon and the Restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy a period of intellectual stability ensued which encouraged cultural, historical and scientific groups and societies to flourish at all levels of society and in most regions of France. Bibliographical and library sciences developed in earnest. One thinks of Paulin Paris's Les Manuscrits françois de la Bibliothèque du Roi and Léopold Delisle's Le Cabinet des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Impériale. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A political refugee from Tuscany and a mathematical genius, Count Guglielmo Libri (1803-69), 9 was appointed by the Government of Louis-Philippe to visit repositories with important collections and to draw up inventories of the paleographical, literary and iconographic treasures he encountered. He was eminently suited for the bestowal of such trust, having become a naturalized French citizen in 1833, and later a Professor in both the Collège de France and the University of Paris; he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences within the Institut de France. He even found time to buy and sell printed books and manuscripts. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his role as official recorder of patrimony he visited in the 1840s numerous libraries 11 including that of the Grand Seminary at Autun. His notes on its manuscripts were published in 1846 and then reprinted in front of the Bibliothèque Municipale's inventory in the first volume of a quarto series of Catalogues of contents of Public Libraries in the nation's Départements. 12 As is well known, this series was the forerunner to the voluminous octavo collection of répertoires which commenced appearing last century under the auspices of the Ministère de l'Instruction Publique. 13 Here is Libri's short description of the missal with which we are concerned: “110. In-folio sur vélin.—Missale æduense.—XVe siècle. Donné par le cardinal Rolin”. 14 Had this service-book been already subject to acts of cutting, excising, dividing and plundering? Does the failure to mention any illustrations at all mean that the manuscript had none any more? We shall endeavour to answer these questions below. The 1846 Libri numbers are for the most part those of a pre-1789 catalogue. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One can be certain that by the early 1880s miniatures have been excised and pages mutilated, for at that date there exists another cataloguer's description of the missal. Mademoiselle Marie Pellechet arrived in Autun to study the liturgical history of the diocese. She took up residence at 14 rue Guérin and arranged to have the manuscripts and incunabula brought to her. Her inventory was published in 1883 and contained the following observations about the tableaux: “On a enlevé toutes les petites miniatures qui se trouvaient aux fol. 7, 28 v , 154, 171 v , 177, 223; au fol. 299, on a laissé en blanc la place où devait être peinte la miniature de s. André...”. 16 Several comments are called for. Inexplicably omitted is mention of the presence of the Adoration of the Magi on fol. 30 v . Secondly, she did not seem to be aware that the missing painting on fol. 223 for the text In vigilia sancti andree apostoli would have been Andrew, where the sanctoral commences, and that, if there were to be an illustration at the head of the Common of Saints (fol. 299), it would not have been Andrew. Lastly, she passed over in silence the two large Canon tableaux, from which one may deduce that neither was any longer in the volume. When Liebaert published his short paper in 1912, he included our missal but made no comment on its physical state. 17</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1924 appeared the four volumes of Canon V. Leroquais' ambitious scholarly catalogue of sacramentaries and missals in French public libraries. In the entry concerning Autun 110 (S. 133) he placed the Seminary number first and added Libri's in brackets. 18 He also corrected the erroneous foliations detailed by Pellechet, and characterised the decoration and paintings in as succinct a manner as possible: “Plusieurs feuillets mutilés—360 × 270 mill.—Miniatures: fol. 30 v , l'Épiphanie; 19 toutes les autres ont disparu— Belles initials fleuries sur fond or; riches encadrements formés de rinceaux de feuillage, de fleurs et de fruits au milieu desquels se jouent des oiseaux...”.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Moving forward in time we arrive at 1985, the year in which the Autun municipal librarian, Marie-Josette Perrat, mounted an exhibition to highlight donations of manuscripts to Autun libraries in the 15th century by members of the Rolin family. A modest but colorful catalogue marked the event. 20 For 110 (S. 133), Perrat was content to register the cataloguing activities undertaken by French conservators from Pellechet to Leroquais. She reproduced the miniature of the Adoration of the Magi in colour (p. 21). Samaran and Marichal in 1968 included the volume among France's dated manuscripts, a point which Charles Sterling reiterated in 1990 in his two-volume account of miniature painting in medieval Paris. 21</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question must now be raised about the present location of its eight missing paintings (two large and six small) assigned to the Master of Jean Rolin II. Cataloguing efforts to date concerning the valuable missal have been by the hands of connoisseurs, conservators and professional librarians. Those who exercised their bibliographical skills before the end of World War II may be forgiven for not commenting on the art work in this codex. There was only one small miniature to help identify the artistic provenance, and reproductions of the artist's hand were few and far between. Yet, independently of conservators, aspects of the iconography of the missals at Autun had been the subject of serious comment as early as 1931, by an American researcher. Her name was Eleanor P. Spencer, then a postgraduate student at Harvard College, whose subsequent scholarly studies on mid-fifteenth century French miniatures were to earn her numerous accolades and encomia from art historians on both shores of the Atlantic. She recorded in her doctoral dissertation, defended in 1931, the presence of a miniature of a Crucifixion on vellum which had been detached from an Autun missal and was then owned by Charles H. Parker of Boston. From her viewpoint as an art historian, she attributed the work to the same master (then unnamed) who had painted other Autun Missals. 22 In the ensuing thirty years she broadened her research to include other types of liturgical books and religious treatises, and encountered often the same artist's hand as in the Crucifixion folio just mentioned. In a 1963 paper, she studied the one hundred and eight illustrations devised with the help of a Dominican adviser to complement a French translation of Henrich Seuse O.P., Horologium Sapientiae, now preserved in Brussels, Bibliothèque Royal Albert Ier, MS. IV 111. 23</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, chonologically speaking, the second mention of the same Crucifixion leaf omits any reference to Spencer's thesis and proceeds as if the fragment had no identifiable earlier owner or history. One may consult the statement in the first all-American bibliography of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts on which Seymour de Ricci and W. J. Wilson, the publisher, worked in the thirties. They listed a detached leaf belonging to the same Charles Henry Parker, 42 Chestnut Street, Boston, Massachusetts. The single folio, measuring 320 × 260 mm., bore a miniature of the Crucifixion and was dated to the 15th century. They stated it was a loan item, since November 4, 1929, to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. 24 In fact, the painting remained in the Department of European Decorative Arts and Sculpture until December 19, 1939 when it was returned to Parker. 25 In 1963 Spencer appears to have forgotten the Parker Crucifixion entirely, since it was not mentioned when she had occasion to write about two manuscripts at Autun (unidentified as to subjects) having fragments in the Musée Rolin. To complicate an already confused shelfmark tradition, she called the host volumes “ms. 131 and 14a.” 26 It is clear that 131 is 108A (S. 131), while the other is 114A (S. 136).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next viewing of the Crucifixion leaf is in London, in the sale- rooms of Sotheby's in 1982. 27 The Catalogue contains a detailed description of the iconographical subject, an opinion of the condition of the painting, then the measurements and place of origin: “275 mm. by 230 mm. overall; dimension of actual miniature 250 mm. by 180 mm. [France Paris 1460-70]”. The larger of these two sizes clearly refers to the presence of a carved wooden frame. Concerning the provenance, one reads: “(1) The arms at the bottom of the miniature in the border have been obscured by the cropping but still show the upper part of a crozier so that this manuscript was presumably commissioned by a French bishop or abbot. (2) Martin Brimmer, President of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (note on back of frame).” It is also claimed that the painting “has been attributed to the Master of Jean Rolin II, active in Paris from c. 1449 to c. 1460, or perhaps a little later... While it shows certain similarities to this artist,... it does not seem to be the Master's hand but rather someone closely associated with him.” The lack of information about the provenance of the detached leaf is very evident, in the light of the pre-1982 published references. However, we must be thankful for one entirely new element: the former ownership by Martin Brimmer about whom more will be said below. It was a detail unknown or omitted by Spencer, by De Ricci and Wilson, and by Parker himself. In her turn, Perrat in 1985 seems to have been oblivious to the existence of the Crucifixion folio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sotheby's offered the same miniature for sale nine years later in their June 1991 catalogue, as lot no. 21. 28 The information on provenance is summary: “Martin Brimmer, President of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; sale in our rooms, 22nd June 1982, lot 19.” The reference to the crozier is moved to the Illumination section. The account of the subject matter of the painting is substantially the same as before, but the phraseology is varied. A fitted case is said to measure 274 × 233 mm. The opinion is expressed that the host manuscript is still preserved at Autun and could be “ms. 131”. 29 The earlier attribution of the illustration to an associate of the Rolin Master is abandoned in favor of the Master himself. “Though the patron was perhaps Burgundian, the artist probably worked in Paris. His style here shows a strong link with the Coëtivy Master (probably Henri de Vulcup) who worked in Bourges and the Loire valley, and he may have trained in central France or have moved eastwards through Autun on his way north. He may have worked with the Bedford Master on the Salisbury Breviary, and his style later becomes very close to that of Maître François and these painters are easily confused. Here we see him at his very best”. Many of the alleged influences in this account were discredited long before 1991, especially those of the Coëtivy Master and Maître François. 30</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Following the publicity of the Sotheby auctions, Nicole Reynaud made brief iconographic comments on the painting in the 1993 catalogue of an exhibition of manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. 31 My own discussion of the Brimmer Crucifixion is shared between the 1997 article on the Lyon folio of God in Majesty and the present paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are two elements about the Crucifixion folio that cause me to believe that it was removed from Autun 110 (S. 133) rather than 108A (S. 131). These are the size of the folio and the similarity of the border design with that of a companion tableau of the diptych for the Canon of the Mass. But first, I shall explore the history of the leaf and its host volume between Autun in the 1840s and its sighting by Spencer ca. 1931. It was not until after the fall of Louis-Philippe in 1848 that rumours began to circulate among bibliophiles, libraires and conservators of all manner of collections that select treasures were noticed to be missing or mutilated, and even to be offered for sale on the open market. Suspicion fell, above all, on Libri. He did not assist his own cause when he abandoned his academic responsibilities in the middle of the 1847-1848 session and fled to London with eighteen large packing cases crammed with volumes. 32 A complete picture of Libri's acts of vandalism has never been attempted, but is long overdue. 33 The publications on the subject by Delisle were numerous, and papers in our time by Munby and McCrimmon only serve to confirm the need for such an overview. 34 In 1898 an aging Delisle composed one more chapter about the Count's crimes with a paper which focused on the blatant theft of large fragments of five priceless codices dating from the 6th to 11th centuries; gatherings removed in situ had appeared at public sales and been rebought by the Bibliothèque Nationale. Delisle established conclusively that all host volumes were in the Autun Chapter Library long before Libri inspected it, and what is more disturbing, these were not in the 1846 Catalogue drawn up by him. 35 It is difficult to believe that Libri was not culpable in the spoliation of our mid fifteenth-century missal. He had the disposition to vandalise, the chance to remove miniatures, and the occasion during his official visits to libraries. How easy it would have been to fold excised sheets in order to conceal them in a coat or jacket or satchel. 36</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What is perhaps not appreciated enough by book historians is the fact that devastation of manuscripts by connoisseurs and bibliophiles was at its height in Europe between the 1830s and 1870s, or even earlier. High prices were paid at sales and auctions for single folios of quality or renown, or for collections of cuttings removed from codices and bound together in portfolios without a trace of provenance. In England the names of William Young Ottley (1771-1836), John Boykett Jarman (1782-1864), and John Ruskin (1819-1900) are among those associated with the practice. The vast subject of mutilation of manuscripts in the name of art still needs thorough researching, a start having been made by Munby 37 and Janet Backhouse of the British Library. 38</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strengthening my suspicions that such was the fate of the Crucifixion now being pursued is the fact that between Libri's visit to Autun in the early 1840s and Pellechet's visit in the early 1880s, the leaf disappeared. On some occasion in this time span it passed into the hands of an eminent United States citizen, Martin Brimmer (1829-1896). 39 Born in Boston and educated at Harvard College between 1845 and 1849, he then entered on his grand tour of Europe and remained there for two years. He studied at the Sorbonne and traveled extensively. He also went to Europe on other occasions before 1880. The availability, clandestine or otherwise, of the cutting in the period following Libri's visit to Autun in the forties, happens to coincide neatly with Brimmer's presence in France in the fifties, but, of course, he may have purchased it on later visits to the Continent. 40 Whether he was aware of the origin of his newly acquired tableau is not known. I doubt very much that he was apprised of its provenance, and even if such were the case, why should he have been concerned? He was merely acquiring a work of beauty to display back home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then there is the matter of a crease on the Brimmer Crucifixion folio. The fold mark, approximately one third the way up from its surviving lower edge, is slightly higher on the right side than the left. A Société Éduenne God in Majesty (373 × 270 mm. overall) has a similar mark in much the same place. 41 This time the crease is slightly higher on the left of the painting. Another of the society's detached leaves containing a representation of Andrew (360 × 265 mm. overall) also displays a crease across it. It is highly probable that these three folios were removed from their respective host manuscripts at the same time. They may well have been placed in the following order: God in Majesty and Crucifixion facing each other, both on top of Andrew; the latter was then folded around them, but upside down. Such an act would cause the fold line to descend from upper right to lower left on Andrew, with a consequential mark across the Crucifixion. As would be expected from such careless treatment, pigments, particularly blue ones, are considerably rubbed, and flaking has occurred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Crucifixion on vellum owned by Brimmer remained in the north- eastern United States and was later in the possession of another Bostonian, even appearing as a loan item in the collection of the city's Museum of Fine Arts. What is interesting here is that neither Spencer nor De Ricci mention Brimmer when cataloguing the item as Parker's property. It becomes important to explore further the life of Brimmer to ascertain if the name Parker appears among members of his family's social and religious circle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brimmer died in 1896 while still holding the office of President of the Museum of Fine Arts. It is not surprising that the funeral oration for such an eminent Bostonian was preached in Trinity Church, where he had worshipped. 42 Brimmer had no children, but his life and endeavours were enriched by support from friends. One in particular, the art critic Charles Callahan Perkins (1823-1886), had prior to 1850 “proposed an art museum for Boston but had found the plan premature. When others twenty years later revived this project he supported it gladly. He was second among the incorporators...”. 43</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A close friend of Brimmer was a co-worshipper at the Trinity Church, Charles Henry Parker, Sr. (1816-1908). 44 Their signatures appear together at the end of a Committee's Report for their church in 1871. 45 Parker was married to Laura Wolcott Jackson, and issue included two sons, Samuel Dunn Parker and Charles Henry Parker, Jr. (1872-1957). Insights into the last-named's life may be gleaned from biographical sketches from his own pen. 46 He was born a Bostonian into an Episcopalian family, attending regularly Trinity Church of which he later became the historian. Following preparation at Hopkinson's School, he went to Harvard, graduated in 1896 and attended Harvard Law School for a year. He became a trustee for various companies and assisted in charitable activities connected with the Massachusetts General Hospital. He was a life member of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. Brimmer too, a generation or so before him, had actively supported many of these organisations. In the nineteen twenties and thirties Parker was a patron of the Fine Arts Museum, lending the institution the Crucifixion which had formally been in the possession of their founder President. A curious coincidence of the name Perkins occurs in Parker's life. In 1909 he married Winifred Edith Singleton Perkins. She died in Boston September 11, 1924.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These connections, associations and common cause between Brimmer, Perkins and the two Parkers, presented conditions and circumstances to enable Brimmer to pass on or sell his Crucifixion either to Charles H. Parker, Sr. who may then have bequeathed it to his second son, or to Winifred Perkins. She could easily have bequeathed it to a niece or granddaughter after 1886. Parker Jr. would have acquired it on the death of Winifred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How the Crucifixion from Autun, which had traveled incognito to America, and had been preserved through the foresight and appreciation of these cultural leaders, arrived twenty-five years later in Sotheby's sale-rooms still remains a mystery, at least to me. Nor have I been able to ascertain the name of a purchaser at the 1991 auction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before examining the stylistic elements displayed in the Brimmer leaf containing the Crucifixion, another matter needs be taken up: a diminution in size between the time Parker Jr. held it and the time it was offered for sale in 1982. When inspected by De Ricci, the size overall was 320 × 260 mm. and when marketed by Sotheby's, approximately 275 × 230 mm. In other words, a trimming had occurred, some 45 mm. of length and 30 mm. of width having been removed in the bas de page area and less on the three other edges. It is known that for both components of the Canon diptych, the border layout was almost congruent. By a study of the ornamentation around God in Majesty belonging to the Société Éduenne we can form an idea of what is missing from the Crucifixion border. Both borders follow a more or less identical system of applying a vegetal pattern. A burnished gold band over-painted with tightly petalled flowers runs around three sides of each miniature. Such bands are in turn surrounded by elegantly painted foliate decoration, where heavier swirls of blue acanthus leaves have been permitted to alternate with more lightly depicted areas of ivy tendrils picked out in gold and variously colored small flowers. The outer margin of Société Éduenne God in Majesty has a scroll, centrally positioned, which contains the Rollin motto Deum time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the bas de page area of the same God in Majesty is a medially placed episcopal crozier whose crook is visible but whose shaft is hidden behind a cardinal's hat atop a shield emblazoned with the Rolin arms. These emblems occupy about 45 mm. If a copy of the crook designed for the Brimmer Crucifixion crozier is laid over the crook of the God in Majesty crozier, their identity is apparent. In each, the curvilinear design is bold and firmly drawn and gilded. The crook turns in on itself in a dramatic `U' and has a small quatrefoil device in the circular area created by the stem bending back to meet the staff. The line of the crook then sweeps out in a half circle and terminates in a second quatrefoil artifice. The outer edge of each crook is decorated with ten or eleven gold balls. As for the left hand margin of the Crucifixion leaf, it may well have displayed the scroll and motto occurring in the right-hand outer margin of the Société Éduenne God in Majesty. This identification element occupying about 20 mm. has also been lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the exact number of millimetres trimmed from all sides of the Crucifixion painting cannot be verified, it is almost certain that the removed edges contained vital evidence of former ownership such as a cardinal's hat and shield. Whoever reduced the leaf in size between Parker Jr.'s ownership and 1982 was not aware of the existence elsewhere of a facsimile border layout in the other diptych element. Furthermore, after allowance for trimming in the manner already examined, the folio size of both components of the diptych approaches closely that of Autun MS. 110 (S. 133) which is now 360 × 270 mm. One cannot be more precise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The comparisons of style and emblems just made do not allow us, however, to claim that the Brimmer Crucifixion and the Société Éduenne God in Majesty were from the same manuscript. We must look elsewhere for a match. The discovery of the God in Majesty leaf that is the second element of the diptych, I attribute to my colleague, Emeritus Professor Keith V. Sinclair of Townsville. In his search for devotional works of a fragmentary nature, he had approached the Musé des Beaux-Arts de Lyon and received a response to the effect that the gallery owned a large portrait of God in Majesty without text. Knowing of my interest in such iconography, he passed the details to me and I followed the trail with the gallery administration. I was hoping the leaf would be large enough to represent a relic of a canon diptych, and it was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Its shelfmark is Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Inv. no. D 471, measuring 378 × 287 mm. It was acquired, it seems, in 1890 from the Chambre de Commerce de Lyon. How it had earlier passed to this corporation is not known. Clearly, however, in the Autun-Lyon areas amateurs had been collecting detached folios from all manner of medieval codices. Briefly stated, the work contains all the stylistic elements of the Rolin Master, while the border decorations similarly reflect motifs and designs practised in his atelier. 47 The portrayal of the Almighty, and of the four Evangelists outside the oval mandorla of clouds, equally declare the presence of our painter's hand. No Cardinal Rolin emblems are reproduced in the borders. Since they were already included in the ornamentation of the Crucifixion opposite our God in Majesty in Autun 110 (S. 133), one would not expect them to be repeated on a facing sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Equally significant are two other elements in common with the Brimmer Crucifixion, the leaf measurement and a crease. The approximation between folio sizes supports my contention that the God in Majesty in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon derives from Autun 110 (S. 133). On close examination, the leaf may be seen to be marked by an horizontal crease identical to that of the Brimmer painting. It may very well have been placed with the grouping of the three leaves mentioned above, but behind the representation of Andrew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Apart from this damage, the leaf has not suffered the mutilation of its accompanying Crucifixion. The splendid condition in which it now appears is due to its careful preservation by the Musée des Beaux-Arts since its acquisition. A large area near the lower left hand portion of the folio was almost ripped off. A smaller piece of the vellum was lost but has been skillfully replaced by a sympathetic restorer who copied sensitively the original foliate decoration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of the diptych components has been shown to be colorful. There have been in all sixteen diverse reports on the two large fragments or their host manuscript: Secretary of Jean Rolin II in 1462, Edme 1789, Libri 1846, Pellechet 1883, Leroquais 1924, Spencer 1931, De Ricci 1936, Spencer 1963, Samaran and Marichal 1968, Sotheby 1982, Perrat 1985, Sterling 1990, Monks 1990, Sotheby 1991, Reynaud 1993, Monks 1997. This paper has also drawn attention to apparent inexactness and false trails in cataloguing endeavours. It is to be hoped that my observations will prompt manuscript librarians to examine their collections of detached leaves to ascertain if any of the other six miniatures have survived among them. The subject matters of these, it will be recalled, are: Elevation of the Host, Nativity, Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost and Andrew. If the whole folio has come down without damage, it should measure approximately 360 × 270 mm. Where only the miniature survives as a cutting, its size would be 60 × 55 mm. or 85 × 55 mm. 48</field>

The circumstantial evidence was overwhelming, and Libri's own erudition served to condemn him. Delisle asked the crucial questions: `Who else was capable of choosing them? Who else had the means to carry them away?' Libri did not actually have to carry them all away, for the librarians sent some of them to him and he merely neglected to return them. Others he acquired by barter, a method more clearly unethical than illegal.” In The Earl and the Thief, 6, Munby relates the anecdote: “A writer in the Bulletin du Bibliophile of 1888 recalled the sinister impression which he made upon the librarians he visited, clad in a capacious cloak and armed with a stiletto, for he said, the Carbonari had put a price on his head.”</field>

      <field name="heading_text">WATERMARK EVIDENCE AND INFERENCE: NEW STYLE DATES OF EDMUND SPENSER'S COMPLAINTS AND DAPHNAIDA by Adrian Weiss *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a recent note, Jean R. Brink called attention to the problem of the dating of several of Edmund Spenser's works because of discrepancies among the dates given in imprints, dedications, and entries in the Stationers' Register. 1 The crux of the problem is whether Spenser and his publishers followed the Old Style Julian calendar or New Style Gregorian calendar, with the new year beginning respectively on 25 March and 1 January. Brink demonstrates convincingly that the New Style ought to be applied consistently in editorial treatment of dates in modern editions and critical discussions. According to Brink, the dating of Daphnaida remains a “major dilemma” in the chronology of Spenser's works. Daphnaida is an elegy commemorating the death of Lady Howard Douglas in August 1590 (see title transcription below). In brief, Spenser's dedication is dated “London this first of Ianuarie. 1591.” which, if interpreted according to the Old Style dating convention, actually signifies the New Style calendar year 1592. Two problems arise with respect to the Old Style interpretation: (1) since Lady Douglas died in August 1590, the long delay in writing the elegy needs explanation; (2) more significantly, as Francis Johnson notes, “then we must explain why Colin Clout is dedicated from Kilcolman on the 27th of December, 1591, just five days earlier, for Spenser could hardly have been in Ireland on the one date and in London on the other.” 2 As yet, nothing more than common sense reasoning has been offered to settle the issue. The purpose of this study is to present bibliographical evidence which: (1) demonstrates that the dedication and imprint are indeed dated in the New Style, some four months after the death of Lady Douglas in August 1590; and (2) resolves a long-standing problem involving the 1590 imprint date of Muiopotmos and the printing sequence of the four sections of Spenser's Complaints.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Complaints is a quarto collating A-Z 4 (no pagination); the first three leaves of each gathering are signed except the title-pages and A3, E2, and T3, with instances of mis-signing at G2, X3, and Y2 (see Johnson for complete bibliographical description and discussion). The significant bibliographical facts for this study follow. Although Complaints contains nine verse texts which are listed in the correct order but with modified title-texts on A1 v under the sub-title “A note of the sundrie Poems contained in this Volume,” the volume is sectioned into four bibliographical units by the appearance of four title-pages printed on the recto of the first leaf of their respective gatherings at A1, E1, L1, and T1, with the versos left blank. The four title-pages are printed within the same ornate compartment formed by woodcut borders. The text that is common to all four title-pages is from exactly the same setting of types in all four. The arrangement and spacing of type and ornaments within the compartment accommodate the changes in individual title-texts, which are: A1, “Complaints.| Containing sundrie | small Poemes of the | Worlds Va-| nitie. | VVhereof the next Page | maketh menti -| on. | By ED. SP. ”; E1, “THE| Teares of the Mu-| fes.| By ED. SP. ”; L1, “PROSOPOPOIA. | Or | Mother Hubberds Tale. | By ED. SP. | Dedicated to the right Honorable| the Ladie Compton and| Mountegle. ”; and T1, “MVIOPOTMOS,| Or | The Fate of the Butterflie. | By ED. SP. | Dedicated to the most faire and| vertuous Ladie: the Ladie| Carey. ” An ornamental arrangement of four pointing-finger hands appears under the title texts, followed by an invariant setting of the imprint at the bottom of the compartment: “ LONDON. | Imprinted for VVilliam | Ponsonbie, dwelling in Paules| Churchyard at the signe of| the Bishops head. ” The dates appear in a separate oval compartment in the bottom woodcut. The “1591.” date is set in the same group of types in A1, E1, and L1; the “1590” date in T1 is a different setting entirely. Johnson lists forty-four copies and notes the probable existence of “25 more sound copies.” The latter reference implicitly differentiates whole copies containing all four sections from “a great many fragments” which contain one or more sections as defined by one of the above titles. The choice of the term “fragments” is unfortunate. It seems clear that the distribution of the nine verse texts into four bibliographical units with first-leaf recto title-pages could have been a deliberate marketing strategy, given the fact that unbound quartos were usually sold as packets of sheets, each folded twice—once along the short axis, and then a second fold along the resulting short axis. The folded sheets were “unopened,” that is, the fold at the top of the sheets had not yet been sliced open (like an unopened envelope) to produce free swinging leaves, and the extremely uneven deckle edges of the sheets were “uncut,” that is, not yet trimmed to produce the smooth even edges of a bound book. The packet of twice-folded sheets was tied around cross-wise with string. 3 We assume that, usually, all of the sections of a book would have been tied up as one unit, but this depends upon the relationship among the sections, and holds true primarily when they are parts of a single work. However, in this instance, each section could have been tied up and marketed as a separate book, or all four could have been purchased for binding into a complete set. Daphnaida could have been included at the same time, as seems to be the case in the Huntington copy. A bookshop browser would have had difficulty in discovering the inaccuracy of the first title-page's text if it were tied up as a separate unit, e.g., “Containing sundrie small Poemes of the Worlds Vanitie.” This first section contains only one work, The Ruines of Time, but the running titles which reveal that fact would have been inaccessible, buried in the top fold of the sheets, unless the prospective purchaser untied the packet to free the folded leaves. The running titles of the outer forme (sigs. 1r-2v-3r-4v) of each gathering would be obvious, but those of the inner forme (sigs. 1v-2r-3v-4r) would be extremely difficult to read in the top folds of the stabbed and stitched gatherings. On the other hand, the title-pages of the other three sections specify a single poem, although each contains additional poem(s), all of which are independent works. The existence of the “great many fragments” consisting of one or two sections suggests the probability that the fragmentation occurred at the point of purchase rather than being the result of the disintegration of previously whole copies, as the term usually suggests. For instance, a copy of a play-quarto which lacks the final act is classifiable as a “fragment” and easily recognized as being incomplete. On the other hand, a “fragment” containing the complete text(s) of a poem(s) will appear complete to the purchaser unless, as is the case with the first section of Complaints, a table of contents establishes that something is missing. Then as now, purchasers probably would ask for the title that most interested them. Teares of the Muses could be understood either to be a part of Complaints or a separate book depending upon the purchaser's knowledge of the relationship between them. Interestingly, in terms of the hierarchy of bibliographical encoding, 4 the first title-page encompasses the lot and hence is taken by bibliographers as the “title” of the whole book, the original intention that is indeed indicated by the table of contents and the sequential signing. But the remaining three title-pages are subordinated only by virtue of physical association, and exactly duplicate the bibliographical encoding of a main title-page, i.e., the elaborate frame constructed by the woodcut borders. A purchaser, understanding this common component of encoding, could easily have believed that each of the three remaining titles pages was a primary title-page for a self-contained work. Daphnaida is a short quarto consisting of 12 leaves (3 sheets) collating A-C4, the first three of each gathering signed except the title-page. As with two of the sections of Complaints noted above, Daphnaida contains a title-page (A1 r ) dedication: “ Daphnaïda. | An Elegie vpon the| death of the noble and vertuous| Douglas Howard, Daughter and | heire of Henry Lord Howard, Vis-| count Byndon, and wife of Ar-| thure Gorges Esquier.| Dedicated to the Right honorable the Lady| Helena, Marquesse of Northampton.| By Ed. Sp.” The title-page conforms to the traditional austerity of funereal elegies. The text of the imprint differs from that seen in the title-pages of Complaints: “ AT LONDON | Printed for VVilliam Ponsonby, dwelling in | Paules Churchyard at the signe of the| Bishops head 1591.” Only three copies are extant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In general, analytical bibliography attempts to resolve dating problems by establishing the location of a given book in the printing schedule of the books produced in a shop during the proximate temporal period. Given the prevalence of shared printing (i.e., a given book printed in sections in several shops), the first order of business is to verify that a book was printed either entirely or in part in the shop specified in the imprint. 5 A combination of ornamental evidence and typographical evidence leaves no doubt that Thomas Orwin (London printer, 1587-1593) printed both Complaints and Daphnaida as well as two other texts published by William Ponsonby (London publisher, 1577-1604) in early 1591. 6 The attempt to determine the position of the target book in the shop's production schedule relies upon a combination of external evidence (e.g., a Stationers' Register entry date, and/or dated dedications, letters, poems, etc.) and internal evidence consisting of two kinds of bibliographical facts that can be gleaned from an examination of originals. First, an analysis of the progressive states of contamination of a font (or fonts) used in the target book and other books printed during the proximate period can provide conclusive evidence of the printing sequence. 7 In this instance, a font analysis is not expedient because Orwin used black letter, 94mm roman, and pica roman alternatively as text-fonts during 1591. In combination with the short length of many of the twenty-nine books from 1591, this fact diminishes the available typographical samples of each font to far below the level needed for a reliable progressive-state analysis. Second, the papers used in books during the proximate period can be surveyed and catalogued with the objective of determining whether any temporal relationships can be discerned which either confirm or disprove the implications of the external dating evidence. The availability of originals has been a limiting factor in regard to the evidence gathered in this survey of papers. Ideally, such a survey includes at least one exemplar of each signature, or “edition-sheet,” of each book printed during the proximate period, and multiple exemplars of many. The Huntington Library possesses only seventeen of the twenty-nine books printed by Orwin in 1591. Because of time restrictions, no attempt was made to examine several of the other twelve books at the Folger Library, where five additional copies of Complaints were examined. Hence, the sample covered in this survey is incomplete in the context of the ideal of examining the papers in every book printed during the proximate period. However, this fact does not detract from the validity of the present study because its purpose is testing a positive hypothesis, that is: the dedicatory date “this first of Januarie. 1591.” means the calendar year 1591 according to New Style dating. In practical terms, the hypothesis can be confirmed by demonstrating that exactly the same papers were used in both Daphnaida and Complaints. Thus the evidence found in the limited sample permits verification of the New Style date of Daphnaida. 8 A brief discussion of the evidence-inference relationship in the inductive method in the context of the uses of watermark evidence will clarfy this point. In the inductive method, the sign (i.e., positive, negative) and scope (or extent) of an inference is dependent upon the completeness of the sample from which the evidence is taken. In general, negative inferences are valid only in one circumstance—that the sample contains all the evidence that is relevant, in which case an inference is elevated to the level of a demonstrated conclusion. This limits the scope of a negative inference to statements about the sample itself and nothing more. In other words, the fact that paper A, found in other books of the proximate period, is not found in the target book can only support the inference “paper A does not appear in the target book.” Moreover, the inference is limited only to this copy of the edition and cannot be generalized to “paper A was not used in the printing of the edition.” In regard to inferences based upon evidence of papers (and typography as well), the vagaries of survival always eliminate the possibility of drawing negative inferences about a book or sequence of books. The extant samples of papers are always minuscule in proportion to the actual number of printed sheets in an edition: in the case of Complaints, for example, about sixty-nine whole copies are extant of an edition of unknown size, but undoubtedly consisting of five hundred or more copies. Even if the papers found in all sixty-nine copies were catalogued, it would be invalid to infer negatively that no other papers were used in the printing of the book. The discovery of a seventieth copy, or similarly, an examination of the many incomplete copies, could yield some entirely different watermarks. In this survey, for example, Folger STC23078 copy 3 revealed watermarks not seen in the Huntington copy and Folger copies 1 and 2. Similarly, if the books printed by Orwin in the period of January-April 1592 New Style were surveyed and none of the papers of Complaints were found, it would be invalid to infer that these papers were not used in that period one year later. In short, it can never be inferred that a given paper was not used in a book or in books of a period until every sheet that went thru the press has been examined—an impossible condition which clarifies the inherent limitation of the inductive method in regard to negative inferences. In contrast, positive inferences can be drawn when a single book or several books contain(s) the evidence that is necessary to demonstrate the truth of a positive hypothesis such as is stated above in regard to Complaints and Daphnaida. In this case, the appearance of exactly the same papers in both books demonstrates temporally proximate printing operations. This general principle arises from our knowledge about the paper supply system and about the various patterns of distribution of papers in books printed at roughly the same time in one shop, or in two or more shops in the case of shared printing. In regard to the distribution of papers in approximately contemporary books, the processing of papers in the printing house is of special significance. At paper collection and distribution centers on the continent, bulk lots of paper, either produced at a large paper factory or gathered from thousands of one-vat family operations in northern France, were assembled into quires of 24 or 25 sheets, then into reams of 20 quires containing 480 or 500 sheets respectively, of which 432 or 450 sheets were “good sheets”—the two end quires, or “chording quires,” were made up of defective sheets and took the brunt of the damage from the cords that were tied around the ream to hold it together. The reams were then assembled into bales, the final packaging unit for shipment to England. Paper merchants in London disassembled the bales into reams for sale and delivery to printers as job-lots which usually reflected the composition of the bales. However, instances are known in which the publisher (or printer) purchased a job-lot consisting of two different qualities, types, or sizes of paper with the objective of producing an edition consisting of two qualities of book, e.g., presentation copies, copies intended for marketing in expensive bindings, and copies for general marketing in tied-up packages. After delivery to the printer, the warehouse keeper combined the papers into the heap for use at the press during the next day's printing. In general, for economic reasons, printers ordered job-lots as the need arose rather than maintaining a standing stock of paper— the cost of the latter was far too prohibitive. 9 Throughout the process, batches of papers tended to remain together. As a result, the appearance of exactly the same paper or papers in two different editions (whether of the same work or of different works) constitutes evidence of the highest order of probability that the two editions were printed from the same job-lot of paper. In theory, two factors limit such inferences merely to the highest order of probability, that is, just short of absolute proof. During the packaging and unpackaging processes, a dissimilar sheet or quire or ream could have been combined with the predominant papers eventually found in a book. Similarly, given the variation in sizes of editions and numbers of sheets in each edition, the job-lots of paper (delivered to the printer in lots consisting of reams) required for one book or each of a sequence of books did not necessarily match exactly the number of reams found in a bale or sequence of bales from the continent. In such a situation, the merchant would include reams from a different bale or continental shipment to fill out a given order. This appears to have happened in the job-lot delivered to Orwin for Complaints where three “mixtures” of two kinds of papers appear (see later discussion). Finally, a printer could order papers for a work period without regard to the number of different books being machined then, e.g., a sufficient stock of papers to keep two presses at full operation for one week on two or more books in concurrent production. 10 Similarly, the processing of papers in the printing house could introduce dissimilar papers from another job-lot into a book. 11 Although the “usual” edition sizes mentioned by bibliographers, e.g., 500, 1000, 1250, 1500, do not work out to whole numbers of reams—for example, paper supplied from northern France usually consistend of reams of 450 “good” sheets—the warehouse keeper built the heap in “tokens” of 250 sheets consisting of ten quires, the hourly unit of production at the press. 12 The warehouse keeper had two options for producing the daily heap from the reams included in a job-lot of papers. Given the right correspondence between edition-size, the number of gatherings, and the number of reams in the job-lot, he could sequentially redistribute the 450-sheet reams into an even number of tokens over a sequence of days, and eventually exhaust the job-lot by the end of the printing of a book. 13 Otherwise, he would work the “left- overs” into the early heaps for the next printing job. Alternately, he could set aside one ream from which to draw the number of quires needed to “top off” a heap assembled from an even number of whole reams, e.g., two whole reams totaling 900 sheets plus four quires of 25 sheets each for an edition of a thousand copies. In a two-press shop such as Orwin's, concurrent printing on two presses increased both the complexity of the warehouse keeper's job and the possibility of the mixing of papers from different job-lots. In general, inferences about which method was used to build the heap are limited by the “tip of the iceberg” evidential situation noted earlier. Even a relatively large sample of an edition, e.g., twenty-one books, forty-five books, etc., may exhibit but a single example of an anomalous paper. However, the fact that the warehouse keeper built the heap from units of quires suggests that at least twenty-four other examples of that paper occurred in the whole edition. But that possibility is by no means a certainty. The warehouse keeper's duties included, in Moxon's terms, the process of “culling the chording quires” in search of “good” sheets. He held each sheet up to the light to determine whether it was totally useless or merely exhibited minor flaws which would not be noticeable in the interior gatherings of a book or after cropping once the book was bound. The usable sheets were then assembled into quires and added to the heap for the current job, or set aside until a complete quire was assembled. Since the chording quires contained a mixture of papers, it is possible that a single anomalous sheet is the only example of that paper in an edition. Several examples will be helpful in illustrating the resulting phenomena. In the case of the Jonson Folio of 1616, James A. Riddell has demonstrated that the small papers used in some of the final quires were used in printing the preliminaries, thereby establishing that sequence. Similarly, his charting of the watermarks in a large number of copies shows that, contrary to the accepted view, the printing of each sheet did not begin with large paper and finish on small paper, but rather, the next day's printing began on the same size as that which concluded the previous day's printing. 14 The two job-lots of paper (i.e., small and large papers) were clearly ordered upon the basis of accurate calculations which permitted the warehouse keeper to build the heap so that the desired proportions of small and large copies would result. He probably built the heap sequentially from alternating numbers of reams of large and small paper. George Eld's printing of Jonson's Sejanus (STC14782, 1605) represents another instance of two separate job-lots of paper being used in a single edition. Although the watermarks in only thirteen copies have been examined, a consistent distribution pattern obtains in which each book contains papers exclusively from one of the job-lots. One lot consists of inexpensive pott paper bearing the initials “BC” topped by a cluster of grapes. The other is a more expensive grade in two varieties of watermarks, the first consisting of the triple set of initials “IR AR| IP” topped by a crown-like design, the second a single “IAR” initial. Again, the warehouse keeper appears to have built the heap to specification. 15 The processing by the warehouse keeper produced distributions which can be useful in demonstrating concurrent production on two presses. For example, in his seminal study “New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence,” Allan Stevenson examined the watermark evidence found in three plays printed by Thomas Cotes in 1639/40— The Night-Walker, The Opportunitie, and The Coronation —in demonstrating that the latter two had to have been printed concurrently from a single job-lot of paper. In this instance, the sequence of watermarks through the books is virtually identical (see discussion 155-165). 16 Similarly, watermarks can demonstrate the sequential printing of two editions of one work or two separate works. In this case, the overlapping of papers provides the evidence, that is, varieties found in the final gatherings of the first edition appear in the early gatherings of the next edition. The watermarks in the first two editions of John Marston's The Malcontent Q1-2 (STC17479, 17480; 1604), for example, provide evidence both of sequence and concurrent shared printing in two shops. In both editions, primary printer Valentine Simmes printed F-H and A, while George Eld printed B-E. The sequence of papers in Q1 (a dozen extant copies) shows that both Eld's and Simmes's presses were fed from the same job-lot of paper on a daily basis. Furthermore, the sequence of editions exhibits an overlapping of papers. The watermark that first appears in the final sheet of Q1 printed by each printer also appears in their respective first sheets of Q2 (six extant copies). Finally, watermark evidence can in some instances either confirm or disprove external dating evidence such as that found in Stationers' Register entries, imprints, and dated dedications. For example, all three editions of The Malcontent bear the imprint date of 1604. However, correspondences between papers in the third edition and those found in proximate books in early 1605 demonstrate that the edition was printed in March 1605, and not in the period framed by the 5 July 1604 entry into the Stationers' Register. 17 Similarly, both editions of Robert Dallington's A Survey (STC6200, 6201) bear a 1605 imprint date and specify George Eld as the printer. The supposed first edition (STC6200) contains papers used in another 1607 book printed by Eld (Richard Parkes, An Apology STC 19259), pointing to a 1607 printing with a false imprint date of 1605. In short, the watermark evidence reverses the sequence of editions, and places the actual second edition (STC 6200) two years later than the imprint date of 1605. 18 These two cases are useful for demonstrating the difference between positive and negative inferences based upon paper evidence. In both cases, the inference can be stated negatively, e.g., The Malcontent Q3 was not printed in the 5 July 1604 period, A Survey Q1 was not printed in 1605. However, these negative inferences do not result from the paper evidence directly, e.g., since the papers from the two respective earlier dates do not appear, the books were not printed then. Rather, they are the opposite of the positive inferences which the paper evidence does prove, e.g. The Malcontent Q3 was printed in early 1605, A Survey Q1 was printed in 1607. In the absence of the papers which establish the later printing dates, no inference about dates could be drawn. Before proceeding to an analysis of the watermark evidence, it should be noted that the books surveyed in this study are divided into two groups for the sake of expedience. External evidence (eleven Stationers' Register entries and two dated dedications) permits a tentative dating of thirteen of the twenty-nine books printed by Orwin in 1591. This includes Daphnaida with its dedicatory date of “this first of Januarie. 1591.” Although the inclusion of Daphnaida in this group may seem illogical because its date is exactly what is in question, the fact is that every external date associated with the books in a paper survey must be considered tentative until the paper evidence demonstrates otherwise. As noted immediately above, the paper evidence can confirm the external dates in some cases, and disprove it in others. In many instances, the paper evidence does not contradict the external date, so we accept the date in good faith. In regard to the date of Complaints, the evidence is a bit more compelling than the “in good faith” situation. The “1590” imprint date in the title-page of Muiopotmos on T1 and the Stationers' Register entry date of 30 December 1590 can only mean the year 1590, regardless of Old Style or New Style dating. The “1591.” dates on the remaining three title-pages must, therefore, mean 1591 New Style—otherwise, a totally untenable proposition emerges, e.g., that the other three sections were printed a year later in January 1591 Old Style (1592 New Style) using exactly the same job-lot of papers. To return to the main issue, a statistical summary of the survey will provide a context for assessing the paper evidence which is relevant to the dating of Daphnaida. Nine of the thirteen tentatively datable books were examined. Two of the remaining four of those thirteen were entered early in the year (STC20588: 11 January, 2 sheets; STC22685: 4 February, 21 sheets) and their unavailability has created an unfortunate gap in the sense that the opportunity to stumble serendipitously across overlapping papers was eliminated. Even so, the survey includes the papers in seven tentatively datable books printed through May 1591 (113 edition-sheets); a total of 201 edition-sheets were identified in the nine tentatively datable books; seventeen additional sheets in second copies of Ivychurch STC11340 and Emmanuel STC11338.5 along with 115 sheets in five Folger copies of Complaints raised the total number of actual sheets to 333 in datable books. In addition, the survey included eight undatable books totaling 143 edition-sheets. Overall, the watermarks of 344 edition-sheets (476 actual sheets) were catalogued for the seventeen books. The twelve unexamined books contribute another 84 edition-sheets to the known output from Orwin's two-press shop in 1591. The sample consisting of 344 catalogued edition-sheets thus represents approximately 80% of the total output of 428 edition-sheets. 19 It can be noted that, in the context of the dating issue, the survey of books other than Complaints and Daphnaida seems, in a sense, gratuitous since it could never prove that these papers were used only in those two books. However, a contextual survey is desirable because a negative inference is never the objective of a paper survey. In practical terms, a survey often enough yields evidence leading to a positive inference about the temporal proximity of the printing of two or more books, especially in a situation like this. 20 Since active publishers like Ponsonby often ordered enough paper for an edition directly from a paper merchant rather than relinquishing this aspect of quality-control to the printer, the three books entered by Ponsonby early in the year were of special interest: The Countesses of Pembroke's Emmanuel STC11338.5 and The Countesse of Pembroke's Ivychurch STC11340, both entered 9 February 1591; and Complaints STC23078, entered 29 December 1590, but bearing both 1590 and 1591 imprint dates. 21 Along with Daphnaida, these four books constitute the “Ponsonby's books” subset of all the books printed by Orwin in 1591. In some such instances, the papers exhibit correspondences which indicate, at the least, delivery from a single London paper merchant, perhaps as a single order assembled at the warehouse from a single continental shipment. The watermark evidence found in Complaints and Daphnaida constitutes such a case. The accompanying chart shows the watermark distributions for three copies of Complaints and one copy of Daphnaida. Although Muiopotmos is the fourth section of Complaints, it appears as the first section to be printed, anticipating the typographical evidence discussed later. Two families of watermarks (as explained in note 8) appear. The “cuffed hand [or glove] pointing at star” designs are assigned identification numbers, while the “initialed pot [or vase]” designs are identified by the inscribed initials, or in instances where the initials are undecipherable, simply by “P2” (i.e., “pot 2”) and “P3”. Although five Folger copies were examined, only copies 1 and 2 are shown: time restrictions prevented accurately identifying the “hand-star” papers found in all sheets of Folger copy 3 except for A (where the “IB” pot appears), and those appearing in the mixtures in Folger copies 4 and 5.

In general, the nine designs are very similar and hence difficult to distinguish in marks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; marks 4, 7, and 8 are characterized by a very deep hollow where the thumb joins the palm; and mark 9 is distinguished by widely spaced fingers. In regard to the second family of “initialed pot/vase” watermarks, the progress of this study provides an illuminating example of the principle noted earlier, namely, no final conclusion can ever be reached regarding the actual number of different papers used in a book unless every book in the edition could be examined, an impossibility. Prior to examining the Folger copies, the following sentences appeared at this point in an earlier draft of this study: The fact that sheet A exhibits a totally unrelated design, a “one-handle vase with ornate lid, inscribed with the initials `IB'” appears to suggest that a separate supply was ordered for the front title sheet, but this is illusory. Further, it is possible that, if the 69 or so complete extant copies noted by Johnson were examined, the “IB” pot design would appear elsewhere in the book. As the chart shows, the “IB” “initialed pot/vase” design does appear in other copies, and furthermore, four other vase designs supplement the dominant “hand-star” watermarks. So, examining the remaining sixty-nine copies could produce yet more watermarks as well as modifying the apparent pattern of distribution. At this point, the evidence from just six books yields three copies (Huntington, Folger copies 1 and 3) which exclusively use the “hand-star” family of watermarks except in sheet A, two copies which exhibit a roughly even mixture of “hand-star” and vase papers (Folger copies 4 and 5), and one copy (Folger 2) which contains a large majority of vase papers with only three “hand-star” papers in the remaining sheets. In four of the copies, the “IB” vase can be identified in sheet A, and probably is the same seen in the other two exemplars of sheet A. In short, the six copies exhibit an unbroken pattern of the “IB” or other pot/vases in sheet A. The distribution patterns in the remaining sheets consist either of exclusive “hand-star” papers, or mixtures in varying proportions with vase papers. The sample is simply not large enough to draw any inferences about the composition of the papers in the job-lot other than to conclude that at least two families of papers were included, and in some copies, one family was used exclusively except in sheet A. Three anomalies occur. In the Folger copy 3 (all “hand-star”), sheet A is composed of two half-sheets, with the “IB” vase appearing in A2/3. A totally unrelated paper appears in A1/4 bearing a largely undecipherable inscription (possibly “L[u,e?]nto Mor[o?]” which has a tantalizing ring to it) of the kind that is frequently found in larger sizes of paper. Next, the first gathering of section 3 ( Prosopopoia, sheet L) in the Folger copy 2 is made up of one half-sheet exhibiting the “P2” watermark in L2/3. However, the base of the “RB” vase appears in L1, but the crest is not discernible in L4. Two factors deflect the suspicion that L1 and L4 are not conjugate: (1) although the chain lines do not match exactly in the gutter of L1/L4, the spacing of the chain lines as a whole is erratic, and the variations in spacings could be attributable to the length of the paper that is buried in the binding gutter; (2) in two other instances (O1/O4 and S2/S3), the crest and base respectively appear without the other half of the watermark, but chain line measurements coincide with conjugacy nonetheless. So, in the final analysis, L4 may be conjugate with L1. A third anomaly occurs in Folger copy 2. Sig. Q1 exhibits the fingers of the “hand-star” watermark #4, but is not conjugate with Q4; and Q2/3 are conjugate and exhibit the “GG” vase watermark. The rest of the sheets in Folger copy 2 are whole. As is usual, it is difficult to define the exact reason for these anomalies: numerous possibilities have been inferred in other studies. Nonetheless, they do demonstrate that an effort was made to salvage the good portions of damaged sheets. Again, the sample does not allow inferring that this occurred only in the context of copies containing mixtures of the two families of watermarks. To return to the central question, the evidence does demonstrate that the Huntington copy of Daphnaida was printed on three papers identical to those found in the complete Complaints (i.e., all four sections), or, in other words, on papers from the same job-lot. Given the dedication date three days after the entry of Complaints and the sharing of the papers, the conclusion that Daphnaida was printed in close temporal proximity with Complaints is inescapable. Furthermore, the paper evidence found in the two other books printed by Orwin for Ponsonby in early 1591 indicates that they also were temporally proximate to Complaints and Daphnaida. Papers identical to those in Complaints and Daphnaida appear in Ponsonby's next two books, Ivychurch (copy 1 = Huntington shelfmark 59822; copy 2 = 59746) and Emmanuel (copy 1 = 59823; copy 2 = 59747) in the following sheets: Ivychurch (copies 1 and 2) Emmanuel (copies 1 and 2) #1: A, C #3: D, G #3: B #4: D, I, M #4: C #5: L #6: A, K #9: M #9: M Three additional “hand-star” designs appear in Ivychurch and Emmanuel, yielding a total of nine watermarks which appear in these two books, six of which also appear in Complaints and two in Daphnaida. Overall, thirteen different identifiable “hand-star” watermarks appear in the four books. The sharing of identical papers in the four books leaves no doubt whatever that a single job-lot of paper containing the “hand-star” papers was used in the printing of the four books. 23 The conclusiveness of the evidence cannot be overstated. Further, it should be noted that the job-lot included a supply of vase papers that may also have been used in Ivychurch and Emmanuel, although no appearances were found in the four copies that were examined. It is reasonable to assume that, if a single job-lot of papers was purchased at one time for use in a sequence of four books, their printing had to be more or less temporally sequential—for instance, it would make no sense to claim that a publisher purchased a job-lot of papers that would be used in one book in January, two other books in February, then a fourth book in January of the next year. In this instance, the Stationers' Register entry dates of 30 December 1590 and February 1591 make it a virtual certainty that the four books were printed in close temporal proximity from one job-lot of paper. This inference can be confirmed by a reconstruction of the printing context of the proximate period. Reconstructing the production schedule of a specific period is, at best, a tentative process unless either external or internal evidence suggests and/or confirms the probable sequence and locations of all books produced during that period. Even then, the key variable is unknown, namely, the edition-size (i.e., number of copies printed) of each book, and in turn, the absence of that crucial fact forces the bibliographer to resort to inexact mathematical techniques such as deriving averages for weekly production rates based upon the known annual output from a shop. However, the averaging technique has the advantage of leveling the short-term variations in production that could arise from any number of causes. For example, periods of very low production or total inactivity could result from the lack of sufficient work to keep Orwin's two presses in full operation. In addition, since the early hand-press was prone to various problems, work stoppages were a matter of course. In terms of edition-size, it was possible to print and perfect two edition-sheets of an edition of 500 copies in one work-day, given the usual daily production rate of 1250 perfected sheets at the press. Whether this rate could be achieved in small editions depended entirely upon the rate at which the compositor could set type—it was virtually impossible if the text consisted of packed prose, but perhaps within reach in verse texts set in larger type such as the 94mm roman in stanzaic form with a lot of “white space” on each page, the kind of setting situation seen in Complaints and Daphnaida. On the other hand, an edition-sheet in a large edition of 1250 or 1500 would have inevitably required at least one day for printing and perfecting. So, in absence of exhaustive records such as were available for McKenzie's study of the Cambridge University Press, 24 it is virtually impossible to arrive at anything better than average figures about production rates during a specific period. Nonetheless, such figures are useful in determining whether, given the average production rate, a particular sequence of books could have been printed during a period. In the present case, the question is: do the books that can be assigned to the January-February period represent a “normal” rate of production as suggested by the weekly average? If so, it is reasonable to infer that the sequence was printed during the period as suggested by the external and internal dating evidence. Entry dates in the Stationers' Register locate six books in the period, and the watermark evidence demonstrates that Daphnaida belongs there as well. As noted earlier, the edition-sheet is the unit of production in terms of the output from the press. Although slightly less than half of the books (14/29) produced by Orwin in 1591 are datable, these seven books containing 72 edition-sheets can be assigned to the January-February period, and represent 17% of Orwin's known output of 428 edition-sheets for the year: Complaints STC23078, 30 December 1590, 23 sheets Daphnaida STC23079, 1 January 1591, 3 sheets A Consort of Creatures STC20588, 11 January 1591, 2 sheets [not checked] The Harmony of the Church STC7199, 1 February 1591, 6 sheets A Preparative to Marriage STC22685, 4 February 1591, 21 sheets [not checked] Emmanuel STC11338.5, 9 February 1591, 5 sheets Ivychurch STC11340, 9 February 1591, 12 sheets Given the fact that Orwin owned two presses, the average production rates can be calculated on the basis of the known annual output and the six-day work-week totaling about 300 days per year (365 days less 52 Sundays and the two weeks of vacation during Christmas and Easter holidays). For 428 sheets and two presses, then, Orwin's production rate amounts to 8.4 sheets per week, and probably slightly more than half of that for a single press at full operation (two workers—pressman and beater). 25 If the 28 sheets of Complaints, Daphnaida, and Consort were printed during January, the production rate figures to roughly 7 sheets per week. Assuming that the edition sizes were such as required a full day at the press for each sheet, a single press could have done the job with several sheets spilling over into February, but the annual average production rate suggests that Orwin, on the whole, did not employ the single press production method. Thus, given the average weekly production rate for the year, it seems clear that Orwin's two presses were concurrently in operation during the period according to Orwin's probable production method. As implied earlier, a reconstruction of the printing schedule requires terminal dates for the given period. In this case, the four books entered in early February provide the terminus for January, but no subsequent books were entered until 30 April. The printing of the 44 sheets in those four books obviously did not require three months. Similarly, the 51 sheets of the 30 April entry (STC11097) and the 13 sheets of the 12 May entry (STC21057) did not keep Orwin's two presses busy until the next entry on 3 August (STC5590). The 82 sheets of that book required about 10 weeks at the average rate, but the next entry (STC24913) occurs on 8 November, some thirteen weeks later. Overall, 224 sheets occur in the tentatively datable books, or 52% of the total output of 428 sheets. The remaining undatable 48% of the sheets (including one long book of 78 sheets, STC25626), then, would have been printed in the “gaps.” Most of the undatable books are short and of the kind that could be “squeezed” into the schedule. Regardless, it seems clear that the dates of the January-February books correspond to what could be reasonably expected of concurrent production on two presses at the average weekly rate of 8.4 sheets. In short, Ponsonby's four books were in all probability printed in the sequence indicated by the dates in a nearly continuous operation of the kind that characterized that method of production. Ponsonby apparently planned the four books as a single project and purchased the job-lot of paper in advance. The end result is the extensive sharing of papers among the four books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The second issue that must be settled is the printing sequence of the four sections of Complaints. Muiopotmos, the fourth section (T-Z), bears an imprint date of 1590, while the earlier three sections are all dated 1591. Various theories have been offered to explain this apparent anomaly. It is worth noting that, given the fact that Complaints was entered on 29 December 1590, it is not unlikely that a compositor setting up a title-page in 1590 would date it thus. But Johnson rejects the view that Muiopotmos was printed first, concluding that “the probable explanation of the date of Muiopotmos is that when the printer reached that point, he realized that the volume would be completed and ready for sale in 1590 (Old Style) instead of 1591, and changed the date on the title-page accordingly.” 26 Since Johnson's arguments have not been previously refuted, some discussion is necessary. First, Johnson correctly assumes that the continuous, unbroken sequence of signatures from A to Z demonstrates that the four sections were considered parts of a single volume from the outset. The beginning of a new alphabet for Daphnaida, conversely, probably indicates that it was not intended as part of the volume, although the fact that Complaints ends on Z creates some uncertainty: frequently enough, compositors begin a second alphabet in a single volume without doubling the signature (i.e., Aa, Bb, etc.). The fact that only three copies of Daphnaida are extant, one bound together with Complaints, is a clear enough indication that it was not considered part of the volume. However, the assumption that the continuous signing demonstrates that the Complaints was printed seriatim (i.e., sheet A, then B, then C, and so on to Z) overlooks the realities of textual processing in the Elizabethan printing house, particularly in regard to the different challenge presented in preparing for the press a prose manuscript as opposed to a verse manuscript. As Joseph Moxon explains at great length, the prose manuscript can present considerable difficulty in the process of casting-off, especially if the hand is uneven. Nonetheless, in describing three methods of casting-off copy, he assures the reader that a compositor is able to perform this complicated process with sufficient accuracy to estimate that 127 pages of manuscript copy containing 191,135 pieces of type (including both letters and spaces) would transfer into 123 quarto pages set in english (94mm) roman type, or fifteen sheets of paper with three type-pages remaining for the sixteenth sheet. 27 In contrast, a novice could cast-off a verse manuscript provided that he kept in mind that blank lines between stanzas had to be included in the count. The task of predicting the signatures of the three internal title-pages was rendered easier because of the editorial decision to place each on the recto of the first leaf of their respective sheets (or “gatherings”), leaving the verso blank. Similarly, each of the other texts begins on the recto side of a leaf. An experienced publisher's savvy is apparent in the grouping of poems which produced this attractive layout and yielded but one “wasted” type-page (X2 v was left blank so that Visions of the worlds vanitie could commence on X3 r ). In short, assuming that Ponsonby had not cast-off the manuscripts himself in arranging them into their final order (as he probably did), a compositor could have accomplished the necessary analysis in about an hour to determine that the title of Muiopotmos would occur on signature T1. As noted earlier, the placement of the internal title-pages on the recto of the first leaf of their respective gatherings probably resulted from a marketing strategy rather than purely aesthetic concerns; that is, the three internal sections could be marketed separately. Moreover, Johnson does not consider the implications of Orwin's ownership and use of two presses. In a one-press shop, “seriatim” can only mean two or more sheets in sequence, one after the other, usually accompanied by a distribution of the type from one or both formes of the previous sheet in order to replenish the cases for the setting of the first forme of the next sheet. However, in a two-press shop using the concurrent production method, work is shared between the two crews and presses. Hence, “seriatim” does not necessarily apply in its strict denotative sense. For example, Orwin could have assigned sheet A to press 1 to begin the job, but because the manuscript had been cast off, he was free to assign any other sheet to press 2. There was no compelling necessity to assign sheet B to press 2, nor did press 1 have to begin the job with sheet A. 28 Second, Johnson's assumption “on a priori grounds” that “the book was printed in... logical order” undergirds his interpretation of “the typographical make-up of the four title-pages” as the “key to the final solution of the problem.” He cites the movement of the “four hands” ornament and “London” upward in three steps from the crowded #1 title-page setting to the position in title-page #4 in arguing that, had the sections been printed in reverse order (i.e., #4, #3, #2, #1), “it seems most unlikely that the printer, having achieved a satisfactory spacing of the matter... in #4 and #3... would have quite unnecessarily disturbed this arrangement in #2.” Obviously, he overlooks the logical implication of his observation that the large amount of matter in #1 forced the crowding in the lower part of the compartment: this crowding was necessary regardless of whether #1 was printed first or last. In any event, the main problem is Johnson's failure both to visualize these spacing variations from a compositor's perspective and to appreciate the process of re-imposition. Such adjustments were unavoidable given the sequence of resettings and re-impositions. All of the type, including the blanks, in the upper portion of the compartment had to be removed and reset in the stick with the new texts, and then re-justified both horizontally and vertically each time it was imposed in the compartment formed by the vertical and horizontal rules abutting the four border pieces. 29 Consequently, the notion that a compositor would actually be concerned about preserving a “satisfactory spacing” ignores the simple reality that a given spacing could not be preserved in these circumstances even if the text reflected only a quite minimal change. Indeed, the compositor's primary concern was simply to pack the compartment space with types and blanks which, when locked up in the furniture, would firmly remain in place despite the downward thrust of the platen during the many hundreds of pulls on the bar. In short, the perception of a sequentially evolving layout is illusory. 30 Moreover, taken as physical evidence of changes in a typographical setting, spacing variations simply cannot prove sequence even when the changes occur during a single imposition. The direction of change is always ambiguous in itself: one state of the setting can be declared as the earlier setting (or, vice versa, the later setting) only if other evidence that is capable of demonstrating direction is present. 31 In reality, sequence can be proven conclusively only by progressive damage to an identifiable typographical entity such as an ornament, initial, border, rule, or type which reappears in a sequence of states of an impression or in a sequence of impositions. In this case, the imprint provides such typographical evidence. The first “r” in the pica roman setting of the line “Churchyard at the signe of” exhibits a few characteristic dents which can be observed at high magnification (30X) in all title-pages except #4 on T1 where it is nearly perfect. However, the “r” exhibits new damage which is observable even without magnification in title-page #3 on L1. Just below the junction with the shoulder the vertical member has been severely dented by a blow to the left side, producing a pronounced arc to the right of the vertical member. Similarly, the “a” in “at” is undamaged on T1, but the shoulder is battered downward toward the body on E1 and L1. In short, the title-page #3 (L1) was the last title-page to be printed. The order in which the title-pages #1 (A1) and #2 (E1) were printed cannot be determined conclusively, but the condition of the types on T1 indicates that it was first. Admittedly, this seems a quite strange method of printing a book. Nonetheless, when a group of key types is examined across six copies and consistently noted as “perfect” or “good” (i.e., no discernible damage), and these occur in the context of other identifiable types which indicate “same setting of types,” the evidence contradicts the logical expectation of what is normal. In conclusion, since Muiopotmos was not printed in the logical order suggested by the sequence of signatures, there seems little reason to reject the correspondence of the entry date and the “1590” imprint date for Muiopotmos as the external basis for confirming that it was printed first, with its title-page being set in 1590. 32</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Finally, the conclusions reached here upon the basis of bibliographical evidence clearly have implications in regard to Spenser's involvement in the publication of Complaints and Daphnaida. As Johnson notes, the painstaking stop-press corrections of errors in Complaints, especially those kinds not normally detected in printing-house proofing, certainly suggests that Spenser attended proof at Orwin's shop. Beyond that, Ponsonby's prefatory “The Printer to the Gentle Reader” and Spenser's dedication in Daphnaida suggest that Spenser and Ponsonby worked together on the preparation of the materials for the press. Given the fact that the dedication to Daphnaida is dated shortly after the printing of Complaints commenced, it is difficult to reject the proposition that Spenser wrote the dedication as part of the publication process and personally delivered Daphnaida to Ponsonby. The latter is certainly suggested by Ponsonby's two references to Spenser as a source of manuscript materials. In both references, Ponsonby's comments shed light on the dynamics involved in the competitive coexistence of print and manuscript cultures in the period. Motivated by the recent success of The Faerie Queene, Ponsonby notes that he has undertaken the project of collecting Spenser's poems: “to get into my handes such smale Poemes of the same Authors; as I heard were disperst abroad in sundry handes, and not easie to bee come by, by himselfe....” While the manuscript dissemination of works certainly presented an opportunity for unscrupulous publishers (like Henry Olney) to intercept copies and publish them without authorial permission or involvement, Ponsonby's difficulty lies in his inability (or lack of luck) in tracking down manuscripts. 33 Two problems are apparent. First, the implication seems clear that, while in Ireland, Spenser had been inaccessible as a source of manuscripts of the shorter poems. A second problem arises because of the non-return of manuscripts lent by Spenser before he went to Ireland to individuals wishing to take copies: “some of them having bene diverslie embizeled and purloyned from him, since his departure over Sea.” Ponsonby deliberately chooses particularly negative language here, perhaps to tweak the consciences of those holding such manuscripts. This seems the only reasonable interpretation of Ponsonby's “indictment” since it is difficult to believe that Spenser would lend out his sole autograph copy of a work. It seems natural that he would have kept a personal copy of each, delivering a fair-copy to a dedicatee or lending it to a friend. Nonetheless, Ponsonby's ultimate objective in making the claim is clearly to flush out such materials from their unknown whereabouts. The present collection of poems in Complaints in fact, has been assembled from such sources: these, Ponsonby notes, “I have by good meanes gathered togeather” and “caused to bee imprinted altogeather, for that they all seem to containe like matter....” His choice of the term “good meanes” seems deliberate, verifying to readers that the manuscripts were gathered legally and published with the author's permission. 34 His prior relationship with Spenser as publisher of The Faerie Queene would, of course, lend legitimacy to his attempt to acquire manuscripts of Spenser's other poems. And there is no reason to doubt that Spenser approved since he provided Daphnaida. The second reference to Spenser implies as much. Ponsonby promises to publish other poems that he has heard of, “which when I can either by himselfe, or otherwise attaine too, I mean likewise for your favour sake to set foorth.” Spenser here ranks as the primary source. Whether Spenser provided the dedications at this time for the other works is unclear. An anomaly in the dedication to Virgil's Gnat might suggest that he did. The other dedications are titled simply “Dedicated to....” The former, however, contains a historical note regarding the time when Spenser initially dedicated the work: “ Virgils Gnat. | Long since dedicated| To the most noble and excellent Lord, | the Earle of Leicester, late| deceased.” The note may simply be a clarification of the fact that the dedication preceded Leicester's death in 1588, since the remaining dedications are to living persons. But it seems highly unlikely that a publisher, even one of Ponsonby's calibre, would care about such a distinction-it is an author's kind of comment. Furthermore, it is the only instance of the intrusion of an editorial voice: otherwise the texts are presented without editorial comment. Spenser's attention to the potential significance of dedications, however, is well attested to elsewhere. It would not be surprising to find that he inserted this historical note while proofing Ponsonby's manuscript, or perhaps, when he wrote the dedication for the printing. In short, it seems reasonable to conclude that Spenser worked along with Ponsonby on the preparation of these materials for the press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* I wish to acknowledge the assistance of Cyndia Clegg (Pepperdine University) in gathering collation data for the books that I was unable to examine. 1 Jean R. Brink, “Dating Spenser's `Letter to Ralegh,'” The Library, 6th ser., 16 (1994), 219-224. 2 Francis Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser Printed before 1700 (1933; facsim. rpt. 1966), 24-28. 3 This process of folding by the bookseller and/or binder is not to be confused with that described by Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing (1683-4 ), ed. Herbert Davis and Harry Carter (1962), 317-320, including Plate 33 showing the warehouse keeper at the standing press kept by printers solely for the purpose of “pressing” the newly collated or gathered books. This first stage of folding as described by Moxon has as its objective the production of stable stacks of collated and once-folded books that will remain in place on the bed of the press as the platen is tightened by the warehouse keeper's pull on the bar. The purpose of this stage had nothing to do with the fold in the collated books. Rather, it was necessary to leave the stacks of books on the press at full pressure “about a Day and a Night” in order to reverse the deep embossing in the sheets that occurred during printing. As the platen of the printing press forced the damp paper down onto the imposed forme, the paper stretched down around the edges of the letterpress. Recall that the tympan which lay between the sheet and the platen was faced with a wet cloth for perfecting sheets (see Moxon 63-64, 306-307). The surface of the type-pages determined the limit of the platen's downward motion, during which motion the cloth was severely compressed. However, the cloth surrounding the imposed type-pages, or in the “margin” area of the printed sheet, pushed the unprinted portion of the sheet far below the surface of the type-pages. One extant unpressed copy of a book exhibits an embossing depth of about 3/32″ to ⅛″! Each individual letter likewise was embossed, i.e., the damp sheet stretched down around the face of each piece of type until it (usually) reached the type-shoulder. Pressing, in short, was required to eliminate the embossing. The second folding and collation noted in the text occurred at the bookseller and/or binder. If packaged by the bookseller, the packet was usually held together loosely by thread stitched perpendicularly through the plane of the gathered sheets. The binder's stitching, of course, went through the gutter of the spine fold. 4 For discussion of the concept of bibliographical encoding by means of graphic layout, see pp. 91-94 in Adrian Weiss, “Shared Printing, Printer's Copy, and the Text(s) of Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres ” (hereafter “Shared Printing”), Studies in Bibliography, 45 (1992), 71- 104. 5 For discussion, see pp. 187-191 in Adrian Weiss, “Bibliographical Methods for Identifying Unknown Printers in Elizabethan/Jacobean Books” (hereafter “Identifying Unknown Printers”), Studies in Bibliography, 44 (1991), 183- 228. 6 Until recently, ornamental stock (i.e., ornamented initials, compartments such as found on the four title-pages of Complaints ) and printer's devices (such as Orwin's identifying piece containing the initials “TO” [device 273a in R. B. McKerrow, Printers' and Publishers' Devices in England and Scotland, 1485-1640 (1939)] which appears in the title- page of Daphnaida ) provided the primary evidence of a shop. However, the very common practice of borrowing ornamental stock introduces a degree of unreliability into the use of ornamental evidence (for further discussion, see Weiss, “Identifying Unknown Printers,” 191-203). Notwithstanding, Johnson has traced the six ornaments and title-page compartment in Complaints to other books produced by Orwin (28); the compartment can be noted also in STC11338.5, STC11340, STC11341, STC17087, and STC17049. However, a printer is most reliably identified by his typefonts, and especially by the re-appearance of identifiable damaged types in several books which provides conclusive evidence of his involvement. The ownership of a given typefont is established by a survey of books from the shop during the proximate period in which the target book was printed (for further discussion, see Weiss, “Identifying Unknown Printers,” 203-213). In this case, the fact that Complaints and Daphnaida are bound together in the Huntington copy permitted ready confirmation that the same 94mm roman typefont was used in the texts of both (and as text-font in STC3908.6 as well); this particular typeface is not unique to Orwin's shop, but it occurs in combination with other typefaces found in his other books. However, the make-up of the pica roman typefont, represented by but a few letters in the title-pages of the two books, is unique to Orwin's shop. In Complaints the font sets “By ED. SP. ” and “Churchyard at the signe of”; it sets only “Ar-| thure Gorges” in Daphnaida. The base typeface is identifiable from these letters as the C2-hybrid with a low-riding “G” and wrong-face Haultin (i.e., “Y-face”) “a” (for further discussion, see Adrian Weiss, “Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: the Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors,” Studies in Bibliography, 43 [1990], 95-164). Complete samples as text-font occur in several 1591 books including STC18138, STC24913, STC11338.5, STC11340, and STC24913; and as emphasis-font in STC11868, STC21057, STC5590 and others. 7 For discussion of this method of analysis, see Weiss, “Shared Printing,” 81-89. 8 Papers are identified by the watermark formed in the paper by a graphic design woven into the paper mould with fine wire (for description and illustrations see Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography [1972; corr. 1974], 58). In addition, the “chain lines,” or the fine wires stretched at slightly irregular intervals across the short axis of the mold, also provide a means of identifying paper (see Allan Stevenson, “Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence,” Studies in Bibliography, 6 [1954], 181- 195; and David L. Vander Meulen, “The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad, ” Studies in Bibliography, 37 [1984], 58-81). The almost infinite variety of watermarks found during the period are classified into “families” on the basis of the similarity of the designs. As an aid to identification, bibliographers have published collections of tracings. The seminal collection is Charles M. Briquet's Les Filigranes, which contains over 16,000 tracings (the original edition of 1907 was edited by Allan Stevenson for the Paper Publications Society's edition of 1968); other scholars such as Edward Heawood have added to the published resources available to scholars (see “Sources of Early English Paper-Supply,” The Library, 4th ser., 10 [1929-1930], 427-454; and “Papers Used in England after 1600,” The Library, 4th ser., 11 [1929-1930], 263-299, 466-498). Although G. Thomas Tanselle requires that the bibliographer's “basic research” must include checking the target papers against those found in the numerous collections (see p. 51 in “The Bibliographical Description of Paper,” Studies in Bibliography, 24 [1971], 27-67), I have never found even a close match in the collections to any of the upwards of one thousand watermarks that I have traced or sketched. So, novice students of watermarks should feel no frustration with similar results. Nonetheless, Tanselle's suggestion is still valid because an awareness of the incredible variety of designs is essential, and the identification of the “family” to which a watermark belongs is established by reference to Briquet's classifications. “Pot” or “vase” designs build on a basic symmetrical or asymmetrical vase shape, with one or two handles, with or without a spout and ornamented lid, and often bearing the initials of the mould-maker or the paper-maker. Similarly, the family consisting of the “gloved-hand” design comes in a large variety—some with ornate lacey cuffs, some with the middle finger tied to (“pointing at”) stars or clovers via a single wire emanating from the finger, and so on. Another very common design consists of two opposing watermarks connected by a single wire—the designs include three- and four-leaf clovers, hearts, and other circular shapes. In general, a job-lot of papers ordered for a specific book consists either of (1) a homogeneous group of papers (a single watermark throughout or several closely related, but not identical, watermarks), or (2) a heterogeneous collection of papers unrelated by watermark design. At times, remnant papers left over from one book are used in the next book and constitute valuable evidence of dating sequence. However, the job-lots used in successive books are usually distinct and exclusive (i.e., appear only in the book for which the paper was purchased). For further discussion, see Weiss, “Shared Printing,” 79-80 and notes 13-14. One common source of confusion should be clarified at this point. References to “cheap pott paper” are encountered frequently enough in bibliographical literature and can be misinterpreted as specifying papers containing the “pot” design. However, the size of the paper is actually what is meant—the use of the term “pott paper” to denote size and quality probably arose because of the fact that cheap papers frequently contain pot or vase designs, but many other families of designs also appear in the “pott paper” size—all of the watermarks mentioned in this study, for example, occur in pott-size paper with the possible exception of the anomalous half-sheet at A1/4 of the Folger copy 3. For details about paper sizes and names, see Tanselle, “The Bibliographical Description of Paper,” 39. 9 For instance, the 1588 inventory of Cambridge printer Thomas Thomas's paper stock lists odd reams of various papers amounting to a few shillings each. One item consists of 39 reams of the widely used, inexpensive, pott paper whose value is assessed at £8, an enormous amount of money (see John Morris, “Thomas Thomas, Printer to the University of Cambridge 1583-8. Part II: Some Account of his Materials and Bookbindings with a Short-title List of his Printing,” Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 4 [1964-68], 340). But Thomas's situation was unique: he had to order and have his paper shipped from London. It stands to reason that, in order to commence printing new jobs in a timely fashion, he had to have a standing stock of paper. The logical choice was pott paper. Given the 17,550 sheets in the 39 reams, he had sufficient stock to complete an edition of 1250 copies of a book with 14 edition-sheets (sigs. A-O). If a longer book in the same size of edition was undertaken, he had slightly more than two weeks to order and have the paper shipped from London. As the edition-size decreases, the size of the book increases (e.g., 1000 copies, 17.5 edition-sheets, sigs. A-R; 750 copies, 23.4 edition-sheets, sigs. A-Z, and so on), as does the lead-time for delivery of new paper stock. In contrast, London printers could acquire paper as it was needed. 10 Bibliographers have tended to think of paper-supply exclusively in terms of job-lot per book. The alternate approach noted here, i.e., papers ordered by work period, makes business sense from a printer's perspective because of the cash-flow situation, especially in regard to longer books. We do not know the specifics of the payment scheduling in the period—whether all or a percentage payment was required up-front, or payments per period with a final payment when the job was finished, or just what approach was followed. Specific details about one transaction that is based upon period payments is found in Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1576-1602—from Register B, ed. W. W. Greg and E. Boswell (1930), 51. On 7 April 1595, ten partners contracted with Peter Short to finish the fifth edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs after John Denham's death. Payment to the work crew was made weekly. In regard to the paper, a certain ambiguity is present: “The seid [partners] as [party] thereof are to disburse the money quartelye that shalbe due for the paper.” It is unclear whether payment in advance of the quarterly expenditure, or later for the actual expenditure, is meant. It is difficult to believe that Short had the capital for purchasing a quarter's worth of paper, especially since very expensive paper rated at 7 shillings per ream (pott papers = 4 shillings) is involved. This would amount to an enormous capital investment. On the other hand, there is no doubt that, at times, publishers did in fact order a job-lot of paper for a specific book, presumably paying the paper merchant directly. 11 See Moxon 320-322 for a detailed description of the warehouse keeper's procedure for building the heap. 12 See Moxon 484-486 and Donald F. McKenzie, “Notes on Printing at Cambridge c. 1590,” Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 3 (1959), 101-102, for discussion of the evidence supporting this rather incredible production rate—note that it is approximately the same speed as a four page-per-minute laser printer! 13 For example, assuming an edition size of 750 copies, the paper-flow requires five reams of paper per three printed edition-sheets. The cyclical pattern for each sequence of three edition-sheets is: #1: ream-1 (450 sheets) + ream-2 (300 sheets) = 750 sheets, 150 sheets remaining; #2: ream-2 (150 sheets) + ream-3 (450 sheets) + ream-4 (150 sheets) = 750 sheets, 300 sheets remaining; #3: ream-4 (300 sheets) + ream-5 (450 sheets) = 750 sheets. The cycle is then repeated for the next three edition-sheets, and so on. If the book does not extend to a full final cycle, remnants will remain from the final ream. 14 See James A. Riddell, “The Concluding Pages of the Jonson Folio of 1616,” Studies in Bibliography, 47 (1994), 147-154. 15 I should stress that the limited sample of thirteen copies prevents reaching the level of certainty represented by Riddell's massive cataloguing of watermarks in the Folio. In regard to author-involvement in the details of production, Jonson's direct involvement in the printing of the Folio has long been recognized. However, I do not recall any suggestion that he attempted to control other aspects of production such as the selection of papers. A similarity between the paper distributions in the Folio and Sejanus certainly raises that possibility. In regard to the latter, John Jowett has demonstrated that Johnson's involvement in the printing extended to a deliberate manipulation of the graphic layout and typography in order to create a synergetic relationship between lexical and bibliographical texts in which the latter continually limits and/or defines the former (see “The 1605 Quarto of Sejanus, ” Text: Transactions of the Society for Textual Scholarship, 4 [1988], 279-296; and “Jonson's Authorization of Type in Sejanus and other Early Quartos,” Studies in Bibliography, 44 [1991], 254-265). It is worth noting that the imprint is spelled “Ellde” in some copies and “Elld.” in others. This probably indicates a stop-press title-page correction rather than a longer interruption of printing. The significant fact is that both spellings occur in the context of the initialed papers in copies 25.A.81 and 25.A.82 of the Dyce Collection. A full analysis of the printing of the quarto is yet to be done. Incidentally, the RSTC notes, in error, that “both” Dyce copies read “Ellde”; in fact, copies 25.A.80 and 25.A.82 read “Elld.” while copy 25.A.81 reads “Ellde”. 16 “New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence,” Studies in Bibliography, 1 (1948-49), 149-182. This study is quite valuable in regard to its information about papers and details of presswork and is the starting point for any study of watermarks. However, Stevenson's reconstruction of the printing sequence must be approached with extreme caution. Most importantly, the assumption that a paper distribution in just six or seven copies of a book can be extrapolated to the whole edition of 1500 is simply invalid and false in the context of the principles of statistics. Hence, it is impossible to claim that, to cite just one example, “sheet B used three tokens of 750 sheets each of IHS and pot paper” (159). Many other instances of such inferences must be dismissed as well. Likewise, inferences cannot be drawn about the ratio of corrected to uncorrected states in a given sheet based upon the evidence in a few copies. Overall, the reconstruction is a virtuoso performance, but the accuracy and precision of its description of presswork is simply an illusion. 17 The details of the watermark evidence and printing history of the three editions of The Malcontent will be presented in a later study. 18 See discussion, “Identifying Unknown Printers,” 222. For discussion of “dated” watermarks, i.e., those inscribed with a date, as evidence, see W. W. Greg's classic study “On Certain False Dates in Shakespearian Quartos,” The Library, n.s., 9 (1908), 113-131, 381-409. 19 Production figures for printing shops are hard to come by and usually vary widely from year to year. Furthermore, given the widespread practice of shared printing, these figures often overlook unidentified sections by a given printer in shared books bearing the imprint of other shops. For example, Orwin printed the first edition of Henry Smith's A Preparative for Marriage (entered 4 February) STC22685 for Thomas Man, who then had Richard Field print the second and third editions and hired John Charlewood for the fourth edition (STC22687), but either Charlewood or Mann gave the second part of the edition (2A-L) to Orwin for printing. Charlewood's imprint heads the book. Whether sections by Orwin lie hidden in other books is not known. Hence, “total” in the context of shop production is synonymous with “known” or “identified.” Overall, it is clear that Orwin functioned as a trade printer producing, for the most part, shorter books for other publishers although he entered a large number of items himself in 1591. He produced only three large books (50 pages or more) in 1591. Of course, edition sizes are the unknown variables in dealing with shop production levels. Whether STC5590 (82 edition-sheets) was an edition of 500 or 1500 copies make a great deal of difference in this context. For the sake of completeness, the twenty-nine books from 1591 are here categorized with the number of edition-sheets in each. At this point, data is lacking for STC15644, a religious work entitled “A short and plaine instruction, for such as are carefull to know the way to everlasting life.” The groups are as follows: (1) Examined, datable (9). 23078 (29 Dec. 1590), 23; 23079 (1 Jan.), 3; 7199 (1 Feb.), 6; 11338.5 (9 Feb.), 12; 11340 (9 Feb.), 5; 11097 (30 Apr.), 51; 21057 (12 May) 13; 5590 (3 Aug.), 82; 24913 (8 Nov.), 6. (2) Examined, undatable ( 8 ). 3908.6, 10; 5457, 4; 11821, 9; 14644, 16; 16657, 12; 17049, 7; 17087, 7; 26626, 78. (3) Unexamined, datable ( 5 ). 20588 (11 Jan.), 2; 22685 (4 Feb.), 21; 19120.3 (Nov.), 1; 11868; (6 Dec.), 13; 22687 (Dec.), 11. (4) Unexamined, undatable ( 7 ). 3059.2, 1; 10233, 2; 15644, 4.5; 19710, 2; 19753, 19; 19916.7, 10; 22703.5, 1. 20 I should note that a contextual survey is often more necessary than might first appear in attempting to settle a dating issue. This arises from the fact that some papers were extremely common in specific short periods of time because of the source and nature of continental shipments. Hence, the appearance of identical watermarks in two or more books in the proximate period under question initially might appear to settle a dating issue, but by extending the survey to books beyond the proximate period, other appearances could emerge which dilute or destroy the cogency of the evidence. For example, the papers used in Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres are used in 1572-74 exclusively in thirteen other books printed by Henry Bynneman, and then again in the second edition The Posies (1575) as well as in many of sharing printer Henry Middleton's books. See “Shared Printing,” 79-80 and note 14. 21 For a comprehensive discussion of Ponsonby's activities as a publisher, see Michael Brennan, “William Ponsonby: Elizabethan Stationer,” Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography, 6-7 (1982-83), 91-110. 22 A tenth watermark may occur in Folger copy 2 in sig. I4, where just a portion of a cuff can be discerned. However, although sigs. I1 and I4 appear to be conjugate, no portion of a watermark is evident in I1. But sigs. I2 and I3 are conjugate. Perhaps this is another anomalous gathering along with those noted below. 23 Significantly, a similar correspondence obtains in two undatable books printed in 1591 by Orwin for W. Broome. John Lyly's Campaspe STC17049 and Sapho &amp; Phao STC17087 share a “hand pointing at a clover” paper in three instances. “Hand- star” papers appear in two other books: Florio's Second Fruites STC11097 is printed on a job- lot of “hand” papers, a few with “stars,” others without “stars,” and several unrelated “hands”; only those “hand-star” papers in sheets G and H of the undatable A Work Worth the Reading STC11821 resemble the Ponsonby job-lot but are distinctly different in many design aspects. Since three books published by Ponsonby in 1592 were available, the 43 edition-sheets in them were examined. STC18138 (1 April) and STC13466 (3 May) were printed on different job-lots of common “initialed pots.” STC25117 (10 November) was printed on extremely coarse papers with pot designs and one extremely strange mark which can be described as a “crown opposing a six-line rack mounting six arrows which, together, form a grid.” 24 See D. F. McKenzie, The Cambridge University Press 1696-1712: A Bibliographical Study, 2 vols. (1966). 25 Interestingly enough, Orwin's two-press average production rate, if halved, approximates the one-press rate of Nicholas Okes's shop during the period in which Lear was printed (see Peter W. M. Blayney, The Texts of King Lear and Their Origins [1982], 63). 26 Brink cites the scholarship showing that publishers and printers used New Style dating consistently (221, and notes 6-9). Further, Brink cites five examples of Ponsonby's use of New Style dates for books entered in November and December which bear an imprint date of the subsequent year, but were surely completed and marketed before March 25. Johnson's inconsistency in reverting to Old Style dating to explain away the 1590 date while arguing for New Style dating of Daphnaida should be noted. Furthermore, given the process of casting-off (see later discussion) and the probability that Orwin actually kept a schedule of contracted jobs, he would have known from the outset that the 23 sheets of Complaints would be completed in far less time than nearly four months. Johnson here seems to believe that printers took in a manuscript, commenced setting type without planning ahead, and found out only by hindsight that a particular job took a certain amount of time. Even if that were Orwin's aproach, he could not possibly have misjudged the printing time by two months. 27 See Moxon 239-244. Similarly, mastery of the casting-off process enabled compositors to utilize time-saving methods of setting type-pages out of sequence, namely, setting “by formes” and “by halves.” The process created bibliographical evidence of a kind that is possibly unique to the textual problems encountered in Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres (see Weiss, “Shared Printing,” 100-103). 28 For example, the printing of sections in an out-of-order sequence has been demonstrated in both the Shakespeare First Folio and the Jonson Folio of 1616. See Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare, 2 vols. (1963); and James A. Riddell, “The Printing of the Plays in the Jonson Folio of 1616,” Studies in Bibliography, 49 (1996), 149-168. 29 Nor did the adjustments present any special difficulty. The changes in vertical spacings were a quite simple matter of setting the roman pica “London” line flush atop the 16-point line “Imprinted...” in #1; in #2, a series of spaces (blanks) laid on their sides horizontally has been added; in #3 and #4, the process was repeated. Regardless of sequence of settings, the process was a standard, almost automatic, psycho-motor task performed routinely by the compositor. It should also be noted that the claim of “identical” spacings in #3 and #4 is not accurate. Even though the first nine lines of types (including two blanks) are reset in exactly the same respective typefonts, the vertical spacings are not exactly the same. The process of driving home the quoins in sequence during lock-up produced differing amounts of vertical thrust which caused lines 7-9 to bow quite differently in the horizontal plane in the two title-pages. Lockup similarly caused the top woodcut border of the compartment on A1 to shift considerably to the left. 30 Beyond that, Johnson overlooks the possible relevance of the texts of the title-pages to the layout changes in going from #3 (L1) and #4 (T1) to #1 (A1) and #2 (E1). L1 and T1 both contain a reference to the dedicatee. A1 actually has no space for any such reference. When setting E1, the compositor compensated for the great amount of white space caused by the absence of either the full title of A1 or the dedication references of L1 and T1 by setting the first word “THE” in the popular 40-point Haultin titling-font. Similarly, Teares of the Muses is set in a larger font—the Guyot 20-point roman. Nonetheless, E1 exhibits a relatively large amount of “white space.” On the other hand, the largest type used on L1 and T1 is 94mm italic and roman. The direction of change, as usual, is open to question, but the setting of E1 can most reasonably be explained as a compositor's solution to a problem caused by a lack of sufficient material to achieve an aesthetic balance between the heavy ornateness of the borders and “white space” in the compartment. The removal of the title-text of A1 would have caused that problem, and if the printing sequence placed A1 after L1 and T1, the original setting strategy of including the dedicatee reference would not have been apparent as the compositor set up E1. Since two presses were in operation, it is plausible to infer that two compositors were involved, one unaware of the other's title-page setting strategy. On the other hand, it makes less sense to claim that between E1 and L1, one compositor came up with a new solution. But, in the final analysis, the title-page texts may simply reflect what was in printer's copy. 31 It is worth noting that editorial practice has often relied upon stop-press “corrections” as reliable evidence of sequence, the “superior reading” being taken as the later, corrected state. For those who innocently ascribe to this view, a necessary antidote is provided in Peter Blayney's discussion of “revisng, and pressc-orrecting” [sic] in Chapters 6 and 7, The Texts of King Lear and Their Origins. Along these lines, see my discussion about the printing of Thomas Middleton's The Triumphs of Honor and Virtue (1622), which contains four spelling changes in B-inner that appear to be “superior readings” due to modernization (e.g., “approch” to “approach”) but are actually the compositor's solution to a justification problem which caused a noticeable upward bowing of lines and a downward shift of types at the right end of the lines forcing them to slide below the baseline (see “A `Fill-In' Job: The Textual Crux and Interrupted Printing in Thomas Middleton's The Triumphs of Honor and Virtue [1622],” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 93 [1999], 53-73). 32 It should be noted that the sequence of watermarks is numbered according to the inference that Muiopotmos was printed first. I must strongly emphasize that the distribution cannot be interpreted as evidence of the sequence in which the sheets were printed. It would be tempting to infer, for example, that the occurrence of #2 and #4 in the Huntington copy only in Muiopotmos indicates that these two papers were used up before sections 1, 2, 3, and Daphnaida were printed. The distribution of a single book can in no circumstance support such an inference. When the Folger copies 1 and 2 are added to the distribution, #4 appears in sigs. Q and R as well. However, it is absolutely certain that Daphnaida is from the same job-lot. 33 For the various methods by which manuscripts were disseminated, see Harold Love's “Scribal Publication in Seventeenth Century England,” Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 9 (Part 2, 1987), 130-154. Ponsonby's reference to “sundry handes” suggests Love's category in which a network of friends takes copies of earlier copies ultimately deriving from the author's copy. A detailed illustration of the practice, including unauthorized print publication, is provided in Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres where the fictional publisher “H. W.” admits to having taken such a copy from the manuscript provided by his friend “G. T.” and used it as printer's copy (see the presatory letter “H. W. to the Reader,” 2A1 r -v). 34 This point would be of special significance to Ponsonby. His profitable role as the Sidney's official publisher stemmed directly from an incident in November 1586. Having discovered that the printed publication of Sidney's Old Arcadia without authorization from the family was imminent, Ponsonby notified Fulke Greville, who then requested that Sir Francis Walsingham (Sidney's father-in-law and executor) move quickly to block publication. During the 1590s, Ponsonby had to contend with repeated attempts by other publishers to produce unauthorized editions of Sidney's work from intercepted manuscripts. For discussion, see Michael Brennan, “William Ponsonby: Elizabethan Stationer,” Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography, 6-7 (1982-83), 91-110.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE PRINTER AND DATE OF Q4 A LOOKING GLASS FOR LONDON AND ENGLAND by Laurie E. Maguire</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Q4 of the morality drama A Looking Glass for London and England, by Robert Greene and Thomas Lodge, survives in only one copy, now in the Joseph Regenstein Library of the University of Chicago. 1 The quarto lacks a title-page; thus the printer is not immediately identifiable. The manuscript notes in the quarto's margins have, in fact, aroused more interest than the printing operation for they show that the volume functioned as a prompt-book at some time in the early seventeenth century. 2 However, the printed text is itself of interest qua printed text, and provides ample internal evidence to identify the printer as William Jaggard and the date of publication as 1605.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Q4 A Looking Glass is printed from a worn-out black letter fount. It begins with a rectangular lace ornament composed, as was customary, of individual small lace ornaments (in this instance, thirty-six in four rows of nine). Whereas printers usually placed the individual lace ornaments in a symmetrical arrangement (/ / or \\ or /\ /\ or \/ \/ for example), in Q4 A Looking Glass the printer has placed the types randomly, creating a disordered grouping. There are several pieces of broken type: the E of “England” in the half-title has lost its upper horizontal; the lowest horizontal of a smaller roman capital E, used in “Exeunt” (C4 r ), has a nick or dent; and there is a broken A in one of the skeletons of the running-title. Shortage of roman capitals afflicts the quarto throughout (most notably R, L, A, and C), with lower case and alternative founts being used freely to remedy the deficiency. An opening quotation mark or turned comma is used throughout instead of an apostrophe; the running-titles (in roman) use an anomalous swash italic k in “looking.” Q4 A Looking Glass is a careless and unattractive piece of printing: Baskervill described it as “crudely” printed, with “dropped, broken or inverted types” (p. 33). In all of these anomalous features it resembles a series of texts printed by William Jaggard for Thomas Pavier in 1604-05.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1605 appeared the first quartos of The Fair Maid of Bristow (anonymous; STC 3794), Captain Thomas Stukeley (anonymous; STC 23405) and I Hieronimo (Thomas Kyd?; STC 15085). 3 No printer is named on the title-pages, although all three quartos bear Thomas Pavier's device (McKerrow 345), and the similarities in typographical arrangement led W. W. Greg to conclude that “all three no doubt came from the same press.” 4 Q2 Jack Straw (1604) shares the damaged typography which typifies these three other plays and is clearly a product of the same press. In 1974 Richard Proudfoot identified the printer of all four plays as William Jaggard, 5 a discovery made independently for the revised STC prior to 1976.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A brief survey of the typographical characteristics of these four identified plays will be helpful. The printing operation was careless, and perhaps also hasty, as is evidenced by the errors throughout (particularly in the inaccurate reprint of Jack Straw ). 6 All plays are printed in an old, worn, blackletter fount, with several pieces broken (a Th ligature, an st ligature, numerous G's whose inner verticals and whose outer curve show various stages of deterioration). 7 The incidental roman is not without its share of damage (an E which has lost its lowest horizontal, a C whose mid-point curve is broken). 8 The printer was short of roman majuscules (most notable examples are L, A, H, and R) and used either minuscules or an anomalous fount. An opening quotation mark or turned comma is used consistently as an apostrophe throughout all four quartos. All texts mix roman and arabic signatures (Dii./D3, for example) and all have a disproportionately large running-title (the type size is the same as that used on the title-pages). A disordered lace ornament appears on Fair Maid F2v, Case is Altered A3r, A3v, A4r, and B1r, Jewel for the Ear A3r and C4v, I Hieronimo F3v. The type evidence of two other nondramatic texts indicates that they were also printed by Jaggard for Pavier in 1605: a second edition of a twelve-page pamphlet by F.[rancis] T.[hynne], The Case Is Altered, dated 1605 (`Printed for Thomas Pauyer'; STC 23615, first published 1604) and a reprint of Robert Wilkinson's sermon A Jewel for the Ear (`Printed at London for Thomas Pauyer,... 1905' [i.e. 1605]; STC 25653, first published in 1593, second edition c.1602). 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evidence of shared watermarks shows that Jack Straw and The Case is Altered are printed on a single mixed batch of paper; Captain Thomas Stukeley, I Hieronimo, The Fair Maid of Bristow, and A Jewel for the Ear were printed on another single mixed batch. Because printers ordered paper specifically for the project in hand, 10 the two different batches suggest that Jack Straw and The Case is Altered were printed in an operation separate from that of the other four works. This grouping is based on the assumption that one batch would be depleted before the other was drawn on. That condition is not inevitable but its probability is high; were the printer to add the second batch of paper to his first batch, moreover, we should expect crosscontamination of paper in the extant copies, and this is not the case. 11</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If we can trust the evidence of the imprint of Q2 Jack Straw, the printing operation seems to have begun with the reprints of Jack Straw (1604; presumably towards the end of that year) and (judging from the similar paper) The Case is Altered (1605); the four items on the other paper would then have been produced, probably together, in a second operation. Collation of the title-pages of The Fair Maid and Hieronimo shows that the type for the device and imprint was left standing, and that these two plays therefore were printed in chronological proximity. A misprint in Hieronimo (a turned u for the first n in London) reads correctly in The Fair Maid; the evidence of type elsewhere in these plays confirms what might be anticipated—that the change is in the direction of correctness, and that Hieronimo was printed first. In the black letter type in the text, the many f's and long s's that print faintly in Hieronimo are so worn as to be almost invisible by The Fair Maid (see, for example, Fair Maid A4 v , E4 r , F1 v ). A Jewel for the Ear must have followed the printing of the other three works sharing its paper, for the device, which is already damaged in Stukeley, Hieronimo, and The Fair Maid, has sustained further injury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A tentative order of printing thus emerges: 1) Jack Straw, 2) The Case is Altered, ?3) Captain Thomas Stukeley, 4) I Hieronimo, 5) The Fair Maid of Bristow, 6) A Jewel for the Ear. Stukeley is the only text with a questionable position in the series: it must come before Jewel and almost certainly after Case; it probably (on the basis of Fair Maid 's worn fount) comes before Fair Maid; and given the shared setting of the title-pages of Hieronimo and Fair Maid it reasonably comes before Hieronimo as well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The revised STC attributes the undated Q4 of Robert Greene and Thomas Lodge's A Looking Glass for London and England to Ralph Blower (the reasons for this attribution will be examined shortly). This quarto instead belongs, I believe, to the group of Jaggard-Pavier 1604-05 texts. Pavier had acquired the copyright of A Looking Glass for London and England on 14 August 1600 (along with that of The Spanish Tragedy, Jack Straw, and nine other texts 12 ) and he published a third quarto of the play in 1602. It was printed for him by Thomas Creede (the printer of quartos 1 and 2, for William Barley); the undated Q4 is, like its predecessors, in black letter (Q5, 1617, is in roman). It is evident from my introductory summary of the printing features of Q4 A Looking Glass that it has some suggestive similarities to the six texts described above: a disordered lace ornament; the use of an opening quotation mark or turned comma as an apostrophe; a serious shortage of upper case roman, lower case and anomalous founts being used freely to remedy the deficiency; mixed roman and arabic signatures. A distinctive feature in Jack Straw, Captain Thomas Stukeley, and The Case is Altered — the use of a Wh ligature in place of a simple capital W 13 —occurs on signature C1 r of Q4 A Looking Glass in the catchword “Whithin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One further parallel strengthens the case for attributing Q4 A Looking Glass to Jaggard and the Stukeley group: watermarks. The batch of paper on which the Stukeley-Hieronimo-Fair Maid-Jewel group is printed contains a bunch of grapes, doubled circles, and several varieties of pot. Of particular interest is a pot with the initials “MV”: see E1 of Fair Maid (British Library copy) and B3 of Stukeley (British Library copy 2). Q4 A Looking Glass also has mixed watermarks (a bunch of grapes, two kinds of pots); one pot (on D1) has the initials “MV”.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1968 Berta Sturman published an article in Studies in Bibliography in which she offered a date of 1605 for Q4 A Looking Glass and identified the printer as Ralph Blower. 14 It will be pertinent to examine her reasons. First, Sturman remarks that the type is identical to that of I Hieronimo, Jack Straw, The Fair Maid of Bristow, and Captain Thomas Stukeley, and must have come from the same press. (We have seen above that two later, independent authorities—the revised STC, and Richard Proudfoot for the Malone Society—identified Jaggard as the printer of those four plays.) Sturman further identifies the printer of Q4 A Looking Glass as the printer of an anonymous 1603 pamphlet, Present Remedies against the Plague (STC 5871.7, formerly STC 20868), which has a haphazardly arranged lace ornament, the same black letter fount, and Pavier's device. In these ways it resembles the Stukeley group; and again, the reivsed STC assigns it to Jaggard's printing house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sturman's primary evidence comes from STC 10158, A Conterbury Visitation Article for 1605, printed by Ralph Blower for Thomas Pavier. The disordered lace ornament familiar from the Stukeley group, Sturman claims, appears on A2 v and C3 v . However, a noticeable attempt has been made at symmetrical arrangement and no such effort is apparent in the Jaggard texts. Sixteen (eight groups of two) of the twenty squares on A2 v of A Canterbury Visitation Article are perfectly symmetrical (\/), with the remaining four providing the four isolated squares which begin and conclude each of the two lines. Of the thirty-six squares on C3 v , twenty-eight form a regular patern (/\), and, given that each line has nine square ornaments, a single symmetrical line of alternating pattern is not possible. Indeed, in the first two lines the compositor seems to be planning a sequence that is symmetrical from both left and right, with a single type left in the middle (spaces are added here to emphasize pattern divisions): /\/\ / /\/\ (line 1); \/\/ \ \/\/ (line 2). Unlike the Jaggard texts, all the types are the same way up. There is nothing haphazard about this. In addition, the lace ornament in A Canterbury Visitation is in much rougher condition than that in the Jaggard group and is similar to the one in other Blower texts of this period (Gilbert Dugdale's The Time Triumphant, 1604 [STC 7292] and A. T.'s A Rich Storehouse, or Treasurie for the Diseased, 1607 [STC 23607].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sturman comments (p. 251) that A Canterbury Visitation Article “seems to have been set from the same font of black-letter type” as the Stukeley group. Since there were only two designs of pica black letter available to printers at this date, the chances of Blower using the same design as another printer are even. The differences in the two designs of pica black letter are most noticeable in certain capital letters—a square T or a round T, for example. With the help of Peter Blayney I examined printed books in pica black letter from 19 of the 22 printers active in 1605 (where no book was printed by a particular printer that year the dates either side were used); 16 of the printers used the same fount as Blower and Jaggard. Thus, the same design does not prove that the texts are from the same printing house. And the printing house that produced A Canterbury Visitation Article is clearly not the same as the printing house that produced the Stukeley group. The Blower text has no shortage of types, and the roman alphabet which features as contrast in the Blower text is different from the roman in the Jaggard texts (the most obvious differences are in majuscule M and minuscule g). Furthermore, A Canterbury Visitation Article was printed on a single batch of paper, the watermark throughout being a pot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sturman calls attention to a broken G in some of the texts: A3r and C4v of Jack Straw (1604), D4r (line 5) and F2v (line 2) of Captain Thomas Stukeley (1605), F2r of A Looking Glass for London and England, and H2v (line 3) of Dekker's The Bachelor's Banquet, 1603 (STC 6476.2). She describes the break (p. 250) as diagonal, removing the upper outer curve and part of each of the inner vertical lines. Such a break does occur on H2v of The Bachelor's Banquet (A-D of which was printed by Thomas Creede, E-G and H-K by anonymous others). However, her other examples are less convincing. Broken G's do appear on A3r and C4v (lines 24 and 20 respectively) of Jack Straw, but they do not correspond. C4v lacks the lower portion of the right vertical but the rest of the letter is intact. A3r is the same with additional damage to a tiny portion of the top left vertical. (This page also contains another, less damaged G in line 4.) Sturman ignores the many varied broken G's through out this text (a preliminary count reveals 28 appearances of 13 broken G's). Some of these are variant states of one piece of type, but it is clear (see next paragraph) that there was more than one damaged G type.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D4r and F2v of Captain Thomas Stukeley contain broken G's but they are less damaged than those in The Bachelor's Banquet. (Signature F2v is in fact less broken than D4 r . The right vertical is broken but the left vertical and curve, although nicked, are still printing; in D4r the curve is injured, but still less so than in The Bachelor's Banquet, H2v.) There are, however, two broken G's (lines 2 and 6) in Captain Thomas Stukeley F2v, and Sturman does not seem to have taken this into account. Furthermore, when she writes that “the broken G” matches that in F2r of Q4 A Looking Glass, she omits to mention that there are a great number of broken G's throughout A Looking Glass, some of which match Captain Thomas Stukeley and The Bachelor's Banquet. The example she cites (F2r) is not one of them. Given that the tympan is more loosely packed for black letter type than for roman (since there is more metal to hit the page, requiring a stronger pull by the pressman, looser packing encourages the paper to be more responsive to the impression), it is virtually impossible to distinguish broken or bent black letter from poorly inked black letter without a microscope. Sturman's argument is very weak. She herself admits that it is vitiated by lack of corroborating type evidence in other Blower texts, and that her date of 1605 is only a conjecture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alarmingly, the revised STC also assigns Q4 A Looking Glass to Blower, with a queried date of 1605. The attribution was, however, made from the evidence presented in Sturman's article, 15 even though her conclusion contradicts information given elsewhere in the same volume of the STC (notably the attribution of 1 Hieronimo, The Fair Maid of Bristow, Captain Thomas Stukeley, and Q2 Jack Straw to Jaggard's printing house). Further examination of Q4 A Looking Glass will provide more detailed typographical information than has been possible for this note. But it is clear that the similarities outlined above between Q4 A Looking Glass and the Stukeley plays give Jaggard a convincing claim to be printer of the Q4 text. 16 The use of title-page and half-title type for the running-titles does not feature in Q4 A Looking Glass, which has running-titles of normal size; this suggests that Jaggard had acquired some new type by the time he came to print Q4 A Looking Glass and so places this play at the end of the proposed sequence of 1604-05 texts. The publisher was almost certainly Pavier, who owned the copyright and who published other texts printed by Jaggard in 1604-05.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A JOINT-PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR BOOKS IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY MASSACHUSETTS by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On August 27, 1760, seven men in the town of Bellingham, Massachusetts, signed an agreement to acquire jointly a seven-volume edition of Tobias Smollett's A Complete History of England. 1 This set is now in the Archives and Special Collections Department of Amherst College Library, the gift of a descendent of one of the original purchasers. 2 The books are interesting for revealing reading tastes in an eighteenth-century community, but they are of special significance because of an early transcription of the agreement itself that is pasted into the first volume. This document, transcribed below, affords a rare glimpse into the organization of an early American book club, while various annotations in the set also suggest that these books with others formed a short-lived communal library in Bellingham around 1800.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seven purchasers apparently were all farmers in a town thirty-five miles southwest of Boston. Bellingham at the time had about 500 residents, many of them connected by family and marriage, church membership, or sheer physical proximity. Its economy depended to at least some degree on travellers between Boston and Hartford, cities from which the residents would obtain raw materials or items not produced locally. A modern historian of the town, Bruce Lord, suggests that the organizer of the group might have been the Reverend Elnathan Wight, Baptist pastor of the only church in the community. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wight appears to have been the common element among the parties, and his vocation and his education may have tended to make him a leader in such matters. (None of the participants had any college education, but Wight had studied theology and classical languages under an ordained minister in 1747-49.) Wight's family, moreover, eventually ended up with the books. Wight had been among the fifteen signers of the first covenant of the church, on 23 November 1737; he donated the land for its building in 1744; he became (under provisional Congregational ordination) its pastor in 1750; and he was ordained (by Baptist ministers) in 1755, 4 serving the congregation until his death at age 46 in 1761. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many of the signers were linked to Wight through the church or through family connections. Among them was one of his nephews, Samuel Wight, a local farmer and civic office-holder whose father had signed the 1737 church covenant and was a deacon in the church. The father of participant Eliphelet Holbrook, Jr., had also signed that covenant; the younger Holbrook married the Rev. Wight's niece (Samuel Wight's sister) in 1753. Ebenezer Partridge (“Patridge” in the document) was from Franklin, a few miles east of Bellingham, but he died in Bellingham; he was probably the brother of still another signer of the 1737 covenant (Joseph Partridge, born in 1705). Ebenezer Holbrook, who was born in nearby Mendon but died in Bellingham, contributed to the church's ministerial fund in 1743 and signed its 1750 covenant; he married a Keziah Wight early in 1748 and may have been related to the Rev. Wight by marriage. Silas Wheelock was baptized by Wight in 1756. Mathew Smith is the most shadowy of the partners; he died in Bellingham in 1776.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From what can be determined about the participants, they appear to have been from 30 to 50 years old, and their names seem to be listed in order of decreasing age—a practice in accord with the contract's first stipulation, which assigned borrowing rights from “the oldest, unto the youngest.” The first signer, Partridge, was described upon his death in 1794 as “an old man.” He seems to have been born around 1710 and would have been about 50 at the time of the agreement. The Rev. Wight, who follows, was then 45. Ebenezer Holbrook, the third signer and longest survivor of the group, died in 1805 at 88; he was 43 when the compact was made. The sixth signer on the list, Eliphelet Holbrook, Jr., died in 1776 at age 51 or 52; in 1760 he was about 35, five years older than the final signatory, Samuel Wight, who would have been about 30 (he died in 1790 at age 60). The ages of the fourth and fifth signers have to be inferred more indirectly. Smith had a daughter born in Bellingham in 1753; he could well have been younger than Ebenezer Holbrook (43) and older than Eliphelet Holbrook, Jr. (35). The most problematic is Wheelock. He died in 1793, and he, his wife, and his daughter had been baptized by Elnathan Wight in 1756. His daughter would have had to be old enough to receive adult baptism in Wight's Baptist congregation and could well have been born in the 1740s—and her father born shortly before 1725, making him slightly older than Eliphelet Holbrook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The document itself is written on a half-sheet of paper, probably pot, and measures 192 by 316 mm. Because the paper is laid (with an Arms of England watermark and chainlines about 24 mm. apart), it almost certainly derives from the eighteenth century. The manuscript is clearly a transcription, for all the signatures are in the same hand. It is glued to the front paste-down and attached to the inside of the first free endpaper of volume 1 of the Complete History (and is now split at the fold, with the two parts measuring respectively 192 × 123 mm. and 192 × 193 mm.). The text of the agreement occupies one entire side of the paper, and the signees' names are on the back of the lower portion. Pencilled notes next to the names of both Wights suggest what is supported by Wight family signatures on the endpapers—that this was probably Samuel or Elnathan's copy of the agreement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The contract consists of an introduction identifying the books and specifying the purchase price, six articles delineating their use, and a conclusion and seven signatures binding the signers and their heirs to the terms. The group had acquired the seven-volume edition, published in London late in December 1758, rather than the eleven-volume one, not available in London until June or July of 1760. Presumably that choice reflects the relative cost and availability of the editions. Although the seven-volume edition may have been convenient for distribution among the purchasers, it seems to me more likely that the size of the membership was determined by the number of books in the set. The price the members paid, £3 14s 8d in Massachusetts currency, was in any event an attractive one. The seven-volume set had been originally offered in London for £2 15s in boards (as advertised in the London Evening Post on 30 December 1758 and throughout the next year); with the appropriate multiplier for that time of 1.3, the equivalent price in Bellingham would have been £3 11s 6d. 6 As the objects themselves reveal, however, the set in question was not sewn in boards but bound in calf. A contemporary London price announces the charge for similar work (“octavos, demy calf”) as a shilling per volume; 7 the Bellingham residents therefore paid four or five Massachusetts shillings less than they might have been expected to—a figure all the more surprising if the price included transportation charges.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The six provisos focus on physical custody—who got which volume at the start, how volumes might be exchanged, who besides members might borrow the books, how ownership would be affected if a member died or moved from the area, and where the agreement itself would be stored. Though all seven people had an equal financial stake in the undertaking, priority in first choosing a volume to read devolved according to age. Though indviduals might have made personal arrangements to see volumes in a certain order, the assumption behind the rules seems to be that the volumes usually would not be read consecutively. Unlike with a subscription library, the owners of the books shared no central depository, and borrowing was to occur privately outside of any regular meeting or gathering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The joint purchase and the agreed rules for borrowing books and keeping track of them thus produced a book club. At some point the volumes were reunited physically, for all were annotated in the same hand and pen on the recto of the front free endpaper with the phrases “The Bellingham Library” and “Book N°,” followed by a number from 32 to 38. That this occurred by 1816 is indicated by an ownership inscription in volume 1 that crosses out the library notation, identifies the book as the property of A. and S. Wight, and gives the date May 7, 1816. The library numbers in the books point to the existence of a larger collection, almost a century before what is otherwise considered to be the first library in the town, the present public one that was established in 1894. 8 A subscription library at the end of the eighteenth century or beginning of the next certainly would have been in the spirit of the times, for catalogs and advertisements testify to a good number of such organizations during that era in Massachusetts. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The “A. &amp; S. Wight” whose names appeared not only in the first volume but, in expanded form, in all the others as well were Abiram and Seneca Wight, descendents of two of the original subscribers. Their ownership suggests that the spirit and to some extent the letter of the 1760 agreement remained in effect. The books had remained in Bellingham, and they had done so in the context of respect for age, specifically of primogeniture. Abiram, born in 1763, was the eldest surviving son of co-purchaser Samuel Wight; his second-cousin Seneca was the eldest son of a son of another subscriber, the Rev. Elnathan Wight. The intermediate generation, Seneca's father Eliab, had been Elnathan's second son, but Eliab seems to have inherited rights to the books because, as Lord notes, his elder brother moved from the area. The cousins gave the books new numbers, this time 47 through 53; the joint ownership of at least fifty-three volumes suggests the vestige of a book club ideal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The division of rights to the books is made clear by a note that Seneca added to the first volume: on the verso of the front free endpaper he wrote, “The history of 7 Volums belongs one half to Seneca Wight and the other half to Marcy &amp; Luceny Wight.” Marcy and Luceny (spelled “Lusina” in other documents) were Abiram's younger sisters (born in 1766 and 1769). Whether by inheritance, purchase, or other transfer of claim, Seneca eventually acquired sole ownership of the books. At that point he crossed out the joint ownership inscriptions in all seven volumes and signed his own name above (vol. 1) or below (vols. 2-7). Beside his name he repeated the book numbers the volumes had been assigned when they were the joint property of himself and Abiram.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1859 Seneca gave the Smollett set to Josiah T. Reade, the son of his next eldest sister, Abigail, and her husband Samuel T. Reade. Beneath the ownership inscription for himself and the two Wight women he recorded this gift: “This history of 7 volums given to Josiah J. Read my nephew July 28th 1859 Seneca Wight.” His echoing of the 1816 ownership inscription suggests a respectful consciousness of the status of the books as Wight family heirlooms and also as vehicles for a historic tradition of shared book ownership.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some of Reade's substantial library was inherited by his grandson Ralph W. B. Reade, who gave the books to the library of Amherst College, Josiah T. Reade's alma mater, about 1944. That donation brings the history of the Smollett edition up to date, though it keeps alive the question of whether other books belonging to “The Bellingham Library,” or indeed to the eighteenth-century subscription group, still exist. No other books from Reade at Amherst qualify. John Lancaster writes, however, that when Josiah T. Reade died in 1929, at age 100, “Most of his books went to the Helen M. Plum Memorial Library in Lombard, Illinois, where he and Colonel Plum had been stalwart book collectors—Plum apparently had enough money to endow the institution, but Reade's 3,000+ volumes made up a large part of the collection.” 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An exhaustive search in the Plum Memorial Library near Chicago might turn up other books that a century or two ago stood on the shelf next to the Bellingham Smollett—and produce more tales of the roles that books have played in the lives of their owners and readers.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1 This octavo edition (ESTC N1503) was published in London by James Rivington, James Fletcher, and Richard Baldwin, Jr., in December 1758. It was sold with a promissory note for 167 engraved plates and an index until those were made available on 27 November 1760 ( London Evening Post, 20-22 November 1760). Smollett's Complete History had first appeared in four quarto volumes in 1757-58 and was also serialized, with engraved plates, in 110 parts from 1758 to 1760 for collection as an eleven-volume octavo set.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">3 Mr. Lord has been extraordinarily generous to the author, and his help has been indispensable for determining the age of several signers of the manuscript. He has provided me with several dozen manuscript pages of his histories of the town, the First Baptist Church, and some prominent families.

I also extend grateful acknowledgement to Laura Einstadter, Librarian of the Bellingham Public Library, who fielded my queries and introduced me to Mr. Lord.

That collection frequently cites a diary (now lost) kept from 1755 to 1849 by Samuel Wight (one of the signers) and his daughters that records the deaths of all the other signers—and in so doing suggests their familiarity with each other, or at least with the Wight family.</field>

Table 3.1 offers 127.08 for the May 1760 exchange and 135 for the December 1760 exchange; the exchange during the preceding and following six years was usually set at 133.3.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">“A SORT OF BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE BRITISH LAND OF LETTERS”: THE MONTHLY MAGAZINE AND ITS REVIEWERS, 1796-1811 by David Chandler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Signing off the last number of The Watchman, the miscellany he had published at eight-day intervals in spring 1796, Coleridge stated: Those... who expected from it much and varied original composition, have naturally relinquished it in favour of the New MONTHLY MAGAZINE; a Work, which has almost monopolized the talents of the Country, and with which I should have continued a course of literary rivalship with as much success, as might be supposed to attend a young Recruit who should oppose himself to a Phalanx of disciplined Warriors. Long may it continue to deserve the support of the Patriot and the Philanthropist, and while it teaches RATIONAL LIBERTY, prepare it's readers for the enjoyment of it, strengthening the intellect by SCIENCE, and softening our affections by the GRACES ! 1 There can be few better or more memorable statements of the amazing impact the Monthly Magazine (hereafter MM ) had on the literary world of Great Britain in 1796. Apparently planned by the eminent Unitarian and scientist Joseph Priestley before his emigration to America in April 1794, 2 the MM was published by the radical bookseller Richard Phillips. Designed as a forum for literary and intellectual Dissenters, the first number appeared in February 1796 with a preface announcing “two leading ideas”: the first to provide “various objects of information and discussion,” the second to lend “aid to the propagation of those liberal principles respecting some of the most important concerns of mankind, which ha[d] been either deserted or virulently opposed by other Periodical Miscellanies.” 3 The formula quickly proved a success, and within a year of its inauguration the MM was outselling almost every other periodical published in Britain. 4 Over the following fifteen years its success was more or less continuous; as late as 1811 Phillips could report that sales were higher than ever. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite its centrality in the Romantic period, and despite the fact that it included the work of writers like Coleridge (“The Ancient Mariner” was originally intended for its pages), Southey, Lamb, Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Amelia Opie, the MM as a whole has received remarkably little scholarly attention. In part, one suspects, this has been for bibliographical reasons. Much of the writing in the MM was anonymous, and there is no one convenient source that assembles the various attributions and identifications that have been made. An annotated anthology of the best material in the MM, both poetry and prose, is very much a desideratum for scholars of the period. The present article is concerned with the so far unexplored subject of reviewing in the MM. Brief reviews of (nearly) all current publications were given every six months in the form of a “Retrospect”. These must have been among the most widely read and circulated critical judgments of the perod, and are of great value to the literary (or other) scholar today; indeed the MM 's pithy reviews are often quoted in studies of the critical reception of particular works. Inevitably lost sight of in such selective citation is the individual review's relationship to the “Retrospect” as a whole. For example, simply the relative lengths of reviews often point to value judgments. Moreover the “Retrospects” reinforced the encyclopædic scope and mixing of literary and non-literary writing that characterised the MM as a whole, so are now of probably unrivalled value as a source for ascertaining the status literary works held vis-à-vis other types of publication for a very large section of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century reading public. In fact it is no exaggeration to say that these “Retrospects” convey a more profound sense of the intellectual and cultural diversity of their period than any other published material of similar, or even much greater length. They merit critical attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not the least interesting aspect of the MM 's “Retrospects” is that, from the start, they were entrusted to a single reviewer, and thus present the quite astonishing spectacle of the entire field of British publication being sifted through a single critical consciousness. Although there was a change of reviewer in 1797, the policy of entrusting an individual with the feature was continued for at least a decade, as will be shown here. These reviewers can be identified, and enough is known about them to assess how representative of larger bodies of opinion their personal views are likely to be (though this inquiry is, for the most part, beyond the confines of the present article). The authorship of the “Retrospects” has not previously been examined, and the reviews have often been quoted under the apparent impression that they were editorial. In an influential study of reviewing in the Romantic period published in 1969 John O. Hayden merely noted that “`a Mr. Norgate of Norwich' was usually the critic in the supplements,” 6 while in a brief study of the MM published in 1983 Kenneth Curry stated (without reference to Hayden) that Thomas Starling Norgate “contributed the `Half-Yearly Retrospect of Literature' from 1797 to 1807,” 7 citing no authority for the statement, which, in any case, other scholars have continued to ignore. It seems certain, though, that Curry took the information from Frederick Norgate's account of Thomas Starling Norgate (1772-1859) in the Dictionary of National Biography. The present article improves and expands on Frederick Norgate's (misleading) hint, but it begins with a few essential points about the editorial organisation of the MM and the particular species of review that was published in its pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phillips employed as his “literary editor” John Aikin, a prominent Unitarian man of letters, and Aikin was consulted at an early stage in the plan of the new work. 8 Lucy Aikin's Memoir of her father describes his role thus: All the original correspondence came under his [Aikin's] inspection; articles were inserted or rejected according to his judgement.... To provide materials for the Magazine was not strictly a part of his compact;—but the honorable anxiety which he always felt to perform every task committed to him in the best manner possible... prompted him... to go far beyond the letter of his engagement; and besides enriching it to a great extent with his own pieces, he was diligent in his applications to the literary characters with whom he was connected by the ties of friendship; and by means principally of their contributions the new Magazine assumed a rank in letters to which only one of its predecessors [presumably the Gentleman's Magazine ] had ever ventured to aspire. (I, 189) From this account, as well as from the event, which will be described below, it appears that the decision of what to do about reviewing was largely Aikin's. Initially this was an uncertain point, but by the time the first number went to press a series of “HALF-YEARLY RETROSPECTS” had been planned, a compromise that it was believed would “give general satisfaction” (I, iv). When the first of these “Retrospects” subsequently appeared, in July 1796, an introductory paragraph further clarified what was being attempted: ALTHOUGH we have not attempted in our Miscellany to unite the two characters of a Magazine and a Review—an attempt which has never yet been made with success, and which, in the present state of official criticism, is altogether unnecessary; it may perhaps, be useful, or, at least, amusing, if, according to our proposal, at the commencement of our labours, we, at regular intervals, take a general retrospect of the state of literature. Our survey must necessarily be cursory—a sort of bird's eye view of the British land of letters; but, we trust, it will not be altogether unacceptable to our readers. (II, 481) A “bird's eye view” was then presented under a series of subheadings: “Theology”, “Politics”, “Political Œconomy”, “Commerce”, “Law”, “Medicine, Chemistry, &amp;c.”, “Agriculture”, “Natural History”, “Chronology”, “History”, “Biography”, “Voyages and Travels”, “Topography”, “Criticism”, “Original Poetry”, “Dramatic Pieces, &amp;c.”, “Novels, Romances, &amp;c.”, “Education”, “Shakspearean [ sic ] Mss.” In miniature the MM was thus aiming at the sort of comprehensiveness that had been a hallmark of the Monthly Review and Critical Review, the major reviewing periodicals of the eighteenth century. The Edinburgh Review, founded in 1802, was the first important reviewing periodical of the new century and successfully established the modern principle of selectivity. The MM, in fact, stands out as the last important British reviewing work to aim at the ideal of universality, so characteristic of Enlightenment thinking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It can be added that Aikin probably adapted the idea of a comprehensive “Retrospect” from the New Annual Register that Andrew Kippis, another prominent Unitarian man of letters, had founded with great success in 1781 (in political opposition to the Annual Register ). The first account of “Domestic Literature” in that work had explained, just fifteen years before the foundation of the MM, the aims and limitations of what was clearly understood as a new departure in English periodical criticism: WERE we to give an account, with extracts, of every publication of the year, we should be obliged to run to a length inconsistent with our plan, and which, indeed, would be absolutely impracticable. At the same time, we should interfere with those very useful and established periodical works, the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and, by coming after them, should only present passages to our readers with which many of them are already acquainted. On the other hand, to take notice of no more than two or three considerable performances, to the neglect of the rest, would justly be deemed a defect, and might even have the appearance of some partiality. We shall, therefore, strike into a middle course, by giving a concise and general history of the literature of the year; in which, whilst trifling and unworthy productions are neglected, none are omitted, (unless by inadvertence) that are truly important. In short, we shall endeavour to draw up such a summary of the state of learning as shall tend to set it in its true light.... (I, 199 [3rd Section])</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The New Annual Register 's “concise and general, history” had originally been just that, the first being less than eighteen pages in length. By the 1790s, however, “concise” was no longer true; the “summaries” had swelled to upwards of eighty dense pages that very few readers can have had the patience to read consecutively. For this reason the MM was able to offer something new. The twice-yearly formula meant that the critical commentary was much more up-to-date (often, indeed, quite as current as the Monthly Review and Critical Review ), and eight brisk pages replaced the New Annual Register 's ponderous eighty, thus giving a true “bird's eye view.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A manuscript volume of autobiographical memoranda by Thomas Starling Norgate is preserved in the Norfolk Record Office, and proves to be the most important source for identifying the reviewers in the MM. Norgate there describes his friendship with William Enfield (1741-97), the Unitarian minister in Norwich, and notes how “Through Dr Enfield, [he] was introduced to Phillips, &amp; wrote a few Papers in the Monthly Magazine.” 9 He proceeds to record: Dr Enfield... died Nov 3rd 1797. My intercourse... with Phillips... became more frequent from this time. The Doctor had written the “Half-Yearly Retrospect of Domestic Literature” in the Monthly Magazine. On his decease I undertook &amp; executed it for about eight years, at the end of which time my connection with Phillips entirely ceased. For the miscellaneous Communications I received five guineas a sheet, &amp; for the Retrospect, which was very laborious &amp; very useless, I received Six. From the commencement of my connection with the Monthly Magazine to the end of it I received £216.18.0. (Norgate, 238-239) Enfield's indicated role here comes as no surprise, for among the “literary characters” with whom Aikin “was connected by the ties of friendship” none was closer to him than Enfield, his “dear and congenial friend” as Lucy Aikin describes him, from whom he would “`take sweet counsel' in all that interested him, whether as a man or an author” (Aikin, I, 21-22). Enfield was the central figure in the important group of Dissenting Norwich literati that included Norgate. As well as writing the first “Retrospects” he supplied Aikin with the “Enquirer” series, the most impressive articles in the early numbers of the MM. 10 Given Enfield's particularly close friendship with Aikin, and the fact that he undertook the daunting task of writing the “Retrospects”, it is quite possible that he played a part in determining the reviewing formula to be employed by the MM. But whether asked, or whether volunteering, Enfield was a natural choice for the “Retrospects” as he had been an immensely prolific reviewer for the Monthly Review, the most successful of the reviewing periodicals, since 1774. More recently he had become a reviewer for Joseph Johnson's Analytical Review, founded in 1788, as well. 11 He reviewed an astonishingly wide range of publications—historical, theological, educational, and political works as well as novels, plays and poems were among his regulars. He had an educated Dissenter's fascination with almost all branches of knowledge, and he was undoubtedly better able to tackle the daunting task of writing an overall “Retrospect” than almost anyone in the country. Unfortunately, Enfield's early death meant that he only wrote three “Retrospects,” those appearing in the July 1796, January 1797, and July 1797 issues of the MM. He was a great loss to Dissenting culture in this, as in many other respects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Norgate's own testimony, as quoted above, Enfield introduced him to Phillips. In fact it should be clear that Norgate was referring to “Phillips” merely in a general sense as the publisher, for his immediate and practical introduction would have been to Aikin. Norgate's attachment to the MM began very early in its publishing history, as his first “Paper,” on poor relief, was published in March 1796 (I, 116-117). When Norgate assumed responsibility for the “Retrospects” on Enfield's decease he certainly lacked most of the latter's experience. His own reviewing career had begun (surprisingly, given his radical sympathies) in the ministerial British Critic, the first number of which appeared in May 1793; Norgate contributed a “very few” re- views in the 1793-94 period (Norgate, 184-185). Then at the end of 1796, supported and recommended by Enfield, he joined the staff of the Analytical (Norgate, 236-238). In the interim he had written for the radical political journal, The Cabinet (1794-95), and published Essays, Tales and Poems (1795). Still in his mid-twenties, Norgate was not obviously equipped to step into Enfield's shoes, but his enthusiasm and availability, along with the facts of his having been Enfield's friend and a protégé whose literary career Enfield had attempted to promote, probably persuaded Aikin to give him a chance. Given that Enfield's death had been sudden and unexpected, Norgate must have been ready to take over at short notice, possibly inheriting some notes towards a fourth “Retrospect” already made by Enfield. 12 Essentially, though, the fourth “Retrospect”, now placed in a supplementary number which appeared “ About the Middle of January, 1798” (IV, 415), was Norgate's first. (From this time all the “Retrospects” were placed in the supplementary numbers added to each volume.) A change of reviewer is immediately apparent in the introductory remarks, and a tell-tale stylistic change is the fact that while Enfield, a “perfect master of what is called the middle style in writing,” 13 had employed just one exclamation mark in his three “Retrospects,” Norgate found occasion to introduce over thirty in his first. A more significant change was that under Norgate the “Retrospects” immediately increased substantially in length: while Enfield's had been about eight pages long, Norgate's first was already over sixteen pages, and thereafter he established an average length of over thirty pages. Pithy summaries were replaced by more sustained critical encounters, partly because whereas Enfield had written the “Retrospects” as a supplement to his many other reviewing and authorial activities, to Norgate they were the main fruit of a retired life spent, as he wrote in his autobiography, “in reading, writing, &amp; giving my young children the rudiments of Education” (Norgate, 244). Nevertheless, any assessment of Norgate's reviews of literary works—of Lyrical Ballads, say—should take into account the fact that he himself had previously written poetry, short fiction, and essays on a variety of topics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Norgate's own assertion that he wrote the “Retrospects” for “about eight years” obviously contradicts Frederick Norgate's statement that he wrote them until 1807. In fact the precision of Norgate's statement respecting his total earnings from the MM allows us to establish a reasonably safe terminus ad quem for his connection with the periodical. By calculating the amount he earned for his “miscellaneous Communications” and subtracting it from his total earnings, the sum he was paid for the “Retrospects” is deduced. As we know how much he was paid per sheet for these, a cumulative page count can then establish with some accuracy the date at which he must have stopped writing the “Retrospects”. Translated into guineas, Norgate's earn- ings amount to 206 guineas, 12 shillings. Of his “miscellaneous Communications” by far the most considerable is a series of “LETTERS written during an EXCURSION through FRANCE to GENEVA” that appeared between March 1802 and February 1803. 14 These “LETTERS” cover some 50⅔ pages. His other identifiable “miscellaneous Communications” amount to some 18¼ pages. 15 His earnings at 5 guineas a sheet (sixteen pages 16 ) would thus have been approximately 21 guineas, 11 shillings. This means that Norgate's earnings from the “Retrospects” cannot have exceeded 184-185 guineas; as they averaged over thirty pages each, as noted above, he earned on average over 11 guineas for each one. The conclusion must be that he wrote no more than sixteen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As will be shown below, exceptional circumstances prevented Norgate from writing the “Retrospect” for January 1802. However there is no evidence, either internal or external, to suggest that he did not otherwise write them continuously from January 1798 until his “connection with Phillips entirely ceased.” After fifteen “Retrospects”, which, ignoring that for January 1802, takes us to that of July 1805, Norgate had covered some 477¾ pages, which at 6 guineas a sheet would have earned him approximately 179 guineas, 3 shillings. After sixteen “Retrospects” he had covered some 504½ pages, which would have earned approximately 189 guineas, 1 shilling. It can be stated with some certainty, then, that Norgate's final “Retrospect” was either that for July 1805 or that for January 1806. Beyond this the question is whether Phillips was inclined to round up, or round down, in assessing his payments, and from what is known of his character the latter is certainly more likely. 17 In this case Norgate's last “Retrospect” was that for January 1806, which would mean that his responsibility for the “Retrospects” had lasted from November 1797 to January 1806, making his estimate of “about eight years” perfectly correct. Further evidence is that the next “Retrospect” —July 1806—is only just over twenty pages long, much shorter than any of Norgate's known “Retrospects”, except his very first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Other evidence seems to support, and probably explain, this terminal date. When Norgate wrote that his “connection with Phillips entirely ceased,” the suggestion is, surely, that he had failed to leave on amicable terms. It is unlikely to be coincidental, then, that it was just at this juncture that Aikin angrily left Phillips' employment. The immediate cause was that Phillips had chosen Aikin to arbitrate in a case of dispute between himself and an author. Aikin had ruled against Phillips, who reacted so badly that Aikin felt obliged to resign his editorship (Phillips, 71-85). Lucy Aikin's Memoir implies that this was merely the last straw, however, and that Aikin had for a long time found it hard to work with Phillips: Early in the year 1806 my father's connection ceased with the Monthly Magazine, and he immediately engaged in the establishment of a new periodical work, on what he regarded as an improved plan, entitled The Athenœum. The thorough respectability of the publishers concerned, and their entire forbearance of every kind of interference with the management of the editor, rendered his concern in this undertaking a source of great satisfaction to him.... (I, 252) Aikin's defection undoubtedly created quite a stir in the reviewing world. On 27 May 1806 Robert Southey referred to “the rupture between Dr. Aikin and Phillips,—the greatest piece of news since the Prussian war”; Southey felt that the “rupture” would cost Phillips “much of the sale among the dissenters” (Robberds, II, 129-30). In June 1806 William Taylor (1765-1836), a mainstay of the MM, was contemplating leaving Phillips to support Aikin (Robberds, II, 135), though in the end prudent concerns appear to have deterred him, and he wrote for the MM and the Athenœum. 18 As Norgate's connection with the MM had been through Aikin, the close friend of his close friend, Enfield, the latter's departure very likely proved an excuse for Norgate—who had come to consider the “Retrospects” “very laborious &amp; very useless”—to leave. In this case it can again be concluded that the January 1806 “Retrospect” is likely to have been Norgate's last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Between November 1801 and January 1802 Norgate made a trip to Geneva, accompanying his wife's sister, Fanny Randall, who was to settle there (Norgate 244-247; it was his letters from this trip that he later published in the MM ). This prevented him from writing the “Retrospect” as usual, so William Taylor, a friend of Norgate and Aikin, and an erstwhile friend of Enfield's, filled in for him. This, and Taylor's apparently half-serious attitude to the task, are implied in a letter he wrote to Robert Southey on 30 November 1802. In this letter Taylor enquired whether Southey had been asked to contribute to Arthur Aikin's new Annual Review, before continuing: He [Arthur Aikin] has sent me down some books, not very much to my taste,—but I will give it a year's trial,—Pinkerton's `Geography,' and a heap of political trash about the East Indies and the West Indies, and the blacks, and sugar and cotton. That book of Pinkerton's I have just read through; it is the best system of geography extant: as for the rest I shall declaim about the topics indicated by the titles, as in the retrospect of last winter's Monthly Magazine, without heeding the inside. (Robberds, I, 434) More direct evidence of Taylor's authorship is the fact that he identified the January 1802 “Retrospect” as his in his own set of the MM, as recorded by Robberds (Robberds, I, 393). In his introductory remarks to the “Retrospect” itself, Taylor implied, as he did later to Southey, that his attitude to the task was not particularly serious. The form and order of retrospection are of little moment: yet the fewer the subdivisions into which the books are parcelled, the more conveniently can the heaps be arranged on the floor; and the less turning to and fro among Reviews will supply the reputed character of those, which one wants the leisure to slit open, or the will to read. (XII, 573) Taylor, in fact, employed just six “subdivisions,” where in the previous “Retrospect” Norgate had employed nineteen. In other respects his statement here, as in the letter to Southey, should be read as a typical blend of the true with the self-deprecatory; the “Retrospect” contains the sort of vigorous, informed criticism that Taylor had made his trademark, and that was certainly not merely gathered from other reviewing periodicals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is not at all surprising that Taylor, another Norwich man, should have assisted at this juncture. He had been a regular contributor to the MM since its inception (he too was probably obtained by Enfield), and Robberds does not exaggerate when he says “the number and diversity of his [Taylor's] productions can scarcely be paralleled by those of any other writer” (Robberds, I, 391). His reviewing career had begun, again through Enfield, with an attachment to the Monthly Review in 1793. 19 During the 1790s Taylor reviewed a wide diversity of literature and was probably the most important reviewer in the country. 20 He broke with the Monthly Review in 1799, due to personality differences with the editor. In the winter of 1801-1802 he was an experienced reviewer without reviewing employment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having helped Norgate out in January 1802, Taylor contributed at least one longer review to the “Retrospects” submitted by Norgate. This was that of Robert Southey's Madoc that appeared in the July 1805 “Retrospect” (XIX, 656-658; Robberds, II, 91, 102). Taylor was a close friend of Southey's, and a great admirer of Madoc, so the review was really an act of friendship (though certainly not a “puff”). But it does raise the possibility of Taylor's contributing other odd reviews to Norgate's “Retrospects”, even though no evidence for such is known. (The calculations made in this article have assumed that Norgate was paid for the whole of the “Retrospects” that he was responsible for, and that any odd reviews supplied by Taylor were gratuitous.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What happened to the “Retrospects” after January 1806 is less clear. Obviously Taylor would have been Norgate's natural successor. Since January 1802 he had edited the Iris, a Norwich weekly newspaper published in 1803 and 1804, and reviewed extensively for the Critical Review between December 1803 and November 1804. He had, moreover, as suggested in the letter to Southey quoted above, become a reviewer for the Annual Review at its inception in 1802. The latter connection meant that huge numbers of books were passing through Taylor's hands by 1806, putting him in a good position to write the “Retrospects”. Taylor certainly did make some contributions; of volume twenty-six (August 1808-January 1809) his biographer, Robberds, noted: Some parts of the “Retrospect of Domestic Literature” in this volume [i.e. the January 1809 “Retrospect”] were written by William Taylor; but being little more than a list of new publications, they contain nothing of particular interest. (II, 236) Robberds was taking his information from Taylor's own marked set of the MM, and one could wish he had been more specific regarding the “parts” Taylor had written. More puzzling is the fact that Robberds says Taylor contributed a review of George Wilson Meadley's Memoirs of William Paley to the July 1809 “Retrospect” (XXVII, 650; Robberds, II, 302), for this review is so insubstantial—it consists mainly of a quotation from Meadley's preface—that it is almost impossible to imagine it being Taylor's only contribution, and therefore reasonable to suppose that Robberds misunderstood Taylor's identifying marginalia. It is certain, however, that Taylor was supplying at least part of the “Retrospects” in 1809, and it is not unreasonable to think that he may have done so in other years too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time, though, there is rather less interest in who was writing the “Retrospects”, which by January 1808 were clearly declining in quality. The average length had fallen by several pages, yet these were increasingly padded out with long extracts. There was little critical engagement with the works reviewed, and the reviewer(s) clearly relied heavily on prefaces and chapter headings. For these reasons it is difficult to assess what Taylor contributed to the “Retrospects” in 1809, for they are quite different in character from the one he wrote in 1802. It appears probable that Phillips was unable to find anyone willing to assume Norgate's mantle; after January 1806, therefore, the “Retrospects” were divided between several of his writers, none of them committed to maintaining the quality of the feature. One can observe a continuous tinuous deterioration, and the last proper “Retrospect” appeared in January 1811 (XXX, 653-677). A section in the July 1811 supplement was still entitled “Half- Yearly Retrospect of Domestic Literature” (XXXI, 605-673), but it was nothing of the sort. Rather than being the established “bird's eye view of the British land of letters” it was merely extended extracts, briefly introduced, from a handful of publications: over twenty pages were quarried from both William Jacob's Travels in the South of Spain and Anna Seward's Letters. This became the standard formula, and the title of “Retrospect” was finally dropped in July 1812 (XXXIII, 597). Ultimately a failure of human industry, or of suitable reward, can doubtless be blamed as much as the rise of a new type of criticism for the failure of what, at the outset, had promised to be one of the most interesting developments in criticism in the Romantic period.</field>

As Phillips' system of assessing the length of part pages is not known, I have counted them in both quarters and thirds, depending on which was most accurate. (I have assumed that Phillips would not count a fraction smaller than a quarter.) Thus part pages have been counted as ¼, ⅓, ½, ⅔, or ¾ pages, the length being rounded down when there was any ambiguity. For the possibility that Phillips did not count part pages at all, see note 17 below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">16 Charles Dickens wrote to William Pickersgill on 3 April 1844 “A Magazine Sheet is sixteen pages.... When I say that a Magazine Sheet is sixteen pages, I mean sixteen pages of the Magazine, of course”: The Letters of Charles Dickens: Volume Four 1844-1846, ed. Kathleen Tillotson (Oxford, 1977), 94. When the Monthly Review increased its length to 120 pages in 1790, advertisements in various newspapers claimed that it would consist of “seven Sheets and an Half.” Finally, in writing to Philip Bliss on 5 November 1806 about the Athenæum, John Aikin stated, “I suppose we shall be able to allow full a half sheet (8 pages) to the analyses &amp; extracts of curious books” (British Library Add. MS. 34,567, f.7-7 v ). I labour this point to emphasise that there can be no ambiguity over what Norgate means by a “sheet.” At least one scholar has read literally some clearly misunderstood evidence that would make a “sheet” in the MM equal to 42 pages (Dorothy Coldicutt, “Was Coleridge the Author of the `Enquirer' Series in the Monthly Magazine, 1796-9?,” Review of English Studies 15 [1939], 45-60); Robberds, William Taylor's biographer, made the original mistake (Robberds, I, 394-395), clearly reading the figures on a statement of a retrospective “raise” that Phillips had allowed Taylor on some articles as the total sums that Taylor had been paid for those articles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">17 Boyle, 362-363, 366. One possibility is that in assessing the length of each article or “Retrospect” Phillips only counted whole pages. By my calculation this would mean that after sixteen “Retrospects” Norgate would have been paid for 62 pages at 5 guineas a sheet, and 497 pages at 6 guineas a sheet. This would make his total earnings 205 guineas, 16 shillings, just 17 shillings short of the amount he said he had earned.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">LEIGH HUNT'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GUIDE by Nicholas A. Joukovsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While there has never been anything like a complete bibliography of Leigh Hunt's journalism, scholars have often attempted to identify the periodicals to which he contributed with some regularity. However, it does not appear that any of Hunt's bibliographers has noticed a significant group of signed essays in the early numbers of the Guide, a cheap weekly newspaper that ran from 22 April 1837 to 1 April 1838. Only one complete run of this threepenny radical weekly is known to exist, 1 but marked file copies of the first nine numbers are preserved—along with various letters, documents, and accounts relating to the Guide —among the papers of its first editor, Henry Cole, in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum. 2 In his autobiographical Fifty Years of Public Work, Cole devotes only two sentences to his brief editorship and part ownership of the Guide, treating it mainly as a learning experience that he subsequently turned to good account in the campaign for uniform penny postage: In the year 1837, during my contest with the Record Commission, Mr. Charles Buller, M.P., Sir Wm. Molesworth, Bart., M.P., Mr. Leader, M.P. for Westminster, and myself started a cheap threepenny newspaper called the “Guide,” of which I became the editor. Being one of the registered proprietors, and having to go through the dismal and frivolous formalities of obtaining sureties against libel, and for payment of the stamp duties, I became acquainted with all the intricate mysteries of the rights and privileges of newspapers, divided between the Treasury, the Stamp Office, and the Post Office. 3 One would never guess from this account that the first nine numbers of the Guide, edited by Cole, contained writings by John Stuart Mill and Thomas Love Peacock as well as regular contributions by Leigh Hunt. The idea for the Guide seems to have originated with Charles Buller and Henry Cole in the spring of 1837, when Cole was temporarily unemployed as a result of his controversy with the Record Commission. On 9 March, Cole noted in his journal that he “called at Buller's and remained with him for two hours discussing the feasibility of starting a 2nd newspaper.” 4 The refer- ence to “a 2nd newspaper” suggests that the project may have been related in some way to an earlier plan by Sir William Molesworth, John Arthur Roebuck, and John Temple Leader to start a radical Sunday paper in March 1836. 5 Having obtained Buller's approval of the scheme, Cole spent the next six weeks studying the business of newspaper publishing as well as soliciting potential investors and contributors. The total capital raised for the venture was £425: Buller provided £100, while Molesworth and Leader each provided £50, as did both Cole and his brother Frederick Lindsay Cole; Edwin Chadwick, John H. Elliott, Thomas Duffus Hardy, William Edward Hickson, and Henry Hooper, the paper's publisher, each put in £25. 6 The new paper was announced in two prospectuses, the larger of which, printed in the same format as the first two numbers, describes the Guide as “A New Weekly Newspaper, giving the Latest Intelligence of Public Events, and full Information upon all subjects of General Interest.” The smaller prospectus, on a single octavo sheet, lists the following heads under which the contents are to be arranged: Political Guide, Parliamentary Guide, Foreign Guide, Colonial Guide, Gossip, Amusement Guide, Literary Guide, Scientific Guide, Judicial Guide, Commercial and Housekeeper's Guide, Miscellany, Sunday Guide, and Births, Marriages, and Deaths. Although such headings were used fairly regularly in the paper, the actual arrangement proved more flexible than this listing might suggest. The one political issue with which the prospectuses clearly identified the paper was the campaign to eliminate the newspaper tax. The price of each eight-page issue was to be 3 d., of which 1 d. was for the tax, 1 d. for distribution, and 1 d. for editorial and printing costs. 7 Financially this was a bold experiment at a time when most weekly papers cost 6 d. Despite the low price and the generally high quality of the writing, sales of the Guide appear to have disappointed expectations from the start, prompting early changes in both the format and the day of publication. Beginning with No. 3 the format was expanded from approximately 10 inches by 12½ inches with three columns per page to approximately 14 inches by 20 inches with five columns per page, and beginning with No. 5 the day of publication was changed from Saturday to Sunday. Although the circulation more or less doubled within the first eight weeks, it did not increase fast enough to make the paper a paying proposition before the initial capital was exhausted. On 15 June, Cole recorded in his journal that the Guide was sold for £100—a sum that was insufficient to clear the paper's debts. 8 No. 9, published on 18 June, was the last to appear under Cole's editorship. Two days later he noted in his journal that he was “introduced to the new pro- prietor of the Guide who very little predisposed me to cooperate in its management.” On 7 July 1837, Thomas Carlyle explained in a letter to his brother John in Italy: “The Guide was a Paper set up by Buller and some of that set, in which Hunt was engaged as a writer: it was spreading and succeeding but did not yet pay, and their money was done; so they sold it, and a quite new management has it.” 9 Although the Guide continued for another nine months under its new owners, the later issues are devoid of literary interest. Cole's annotated copies of the Guide identify the authorship of many articles in the first nine numbers. As Cole's political mentor and the paper's principal investor, Charles Buller not only wielded considerable editorial influence but also wrote most of the important political articles as well as a weekly “Journal of a Liberal M.P.” Other contributors included Edwin Chadwick, Joseph Clayton, John H. Elliott, Joseph Henry Garnier, Horace Grant, Thomas Duffus Hardy, William Hardy, William Edward Hickson, Richard Hengist Horne, John Mitchell Kemble, and John Robertson. John Stuart Mill produced one short article for the Guide and allowed Cole to print an extract from a longer article prior to its appearance in the London and Westminster Review. 10 Cole himself wrote a good many articles and obtained Thomas Love Peacock's permission to publish the poems that were later privately printed as Paper Money Lyrics, and Other Poems (1837). 11 But whereas Peacock's poems appeared anonymously, Leigh Hunt's name was prominently attached to his eight weekly essays. Leigh Hunt's engagement to write for the Guide was apparently arranged through the paper's printer, Charles Reynell, of 26 Little Pulteney Street, whose family was connected by marriage to Hunt's. On 17 April 1837, five days before the publication of the first number of the Guide, Cole wrote in his journal: “Met Leigh Hunt by appt at Reynells—He agreed to write weekly for £2.” 12 Hunt's essays were obviously an important feature of the new paper, but they were by no means his only contributions. Cole's manuscript note at the head of Hunt's first essay indicates that he was paid a total of £2.5.3 for No. 1—£2.2.0 for the essay plus 3.3 for a “Para[graph].” Although Cole did not mark Hunt's paragraph in No. 1, his notes in subsequent issues serve to identify seven of Hunt's unsigned contributions in Nos. 3-7, four of which relate to his friend Carlyle's current series of lectures on German literature. 13 There is also a short poem signed with Hunt's initials in No. 3. Hunt's involvement with the new paper was not limited to his original writing. As a veteran editor, he apparently gave Cole or Reynell some advice that caused problems on 20 April, when Cole noted in his journal that he returned home late becuase he was “engaged in remedying the mistakes [ altered from miscalculation] of Mr Hunt abt paper.” When the size of the Guide was increased with the third number, Cole may have turned to Hunt for further assistance. An unpublished letter from Hunt to Cole, dated from Reynell's on 7 June, reveals that he had been supplying extracts for the paper's “chat” and that he had been receiving the Morning Herald for that purpose:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little Pulteney Street— June 7. My dear Sir, I have written upon Hampton-Court; but am sorry to say that I am compelled to desist from my contributions to the chat,—the more so, as my necessity is abrupt, &amp; the paper may not be quite prepared for it. I must beg you therefore to stir your scissors a little furiously, to supply the omission. I have done what I could, with the greatest pleasure; but my new editorship swallows up all the time at my command, especially just now; &amp; I have found myself compelled these three last days, in spite of hopes to the contrary, to anticipate as much of the matter required for July's magazine as possible. I shall direct the newsman from this day, of course, to cease bringing me the Herald. 14 Ever truly yours, Leigh Hunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It appears, then, that Hunt's miscellaneous contributions to the Guide may have been substantial, but that they ceased with No. 7 because he needed to devote his energies to his “new editorship” of the Monthly Repository, which began with the issue for July 1837. 15 A receipt for £2.2.0 signed by Marianne Hunt and dated 6 June 1837 may have been for Hunt's last essay on “Hampton Court” in No. 8. 16 The following list includes all of Hunt's clearly identifiable contributions to the Guide. The titles alone should be sufficient to indicate that the eight essays and the single poem are vintage Leigh Hunt. Essays 1. “Leigh Hunt's Sunday Lecture.

      <field name="heading_text">ALTERATION OF LEADING WITHIN EDITIONS by Gillian G. M. Kyles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When, in his 1965-66 Lyell Lectures, Simon Nowell-Smith spoke of Victorian books in which “the leads had been removed, the type reimposed,” 1 he seemed to assume widespread awareness of those characteristics of reprinted editions. The occurrence of such features seems not, however, to have been widely remarked. I offer here some examples of changes in leading between impressions in order to draw attention to the practice and to stimulate others to identify more instances and to explore the nature and extent of the phenomenon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Changing the spacing between the lines is one way of addressing the frequent desire of publishers to bring out a book in several forms. At times this has been achieved by printing copies on different surfaces—on finer, thicker, or larger paper, for instance, or on vellum or some form of cloth. Complete resetting is always possible, especially when a different bibliographical format is needed, though sometimes reimposing the existing type serves equally well. Such reimposition takes place on a small scale when margins are adjusted in the transition between copies on dissimilar sizes of paper, but it occurs in a more extensive manner when type-pages are moved around to enable the printing of a different number of pages on a sheet. In Pope's Dunciad of 1728, for instance, the original duodecimo was immediately reimposed as an octavo; Scott's Life of John Dryden (1808) was first set up for octavo printing as volume 1 of Dryden's Works and then reimposed for production as an independent quarto. The practice of nineteenth-century American plate-makers who included signatures for more than one imposition likewise points to the custom of printing the same setting in different formats. A more complicated situation arises when the type metal is reused in units other than the original type-pages. In Pope's Works of 1735 and the Foulis Press's edition of Caesar's works of 1750, for instance, the same setting of individual lines is employed for both the folio and the quarto, though the number of lines on each page has been adjusted to compensate for the difference in leaf size. More intricate yet are the situations where the length of the original lines is changed as well. After the quarto 1762 edition of Fielding's Works was produced, the type was rearranged in a shorter measure for printing in octavo; the folio version of the 1733 tract The Case of the Planters of Tobacco in Virginia was also reimposed as an octavo, with each folio line divided into two. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The practice Nowell-Smith mentions is one way of adjusting existing type-pages—in this case, by reducing or completely removing intralinear leading. A scientific classic from the period of his interest offers a clear example of the procedure. Alfred Russel Wallace's Malay Archipelago was first published in two volumes by Macmillan in 1869. Printed by “R. Clay, Sons, and Taylor,” this set was reprinted once the same year but then, in 1872, the text was released as a “Third Edition” in a single volume. (It was reprinted six more times in London, and printed twice in the United States, before being replaced by another one-volume edition, the “Tenth,” in 1890.) To compress the 478 and 524 pages of the original books (and the 24 and 4 pages of preliminaries) into 16 preliminaries and 653 text pages, Clay and Taylor removed most of the leading; the number of lines per page subsequently rose from 26 to 41, and the 10-line measurement (for type with a face height of 3.4 mm) correspondingly decreased from 54 mm to 36 mm. Although the preliminaries were reset and the text of the Appendix (2.465-501 in the two-volume printings; pp. 599-633 in the later ones) was not modified at all, a sample comprising the first four chapters (or hundred pages in the first printing) shows that the type here is almost always the original type but with the leading reduced. The reasons for this kind of compression are obvious. The paper and binding costs of the one-volume edition would be considerably less than for several volumes, and the adjustment could be carried out more quickly than setting the text anew—and by an unskilled employee at lower wages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That the type is the same and not a line-for-line resetting is made clear from damage that occurs throughout. Examples from the first of the original volumes and from the single-volume reprint (I have checked the 1883 printing) include the following (listed, if applicable, by volume, page, and line):</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1.1.1 / 1.1 IF] top arm of “F” 1.8.15 / 6.8 posi-] bottom center of “o” 1.11.7 / 7.37 life] bottom center of “e”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1.20.14 / 13.32 100] bottom left of second “o” 1.25.16 / 17.1 toucans] top right of “o” 1.92.23 / 59.27 though . . . the] top right of “o”; bottom center of “e” 1.95.17 / 61.17 hands . . . and soon] both “d”s battered</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four minor resettings occur in the first four chapters, sometimes for reasons that are apparent. The original 29.18-20 is reset into four lines (here the cause is not evident); 47.25-49.3 are redone in order to accommodate a twenty-five-line wood-engraving occupying the right-hand side of the text column; 43.21-22, originally set loosely, are tightened into a single line; and 93.19 seems to have been reset with the deleterious loss of a comma at its end. In the latter instance it is clear that the adjacent lines were not reset, for the “y” of “They” in the previous line remains, as does the thickening of the “l” in “fleshly” below. In the pages beyond this sample, it appears that occasionally lines have been reset to avoid widows or to equalize facing pages. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Major literary works of the Victorian era also provide evidence of reprints in which the leading has been changed. The late Josiah Q. Bennett, Rare Book Cataloguer at the Lilly Library, pointed out to me leading reduction in Henry James's The Bostonians, likewise published in London by Macmillan but printed by R. and R. Clark in Edinburgh. In 1886 the novel was made available first in three volumes and then in one. The 702 pages of the main text were reduced to 449; the number of lines per page rose from 25 to 40, and the 10-line measurement (for type with a total face of 3.2 mm) shrank from 58 to 36 mm. The same phenomenon occurred in James's The Princess Casamassima that year, also printed by the Clarks and published by Macmillan: the 751 text pages in three volumes became 596 pages in one; the number of lines per page grew from 31 to 40, and the 10-line measure (for the same type as in The Bostonians ) dropped from 47 to 36 mm. Both novels, moreover, show similar type damage in the sample passages checked. 4 But the procedure was not universal for books even from this same author, printer, and publisher: in 1888, the single-volume editions of James's The Reverberator and The Aspern Papers were instead reset after their initial two-volume appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two ornithological works formerly in the H. Bradley Martin collection also display variation in leading. One of these is again from late nineteenth- century England; the other was produced much earlier in the century, in Germany. The first example, Thomas Littleton Powys Lilford's Notes on the Birds of Northamptonshire and Neighbourhood (2 vols.; London: R. H. Porter, 1895), appeared as a large-paper issue (limited to 100 copies) and a trade issue, both printed by Taylor and Francis. The large-paper copies have plates in two states and the wood-engravings on separate leaves; the trade issue has only one state of the plates, with the wood-engravings set into the text. Because the larger pages have more leading, each comprises only 31 lines of text, instead of the 34 lines on each page of the trade issue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The German publication offers an instance in which leading was clearly increased for the second impression. Teutsche Ornithologie (Darmstadt, 1800-11 and ca. 1837-41) is customarily attributed to Maritz Balthasar Bor[c]khausen, though it was the work of several authors—and is sometimes catalogued under the name of the illustrator, Johann Conrad Susemihl. Copies of the two printings in the Martin collection had identical type, with the exception of the first fascicle (where the text was completely reset) and fascicle 15 (where French text is added to the original German). The first printed page of fascicle 15 (containing the description of “Falco subbuteo”) is now accompanied by a French version on the facing page; because the French translation is longer, the leading in the German text has been increased to balance the size of the type pages. That adjustment results in seven fewer lines on the German page than in the first printing. The subsequent pages of the fascicle are treated differently: the French text is simply set below the existing German text, with no alteration of leading. No printer has been identified for the new impression; the single front wrapper bound in the Martin copy does not list one, and no copies in parts (with potentially revealing wrappers) are recorded. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Adjustment of leading also occurred in America, and in the twentieth century. I am indebted to Josiah Bennett and to Dr. Cecil K. Byrd, former Indiana University Librarian and later a consultant at the Lilly Library, for information about the practice at the Warner Press in Anderson, Indiana. In the 1930s, when Byrd worked as a printer's devil there, the press regularly kept standing the linotype slugs of every book and pamphlet, paged but in galley trays. If there was no further call for the type for nine months, it was then sent to the melting room. If, on the other hand, a reprint in a smaller format was warranted, a printer's devil took a long pair of tweezers and removed the three- or two-point leading, after which he repaged and transferred the type to regular formes. (The task obviously was easier with solid linotype pieces than with foundry type.) The same firm also did a great deal of job printing and would commonly print handbills in two sizes—2000 copies of the larger ones, and then, after removing the leading, 5000 copies of the small version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another American printer known to have used leading reduction was Carl Purington Rollins. John S. Kebabian, who worked as an assistant to Rollins in 1930s, recalls the removal of leading as a common practice. Kebabian's personal collection of antique tools includes many used in the printing trade, but he has been unable to identify the kind of tweezers that might have been used by the Warner Press. In any event, it may be that different printers had different ways of removing leading and that there was no tool manufactured specifically for the purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These glimpses of leading alterations in several countries over a couple of centuries suggest that systematic scrutiny would produce many more examples. The investigation would help fill gaps in the historical understanding of book production, but the inquiry also would undoubtedly raise new questions. If it is correct that in the nineteenth century first impressions of American editions, unlike English ones, tended to be printed from plates, one would anticipate turning up fewer examples of changed leading in American publications during that period—one of a number of hypotheses that analysis might test.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE CAMBRIDGE REVIEW by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is ironic that The Cambridge Review, A Journal of University Life and Thought (hereafter CR ) is rarely, if at all, cited in the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature. The tentativeness of my statement is a matter of scholarly caution, but the NCBEL 's list of periodical abbreviations does not include the CR, and in every instance where I have sought in it a reference to an article from the CR I have come away empty-handed. It is not only the compilers of the NCBEL (myself included) who have neglected the journal, for most other bibliographers, biographers, and editors of the works of this essayist or that poet have been equally remiss in ignoring essays, poems, reviews, obituary notices, and miscellaneous information of all kinds to be found there. The neglect may result from the apparent scarcity of full sets: the British Union-Catalogue of Periodicals lists complete runs only in three Cambridge libraries and the British Library, and the nineteen American holdings recorded by the Union List of Serials include only one set of all the numbers. By calling attention to representative pieces from the periodical, I hope to resurrect interest in the CR —even as it now seems to have met its final demise. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Some of the overlooked materials are noteworthy for their authorship. Over the years a number of uncollected poems appeared in the pages of CR, many of them written by members of the University, but some by writers known far from Cambridge. When the young Thackeray visited Weimar in 1830, he wrote a drinking song and translated a passage from Goethe's Faust that he titled “Rosa”; Walter Vulpius quotes these in “Thackeray in Weimar” ( The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, 53 [April 1897]: 920-928, but he does not mention another poem from that time claimed for Thackeray in the CR. In a short piece entitled “Thackeray and Goethe” (71 [29 Oct. 1949]: 68), Trevor Jones reprints a poem signed “Leonora Splutch” from Das Chaos, a weekly magazine edited by Goethe's daughter-in-law Ottilie. Jones states that “The secret of the authorship of this poem was not divulged; but there is no reasonable doubt that it was written by Thackeray.” With the poem Jones prints a Thackeray drawing of Goethe: SB 52, Page 194. Tartary's famous for Timour, America boasts of her Penn; Goethe's the glory of Weimar, Now standing alone among men. Clapham's honours are fled; if it had 'em They've taken up other abodes. Wet Scotland is famed for M'Adam Who's called “The Colossus of Rhodes.” In London we've Brougham and we've Malthus, And Cobbett, a glorious name. Our Smoky metropolis shall thus Long darken the annals of Fame. We've Hunt, and the Duke of St. Albans; Miss Kemble, whose talent's a chouse. The glories of Chelsea are small buns, Of Hammersmith, Brandenburg House. Brunel has half scooped out a tunnel To join muddy Essex to Kent. Great Dublin has greater O'Connell Who started the Catholic Rent. Tartary's famous for Timour; Penn's praises all languages sound; Goethe's the glory of Weimar. Where now can his fellow be found? The CR also provides some otherwise unrecorded verses from Charles Stuart Calverley, who according to his modern editor Hilda D. Spear excelled in “light verse, parody and pastiche” ( The English Poems of Charles Stuart Calverley, 1974, p. 9). Spear does not note eight parodic lines that Calverley (who attended Harrow) added to an anonymous versifier's poem. I quote the entire item, which appears as an editorial comment in CR 23 (1 May 1902), 279: A few lines by Calverley have been recently discovered on the back of a copy of Latin verses, entitled `Fair Fidele.' The two first stanzas are in the writing of the versifier, and Calverley evidently completed the poem. When howling winds and beating rain In tempest shake thy sylvan cell, Or 'midst the chase on every plane, The tender thought on thee shall dwell. Each lonely scene shall thee restore, For thee the tear be duly shed; Beloved, till life can charm no more, And mourned, till Pity's self be dead. What though the earth thy ashes wraps, And owls around the cold gave hoot?, Though unromantic prentice chaps Ramp o'er the spot with hobnailed boot? Thy memory still our thought employs, Still thy meek virtues we'll rehearse; And quantities of Harrow boys Shall turn thee into Latin verse. The CR also contains unnoticed work by more recent writers. Bernard Stone's bibliography appended to Robert Greacen's The World of C. P. Snow (1962) lists one piece on Snow in the periodical but nothing by him there. In fact, Snow contributed an essay, “A Use for Popular Scientists” (52 [10 June 1931]: 492-493) and three reviews: of Sir James Jeans, The Stars in Their Courses (52 [29 May 1931]: 452); H. G. Wells, Autobiography (vol. 1: 56 [19 Oct. 1934]: 27; vol. 2: 56 [30 Nov. 1934]: 148), reprinted in the more accessible The Cambridge Mind, Ninety Years of the CAMBRDIGE REVIEW, 1879-1969 (1970), 280-285; and Aldous Huxley, After Many a Summer (61 [28 Oct. 1939]: 53-54). Eben E. Bass includes a 1959 article by Snow about Huxley in his Aldous Huxley: An Annotated Bibliography of Criticism (1981), but he does not mention Snow's review. Letters to editors usually are not listed in the bibliographies of writers, but these can be of great interest. B. J. Kirkpatrick's Soho bibliography of E. M. Forster's writings (1965; rev. 1968) admirably records a letter and ensuing correspondence in the CR over the nomination of the Chancellor for Cambridge University, but it ignores an even more interesting one. On 30 January 1948 Forster, writing from King's College, Cambridge, complained of noisy aircraft. The letter was printed in the next number of the CR (69 [7 Feb. 1948]: 310, 312): Would any of your readers care to co-operate in an attempt to abate the nuisance of aircraft over Cambridge? Sufferers may be surprised to learn that exercising over this area is prohibited, and that all, or nearly all, of the planes which disturb us do so contrary to regulations. I understand the Ministry would be willing to make enquiries, provided adequate information is supplied. What is required is the name and address of the complainant, the date and hour when the plane was seen, and also its number- or, if that cannot be deciphered, a clear description of it. Both our Burgesses have been so good as to interest themselves in the matter. Complaints should be addressed to either of them at the House of Commons, and will be forwarded to the Ministry provided they are properly documented. This cry from the heart brought but one answer. From Jesus College came A. P. Rossiter's agreement with Forster, but with the objection that the burden of proof should not be on the complainant, i.e. the private citizen. His letter, published in the next CR (14 Feb. 1948: 338), concluded, “I ask, because I feel uncertain that the incidence of burglaries would be much reduced if the burglar- ee were left to write a memorandum to the Home Office, giving the time and place and the burglar's apparent appearance.” The rest is silence, but not in the sky above Cambridge. Through its innovative section devoted to reviews of books of all kinds, the CR list of contributors also serves as a roll of great teachers and scholars at Cambridge University: A. W. Verrall, E. M. W. Tillyard, G. M. Trevelyan, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, Sir Herbert Butterfield, Sir Ernest Baker, Bertrand Russell, Muriel Bradbrook, Joan Bennett, Sir S. C. Roberts, Brian Downs, T. R. Henn, M. R. James, F. L. Lucas, Joseph Needham, I. A. Richards, Sir Charles Percy Snow, Raymond Williams, Basil Willey, D. A. Winstanley. Add, too, the names of W. H. O. Rouse and Sir Shane Leslie. Bibliographies of scholars, typically appended to festschriften, are often incomplete; again, examination of the CR provides a way of ameliorating that deficiency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Other neglected pieces are notable for their subjects (though these too are often by writers important in their own right). For instance, Andor Gomme's reviews of William Faulkner's A Fable (77 [8 Oct. 1955]: 9) and Faulkner's County: Tales of Yoknapatawpha County (77 [5 Nov. 1955]: 139) have not been recorded. Gomme writes of The Fable that it “is precisely the book which one did not expect from Faulkner; and it is a book which he, perhaps, can ill afford. Too big a writer for it to be taken as a matter of course, he may yet not be big enough for it to make no difference.” Of the anthology of Faulkner's writings, he concludes that “it must be admitted that few who have not enjoyed meeting Faulkner's county will get much fun out of coming to know his world.” Besides reviews of new literature, the CR contains essays on earlier writers and works. What I conceive to be an important talk on Wordsworth, one printed in the 29 April 1950 number (71: 464-466), is overlooked by Elton F. Henley and David H. Stam, editors of Wordsworthian Criticism, 1945-1964: An Annotated Bibliography (1965). The address was by George Macaulay Trevelyan, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a name with which to conjure. The bibliography does list Wordsworth at Cambridge, an account of the centenary meetings, but there is no explicit mention of Macaulay or of Ernest Alfred Benians, Master of St John's College, Cambridge, who spoke on “St. John's College in Wordsworth's Time.” Benians's address is printed on pages 2-10 of Wordsworth at Cambridge, the full title of which is A Record of the Commemoration Held at St. John's College, Cambridge in April, 1950, published at the Cambridge University Press in that year; Trevelyan's address, on pages 21-26. In 1980 Trevelyan's daughter, Mary Moorman, wrote a Memoir of her father in which she tells of his love of Wordsworth's poetry; her remarks (see the index) should be added to Trevelyan on Wordsworth. An important discussion especially striking for its omission from the NCBEL is that over the authorship of Observations upon a Late Libel, which its editor Hugh Macdonald attributed in 1940 to George Savile, 1st Marquis of Halifax. The ascription was attacked by B. Behrens of Newham College in a piece titled “Pseudo-Halifax” in the 19 November 1940 CR (62: 107-108). Macdonald replied at length on the 29th (62: 146-147), and Miss Behrens, having been shown the proofs of Macdonald's reply, answered in the same number (147-148). Herbert Butterfield joined in and professed polite doubt about the attribution, as did Brian Wormald of Peterhouse (148-149). It was not until 7 January 1941 that Macdonald answered his critics and at that time appealed to the authority of H. C. Foxcroft, the biographer of Halifax, who supported his view in a signed statement (182-183). Immediately upon this another scholar entered the arena, Miss Muriel Bradbrook of Girton College (183-184), whose help had been acknowledged in Macdonald's introduction. Miss Behrens took issue with Miss Bradbrook and again with Macdonald on 24 January 1941 (202), but it was one of Miss Bradbrook's friends and colleagues, the eminent historian Miss Helen M. Cam, who had the last word, a most pertinent and clear-sighted analysis of the rules of evidence in problems of this kind (203). Miss Cam posited that “To begin with, by historical criteria an anonymous ascription of authorship has no evidential value as to the fact of authorship, and twice nought is nought”; she then rehearsed and refuted the arguments of those accepting the ascription. Anyone interested in Halifax or in matters of attribution will want to know of and study this correspondence. The letters by Herbert Butterfield and Miss Bradbrook may have seemed ephemeral to the compilers of the writings of both scholars, for they are absent from those compilations. Volume 86 of CR (1964-65) provides a number of examples of consequential discussions that have not been recorded. In those pages Roy Stone (unknown to fame, unlike the two other writers to be discussed) wrote a provocative article titled “Dr. Johnson: Philologist or Philosopher?” (14 Nov. 1964: 114-119, 121), in which Wittgenstein's name appears a number of times, as well as those of other philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and writers on legal matters. The NCBEL is, of course, selective, but Stone's article, important enough to deserve notice by Johnsonians, may have been unknown to the compiler of that entry. It is also not recorded in James L. Clifford and Donald J. Greene's Samuel Johnson: A Survey and Bibliography of Critical Studies (1970). Also in that volume is Arthur Pollard's piece “Mrs. Gaskell's Short Stories” (8 May 1965: 374-377, 379), which became the first half of Chapter 7, “Short Stories and Novels,” of his Mrs. Gaskell (1966, pp. 172-187). Indeed, the first seven paragraphs of CR are repeated in the book, with only minor changes in phrasing. Major differences, however, occur beginning in paragraph nine, a discussion of the story “A Dark Night's Work” that is considerably expanded in the book. Paragraphs eleven through thirteen are identical, and then Pollard comes to the story “Six Weeks in Heppenheim,” which he could not rate quite so highly as Mrs. Gaskell, an opinion not expressed in CR. The rest of the paragraph (two paragraphs in the book) is, again, verbatim. The concluding paragraph in CR becomes the concluding paragraph of the whole chapter in the book. Pollard's is the outstanding name in studies of Mrs. Gaskell; his piece deserves to be known by scholars interested in Mrs. Gaskell's writings. A third item of interest in that volume is by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, who with Edmund Blunden contributes pieces to the CR on the fiftieth anniversary of Rupert Brooke's death. As Christopher Hassall's biography of Brooke had come out earlier in 1964, Sir Geoffrey takes occasion to offer some comments on that biography. Sir Geoffrey stated in the introduction to A Bibliography of Rupert Brooke (1959) that he and Brooke “entered the same house at Rugby in the same term” (15); Brooke was fourteen then, and he and Keynes remained close friends until Brooke's death at twenty-seven. Hassall's biography of Brooke was dedicated to Keynes, and, indeed, it had fallen to Sir Geoffrey to complete the biography on Hassall's death. Sir Geoffrey edited Brooke's poetry in 1946 and a collection of his letters in 1968. Because of this long and deep connection, Keynes's piece in CR (12 June 1965: 482-483) demands inclusion in a bibliography. Indeed, the Preface to the selected letters and the Bibliographical Preface that follows it together constitute a rifaciamento of the CR piece, with some passages verbatim or nearly so. I limit quotation from the CR to Sir Geoffrey's concluding paragraph: When Brooke died it was not primarily the poet that his friends mourned. It was rather the sense that the light of a shining personality and intellect had been extinguished. His poetic faculties might have increased in power—more probably they would have waned with the growth of more critical and scholarly perceptions. His creativeness might have taken quite other turns, but he would have left his mark in some unexpected way on the life of England. Finally, one can also mine from the CR reviews of important criticism and critical editions. B. J. Kirkpatrick's Soho bibliography of Edmund Blunden (1979) lists one piece from the CR, on Rupert Brooke's poetry (86 [12 June 1965]: 483-484), but neglects Blunden's review of Frank Kendon's Seatonian Prize Poem, The Flawless Stone (64 [24 April 1943]: 270). The review ends, “The sensibilities of the poet have chosen his speech and his cadences in this and in other parts of his work, and if the poem is one more of those that `prove nothing' it is one of those also which gives the listener a deep desire to encounter life with the freshness of spirit so eloquent in it all.” Similarly, Susan Vander Closter's 1985 reference guide to secondary materials on Joyce Cary and Lawrence Durrell fails to record J. B. Broadbent's review of Cary's Art and Reality, the 1956 Clark Lectures (80 [18 Oct. 1958]: 49, 51). Broadbent states that “These are the finest Clark Lectures since Mr Forster's Aspects of the Novel in 1927 (not that the competition in those thirty years has been fierce).” Frederick P. W. McDowell's E. M. Forster: An Annotated Bibliography of Writings about Him (1976) includes a 1975 article by George Savidis in the Times Literary Supplement, but Savidis's review of Forster's Two Cheers for Democracy in the 1 December 1951 CR (73 [Dec. 1951]: 182, 184) is not listed. The review is titled “Our Mutual Friend” and begins with the statements that “No suitable label has yet been found for Mr E. M. Forster” and that “it has been suggested lately that, in the absence of a single word to describe him, Mr Forster's own description of André Gide, in his note on Gide's Death, could be applied, without modification, to Mr Forster himself.” Savidis goes on to suggest that despite the affinities between the two writers, “yet in at least one essential respect the two men stand very much apart.” Forster had described Gide as a humanist, “not of other ages, but of this one.” The humanist, according to Forster, must have “a belief in the human race,” and it is in this characteristic that the two men differ, for Forster believed in the human race while Gide did not. Savidis concludes by stating that the book “is not only his [Forster's] positive testimony to his beliefs, it is also one of the best testimonies to our dignity as human beings.” Henley and Stam's bibliography of writings on Wordsworth lists sixteen reviews of Ben Ross Schneider's Wordsworth's Cambridge Education (1957) but omits the long and thoughtful one by John Beer in 79 [7 June 1958]: 618-621—even though it does cite another book Beer reviewed at the same time. Willis J. Buckingham's 1970 bibliography of Emily Dickinson for the years 1850-1966 includes Thomas H. Johnson's 1955 biography and six reviews of it. Arthur Sale's highly critical review (77 [19 May 1956]: 599, 601-602) is not among them, though Buckingham does cite two other pieces by him from the CR. In one of them, his review of Johnson's edition of The Letters of Emily Dickinson (80 [21 Feb. 1959]: 357-358), Sale continues his assault on the biography: he speaks of the “editor, whose Introduction is as good, but too brief, as his `interpretative biography' of 1955 was undistinguished, and too long.” Students of Henry James can likewise benefit by turning to the CR. Joan Bennett reviews F. O. Matthieson's edition of The Note Books of Henry James (70 [23 Oct. 1948]: 38, 40) and Janet Adam Smith's Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record of Friendship and Criticism (70 [19 Feb. 1949]: 396); neither review has been included in the bibliographies of criticism of James. Andor Gomme's review of F. R. Leavis's D. H. Lawrence: Novelist (77 [12 Nov. 1955]: 151, 153) should be read in the light of his later remarks about Leavis on Lawrence in his Attitudes to Criticism (1966). In the review Gomme describes Leavis's work as “a tiresome heavyweight of a book, lumpily constructed, stodgily written, and, though strikingly poor in illuminating vocabulary, full of Dr. Leavis's familiar array of quips and sneers and jibes and jeers. I can scarcely imagine many who are not already hardened Leavisites or established Lawrentians giving it the attention it deserves.” Another review pertaining to Lawrence, W. W. Robson's long (almost eight columns) assessment of Graham Hough's The Dark Sun: A Study of D. H. Lawrence (78 [1 June 1957] 638-641, 643) is mandatory reading, particularly to complement Robson's lengthy discussion of Lawrence in his Modern English Literature (1970) and specifically of Women in Love in The Modern Age (edited by Boris Ford, 1961; this article reprinted in Robson's Critical Essays, 1966). Robson has nothing but scorn for Hough's criticism. Bibliographers and other students of literary history have much to gain from scrutiny of the Cambridge Review. Those who ignore the periodical do so at their risk.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A SYSTEM OF MANUSCRIPT TRANSCRIPTION by David L. Vander Meulen and G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There has never been a single standard convention for the transcription of manuscript texts, and it is not likely that there ever will be one, given the great variety of textual complications that manuscripts—from all times and places—can present. Nevertheless, there are certain basic principles and procedures that can reasonably be regarded as essential underpinnings for whatever specific scheme seems best suited to a particular situation. The plan we offer here can easily be adapted to handle details not explicitly mentioned; its fundamental approach is, we believe, applicable to all circumstances. We devised it for use in our edition of Samuel Johnson's Translation of Sallust (1993), and Vander Meulen expanded it in 1997 for his transcription of the Virginia manuscript of Faulkner's Mosquitoes (in his and Thomas L. McHaney's facsimile edition of that manuscript). 1 One of its merits, in our view, is that it is simple and straightforward; it can therefore (unlike many systems that have been proposed) be explained in little space.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First, however, we must make clear that by “transcription” we mean the effort to report—insofar as typography allows—precisely what the textual inscription of a manuscript consists of. 2 Obviously a transcription cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript—all letters, punctuation, superscripts, canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on. Judgment is necessarily involved in deciding what is in fact present, as when an ambiguously formed character resembles two different letters; but the transcriber's goal is to make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed at each point. This definition of transcription will seem obvious to many people; the reason we make a point of insisting on it is that numerous discussions of the subject, including some of the most influential, allow for making certain classes of alteration when transcribing manuscript texts, as if a conscious program of alteration is compatible with the concept of transcription.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For example, Samuel Eliot Morison's often-cited comments in the Harvard Guide to American History (1954) describe a so-called “Literal Method” in which silent alterations can be made to correct slips of the pen, unclear punctuation, and idiosyncratic capitalization. Mary-Jo Kline, in A Guide to Documentary Editing (1987; revised 1998), describes “diplomatic transcription” as allowing some standardization, alteration of punctuation, expansion of “ambiguous or archaic” abbreviations, and the like, though she adds that “none of these corrections or emendations is made silently” (p. 155). But neither in this discussion nor in her subsequent treatment of “inclusive texts,” “expanded transcriptions,” and “clear texts” does she suggest that the manner of recording textual evidence constitutes a very different level of consideration from decisions about what words, spellings, and punctuation are to appear in the text itself (that is, the text as distinct from the editor's comments and symbols). Even Michael Hunter's “How to Edit a Seventeenth-Century Manuscript: Principles and Practice” ( The Seventeenth Century, 10 [1995], 277-310), which includes many useful observations, does not clearly distinguish these logically distinct matters. After eliminating “type-facsimiles” as an unsatisfactory substitute for photographic or electronic images, he does not consider any other form of unemended transcription and proceeds to discuss various kinds of “editorial intervention,” often aimed at modernization. And Michael E. Stevens and Steven B. Burg's Editing Historical Documents: A Handbook of Practice (1997), after stating that in transcription “editors strive to represent original documents faithfully” (p. 71), outlines the “textual changes made by editors when transcribing,” which include both “silent” and “overt” emendations (p. 72). 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any kind of editorial change may at times be appropriate in a critical text, and it is not our purpose here to discuss principles of emendation, which have already received extensive coverage. 4 Our present point—a fundamental one that seems to be often overlooked in treatments of manuscript transcription—is simply that editorial alterations produce critical texts. All editors have to make a basic decision at the outset of each act of editing: whether to offer their readers a faithful transcription (as faithful as a typographic rendition and accompanying explanation allow) or an emended text (which incorporates alterations that reflect a particular editorial goal). In the latter case, the extent and nature of the emendations may vary considerably from edition to edition, but the result is still a critical text. A single edition might contain both transcriptions and critical texts, but no single text can be both at once, because they are mutually exclusive genres: a text cannot simultaneously be unemended and emended. 5 When one speaks of methods of transcription, therefore, one is talking about the mechanics for reporting what actually appears in a manuscript; one is not considering making changes in the manuscript text. The present discussion takes for granted that the text to be reported is precisely the text of a document; what we are proposing is a way to carry out that task.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When a manuscript is a clean fair copy, with no cancellations, interlineations, marginalia, or other indications of revision, there is virtually nothing for an editor to decide about how to present a transcription (as opposed to the inevitable decisions about how to read certain unclear formations of letters or punctuation). But since manuscripts frequently do show signs of alteration, often very complicated ones, editors commonly must consider how best to make clear the complexities of a documentary text. If an editor chooses not to present a type-facsimile (which attempts to imitate in type the relative positions, sizes, and other visual characteristics of the handwritten words), 6 there are essentially three sets of presentational issues that one must think about (and that provide a means for classifying transcription systems as one encounters them).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(1) Words or symbols. One may use either ordinary language or symbols to explain what is found in a manuscript; one could, for instance, say “interlined” to describe a word inserted above the line, or one could use an upward-pointing arrow (or a caret, or a particular kind of bracket) to mean the same thing. An example of the former is Fredson Bowers's Whitman's Manuscripts (1955) and of the latter is The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson (ed. William H. Gilman et al., 1960-82). The advantage of words, obviously, is that the meaning is immediately clear, without the necessity for learning a system of symbols; the advantage of symbols, on the other hand, is their efficiency in saving space. If the amount of revision is small, there may be no necessity for saving space; in any case, one must always weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in relation to the nature and extent of the alterations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(2) Inclusive or clear text. Regardless of whether an editor uses words or symbols to express textual complications, there is still the question of whether that information is to be conveyed within a linear text (an “inclusive” text) or whether it is to be presented in an appended list or set of notes, leaving the text free of intrusions (a “clear” text). These do not represent two differ- ent approaches to editing but are rather two ways of reporting identical information. The Emerson edition mentioned above is an example of an inclusive text (though with some textual information in notes), the Whitman of a clear text. Inclusive texts offer the reader an approximation of the experience of reading the manuscript: the difficulties of reading an inclusive text (when there are any difficulties) are analogous to the difficulties of reading the manuscript. 7 Clear texts with appended notes, though they conceal no evidence, do not reflect the original quite as directly; but they may on occasion be desirable nonetheless, especially when the text partakes of the nature of the literary essay or of some other genre that a wide audience may be expected to wish to read only in its final (or some earlier “finished”) form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(3) Forward or backward chronology. Either choice from the previous two pairs can be joined with a decision either to start the record with the earliest reading (followed by the successive revisions in chronological order) or to start it with the final one (followed by a chronological account from the beginning up to that point). Although any combination is theoretically possible, certain combinations are more common than others in practice. Thus clear texts are likely to contain final readings, with the appended notes recording the earlier ones, 8 whereas inclusive texts frequently give variant readings in straight chronological order, first to last. Indeed, the length to which some inclusive plans go to delineate every stage, beginning with the first, is illustrated by Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts's edition of Billy Budd, Sailor (1962): a canceled word or passage is printed twice, first without any designation of deletion and then with such a designation, since the word or words in question first existed in their undeleted state before they were lined through or otherwise canceled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The system we propose here uses words rather than symbols and places them in an inclusive text, with the variants at any point normally recorded in chronological order beginning with the first. We have also tried to make the system as simple and convenient as possible, without misrepresenting any complexity that manuscript texts may offer. In order to accommodate simul- taneously those who are interested in the process of revision and those who wish to read only the final text, we have adopted as our fundamental rule that all stages prior to the final one are recorded and described in brackets; as a result, one can read the final text simply by skipping all the bracketed material. This fact, along with our policy of using ordinary prose rather than symbols to explain the placement of alterations, perhaps constitutes all one needs to know in order to implement our system (and one needs no instructions at all to read a text presented this way). But because we have given thought to the application of this approach to a number of specific situations and have worked out some standard wording, it seems potentially useful to offer here a few further details.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The basic categories of alterations to be recorded are simply stated: material can be canceled, or it can be added—or these processes can occur together. In addition, features such as blots, lines, unusual spacing, anomalous inking, and missing portions of leaves may require identification through editorial comment. It is helpful to differentiate reports of alterations from explanations of what the reviser meant by the change—and to record only the former in the bracketed notes within a transcription. Though even an apparently simple description relies on interpretation and the two activities cannot be neatly separated, the consistency and brevity of the notes will be enhanced, and the final text of the transcribed manuscript easier to read, to the extent that this distinction can be honored. In a similar vein, the editor should proceed cautiously when deciding whether to report multiple changes within a single annotation. Reporting the alterations separately would not be to deny that they may have resulted from a single act of revision, but combining them might go beyond the editor's intention by implying that their origins were linked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Basic features. In our system, square brackets surround editorial records and comments; braces are used for the next level of parenthesis when commentary is required for alterations within alterations. The editorial statements are italicized and thereby differentiated from words quoted from the document, which consequently do not need quotation marks. (Italics are not common in manuscripts; if they—or, for that matter, brackets—do occur in text being included within the editorial brackets, the system allows the editor to describe the situation.) Generally the basic element in each editorial comment is a participle, such as canceled or inserted, and it normally follows specification of the affected text (as in: [objec canceled ] or [ next word inserted ]). Editorial comments usually refer either to the actual point in the text where they appear or to the text that immediately follows. But sometimes, to reflect the order of inscription, they may refer more appropriately to the immediately preceding text, as when only certain letters of a word need to be discussed and the revision in question occurred after the opening letter(s) of the word had been inscribed; in these cases the word the is used as an adjectival modifier of the cited text in order to make clear that the reference is to something already reported (as in: Mrs [ the final s inserted ] Weisman). (If, on the other hand, the opening letter or letters of a word are written over a previous false start, the editorial comment precedes the word— as in: [ first letter of next word written over s].)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When individual marks of punctuation are cited, they are best referred to by name (as in: [ comma canceled ]) so that they are not confused with editorial comment. Although indication of line divisions (which would be essential in a type- facsimile) may not always seem necessary, especially when the transcription is accompanied by a facsimile of the document, the editor may decide that the circumstances of a particular text make the practice appropriate (and then would mark each line-end with a bar or solidus). One instance in which such a record can be especially useful (though at the expense of introducing into the transcription a mark not in the manuscript text) is for words that begin at the end of one line (concluding it with a hyphen) and finish on the next; the typographical symbol (as in: pre-|sent) can clarify why a word has been inscribed in fragments. The edition of Sallust notes line divisions, whereas that of Faulkner does not, except for line-end hyphenation. Uncertain readings within the editorial comments can be indicated by a prefatory question mark (as in: [?kind canceled ]). Blots, tears, and other damage to the manuscript (whether caused by the inscriber or by the subsequent vicissitudes of the document) need not enter the transcription unless they affect the text; but they would of course be described in a detailed account of the physical features of the manuscript, prepared as an accompaniment to the transcription.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cancellation. We use the word canceled as the encompassing term for text that has in some way been designated for removal. It comprehends methods such as blotting, lining through, annotating, erasing, and cutting— any of which can be stipulated should the editor deem more elaborate description appropriate (as, for instance, for a procedure that is anomalous within a given manuscript). Canceled seems preferable to deleted because the common use of the latter in computer terminology has meant that deletion is increasingly thought of as removing the physical traces of the original text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addition. The word interlined designates one of the most common forms of addition, an inscription made above (or when specified as such, below) the usual line of writing. (An editor could include above in the description, but in most instances doing so would be unlikely to add to the commonly perceived sense of the participle alone.) A related term, inserted, when used by itself means that new characters or words have been added within an existing line (as evidenced by spacing, the shapes of the letterforms, the nature of the ink or lead, and similar characteristics); it may also be combined with descriptive phrases to identify other additions that are not interlineations (as in: inserted in left margin ).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cancellation with addition. Combinations of addition and cancellation tend to offer the most complicated situations to report, though the one that is probably most common—an interlineation above a cancellation—is rela- tively straightforward (as in: [ next word interlined above canceled the]). When a passage is moved from one place to another, the transcription should report the presence of the excerpt at both sites. In accord with the goal of presenting the final form of the manuscript text, the complete wording would be given at its new location (with a bracketed note explaining that it had been moved there and identifying its original position), while at its former site another note would record its earlier presence, indicate its new location, and give perhaps the first and last words of the passage (see the examples below). Careful wording can also distinguish two phenomena that are similar to each other: the transformation of one inscription into another (reported by a statement such as: [ the final e altered from or]), and what is often called “overwriting,” the superimposition of one inscription on another (recorded as: [ first letter of next word written over a quotation mark ]).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Examples. All but two of the following editorial descriptions (along with some of the adjacent transcription) have been drawn from the editions of Johnson's Sallust and Faulkner's Mosquitoes to illustrate situations commonly encountered in transcribing manuscripts. The three largest categories have been subdivided (into groupings that are not mutually exclusive) to help in locating particular kinds of changes. A fourth category covers miscellaneous other features, such as blots and tears 9 or matters of spacing and inking. Each example (except the two hypothetical ones at the end) is followed in parentheses by the page number of the corresponding passage in the Johnson or Faulkner edition, which might be usefully consulted for photographic illustrations of the texts being reported on here. The samples also include some complex situations that are unique to Mosquitoes but that show how difficult situations can be handled within the proposed system. It is important to emphasize, however, that the principles informing the system are a more important guide than these examples, not only because the number of possible situations is countless but also because other wording may be equally effective.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">2 Typescripts less often than manuscripts require transcription in addition to photographic reproduction; but typescripts do frequently pose the same kinds of problems as manuscripts when they contain revisions (whether made in handwriting or typewriting). The word “manuscripts,” as used here, is meant to refer to such typescripts as well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 A more detailed historical survey of approaches to transcription (with comments on many specific editions) can be found in Tanselle's “The Editing of Historical Documents,” Studies in Bibliography, 31 (1978), 1-56 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 451-506, and Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing [1990], pp. 218-272). See also the Kline and Hunter works mentioned above; the Stevens-Burg book gives photographic or xerographic reproductions from a number of editions. Tanselle has also discussed the relation of the European interest in manuscript versions to the Anglo-American tradition of recording manuscript alterations; see “Critical Editions, Hypertexts, and Genetic Criticism,” Romanic Review, 86 (1995), 581-593 (reprinted in Literature and Artifacts [1998], pp. 258-271).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">6 A good example of this approach is Shelley and His Circle (ed. Kenneth Neill Cameron, Donald H. Reiman, et al., 1961-), in which interlinear insertions are printed above the line in smaller type, canceled words have a line through them, and so on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7 But when an editor complicates a text by the insertion of textual evidence drawn from more than one document, the result cannot be justified on these grounds (though possibly it can on other grounds). The much discussed “synoptic” text in the 1984 edition of Joyce's Ulysses (ed. Hans Walter Gabler et al.) is an example of this kind of text and is thus not an instance of inclusive manuscript transcription; Tanselle has elaborated this point in “Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology,” SB, 44 (1991), 83-143 (esp. pp. 108-109 and p. 139, note 91), and in “Critical Editions, Hypertexts, and Genetic Criticism” (see note 3 above), pp. 588-590 [265-268].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 Bowers's Whitman edition, mentioned above, is an example; and some of his critical editions offer an extension of this approach. In his Hawthorne and William James editions, for example, he presents clear reading texts that are critically emended; these texts, though obviously not intended to be documentary transcriptions, are furnished with appended notes that allow the reader to reconstruct manuscript alterations. In the Hawthorne, these notes explain the alterations in words (see The House of the Seven Gables, 1965); for the James, Bowers created a system that relies on symbols and abbreviations (see Pragmatism, 1975). The latter system, the product of Bowers's long attention to matters of textual apparatus, has had some influence, despite the fact that he required fifty pages for its full exposition; see his “Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants,” SB, 29 (1976), 212-264.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">BOWERS'S PRINCIPLES AT FIFTY by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The official publication date of Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description was 30 December 1949; the present volume of Studies in Bibliography, dated 1999, therefore appears close to the fiftieth anniversary of that classic work. The occasion cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed in these pages, given the fact that Bowers founded Studies and edited its first forty-five volumes. The book that Bowers wrote quickly, early in his career, in order to settle for himself the procedures that he would follow in his own descriptive work on Restoration drama, was recognized as a landmark when it first came out and has been a highly visible presence ever since. It has been constantly referred to, sometimes quarreled with, and occasionally supplemented—and, through it all, has been profoundly influential.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is not necessary here to survey the origins of the Principles, its initial reception, and its subsequent fortunes, because these topics have already been treated. In 1985, for example, at the time of Bowers's eightieth birthday, David Vander Meulen wrote an illuminating account, which included analysis of the reviews, entitled “The History and Future of Bowers's Principles ” ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 79: 197-219; reprinted in the pamphlet Fredson Bowers at Eighty ). Vander Meulen's Engelhard Lecture of 1988, Where Angels Fear to Tread, and mine of 1992, A Description of Descriptive Bibliography (also in SB, 45: 1-30, and now included in Literature and Artifacts, 1998), provide assessments of descriptive bibliography in the wake of the Principles. And in The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (1993; also published in SB, 46: 1-154), I tried to explain the context out of which the Principles emerged and to assess its legacy (see, in particular, pp. 40-48, 134-137).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since then, the Principles has become more readily available and broadly circulated than ever before by virtue of its 1994 publication as a relatively inexpensive paperback (bearing the joint British-American imprint of St. Paul's Bibliographies and Oak Knoll Press). The Oak Knoll catalogue for Spring 1999 lists it on the same page as McKerrow's Introduction and Gaskell's New Introduction, under the heading “A Trilogy of Standard Bibliographical References”: for the first time it shares a publisher with these two other essential books. And now that the monographic publications of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia are distributed by Oak Knoll, the Principles is also being advertised for the first time alongside the products of the society that Bowers helped to found fifty-two years ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over the years there have been a number of articles modifying or refining various aspects of the Principles (the major ones are listed in SB, 40 [1987], 3-5), and the process continues today. The ongoing dialogue centering on the book is perhaps symbolized by B. J. McMullin's three suggestions for its revision (in the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand's Bulletin, 15 [1991], 53-59) and my recent response to his points (23 [1999], 107-109). As befits a classic, there has now also been some investigation of its textual history. Rolf Du Rietz in 1998 reported his discovery of two corrections made in the 1962 Russell &amp; Russell reprinting—corrections not present in the recent paperback, which was reproduced from the original Princeton 1949 printing. (See “Textual Variation in Bowers's Principles: A Short Note,” Text [Uppsala], 5.2: 118-119.) David Vander Meulen, in the present volume, investigates further the text of the Principles, along with that of other bibliographical classics. And my main contribution to this volume, on the treatment of typesetting and presswork in bibliographical description, can be seen, along with Vander Meulen's, as homage to Bowers in this anniversary year. More articles will appear in the future, as well as volumes that supplement or extend or condense or popularize the Principles —and all will be testimony to its enduring vitality.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">REVISION IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSICS: “McKERROW” and “BOWERS” by David L. Vander Meulen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A major theme of twentieth-century bibliographical investigation and editorial procedure has been the need to locate and examine all forms of a work in order to understand its history. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of one landmark in that scholarly tradition, Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description, it seems fitting to turn some bibliographical classics on themselves by applying techniques their authors advocated. Principles itself is an obvious candidate for such consideration; so also is a book with which it was linked from the time of its publication, R. B. McKerrow's An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students. Bowers's volume, first published by Princeton University Press in late 1949, has been reprinted a number of times, without any acknowledgment that changes have occurred; McKerrow's, originally published by Oxford University Press in 1927, was reprinted the following year (and often since) with “a few corrections and small additions,” but without any specification of what was altered. Knowing what happened to these works over their lifetimes may at the least satisfy curiosity. If Bowers and McKerrow were right about the usefulness of bibliographical analysis, it may also help us understand better both the books and their authors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The connection between the two books has been noted repeatedly. Bowers himself assumes his audience's familiarity with the earlier work and in his Foreword says that he will not touch on various materials “readily available in McKerrow's classic” (ix). Readers with access to the original dust jacket of Principles would find the connection reiterated. According to the flaps, “ Principles of Bibliographical Description is intended to supplement and act as a companion piece to McKerrow's well-known Introduction to Bibliography; it covers a subject only briefly treated by McKerrow.” In reviewing Principles, F. C. Francis determined that “Professor Bowers's book should take its place beside McKerrow on every bibliographer's bookshelf,” and Curt Bühler envisioned similar cohabitation: “Bowers has done for technical description what McKerrow did for bibliographical investigation, and the `Principles of Bibliographical Description' will henceforth hold an honored place alongside `An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students.'” In an account that indirectly pays tribute to McKerrow's lucidity and Bowers's thoroughness, Donald Wing opened his review with a slightly different characterization of the relationship between the books: “Let it be said at the outset that this beautifully printed volume of five hundred pages is not a substitute for McKerrow's classic Introduction to Bibliography. That remains the undergraduate approach to the material. Mr. Bowers has gone on to a graduate seminar where only the initiate can fully follow.” 1 Given the care that had gone into the preparation of these books, one would anticipate little need for post-publication revision. Each book had received the scrutiny and advice of many consultants, including the greatest bibliographers of the day. McKerrow acknowledged his friends W. W. Greg and A. W. Pollard as having pride of place for assistance, including for reading the entire book in manuscript or proof (vii). In a similar vein, Bowers pointed out “my paramount indebtedness to Dr. W. W. Greg's searching criticisms of a large part of the manuscript” (x-xi), and he dedicated the book to Greg. Bowers also had had the advantage of seeing the 1947 Rosenbach Lectures—by Bühler, James McManaway, and Lawrence Wroth 2 — before they were published (as Standards of Bibliographical Description, in the same year as Principles ). Both Bühler and McManaway, meanwhile, acknowledged having had access to Bowers's manuscript earlier, while preparing their own. Their familiarity with Principles and Bowers's acquaintance with their reactions to it enabled him to answer their replies before their responses were actually in print. This he did throughout Principles, but specifically in Appendix III, where he addressed Bühler's concerns. Nonetheless, readers who have imbibed the lessons of McKerrow and Bowers may be dubious that these books attained either their desired or their final forms on first publication. Suspicions might be reinforced by recollection of alterations in other well-known bibliographical works. Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography was first published by Oxford University Press in 1972 but then reprinted with corrections in England in 1974 and in the United States in 1975—the latter in two different “second printings.” 3 G. Thomas Tanselle and David McKitterick have identified passages in some of Greg's best-known articles that changed between their original appearance and publication in his Collected Papers, and Tanselle has also observed how Bowers added footnotes (but marked them as newly inserted) when his essays were reprinted. 4 Circumstances directly related to the McKerrow and Bowers books likewise encourage wariness in assuming that they attained their ultimate form on their first appearance. In a publication announcement for Principles, Princeton University Press acknowledged the challenge of getting the text right (and thereby called attention to the possibility that the challenge might not have been met adequately): it noted “the mechanical job of composition involving special type and other unusual problems.” 5 In reviewing the Introduction, George P. Winship noted McKerrow's willingness to modify what he had written earlier: “the quality in Mr. McKerrow's work which most surely inspires confidence,” wrote Winship, “is the matter-of-fact way in which he goes about demonstrating the mistakes in his own earlier Notes. ” 6 The earlier article Winship speaks of is McKerrow's “Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors of English Works of the Six- teenth and Seventeenth Centuries,” written in the autumn of 1913 and published in 1914. 7 McKerrow is indeed forthright about changes he makes for the book: he acknowledges and corrects, for instance, “a bad blunder which I made in the original edition of these notes” (p. 40, n. 3). Fine tuning after original publication is in fact a frequent characteristic of McKerrow's scholarship as well as of the treatment of his work by others. The “Notes” themselves acquired slight refinements between their periodical appearance and their issue as a separate. (Among the variants, the only clearly preferable reading occurs in the separate, suggesting that—for this instance at least—the separate contains the later state. 8 ) McKerrow's first book, Eigo Hatsuongaku, was revised the year after its original publication in 1902. 9 The 1905 printing of The Gull's Hornbook, which he edited, identified itself as “in the main [only], a reprint of that issued last year”; and a cancel leaf was required for his 1907 edition of The History of Orlando Furioso 1594 to correct the spelling of his name (first given as “Robert”) in Greg's note on the back of the title page. When his five-volume edition of Thomas Nashe (1904-10) was reprinted “with corrections and supplementary notes” in 1958, the new editor, F. P. Wilson, noted that McKerrow himself had “printed corrections to his text on p. 484 of volume iv and p. 373 of volume v” and that “McKerrow also added explanatory notes as his edition was passing through the press” (5.373). Even the list by F. C. Francis that records most of these changes includes “revisions by the [new] compiler” when the record is reprinted with a collection of McKerrow's writings. 10 Opportunities for intentional and inadvertent changes in Introduction and Principles multiplied as the books were reprinted. The accompanying chart lists the impressions that I have identified—fourteen of McKerrow and ten of Bowers. The printings are numbered consecutively at the left of each column; superscripts indicate the sequence within a family of printings, or within what Bowers calls a “subsidiary edition” or “sub-edition.” 11 The pattern of these reimpressions reiterates the link between the two books that was noted immediately when Principles first appeared: reflecting but also propelling trends in scholarship, these books often have come forth in tandem over the past half century. Printings of McKerrow's Introduction and Bowers's Principles McKerrow, Introduction Bowers, Principles 1 Oxford1, 1927 2 Oxford2, 1928 3 Oxford3, 1948 4 Oxford4, 1949 1 Princeton1, 1949 5 Oxford5, 1951 6 Oxford6, 1959 7 Oxford7, 1960 8 Oxford8, 1962 2 Russell &amp; Russell1, 1962 9 Oxford9, 1964 3 Russell &amp; Russell2, 1963-64? 10 Oxford10, 1965 4 Russell &amp; Russell3, 1965-71? 11 Oxford11, 1967 12 Oxford12, 1972 5 Russell &amp; Russell4, 1972-75? 13 Oxford13, 1977 6 Russell &amp; Russell5, 1977 7 St Paul's1, 1986 8 St Paul's2, 1987 14 St Paul's1/Oak Knoll, 1994 9 St Paul's3/Oak Knoll, 1994 10 St Paul's4/Oak Knoll, 1998 The publishing history of these two works has not always been clear even to those who have written about them. An article surveying the career of McKerrow half a century after the appearance of Introduction mentions only the uncorrected 1927 impression in its checklist of his works; the latest edition of a renowned guide to literary terms gives only the date of the tenth printing of McKerrow's “classic work on bookmaking and printing,” citing the book as “rev. 1965”; and the publishers of the recent tenth printing of Bowers's Principles identify it as the fifth. 12 After the corrected impression of McKerrow's Introduction in 1928, that book was not reprinted again until two decades later—almost as if nudged back into public view by the appearance of Bowers's Principles (which was distributed in England by the Introduction 's publisher, Oxford 13 ). The Bowers book was listed by Books in Print (but identified there as Principles of Bibliographical Criticism ) as “in press” in 1948 and 1949, and it was published on 30 December 1949. 14 In the same era (from 1948 to 1951), Introduction underwent three printings. The heyday of both books spanned the 1960s. From 1959 through 1972, Oxford University Press reprinted McKerrow seven times. When Oxford redesigned the jacket in 1959, Principles appeared on the back panel atop a newly added list of “ Some OXFORD Books ”, where it remained for the printings of 1960 and 1962 as well. Principles therefore seems to have been available in England as late as 1962, but in 1960 it dropped from the American Books in Print. As if now spurred by the popularity of McKerrow, the scholarly reprint firm Russell and Russell reprinted the Bowers book in New York four times in this period, beginning in 1962. Russell and Russell produced a fifth impression shortly thereafter—in the same year (1977) that Oxford released a thirteenth printing of Introduction. The Bowers book reappeared as a new subedition in printings from St Paul's Bibliographies in 1986 and 1987, but McKerrow's Introduction was not further reprinted (perhaps because it was incorrectly perceived to be superseded by Gaskell's New Introduction to Bibliography of 1972) until it and Principles were published as companion volumes by St Paul's and Oak Knoll Press in 1994. Principles was reprinted as part of this subedition in 1998, the same year that a Spanish translation of McKerrow's Introduction appeared. 15 The renewed interest in Principles reflected in the printings of the late 1980s and the 1990s was meanwhile mirrored by a 1991 Japanese book, Akira Takano's Yōsho no hanashi (“A Story of European Books”). It was “Based on Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description, ” 16 but by also drawing on McKerrow (directly adopting, for instance, his illustrations of pairs of leaves from pp. 167 and 169, which now appeared on pp. 19 and 21), it reemphasized the natural connection between the two works. The exact dates of the five known Russell and Russell printings are hard to pin down, but details from the title and copyright pages provide useful clues. The two impressions that seem the earliest are those that have the publisher's city and name in separate lines on the title page and that print the copyright information, including the statement “Reissued, 1962,” at the top of the next page. In the other three impressions the imprint information appears in a single line and the copyright details move to the foot of the page, where they read largely the same except that Russell and Russell is then called “A Division of Atheneum Publishers, Inc.” Atheneum acquired Russell and Russell in 1965; 17 the copies without the ownership declaration therefore seem to have come before that, an inference supported by the fact that one of them has the date 1962 on the title page. This printing is in fact the only one in the subedition to have a date in the imprint, and it generates the surmise that, as the sole impression that can be linked indisputably with the year of the first reprint, it might indeed be that first reprint. Unless hitherto unrecognized printings exist, the other impression without the reference to Atheneum—and hence also implicitly published before 1965— would have been the second printing. At the other end of the series, the latest Russell and Russell printing is almost certainly the one bound in brown cloth (instead of the blue cloth with which the others are covered). Its copyright page again says “Reissued, 1962” but adds “Copyright renewed, 1977, by Princeton University Press”; it presumably appeared in 1977 or shortly thereafter. (I purchased my copy of this printing in November 1979.) What then must be the intermediate printings of the subedition, the third and fourth of those that have been identified (both of them bound in blue, both with the copyright information at the foot of the page), can be distinguished by whether or not they include an ISBN number on the copyright page. That system for identifying books was approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1970, 18 and in 1973 Russell and Russell first added the number to its entry for Principles in Books in Print. My copy of the printing without an ISBN designation is signed and dated “1971” by a previous owner; the lack of other marks of ownership or of use may be signs that he bought it new that year. The printing with the ISBN code, on the other hand, was available in December 1975, when Terry Belanger purchased a copy for the Book Arts Press. Those benchmarks make it plausible that the third printing of this subedition appeared between 1965 (the year Atheneum acquired Russell and Russell) and 1971, and the fourth during the years from 1972 through 1975. 19 A full bibliographical analysis of these books would be interesting and productive, as even a cursory inspection suggests. For example, the volumes and dust jackets of McKerrow's Introduction offer a case study in the design and production methods of the Oxford University Press over half a century, and through their changing list of cities in which the Press had an office they even suggest the course of world events. The book in which McKerrow offers the general rule that “the handsomest edition of a book is the first” and in which he points out that the “tendency of reprints has at all times been toward the saving of expense in production” (p. 184) provides its own evidence for his observations as it gradually abandons paper with chain lines, removes the second color from its jacket, and reduces its height. The latter change—one that underscores McKerrow's point about the benefits that arise from “the comparison of several copies” (p. 230)—occurs during the binding of the fifth printing: the large copies (9″ high) have only their top edge trimmed, whereas the shorter (8⅝″) and presumably later ones, with a higher publisher's price, are smooth on all edges. The original size is partially restored beginning with the tenth printing, though the subsequent volumes never fully regain the height of the early ones. The pattern of dress is similar for Bowers's Principles, whose colored title-page cartouche becomes black in all reprintings and whose original dust jacket diminishes to brown wrapping paper on the Russell and Russell impressions. 20 (Currently both books are sold only in paper covers.) The overall consistency of these patterns makes variations from them suggestive; that the second Russell and Russell printing of Principles has the thickest paper and finest-grained cloth of the subedition, for example, may hint that this impression rather than the one with the title-page date is the true first printing. The Bowers and McKerrow books also provide other fascinations to the bibliographical eye. It is interesting, for instance, to ponder the industrial procedures that resulted in alternating paper stocks in the 1986 Principles, or to watch the Oxford printers address the problem of how best to impose a book whose leaves in some impositions did not add up to full regular gatherings (the Oxford impressions of McKerrow have been variously gathered in fours, eights, and twelves). The selective but extensive examination that follows is not intended as a full printing or publishing history; rather, it focuses on a particular physical feature of these books, their texts, in an attempt to answer some basic questions about changes that occurred. 21 Curiosity compels identification of McKerrow's unspecified corrections and additions, and a similar inquisitiveness prompts investigation of whether the printings of Principles that imply similarity with each other really do have the same texts. The incentive for these questions is practical as well: readers need to know whether some forms of the book should be consulted instead of others—and, indeed, whether certain ones should be used as the basis for reprints. Knowing what has been modified also helps in the actual reading of these books. The existence and nature of changes first of all provide assistance in understanding the relative care these authors exercised at various stages (and thereby contribute to assessing their overall credibility). The alterations may also reveal the development of the authors' thought, and those determined to be authorial also signal for the reader elements that likely reflect specially considered judgments. By reiterating to readers the possibility that a text may exist in different forms, this kind of analysis also provides a more general lesson in reading, for it reminds those who come to texts that the need to test all things includes the necessity of assessing critically even the typographical symbols that they have in front of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The most significant changes that appeared in either book occurred in the second printing of Introduction. The “few corrections and small addi- tions ” that McKerrow speaks of in his “Note to the Second Impression” (dated June 1928) do not approach in density or degree the ones introduced when a section of the book was reprinted in an anthology of typographic writings some years after his death, 22 but in the range of situations that call them forth they quietly exemplify major lessons taught in the book itself. The alterations are in matters of fact, grammar, and orthography, and occasionally in literary style and typographical design as well. Some are likely to have resulted from McKerrow's own contemplation, recognition of errors, and discovery of new information; others may have come from Oxford's printers and editors; and a number appear in response to the observations of reviewers. 23 With one exception (the repair of type damage), I have not found intentional amendments of the text after the second printing, though a number of accidental deteriorations do occur. The largest and most important group of modifications consists of adjustments to make the information more accurate or precise, either by correcting errors or by providing new facts. In order to focus on this category, it is helpful to deal first with the smaller groups of changes, beginning with those that were not for the better. Several of them occur already in the second impression, which overall is printed from the same setting as the first. A comma vanishes at the end of the first line of note 3 on page 224, and two page numbers undergo alteration: “xi” drops from the preliminaries, and “113” is reset. For “113” the compositor happens to replace the second digit with the letter “r”, a character that remains in all subsequent printings. Throughout those later lithographic reprints, in turn, various changes result from degeneration of the type images. The barely detectable period that concludes the caption on page 149 in the second impression becomes invisible in the third; starting with the third printing, the closing period is absent after the final note on page 310; the letters “os” of “imposition” at 263.7 are missing in the sixth through twelfth printings and in the fourteenth; and beginning with the eighth printing the full stop that is presented as an example at the start of the fourth paragraph on page 316 is gone. The book also provides a rare example of type damage that seems intended. On page 145, the job number “3349” in the new direction line of the third printing is corrected to “3249” in the fourth (continuing through the twelfth), apparently by removing the lower portion of the second digit. One other instance of the later reading being the inferior one—an example that incidentally serves as a reminder that graphic images are subject to the same vicissitudes as words and punctuation—occurs in Figure 9, on page 35. Two separate but related changes occur in the octavo imposition diagrams here: the inner forme is moved from the bottom to the top of the page, and it is rotated 180°. Whether both modifications were intended or whether one happened accidentally in the course of the other is unclear; either way, they may illustrate varieties of what McKerrow sees as a common problem, the “transformation of sense by the attempt to correct mistakes” (p. 198). The switching of the formes is puzzling, for in his other illustrations McKerrow consistently presents the outer forme first (he depicts the folio on pages 30 and 33, the quarto on 16-17, and the duodecimo on 170-171). Perhaps the exchange is an unintended consequence of revision, though it is not an alteration that obscures sense. The rotation, however, presents difficulties, and there are grounds for thinking that McKerrow himself is responsible. Both the Introduction and the earlier “Notes” provide some suggestion that McKerrow does not have a firm grasp of the intricacies of imposition and that although his understanding develops it is not yet complete by the time of the book's publication. He increases the difficulty of comprehending these matters, moreover, by rendering the imposition patterns as pages of type lying on the bed of the press rather than as their images printed on a sheet. He recognizes the problem, for amid his repeated injunctions to read- SB 52, Page 226 SB 52, Page 227 ers that the easiest way to understand these layouts is to take up and fold sheets of paper he reiterates that those aids to learning will be “looking-glass” images of his diagrams (as on pp. 18 and [beginning with the second printing] 37). 24 Problems with imposition are first evident in the 1914 article. The folio (pp. 245-246) is portrayed properly, but the layout of the quarto (pp. 228-229) works only if the sheet is turned incorrectly—that is, pivoted on its long edge for the printing of the second forme. The octavo (p. 247) is again all right, with the sheet being turned on its short edge for the iteration. All three of these patterns—two correct, one incorrect—are repeated in the first printing of Introduction (with the diagram for the quarto matching the incorrect verbal description on page 18). The treatment of the duodecimo, however, undergoes changes from the article to the book and reflects development in McKerrow's understanding. In the “Notes” he points out that because “there are several ways in which the pages can be imposed” for small “sizes” such as duodecimo, and because these “sizes are seldom of any practical importance to those who are likely to read these pages,” therefore “It must... suffice here to give a single scheme for 12mo imposition, and to leave readers to work out others for themselves, if they wish to do so” (pp. 248-249). The imposition scheme he chooses to illustrate, duodecimo without cutting, was, to say the least, uncommon; according to Gaskell, “There seems to be no clear evidence” that it “was ever used in the hand-press period” ( New Introduction, p. 107). By the time of the Introduction McKerrow's understanding and experience have progressed: though he again presents a diagram for folding without cutting (p. 171), he also includes one showing the more familiar pattern of “twelve-mo by cutting,” saying that “So far as my observation extends, this was the normal, and practically the only, method of producing a 12mo used by English printers of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries” (p. 170). McKerrow himself documents what happened between 1914 and 1927. In discussion after a Bibliographical Society talk by R. W. Chapman on 15 October 1923 that was itself a response to some points made in McKerrow's article, McKerrow acknowledges that “In these notes, being conscious that I did not know much about duodecimos but feeling it necessary to say something about them, I worked out the possible ways of folding a sheet in twelve and left it at that.” The “examination of a fair number of duodecimos since I compiled those notes,” he continues, “has led me to the belief that, round about the year 1600 at any rate, the method of cutting off the lower third of the sheet which Mr. Chapman has found practised in the eighteenth century was, if not the only method, at least the usual one.” 25 In the 1927 revamping of the material on duodecimos McKerrow also makes one other significant change: for the first time he presents imposition diagrams based on “the printed sheet (not the form of type)” (p. 170). McKerrow's uneasiness with some questions of bibliographical format was noted by at least one reviewer of the book. According to the TLS writer, “Dr. McKerrow illustrates these mysteries of imposition by diagrams, and, though with a momentary lack of courage he remarks `into the question of 24mo. I cannot enter,' he returns to the charge in an appendix.” McKerrow likewise falters on a related matter, the role of the pins or points that hold the sheet on the tympan during printing. His description on pages 22-23 is largely unchanged from the account on page 266 of the “Notes.” In it he fails to acknowledge a crucial feature of their positioning—that, to help the pressmen pivot the sheet in the right direction, they were placed asymmetrically, so that the holes they created would match only for a certain turning of the sheet. A passage he adds in the second printing of the book (p. 37) speaks to the turning of the sheet and does at least indicate his struggle with the complexities involved: Note IV. If this point be overlooked, strange errors will result. In working out imposition schemes by means of folded paper it is essential to remember always that the arrangement of pages in the printed sheet is a `looking-glass image' of the arrangement of the type-pages in the forme itself (i.e. reversed from left to right or from top to bottom). But the account of imposition remains incomplete, for this elaboration does not recognize that the different turnings produce different effects, nor does it specify when each is appropriate. The uncertainty that characterizes McKerrow's dealing with format culminates in the change of the diagram for the inner forme in Figure 9. What was correct in the “Notes” and in the first printing of Introduction goes awry as the pattern is rearranged to show the sheet being turned across its long side instead of its short one. In various ways McKerrow warns his readers of the “strange muddle” caused when “sheets, after being printed on one side,” are “turned the wrong way round when being perfected” (p. 260; this wording also appears in “Notes,” p. 250). Though through his efforts McKerrow may save others from misunderstanding, on this point he does not save himself. But most of the alterations in the second printing are appropriate. These involve first of all making consistent a number of typographical details, ones whose variability offers support to McKerrow's observation that “The human body is not a perfect machine” (p. 225). On the final page of the table of contents (xi, line 11), the concluding points are removed from “12mo.” and “24mo.” in order to match the text itself. 26 (This is the page on which the pagination also disappears—perhaps accidentally in the course of deleting the points.) Excessive letter spacing is reduced between the first “i” and the “f” of “Bassifie” in the inset quotation on 242 and within “i.e.” in the note on 311. On page 340, short equals signs are replaced by ones matching the others in the list of Latin place-names (in the entries for Pisae, Regiomontium, Salmantica, Senae, Spira, and Venetiae). This attention to typographical nuance finds its most surprising manifestation in two instances where passages have been reset simply for visual effect. In the first printing, the first line of the second full paragraph on page 57 has large gaps between words. To balance its appearance with the following line, a syllable from that one is moved up: “been| described” becomes “been de-|scribed”. In the second full paragraph on 94, lines 3 through 6 all start with a three-letter word, creating a river of white space to their right (three lines in a row begin with the word “the”), and line 3 also is set unusually loose. The revision moves a word from line 4 to line 3: the lineation changes from “below| the title” to “below the| title”, thereby addressing both problems. In a slightly different instance, where space instead is added, the structure of a page's content is clarified when the list of Latin abbreviations on page 324 is lowered to set it off typographically from the preceding prose. The nature of some of the details needing correction makes it hard to tell whether they originated from the compositor's slips or from the faithful reproduction of the author's errors (which in turn might have resulted from momentary inattention or faulty understanding). Reviewers of the first printing pointed out how “proving” at 14.16 should be “proofing” (Byles, Modern Language Review ) and, at 341.12-13, “ Facsimilies ” ought to be “ Facsimiles ” (Sisson, Library ); both are corrected in 1928. At 161.9, the name “Moretius” becomes “Morelius”. To mark the beginning of a parenthetical statement, a comma is added after the first word of the note on 70, and a colon replaces a period at the close of the introduction to the inset quotation on 122. McKerrow also uses the occasion of a second printing to make a number of stylistic changes. He converts the preposition in the phrase “puffing titles found on many Elizabethan books” to “in” (93.11), and to reduce repetition of forms of the word cause that appear three times in four lines he alters “which cause his work to fall below” to “which result in his work falling below” (240.8). Some verbal changes that might be considered stylistic are in fact necessary for the sense. In his Library review Charles Sisson pointed out that the phrase “may prevent the reproduction from falling short of our reasonable expectation” at the end of the opening paragraph on 239 made no sense; McKerrow changes the core of it to “from coming up to our”. Elsewhere a revision is necessary because the original syntax is incoherent. The opening of the note on 33 first reads: It is important to observe that the repetition of borders or ornaments outside the text-page proves nothing, for these would, I think, normally be added at the time of imposition, or to illustrations which in certain cases (e.g. necessary diagrams in astronomical books, &amp;c.) might possibly be so added, Struggling to bend the sentence to sense using words that would occupy the same amount of space, he at least produces a pair of prepositional phrases, however awkwardly they match: It is important to observe that the repetition of borders... imposition; or of certain kinds of illustrations (e.g.... &amp;c.), which might.... By far the largest category of textual changes for the second printing, however, comprises corrections and additions in the name of accuracy, bibliographical and otherwise. The reasons for certain kinds of modifications in the reprintings are obvious: the date on the title page must change, the information on the copyright page needs to be updated, or the colophon at the end of the book must report a new printer. Those alterations and ones in direction lines are not reported in the list that follows, which unless otherwise indicated cites changes between the first and second printings and assumes that all subsequent impressions follow the second. The adjustments in the preliminaries that were caused by introduction of the McKitterick essay in the St Paul's/Oak Knoll printing likewise are not included here. But all the other changes I have identified but have not yet mentioned are present. Each account begins with the page number on which the variation occurs, and it generally includes some explanation of why the text was altered. viii. At the end of the Preface, the 1928 printing adds a note retained in all subsequent impressions: NOTE TO THE SECOND IMPRESSION| A reprint being required, I have taken the opportunity to make a few corrections and small additions.| R. B. McK.| June, 1928. xv. To the list of useful books McKerrow adds an entry after line 26 for one by his friend A. W. Pollard in order to account for a new reference in the note on 265: “— Fine Books. London, 1912.” 1. The opening word of chapter one is altered from “THIRTEEN” to “FOURTEEN”. Because McKerrow is speaking of the number of years since “I put together the `Notes on Bibliographical Evidence'” (“In the autumn of 1913,” according to a parallel sentence that begins the Preface) rather than the years since the article was actually published (in 1914), this change may be the correction of a misstatement rather than a recalculation based on the date of the revision, a year after the 1927 first printing. 34. The addition of “ Note IV. ” (quoted above) at the foot of 37 requires on 34 the insertion of a cross-referential footnote and the incorporation of a corresponding superscript “2” in the text seven lines from the bottom. The new note, six lines long, emphasizes that the arrangement of pages on the printed sheet is “a `looking-glass image' of the arrangement of type-pages in the forme itself.” The new footnote, inserted at the end of a short existing line of type, reads simply: “2See Note IV on page 37.” 38. Lines 2 through 5 of the second paragraph are reset for greater precision in dating (and better congruence with the date “1530” in the caption on the following page): the phrase “Badius's later block in 1520 (figure 10)” changes to “his later blocks in 1520 and c. 1529 (figure 10)”. In the next sentence, the dependent pronoun switches from “this” to “these”. 39. The following two-line footnote is appended to the caption of Figure 10: 1 The press is wrongly drawn with a left-handed screw, which would cause the platen to rise when the bar was pulled. To gain room for the new note, the final two lines of the opening paragraph on the previous page (38) are compressed into one (by dropping the word “also” after “apparently” and by tightening the spacing), thereby providing space for the top line of 39 to be moved to 38. The new note becomes the first one on 39, resulting in the change of the superscript of the page's previously solitary note both as it appears in the text (in the line immediately below the caption) and in the note itself. Stephen Tabor's account of McKerrow in the Dictionary of Literary Biography includes a reproduction (on p. 206) of the first state of page 39. (The on-line form of the article does not include any of its illustrations. 27 ) 72. In lines 18 and 19, McKerrow corrects information about the history of stereotyping, working the alteration into the existing space. In a change perhaps encouraged by someone's attentiveness to a local slight, “reinvented at Edinburgh in 1781, only to| be again abandoned” becomes “reinvented by A. Tilloch of Glasgow in 1781,| but again abandoned”. 74. The fourth and third lines from the bottom soften an earlier speculation, again adjusting the new wording to fit the available space: “was difficult, if not| impossible, for them” becomes “was naturally very| troublesome for them”. 80. McKerrow adjusts note 2 (which concludes on the following page) about the nineteenth-century American practice of signing plates for multiple imposition patterns. Though he does not fully understand the phenomenon, which lies outside the period of his greatest attention, he nonetheless provides useful evidence—and, in the revision, adds to it. The relevant part of the last three lines of the note on 80 and top five lines on 81 originally reads: most curiously signed books in the Furness Variorum edition of Hamlet, the first volume of which (at least in the `Fifth Edition') has two sets of [p. 81] signatures throughout, being signed by numbers in sixes, and by letters in eights ! It is sewn in eights. I presume that this peculiarity is due to a variation in the make-up of the volume when reprinting from plates, the signatures The revised portions are as follows: most curious systems of signature in the Furness Variorum Shakespeare, some volumes of which, e.g. Romeo and Juliet, 1871, and vol. i of Hamlet, 1877 (and [p. 81] later eds.), have two sets... in eights ! They are sewn... make-up of the volumes after the casting of plates, the signatures 93. Charles Sisson's identification in his Library review of earlier instances of advertisements citing authors as the writers of previous works prompts McKerrow to come up with examples still a century earlier. The revised footnote in which he incorporates them is two lines longer than the original one, requiring condensed setting of other passages on the page. The new information also entails slight revision of the text, albeit in situations that require the rewording to occupy the same amount of space as the first version. The initial change, a recasting of the opening two lines of the second full paragraph on the page, proceeds as follows: Towards the end of the eighteenth century, however,| a new form of advertisement appears on the title-page, In the later eighteenth century, however, a new form| of advertisement becomes frequent on the title-page, A slight modification within lines 6 and 7 of the same paragraph deflects blame for the shortcoming away from Michael Sadleir, on whose helpful survey of his own collection McKerrow based his original remark: the earliest instance of this known| to him is in 1791 when the School for Widows is becomes the earliest instance of this in the| collection is in the School for Widows, 1791, which is Two passages are truncated in order to reduce the text by a line each time. The concluding lines of the second paragraph change as follows: It need hardly be said that the practice, once intro-| duced, has continued. The practice has, of course, continued. The end of the final full paragraph on the page is likewise altered: may be surrounded by a border of| ornamental pieces. may have a border of ornaments. The most important change occurs in the footnote. The early form reads: 1 It may be supposed that the practice originated with anonymous works which were described simply as `By the Author of' so and so (an earlier work equally anonymous). McKerrow's new investigations result in this version: 1 Scattered examples of this practice are found much earlier, e.g. in Bunyan's Holy War, 1682, R. Head's Nugae Venales, 1686, Wither's Divine Poems, 1688, and cf. Arber's Term Cat. i. 22, 39, 95, 122, 141, &amp;c. &amp;c., but it did not, I think, become usual until the period mentioned. 99. The addition of the two-line note 6 citing a 1906 article on the paper-maker John Spilman requires condensation of other passages in order to gain sufficient space on the page. The note reads: “6For a detailed account of Spilman, see G. H. Overend in Proc. of Huguenot Soc. of London, viii.180-96.” The new information also results in two corrections: of the spelling of Spilman's name (from “Spillman”) two lines from the bottom of the text (a superscript for the new note is also added here), and, two lines above that, of the date he was granted a license (from “1588” to “1588/9”). Verbal alterations and tighter word spacing twice effect the saving of a line of type: in note 3, “by an evident slip” is reduced to “by a slip”, and in note 5 “large quantities| of English rags” is cut down to “English rags”. 102. A newly available article, dated the same month as McKerrow's prefatory note to his second impression, prompts McKerrow to revise his estimate of the futility of studying the location of watermarks on the sheet. His duties as co-secretary (with A. W. Pollard) of the Bibliographical Society, which included “supervision of publications,” presumably would have acquainted him with the article before it was published. 28 The original and revised passages, which appear at the end of the first full paragraph on the page and involve four lines, read as follows: has never been investigated, and unfortunately, though it would be useful to have the results, they would hardly be worth the great amount of research which would be necessary in order to arrive at them. has not yet been fully investigated, though an excellent beginning has been made by Mr. Edward Heawood in a paper on `The Position on the Sheet of Early Watermarks' printed in The Library, 4th Series, ix. 38-47 (June, 1928). Heawood's Library article, which begins “In his recently published `Introduction to Bibliography,'” takes as its occasion the 1927 appearance of McKerrow's book. In the course of discussing the position of watermarks in sheets of paper, Heawood also addresses another question McKerrow raises: whether early paper was ever made in sheets double the normal size. 131. The TLS review called attention to a 1909 article that McKerrow should have been aware of. He introduces the reference in the second printing by altering lines 2 through 4 of the first new paragraph on this page; the change results in the resetting of the subsequent twelve lines as well. The two forms of the passage are as follows: editions, and indeed so far as I have been able to ascertain there is no evidence as to the number of copies of any book printed in England until after 1550. editions, but of certain books printed by Pynson in 1493-4 the edition consisted of 600 copies, and of one, apparently, of 1,000 (cf. H. R. Plomer in The Library, 2nd Ser., x. 115-30). 206. The addition of a footnote on 218 citing a recent article by Percy Simpson requires shifting of the text on that page as well as inclusion of a three-line cross-reference at the end of the note on 206 (which begins on 205) and the subsequent adjustment of text in that area. This new material on 206 reads: “Cf. also the important article by Mr. Percy Simpson on `Proofreading by English Authors of the 16th and 17th Centuries' referred to on p. 218 note 1.” To gain the needed space, first the text of note 3 on 205 is squeezed from three lines into two by reducing the opening indentation of each of the three footnotes on 205 from 3.2 to 2.4 mm. (The single-line note 1 and the first line of note 3 are consequently reset, though they read the same.) One line of note 3 is then moved from 206 to 205, and the spacing above and below the quotation immediately above the footnote on 206 is reduced. 218. Information promised in the added note on 206 is provided as a new three-line note 1 on 218 (with a footnote superscript for it inserted at the end of the second full paragraph). That results first of all in the renumbering and repositioning of the single existing note on 218, which now becomes note 2 (with the superscript in the text changing accordingly). To provide the space required for the addition, the four lines at the end of the first paragraph on 217 are reset as three; the top line of 218 is moved to 217; the bottom line of 218 is moved to 219; and the final two lines of the paragraph concluding at the top of 219 are compacted into one. Perhaps to dilute the typographical impact of the insertion over several pages, the title of the article is given only in the new note on 206 and information about the journal in which it appeared only here: “1But see the article by Mr. Percy Simpson in Oxford Bibl. Soc. Proceedings, II. i (1928), pp. 5-14, for some important additions to this list.” 265. In the footnote which begins on 264, McKerrow reduces what amounts to a blurb for a British Museum exhibition catalog in order to mention a source he overlooked earlier, A. W. Pollard's Fine Books (1912). (This is the title McKerrow also added to the list on p. xv.) The original passage (from the end of line 8 through line 12 on 265) and the portions that are new are as follows: indicated. As, moreover, the book is illustrated by facsimiles from the more important works, it can be strongly recommended as giving a good general introduction to the subject at an extremely low price. There is, I think, no recent general history of printing, but the aesthetic side is dealt with in Mr. Stanley Morison's indicated. There are facsimiles from the more important works. There is... dealt with in Prof. A. W. Pollard's Fine Books, 1912, which contains an excellent general account of the early development of printing and many facsimiles, and in Mr. Stanley Morison's 297. Six lines from the bottom of the text, “black letter” is hyphenated in the second, third, and fourth printings. The hyphen may be obscured by accident in the fifth and subsequent printings, but the intentional intervention revealed by the word “black” simultaneously moving slightly left in this lithographic printing suggests that the hyphen was removed by design. On this and the following page, the phrase “black letter” (with and without a hyphen) appears nine times. All four occasions in which the words function as adjective and noun respectively appropriately lack the hyphen; of the four instances other than the current one where they function as a single adjective modifying another noun, three have a hyphen and one (the closest, seven lines later) does not. The present example therefore is inconsistent whether or not it includes the requisite hyphen. 319. McKerrow adds a footnote (and, after “practice” in line 2 of the second paragraph, a superscript “3”) that provides references to the use of contractions in manuscripts, the objects that lie behind the early printed books that are his chief concern: 3 For the principles governing the MS. practice cf. Madan, Books in Manuscript, 1920, pp. 33-9 and Mediaeval England, ed. H. W. C. Davis, 1924, pp. 466- 8. To provide room for the three-line note, the printer reduces the space between the text and the first footnote, and McKerrow rephrases the end of the second paragraph to save one line of print, as follows: though he must not| expect to find the usage in printed books, which is| indeed far from uniform, correspond exactly with that| of the MSS. though the usage| in printed books, which is indeed far from uniform,| does not correspond exactly with that of the MSS. 324. The list of Latin abbreviations and contractions adds one entry and modifies three others, all in the first of the two columns. To accommodate the change, the final item in the longer first column is moved to the top of the second, thereby also equalizing their length. As noted earlier, the entire list is lowered slightly on the page to differentiate it more clearly from the introductory text. The new entry in this alphabetical roster occurs at the beginning of “g”: “g [with an overring] = ergo”. (Unlike in the other entries, “ergo” is not followed by a stop.) McKerrow also revises the abbreviations used for “apostolice,” “apostolorum,” and “igitur.” 353. In the second column of this index page McKerrow adds an entry recommended by Sisson in his Library review: “forel (a kind of parchment), 123”. He does not, however, incorporate the one for “measure” that Sisson also wanted. To accommodate “forel” the printer has reduced the white space between the entries beginning with “e” and “f”. 355. In the entry for “kern” in the first column of this index page, McKerrow corrects the page reference “318.” to “313.”, as Sisson advised in the Library review. Sisson also hoped, unsuccessfully, that McKerrow would define the term earlier in the book than he does.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The text of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description likewise changes over its lifetime. The modifications are significantly fewer than in McKerrow, though in one respect they are also more surprising (at least to those who have not been paying attention to the message of McKerrow and Bowers), for they are unannounced. I know of two occasions on which alterations in the book have been recognized. In his article “Textual Variation in Bowers's Principles: A Short Note” in the Swedish journal Text: Svensk Tidskrift för Bibliografi (5.2 [Feb. 1998], 118-119), Rolf E. Du Rietz identifies what prove to be the two most extensive amendments of the text, on pages 20 and 94; his hope that “the clue” he provides “will be followed up” has served as the immediate stimulus for the present exercise. Meanwhile, for several years Terry Belanger at the University of Virginia has distributed to his Rare Book School class in descriptive bibliography a sheet illustrating a variant passage on page 202 as it appears in four printings. I have identified only one occurrence of a change for the worse, the result of accidental type damage. The other alterations all are improvements, designed to correct the work of either the printer or the author. Not all lapses in the original printing are rectified, however, including at least one that a reviewer spotted. The TLS pointed out that the middle initial in the name “Mr. A. E. Esdaile” (apparently the reference in note 27 on page 30) was wrong. It stays that way. (Arundell J. K. Esdaile himself did not call attention to the transgression in his own review of the book.) In another instance, the page from the heart of Principles chosen to illustrate Myers's 1979 article in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review (where Bowers's page 216 is pictured on page 363 of the journal) happens to be the one that in all printings lacks a superscript in the collation formula at the top. 29 Such anomalies, in the book but also in reviews, sometimes prove useful in suggesting aspects of the pre-publication history of the work. Bowers's sample description of Washington Irving's Wolfert's Roost (pp. 480-484) first appeared as a mimeographed handout to accompany his talk “Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Description of Modern Authors” at the inaugural meeting of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia on 26 February 1947. The published version differs in several ways (including in the elimination of a format designation at the start of the collation formula), but the most curious change is the addition of the phrase “ stet 12 PARK” after the title-page transcription. (It also appears, in the same position, in an abbreviated “basic form” of the description that Bowers adds in the book version.) Although the title-page imprint itself contains the address `12 PARK PLACE', later paragraphs of the description report that pub- lisher's advertisements incorporated at the end of the volume are headed `10 P PARK P LACE ' and that the third through sixth impressions have the street number 10 instead of 12 on the title page. What seems to have happened is that a copy-editor of Principles regularized the street numbers and possibly the typography of the street name, that Bowers or someone else corrected that mistake by writing “ stet ” and the original form of the address on the printer's copy, and that the compositor then mistook that note for text that was to be set in type. In a somewhat different vein, F. C. Francis's Library review (cited in note 1) may also reveal something about the pre-history of the book. Francis makes two statements that are puzzling: he questions the appropriateness of the identification on page 6 of an inserted leaf as “χ1”, and he cites a statement that he thinks requires rewording: “`The symbol χ was devised to stand for an unsigned prefixed leaf or gathering', p. 20; italics mine [i.e. Francis's]” (p. 211). The first reference, however, occurs on page 7 instead of 6, and χ is not mentioned at all on page 20. Nor have I been able to find the sentence anywhere in the section Bowers devotes to “The symbols π and χ” (pp. 213- 222)—where he specifically disagrees with the statement Francis cites. It is possible that Francis simply got both page numbers wrong, but the quotation of a passage apparently not in the published book may indicate that he was working from a pre-publication text and may also point to what that text actually said. As far as the published forms of the book are concerned, alterations certainly did occur. The ones I have identified follow. 6. In the fourth line from the bottom of the final footnote, the word “of” (in the phrase “possibility of textual”) is lightly printed in the first Russell and Russell impression and almost invisible. It is inked normally in the next three printings but disappears completely in 1977, where the “v” in “variant” immediately above is slightly damaged as well. Conceivably a copy of the first Russell and Russell printing was photographed to produce the 1977 one, or possibly the same lithographic plates were used for both impressions. 12. In the first printing (and in all St Paul's reprints) the page number is improperly printed in the left margin, as a hanging indent. It is properly placed within the measure in all Russell and Russell impressions. 20. Another apparent printing error results in a duplicate of the fourth line from the foot of the page (“with some exceptions limit a book only to editions of quartos up to”) being inserted as the eighth line up. Du Rietz says that “I remember at least one messed-up passage in the original edition being mentioned in one of the contemporary reviews, thereby inviting some action to be taken in forthcoming impressions” (p. 118). He probably had in mind Francis's Library reference to this passage (p. 211). Because the text originally intended between the ninth and seventh lines up was not the same length as the nonsensical words that did appear, and because adjustments here could entail resetting the remaining fifteen lines of the paragraph, lines around the problematic passage were instead rewritten to fit the surrounding text in order that only four lines—the tenth through the seventh from the foot— had to be reset. The revision appears in all Russell and Russell printings; the original and new portions of the sentence that was changed are as follows: Limitation is sometimes decided, as in the| suggestions above for revising a plan to start a Shakespeare bibliography| [ the following line duplicates the one four lines from the foot of the page ] with some exceptions limit a book only to editions of quartos up to| book. In Limitation may sometimes be defined as| usefulness for a specific end, as in the suggestions above to confine a| Shakespeare bibliography to the editions with demonstrable textual| influence. In 85. The date in line 12 is corrected from 1640 to 1670 in the Russell and Russell printings. Lines 12, 13, and 14 are then reset, with a change of lineation: “one| recorded... title| advertising” becomes “one re-| corded ... title adver-| tising”. In the course of this replacement, lines 10 and 11 move slightly with respect to the text above them on the page. 94. The change in line 13 from “the title and preliminaries” to “the preliminaries” in the Russell and Russell impressions results in the resetting of the rest of the paragraph (lines 13-23). The distance between lines 12 and 13 is about half a millimeter greater in the revision; partly as a result, tips of some ascenders from line 13 are visible from the earlier text, over which the new setting has been pasted. Because the revision makes the new text one line shorter than the original, the paragraph is now followed by a full line space. Du Rietz observes that the new type is a bit thinner and lighter than the adjacent passages. 202. In the first collation formula (line 10 on the page), the inappropriate superscript “4” after the opening asterisk has been removed (apparently by opaquing) in the Russell and Russell printings. The deletion leaves a space between the asterisk and the subsequent hyphen. 275. In the first of the group of three examples at mid-page (line 20), “4 leaves” is corrected to “40 leaves” in the Russell and Russell copies. The entire line is simultaneously reset, in slightly smaller type. 375. In line 18 of the Russell and Russell impressions, the end of the title is corrected from “ In the Key of the Blue ” to “ of Blue ”—as William R. Parker had suggested in his review article on the original printing. 30 The final five lines of the paragraph (the correction appears in the first of these) are reset and apparently pasted onto a copy of the original printing; they are lighter than the surrounding text and tilt slightly to the lower right. Fragments of ascenders from the original setting are visible above the last four words in the first line of the new text. 433. Lines 4 and 5 are reset to correct the final word in “ The Marble Fawn ” to “ Faun ” in line 5. Again Parker noted the error (p. 222, n. 2, of the 1950 PBSA ); again the new type is lighter than the rest; and again some slight misalignment is evident (the new lines are indented minutely—by a third of a millimeter—from the left margin, though the right margin is satisfactory).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Among the interesting conclusions that arise from this examination is that the latest reprints of “McKerrow” and “Bowers” are not based on the most correct texts. Principles was revised for the first Russell and Russell printing of 1962, with the corrections retained throughout that subedition. The St Paul's printings of the 1980s and 1990s, however, reproduce the original 1949 Princeton impression, with its various errors. The most reliable reprint would be based on one of the first four Russell and Russell printings, the ones bound in blue (the fifth suffers from a disappearing word on page 6). Puzzlingly, the St Paul's publishers show no awareness of the reprintings that come before their own. Each of their impressions provides on the copyright page some indication of previous ones, in a manner that increasingly suggests it is meant to be inclusive. The most recent statement, from 1998, reports the 1949 original and the St Paul's printings of 1986, 1987, and 1994. It also explicitly calls itself the fifth—rather than the tenth, as in fact it is. This preliminary analysis of Principles also points to kinds of information relevant to a fuller investigation of its printing history. For instance, it is clear from aberrant line spacing and residual text from the photographed copy that the 1962 Russell and Russell printing was reproduced lithographically, with reset text pasted across the original before it was photographed. That knowledge in turn may provide insight into the physical processes by which the original 1949 Princeton impression was manufactured. Machine collation of the 1949 and 1962 printings reveals horizontal movement of lines 1 and 2 against 3 through 6 of the note on page 48. This variation is unlikely to have resulted from the lithographic method used to produce the 1962 printing; it may instead appear because the copy of 1949 photographed for 1962 differs from the copies of 1949 that I have collated. Such a variation in turn probably would result only if the original impression was printed from type or Linotype slugs rather than from plates (either relief or planographic). 31 The latest impression of McKerrow's Introduction is not based on the best available text either, though at least here the reprint derives from a copy that incorporates the changes publicly introduced in 1928. According to statements on successive copyright pages, the latest impression is reprinted either “photographically” (printings 3 and 4) or “lithographically” (printings 5 through 12) from “sheets of the second impression.” (The thirteenth printing says simply “ First published 1927| Thirteenth impression 1977 ”; it too descends from the 1928 revision, without acknowledging its ancestry.) Despite that account of later printings radiating from the 1928 one, a cursory identification of type damage throughout the series suggests that most new impressions derive from the immediately preceding one. Future bibliographers will need to test that proposition (recognizing that different sections of a book may have been photographed from different copies), but at the least it is clear that, whatever their assertions, some printings are not prepared directly from that of 1928. In the partial word “pensate” that begins the final line on page 11, for instance, the upper half of the stroke of “s” has a bulge from the fourth printing on; in the pagination on page 79, the stem of the “7” is broken just below the bar in all printings beginning with the sixth; and in the first line of note 2 on page 223, the “ce” of “cancellation” is partly absent from the eighth printing on. It is conceivable that incredible coincidences have made anomalies arise identically and independently in a number of printings, but it is more likely—indeed, virtually certain—that instead of being based directly on the 1928 revised printing, subsequent impressions stem from the first or later ones in each of these series, either because an early one was photographed for later impressions or because negatives or lithographic plates were reused from one to the other. In at least one instance economic factors confirm the likelihood of such a genealogy. Beginning with the third printing and continuing through the twelfth, the book was bound in gatherings of eight leaves rather than four, and the printed signatures had to be changed from the first two impressions. It then made sense to base subsequent printings with the new binding structure on a printing that had the revised set of signatures, rather than to modify a copy from 1928 every time the book was reprinted. But while not all later printings descend directly from the 1928 impression, it is also the case that not all of them derive (at least for all pages) from the immediately preceding one. The fourth printing does not repeat the third printing's “a” with the depressed shoulder in the “pensate” example (from the foot of page 11), for instance, nor are the fifth printing's anomalous instances of the number “7” (with large serifs at the upper left in the pagination for pages 78 and 79) or the extensive damage of the bottom of the “a” in “especially” (in the seventh line from the foot of page 118) duplicated in the impression that follows. Nor, for example, does the thirteenth printing follow the twelfth on page 115 in obliterating significant parts of “th” in “the” four lines from the bottom of the notes and of “Th” in “There” in the line below that. Both of these observations—that later printings are not derived directly from that of 1928, and that they also do not always descend from the immediately antecedent impression—are manifested by the 1994 St Paul's printing. The description of its text on the copyright page is on the model of that in the Oxford impressions: “ St Paul's Bibliographies... reissued the 1928 text... in 1994. ” It is first of all clear that this printing, the fourteenth, was not produced from the preceding one. The thirteenth, the first to have gatherings of sixteen leaves, has no signatures; the fourteenth, also in sixteens, seems likewise intended to have no signature markings, but vestiges of them remain from an earlier printing. The letter “H” appears at the foot of page 97, and in some copies a smudge, the slight evidence of the signature “F,” is visible under the word “for” at the foot of page 65. (As McKerrow pointed out, “we sometimes find that the compositor in setting up the reprint forgets that he has to alter the signature” [p. 194]). The fourteenth printing therefore comes from one that has those signatures—that is, from the third through the twelfth impressions. The range of possible sources is further reduced by the recognition that at line 7 of page 263 the St Paul's printing follows the sixth through twelfth impressions in omitting the “os” of “imposition” (the thirteenth printing restores these letters, albeit in a different font). The exact source of St Paul's is pinpointed by a particular page number that inexplicably appears in four different positions throughout the various printings. The “2” of “291” sometimes falls under the “e” of “printer” in the previous line—4.2 mm below it (from base line to base line) in the first seven printings, and 5.8 mm down in the eighth. After that, it occurs under the final “r”—5.6 mm below in the ninth and tenth printings, and 5.0 mm below in the eleventh through thirteenth. In the St Paul's impression the numeral is 5.8 mm below the “e”. This fourteenth printing clearly was produced from the eighth impression, an inference confirmed by the great number of “hickeys” or dirt spots that are present uniquely and identically in the two printings. 32 The best existing form of the book to use for a reprint would indeed have been the second impression (modified by inclusion of two elements from the first printing: the original Figure 9 from page 35, and, less importantly, the pagination from page 113). Progressive type damage, resulting in the disappearance of certain characters, means that impressions starting with the third are less adequate, those beginning with the sixth less acceptable yet, and those from the eighth on least desirable of all. In his review of Principles in the journal that McKerrow founded, Herbert Davis avouches that for “the student of textual problems,” bibliographical concern with late reprints “with which the author can have had nothing to do” is “sheer waste of time.” 33 Davis's assertion begs many questions even for the audience he speaks of—including how one might determine that the author in fact had nothing to do with the reprints. For readers of McKerrow's Introduction and Bowers's Principles his generalization is especially problematic, for it would seem to preclude close examination and resulting insight into the only forms of the books that most of them will encounter. What case studies like the current ones can do is to help readers of these works see particular authors and printers going about their tasks and understand better what the books are and why they are so. But such examinations also have application for all readers. Besides suggesting ways in which books might be read and studied, they provide reminders of the nature of verbal works and of how they develop, and they underscore the need to read critically at the most fundamental level, assessing the very symbols on the page. POSTSCRIPT After this article was set in type I was able to locate and consult correspondence about Principles between Bowers and the Princeton University Press. 34 These letters provide additional evidence for a number of points established by analysis of the book itself, and they cast light on several related topics as well. They also reveal that the idea behind the current paper— analyzing Principles by its own standards—is not original. On 27 March 1948 Bowers proposed to a Princeton editor, Mariam Brokow, that the book include a bibliographical note describing its gatherings and typography according to the methods the volume espoused. (Such a note was not included.) The correspondence illuminates the conceptual genesis of the book, in particular its relationship to McKerrow's Introduction. Many of Bowers's exchanges were with Datus C. Smith, Jr., director of the Press and the person who on a visit to Charlottesville in April 1946 had urged Bowers to submit his developing manuscript for the Press's consideration, even though it was only (as they then underestimated) seven-eights complete. On 3 November of that year Bowers wrote Smith, I don't pretend to be McKerrow—and the book is not a competitor of his since the subject is different—but if I'm lucky it will be a standard reference book for some time to come. Some day when I know enough I'm going to do a new McKerrow—in fact the present job started originally as a chapter in the proposed opus. As publication of Principles approached and the complexity of the undertaking became clearer, Bowers reiterated his plans: “I've something in mind in the distant future about rewriting McKerrow for Princeton if Datus doesn't lose his shirt on me this time” (Bowers to Brokow, 26 June 1949). Bowers never did get to that project, though his vision of what such a book would require seems to lie behind his disappointment with Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography. In “McKerrow Revisited” ( PBSA 67.2 [Second Quarter 1973], 109-124), Bowers concludes his review of Gaskell by pointing out that “it is deceptive to call it a New Introduction as if it were intended to act as a replacement for McKerrow.” Much of the correspondence points to the special typographical difficulties posed by the volume. The book apparently was the responsibility— and the achievement—of the Press's designer, P. J. Conkwright, who, according to a letter of 7 November 1946, preferred dropping the definite article from the proposed title The Principles of Descriptive Bibliography. A couple of weeks after publication Smith wrote Bowers, “The printing of this book was surely a challenge to all of the people engaged in the enterprise, and although we certainly would not want something of that sort to be going on around here every week, it was a stimulating experience for all of us” (13 January 1950). Smith noted that charges for Author's Alterations exceeded the amount to which Bowers was entitled without charge ($263.25) by $174.68 —and that the Press would absorb the cost: “we feel that in the case of this book many of the alterations were a function of the typographic improvisation, and a natural part of the whole job of producing a book of this sort.” Bowers insisted on paying anyway, eliciting this response from Smith on 19 January: Your note of January 17 establishes publishing history. We have received letters in the past from authors in which they say they are damned if they will pay the cost of Author's Alterations, the nature of which they profess not to understand, but we have surely never before had a letter from an author requesting the privilege of such payment. Bowers's petition was denied. One of the most important revelations of the correspondence is that Bowers himself was responsible for the alterations in Principles. Corrections had been on his mind almost from the start: on 5 December 1950 he wrote Smith, “In case you plated the book and on some future occasion ever run off more copies, for God's sake give me a chance to mend a few places, especially one where a line of type dropped out and another got repeated after I'd OK'd page proof!” When Russell and Russell decided to reprint the volume, Bowers responded to the invitation of Gordon Hubel at Princeton to make changes; in a letter of 12 December 1961 he listed the points I have identified above, except for the mispositioned page number on 12. The file also casts light on a number of other matters raised in the present article. Lawrence Wroth had identified himself to Bowers as a reader of the manuscript for the Press; the file reveals that the other reader was René Wellek. According to letters of 14 September 1946, each was paid $25. Bowers had recommended Francis R. Johnson and James M. Osborn as evaluators; according to a letter from Smith to Harold Munger at the Press on 3 April 1946, Bowers seems to have advised against asking William A. Jackson. The Press nonetheless approached Jackson and Henry Bartlett Van Hoesen, both of whom declined the undertaking. Jackson's letter of 3 May 1946 added a skeptical note: “I cannot refrain... from saying that I have my doubts as to whether any system of descriptive bibliography can be made standard even were it demonstrably the best.” The comment about Principles by Victor Hugo Paltsits (cited in note 1) was indeed not from a review but from a solicited statement Paltsits submitted on 1 August 1949 after reading galley proof; another Paltsits quotation appeared in a full-page advertisement for Principles on the back cover of Antiquarian Bookman for 21 January 1950. On 25 September 1949 Bowers encouraged the Press to send advance review copies to two major English publications, The Library and Times Literary Supplement. Because three days later the Press mailed page proof to Earle P. Walbridge, editor of PBSA (in the hope that his journal might report on the book along with or even before its review of Bühler, McManaway, and Wroth's published Rosenbach lectures), it would seem likely both that advance copies were in fact sent to the two London periodicals and that these copies too were in the form of page proof. The discrepancy between the references in F. C. Francis's Library review and the text of the published book might then be explained by the fact that he was using a pre-publication form of the work. On 21 June 1949 Miriam Brokow wrote Bowers about the “linotype schedule,” thus corroborating the method of production that seems clear from the physical evidence in the book. A few weeks after publication Datus Smith noted to Harold Munger (on 13 January 1950) that two thousand copies of Principles had been printed, at a cost of about $5900.</field>

Robin Myers contributed a retrospective review in “Descriptive Bibliography: Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description, ” Key Works in Bibliography, Antiquarian Book Monthly Review 6.9, no. 65 (Sept. 1979), 362-367. 2 Wroth had also been a reader of Principles for Princeton University Press. In a congratulatory letter to Bowers on 14 March 1950 he wrote, “I am glad that I was one of those who recommended it to the publisher” (Fredson Bowers, Papers, 1929-1992, Accession #RG-21/30, Box 103, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville, Virginia). 3 In Occasional Publication No. 4 (Nov. 1975) of the Book Arts Press, School of Library Service, Columbia University, James Green lists thirty-five instances where the first of the 1975 American printings duplicates or omits lines (based on comparison with the 1974 British impression). In two notes in PBSA (70 [First Quarter 1976], 137-138; 70 [Third Quarter 1976], 437) G. Thomas Tanselle calls attention to the 1974 revision, summarizes Green's account, identifies the two American forms labeled “Second printing,” and shows how to distinguish them. The full and complicated history of this book remains a tantalizing subject for investigation. Up to the time of its publication in paperback by St Paul's Bibliographies and Oak Knoll Press in 1995 (for which a promotional flyer included an erratum slip calling for a correction in the flyer itself), I have identified four English impressions and eleven announced American impressions—one of those, the “second,” consisting of at least two separate printings. 4 In note 7 (p. xxviii) of his Introduction to the 1994 reprint of McKerrow's Introduction by St Paul's Bibliographies and Oak Knoll Press, McKitterick notes that Greg changed the phrase “the grammar of literature” to “the grammar of literary investigation” in his essay “What is Bibliography?” In note 4 (p. 170) of “Greg's Theory of Copy- Text and the Editing of American Literature,” Studies in Bibliography 28 (1975), 167-229 (reprinted in his Textual Criticism Since Greg: A Chronicle, 1950-1985 [1987], with the dates “1950-74” added to the article title), Tanselle points out the changes made (including the introduction of one error) in the reprinting of Greg's influential essay “The Rationale of Copy- Text.” Tanselle describes modifications made for Bowers's collected Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975) on pages 30, 31, and 117 of “The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers,” published both in Studies in Bibliography 46 (1993), 1-154, and in a separate volume that took its title from the name of the article (also 1993). On page 39 he cites an instance in which Bowers added a solicitation for material for Studies in Bibliography by saying he hoped someone would follow up on a suggestion he had made in the original essay but never developed—just as I hope someone will pick up the hint in note 3 above and, in Bowers's words, “let me publish... [the] results in SB. ” 5 Quoted by Paul S. Dunkin on p. 63 of his review in Library Quarterly 21.1 (Jan. 1951), 61-64. 6 Page 183 in Modern Language Notes 44.3 (Mar. 1929), 183-184. 7 The essay was published in Transactions of the Bibliographical Society [ for 1911-13 ] 12 [1914], 211-318, and also printed separately. In the volume celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Bibliographical Society, F. S. Ferguson called this piece “doubtless the Society's outstanding publication of this decade” (p. 51 in “English Books Before 1640,” The Bibliographical Society 1892-1942: Studies in Retrospect [1945], 42-75). 8 In the “Notes,” the title “Letters of Columbus” (in the final line of footnotes on Transactions p. 302/separate, p. 86) is italicized—properly—only in the separate, and the words “of course” are set off by commas in the periodical but not in the separate (in the first note on p. 224/p. 8 and the second one on p. 237/p. 21). (The prepositional phrase itself is omitted in the corresponding note on p. 10 of Introduction and appears without commas on p. 25 of the book.) Pagination, including cross-references in notes, is appropriately modified for the different presentations, but the “Notes” are indexed only in the periodical, where they are covered in the general index to the Transactions volume. 9 Stephen Tabor, who notes the revision in his article on McKerrow in the Dictionary of Literary Biography (vol. 201: Twentieth-Century British Book Collectors and Bibliographers, ed. William Baker and Kenneth Womack [1999], 198-209), translates McKerrow's title from Japanese as English Phonetics and says that it was “co-authored and translated by his student Hiroshi Katayama” (p. 201). 10 Francis, “A List of the Writings of Ronald Brunlees McKerrow,” Library 4th ser. 21.3-4 (Dec. 1940-Mar. 1941), 229-263; updated by John Phillip Immroth in his compilation Ronald Brunlees McKerrow: A Selection of His Essays (1974), 203-238 (quotation from p. 203). 11 Principles, pp. 387-393.

In “A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary,” Studies in Bibliography 40 (1987), 1-30, he demonstrates how it might be employed in a bibliographical account. 12 Robin Myers, “The Necessity of Bibliographical Training for the Textual Critic: R.

Brett-Smith, on behalf of the Oxford University Press, wrote Bowers, “We have just published, after the usual transatlantic time-lag, your big book on The Principles of Bibliographical Description. It is going very well over here despite the high price (three times as high as McKerrow, despite Princeton's very generous price to us). Besides the usual appearances in lists, catalogues, and advertisement, we are circularising librarians about it, and I suspect that should make it really widely known. Indeed, I have just had to cable Princeton to dispatch us a further 100 copies as soon as possible” (Fredson Bowers, Papers, 1929-1992, Accession #RG-21/30, Box 103, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville, Virginia). The English price of Principles, according to reviews such as that in Library, was 63 s.; the publisher's price on the jacket of the 1949 printing of McKerrow's Introduction was 21 s. 14 Publisher's Weekly 157.4 (28 Jan. 1950), 633. 15 The St Paul's/Oak Knoll volumes contained newly commissioned introductions: on McKerrow, by David McKitterick, and on Bowers, by G. Thomas Tanselle. To accommodate them, the original pagination of the preliminaries in each volume was changed. The Spanish edition, Introducción a la Bibliografía Material, was translated by Isabel Moyano Andrés and published by the Madrid firm Arco/Libros in its series Instrumenta Bibliologica. It is based on what it identifies as the “Edición original en inglés” published by St Paul's in 1994 and includes McKitterick's essay on McKerrow. The 1994 printings of both books were distributed in the United States by Lyons and Burford, Publishers, and have that firm's name printed on the copyright page and on the back cover. A copy of the 1994 Principles that I purchased in England in 2000 has a cancel slip pasted over the title-page imprint; it says that the book is distributed by Airlife Publishing Ltd. 16 This characterization of Takano's book is by Lotte Hellinga in “Recent Books,” Library 6th ser. 13.4 (Dec. 1991), 380.

These and other publications based on Principles are recorded by Martin C. Battestin in “Fredson Thayer Bowers: A Checklist and Chronology,” Studies in Bibliography 46 (1993), 155-186 (reprinted in G.

The total bulk of the paper increases from 1.2″ to 1.4″ and then steadily diminishes to 0.8″. On the spine, the wording at the head, for title and author, remains the same, with the result that it wraps around the spine on the thin final printing. At the foot, the letters in “ RUSSELL &amp; RUSSELL ” are 3.2 mm high in the first three printings but only 2.6 mm in the other two. Correspondingly, the first “ RUSSELL ” shrinks in length from 22 to 17 mm. Differences among the printings can be summarized as follows: Impression Copyright information “Atheneum” Color ISBN Bulk “Russell” 1 Top (1962) No Blue No 1.2″ 3.2 × 22 mm 2 Top (1962) No Blue No 1.4″ 3.2 × 22 mm 3 Bottom (1962) Yes Blue No 1.2″ 3.2 × 22 mm 4 Bottom (1962) Yes Blue Yes 1.0″ 2.6 × 17 mm 5 Bottom (1977) Yes Brown Yes 0.8″ 2.6 × 17 mm In addition, the first two impressions print the city of publication and the publisher's name on separate lines on the title page, whereas subsequent printings combine them in a single line. Only the first impression includes a date (1962) in the title-page imprint. 20 I have seen these brown jackets on copies of the fourth and fifth Russell and Russell printings. The foot of the spine has the number `130'; on the front is printed, `130| BOWERS| Principles of| Bibliographical Description'. 21 I have used the Hinman Collator, the Lindstrand Comparator, and the “Comet,” a portable collator devised by University of Virginia graduate student Carter Hailey, to compare examples of the books: for McKerrow, the first (two copies), second, eighth, twelfth, and thirteenth printings, and for Bowers, the first (two copies), third, and fifth printings. I subsequently checked the results against one to four representatives of every other impression. Collations of additional printings, as well as of multiple copies of single ones, may yield further variants. I am grateful to Martin C. Battestin, Terry Belanger, Elizabeth S. Johnston, and G. Thomas Tanselle for making available their copies to compare against my own, to Robert Fleck and John von Hoelle of Oak Knoll Press for providing me with a copy of the 1998 printing of Principles and for answering questions about both works, and to the University of Virginia librarians who let me borrow these books from various reference rooms. 22 “Typographic Debut: Notes on the Long s and Other Characters in Early English Printing,” Books and Printing: A Treasury for Typophiles, ed. Paul A. Bennett (1951), 78-82, reprinting portions of pp. 309-318 of Introduction. (This publication does not appear in Immroth's update of the list of McKerrow's writings [see n. 10 above].) The excerpt, which the editor includes in order not to overlook “the professional curiosity of editors and technicians,” changes McKerrow's heading for the section; it rearranges the layout, including the paragraphing, of the original; it drops McKerrow's footnotes (while adding one of its own), though it silently incorporates some of his original notes into the text itself, either verbatim (both with and without parentheses) or in paraphrase; it changes other wording as well; it eliminates sections without notice; and it frequently (but inconsistently) alters spelling and punctuation. 23 I have seen the following reviews of Introduction.

I have not located the account in the New York Herald Tribune that is quoted on the front jacket flap of the third through thirteenth printings. The brief reference (“The best bibliographical authority in English.”) quite possibly appears in one of Mackall's later columns; in his December 1928 account of the book he referred to it as “this most valuable volume to which we hope to return again when occasion offers.” I am grateful to Elizabeth Lynch for assiduous help in tracking these reviews. The TLS review prompted an exchange of letters early in 1928 over the meaning of the term bibliography. Eventually it was concluded by an editorial note: “We cannot continue this correspondence” (22 Mar., p. 221). The participants were, in order: J. E. Spingarn (19 Jan., p. 44); McKerrow (26 Jan., p. 62), W. W. Greg (2 Feb., p. 80), A. van de Put (9 Feb., p. 96), Greg (16 Feb., p. 112), F. A. Bather (23 Feb., p. 131), Spingarn (1 Mar., p. 150), and McKerrow (22 Mar., p. 221). It is undoubtedly this exchange to which Sisson alluded in his review when he said that “there are still those who distinguish sharply between the book as a material object and the book as a thing of the spirit, and can see no connexion between the two” (p. 478); Spingarn had said that a book “is a spiritual entity of some sort” (p. 44). Winship may have had the same interchange in mind when in the opening paragraph of his own review he described two discrete understandings of bibliography. 24 The well-thumbed edges of the imposition diagram pages in many copies of Gaskell's New Introduction provide evidence of recurrent use and point to a way in which Gaskell's book, with its clear and extensive presentation of these schemes, does in fact supersede McKerrow's. 25 Page 178 in “Notes on Eighteenth-Century Bookbuilding,” Library 4th ser. 4.3 (Dec. 1923), 165-180. Chapman's talk is printed on pp. 165-177; comments by McKerrow (pp. 177-180) and Greg (p. 180) follow. 26 The inclusion of the points in Mackall's quotation of the table of contents in the New York Herald Tribune indicates that he was most likely working from the original impression—and that the late date of his account, at the end of 1928, does not provide evidence that copies of the corrected second printing were sent out for review. 27 The article appears in volume 201 of the Dictionary: Twentieth-Century British Book Collectors and Bibliographers, ed. William Baker and Kenneth Womack (1999), 198-209. I consulted the on-line form on 18 April 2000 through the Web site of the Gale Literary Databases: &lt;http://www.galenet.com/servlet/GLD&gt;. 28 W. W. Greg, “Ronald Brunlees McKerrow, 1872-1940,” Proceedings of the British Academy 26 (1940), 489-515 (p. 499). 29 Times Literary Supplement, 29 Sept. 1950, p. 620; for Esdaile and Myers, see note 1 above. 30 Page 222, n. 2, in “Principles and Standards of Bibliographical Description,” PBSA 44.3 (Third Quarter 1950), 216-223. 31 In the 1949 impression and the St Paul's subedition, the second line is minutely indented from the left margin; in the Russell and Russell reprints, it hangs ever so slightly into the margin. The total movement is less than half a millimeter, but the significance lies in the fact of the movement rather than its amount. The position of the line is the same in all four copies of 1949 that I have checked. The stability of the setting within individual lines coupled with the movement of complete lines against each other points to printing from Linotype. 32 Some examples of these extraneous marks throughout the book include: 18.9, spot above the “g” of “figure”; 80.18, a comma-like smudge after the “n” of “find”; 153.bottom line of main text, dots under both letters of “as”; 226.3, dot left of “o” in “of”; 282.9 lines up in main text, dot under “ S ” of “ Sermons ”. 33 Page 298 in Review of English Studies n.s. 3, no. 11 (July 1952), 296-298. 34 The materials are filed as Princeton University Press Archives (Co728), Series V (Additional Author Files), Box 59, Folder 1, Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library. Excerpts are published here with permission of the Princeton University Library. The folder holding the letters is cataloged and labeled as containing documents for Bowers's 1940 monograph, Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy, 1587-1642. In actuality it includes papers both for that book and for Principles —as well as for a volume edited by David Frederick Bowers, Foreign Influences in American Life (1944).</field>
