      <field name="heading_text">The Suppressed and Altered Passages in Blake's Jerusalem by David V. Erdman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following investigation began as an attempt to restore the textually significant deletions in William Blake's Jerusalem , notably the conspicuous deletions on Plate 3. It has gradually extended, in the rather surprising absence of any thorough collation of all copies of the work, into a critique of every discernible or alleged deletion or alteration that might be of value in determining the chronology of copies or the order of plates — or that might contribute significantly to our still scanty knowledge of those aspects of Blake's etching process which limited his control over his text. More or less valuable restorations of text and more or less technical analyses of mended plates fall side by side in the following plate-by-plate report, but this seems the most useful arrangement. 1 Appended are a corrected List of Copies and some notes on Catchwords, on Plate Sizes, on Blake's Numbering of the Plates, 2 and on the Dating of Blake's Script. Before Blake published his maturest Prophetic Book in "Illuminated Printing," Jerusalem: The Emanation of The Giant Albion , at least before he printed any of the copies now available for inspection (none earlier than 1818-1820 according to dated watermarks), he had erased from the copper plates from which he printed them a number of words and whole lines, most conspicuously in the prose and verse of his prefatory third plate addressed "To the Public". His method of erasure was to run a sharp tool across the raised surfaces of the copper, the printing surfaces of his relief etching. A vigorous gouging could level these surfaces beyond recovery, as it did on Plate 84. But in many instances Blake did not carry his negating beyond a few strokes, leaving a stubble of metal that would print broken outlines of letters and ghosts of words when the plates were inked and pressed. On Plate 3 most of the single-word deletions remain fairly legible, and Blake's modern editor has been able to indicate with italics his nearly certain reconstructions of such passages as: "Therefore, dear Reader, forgive what you do not approve, &amp; love me for this energetic exertion of my talent." 3 Yet a large erasure of nearly four lines in the center of the first paragraph has remained undeciphered, and the absolute blanks that show up in the excellent facsimiles of the Rinder and Mellon copies recently published by the William Blake Trust confirm the impression that this large deletion must forever defy reconstruction. Whether as Blake's "Public" we think of ourselves as "Sheep" or "goats" — words he added to Plate 3 with the same tool, perhaps with the same impulse, that deleted his expressions of love and friend-ship — it would seem we must resign ourselves to a less than perfect text. Looking at the Morgan Library Jerusalem a few years ago, however, I noticed that there were no complete lacunae on this plate but visible crumbs of letters in every part of the erasure, from which a full restoration was, theoretically, possible. The curators allowed me to examine the page under their low-power microscope and under ultraviolet radiation. Photostatic and photographic copies of this and other pages, positive and negative, on high contrast and low contrast papers, enlarged by two and by three and four diameters, were "bruized and knocked about without mercy, to try all experiments," as Blake said of some of his "experiment Pictures." Through the owner's courtesy I was able to borrow the Rosenbloom copy for several weeks, collating it directly with the Morgan copy and keeping it near at hand for photographic comparison with other copies. This posthumously printed copy, heavily inked and firmly impressed, is clearer in some plates than the other copies and, like the other posthumous copies, lacks the obscuring vines and washes that Blake applied to many of the deletions in the copies he printed himself. The upshot is the following report, which for a time I hoped to be able to entitle " Jerusalem Restored." The major passage on Plate 3 has yielded to ocular and photographic attack, and lesser but significant and sometimes astonishing passages have been recovered on other pages. There remain, however, several places where I have been unable to go beyond conjecture, some where even conjecture must be silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Method of Restoration The technique that finally yielded results was a fairly simple one, though infinitely time-consuming. Fortunately it is scientific in the sense that it can be tested and repeated, and persons who have followed a demonstration of the processes involved have been able to shed the doubts that are naturally inspired by a claim to have deciphered the supposedly indecipherable. The method used relies on the demonstrable fact that Blake's script, on the pages in question, simulates printing so precisely that the shapes of letters, the shapes of words, and the spacing between particular letters or strokes on any given page are extremely uniform. Photostatic enlargement brings the words or fragments of words up to a size convenient to use under a sheet of transparent acetate (the kind called "workable") upon which a tracing can be made with modern india ink. 4 Jerusalem 3 is reproduced below (Illustration I) in a slight reduction, but even in this size the restoration of some readings can be demonstrated. To test, for example, the hypothesis that "forgive" is the correct reading of the deleted word in the center of line 19 (two lines above the rhymed stanza) a tracing was made from the word "forgiveness" five lines above it and superimposed upon the deletion. Confirmation was immediate in this case, because the crumbs of "forgive" are sufficient for each letter, including the dot of the i and the ascender of the f , though not the descender of the g . If no counterpart of the hypothetical "forgive" had been present on the page, a model could have been constructed from "for" in the next line, the "rg" from "energetic" in the same line, the spacing of "gi" from the "gh" in "righteous" (line 15), the "ive" from "live" (line 30). The labor consists, essentially, in extending this process by applying an ink-traced hypothetical word to each group of dots in the deleted area that appears to be a discrete word, until the word attempted fits the dots. Good guesses at this stage are of utmost importance. Actually the single words that have long since been recovered are not in themselves easier to read than most of the words in the large "impossible" area of lines 7-10. The difficulty in reading this larger deletion arises chiefly from the lack of good contextual clues to supply hypothetical readings to be tested against the fragments. But the difficulty has been enhanced, for Plate 3, by some wrong guesses embedded in the Nonesuch Blake — the editor having given the word "engraving" where he should have read "arroganc[e]" and "accurs'd" where the right reading is "absorb'd" and "ideas" where it is "Gods". These were fairly close guesses, for shape and length, though the g plainly visible in the center of the first word should have ruled out the first guess. Enlargement brought out the three ascenders of "absorb'd" and ruled out the second guess. The precision of the present method makes possible a confident restoration of the deletions in the first rhymed couplet on this page (here given in italics): Reader! lover of books! lover of heaven, And of that God from whom all books are given but two famous guesses would long since have been dismissed as untenable if anyone had thought to measure them against the space available. (See Illustration II a.) Swinburne offered the reading "things" for the word in the second line now reconstructed as "books", and Professor Damon, looking more closely at the crumbs visible in the Morgan copy but not thinking of measurement, proposed "hymns". 5 The other words in the couplet are fairly legible. The s and the ascenders of b and k in "books" are there to be made out; but the ovals of "boo" are cut up beyond recognition. Only when "books" is traced from the line above and superimposed on these remnants does the exact fit demonstrate this to be the correct reading. Simple measurement of Swinburne's guess, however, or a tracing made of "thing" (to be found alone and in "nothing" just below) with an added s , would show that as Blake wrote "things" it would be a whole letter too long for this space; and a Blakean "hymns" would be almost exactly as long as the word "heaven" in the line just above. (In Illustration II a, "books" and a composite "hymns" traced from parts of nearby words have been placed below the deletion to show their respective fit and lack of fit.) Here context was perhaps too helpful; it will support any of the three readings somewhat, though once the right reading has been found it can be seen to fit most snugly of all, not merely into the broken outline on the plate but into the meaning of the whole passage: see the ensuing references to "Sinais awful cave", "the wondrous art of writing", and "my types". (Incidentally we may now abandon the suspicion that Swinburne had access to a more legible copy of this page, now lost.) With so many crumbs of letters remaining in this portion of Plate 3, although the labor of arriving at correct solutions was long, the testing and retesting of these solutions took very little time. But a further complication should be mentioned. At times Blake laced his text with interlinear drawings, such as the small flourishes in the last paragraph on this plate: "**But * I *soon found . . . syllables. ***Every *word . . ." (to represent each letter-width of drawing by an asterisk). Very early in my scrutiny of the erased passage at the top of the plate, I suspected that a little trefoil of dots in the second line (between "entrusted" and "their love") and a sort of loop-and-a-half of serpent in the third line (between "I have" and "who Acknowledge") might be remnants not of words but of ornamental drawings. I tried stubbornly to think of words that could fit these dots, but as my deciphering of words gradually closed in on these spots, it became impossible to hold out for their representing tiny words. The snake would have had to be a two-letter word, and it was not any of those I could think of. The same or similar methods, 6 with the varying degrees of success reported below, were applied to deletions on Plates 1, 2, 4, 15, 35, 36, 47, 73, 77, 82, 91, and 96. Deletions too thorough to be recoverable by any means are noted on Plates 24, 83, and (possibly) 93. Also dealt with are various mendings, deletions, and additions, most of them involving no difficulties of reading, on Plates 7, 8, 11, 22, 24, 28, 29, 37, 45, 51, and 61. Beneath the large picture on Plate 95 were discovered traces of the text now on Plate 94 and some pictorial evidence that the matter begun on a single plate had been extended to occupy two plates. Plates 96 and 99 were found to contain similar palimpsest traces of earlier use — some engraved writing on 96 and extensive pictorial matter on both plates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Nature of Blake's Alterations We know from Blake's Notebook and other manuscripts that he was an extensive reviser and rearranger of his verses before he considered them ready for publication. But once he had made a fair copy in acid-resistant varnish or ground, to be applied in reverse to the copper plate, he was able to make only minor changes. 7 Some examples of mending in the varnish are the redrawings of lower-case letters as capitals on Plates 10, 21, 24, 61, 83, and 85. The correction of "furnaes" to "furnaces" and of "garents" to "garments" on Plates 53 and 61 must have been made after transfer to copper and also after some etching had been done: the inserted letters and carets are very faint when Blake forgets to retouch them after printing; if they had been added at once, they should have been as dark as the original lettering. Before etching, or after only shallow etching, Blake could easily remove whole lines and replace them with birds or flames or tendrils drawn in varnish directly on the copper. We can hardly recover such deletions, but we can suspect their having existed, because Blake's normal paragraph spacing does not leave the exact height of a line as do some of the bird-filled hiatuses, and because there is usually some slight indention of the first line of a genuine paragraph. By the same token, we are able to detect, from signs of crowding, the late insertion of a line within a stanza break (see Plates 39 and 53). But such insertions could only be made before the acid had been applied for any length of time. When Blake called his etched or etched and engraved plates "types" or "stereotypes" he was expressing the fact that once finished his copper plates were monolithic. The illustrations could be modified by further etching (see Plate 95) or engraving, but the text was almost unalterable. Once in a while, when there was room, he could add a line above or below the block of text, by engraving. And we have seen that he could scratch out words or lines whenever he felt the need to. But it was almost impossible for him to put new words in the place of old. The complicated mending process involved in transforming one fourletter adjective into another on Plate 37 is a formidable illustration of the limits imposed on the blacksmith-poet by the nature of his medium.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His Probable Reasons Blake's reasons for making those deletions in Jerusalem which can be recovered for discussion range from the obvious to the complex to the inscrutable. Changes of plan, aesthetic and moral considerations, changed thinking, increased secretiveness, the effects of depression irreversible whether or not temporary — all appear to have operated, singly and in combination, to produce the deletions and alterations noted below as well as numerous rearrangements and replacements of whole plates, about which the evidence is highly confusing in our present state of knowledge about such things as Blake's graphics. An incalculably drastic change of plan is hinted at by the deleted phrase "In XXVIII Chapters" etched in the title page (Plate 2) of a work which in its extant form is geometrically arranged in a Fourfold scheme of four chapters. 7a The deleted "End of the 1 st Chap:" on Plate 14 does not tell us how long the chapters were to be, in any earlier scheme, because we cannot tell where this plate stood in any earlier sequence. Nor can we easily tell what to make of the date "1804" on the title page, undeleted, although it is well to recognize that the date is incised, not etched, and can have been added to the plate at any time (both in the sense that the plate may have been old or new when it was dated and in the sense that "1804" can have been added in that or, commemoratively, any subsequent year.) 8 Other deletions related to changes of plan occur on Plates 1, 29, 35 (perhaps), 37, 41, 91, and 94-95. Aesthetic as well as schematic considerations may have influenced the decision to delete all text from Plate 1, to make it a silent and sombre frontispiece to the series continuing in 26, 51, 76, 100. That Blake may not have been dissatisfied with the text of Plate 1 in itself, however, seems indicated by the fact that he made a separate "proof" in color and outlined the letters carefully in dark ink. Moral and aesthetic considerations may have combined to cause the elaborate re-engraving required to uncouple the male and female figures on Plate 28 — though here too it may be significant that a print of the first state has survived. On Plate 37 the mending of "pale . . . feet" to "blue . . . feet" may be doctrinal as well as aesthetic. Rhetorical improvements were made on Plate 4, with deletion of the double exclamation mark, and on Plate 82, with the reduction of duplication in lines 47-48 and the removal of the "redning skeleton in howling woe" from line 69. The amplification of one plate to two near the end of the work (Plates 94 and 95) may be due simply to recalculation as the 100th plate approached — or it may have involved rejection of another plate, for reasons we cannot discover, though possibly from the overriding desire to increase the "illumination" on 94-95. Changes of idea may have influenced the deletions on Plates 1 (perhaps), 4, 7, 35, 36, 47, 73, 77, 84. But the self-destructive deletions of Plate 3, withdrawing the affectionate terms addressed to the oncedear Reader, effacing and yet not quite thoroughly effacing the poet's confessions of faith and enthusiasm: these are of a different order. Blake had done something of this kind in a less irreversible way when he had added a stanza of harp-shattering despair to the Preludium of his America : at the bottom of a page, so that when his depression lifted he could cover the stanza and print the page free of gloom. The momentary effects of dismay upon the Preface of Jerusalem remain even in the most brightly colored copy, remained perhaps in his own will — for he could, after all, have made a new plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JERUSALEM : All the Deleted or Altered Passages Here are given the texts of all deleted passages in Blake's Jerusalem , with restoration where possible; also all textual additions or emendations made during or after etching or after printing. In addition the list includes deletions and revisions of pictorial matter which are (or which have been thought to be) the result of changes of state, that is, changes made in the copper plate. I have not attempted a general collation of variations in the coloring or retouching of pictorial elements in the different copies, nor of the retouching of the lettering when no alteration or deletion is involved. (Deletions or changes of catchwords and of plate numbers are dealt with in the separate addenda on these matters.) Angle brackets &lt; &gt; enclose deleted letters, words, or passages; brackets within brackets signify small deletions within larger ones. Words printed within such brackets, and unqueried, constitute certain restorations. Square brackets [ ] enclose editorially supplied letters or somewhat doubtful words (always preceded by question marks) or illegible deletions (indicated by blank space). Where the deleted text is blank or quite illegible, no conjectural words have been supplied, though possibilities are sometimes presented in the discussion following the text. Each asterisk (*) represents a segment of ornamental drawing the width of an m or less. In the deleted passages it represents fragmentary remains of what I take to have been drawing rather than text. All complete copies of Jerusalem known to exist have been examined (though the Rinder copy only in facsimile) as well as the few separate proofs or prints of single plates, as cited. Particular copies are cited (see appended list) only when there are significant variations among them. Plate 1 [Frontispiece] (Illustration III a) [ Top of page and dividing over archway: ] &lt;There is a Void outside of Existence, which if enterd into Englobes itself &amp; becomes a Womb, such was Albions Couch A pleasant Shadow of Repose calld Albions lovely Land His Sublime &amp; Pathos become His Reason his Spectrous Jerusalem his Emanation &lt;O A[ ] * [?behold] Two Rocks fixd in the Earth Power. covers them above is a Stone laying beneath [?Pitying]&gt; behold the [7] Vision of Albion&gt; [ On right side of archway :] &lt;Half Friendship * is the bitterest Enmity said Los As he enterd the Door of Death for Albions sake Inspired The long sufferings of God are not for ever there is a Judgment&gt; [ On left side of archway, in reversed writing :] &lt;Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the Sleeping Dead!&gt; All the writing on this page, designed not as a part of the text of the poem but as inscriptions on a large illustration, was applied not in etched masses but in line engraving which was so thin that Blake could easily delete it if he wished by an over-all inking of the plate. He did so in all copies of Jerusalem , but Sir Geoffrey Keynes has been able to recover the text (except for the erasures in line 7) from a proof copy in which the letters have been made visible by outlining "in black with a fine pen" against the light brown printing of the plate. 9 (Text as punctuated above derives from this copy.) Even in that proof, line 7 contains an erasure made by a gouging of the plate that left only the tops and bottoms of what I conjecture to be the b , h , l , d of "behold" and the y and g of "Pitying" (but the whole P is visible). These elements are fairly discernible in enlargements of the Rosenbloom copy and may be faintly seen in the brown and black collotype of Sir Geoffrey's proof (published with the Rinder facsimile). From the posthumous copies it is apparent that Blake considered the whole text canceled, however, and not to be brought back by careful inking; at least all copies are from the same state of the plate, slightly but significantly modified from that used for the proof. Except for the early erasure in line 7 (perhaps a correction before canceling) Blake did not scratch out any words, but he incised lines of texture for the stone of the arch and lines marking the bricks of the wall — right across his lettering. Inking could do the rest. Joseph Wicksteed suggested that the obliteration of the text from Plate 1 "was done intentionally to fit the design to function as a Frontispiece, which in Blake's Prophetic Books . . . never have any text" 10 — a rather circular argument, presenting Blake as a self-conformist who caught himself in an inconsistency. A more important consistency is that which he achieved by the tone and placing and silence of Plates 1, 26, 51, 76, and 100 — with the minor inconsistency that the lettering that remains on Plate 26 had been too broadly chiseled to be inked over. The names of "Albion" and "Jesus" on 76 could be hidden easily, and usually were. Was the original plan, after four chapters were decided upon, to have a spaced series of inscribed frontispieces? Did the idea of opacity only gradually gain ground, too late for 26? (See also the comment on Plates 51 and 76, below.) Clues to possible reasons for deletion may be found in the content of the inscriptions. The text condemning "Half Friendship" implies a plea for whole friendship and may have been jettisoned along with the words of "love and friendship" on Plate 3. The lines on the Englobing Womb are a variant of similar lines in Blake's Milton which are among the few deleted passages in that work. 11 And a drawing of the phallic altar stones alluded to here is deleted in Jerusalem 69, though only in the Rinder copy. (Noted by Wicksteed, p. 216, n.3.) The lines in reversed writing were, of course, secretive from the beginning: a direct rebuke to any verminous fiend who deciphered them in his mirror. Plate 2 [Title Page] (Illustration II b) Jerusalem / The / Emanation of / The Giant / Albion / &lt;In / XXVIII/ Chapters&gt; / 1804 / Printed by W. Blake S th Molton S t . The title was etched, the deletion subsequently made by vigorous scratching but not gouging; the date and imprint were added by engraving. The deleted phrase, directly below the "on" of "Albion", can be made out even from the Rinder facsimile now that its location and shape are precisely known. I was able to decipher it with certainty, however, only from an enlarged photostat of the Rosenbloom copy. That Blake intended the four-chaptered Jerusalem as a work in 28 Chapters, even as late as the etching of his elaborate title page, comes as something of a shock, though it may be recalled that his Milton , in Two Books, is announced on its title page as "in 12 Books" — another of the monumental plans of 1804. 12 Plate 3 [Preface] (Illustration I) Sheep goats To the Public After my three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean, I again display my Giant forms to the Public: My former Giants &amp; Fairies having reciev'd the highest reward possible: the &lt;love&gt; and &lt;friendship&gt; [5] of those with whom to be connected, is to be &lt;blessed&gt;: I cannot doubt that this more consolidated &amp; extended Work, will be as kindly recieved **************** The Enthusiasm of the following Poem, the Author hopes &lt;*no** Rea*der will think presumptuousness or arroganc[e] when he is reminded that the Ancients entrusted*** their love to their Writing, to [10] the full as Enthusiastically as I have ** who Acknowledge mine for my Saviour and Lord, for they were wholly absorb'd in their Gods.&gt; I also hope the Reader will be with me, wholly One in Jesus our Lord, who is the God &lt;of * Fire&gt; and Lord &lt;of * Love *&gt; to whom the Ancients look'd and saw his day afar off with trembling &amp; amazement.

The "Sheep" and "goats" at the top, presumably divisions of "the Public", are words not etched but engraved. They may have been added when Blake was scratching out the terms of love addressed enthusiastically to the Public in his first paragraphs. 13 All copies seem to have been printed from the same state of the plate, the relatively greater legibility of the deletions in the Morgan copy and (at some points) in posthumous copies being the result merely of differences in inking. The single deletions in lines 5, 6, 14, 21, 22, 23 can be read in most copies; they are correctly transcribed in Keynes except for the capital D in "Dear Reader" (line 21). In the Harvard copy the large deletion of lines 9-12 is partly covered by drawings of vines, as also the deletion in line 24, but the same impression marks are discernible beneath. So are they in the Mellon copy, beneath washes and lines of color. Some of the other deletions in the Morgan copy are hidden with vines, but not these; for whatever reason the plate seems to have been inked and impressed with particular care. Details of restoration are given in my introductory remarks. Only the final e of "arrogance" leaves no trace in any copy. The deletions at the end of line 36 and in the second half of line 37 remain baffling, although crumbs of some specific letters are visible and we are obviously faced with deleted text, not ornament. In line 36 the phrase may be "to Hear" or "to Note". In 37 the lower edge of a g seems attached to the first d of "dictated" in the next line; another g or a y is evident above the word "me". Certain ascending strokes are also to be made out. It should be observed that the period given after "Sleep" in line 36 might be a comma. Blake used a dot-like mark that must be read sometimes as comma, sometimes as period. Plate 4 ("Chap: 1") . . . . Beaming forth with her daughters into the Divine bosom. &lt;Where ! !&gt; [15] Where hast thou hidden thy Emanation lovely Jerusalem . . . . But the perturbed Man away turns down the valleys dark; &lt;Saying, We are not One: we are Many, thou most simulative&gt; [23] Phantom of the over heated brain! shadow of immortality! . . . . Editors have observed the deleted "Where" in line 15 but have failed to note the exclamation marks: these are deleted not by scratching but by treatment as part of the marginal network (and by blue wash in the Mellon copy). Line 23, read from enlargements of the Morgan and Rosenbloom copies, is almost invisible beneath vines or washes in the others. With removal from line 15 of the redundant and exclamatory "Where ! !" the text is considerably reduced in histrionics (there are still seven exclamation marks in the first ten lines of the page). But the deletion also removes, perhaps inadvertently, the required seventh foot of the line. The deletion of line 23 is more seriously disruptive, since it removes an indicator of the dialogue ("Saying") and half the epithet meant for the one addressed ("simulative Phantom"), and because it obscures an important element in the poem's definition. This plate opens Chapter 1, and readers would have been helped by so explicit a definition of perturbed Man's error as the now hidden assertion, "We are not One: we are Many." 14 Plate 7 . . . . O holy Generation &lt;Image&gt; of regeneration! [65] . . . . The word "Image" was scratched through for deletion, but not replaced; it is illegible or nearly so in every copy except the Cunliffe and the Harvard, in both of which it has been retouched into legibility. Can this deletion have signified some temporary doctrinal change — or does Blake's failure to repair it in other copies represent negligence? Plate 10 In line 47 the word "Righteous" is mended, before etching, from "righteous". Plate 11 Between the text and the bottom illustration there is a shadow that might be the top of a deleted line, but careful measurement dispels the idea. Plate 14 &lt;End of the 1 st Chap:&gt; This colophon, in catchword position, is severely deleted; clearly visible only in the Rosenbloom copy. 15 (The plate number, probably 14, is not clearly visible in any copy, but the text is tightly linked with Plate 13, which is visibly numbered "13".) Plate 19 According to the Census the small recumbent figure below the large recumbent figure at the bottom of the plate is absent in the Cunliffe copy. Its absence is evidently a matter of coloring and probably does not indicate a different state of the plate. (Not personally examined.) Plate 20 This plate is one of the few that occurs in two states. In the first state, found in a separate leaf in the Rosenwald collection (with undeleted "16" incised in top right corner) and in the British Museum and Rinder copies, there are three wave-like points of flame or gown in the top right corner, the central point about 1 cm. from the corner of the plate. In the second state, alike in every other particular, the central tip has been extended to within 3 mm. of the corner and accompanied by a thin line on each side of it. This extension cuts into the numeral "16" but can hardly have been made simply to delete the number. This state appears in the Harvard, Mellon, Morgan, and posthumous copies, though in the Mellon a further change is made with black wash over the waves, practically eliminating them. (In the Cunliffe copy no number is visible, and the coloring of the illustration makes it difficult to determine the state of the plate.) The variant does establish a chronological separation between the first two complete copies and the later ones. Plate 21 In line 37 the C of "Childrens" is mended from a lower-case c , before etching. Plate 22 In line 10 the first letter of "Hatred" is mended, somewhat inadequately. It was first written as an R , probably in anticipation of the word "Right" in the next line. In line 13, "coutenance" is mended to "countenance" before etching. Plate 24 . . . . Dost thou forgive me? thou who wast Dead &amp; art Alive? [58] . . . . I die! I die in thy arms tho Hope is banishd from me. [60] &lt;[ ]&gt; Thundring the Veil rushes from his hand Vegetating Knot by Knot. . . . The D and A of "Dead" and "Alive" in line 58 were mended from lower-case letters, before etching. After line 60 a full line was deleted, perhaps after shallow etching, for a few faint shadows of parts of letters remain. A line related to line 60, including "Hope is banish'd from me" (Albion's last words), is deleted and varied on Plate 47 (which see). Plate 26 Stigmata, or rather the raised heads of spikes, are visible in the palms of "Hand" in all copies but the British Museum and the Mellon, where they are hidden by drawing but not truly deleted. In the Mellon copy bright spots of red are added to Hand's ankles. (Compare note on Plate 35.) Plate 27 In line 15 "Willans" is not very legible except in the Mellon copy, where it has been retouched. The word may have been corrected on the copper from "Williams". Plate 28 ("Chap: 2.") (Illustrations IV a, b) This plate is described in such a way in the Keynes-Wolf Census (p. 106) as to suggest that there were four states of the copper. I find only two states, one represented by the proof on 1802 paper which is tipped into the Morgan copy, the other represented by the adjacent page in the Morgan copy itself and by all other copies including the posthumous ones, in which the exact condition of the copper plate may be seen. The "states" noted in the Census are variants of coloring and inking; they establish no sequence of issue. Unhappily the Census descriptions of each "state" are erroneous in major details. A correction of these is of importance both bibliographically — this being the only plate in Jerusalem thought to contain evidence establishing priorities among more than two groups of copies — and, in a sense, semantically or textually: for although the actual text is unchanged, the picture which fills the top half of the plate and announces a new chapter is radically changed in its second state. Most of the implications of this change do not fall within the present discussion, but one of them is potentially chronological. To put it simply, the primary change Blake made in this plate, picturing female and male figures embracing in the center of a "lilly of Havilah", involved turning the legs of the two nude figures from a position in which they can be assumed to be copulating to one in which they cannot. The change was made by extensive additional engraving of the etched and engraved plate. The secondary changes, both in the engraving and in the retouching in the British Museum, Mellon, and Morgan copies, are largely consequent upon it. Joseph Wicksteed in his Commentary (pp. 159-160 and 204) is extravagantly impressionistic in his interpretation and in his details but appears to have grasped the primary change correctly. The Census , while reporting the degrees of clearness with which certain (to me invisible) "genitals" appear in various "states" of the plate, assigns to the male and female figures a position in the first state which would be as essentially chaste as their position in the later. Confusion of left and right may cause some of the difficulty, and confusion of references to the "woman" (presumably the smooth-faced figure on the left) and the "man" (the short-haired figure on the right, on whom Wicksteed sees a beard, and whose back muscles are knotted in the first state). In the 1802 proof, according to the compilers of the Census , "the woman's right thigh [is] visible parallel to and underneath her left; the man's left leg encircles her body; the moulding of the man's back is clear; a caterpillar is below the figures on the leaf." Correction: Only in the second state does the woman have two visible thighs, parallel. In the first state only her right thigh is visible — not underneath but above and parallel to the left thigh of the man. His leg does not encircle her but is bent back at the knee so that his foot is, quite visibly, beneath his left buttock. It is his right arm that encircles her waist, for we see what must be his right hand resting on her right hip. No right leg for the man or left leg for the woman is in the picture. The caterpillar, on the petal ("leaf") below the man, is not attached to him, though grossly phallic if you will. Census : "In the second state . . . the woman's right thigh and the man's left leg have been removed; only ineffective cross-hatching remains on the man's back; the caterpillar has been removed; the man's genitals are defined." Correction: In the second (and final) state of the plate the woman has two visible thighs, for the first time, a left thigh having been created for her out of what was the man's left thigh, so that she now appears to sit side-saddle on the petal. The man's left leg below the knee has been removed by an upward spread of the petals he rests upon; he has been given a right thigh, and his buttocks have been (ineffectively) moved round to the left, so that he is now sitting side-saddle and turned the other way from the woman. His back muscles are flattened (and his spine surely broken). The caterpillar has been (almost) removed by additional engraving of all the petals. In neither state can any genitals be seen on either figure; curiously enough even the compilers of the Census see that the man has his back to the viewer in either state. They cite "copy D" (the Harvard) for this "second state" (skipping the Rinder) and find a "third state . . . in copy F" (the Morgan), with "the genitals less clearly shown; the leaf below Chap. 2 . . . lightened, and the white lines increased on the lower part of the leaf on which the woman's leg extends." Laborious comparison of photographic copies with each other and with the originals in turn has failed to disclose the slightest difference in any part of the picture except for ink lines added in a few places in the British Museum and the Morgan copies and more elaborate drawing in the Mellon copy. The posthumous copies make it clear that no lines were added to the plate or subtracted from it. (Patchy inking in the Harvard copy does give a vaguely phallic appearance to a portion of the female's right leg, but comparison with other copies makes evident the accidental nature of this effect.) Keynes and Wolf discern, nevertheless, a "final state" in the colored (Mellon) copy "and all the posthumous ones": "all indications of the genitals removed; the man's right hand . . . eliminated." Here theory supplants observation, for the right hand is painted over in the Mellon copy — but reappears in the posthumous plates. Wicksteed's Commentary makes out a tremendous difference between the Rinder and Stirling (Mellon) copies, defining the male and female as "almost completely mingled" in the first state and as "distinct individuals, whose bond is expressed by the embrace of their arms and not by amalgamation" in the later: a distinction implying that intercourse destroys individuality. Graphically, from the waist up, the two figures are just as much "distinct individuals" in one state as in another, even if we include "states" made by supplementary coloring. 16 As for the bibliographical deduction that seems possible the drastic change implies, I should think, a revised attitude toward copulation (or increased sensitivity to moral disapproval from dear Readers) which in turn may imply the passage of years rather than days. Though admitting of more than one explanation or interpretation — as does the early date, "Edmead &amp; Pine 1802", of the paper of the proofs of Plates 28, 45, and 56 — the point is worth bearing in mind. Some day enough biographical, stylistic, and graphic evidence may accumulate to make it useful. Plate 29[43] 17 (Illustration II c) . . . . All is confusion: all is tumult, &amp; we alone are escaped &lt;!&gt;[82] So spoke the fugitives; they joind the Divine Family. &lt;?Albion ?slept]&gt; [ mended to ] trembling A laborious mending at the end of line 83, the last line on Plate 29, replaced an earlier word or words with "trembling" and cut into the punctuation mark in line 82, a colon or exclamation point. My reconstruction of the earlier reading, "Albion slept", fits the space but remains somewhat conjectural. 18 The "tr" of "trembling" was very crudely hacked, the "bl" given imperfect ascenders, and the "g" not effectively built up at all. Blake always had to retouch the b , l , and g to make them clear. The appearance of the plate when retouching was neglected can be seen in the Rinder copy and in posthumous ones. Such imperfect mending, even at the corner of the plate, suggests that Blake was not free to hammer the back — or else that the chief purpose of the mending was to efface the earlier reading and that he counted on retouching to perfect the page. Plate 35[31] (Illustration III b) . . . . So spoke the voice from the Furnaces, descending into Non-Entity [17] &lt;To Govern the Evil by Good: and [?States] abolish [?Systems].&gt; The last line is not fully legible in any copy, but enlargements of the Morgan, Fitzwilliam, and Rosenbloom copies, collated, made clear all but the words probably, but conjecturally, to be read as "States" and "Systems." "States" is a void with several crumbs of letters in it. The y of "Systems" is certain and the S probable and that word does fit the space. The deleted line would have ended the page and may have led to further discussion of Evil and Good, if not States and Systems, in some earlier position; no surviving plate opens on these themes. The preceding and following pages are in a different style of lettering, and one could plausibly argue from contextual looseness of fit that this is a plate of late insertion. 19 Yet the deleted line may have been removed because of its aphoristic simplicity. Compare Plate 4. The stigmata in the hands and feet of the soaring figure at the top of the plate derive in all copies from a single state of the plate, though in the Mellon copy only those in the feet are brought into prominence. In the Harvard copy, in the one visible ankle of the lower figure, there is a deep erasure (or possibly a defect in the paper) retouched in grey to create a stigma where none was in the etching. (Compare Plate 26 in the Mellon copy.) Plate 36[32] . . . . And the Four Zoa's who are the Four Eternal Senses of Man Became Four Elements separating from the limbs of Albion These are their names in the Vegetative Generation [33] &lt;[?West][ ] dividing Generation [ ]&gt; And Accident &amp; Chance were found hidden in Length Bredth &amp; Highth The Fitzwilliam copy is clearest in the first part of line 34, the Morgan copy in the latter part, the Mellon copy perhaps all through (and not vine-covered or washed); yet deletion by scratching was too thorough for a complete or confident restoration. Except for the final word, I can propose a conjectural reading which seems to fit the few fragments of letters discernible and is at least not contradicted by any fragments or by the context: "West Weigh[ing] East &amp; North dividing Generation South [ ]g". The colon which Keynes (p. 663) supplies at the end of line 33 may be misleading. "These" may refer only backward to "Senses" and "Elements" in the preceding lines and not to anything in the deleted line. Or is Blake intentionally removing a key to his symbols? "Zoa's", the first word in line 44, is described as "indistinct in Blake's autotype" by Sloss and Wallis (1, 511); yet I find it clear in all copies examined. These editors seem occasionally to have misread their own notes and to report difficulties where none exist. Plate 37[33] (Illustration V a) And One stood forth from the Divine Family &amp; said [1] . . . . So Los spoke: But when he saw &lt;pale&gt; [ mended to ] blue death in Albions feet, [10] . . . . The Census describes the "last four words of the first line" of this plate as "incised instead of stereotyped" 20 but fails to note that the first six words of the line were also incised or engraved, though in relief instead of intaglio. In short the whole first line was added to the plate after etching. Wicksteed (p. 166) builds a precarious structure of speculation upon the deduction that "Blake made at least one attempt to obliterate his first line . . . and another attempt to restore it " (Wicksteed's emphasis). The attempt to obliterate, I suppose, is the fact that the line prints badly; the attempt to restore, the fact that in the Mellon copy the whole line is retouched (being especially pale in light brown ink). What Blake really seems to have attempted (with rough success) was to cut the first six words in relief, a process that required applying the letters in reverse on the smooth copper at the base of the illustration and then cutting around their outlines and hatching the background. With the seventh word Blake reverted to the traditional copperplate engraver's hand (incised in reverse line) with evident ease, though at a faulty angle. 21 One might conjecture that Blake made this switch with the intention of giving a sort of italic distinction to the concluding words ("Divine Family &amp; said"), but the technical explanation — that the first process was too laborious — should suffice. There are no grounds at all for Wicksteed's supposition that Blake had "some perplexity in his mind" about what he wanted to write. The mending of "pale" to "blue" in line 10 was perhaps a continuation of the impulse that produced the six raised words in line 1. But here instead of beginning with a smooth raised surface, Blake had only the raised surfaces of the word "pale" to work with, plus whatever he could build up on the plate beside them. He could leave the final e unchanged, but to mend "p" to "b" and "al" to "lu" he had to cut away the descending stroke of the p and the ascending stroke of the l (which he managed incompletely, leaving visible crumbs) and then somehow to build up the metal for the ascenders of "b" and "l" (as he did with visible gaps). The remaining segments of the old letters could be made into the new by judicious excisions. The result demonstrates again (compare Plate 29) how limited the possibilities were for changing etched lettering. Simpler to make lacunae, to fill with tendrils. (Nevertheless it must not be supposed that Blake had never learned how to delete and re-engrave or re-etch a small area or large by punching the copper from behind and burnishing the raised area for a fresh start. See the clusters of punch marks that scar the backs of the Gough plates, now in the Bodleian, which were made during Blake's apprentice days in James Basire's shop, some of them by Blake himself. The presumption must be that Blake was using the backs as well as the fronts of his plates and that what was already etched on the back of Plate 37 was not something slated for cancellation. See appendix on Sizes of Plates.) A proof of this plate in a state before any tampering with the word "pale" is in Sir Geoffrey Keynes's collection and may be seen in collotype reproduction in the Census (facing p. 106). The compilers are wrong to describe the British Museum copy as "in the earlier state" (p. 113) if this means that the page was printed from the plate before the mending. The reading of this copy is "pale" rather than "blue", but it was effected by a retouching, in somewhat darker ink, of a printing from the mended plate. 22 All four copies of Jerusalem , in short, derive from the same state of the plate, with its imperfect mending of "pale" to "blue", but in the British Museum copy Blake restored the original word—a wavering not repeated in the other copies. (The Rinder facsimile shows "blue" with no trace of "pale", but the evidence of the posthumous copies proves this effect to have been the result of inking—or of the making of the facsimile. The state of the unretouched plate is clearly exhibited in the Mellon copy and in its facsimile.) Both this revision and the addition of line 1 suggest an early plate being adapted to changed context. There is no catchword on the preceding plate; there is a catchword on this plate (37) fitting the top of Plate 38 — and it may be noted that Plate 38 was once numbered "6". The textual reason for the change from "pale" to "blue" was probably Druidic: further on (J 65:4-5) Albion is "staind . . . with poisonous blue . . . To die a death of Six thousand years . . . ." 23 Plate 39[35] Line 6, "For Human beauty knows it not; nor can Mercy find it! But", has been crowded into a stanza break, after the initial inscription of the page but before etching. The indention of the first word should be taken as still marking a new paragraph. Line 10, "And here begins the System of Moral Virtue, named Rahab.", is similarly crowded in before etching but not indented. I should be inclined still to treat the following line as a new paragraph, but Blake's final intention is not plain. Plate 40[36] . . . . Gloucester and Exeter and Salisbury and Bristol; and benevolent Bath [61] The word "Bath" at the end of Plate 40 is repeated as the first word of Plate 41. It stands where it might seem to be a catchword yet can equally well represent the final word of line 61, crowded below the line for lack of space. Sloss and Wallis pass over it as a true catchword; Keynes ("rightly," says Wicksteed) treats it as the true ending of the line. Keynes and Wicksteed are right, but the evidence is not easy to evaluate. "Bath" is not separated from the rest of the text, by ornament or spacing, as are the true catchwords in Jerusalem (this is, I think, the most decisive point); yet Blake himself appears to have mistaken it for a catchword when he was inking or retouching this plate. In the British Museum copy "Bath" is legible enough; in the Rinder copy it is deleted, apparently by underinking. The posthumous copies show that it was not deleted on the plate, but then a catchword that still worked would not have been deleted there, either. In the Morgan copy "Bath" is retouched, in the same greyish ink used to mend other words in this copy, including some nearby catchwords. 24 In the Harvard copy the word is retouched, but carelessly, the B written as a D , perhaps from confusion of this plate with Plate 44, where the word "Death" is in the same position — and is not a catchword. In the Mellon copy one can see that the lower parts of the "th" did not print clearly and have not been retouched; also a line of border has been drawn so close as to scathe these letters — yet "Bath" has not been drawn over with loops, as have some true catchwords in that copy. If we reject "Bath" as a catchword, however, we cannot continue to argue that one of the plates beginning with that word had to follow. Plate 45[40] . . . . And these the names of the Eighteen combining with those Ten [40] Line 40 is an engraved addition to the plate, after etching, made in what was originally the bottom border. It is present in all copies except the proof page, unnumbered and on paper watermarked "Edmead &amp; Pine 1802", tipped into the Morgan copy. This might suggest an early date for the original plate, but Keynes and Wolf ( Census , p. 112) think it likely that this and the two similar proofs were made on paper that just happened to be old, and Wicksteed (p. 178) finds reason in the pictorial and verbal symbolism to regard this plate as "one of the latest and maturest" in the book. The symbolism is certainly not especially early, and the script is approximately that of the majority of the plates. The added line, however, does show that it was made before the present arrangement of plates, that it was first made for one position and later modified to fit another, in short that this plate cannot be very strictly described as "one of the latest". The historical allusions in the text do not call for a date later than 1808 — if my conjectures are valid that the voice of "Bath" is that of the pacificist Richard Warner and (more certainly) that the cutting of the chains of "Africa" signifies the abolition act of 1807. 25 Plate 47 &lt;When Albion utterd his last words Hope is banishd from me&gt; [1] . . . . Therefore I write Albions last words, Hope is banish'd from me. [18] The deleted first line can be read in the Harvard, Morgan, and Mellon copies, but it is sufficiently scratched out to be inconspicuous on the page. The reason for the deletion is more likely to have been a rearrangement of plates (note the closeness in text to the line above the early deletion in Plate 24) than a decision to remove the redundancy of lines 1 and 18; in the positions of first and last lines on the plate, these could be read as a characteristic Blakean refrain. Plate 51 [ Inscribed beneath pictures, in separate prints only :] Vala Hyle Skofield [ Incised in lower left corner, and visible in British Museum, Morgan, and posthumous copies and separate prints :] W B [ in monogram ] inv &amp; s Blake evidently put his monogram on this pictorial plate for issuing as a separate print (several examples of which are alluded to in Keynes's Blake Studies , p. 115; Census p. 113). He let the ink cover it when printing the Rinder, Harvard and Mellon copies; yet it can be detected in the Harvard. The Census reports an impression now in the collection of Sir Geoffrey Keynes with the names "Vala Hyle Skofield" "in white line" and the signature, quoted as "W B inv." The posthumous copies prove that the names were never on the plate; they do not appear in any copies of Jerusalem ; "white line" must mean white ink, not incision; the Census statement that "this lettering is present in some copies, though mostly obliterated by heavy inking", ought perhaps to read: "present in some (or one) separate print(s) but not visible elsewhere." Plate 53 Line 8, "Their Giant forms condensing into Nations &amp; Peoples &amp; Tongues", appears to have been added within a stanza break, after inscription of the page but before etching. In line 20 "Furnaes" is corrected to "Furnaces" by insertion of a c above the line and a caret below, apparently in late stages of etching. To be clearly visible the correction had to be retouched, as it is in the Mellon and Morgan copies. It is faintly visible in the Rinder and in the posthumous Rosenbloom copies but not to be seen in the British Museum, the Harvard, or the Rosenwald. Line 24, "The Mystic Union of the Emanation in the Lord; Because", appears to have been added within a stanza break, before etching. This knits two stanzas into one, whereas the line 8 insertion still leaves line 9 as, in effect, the beginning of a new stanza. Plate 56 Subservient to the clods of the furrow! the cattle and even The emmet and earth-worm(s) are his superiors &amp; his lords. [37] Lines 36-37 of this plate were etched right across the plate-maker's stamp (on the back of the plate) and hence printed badly in all copies. In the Morgan copy Blake retouched several spots with pen and ink — and then added an s to "earth-worm". Was this done from aesthetic choice, as it might well have been, to match worms with cattle instead of emmet? Or from a hasty assumption that a plural noun was required before "are"? The correction does not appear in any other copy. "The singular character of the engraved script" of this plate (matched, we may note, in Plates 61 and 88) led Sloss and Wallis (I, 548) to infer a late addition. From the same singularity Wicksteed (p. 208) infers that Plates 56 and 61 were "probably . . . the two earliest Plates to be etched for the Work." Possible evidence of an early date is the existence of a proof of Plate 56 (tipped into the Morgan copy) on paper with an 1802 water-mark — though I am inclined to accept the Census hypothesis that the three proof pages of this sort were made much later than the date of their paper. Wicksteed further calls attention to the narrowness of the plate, but narrowness in itself does not afford any evidence of earliness or lateness (see addendum on Sizes of Plates). There may, however, be an indication of earliness in the fact that Plate 56 shares its odd size with Plate 95. If these two pages were made from the opposite sides of the same piece of copper, they may have been made at about the same date. Plate 95 does seem to have been originally etched rather early, since before final use Blake drastically remade the plate; yet even so, Plate 56 would have been made after 95 because it uses the back of the copper. Perhaps the most datable feature of these pages will prove to be their style of lettering. But their most striking difference from adjacent (later or earlier pages), which nobody seems to have remarked upon, is surely their style of poetry: O it was lost for ever! and we found it not: . . . . . . . I mind not your laugh; and your frown I not fear! . . . and so on. 26 Plate 61 In line 40 the first two letters of "Chaldean" are mended from "ch", probably in the varnish. In line 51 "Garents" is corrected to "Garments" by insertion of an m above the line and a caret below (compare Plate 53). The Census reports this correction in copies D and E, meaning either the Mellon and Morgan or the Harvard and Mellon. Actually it is visible in all copies except the Rinder. It was made in a late stage of etching and is faint unless retouched, as it is in the British Museum and Harvard copies. Plate 63 In line 40 the last word, "Danube", is perfect in all copies except the Harvard, where the drawing of the marginal border covers the e and the bowl of the b . A purely accidental deletion. Plate 69 In line 1 the fifth word was etched "combined" but mended to "conjoined", the m being cut and given a tail to make "nj" and the b cut to "o". In the Mellon copy, however, the word is erased from the paper and the original "combined" is restored by pen and ink. Plate 73 (Illustration V b) . . . .

The Rinder facsimile shows few traces of the deleted kings in line 37 and only enough of line 42 to reveal the name of Virgil among the deleted prophets. In the Mellon copy Blake drew green vines and in the Morgan looping tendrils over the erased names. But the Harvard copy shows more and the Rosenbloom copy, enlarged, reveals enough to leave nothing in my reconstruction conjectural. The unexpected names among the preservers, to me, were Pythagoras and Euripedes (sic). Only one queen is put among the Satanic but glorious Kings of England. In 1954, I speculated that Blake had scratched away the names after Richard and John "as a precaution against Watch-fiends" ( Blake : Prophet , p. 385). I did not try to guess why he also scratched away the countervailing names after David and Ezekiel. Presumably he did so to keep the balance in Eternity. Now that we see what the names all were, other reasons suggest themselves. The Blake who wrote scathingly in the 1820's of "Homer, Virgil &amp; Ovid" and found "Tyrannical Purposes" in Dante's Comedia 27 may have had direct reasons for reducing his list of prophets; yet Milton at one end, and some of the kings at the other, may have had to go simply to make whole-line deletions. A similar, yet impersonal, deletion occurs, however, in both of the late copies of Milton (in both the New York Public Library and the Rosenwald copies, despite Keynes's note of erasure in only "one copy"): But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry, Painting, Music, And Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man. Not so in Time &amp; Space: there Three are shut out, and only Science remains thro Mercy: &amp; by means of Science, the Three Become apparent in Time &amp; Space, in the Three Professions &lt;Poetry in Religion: Music, Law; Painting, in Physic &amp; Surgery:&gt; That Man may live upon Earth till the time of his awaking, . . . (27:55-61) Plate 76 [ Incised below figures in the picture :] Albion Jesus From posthumous copies we can see that the names "Albion" and "Jesus" below the figures in this full-page engraving are cut into the plate in about equal strength. But in some copies Blake, by selective inking, deleted the name "Jesus", in some both names. Both are clear in the British Museum copy. "Jesus" is deleted in the Rinder and Morgan copies but "Albion" is clear, being touched with white in the latter copy. Both names are hidden in the Harvard and Mellon copies. Wicksteed (p. 220) explains: "The name ALBION appears in most prints . . . below the youthful figure who might otherwise be mistaken for LOS. The name JESUS is less necessary, but is also found in many copies." Compare, however, the deletion of allusions to Jesus in Plate 3. Wicksteed's "many" and the Census generalization (see next footnote) obscure the fact that "Jesus" is deleted in all copies made by Blake except the British Museum copy. (The posthumous should not count.) The apples on the tree, four on each side, go through a different evolution: barely visible in the British Museum copy, and hidden in the Rinder and Harvard copies, they are retouched in white in the Morgan copy, in black and gold (and increased to six on the left side) in the Mellon. It took careful inking, or retouching, to bring out these fine-line elements. All copies were printed from the same state of the plate. 28 (The nail heads are outlined in black in the Mellon copy, as they are not on Plate 51.) (In the Harvard copy the apples are outlined in black on black, with ambiguous effect: probably to cover white lines left after printing, but possibly to assert the apples' muted outlines.) Plate 77 (Illustration VI a) [ Incised in bottom corners :] &lt;The Real Selfhood in the [ ]thin P[ ] T[ ]m&gt; Extensive photographic attack has not recovered more of this deleted inscription than Sir Geoffrey Keynes was able to read in the Fitzwilliam copy ( Complete Writings , p. 919), except for a trace or two of the doubly deleted second line. The word below "Selfhood" may be "within". To indicate the lengths of the other words, a purely speculative reading can be invented: "The Real Selfhood / is our Spectre within / in the / Poisonous Term". Whatever the message, covered with thick foliage in the Mellon copy, it was perhaps first written as a sort of marginal motto. Then deep horizontal lines of shading were gouged across the letters, and, outside this pattern, the first and last words in the bottom line were directly erased by scratches. Plate 82 . . . . I have naild his hands on Beth Rabbim &amp; his hands on Heshbons Wall . . . . [43] So saying: She drew aside her Veil from Mam-Tor to Dovedale Discovering her own perfect beauty to the Daughters of Albion And Hyle a winding Worm &lt;be&gt;neath &lt;her Loom upon the scales. Hyle has become a winding Worm:&gt; &amp; not a weeping Infant. [48] . . . . To feed the afflicted in the Furnaces: She minded not The raging flames, tho she returnd &lt;consumd day after day, [67] A redning skeleton in howling woe:&gt; instead of beauty Defo[r]mity: she gave her beauty to another: . . . One of the words "hands" in line 43, probably the second, is a mistake for "feet". Other signs of extreme carelessness on this plate are the misspellings: "Defo[r]mity" (line 69), "siste[r]s" (72), "soften[in]g" (77), and "Furna[c]es" (78, 79). Mended letters include the first w in line 5 and the second b in 21. The deletions in lines 47-48 and 67-68 are inked over with vines in the Mellon, Harvard, and Morgan copies but are almost legible in the Rinder copy and can be made out completely from the posthumous ones, by enlargement. 29 The excision in lines 47-48 removes a redundancy (but the cut into "be" of "beneath" seems an accidental slip of the tool). 30 The excision in lines 67-68 if it does not improve at least does not make any worse the syntactical context of the dangling phrase, "instead of beauty Deformity". 31 Everything about this plate suggests that it was prepared in a condition of unusual haste, or inattention, or illness, and that the text was not freshly composed but transcribed from a fair copy of much earlier vintage — consider particularly the "redning skeleton", inscribed and etched but then rejected. From the style of lettering (and from the crowding of the plate) I would conjecture a late date of etching. Plate 83 In line 30 the A of "Affection" is mended from lower case a in the varnish, before etching. Plate 84 (Illustration VI b) The Corner of Broad Street weeps: Poland Street languishes To Great Queen Street &amp; Lincolns Inn all is distress &amp; woe, [16] &lt;[ ]&gt; &lt;[ ]&gt; &lt;[ ]&gt; The night falls thick Hand comes from Albion in his strength Some crumbs of letters remain here and there in these three gouged-out lines, but too few for any hope of reconstruction — a great pity, for Blake's neighborhoods were apparently the subject matter. Perhaps he was erasing as the place names reached toward his present life. 32 Tendrils are added in the Harvard and Mellon copies. Plate 85 In line 11 the M of "Myriads" is mended from lower case m in the varnish before etching. Plate 90 In line 58 the A of "And" is mended from lower case a before etching. Plate 91 &lt;Forgiveness of Enemies ?can [ ] only [ ] God [ ]&gt; [1] It is easier to forgive an Enemy than to forgive a Friend: . . . . We seem very close to a restoration of this deleted first line, but the deeper gouges baffle: the deletion is not made by hatching but by a scooping out of the centers of words. Redundancy (of lines 1 and 2) or a changed position in the sequence of plates might account for the deletion — but until we know what exactly was erased we cannot safely speculate about the motive. Tendrils are added only in the Harvard copy. Plate 93 Enitharmon heard. She raisd her head like the mild Moon [1] &lt;[ ]&gt; In the blank space following line 1 are slight traces of a deletion, irrecoverable and probably made in the varnish. Can it have consisted of an extension of the epic, but brief, simile "like the mild Moon"? That would be an early manner. Plate 94 . . . . O all ye Nations of the Earth behold ye the Jealous Wife [26] The Eagle &amp; the Wolf &amp; Monkey &amp; Owl &amp; the King &amp; Priest were there The concluding line, 27, may be a late addition. From the evidence on Plate 95 (see comment) three conclusions can be drawn: that the text of Plate 94 was transferred without substantial change (beyond the addition of line 27, perhaps) from its earlier position on what is now Plate 95; that the picture at the top of the page is new; and that the picture at the bottom of the page lacked, in its earlier version which is still partly discernible beneath a later picture on 95, the rays of light and the dolmen on the horizon. The Census (p. 110) describes the two pictures on Plate 94 thus: "Above, a threefold man supine. Below, a woman lying face downwards on the body of an old man; Druid stones and a sunset [or sunrise?] glow in the background." The only error of retranscription appears to be "Chastitity" for "Chastity" in line 23. See comment on Plate 56 for the inference that this text is of early origin. Plate 95 [Note: In this exceptional instance, the words or letters given within square brackets are not in the usual sense conjectural: they are not visible on Plate 95 at all but are borrowed from the identical text on Plate 94 in order to indicate just where the words or letters that are here legible occur on the page.

But none of the usual techniques of magnification or photography yielded anything more than a half word or so (in the dark lines below the arm of the large drawing of Albion that fills this area), until I noticed that the open spaces that were white in the photostatic positive (enlarged) were not solidly dark in the enlarged negative but filled with shadowy images of words, quite legible in the right light. "Derbyshire" was a word that quickly led to conjecture that the text was related to the Cornwall &amp; Derbyshire passage on Plate 94. Comparison of the two pages, line by line, yielded the evidence presented above. The legible words or letters are in relatively the same positions on Plate 95 as on 94, though not an exact retracing. For example, on 95 the first s of "restless" is above the final e of "Female" in the next line and the final e of "Derbyshire" in the next; on 94 the s is above the m of "Female" though still above the final e of "Derbyshire". In Plate 94 a paragraphic space is inserted between lines 4 and 5 which was not present in Plate 95; and so on. In all the fairly well recovered lines it is evident that the slight variations in position are accounted for by variations in spacing, not changes in text. The fit is so nearly exact throughout that the probability of unfound variants in the larger unrecovered portions is almost completely ruled out, except for the possibility that line 27 is new on Plate 94. There is room for it on 95 but no visible trace. In meaning it is parenthetical; it may well have been written when the passage was moved. Below the canceled text is a canceled illustration which is practically identical to the lower two-thirds of the bottom picture on Plate 94. The new picture, of young Albion rising in anger with wrath "bright flaming on all sides around", is etched on top of the old, his flames and left leg and right foot being drawn on top of the original lines representing "Brittannia" lying upon the bosom of aged Albion, asleep or dead. Only traces of Brittannia remain, remnants of her legs above the man's; but the legs of aged Albion were only slightly cut into when Blake cut the row of flames on the right side. On the left side he scraped away most of the man's head but left three fragments, including part of an eye, now serving as crevices in a pile of rocks (consolidated into one in the colored copy). From the condition of the plate, as revealed in the posthumous copies, it is easy to suppose that Blake did not expect his earlier picture to show at all. In the British Museum copy grey wash disguises legs and feet. In the Harvard copy he added lines to increase the rock-pile effect and efface the head; in none of the uncolored copies are there positive indications that the remnant calves of Brittannia and calves and feet of old Albion are meant to be taken as part of the picture. Yet perhaps (though his text does not directly suggest it) Blake did mean to have us see what the compilers of the Census discern: "flames, which appear to be consuming a body of which only the legs and feet are seen on the right and the head, vaguely, on the left" (p. 110). For in the colored (Mellon) copy, where he might have covered all, Blake has resurrected the aged corpse (while covering the remnants of Brittannia) and given it a good head and legs: young Albion firmly elevates himself with one foot on the thigh of the old. Furthermore Blake has painted out the heavy lines on the plate which separated the young man's buttocks from the flames between his legs and has changed the flames into a sort of triple tail or threefold fleshy garment extending downward as part of the young man's back. Also in the colored copy is added, with india ink and spots of white, what the Census describes as "a worm at the lower margin." But there is only one state of the plate. If, as seems likely, Blake was dealing with an already finished plate (possibly the right side of the plate from the wrong side of which Plate 56 was printed: see comment above), he must have had to apply a ground to the whole plate, letting it fully cover the lower half (which he wished to retain) while he cut and etched his new picture in the top half, on top of the old picture and the text he was removing. It must then be supposed that he etched the whites so deeply that he could almost completely avoid inking the remnants of text in the hollows of his picture — or, it may be that the shadowy letters brought out by photography represent impressions made in the paper by the acid-reduced and un-inked letters which still retained relative elevation. This explanation would account for the appearance of the lines of the body of old Albion and of some letters in the thick lines of flame or body not touched by the second etching. 33 Plate 96 The peculiar arrangement of this page, the only one in Jerusalem in which Blake's fourteeners are doubled back on themselves to make room for a picture, can be accounted for by an earlier use of the plate. Elsewhere the pictures accommodate themselves to the shape of the text, but here the shape of the picture, belling out oddly at its base to no apparent purpose, has been determined by the shape of earlier engraving on the plate, I find. There is a good deal of submerged cross-hatching in the area below the center of the picture and along its left side near the text, the only distinguishable form being a perspective drawing of what looks like a small Grecian temple. From the top to the center of the picture some 7 irregularly spaced lines of cursive italic writing are fragmentarily visible as white loops across the thick outlines of Blake's drawing. In the Rosenbloom copy the first words are decipherable as "The greatest". These prove to be the first words, in the same cursive engraver's lettering, of a commercial manifesto in the center of a large poster etched by Blake for "Moore &amp; Co's Manufactory &amp; Warehouse of Carpeting and Hosiery, Chiswell Street, Moor-fields" (reproduced as Plate 10 in Keynes's book of William Blake's Engravings: The Separate Plates , 1956). 34 The Grecian temple turns out to be the roof and walls of a "Common Carpet Loom"; the belling out of the Jerusalem picture is necessitated by the shape of the base of one of the large pillars that flank the "Carpeting and Hosiery" advertisement. Jerusalem 96 is etched on a piece of copper cut from the lower left quarter (roughly speaking) of the plate. 35 The visible seven lines are the beginnings of seven of the lines in the announcement of carpets and stockings for sale to private families and to merchants: The greatest variety . . . &amp; Kidderminster . . . [ A short line here, not visible ] Private Families . . . Worsted, and Thread . . . [ Another short line ] Colours &amp; patterns . . . the Purchaser . . . [ A short line ] Merchants . . . The original design, with sun-lit royal crests above, carpet-hung pillars, and "innocent" sketches of sons and daughters of Albion spinning, rolling carpets, and laboring at three sorts of looms — Common, Persia &amp; Turkey Carpet, and Stocking Frame — may be thought of as the commercial contrary to Blake's painting of Hervey's Meditations , or the innocent contrary to "Nelson guiding Leviathan." How appropriate to etch upon it the picture of Albion regenerated and "England who is Brittannia" rejoicing, the climactic page of Jerusalem in which "all the Cities of Albion" rise from their slumbers. Too bad it was necessary to obliterate at the bottom the adaptation from Martial which Blake had inscribed for Moore &amp; Co., if he had not suggested it to them: Hæc tibi Londini tellus dat munera: victa est Pectine Britannico jam Babylonis acus. — which is to say, the world of London makes you this gift: now the loomfork of Britain has conquered Babylon's needle. Plate 98 . . . .

"Two", imperfectly mended in the copper to "Three" in line 11, was doubtless a mistake of copying (note the dropped syllable earlier in the line). 36 There is an uncrossed t in line 13 (in "this"). The last words in line 33 are so crowded that "Non Ens" becomes almost a single word, "NonEns". In line 34 Blake laboriously mended "regenations" by changing "e" to "a" and "t" to "r" and eking out the parts of "ions" to make "ations". And a crowding occurred in line 48 that drove the final s of "Sacrifices" into the ornamental border; though it is clearly visible only in the Harvard copy, I take this to be a false deletion since the context demands the plural. An extremely curious double revision occurs in line 45. What Blake originally etched on the plate was "thy Covenant Jehovah". But then he made "thy" into "the" by cutting away the long stroke (still very faintly visible in all copies) and mended the word "Covenant" into "Coventof" to achieve the reading "the Coven[an]t of Jehovah". The mending is far from perfect, possibly from technical rather than textual inattention; yet in the latest copy, the Morgan, Blake used india ink to restore the original reading, "thy Covenant Jehovah". Now either reading will work in the passage, although "the Covenant of Jehovah" is what the context most obviously suggests. In so hasty a page, the original "thy" may have been a mistake, the mending of the plate a correction to the wording intended. Oddly, however, in no copies did Blake repair his imperfectly mended word "Covent" by inserting "an" or "na" above it and a caret below, as was his usual practice in such cases. In the only copy in which he attended to the imperfection, he restored instead the original though presumably accidental reading—possibly because he recognized that it would work textually. His not perfecting the other copies does rather argue that Blake was not strongly attracted to the reading "the Covenant of". Compare the case of Plate 69. In each instance, the only time he attends carefully to his partly mended text he restores a reading that preceded the mending. The case of the restoration on Plate 37 of the original word "blue", in the British Museum copy, is slightly different since the printing of later copies of this plate does not leave any ambiguity about the reading of the revision to "pale". Plate 99 Beneath the picture that occupies most of this plate may be seen relics of some earlier use. Turned the other way around, the plate contains large architectural elements in the foreground and what may be a title, perhaps unfinished but thick with engraved swirls of wings or bows or large looped capitals — or all these together. It is not the pattern of the present title page of Jerusalem but seems somewhat in its spirit. There is only one state of this plate, though variations are made in the colored and retouched copies. In the Harvard, Mellon, and Morgan copies the hands of Jehovah — or of "that God from whom all books are given", to quote the restored Plate 3 — are redrawn, concealing the small oblong that looks something like a small bible or psalm-book held between the thumb and second finger of his left hand, with his forefinger inserted between the pages. A black wash covers it in the British Museum copy. It is fairly visible in the Rinder facsimile. But this is perhaps a wrong construction. Plate 100 That a thick thread, passing from the distaff to the woman's right hand, is "seen only in" the Mellon copy ( Census , p. 110) does not signify a variant state of the plate. In the color facsimile the orange thread appears as an integral part of the plate. But in the original we can see that the whole area was printed an even color and that the thread was created, on this copy, by addition of a black wash (making a corridor of the light brown print, for the thread) and reddish orange streaks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusions as to the Sequence of Copies Although some of the apparent evidence for the relative order of copies of Jerusalem put forward in the Keynes and Wolf Census of 1953 does not stand up under scrutiny, that order itself is, in the main, confirmed by the bits of evidence that emerge. A shuffling of folio numbers in Chapter 3 of the British Museum copy (numbers 54-66 being written over erasures) is not repeated in other (hence presumably later) copies. If priority in a single plate were sufficient evidence for priority of an entire copy, the state of the mending on Plate 20 would prove the British Museum and Rinder copies to be earlier than the other three complete copies. But the watermark evidence, in conjunction with the Linnell receipt of a completed Chapter 2 in December, 1819 (see note 8), indicates that Chapters 1 and 2 of both these copies, and the Cunliffe copy of Chapter 1 — all on 1818 paper — were printed more or less simultaneously and before any copies of Chapters 3 and 4. These final chapters of the British Museum copy (at least) were apparently printed before the Harvard and Mellon copies, however, since they contain paper of 1818 and 1819 as well as 1820, while the latter contain only 1820 paper. Nothing indicates the relative positions of the Harvard and Mellon copies; the Census designation of these as copies D and E becomes an arbitrary matter. The watermarked paper of 1824 and 1826 in the Morgan copy remains the only specific evidence that it is the latest of the five. To return to the question of the order of plates in Chapter 2, the evidence is fairly conclusive that the supposedly "standard" order is neither the latest nor the earliest order established by Blake. It is found in the middle pair of copies, the Harvard and the Mellon, but in his latest copy, the Morgan, Blake returned to the order of his first two copies. The strongest argument for considering the variant order of the 1820 pair as Blake's final preference rests on his statement in a letter of 12 April 1827 about Jerusalem : "One I have Finished." The usual assumption is probably a sound one, that he was here referring to the one completely colored copy, the Mellon. It does not follow that he had not finished it some years earlier; he had it on hand because he could not "get a Customer for it." Moreover, concentrating on the illumination of that copy he may not have concerned himself greatly about the textual sequence — else why return to his original order for his most recently printed copy, the Morgan? Perhaps the soundest conclusion is that Blake found both sequences attractive but considered neither definitive. Evidence as to attention paid to the text itself, after printing, is perhaps too slight to be of much value in this connection. The unique restoration in the Mellon copy, of "conjoined" to "combined" (Plate 69), is more impressive than the Morgan copy revision of "worm" to "worms" (Plate 56). On the other hand the neglect of the imperfect mending on Plate 98 ("Coventof" for "Covenant of") except for the restoration of "thy Covenant" in the Morgan copy points the other way. Furthermore the retouching of rude mendings in other plates is carried through more conscientiously in the Morgan than in any other copy and rather less conscientiously in the Mellon than in any other. While it cannot be said that Blake seriously neglected the Mellon text even while devoting his greatest effort to the color and high finish of its illumination, I think that we are forced to conclude, from the treatment of weakly printing passages on Plates 22, 27, 29, 37, 40, 53, 61, 76, and 98, that Blake took more pains to make the text legible in the Morgan copy than in the Mellon. Finally, that he should take the pains to rearrange the plates or pages of Chapter 2 in his latest copy, to return to his earliest order after having tried an alternative arrangement in two copies, lends perhaps decisive weight to the conclusion that the text of the Morgan copy comes the closest to representing Blake's final preferences.

      <field name="fulltext">Note Mistaken report of the Morgan copy foliation (given earlier as "standard" but in Census as 1-28, 43-46, 29-37, 42, 38-41, 47-100, from a confusion of numerical equivalents) created a legend that there are three Blakean arrangements of plates, with the corollary that the "standard" order is that of "the majority of the copies" (Keynes, 1957, p. 981). To confuse matters further, a printer's error on the same page makes Keynes seem to declare that "the arrangement is constant except in one copy" (he meant to say "two"). Actually it is the variant order that is found in a majority of three of the available copies. The possibility that some of the scattered single plates — the four printed in green or some of the seven in black — may be remnants of another complete copy does not seem great. For one thing, none of these single leaves has any trace of the foliation, outside the plate, which Blake inscribed on the leaves of all finished copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Table of Catchwords Angle brackets signify deletion made in the copper; square brackets conjectural readings. No catchwords appear in the plates not listed here. In the Mellon copy the catchwords of Plates 5, 9, 12, 13, and 37 remain but in effect are deleted by loops, lines, or washes. That of Plate 13 is hidden also in the Morgan copy.

Plate 10 is an amplification of material on 9, which was once followed by 11. If "One" is a correct reading of the deleted word on 11, the plate originally following it must have been discarded. The deletion of "His" on 18, despite its present fit, signifies two moves — once to precede a plate that did not begin with this word, once to its present location. Thicker lettering also suggests that 18 was not etched in the same period as 17 and 19. But we also know that 19 was once differently numbered (see note on Numbering); and its deleted catchword shows that 19 was once followed by 23 (which itself once had a different number). Plates 20-22, however, do appear to be insertions in the present position, and we know that 20 was once numbered "16". From the evidence of catchwords and plate numbers, then, Chapter 1 shows most signs of rearrangement and supplementation after the first etching of plates. Little shifting seems to have occurred in Chapter 2 (but see note on Numbering) until after the printing of two copies. Several signs of earlier shifting turn up in Chapter 3. Plate 53 may once have been followed by 60 or 74: each of the latter begins on the same theme and one may have been made to replace the other and then in turn been moved ahead. Plate 66 was not designed for its present position; 70 must have been followed by a plate now discarded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sizes of Plates Measurements, in centimeters, were made from edge of impression to edge of impression at the widest point, of the plates in the Morgan copy of Jerusalem . Since some edges are uneven, another measuring might not give identical results; in other copies the actual impressions may vary by a millimeter or two either way. As measured, the plates of Jerusalem vary in size from 19.9 x 13.7 (Plate 56) to 22.5 x 16.4 (Plates 24 and 75). But 89 of the 100 plates fall into three discrete sizes. Exactly fifty cluster with slight variations around a size of 22.2 x 16.2; another 28 plates cluster around the size of 21 x 14.8 (somewhat more than a centimeter shorter and narrower than the first size); and 11 plates are in a size as long as the first but as narrow as the second. The remaining 11 plates are scattered in what appear to be five discrete sizes, larger or smaller than these three. Copper plates were poured into moulds and hardened and then hammered and beveled; for small sizes they were cut in half before beveling: the edges would vary from hammering, cutting, and beveling, but the discrete clusters of sizes found here seem to signify different moulds — or at least different batches of cuttings. The plates of America (early 1790's) run somewhat larger in both dimensions than those of Jerusalem , around 23.8 x 17 cm. The plates for Visions of the Daughters of Albion (of the same period) can be accounted for as halves of the same size. Halves of the Jerusalem size appear in the plates of Milton . If America and Jerusalem were productions that overlapped in the workshop, we would expect to find that some of the odd sizes in Jerusalem came from the batch used for America . But the sizes in Jerusalem (and Milton ) do not lie close to any of the sizes found in America and other early works. If the inference of discrete batches is correct, this evidence supports the usual assumption that there was a lapse of some time between the earlier Illuminated books and the beginnings of Milton and Jerusalem . Jerusalem at least (it is harder to tell about the half-plates of Milton ) does not appear to use any copper left over from the earlier works. It may also be inferred that Blake's economical practice of using backs and fronts of plates (there are several visible platemaker's marks in Europe ) had not left him any unused backs among the plates from which he continued to print copies of his Lambeth books. Of the 11 plates in five odd sizes, I find nothing very significant to say. Plates 71 and 77 are in the widest size (22 x 17, 21.9 x 16.8) — the latter plate for the good reason that it contains the widest matter in Jerusalem , pentameter lines in double column; the former for no obvious reason (can it be printed from the back of the same plate?). The narrowest plates, 56 (19.9 x 13.7) and 95 (20 x 13.6), may be early (on the basis of other evidence) but do not demonstrate earliness or lateness by their narrowness, for there is no early work by Blake with plates of these dimensions. Very probably the suspicion that plates of odd sizes may be intruders — early or late insertions — is mistaken. Plate 96, cut from the Moore &amp; Co. plate, is not textually an intruder.) More fruitful is the discovery that, when we abandon the grouping of roughly equivalent sizes and make a table of particular sizes, many are represented by two or four examples and many of these pairs or potential pairs are closely related in pagination and in appearance (style, lettering, thickness of varnish, or other qualities). Can anything be made of the hypothesis that two pages with plates of the same size may represent the two sides of a single plate? My measurements were too crude to be taken as proof of identical shapes even when identical — or to rule out such identity even when varying by a millimeter or so. Nor should we expect the two sides of a plate to have identical beveling and to make identical impressions. 37 Something other than chance distribution, however, appears to lie behind the following groupings. Here is a list of all sizes represented by two or more plates of Jerusalem . In parentheses I indicate which potential pairs seem "likely," i.e. closely related in content, script, or some other indication of vintage. An asterisk (*) denotes presence of platemaker's stamp, a certain but not always present indication of the back of a plate. 20.2 x 14.4 (pages 64* &amp; 96) (likely, and the pair of 96 would have to be the back of the plate; we would expect it to be used first) 20.8 x 14.8 (97 &amp; 98) (likely) 20.8 x 15 (86 &amp; 88) (unlikely, at least in lettering) 20.9 x 14.6 (54 &amp; 55) (likely) 20.9 x 14.7 (58 &amp; 81) (unlikely; 58 seems to pair more obviously with 57 [20.9 x 14.8]) 20.9 x 14.9 (36[32] &amp; 62 &amp; 84 &amp; 93) (possibly two pairs, though all four pages seem disparate: unlikely) 21 x 14.8 (69 &amp; 85) (likely) 21 x 14.9 (34[30] &amp; 67 &amp; 94) (the latter pair likely, the odd third not pairing easily with either) 21.1 x 14.8 (60 &amp; 91) (likely) 21.1 x 15 (15 &amp; 17 &amp; 22 &amp; 30[44] &amp; 44[39] &amp; 49) (likely pairs are: 15 &amp; 22, 30 &amp; 44) 21.8 x 15.9 (79 &amp; 80) (likely) 22 x 16 (8 &amp; 29[43] &amp; 43[38] &amp; 70 &amp; 82) (likely pair: 29 &amp; 43) 22.2 x 14.6 (10 &amp; 33[29]* &amp; 73) (likely pair: 10 &amp; 73) 22.2 x 16.1 (1 &amp; 20 &amp; 28 &amp; 31[45] &amp; 35[31] &amp; 42 &amp; 65 &amp; 66 &amp; 76) (likely pairs: 35 &amp; 42; 65 &amp; 66) 22.2 x 16.2 (4 &amp; 7 &amp; 26 &amp; 48 &amp; 53) (likely: 4 &amp; 7) 22.3 x 16.1 (18 &amp; 19 &amp; 23 &amp; 27 &amp; 37[33] &amp; 38[34] &amp; 46[41]) (likely pairs: 18 &amp; 19, 38 &amp; 46) 22.3 x 16.2 (3 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 12 &amp; 45[40]) (likely: 5 &amp; 6, 12 &amp; 45) 22.3 x 16.3 (14 &amp; 74) (not very likely, yet possibly same vintage) 22.4 x 16.1 (13 &amp; 40[36]) (likely) 22.4 x 16.2 (11 &amp; 50 &amp; 52) (any combination likely, but pagination favors 50 &amp; 52) 22.5 x 16.4 (24 &amp; 75) (likely) This table accounts for 73 pages and holds 33 possible pairs or 21 likely pairs (saving 47 &amp; 48 for the next list). It leaves 27 pages unaccounted for, each unique in its size, as now measured. But any of the nearly identical pages may be disguised pairs. The following table includes all such possible pairs (defined as within one millimeter of identity in either or both dimensions) which are also likely (but excluding the unlikely). 19.9 x 13.7 &amp; 20 x 13.6 (56* &amp; 95) (discussed above) 20 x 14.3 &amp; 21.1 x 14.4 (89 &amp; 92*) (likely) 20.9 x 14.8 &amp; 20.9 x 14.7 (57 &amp; 58) (likely) 20.8 x 15.9 &amp; 20.9 x 16 (47 &amp; 48) (likely) 22.2 x 14.7 &amp; 22.2 x 14.8 (59 &amp; 63*) (likely) (Proof that all likely pairs may not be actual pairs lies in the example of 72* &amp; 100*, which are very close in measurement — 22.3 x 14.7 &amp; 22.3 x 14.6 — but are both backs of plates.) Altogether we have found 26 likely (and possible) pairs, involving over half the pages in the book. How closely in sequence do the partners appear? Here is the list in sequent order: 4&amp;7 5&amp;6 10&amp;73 12&amp;45[40] 13&amp;40[36] 15&amp;22 18&amp;19 24&amp;75 29[43]&amp;43[38] 30[44]&amp;44[39] 35[31]&amp;42 38[34]&amp;46[41] 47&amp;48 50&amp;52 54&amp;55 56&amp;95 57&amp;58 59&amp;63 60&amp;91 64&amp;96 65&amp;66 67&amp;94 69&amp;85 79&amp;80 86&amp;88? 89&amp;92 97&amp;98 Note that in the Rinder order the pairs involving the second chapter would run: 12&amp;40 13&amp;36 31&amp;42 34&amp;41 38&amp;43 39&amp;44 47&amp;48 50&amp;52. (I fail to see why — is it only chance? — Plates 38 and 39 in this order, which are paired respectively with 43 and 44, become 43 and 44 in the Standard order!) In either order the plates of 8 of these pairs are adjacent; the plates of almost half (12 out of 26) are either adjacent or within three numbers of each other. Nor are most of the others distributed at random. The series 40 41 42 43 44 (in Rinder order) are (hypothetically) on the backs of another, more scattered series 12 31 34 38 39. (In the standard order the series 40 42 43 46 are on the backs of the series 13 29 34 38.) Further on there is another tight series 91 92 94 95 96 on the backs of a looser series 56 60 64 67 89. These patterns altogether account for 22 out of 26 pairs and seem to indicate something more than a chance distribution. The adjacent or straddling pairs (5&amp;6 4&amp;7, for instance) suggest a working from front to back at once or almost at once. The more scattered series suggest accumulations of one-sided plates all used on their backs at once (i.e. for plates 40 to 44 and 91 to 96). If we grant that these patterns may approximate the methods actually followed, can we make any meaningful deductions at this point? Perhaps not in isolation. But I suggest that further study of the textual and technical continuities and discontinuities in the plates of Jerusalem might benefit from attention to these potential pairings. Such odd couplings as 10&amp;73 and 24&amp;75 may provide clues to an earlier arrangement. Indeed one clue of this sort enters into the discussion, above, of Plates 56 and 95.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Blake's Numbering of the Plates In each copy of Jerusalem printed by Blake he numbered the leaves consecutively with pen and ink just above the top right edge of the printed plate. It is this foliation, after printing, that gives us the two different arrangements for Chapter 2 discussed above. Fragments of a more mysterious tale, however, are told by the numbers which Blake engraved in (or sometimes etched near) the top right corners of his plates. These were apparently made for his guidance (or a helper's guidance) before printing; they were engraved or etched so lightly that they were usually hidden by the inking of the plates; yet they show up, occasionally in a row of deleted and undeleted numerals, on nearly all the pages of one or more of the posthumously printed copies, being particularly legible in the Rosenbloom copy. In the British Museum copy only nine numbers are visible — and only one of these corresponds to the position of the plate in this or any known copy. Obviously Blake did not bring his numbering up to date before printing; quite possible most of the plates lacked numbering of any kind when he printed the British Museum and Rinder copies. (In the following discussion, "J" is used to desgnate the number of the plate in the "standard" Keynes arrangement, i.e. that of the Mellon and Harvard copies.) In the British Museum copy the title page, J2, is numbered "1" and the preface, J3, bears a deleted "2" (indicating a time when the frontispiece, J1, was not present or did not precede title and preface); J28, the first page of "Chap: 2", is numbered "1°" (possibly meaning "10", possibly from an incised "18" or "12" — in any case pointing to a time when the chapters were considerably shorter; J35 is numbered "31" (its actual position and folio number in this copy); J37 is "36" (a symptom of early rearrangement in this area, for its actual position and folio number are 33); J38[34] is numbered "6" (and superficially this plate looks as if it might originally have followed J5 — but see below); and J45[40] has two digits side by side, the first deleted, the second an undeleted "9" — probably one number replacing another, but just possibly a half-deleted two-digit number. (On J23 there also seems to be a trace of some deleted number.) Perhaps the "6" on J38 is worth discussion. This is one of a group of plates, J5, J38 ("6"), J7, J45 ("9"), and possibly J4 (first page of "Chap: 1"), which are very similar in design, in line, in general appearance, and are unlike other plates in the first half of Jerusalem . J6, lying between J5 and J7, is strikingly different in design and even in thickness of lettering — an obvious insertion. J38 ("6") looks as if it belonged here; it even meshes with the catchword on J5 ("His"). Yet its own catchword ("By") does not fit the top of J7; the fragmented sentences at the beginning and end of its text cannot possibly be spliced to the adjacent fragments of J5 and J7; moreover the text on J6 is so tightly related to the beginning of J7 that it must be a repetition or variant of some earlier canceled plate in this position. As for J45 ("9"), it does not link directly to any others in the group. In short, we lack sufficient evidence for a valid reconstruction even of a small segment of an early arrangement of Chapter 1. We can, however, see that the first etching of plates was followed by a good deal of shuffling and reorganization and substitution of new plates before Blake was ready to print the first extant copies. Plate numbers also apparently deriving from early stages of production are found on four of the Jerusalem pages in the small bundle of miscellaneous pages and proofs in the Rosenwald Collection. Here is another J38 numbered "6"; here are a J9 numbered "25" (or just possibly "23", as someone has penciled on the mounting paper), a J20 numbered "16" (a number deleted but visible in posthumous copies, beside the "20" that must have been added later), and a J50 numbered "19" (a number still visible and not apparently deleted in posthumous copies). Oddly Blake never changed or supplemented the "19" on Plate 50, which is marked "End of Chap: 2 d " (perhaps guide enough). It indicates that at one time the chapters were under ten pages in length. Perhaps the number of J28, first page of Chapter 2, was actually "10" (see above). At that rate the "XXVIII Chapters" would have made a book of about 250 plates. In the Cunliffe copy (Chapter 1) no numbers are visible. In the Rinder copy the only number to be made out from the facsimile is this same "1°" on J28 The Harvard and Mellon copies tell a different story. Before their printing Blake evidently numbered or renumbered all or nearly all his plates to conform to his current plan. Visible in one or the other of these copies, or in both, are numbers corresponding to the actual positions of J1-13, 16, 19-22, 25, 26, 28-32, 36, 38, 40-43, 47, 49, 52, 54-56, 58, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 68, 70, 72-74, 77-81, 84-86, 88, 90-93, 98. Some of these numerals were etched, possibly when the corner positions had already been occupied by engraved numbers now deleted: J52 (near center of page), 46, 56, 65, 68 (at end of line 2), 72 (end of line 11), 74 (half inch from corner). From the posthumous copies we can further deduce that at this time numbers indicating their current positions were given to J14, 15, 17, 18, 23, 24, 27, 33-35, 37, 39, 44, 48, 51, 53, 60, 62, 64, 66, 69, 71, 75, 76, 83, 89, 94, 96, 97, 99, 100. (In the Harvard copy the etched number on J75 looks very much like "77" and may possibly be another trace of earlier arrangement; yet the etched number in the same position that turns up in the Morgan and the Rosenbloom copies is "75".) This tally leaves only six unaccounted for. On J45[40] the "9" (or the two-digit number ending in "9") was never (visibly) replaced. In the Harvard copy the "46" on J46[41] is very lightly etched; it reappears as "45" in the Morgan and posthumous copies. J50 with its engraved "19" remained unchanged. J57 was probably correctly numbered; the "5" is visible in the Morgan copy, in a two-digit number. The same may be said of J82, an "8" being visible in the Morgan copy. J95, however, which we know began as 94, has no visible number in any copy. Since Blake numbered its replacement, J94, we cannot argue that the change was made after the time of numbering; indeed it was made before the earliest known copies. By this recount, all but two of the 100 plates seem likely to have had correct numbers for the printing of the Mellon and Harvard copies; more likely than not they all had. In the Mellon copy further indications of early shifting in Chapter 1 appear in traces of two earlier numbers. Beside the "18" on J18 there is a deleted number that looks like "12", though in the Morgan and Rosenbloom copies it looks more like "20". And on J26 there is a trace of a deleted number below the "26". No further numbering appears to have been done after the printing of the Mellon and Harvard copies — yet when he came to print the Morgan copy Blake did not simply disregard his numbers. It might be supposed that he simply printed — or had printed — a complete set of 100 leaves and then rearranged the second chapter before adding folio numbers (inscribed decisively but in the extremely shaky hand of illness or of age). But there are indications that he thought about his sequence and rearranged the copper plates before the printing. He did not renumber J29-41, 43-46, the plates that change position in Chapter 2. He did, however, scratch the "standard order" numbers on these plates, to delete them. The deletion marks are clearly visible on J31, 32, 33, and 41. The numbers on J30, 35, 40, 44 are too faintly printed to reveal scratch marks, but this faintness may be the result of scratching. And more thorough deletion would be a possible explanation for the invisibility of "standard" numbers on J45 and 46. All things considered, the final act of returning to his earlier order seems to have been as deliberate as the decision to depart from it had been. There remain to be noted three further instances of abandoned early numbers which show up on the posthumously printed plates. On J19 is a row of three numbers, "19", possibly "16", and "19" (apparently indicating a double move). On J23, beside "23", is a deleted number possibly "24". And on J37[33] beside the "37" there is a deletion that may be the "36" visible in the British Museum copy, there undeleted. Note: Blake's foliation of the Morgan copy is worth further remark. Little study has been made of the differences between what is called "forger's tremble" and the tremble of physical weakness. The reason the forger's hand trembles, however, is that his hand is not habituated to the style he is imitating; as he proceeds his trembling will decrease. The numbering of these pages shows a reverse symptom: the first numbers are inscribed with a bold confidence (for Blake's hand is indeed well trained in his own style), but a wave of weakness causes the "5" to waver and the "6" to tremble exceedingly; recovering, perhaps with a pause, the writer makes a steady 7, 8, 9, but trembles again on 10; again slightly on 13, greatly on 17, and so on. Waves of weakness seem to affect the writing, reaching subsequent peaks on 23, 29-30, 37-38, 47, 56-57, 63, 70, 76-77, 82, 87-88-89, 96-97. In this context, the signs of erasure and mending may point only to mistakes made in weakness. The "82", a very shaky numeral, was vaguely mended during inscription; there is similar mending and possible erasure in "38". But something more curious occurs in the first pages of Chapter 2. The "29" (on J33[29]) is written on top of an erased number, possibly a "33". The "30" (on J34[30]) is over an erasure, and 30, 31, 32 are in black ink but mended in gray ink, though the mending seems only a retracing without changes. Did prophet and spectre have one final wrestling over these twice-shifted pages? If so, the earlier Blake firmly won the victory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Dating of Blake's Script Blake's handwriting, of which we have large samples over a period of 43 years, exhibits some gradual modifications over the decades but would not be easy to arrange in a close chronological series from appearances alone. Milton scholars count themselves fortunate to have found one precisely datable change in their author's handwriting, his discarding the Grecian for the Italian e in the course of the writing of Lycidas . No similar conscious or unconscious change of a letter-style has yet been found in the manuscripts of Blake. Blake's public script, however, is another matter. The lettering of his Illuminated Books and of his etched or engraved inscriptions differs from his handwriting not only in appearance but in the fact that it is a product of deliberate art and comprises several deliberately chosen varieties and changes of style. For formal inscriptions Blake early learned both a flowing engraver's cursive script and a simple upright roman letter. In his first experiments in Illuminated Printing he employed both of these plus a more efficient italic script, print-like and only slightly cursive. This simple italic became the staple of his subsequent text style, varied more or less subtly on different occasions and sometimes combined with the simple roman. In the period 1790-1795 he tried several interesting modifications of his standard alphabet. Several variant letter-forms, various flagged h 's, an f with an extra serif at the top, and certain contrived variants in the descenders, can be seen to spring up, flourish, and then suffer gradual neglect. But nearly every one of these reappears from time to time as a graceful variant in later texts. Its presence or absence in an undated plate is extremely difficult to assess as evidence of period, although it may be useful to distinguish certain trends. One striking exception, however, is found in a letter-form that Blake invented in about 1791, employed with unwavering consistency for fourteen years, and then as suddenly and with ruthless consistency discarded. This is an italic small g with its serif or topknot on the left side instead of the right. The conventional g may be seen throughout the Songs of Innocence (1789), alternating occasionally with a sort of manuscript g that has no proper serif; the left-turned g appears throughout the Songs of Experience (dated 1794 but etched, there is now reason to see, 1791-94), except for those songs originally etched among those of Innocence. The date of adoption can be narrowed by noting the overlap of Thel and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Thel , dated 1789 but containing (as others have observed) a Motto and a concluding plate that seem late additions, uses the conventional and manuscript g 's — except in the Motto and last plate, where the new g takes over. The Marriage is dated 1790 by internal and marginal evidence on its third plate but was the product of several years. The old g rules up through Plate 5 and in Plates 11-13 and 21-24; the new g in 6-10, 14-20, and in the "Song of Liberty" (25-27). This overlap narrows the date of change to late 1790 or early 1791. Every serifed g thereafter points leftward, even in inscriptions made for Cumberland or Hayley, including the inscription "June 18, 1805 . . . Bridge Street" in the plates for Hayley's Ballads . After that date Blake not only abandoned the leftward g but corrected it in reissues! In the 1807 reissue of these Ballads the date is not changed, but the g in "Bridge Street" has a new rightward serif. Blake's Gates of Paradise , etched "For Children" in 1793, with leftward g 's, was reissued many years later with some further etching, during which the g 's were given new, right-facing serifs, opposite visible remnants of the old. In late issues of Songs of Experience , for example in the Rosenwald and Fitzwilliam copies, which may be seen in facsimile and microfilm, when Blake retouched the lettering he added new serifs beside the old. Even the g in the large title of "The Tyger" has two large serifs like horns. Going over the text of "The Angel" in gold, he put two golden serifs on each g , this time respecting both serifs — perhaps absently, perhaps with some amusement at his own device. Blake thus, for whatever reason, left us a distinctive chronological zone marked by two precise termini. After two years of searching I have found no exceptions in any of his work the dating of which is founded on more than conjecture. There are a few single plates with conventional g 's which have traditionally — but more or less arbitrarily — been assigned to the middle period (1791-1805). Some of these are rather obviously mis-assigned. The etched "A Divine Image", a rejected Song of Experience, has been collected after the Songs as an "additional poem" and dated 1794 but purely as a convenience. It fits much more plausibly ahead of the published Songs of Experience , as a trial Song etched in 1790 but supplanted by the subtler "The Human Image" before the final collection was assembled. (See Robert F. Gleckner, "William Blake and the Human Abstract," PMLA, lxxvi (1961), 373-379, for a reasoned plea for an early date in the absence of "real evidence to the contrary.") A more difficult exception is "To Tirzah" (with conventional g 's) which has always been recognized as a late addition to the Songs of Experience but given a variety of conjectural dates. In his text Keynes puts it "Probably . . . about 1801" (p. 220); but in the Census (p. 55) four copies of Songs containing "To Tirzah" (F,I,J,K) are assigned to 1795-98 and four (L,M,N,O) to 1799-1801. Moving the dates of these eight copies after June 1805 will play hob with the Census table of copies A to CC, but it is time to realize that this is only a table of convenience resting largely on impressionistic evidence and, in its few points of apparent data, full of self-contradiction. Copy L is said to be inscribed with "the initials JS, dated 1799," but the initials (a kind of doodle at the bottom of the page) and the "date" (at the top) are in pencil; moreover the date is written "1799-", the hyphen indicating that this is an owner's or bookseller's suggested terminus ab quo . Copy O has an ink inscription "Mrs. Flaxman April 1817" yet is assigned to 1800 because the order of arrangement of the songs "suggests a date of about" that year — an argument resting upon circles within circles. Actually copies P (on "1802" paper) and Q (on paper dated 1802 and 1804) are the first "To Tirzah" copies with tangible termini ab quo : their dates could easily be after 1805. I believe the only other exception is the inscription on "Albion rose". Sir Geoffrey may be right in supposing that the color-printed copies, in which the inscription is not visible, were made in about 1794. But the conventional g in "Giving" plus the symbolism in "the dance of eternal death" (which belongs in the Milton period) now put the inscription after 1805, for the symbolism rules out 1790. Certainly none of these apparent exceptions bears any weight of evidence against the rule of g . As for Milton and Jerusalem , unfortunately the title pages, dated "1804", contain no lower-case g 's. The plates of text, however, employ exclusively the conventional post-1805 g and I think cannot safely be dated earlier. This at least rules out the whimsical hypothesis I once entertained that certain curiously different plates inserted in the two later copies of Milton might be relics of a very early version. At least they cannot have been inscribed very early. Postscript: In the British Museum there are proofs of Plates 5 and 53 back to back on one leaf, both similarly colored in a variety of opaque and translucent colors including blue, yellow, and red. Just possibly these are not proofs but two pages of a lost copy. J53 is of course headed "Chap: 3", but J5 is rather close in subject and may once have been the second page of that chapter. The facsimile of the Rinder copy proves faithful to the original, now examined through the courtesy of its owner. But the caret and insert on Pl. 61 are visible; and besides the "1°" on 28, two other incised numerals can be read—a "7" (of "37"?) on 39[35] and a "1" (of "100"?) on 100. Added blacking of borders prevents discovery of other numerals that may have been on the plates. Folio numbers show some erasure and change, this time in Chap. 1 (15, 16, 17 may have been 16, 17, 18; 19 is changed; 21 may have been 15 or 18; 11 was first in the 20's). Elsewhere only 97 is over erasure, probably 98. A real surprise comes in the watermarks, for the distribution given above (note 8) proves mistaken. Blake could have delivered Chap. 2 to Linnell in 1819—its dated leaves are ff. 29, 40, 42, 47, 49 (1818) —but not the present Chap. 1, which has 1819 paper in f. 19 and 1820 paper in ff. 11 and 16, besides the expected 1818 in ff. 3, 7, 22, 24, 25. (Note that 11, 16, and 19 are among those with changed folios: all possibly inserted as replacements in a delivered copy if not in a copy held for better pages.) Dates in the last chapters are as expected, though later than those in the British Museum copy: Chap. 3—f. 59 (1819), ff. 51, 60, 66, 68, 72, 73 (1820); Chap. 4—ff. 84, 88, 91, 93 (1820). I have now examined the separate print of Plate 51 which is in Sir Geoffrey Keynes' collection and can see that the names said to be printed in "white line" were added after the printing of the plate but not in white ink; they were cut into the thick ink on the paper with a sharp tool.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I have now examined all known copies and separate proofs of Jerusalem , as listed below and with the exceptions noted, and have made photographic collation of the difficult plates. My debt to all the collectors, curators, photographers, and Blake scholars who have assisted in this collation is infinite and my gratitude is infinite. As also to the American Council of Learned Societies for a grant in aid. For permission to publish photographs of their copies of Jerusalem I wish to thank the Trustees of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Mr. Charles J. Rosenbloom, and Mr. Lessing J. Rosenwald and the Library of Congress. It seems advisable in the present report to refer to copies of Jerusalem by their present locations rather than by the letters employed, with some ambiguity, in Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf 2nd, William Blake's Illuminated Books: A Census (1953). Though valuable in much of its detail, this revision of earlier lists by Keynes in his Bibliography of 1921 and Blake Studies of 1949 does not always follow, in its notes on individual plates, the new enumeration tabulated on pp. 113-114. Moreover it gives a mistaken foliation for one of the copies of Jerusalem . (For a corrected List of Copies, see below.) 2 Professor Karl Kiralis long ago called my attention to the presence of variant numbers on some of the plates and to discrepancies in descriptions of the order of plates in different copies. Throughout the preparation of this paper, he has been unstinting of his critical assistance. 3 The Complete Writings of William Blake with all the variant readings , ed. Geoffrey Keynes (Nonesuch Press, 1957), p. 621. (Herein cited simply as Keynes.) 4 A strong magnifying glass helps to keep the work in focus. Enlargement by three diameters sometimes facilitates progress; further magnification proves of no service. Photographs are not appreciably better than photostats for the kind of deletions here examined, but for the recovery of erased or palimpsest mss. photography is more helpful, infrared photography most helpful. High contrast paper is less satisfactory than the regular glossy photostatic paper in which shadings and shadows of letters are retained. Only such paper captured the ghost letters on Plate 95. 5 A. C. Swinburne, Essay on Blake (1866), p. 284; S. Foster Damon, William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols (1924), p. 434. The British Museum copy has some crumbs of letters throughout Plate 3 but of a most discouraging faintness. 6 These methods are also applicable to handwriting, with some adjustment. The uniformities of shape and spacing are less precise but still present, even in such cramped inscriptions as Blake's marginalia. Photographic enlargement plus magnifying glass bring many an apparently lost passage up to legibility. An appendix of recovered deletions, in the prose as well as the poetry, will be given in the Blake Concordance which is under preparation for the concordance series of Cornell University Press. 7 The exact particulars of Blake's methods of printing are unknown, but the hypotheses of Ruthven Todd, tested experimentally in the workshop of Stanley William Hayter, supply a convincing reconstruction. (See Ruthven Todd, "The Techniques of William Blake's Illuminated P[r]inting," Print , VI (1948), No. 1, pp. 53-65; the title is misprinted "Painting".) One fragment of copper alone survives from all Blake's Illuminated Printing, a piece cut from a discarded plate for page 5 of America , now in the Rosenwald Collection. The plate and a proof of it are shown in Todd's article, p. 57, but captions referring to the "worn condition of the plate" are quite mistaken. No plates of Blake's were so much used as to become worn; moreover this plate was discarded before use: the blurring of letters in a print made from it is due to the imperfect original etching, the varnish or ground having oozed between the strokes of the letters in such a way that the acid did not cut a clear outline. 7a Professor John Grant, in correspondence, points out that "28 chapters is 'the same' as 4 or 100 in symbolic arithmetic: i.e. it equals apocalypse." 8 No known copy of Milton was printed before 1808, no known copy of Jerusalem before 1818-1820 (according to watermark evidence). The title-page dates mean that Blake had at least planned these two epics by 1804. Just possibly he etched the title pages at that time; yet none of the pages of text (including the Jerusalem frontispiece) can have been inscribed or etched before the middle of 1805 (see note below on Dating of Blake's Script). He may have written Milton by this time; in letters of April and July, 1803, he declares that he has in the previous "three years composed an immense number of verses" descriptive of his "Spiritual Acts" of those three years — an account which fits Milton better than Vala or Jerusalem — and that these verses are already "perfectly completed into a Grand Poem" waiting only to "be progressively Printed &amp; Ornamented with Prints &amp; given to the Public." Possibly the title pages of "1804" mark a division of the grand poem into two. Biographical and historical allusions in Jerusalem , however, range in date from 1804 to 1814 or 1815 (the end of the war) and suggest a much later date of composition for most of that poem. By the end of 1805 Blake was caught up in Cromek's schemes, to the neglect of his epics, and by the time he and Cromek separated Blake's attention must have been absorbed by preparations for the extremely ambitious Exhibition of 1809. In that exhibition's Descriptive Catalogue (of which the printing had begun by 19 Dec. 1808; see below) he announces that he has "written" and will, if encouraged (the language is close to that of his 1803 letters), "publish" a "voluminous" work that sounds more like Jerusalem than Milton . He had evidently not yet etched or "Printed &amp; Ornamented" many of the plates, if any, or his announcement would be of copies for sale. At this point there is a very important document in which Blake asserts that he has not done any Illuminated Printing for a long time and is not free to do any in the foreseeable future. George Cumberland had written to Blake on 18 Dec. 1808 (Keynes, Letters , p. 171) with news that he had a customer for "a compleat set of all you have published in the way of Books" of colored "etchings" (i.e. in Illuminated Printing). The significance of Blake's reply, 19 Dec. (Keynes p. 865) has been overlooked because of a mistranscription of "printing" as "painting" in the first sentence: "I am very much obliged by your kind ardour in my cause, &amp; should immediately Engage in reviving my former pursuits of printing if I had not now so long been turned out of the old channel into a new one, that it is impossible for me to return to it without destroying my present course." (B.M. Add. MSS 36501, f. 314) He goes on to indicate that preparations for his coming Exhibition "preclude all possibility of promising any thing." His time is taken up with the (conventionally) printed Descriptive Catalogue , which he calls "an account of my various Inventions in Art". (Some mystery has been made about this reference, from taking "Inventions" in a wrong sense, but Blake is using the very language of his Catalogue title: ". . . Poetical and Historical Inventions, painted by WILLIAM BLAKE. . . ".) And his time "in future must alone be devoted to Designing &amp; Painting"; there were 16 ambitious painted Inventions which must be ready by the opening of the Exhibit in May, 1809, and he was also painting for Thomas Butts. The printing of the Catalogue had already begun, he said. It is difficult to know whether Blake's "so long" should be measured in months or years. He cannot have meant that he had done no Illuminated Printing since the Prophecies dated "1795", however, for he had more recently told Cumberland something about printing "60 plates of a new prophecy"—according to a memorandum in a Cumberland notebook of 1807, as reported to me by Professor G. E. Bentley, Jr. Bentley points out that the news may not have been very recent, since Cumberland at the same time refers to Blake's designs for Gray as new, though they existed perhaps as early as September, 1800, and certainly before September, 1805. (See Bentley's "Blake's Engravings and his Friendship with Flaxman," Studies in Bibliography , XII, 1959, 184.) Evidently the "voluminous" work announced in the Catalogue (see above) had been carried as far as 60 plates, in plan at least, before Blake's complete absorption in the Cromekian schemes. Can 60 plates have been actually etched and printed from by 1806 or 1807? The only possible relics, if so, would be the three Jerusalem proofs on 1802 paper; yet Blake's own later allusions will hardly bear this construction. At any event, when, after the failure of the Exhibition, he did return to his old channel, he must first have turned his attention to the etching and printing of Milton , for it is to this work that he alludes in his "Public Address" (paragraphs written in his notebook not earlier than 1810) as "a Poem . . . which I will soon Publish" (Keynes, p. 592). This implies a more advanced stage of production than the Catalogue allusion to Jerusalem . Milton is a more modest undertaking — the plates being fewer than half the number and only half the size of those for Jerusalem — and several things including the date of paper indicate that he finished Milton first; even the latest copies use paper with no later date than 1815. By that time Blake may have begun etching his plates for Jerusalem ; he began printing in 1818; by "30 Decembr 1819" he had delivered to Linnell (and received payment for) "Jerusalem Chap 2" of what is now the Rinder copy; presumably he had earlier delivered Chapter 1: both are on 1818 paper; the next two chapters use some 1820 paper; this dated receipt forces us to assume that the paper was used close to the time of its dates ( Letters , p. 183). The British Museum copy was evidently printed more or less simultaneously, for it too was begun on 1818 paper and completed on 1819 and 1820 paper. The first two chapters use only 1818 paper, but the third and fourth are on a combination of papers. The distribution, kindly checked for me by Professor E. E. Bostetter, is: Chap. 1—ff. 2, 3, 5, 9, 21, 22, 25 (1818); Chap. 2—ff. 27, 32, 38, 41, 44, 47, 48 (1818); Chap. 3—ff. 53, 62, 66, 72 (1818), ff. 58, 69, 71, 74 (1820); Chap. 4—ff. 78, 88 (1818), f. 76 (1819), ff. 82, 89 (1820). The Cunliffe copy (Chap. 1 only) must have been printed before the later chapters of any copies (whichever state Plate 20 may be), since it is on 1818 paper. It may or may not be an indication of the work's nearing completion that Thomas Waineright was able to describe Jerusalem in the September 1820 London Magazine as "an eighty-eight pounder" now "casting" and about ready to "fire off." Yet the fact that the next two copies are also on 1820 paper suggests that they were begun in or soon after that year. This leaves 9 or 10 years after 1809 for revising and rearranging both before and during what must have been a protracted period of etching. Things pointing to a long period of etching include the deletions and changes dealt with in this article, the trial arrangements of etched plates noted below in the discussion of the Numbering of the Plates, the great variety in such details as thickness of varnish, steadiness of line, handling of paragraph indention, quality of etching and engraving, and other matters hardly to be attributed to symbolic or aesthetic intention. The only other Illuminated work at all approaching this amount of technical variation is Songs of Experience , a work which was a minimum of three years in the etching (to judge from the etched but rejected "A Divine Image", a plate inscribed in 1790-91 according to the evidence of the script). 9 Printed on blank side of a proof of the title page of Europe ; first described in Blake Studies , pp. 110-113. But Sir Geoffrey may be mistaken in deducing that line 8 is "erased after the printing of the plate, leaving a white narrow space," for the same erasure appears in posthumous copies, where one can see that the space is white because the erasure, made on the plate before printing, was gouged too deep to take the ink. Yet Blake may have made his deletion doubly sure by erasing the paper as well. Deletion in the plate plus erasure of the paper is found in some copies of the Book of Urizen . 10 [ A Commentary on ] William Blake's Jerusalem (William Blake Trust, 1953), p. 103. (Cited without page when the reference can be found by plate number.) 11 A conjectural reading of Milton , Plate 10, line 6, severely deleted, would be: "Thus Space ?becomes ?Serpent-Formd &amp; the Womb ?Englobes". The queried words are quite uncertain, but context requires the line to deal with "the nature of a Female Space". 12 For the monumental plans Blake was interested in, see his letters of March and April. Of the four known copies of Milton , it is the two earlier that read "in 2 Books" and the two later "in 12", the reverse of what we might have expected. Nor can we suppose that Blake merely neglected in his later copies to cover the first digit. In copy C (in The New York Public Library) his brush and spatter work on the title page brings the "1" of "12" into prominent relief in a way that cannot be accidental. Even as he puts finishing touches on a copy in 2 books, he reaffirms his original goal of 12. Yet "Finis" on the last page of Chapter 2 is part of the original etching. 13 Wicksteed (p. 113) notes that the words "Sheep" and "Goats" are "engraved directly on the copper . . . a device very rarely resorted to . . . ." Failing to observe that it was technically necessary for Blake to resort to engraving when making an addition after etching, Wicksteed takes the rarity as celestial and finds that these words "suggest a Last Judgment scene with the Saviour seated above the Title but unseen." 14 I hesitate, however, to press the theory that Blake came to feel about Jerusalem the way Coleridge told Mrs. Barbauld he felt about the Ancient Mariner . 15 Keynes (p. 635) reads it "end of chap. I" and so do D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis, eds., The Prophetic Writings of William Blake (1926) I, 469. 16 The facial expressions vary somewhat with inking; in the Morgan copy the woman's face is whitened slightly with a thin grey wash. In the Mellon copy ringlets of brown hair (of about the same degree of curl as that on the woman's head) have been added between the bodies; a different, more golden tint has been given to the tassel-like inflorescence on either side — which Damon identifies as a symbolic "golden net." 17 When two plate numbers are given, the first is that of the "standard" order (Harvard and Mellon copies), the second, in brackets, is that of the order found in the other three copies. 18 The phrase is not "Albion coverd", the last words on Plate 30[44], as might have been the case were that plate an insertion. But some variant it may be: "Albion hid" looks feasible — i.e. "hid his heaven with clouds", a meaning that would fit the top of Plate 31[45]. 19 Sloss and Wallis (1, 509) observe: "Page 35 interrupts the sequence of pp. 34 and 36. It is either interpolated or misplaced: no better place can be suggested." Late insertion in a given position does not, however, need to mean late composition. 20 Meaning engraved instead of etched? If we call Blake's etched plate a stereotype (as he himself did in the colophon to The Ghost of Abel ), we ought to apply the same term to his etched and engraved plate, still a single unit of metal, one of his "types". 21 In the first part of the line he was trying to simulate his usual relief etching (e.g. the rest of the plate). He may have transferred his line of text to the copper in somewhat the usual way (though not in varnish), but he then had to cut it out unusually. 22 The ascenders added to the copper to make "pa" into "bl" have not been erased, but the letters "pal" have been restored by pen and ink. The restoration does not, however, obscure the evidence of the earlier mending of the plate from "pale" to "blue". Wicksteed (citing Max Ployman's note in the Everyman edition, p. 198) tells only half the story-and permits the mistaken supposition of a variant plate-when he describes this copy as simply "altered in ink" from "blue" to "pale". 23 Karl Kiralis notes that in the Mellon copy the text of this page is washed in blue (I would call it slate grey), suggests that blue may represent the creative spirit, and wonders whether Albion's soul may be leaving his body, according to a 17th-century supposition, through his feet. 24 This page in the Morgan copy is labeled "from another copy" and is on a narrower and shorter leaf (6 mm. narrower, and sloping from 5 to 10 mm. shorter, than the adjacent leaves). It is foliated, by Blake, "36". Does this mean that there was still another copy of Jerusalem , in the non-standard order and of the same late vintage as the Morgan copy? (The watermark of the page is 1826 .) Or did this leaf only return to the copy from which it had accidentally been separated? 25 See Blake: Prophet Against Empire (1954), pp. 440-444. Wicksteed (pp. 178-179, 184) on grounds I cannot fathom supposes an allusion in this plate to Blake's own Job illustrations of 1825 — forgetting for the moment that the plate is in all copies, let alone the 1802 proof. Yet at another moment (p. 178) he speaks of the latest plates as made by 1818, recalling the probable date Jerusalem began to be printed. 26 Professor Harold Bloom suggests that the inversions in Los's speech are meant as satiric mockery of the speech of the Daughters of Albion — i.e. that the difference is functional not chronological. 27 Keynes, pp. 778, 785. This may be a good place to put forward a revised reading of Blake's note on his 7th design in his Illustrations to Dante (Fogg Museum; collotype in Albert S. Roe, Blake's Illustrations to the Divine Comedy , 1953). A misreading of "Memory" as "Mistress" and failure to read the word "Imagination" distorts the emphasis in present readings. Blake first wrote: "Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical / Purposes he has made This World the Foundation/ of All &amp; the Goddess Nature &amp; not the Holy Ghost / as Poor Churchill / said Nature thou art / my Goddess". In Dante, that is, the Goddess of all is Nature rather than the Holy Ghost. Blake then put carets after "Nature" and "not" and wrote above the line the words "Memory" and "Imagination", to replace or explain "Nature" and "the Holy Ghost" respectively. Dante, he means, made the Goddess of all Memory rather than Imagination. But then he shifted the syntax, writing below the line the word "Nature" at the first caret and "is his Inspirer" at the second caret — but then crossing out "Nature" because the word already stood in his original line. If we follow carets and guide-lines for the final reading, we must stop after "of All" and make a new clause thus: "&amp; the Goddess Nature, Memory, is his Inspirer, and not Imagination, the Holy Ghost." (The Churchill clause, written alongside, may not have been added until this revision was completed.) 28 The Census ambiguously reports that the names "in incised lettering can be seen in copies A, B, and E" and that "fruits are hanging on the branches" in D and E. But in the Census code, copy B is the Cunliffe copy, which stops at the 25th plate. The code must be that of the 1921 Bibliography , where A is the Rinder, B the British Museum, D the Stirling (Mellon), and E the Morgan. Yet the statements are inexact for either code. In the 1921 code it should be said that both names appear in copy B, "Albion" only in A and E, the fruits in B, D, and E. In the Census code that both names appear in A, "Albion" only in C and F, the fruits in A, E, F. 29 Keynes, p. 726, gives correct readings of lines 48 and 67; he now has verified my readings of the other lines, from the Fitzwilliam copy. 30 A gap in the center of "weeping" in line 48 in the Rinder facsimile suggests that some damage was done there too, though the word prints fairly well in other copies. 31 Says Wicksteed (p. 228): "The critical significance of the story is revealed in two broken lines (47-8) and (66-7). In each case something has been deleted by Blake from his original text, but the underlying meaning is only emphasized by this breach of continuity." Which is perhaps only to say that we can follow the continuity despite the lacunae. 32 Wicksteed (p. 232) in a glancing phrase calls the deletion "a purposeful break" but gives no indication of what he means. 33 One curious detail is that the horizontal wavy lines in the hair of young Albion were drawn along the lines of text, perhaps to make certain that the words were concealed. 34 This commercial broadside must have been produced in 1797 or early 1798. Keynes hazards a date of 1790, but in London directories the firm name that fits the advertisement, "Moore &amp; Co. Carpet-warehouse, 45 Chiswell St", occurs only in 1797 and 1798. There are no later listings. Earlier variants, none of which would quite fit the engraved wording, are: "Moore, Foskett and Foskett, Hosier and Carpet-maker, Chiswell St" (1792-96), "Moore &amp; Fosketts, Hosier and Carpet-maker Chiswell St" (1789-91), and "Thos. Moore Hosier and Carpet-maker, 63 Chiswell St" or simply "Chiswell St" (1766-1788). We may guess that Blake's acquaintance with Moore &amp; Co, suppliers of hosiery and carpets to "Shopkeepers", came through his family's hosiery shop. From 1754 to 1765 the directory listing is simply "Thos. Moore Hosier, 63 Chiswell St." without the carpet-making. I wish to thank Mr. Arthur Hudd, of the British Museum staff, for this directory-searching. 35 Keynes gives the dimensions as "Engraved surface 26.5 x 24 cm. Plate-mark 35.5 x 27.3 cm.", but the sides of this print are trimmed edges not plate-marks. From the evidence of J 96 we can deduce that the original plate was at least 32 cm. wide, the cut being made considerably short of the center of the engraved portion. One more plate of Jerusalem size could have been cut from the remaining top portion, potentially supplying two pages, but no other page shows traces of the carpet advertisement. One of the pages measuring around 15 cm. in width could have been made from the back of such a cut, but without knowing its height we cannot guess which. Blake would, of course, use the backs first. It seems likely that J 64, identical in dimensions to J 96 and bearing a plate-maker's stamp which shows it to be the back of a plate, was etched on the same piece of copper. Cut to match other Jerusalem plates, this we might expect to be neither very different from the others in shape nor precisely similar to plates cut in a batch. The measurements given below support this expectation (see "Sizes of Plates"). 36 Professor John Grant, in correspondence, suggests that "Blake made the two fold mistake because he forgot that he was no longer fighting with the scientists." Sloss and Wallis (I, 635) read "Sexual Twofold" and find it "inexplicable." Wicksteed (p. 247) says that Blake first etched "Threefold" then mended "with infinite trouble" to the reading "Twofold" and then, anticipating such criticism as that of Sloss and Wallis, "contrived to change the word back to 'Threefold'" in the Mellon copy. The only contrivance was to leave the print untouched! 37 Only very slight beveling is found on the uncut edge of the America fragment (see note 6 above) and on the edges of the plates for the Dante illustrations (Rosenwald Collection). Moreover the plate outlines that show especially in the heavily impressed posthumous copies indicate very little rounding of the edges of the Jerusalem plates. From examination of these materials I judge that the difference between the front and the back of a Jerusalem plate would seldom amount to as much as 1 mm.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The production of a computer concordance to Middle English texts for which no standard, or received, edition exists, but which exist in several non-uniform editions, requires two distinct operations. 1 Our preparation of A Computer Concordance to Five Middle English Poems : Pearl , Patience , Cleanness , Sir Gawain and the Green Knight , and St. Erkenwald , soon to be printed by the University of Pittsburgh Press, illustrates very nicely the exact nature of the operations. 2 The first is textual. A satisfactory reading of the MSS. must be obtained; i.e., one has to have or prepare a "best" copy edition or text, taking "best" in such a case to mean that which might best accord with the capabilities of the available computer system as well as best represent the MSS. The second operation is technical. A method has to be devised to translate the text into a "machine readable" format so that the computer system can digest it and perform operations with it; i.e., listing words, comparing them, sorting them, collecting them with an appropriate context, and printing at last the completed concordance. These operations are different, to be sure, yet we soon found out that we were unable to proceed with the textual problems until we had clearly understood the technical requirements. We had, for example, to resolve certain orthographical distinctive features of our text in favor of the printing limitations of our computer system; not only did we eliminate all punctuation points but also all occurrences of the grapheme þ, to cite one instance, had to be changed to upper case TH, and, for another instance, the entire corpus had to printed out in upper case letters. 3 The entire textual problem is perhaps best described by Professor C. O. Chapman. In response to our inquiry, Mr. Chapman reminded us that ". . . there is no uniform text of the five poems such as we have in Skeat's Chaucer , and the variations of spelling within each poem, as well as the presence of four or five editors, each transcribing a poem according to his own method, have resulted in great confusion. It has long seemed to me that such a uniform text for these poems, as Skeat's for Chaucer, is an indispensible prerequisite to the making of a concordance." 4 The wisdom of that conclusion is evident to all who know these poems. The occurrence of BOT in "Cleanness," 473 is a case in point. The form BOT occurs 324 times in these texts. It may be a noun, a verb, or an adverb, or also a preposition or a conjunction. When it equates generally with Modern English but it is not to be concorded, but is to be found in a listing of common words not concorded. If, however, it equates with Modern English remedy , help , announce , or proclaim it is concorded. Since the form BOTE also occurs 11 times in these texts, either with the meaning of boat or boot (i.e., remedy ), one would expect that BOT ought not to occur where elsewhere BOTE is used. Now "Cleanness," 473 reads "Bryng bod-worde to bot blysse to us all." Sir Israel Gollancz reads a noun, remedy , taking BOT from Old English bōt ; R. J. Menner reads a verb, announce , taking BOT from Old English bodian . This difference means, of course, that both men take a different attitude towards BLYSSE. If BOT in this instance means remedy it has to be found in our concordance under Modern English boot , whereas if it means announce , we should have to list it under Modern English bode , where immediately it would look like one of the more than a dozen forms of BIDE. As a saving grace, BOOT, meaning any sort of covering for the foot, does not, thank goodness, occur. In the same poem, does FLEE3, 1476, mean fleece or flies , and does GENTYLE, 1432, mean gentle or gentile ? Editors do not agree. Or in "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," 1634, does HERE mean hear or praise ? These few instances are but a fraction of the occurrence of forms which called for editorial decisions. One word, two words, or compound; spelling variations; homographs and homonyms; these are a few of the editorial problems we faced. We obviously needed the "uniform text" Mr. Chapman spoke of. There was nothing for us to do but to make one. We did it in this fashion. Our first step, of course, was to assemble all the printed critical editions of the five poems and, lacking access to the MSS., facsimile reproductions of MS. Cott. Nero A.x. + 4 and Brit. Mus. MS. Harl. 2250. We were able, after examination, to exclude several of the printed editions, so that as we faced up to the tedious chore of collation we found it necessary to include but one "variant" edition with each of our "base" editions for four of the poems, but three "variant" editions of "Pearl" were required along with the "base" edition. In order to provide a three space identification symbol for the five poems, a symbol the computer could easily manage, we chose the standard abbreviations of the titles of these poems. The following designations, wherein the three letter symbol alone signifies our base edition, and the symbol followed by V or a number signifies a variant edition, were assigned: GGK The 1940 Gollancz edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight . GGK V The 1952 reprint of the 1925 Tolkien and Gordon edition. CLN The 1921 Gollancz edition of Cleanness . CLN V The 1920 Menner edition. PRL The 1953 Gordon edition of Pearl . PRL 1 The 1906 Osgood edition. PRL 2 The 1921 Gollancz edition. PRL 3 The 1933 Bowdoin College edition. PAT The 1924 Gollancz edition of Patience . PAT V The 1918 Bateson edition. ERK The 1920 Gollancz edition of St. Erkenwald . ERK V The 1926 Savage edition. We knew at this stage of our work that eventually an IBM card punch operator should have to have in front of her an accurate copy text of these poems so that she could punch on one card one line of the text followed by an identification symbol and the line number of that line in its text. The single object of our collation was to provide that copy text. Because Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is the longest of these five poems we chose to work first with it. Our decision to use the 1940 Gollancz edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as base text committed us to certain procedures. For example, we retain -3 as a grapheme, we retain the U/V practise of both Gollancz and Tolkien and Gordon, and we retain the I/Y practice of both editions. Since no punctuation whatsoever is retained, we were obliged to disregard punctuation variants. 5 All occurrences of þ we had to change to TH. All brackets in the text were eliminated, &amp; was changed to AND, and we simply treated all italicized printings as if they were printed regularly. The hyphen caused the greatest difficulty. In general, we eliminated the hyphen when, for example, it was used in the base text to separate morphemes which ordinarily are not separated. Thus to cite but a few examples which occur early in the poem, we changed VP-ON to VPON (GGK, 47), DE-BATED to DEBATED (GGK, 68), and IN-NOGHE to INNOGHE (GGK, 77). Here, of course, we followed the practice of Tolkien and Gordon. Similarly, we print FORSOTHE as one word in each instance, whereas, in all editions of all five poems, that form may occur as one word, as two words (GGK, 415), or as a hyphenated word. A curious instance is the occurrence of GOD + MON. This combination may occur as two words, i.e., a good man , but it also occurs as one word, i.e., head of a household . Thus GGK, 1029, reads GOD-MON, GGK V, 1029, reads GOD MON, but we print one word, GODMON. Even more disturbing is GGK, 157, where HEME-WEL HALED occurs. In GGK V, 157, that form is printed as HEME WEL-HALED. The facsimile MS. indicates three words. 6 Since this line shows about as well as any other what an editor of a Middle English text faces, it will be worth a moment to look at it closely. The line is printed as follows: HEME-WEL HALED HOSE OF THAT SAME GRENE GGK 157 HEME WEL-HALED HOSE OF THAT SAME GRENE GGK V 157 The MS. reading has to be taken as HEME WEL HALED. Now both Gollancz and Tolkien and Gordon derive Middle English HAL (L)E from Old French haler , and suggest "rise, depart, rush, draw, lift, come, go, pass, and loose from a bow" as Modern English equivalents. Tolkien and Gordon regard HEME as an adjective, derived from Old English gehœme , meaning "neat" and WEL-HALED as another adjective, simply a combination of WEL + HAL (L) E, maening "pulled up properly" or "drawn tight." Gollancz considers HEME-WEL to be an adjective meaning "well fitting" which is closely allied to HEMELY, "closely," which he derives from Old Norse heimolliga , "privately," and for which he suggests Old English cognates hām and hæm- . One should therefore have to translate GGK, 157, as "well fitting drawn (up) stockings of that same green color" and GGK V, 157, as "neat properly pulled up stockings of that same green color." Admittedly the concorder is not a lexicographer, and ordinarily one turns to a concordance not to find a discrimination of lexical meanings but instead a listing of forms, of words. And it probably is of little importance, in this instance, to suggest that "well fitting drawn up stockings" are not very much different, if different at all, from "neat properly pulled up stockings," or that HEME-WEL and HEME might be synonyms after all. Yet it is a matter of importance to the counter of words to know how many times HEME, HEME-WEL, HALED, and WEL-HALED occur in these texts. Here we were obliged to face up to the entire matter of compounds versus two words or hyphenated words. After a great deal of thought, we decided to eliminate the hyphen wherever possible, and to choose one word rather than two words wherever it clearly seemed to us that the resulting one form represented a unified lexical entity which readers of Middle English would recognize. Thus we print HEME-WEL for GGK, 157, and WELHALED for GGK V, 157. 7 Some further idea of the complications we struggled with can be got from observing that HAL and HAL (L) E, the word we started with in this demonstration, also occur as nouns, meaning "castle" or "hall." Nevertheless, our decision to eliminate the hyphen wherever possible provides, we think, a clearer reading of the texts. It also precluded several technical problems, since an abundance of hyphenated forms could cause a certain amount of machine confusion. Of course, we did retain the hyphen in PRL, 195, FLOR-DE-LYS, where we felt FLORDELYS was an impossible form. Treated as separate words, moreover, we would have created an unnecessary homonym with FLOR meaning "floor" and have inserted, rather falsely, two French forms in our listings. 8 Two other editorial decisions were made. First, we retained all proper names in their Middle English forms. This seemingly innocuous procedure caused an amusing problem, for the form AGRAUYN A LA DURE MAYN presents four French words. We quickly eliminated A and LA from the list of words to be concorded, but both DURE and MAYN occur elsewhere as Middle English words, meaning endure and main , and these occurrences of those forms naturally turned up with the others. 9 But under the Modern English headwords HARD and HAND, DURE and MAYN do not appear. In justice to Agravain's too sordid late reputation, we suppose they ought to appear. Second, a certain amount of regularization seemed desirable. We therefore follow the orthographical practice of GGK throughout; i.e., we did not consistently normalize spellings, but retained the C-K, the I-Y, the I-J, the -ES and -E3, and the U-V or U-W distinctions. We did, however, change all occurrences of QUOD to QUOTH, all occurrences of VUS to VS. Our principle here is a simple one. A concordance is used with the available printed texts. There is no standard, received edition of these poems, so our copy text actually is the closest yet to the "uniform text" Mr. Chapman spoke of. Having chosen the Gollancz edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as the base text for the longest of our poems, it seemed only reasonable to us to make all other printed editions conform to its orthography. In view of the presently available printed editions of these poems, the editions one would have at hand while using our concordance, little good would have resulted had we expended further energy in replacing initial 3 with Y and medial or final 3 with GH or W. Finally, to be done with these matters, we changed BERTILAK, GGK, 2445, to the better supported form BERCILAK, we did not use at all the spurious line, GGK, 2445*, we changed TON and DON, ERK, 5-6, to TOUN and DOUN, and we omitted altogether all occurrences of AMEN as well as the motto HONY SOYT QUI MAL PENCE. The results of our collation were interesting but not startling. The principal achievement, after all, was the production, following the procedures just described, of a uniform text of the five poems. We did not make and adopt a single new emendation. We did not suggest, even, a single new reading of the MS. But we did record, and therefore preserve for consideration, a rather large number of variants. All are truly lexical variants. That is a finding of some significance. Differences of spelling or punctuation do not alter the word stock of a MS., but some differences of MS. readings do. Let us be specific for a moment. The editors of all our printed editions examined the same MS. If, as they do, one editor prints for GGK, 77, Toulouse and the other prints tolouse , and one prints [ &amp; ] where the other prints of , we need not be concerned. The difference between an upper case and lower case printing is not lexically a significant difference, especially for a computer concordance which is printed entirely in upper case letters. Neither is the difference between [ &amp; ] (or AND) and of significant, because both words are omitted, not concorded at all, since they meet the requirements of a classification found in all concordances, a list of "common words not concorded." Actually, as the one editor admits, the MS. clearly reads of . We found many variants like these two occurrences, and we simply ignored them. Many variants, however, could not be ignored. When in CLN, 745, the line is printed as THEN THE BURNE OBECHED HYM AND BO3SOMLY HIM THONKKE3 while in CLN V, 745, the same line is rendered THEN ABRAHAM OBECHED HYM AND HY3LY HIM THONKKE3, and the MS. clearly reads ABRAHAM and not THE BURNE, and appears to read LO3LY where these editors show BO3SOMLY and HY3LY, we found a problem on our hands. We saw no reason to retain THE BURNE, but we saw that it was reasonable to retain BO3SOMLY and HY3LY, since both forms represent reasonable decisions of editors who examined the very same spot in the MS. Therefore this one line in the MS. grew into two lines in printed editions and two lines for us also. Our concordance will show both lines, for we concluded that an honest lexical difference existed, and that support for both BO3SOMLY and HY3LY could be adduced, and that we should count these forms as actual occurrences. In all we found a considerable number of significant variant lines. In examining the poems, we noted 72 lines of the total of 2530 lines in GGK where significant differences occurred, 64 lines of 1812 lines of CLN, 112 lines of 1212 lines of PRL, only 9 lines of 531 lines of PAT, and 18 lines of 352 lines of ERK. Of the 6437 total lines, then, we discovered 275 variant lines. That means, of course, that we not only added 275 lines of verse to our corpus (almost another poem as long as ERK) but that we also considerably affected both the total word stock and the number of occurrences of a good many individual forms. For example, if a line showed but one difference, say MUCH as against MUTH (PAT and PAT V, 54), both forms, to be sure, were concorded, but also every other word in what was originally one MS. line had to be tallied twice, for each word in both lines of the printed editions was spotted under its headword, and a single word, say CHEKES, which both editors show for this same line, would be cited twice under its headword. Our frequency tally shows that CHEKES occurs three times in these poems, but it really occurs only twice. Since all variant printings are marked with a V, or a number in the case of PRL, a reader of our concordance will have to subtract one from the total occurrences of any given form for each occurrence which is so marked. To make this perfectly clear, suppose a reader wishes to know how many times the word "date" occurs. Our frequency list will show 15 occurrences, but a glance at the fifteen lines containing this word under the headword DATE will reveal that three of the lines are marked as variant lines, and that therefore DATE actually occurs only 12 times. It is not that DATE is in way suspect, but that in ERK, 205, it is A LAPPID DATE while ERK V, 205, has it A LEWID DATE, and that in PRL, 528, it is WYL DAY WAT3 PASSED DATE while both PRL 1 and PRL 3 have it WYLDAY WAT3 PASSED DATE — our one word or two word puzzle again, and in this instance not to be resolved. It will be seen that variants are a bit of a bother to the concorder. This is not the place to display all the variants we discovered; let it suffice that our collation was necessary, that it turned up some interesting significant differences, and that it is one more problem a maker of a concordance of a Middle English text must reckon with. 10 Our uniform text in hand, we turned to our second operation. Any sense of relief we might have experienced at having "solved" the textual problems, being able at last to release our text to an efficient machine, was short-lived. Initially, things did indeed run smoothly. A very capable operator, loaned to us for the purpose by the University of Pittsburgh's Health Law Center, punched our text and produced, in approximately 40 hours, 6712 IBM cards, each card punched with one line of text, its proper title abbreviation, and its proper line number in its own text. The Health Law Center also printed out that initial deck of cards. In another week the print-out was proofread, and all errors noted were quickly corrected by simply punching a complete new card for each error discovered. Our initial deck of cards, now corrected and carrying in its own punched format our uniform text, was now ready for the IBM 7070. Once again we were fortunate. Mr. Charles Bacon, a Systems Analyst in our Computation and Data Processing Center who had become interested in our project, agreed to prepare the program for the concordance. 11 Largely in Mr. Bacon's words, this is the program he prepared. The initial deck of cards was punched (as we have just described) so that each card was completely identified without regard to the order in which the deck was stacked. The first computer program was written to read these cards and perform the following functions. First, it loaded into the computer a common word list, 146 words not to be concorded, which, eliminated, lightened the load on the rest of the system. Second, the program read each text card and preserved its content as a "card image." That "card image," at this stage, was scanned by a sub-program designed to find each separate word and move it to a twenty-letter area, making sure that the first letter of each word was always placed in the first column of that twenty-letter area. Third, the program wrote out that area, immediately followed by the complete "card image," as a connected tape record. When all the words from a given card had either been written on to tape, the "card image" being repeated as many times as non-common words appeared on the card, or eliminated as common words, the next card was read, and the process repeated. The second computer program was designed to sort the connected tape record. The record was sorted, alphabetically, first according to the individual words and second according to the poem title abbreviation. A third sorting according to line number completed this program. The entire sorting process was performed by making use of a standard program written for general sorting requirements. The third, and last, computer program was designed to transfer the sorted tape record on to cards in a format suited to the printing requirements of the concordance. At this stage a second common word list was introduced. (Personal pronouns and all forms of the verbs have and be comprised this list. Our reasons for desiring this list will be explained later on.) Words contained in this list are to be printed in a separate listing, identified by poem title abbreviation and line number only, instead of being displayed in an entire line of text. The sorted tape record, therefore, was punched out in such a manner that three card formats were produced: first, the individual word by itself (i.e., a headword), second, the original line of verse taken from the copy text, and, third, the display of numerical references. Thus 36,831 cards were produced and stacked in an order which would produce, as they were run through a printer, the final concordance. After Mr. Bacon had devised that program he supervised the actual run of the entire process, from the first step of loading our initial deck to the last step of stacking the 36,831 cards for the printer. The IBM 7070 is an extremely rapid machine. The entire operation took but a very short time. The first phase, loading our initial deck of 6712 cards and transferring our text to magnetic tape, required but 25 minutes. The second phase, the entire sorting process, required 45 minutes. The last phase, the punch-out of the sorted tape record, required 4 hours. The actual machine time, then, from initial loading to stacking of the punched output in proper order for printing, was just 5 hours and 10 minutes. The printer was a bit slower; it required 8 hours to print the whole concordance. The entire operation thus required 13 hours and 10 minutes. We very carefully gathered up the continuous sheet which bore our project, separated the roll into sheets, stacked and bound them, and carried them off, hopefully, after a rapid proofreading, to send the concordance, with some slight introduction prepared conventionally, to be reproduced in an offset process by the university press. At this happy time we encountered our largest disappointment. Had our poems been written in twentieth century English our first printout, without doubt, could have been reproduced, just as Mr. Parrish described it for the Arnold concordance. But ours are fourteenth century poems, and they were not written in twentieth century English. It is almost, looking back at it now, as if some huge irony were on purpose lodged within our texts, as if those old poets were now able to confound us, to dare us to reduce their art to a modern machine manageable format. Mr. Parrish and his associates were dismayed, he tells us, to see AAR and AARAU as the first two items in their concordance. As we looked over our product we were shocked. The more carefully we searched, the greater was our concern. We saw chaos. It seems best to us to produce for examination here a sample of our first print out. In this fashion we can describe the true nature of the technological problems we now faced. Also, most of our principles, our feeling of what this concordance should be, can be induced from the very data we worked with. Picked quite at random, here is one sheet of our first print out.

These numbers, 7714-7802, identify the position of the 62 cards of our total deck of 36,831 cards, placed in the order shown, which carried that portion of the first print out reproduced here. They are concordance line numbers. In the final off-set printing, these numbers, suppressed, will not appear. Their utility to us at this stage of our work, as will soon be evident, was enormous. Actually, we faced the problem of orthographical variants as well as that of Middle English versus Modern English headwords long before we had our first print out of the entire concordance. We at the start obtained a print out of the complete lexicon, and, working with it and our copy text, attempted to devise a system of cross referencing which would allow to retain all headwords in their Middle English form. But cross referencing became so complicated that we were forced to give it up; users of the concordance so arranged would find it unnecessarily complex. We decided then that we should have to use some Modern English headwords. As we shall point out shortly, what we had to do was no less than to print out a concordance (our original complete print out) in order to make our final concordance. We explored the possibility of producing a program which would permit the computer to gather forms together and shift them from their original position to some other position in the final ordering of all forms, but were unable to produce such a program. We were obliged to proceed along other lines. Suppose, now, that this 62 line sample concordance were the final version of this portion of the whole concordance. And suppose, further, that a reader entered the concordance at the headword DEWYNE. How would he know that he should find, 421 lines further along, roughly eight pages in the printed book, a variant form, DOWYNE? What instructions ought we provide? Or, earlier in our work, ought we to have spotted the DEWYNE — DOWYNE variation and regularized all three occurrences to DEWYNE? (It would have been a simple matter, actually, because the excellent glossary in Gordon's Pearl does, on p. 127, link these forms.) Such a procedure, carried out consistently in our five poems, however, would have been an impossible task; thousands of forms would have had to be changed and our texts, as well, would have been seriously violated. Moreover, we would have produced a concordance to a text unknown to anyone. Hence, we did not regularize spelling. Ought we to have chosen a Modern English headword and printed both forms under it? The Middle English form is derived from Old English dwīnan , meaning "languish, pine away." We do not use Modern English headwords unless the Modern English development of the Middle English form closely resembles the Middle English form. It would not do, in this case, to use LANGUISH as a headword for these forms (the poets did not know that word), and there is no Modern English form *DEVINE. We chose to retain DEWYNE as headword, and to print all three occurrences of it here, these two occurrences, concordance line numbers 7791 and 7792, and concordance line number 8212, which contains the form DOWYNE. Where DOWYNE falls out in the concordance as a headword, at present as concordance line number 8211, we have replaced that card with a new card which carries this format: DOWYNE (V. DEWYNE). We therefore make it certain for the reader that he indeed finds the three occurrences of the Middle English forms which equate with Modern English "languish." 12 It might appear, at this juncture, that our simplest solution would have been the elaborate cross reference key we attempted earlier to devise. We could have retained all Middle English headwords, and directed attention to other places in the concordance where variant forms of semantically similar items occurred. Very carefully we started through our first print out and marked vide references after those headwords for which variant forms occurred. The very first entry on the print out was ABATAYLMENT. It was marked to read: ABATAYLMENT (V. BATELMENT). That procedure was designed to carry a reader from the first line to concordance line number 1975, where he would see BATELMENT. BATELMENT, of course, had to be changed to read: BATELMENT (V. ABATAYLMENT). After some time we gave it up. Not only did it turn out that we should have to mark well over half of our total stock of headwords, but it turned out also, in some cases, that we had to cite as many as fourteen vide references for a single headword, and thus to mark each of those fourteen co-occurring variant forms. Moreover, it proved impossible always to indicate which form constituted the principal entry. Had we persisted, the result would have been an inefficient concordance, if not an inadequate one. Users would have been forced to turn back and forth so frequently that they well might have concluded that such searching was not worth the effort. We therefore concluded that the concordance had to be rearranged so that it would present the sorted word stock of our five poems in the most convenient and useful form for the type of reader we imagined would most want to consult it. We decided, then, that forms which were phonemically and lexically alike but graphemically different had to be drawn together under a common headword. For example, we have grouped under the Modern English headword CHRIST all occurrences of CRIST, CRISTE, CRYST, KRYST, and KRYSTE. Forms which are lexically alike but are morphemically or morphophonemically different are distinguished. We count DEUEL and DEUELE3 as two words, and we count GODE (or GOOD, GOODE, GOUD, GOUDE), BETTER, BEST (or BESTE) as three words. In short, all lexical variants are distinguished (the chief aim of a concordance) and, at a second level of distinction, within the major form classes all significant structural differences are distinguished. Thus: Nouns — singular and plural forms are listed separately, but case is ignored, especially, lacking an apostrophe, since genitive singulars and plurals cannot be distinguished from other case singulars and plurals; 13 Verbs — the five paradigmatic forms are listed separately, i.e., infinitive, 3d sing. pres. indic., pret., p. partic., and pres. partic., with no distinction made between pret. and p. partic. forms unless a distinctive difference exists, as, in Modern English, say, between RODE and RIDDEN; Adjectives — the stem, comparative degree, and superlative degree are listed separately; Adverbs and all other Form Classes — these presented no especial problems. We have, here and there, already said a few things about the choice of headwords. In general, we find Parrish's description of the matter quite sound, and his solution for a text like ours reasonable. We have, however, made one significant change. Parrish suggests that the ". . . optimum concordance to an early text is of a third type, in which the lines of verse are given in their original form but index words are modernized . . . ." (p. 10.) Our lines of verse are in their original form, but we did not modernize all headwords (index words). Usefulness to the reader was again in our minds, and consequently we modernized a headword only when the Middle English form closely resembles the Modern English form. We retained the Middle English form when no closely similar Modern English form exists. Where modernized, the Middle English form will not occur at all as a headword; e.g., from the sample page we have reproduced here, the headword DEWOUTLY, concordance line 7787, occurs, but in our revised concordance that form will not appear as a headword, and, instead, under the Modern English form DEVOUTLY, which will be inserted in place of the present concordance line 7741, concordance lines 7742 and 7787 will be listed. From the list of words which appear on this same sample page, only three — DEVAYE, DEW, and DEWYNE — are retained in their Middle English forms; DEW also happens to be the Modern English form, but "deny" does not at all look like DEVAYE, and DEWYNE had to be treated as we have already described it. There is a third choice. Some Middle English words do not closely resemble their Modern English counterparts but do tend to suggest them. Words of this class are retained as headword entries, but citations are not printed beneath them. Instead, such a headword will carry a vide reference after it, that reference being a Modern English form, and under the Modern English form the citations will be situated. From this sample page, two such entries are indicated: DE3E will read DE3E (V. DIE) and DE3TER will read DE3TER (V. DAUGHTER), and concordance lines 7794 and 7796 (since DE3EN is an unlevelled form of DE3E) will be located under DIE, which will follow DID, line 7833, while the five DE3TER citations will be spotted under DAUGHTER, to be relocated some 650 lines back, immediately after concordance line 7059, a line containing the form DAUBE. In short, we derived three types of headwords: the Middle English form, the Modern English form, and the "in between" Middle English vide Modern English form. With that in mind, it is clear to see how we established, to finish with the forms on this sample page, the paradigms DEVOID—DEVOIDS—DEVOIDED—DEVOIDING and DEVISE—DEVISES—DEVISED. The sources of our headwords DEVOUTLY, DIVINE, and DEVICE are likewise clear. And all the forms on this sample will be resituated as we have explained it. All this activity, with some decision called for at every entry in the concordance, with uncommon persistence required to uncover all the alternates and variant spellings (even making sure, to give another example, to search out apathetic forms—thus we chose to take concordance line 2030, BAYST, and relocate it as line 1, as Modern English ABASHED), with a gnawing frustration but ever growing knowledge of our texts, and respect for them, attending it, all this constituted our "post-machine" editing. From the original print out, then, we made the necessary changes in headwords, and using the line numbers assigned to the entries, we rearranged the concordance. As we have said, we discussed the possibility of writing a program which would enable the computer to rearrange the concordance, but were unable to produce that program. In any case, it seems clear that we should have had to produce the changes in headwords and the instructions for rearrangement by hand, as we did, before a complex program could be written. It took two people 200 hours to do that work by hand—a staggering number of hours compared with what the computer was able to do in less than 14 hours. At this moment we see no other alternative. It is another problem for all concorders of Old English or Middle English texts. Relocating the out put deck of 36,831 cards has proved to be an equally arduous task. Since thousands of operations are involved, it was apparent that we could not count on the IBM 7070 to perform the work. To switch card and concordance line number 2030 to line number 1, for example, would require a distinct program, simple to be sure, but costly. To sort out the line numbers 16575, 16576, 16463 . . . 5013, 16582, 16583 . . . 16592-98 . . . 508, 16465 (40 occurrences, in all, of what we list under Modern English CAST) and move this entire newly arranged unit so that it is spotted after what is at present line number 5011 would require another distinct program, a more complicated one, also costly. With these two instances expanded to thousands, it should be clear why the computer is ill suited for that assignment. Perhaps in the future an extremely sophisticated program might be devised to perform that kind of operation efficiently. At the present time it is not possible. We are completing this arduous work manually. The utility of the concordance line numbers will now be apparent. A simple program was devised to print the matching concordance line number on each of our 36,831 out put cards. That entire deck now is so marked; i.e., each punched card now carries the same number on it as the line number it represents. Thus an individual card, run through the printer some time ago, and which generated a line of our original print out, can now be picked out from all the other 36,830 out put cards. All our "post machine" editing was performed right on the original print out sheets. The instructions are quite clear. They go along like this: place card 2030 in position 1; next place card 1952, then 2028, then 1, followed by 2, 3, 6, 9, 7, and so on. Nimble fingers and a patient eye have taken over the work. It is not yet completed, but the end is in sight. When new headword cards have been punched and inserted at the proper places (i.e., those instances where we did not retain the Middle English headword) the freshly ordered deck of cards will be ready for machine printing. The print out of that deck should constitute our final concordance, and it, after proofreading, will be reproduced in an offset printing. A few minor problems occurred. We had, for example, to examine each of the 2937 occurrences of THE to pick out the 146 instances where the form equates with the pronoun "thee." The other 2791 occurrences were not concorded. So, too, did we examine the 687 occurrences of ON to pick out the 34 instances where it equates with "one." We wanted to get a separate listing of all pronouns, and therefore all occurrences of THE and ON had to be examined. Readers of Middle English will, we think, find one of the appendices to our concordance especially useful. All occurrences of pronouns, sometimes missing from concordances or scattered alphabetically throughout the concordance, and all forms of BE and HAVE (as well as BE and HAVE plus a negative particle) are collected in one listing. Here the reader will find these forms concorded by poem title and poem line number, but not with line of verse citations. The structure and syntactical behavior of these forms are particularly interesting in Middle English. We have made it possible for a reader to locate very quickly every occurrence of these forms in our five poems. Two other appendices should also be useful. We have provided a list of headwords (here entirely in Middle English) in order of the frequency of their occurrence. Parrish's statement of this feature of the Cornell Concordances (p. 12) receives our wholehearted support. It is good to know, very quickly, what words a poet chooses to use more frequently than other words. It is more than merely 'good to know' that; here is an avenue to insight. To use the Arnold concordance itself, for example, it was something of a surprise to discover that Arnold used the word day more frequently than the word night , for, influenced no doubt by admiration of "Dover Beach," it somehow seemd that it should have turned out the other way around. The frequency list of our concordance will no doubt be put to good use. We also thought it would be helpful (our last appendix) to list all the variant lines we uncovered in our collation of the texts we used. Read against each base text we used, this list, sorted according to poem titles, will disclose where variations exist in the other editions we employed. The 9 variant lines of PAT, for example, are, by line number only, disclosed at a glance. There is no more. I want now to return to my own voice. Mr. Kottler likes to think of our work as a computer concordance shaped by man. It is hard to imagine a better way to put it. Surely, as this record is reviewed, it will occur to anyone to ask why in the world did they use the 7070 in the first place. We used it, after our "pre-machine" textual work was completed, work to be done in any case no matter what technique might afterwards be employed to evolve the concordance, because the IBM 7070 gave us the original print out in a day. It might have taken us a year to do it manually. And, most important of all, we hardly realized what we had to contend with until we had that print out. Unless a corps of co-workers is constituted to prepare a concordance, as Parrish describes the work of the Dante Society of America (p. 1), the machine is indispensible. As I hear of new techniques, particularly those which eliminate the necessity for using punched cards to transfer a text to magnetic tape, or those which skillfully have made use of extremely sophisticated programs, programs designed to handle enormous numbers of variables, and some of these programs aimed squarely at human discourse, oral or written, and not just numbers or other symbols more readily amenable than phonemic or graphemic structures to the operation of binary arithmetic, I feel sure that in the future a concordance such as ours could be produced much more efficiently than we have managed it. If we have not been efficient, we have been reliable. I have been reading Lane Cooper's delightful account of the evolution of his Concordance of Wordsworth, "The Making and the Use of a Verbal Concordance." 14 Naturally, I wondered how he might have described what we have been doing with our concordance. I can also recall the day when I should have looked elsewhere for entertaining reading— "An undergraduate student once assured me that the word God was rare in the writings of Wordsworth; he had heard so in a lecture. It occurs 274 times in the poems of that author. . . ." (p. 21) Indeed. I doubt that this account of our concordance is that entertaining. I also am not sure that it will prove to be "the gift of Hermes to Apollo" (p. 19). But I am sure that we have produced a reliable concordance to five important Middle English poems. I am sure, too, that students of Middle English poetry will find it extremely useful. I am sure, again, that two mediævalists who scarcely knew one another before they started the work have learned a great deal about these poems, about Middle English, and about the behavior of a sophisticated, at many times a very delicate, language. I am sure, at last, that Mr. Kottler is anxious to return to Boethius, to later mediæval commentaries on Boethius, to Chaucer, and, I suspect, to the ordinary human race. I too find myself looking away, to Beowulf, to Gawain, and to Sir Thomas Malory, Kt., who, at this very instant, prods me with his usual good words—"here is the ende."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It will be helpful to keep in mind S. M. Parrish's "Problems in the Making of Computer Concordances," SB , XV (1962), 1-14; see too Paul L. Garvin, "Computer Participation in Linguistic Research," Language , XXXVIII (Oct-Dec 1962), 385-389. A very useful general discussion of Information Retrieval techniques is E. Herbert's "Finding What's Known," International Science and Technology (Jan 1962), pp. 14-23. 2 From the very beginning Prof. Barnet Kottler, Department of English, Purdue University, and I have shared this work. He has seen this article in typescript. It seems fair to me, then, from this point on, to speak as "we, us, or our." 3 We were unable to acquire the "special set of print wheels" described by Parrish, p. 7. Throughout we were able to make use of an IBM 7070 Data Processing System which was, early in the fall of 1960, installed at the University of Pittsburgh's Computation and Data Processing Center. It occurs to us that all future computer concordances might well be prepared in such a fashion that the facilities of the Cornell Concordances Center could be employed; e.g., cards cut and sorted elsewhere could be sent to Ithaca to be printed. Whether or not such an arrangement would be acceptable to the Cornell staff is unknown to us at the moment, but it would appear that this sort of scholarly cooperation and coordination is desirable. The printing requirements for Old English and Middle English texts are considerable. Beyond the need for concordances, other types of analyses beg attention; see W. N. Francis's excellent description, "Graphemic Analysis of Late Middle English Manuscripts," Speculum , XXXVII (Jan 1962), 32-47, esp. 46. 4 Letter to the author from Professor C. O. Chapman of the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma 6, Washington, 19 December, 1960. We have, of course, consulted his Index of Names in Pearl , Purity , Patience , and Gawain , Cornell Studies in English, Vol. XXXVIII (1951) as well as his "Concordance of the Works of the Pearl-Poet," unpublished dissertation (Cornell University, 1927). 5 It was a choice between a restricted number of punctuation points, the period and comma only, or none at all. We chose none at all as the less confusing practice. Absence of the apostrophe, however, throws genitive singular and any plural forms together; e.g., ABRAHAMS equals Abraham's. This, of course, reflects the MSS. more accurately than the printed editions do. Cf. n. 2, supra . 6 Although we frequently examined the facsimile MSS., as we did in this instance, such examinations, in general, were of little help to us. Word divisions in fourteenth century MSS. are often capricious, and it would be risky indeed to base decisions on word boundaries just on the MS. evidence alone. As will be seen, we were obliged to consider other evidence and other requirements before reaching our decisions. 7 Since we chose to use some Middle English words and some Modern English words as headwords, readers of our concordance will find an entry, HEMEWEL, and one occurrence of it, this line, GGK, 157. HEMEWEL is thus for us a Middle English word. But WELHALED, which also occurs this one time only, and is for us a Middle English word, will be found under the Modern English headword WELL-HALED, / -heyld / (as in "haled into court"), where, ironically, we were forced to use the hyphenated form, because WELLHALED is an unrecognizable Modern English form. As it is, only a reader who realizes that "hale" is an older form of "haul" will recognize WELL-HALED at first sight. The whole matter of choice of headwords is described later on. 8 We chose the hyphen, too, to retain a delightful Middle English preposition, and printed in GGK, 1200, TO-HIR-WARDE. Our practice, to be done with this puzzle of hyphenated or single forms, would cause us to print, were our poems in Modern English, such forms as COWCATCHER, STREETCAR, and perhaps STREETWALKER. It did cause us to print NW3ER and NW3ERES as single words under the Modern English headwords NEW YEAR and NEW YEARS, as well as to print ASTIT for either AS TIT or AS-TIT. But if one keeps the relationship which exists in English between phonemes and graphhemes in mind, some sanity will be seen to occur in our procedure. We can state this in spite of the fact that if, say, one were to ask us how many times a distinct form, such as WEL, occurs we should have to give an evasive answer. For a succinct, sensible statement about the use of the hyphen in English spelling, see R. A. Hall, Jr., Sound and Spelling in English (Philadelphia, Chilton Co., 1961), pp. 16-22. 9 In GGK, 1281, incidentally, A occurs as a variant of HO (Modern English "she"), and will be noted in a separate listing of pronouns, although elsewhere, as an article, it is not concorded. Similarly, we eliminated DE and LA from MADOR DE LA PORT and DODDINAL DE SAUAGE. 10 At the risk of being exceedingly tedious, let us explore this matter a bit further. A fundamental question is involved here. To what extent must the concorder of a Middle English text be an editor? And what kind of an editor? Our aim was to produce an accurate uniform copy edition (text) for a key punch operator. We did produce a uniform text, but although we made as reasonable a text as we could, although we constantly sought a defensible rationale for the sort of editorial decisions we made, and have described here, it is still in some of its parts an arbitrary text. We see no other solution. Prof. Chapman, for example, might well object that we have made no significant advance in textual considerations beyond his work of thirty-six years ago. In some particulars we have. To have gone all the way, however, would have meant that we should have had to produce a fresh critical edition, to have checked every word against the MS. and all printed editions. In short, we would have had to produce a variorum edition. There was no time for that. Moreover, the concordance will be used with the available editions of these poems, and for that purpose it is accurate. Even if a fresh, final edition of these poems does appear later on, the usefulness of the concordance will not seriously be impaired. Nevertheless, the 275 variant lines do indeed suggest that we do not have a perfect concordance. All this further suggests that we never will, with certainty, be able to state what it is the poet actually wrote, and that, consequently, a perfect concordance is not possible. Almost six centuries have elapsed since these poems were composed. All one can hope to do is to come as close to that composition as his data and knowledge will permit. We trust we are not too far removed from the poet. And, to be done with this, we will point out to anyone who prepares a computer concordance of any other Old English or Middle English text that the distance from his composition will undoubtedly be one of his largest concerns. 11 Here again it will be helpful to look to Parrish's description, pp. 4-6. Our program is comparable, although perhaps a bit more sophisticated. It is not, however, as sophisticated as that which Parrish later describes in his paragraph beginning at the bottom of p. 10. 12 It will be of some interest to point out here that the Middle English Dictionary , Part D. 5, Ed. Hans Kurath and Sherman Kuhn (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1962), p. 1370 cites these forms, and these very same lines, under Dwĩnen . None of the infinitive forms there cited occurs in our texts, and it is only these three occurrences of the 1st sing. pres. indic. which occur; therefore we did not treat this form as, say, we treated DEVOID-DEVOIDS-DEVOIDED. Note, too, that the MED prints LUF-DAUN-GERE where we print one word. The occurrence of DOL in PRL, 326, our concordance line 8212, containing the form DOWYNE, will permit us, also, to point out here that we and the MED agree in bringing similar forms together. Under the Modern English headword DOLE we print all the variant forms listed in the MED , Part D. 4, pp. 1208-1211, which occur in our texts, but we do not, as the MED does, separate the forms as homonyms; i.e., under DOLE we show 18 citations, but the form may vary lexically, in Modern English, from "grief" to "a portion." We were unable, in short, to achieve the resolution of the "homograph problem" which Parrish (p. 9) suggests. We would like to agree with Parrish (p.8) that in a Middle English concordance ". . . users may expect to find find homographs discriminated." But the cost and the machine time to effect that discrimination, as Parrish describes it, are prohibitive. Furthermore, it is open to question, we think, if such discrimination actually is necessary. A glance at the citations under ROSE in the Tatlock and Kennedy Chaucer concordance (p. 753), for example, reveals that the context very quickly shows when ROSE is a noun and when a verb. Similarly, although the cases are not precisely alike, a glance at the citations under our DOLE reveals that the context indicates when "grief" is appropriate and when "a portion." Moreover, since DELE in PRL, 51, also occurs as "grief" where elsewhere it occurs as "devil" or "deal out," it seemed wiser to us to bring this occurrence of DELE under our DOLE. Two secondary points to this wandering note are, first, that we had to effect such changes manually and, second, that we assume a user of our concordance will know how, generally, to read Middle English. 13 Thinking of the concordance of the Old English poetic remains (Parrish, p. 8), the question of the significance of case of nouns arises. Were we producing that concordance, we do not, at the moment, know exactly what we would do with an irregular feminine noun, say burg . Would the genitive and dative singular form byrig be given a separate entry, or would both be listed under CITY? BURG would not, we should think, suffice because of current connotations attached to it. And how should the nominative and accusative plural form byrig be distinguished from its singular counterpart? Perhaps it would fall under CITIES (BURGS) along with burga and burgum , the genitive and dative plurals. Is this one or four words? Are CITY and CITIES identical? Perhaps only the context of the line in question can be counted on. That problem, thank the good Lord, did not arise in our work. If a sigh of exasperation is detected, it is intentional; it will be, we feel, a frequent response as man and machine wrestle with obsolete language. 14 In Evolution and Repentance (1935), pp. 18-53.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Milton and the Harvard Pindar by Maurice Kelley and Samuel D. Atkins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Houghton Library at Harvard is a copy of Pindar (Sumner 123) commonly supposed to have belonged to John Milton. Notice of this volume first appears in the Sotheby sale catalogue of the library of J. B. Inglis (1871), where it is described as follows: 1 1588 MILTON (JOHN). Pindari Olympia, Pythia, Nemea, Isthmia, Graecè, Jo. Benedictus innumeris mendis repurgavit, metaphrasi recognita, latina paraphrasi addita, half russia 4to. Salmurii, 1620. This most precious and inestimable volume formerly belonged to the divine Milton. From a note on the title page we learn that he purchased the volume Novemb. 15, 1629, pret. 9s., and at the end, the dates of the period he was occupied in reading it, viz. from June 17 to Sept. 28, 1630. The margins throughout bear his Notes, many of them being very copious, and at the end he has added an Alphabetical Index, occupying two closely written pages, of all the Authors cited (except Homer and Pindar), with references to the different places where they are mentioned in the Annotations, a work of immense perseverance, and which no one except with the greatest labour of love would have done. We cannot speak too highly of this book, nor can we conceive any thing to be more esteemed or revered than this copy of the works of the Prince of Lyric Poets annotated throughout by the Author of the Immortal "Paradise Lost," in his own handwriting. The sale of this book and the purchaser's authentication of it are recounted by B. M. Pickering in an autograph note now pasted in before the front flyleaf of the volume: This book (Pindar) I purchased at Messrs. Sotheby's Aug 5th 1871 my opponent being Mr. Addington the well known collector of autographs — Mr. Waller the dealer in autographs told me after the sale that he had no doubt about the notes being Milton's writing. After its purchase I had an opportunity afforded me of comparing this volume with the Lycophron bought for Mr. Forster at Lord Charlemont's sale The writing compared very satisfactorily therewith when the nature of the paper on which the Lycophron is printed is taken into consideration it being nearly like blotting paper &amp; very difficult to write upon &amp; in another way this Lycophron afforded a strong piece of circumstantial evidence as in this Pindar certain passages of Lycophron occurring at certain pages are referred to and all these passages are to be found exactly at the pages as referred to in the MS notes in this book The date given as the time occupied in the perusal (see end of book before Errata) viz Jun. 17, 1630 to Sept 28-1630 was part of a forced interval of leisure which Milton was compelled to take during his University career owing to the Masters fellows &amp; students all having fled from Cambridge during the ravages of a fearful epidemic from April to end of Nov 1630. Cambridge was completely deserted (see Massons Life of Milton Vol 1 page 200) I gave at the sale £41 for the volume Mr. Addington the under-bidder having bid £40 B M Pickering London 196 Piccadilly Nov 11. 1872 Subsequent to this note — as a clipping from a catalogue now pasted on the front flyleaf indicates — the volume was again offered for sale as Milton's copy, and passed into the possession of Senator Charles Sumner. As a part of his bequest, it was received by Harvard April 28, 1874. Since that time, students of Milton have unanimously accepted the claims of the sale catalogue and Pickering. Hanford, 2 for instance, lists the Harvard Pindar as one of the eight books that bear Milton's "unquestionably genuine autograph." The Columbia Milton 3 pronounces the notes "almost without exception in his own hand," and prints 122 of them with translations. And two other scholars have used the annotations to reconstruct Milton's Greek studies at Cambridge, 4 to identify editions of other classical authors that he read, 5 and to question the practice of dating Milton's handwriting on the basis of the form of e that it contains. 6 Such general acceptance and confident use would seem to establish beyond question Milton's ownership of the Harvard volume; but this ownership is precisely what we propose to query, and our reasons for doing so — set forth briefly under two chief heads of form and content — are as follows. First, the Harvard Pindar does not contain Milton's signature; and lacking this, the volume can be safely accepted as Milton's only if the annotations significantly resemble the notes found in other books unquestionably owned and annotated by Milton. Six such books are extant: Milton's Dante-Della Casa-Varchi volume (New York Public Library), his Aratus (British Museum), his Euripides (Bodleian Library), his Lycophron (Mr. Adrian van Sinderen), his Dio Chrysostom (Chapter Library, Ely Cathedral), and his Heraclides (University of Illinois Library). 7 A comparison of these volumes reveals, however, that the annotations in the six Milton books consistently resemble each other, but differ in numerous ways from the notes in the Harvard Pindar. A specific example of this similarity and disagreement appears in the seven records of purchase reproduced in Plate I. In the Pindar, the date and price appear on the same plane in opposite upper corners of the title page; in the six authentic volumes, signature, price, and date appear in varying order one below the other. In the Pindar, the abbreviation of "pretium" is "pret:"; all six Milton books read "pre:". In the Pindar, the price in even shillings is emphasized by a dash and a zero in the pence column; this practice Milton does not follow in the three instances where no pence are involved. In the manuscript notes, as Plates II-III illustrate, further differences exist. As annotation marks, Milton uses either a grave accent, an asterisk, or a small x , and regularly places these marks on a plane above, if not directly over, the handwritten correction or note. 8 In the Pindar, the annotator often underlines the text, uses no grave accent, and on the occasions that he does use the asterisk or small x , he tends to place them on the same plane as his following note. 9 To call attention to a passage, Milton employs a large X or a perpendicular pen mark resembling a large parenthesis; 10 for the same purpose, the Pindar scribe uses a number of signs not found in the Milton volumes: #, double π, two horizontally parallel wavy lines, a pointing hand, three pyramidically arranged dots or a trefoil above a descending, wavy tail, and two trefoils joined by a sublinear loop. 11 Significant differences also appear in the Greek script. As Plates II-III show, the γ of the Pindar notes tilts so markedly to the right that on one occasion the Columbia editors 12 misread it as a 2; Milton's γ is more perpendicular and often suggests a large V dropped well below the line. 13 In executing μ, both the Pindar scribe and Milton begin by writing a Roman u ; but in completing the letter, the Pindar scribe uses a descending wiggle, Milton a straight line generally terminating in a small hook to the left. 14 In the Pindar notes, the β is the familiar form resembling a tailed B ; in Milton's annotations, the letter frequently appears in a cursive form slightly similar to an italic b . 15 Conversely, the Pindar notes often show a cursive θ that suggests a large 9 tilted to the right; in Milton's notes, the θ is the conventional upright oval and bar. 16 Differences in form, therefore, indicate that the Pindar notes are not in Milton's autograph; and a second kind of difference — this time in content — argues with similar force against attributing the annotations to an amanuensis writing at Milton's dictation. In his annotations of Greek poetry, Milton focusses his attention on the text, and his studies rarely pass beyond the translation, scholia, and commentary in the volume before him. Twelve of Milton's thirty-seven Aratus notes, 17 it is true, derive from collations of his Morel edition with the de Gabiano and Stephanus texts, and three others come "ex aliis editionibus", from Stephanus, Thesaurus Graecae Linguae , and perhaps from Grotius, Syntagma Arateorum ; but in all these fifteen instances, Milton's interest is in text rather than in commentary — in finding the best or an equally good alternative reading; and from this purpose he varies only twice: once to quote Ovid's tribute to Aratus and once to give a parallel from Lucretius. Similarly, Milton's annotations of Lycophron contain two references to the Stephanus Thesaurus (pp. 21, 60), but here again his interest is textual, and his sixty-three remaining notes contain only three references to works outside his volume: to the scholia on the Argonautica (p. 27), to the Metamorphoses of Ovid (p. 145), and to the Ion of Euripides, (p. 156). 18 In over 500 annotations of Euripides, Milton's focus is even sharper: except for a single reference to "Scaliger in prooemio Manilium" (II, 69), his notes fail to indicate that he went beyond the covers of his Stephanus edition. 19 In contrast, the Pindar annotator ranges freely beyond his volume. An instance of the "hors load of citations" that he deposits at his reader's door is a cluster of five notes entered on pages 2 and 4 concerning Olympia I, 6. The text (p. 2) reads ϕίλον ἦτορ, and the printed commentary (p. 4-5) has a six line note establishing that ϕίλος in this context is equivalent to ἵδιος and denotes "one's own." To this already adequate note, the Pindar annotator adds ten more citations or quotations from Homer, from Eustathius on Homer, and from a renaissance elegy that can have no primary authority in a question of Classical usage. Elsewhere, the Pindar annotator further supplements the printed commentary on Olympia I with quotations from or references to Lucian (p. 1), Aristotle (p. 2), Lycophron (pp. 3, 11, 35), Anacreon (p. 7), Horace (pp. 7, 10, 12, 22, 30), Virgil (p. 8), Cerda (p. 8), Tzetes (pp. 9,23), Cicero (p. 30), and Euripides (p. 35). Thus the manuscript notes on this single ode cite more works extraneous to the printed edition than we find in all of Milton's Greek marginalia. Supplementation of the scholarly apparatus, then, is the primary purpose of the Pindar annotator. To the printed commentary he adds, among other things, cross references to other Pindar odes 20 and more precise references to works already cited in the notes. 21 He returns transliterations and scriptural quotations in Latin to the original Hebrew. 22 He records or summarizes in the margin the content of the commentary. 23 To the printed index he adds omitted items or citations, 24 and on his own initiative he compiles an "Index omnium authorum qui in opere citantur, exceptis Homero et Pindari Scholiaste, quos ubique." The content of the Pindar notes thus suggests a scholar working towards a new edition or a teacher perfecting his private copy for what he considered the better instruction of his pupils. Such, then, are our reasons for questioning Milton's ownership and annotation of the Harvard Pindar. Nothing now in the volume, printed or written, indicates that Milton was associated with the volume before the 1871 sale catalogue. Pickering's argument that the notes are Milton's because the Pindar page references to Lycophron fit Milton's edition offers nothing conclusive. In fact, it provokes at least two questions that militate against Milton's authorship of the notes. If, as has been generally accepted, the Pindar entry on p. 756 (Δοξà τῷ θεῷ / Jun: 17 1630./ et Sept: 28. 1630.) 25 indicates the period of annotation, then how could Milton have referred to his copy of Lycophron, which he did not purchase until 1634? Or if the Pindar annotations belong to a period after he procured his Lycophron, then why do not the Pindar references to Euripides also fit the page numbers of Milton's copy, which he purchased in the same year as his Lycophron? Added to these difficulties are the differences in form and content revealed by comparison of the Pindar notes with the authentic Milton marginalia. The Pindar notes show different habits of annotation and handwriting and suggest scholarly interests other than those of Milton. We are therefore reluctantly forced to conclude that Milton's ownership of the Harvard Pindar has yet to be demonstrated, and that available evidence all points to a non-Miltonic origin for the annotations found therein. If we are correct in this conclusion, then the results of much laborious work — particularly by the Columbia editors and Fletcher — will have to be discarded. The Pindar annotations should not be included in future editions of Milton's work. The nature of Milton's Greek studies at Cambridge and his use of Eustathius's Homer and Vulcanius's Callimachus will have to be established on evidence other than the Pindar volume. And scholars working with the Milton manuscripts may continue to date Milton's handwriting on the basis of the form of e that it contains; or at least, the Harvard Pindar should not be invoked to question the validity of that practice.</field>

Those wishing to pursue differences into the Latin may compare the Pindar annotator's and Milton's writing of the initial consonant cluster of "Tzetzes", which the Pindar scribe (Plate II, pp. 83, 9) spells "Tzet-" and Milton (Plate III, Lyc. 174, 40) "Tset-". Another peculiarity not found in Milton's notes but frequent in the Pindar annotations is the use of "u" instead of "v". Instances of this practice, but not illustrated in our plates, are "auarus" (p. 2), "uocat" (p. 3), "uellem" (p. 8), et passim. 17 For a detailed analysis of the marginalia in this volume, see "Milton's Annotations of Aratus," PMLA , LXX (1955), 1090-1106. 18 The references to Scaliger in this volume (pp. 156, 163) derive from Canter's commentary, which is included in Milton's edition.

      <field name="heading_text">Light on Joyce's Exiles ? A New MS, a Curious Analogue, and Some Speculations by Robert M. Adams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the generosity of Mr. William Mennen, the Cornell University Library was recently able to add to its collection of James Joyce manuscripts an early version of "Ivy Day in the Committee Room"; several notebooks containing collections of materials to be used in Ulysses ; a couple of pages of the first draft of "Oxen of the Sun"; and a curious manuscript containing dialogue for Joyce's only surviving play, Exiles . This dialogue was never incorporated in the printed version of the play, a fact which seems to reduce its esthetic importance, since most of the new material bears the explicit stamp of Joyce's rejection. Yet just for this reason, it has a special value for anyone interested in the genesis and control of the issues involved in Exiles . The chance of new light on Exiles is particularly welcome because Joyce's play has so regularly baffled and frustrated admirers to whom the intricacies of Finnegans Wake seem to be mere child's play. In shape the play is a paradoxical four-cornered triangle. Its apex is a ménage similar in almost every respect to that of James and Nora Joyce and their young son Giorgio. Richard Rowan, an author, his companion Bertha, and their boy Archie, have returned to Ireland after an absence of nine years in Italy. There is a probability that Richard will be given the chair of romance literature at the university. But Bertha is subject to the menacing advances of Robert Hand, a journalist; she is also jealous of Beatrice Justice, a cousin of Robert's, for whose eyes Richard has all these years been composing his literary works. The passion of Beatrice for Richard, though fairly directly avowed in the first act, seems to break on the icy monolith of Richard's indifference. Far otherwise with the passion of Robert Hand for Bertha. He is an ardent esthete and Wildean immoralist, who pursues Bertha avidly even after he is aware that she has been reporting the details of his wooing to Richard. Richard, loth to infringe on Bertha's freedom, allows her — indeed, almost forces her — to keep an assignation with Robert, of which, naturally, they are both intensely aware that he is intensely aware. Next day Robert writes a largely laudatory article about Richard, protests innocence of any wrong doing, and retires to Surrey. Beatrice, having expressed friendship for Bertha, fades out of the play; and Richard, professing to Bertha that he will never know what happened between her and Robert, nonetheless asserts his renewed attachment to her, based on "the deep wound of doubt" which his soul has suffered. Certain of the broad aspects of this action have their roots, it is known, in biographical circumstances. Robert Hand the journalist derives a good deal of his past history from Oliver Gogarty the original of Buck Mulligan, and his interest in Bertha from Roberto Prezioso, a Triestine journalist of whose attentions to Nora Joyce, James was actively jealous (Ellmann, James Joyce , p. 327). Robert's action in writing a newspaper article expressing reserved praise of Richard Rowan derives from a similar action (in 1907) by Thomas Kettle, Joyce's schoolfellow (Ellman, JJ , p. 271). Like Richard and Bertha, Joyce and Nora returned briefly to Ireland in 1912, 8 years after leaving it; at the time of their first departure, Nora like Bertha had been an innocent girl, socially and intellectually much the inferior of her lover. Joyce had aspired in 1909 to the chair of romance literature at the National University, and Kettle had offered to help him toward the post. In all these matters, the broad outlines of the story were suggested to Joyce by his own personal history, and there are a number of lesser details which show how pervasively his personal situation was present in the world of the play. 1 But the reader's problems with Exiles are primarily problems of motivation, not of episode; they are, in fact, traceable to a persistent, pervasive haziness as to what the characters are doing, or think they are doing, to one another. We do not know for sure that Richard wants the chair of romance literature; we do not know whether Robert wants him to have it, or why. We may be certain that if Richard loves Beatrice Justice (as Bertha vigorously insists he does), it is in a pretty remote and theoretical way; but how does this love, or any other consideration involving Miss Justice, contribute to the conclusion? What is, in fact, the nature of this conclusion? It is clear that the departure of Robert represents the end of a threat; but the end of the play is by no means the triumph of true love. Richard says it is not. It is not in the darkness of belief that he now desires Bertha; he desires her "in restless living wounding doubt," and proposes (resisting all counsels of despair) to reestablish his ménage on that basis. There is a preliminary problem here as to what he is talking about; there is a further question whether, when we understand him, we can prevent him from seeming a Narcissistic prig. On all these scores, Exiles represents an outstanding piece of unfinished Joycean business; and, though we cannot expect it to clear up at a stroke, new light must be sought when and where it becomes available. The new MS, I believe, contains some. This new MS is odd in its appearance, as well as in its contents. It comprises 22 sheets of graph paper, in size about 3¼ by 4 inches, stapled loosely together in clusters. To judge from their single perforated edge, they would seem to have been torn out of a pocket note-pad. Joyce's early training in writing on the call slips of the National Library evidently resulted in a permanent sympathy for the 3x5 card. In an unusually firm, clear hand, with no changes or corrections whatever, Joyce wrote on 37 of the 44 sides of these slips the following fragments of dialogue for his play. They are here reproduced by courtesy of the Society of Authors, literary executors for the estate of James Joyce, and copyright by them. From Act II Fragment #1 Richard But in such a way — like thieves — at night — in such a place. It is not for people like us. It is not for me nor for her: it is not even for you. Robert Yes, you are right. You are so young and yet you seem to be her father and mine. I have acted like a common man. Richard When I met her first she was eighteen and since that time I have watched. I have felt her soul unfolding. Sometimes I turn to look at her in our room. I mean when I am writing. She is lying on the bed reading some book I have given her — Wagner's Letters or a novel of Jacobsen. She is struggling with sleep. You say I am like her father. Do you know what I feel then when I look at her? Robert What? Richard I feel as if I had carried her within my own body, in my womb. Robert Can a man feel like that? Richard Her books, her music, the fire of thought stolen from on high out of whose flames all ease and culture have come, the grace with which she tends the body we desire — whose work is that? I feel that it is mine. It is my work and the work of others like me now or in other times. It is we who have conceived her and brought her forth. Our minds flowing together are the womb in which we have borne her. Fragment #2 Richard You spoke of our boyhood. Since our boyhood together, our ways have been different. Robert ( Sighs ) Ah, yes. Richard You have taken the smooth path, accepting ironically everything in which you disbelieved and building for your body and for that function of it which I suppose you call your soul a peace of prudence, irony, and pleasure. Robert Are those things bad? Richard I have not chosen them. Robert I know that. As it was in my character to choose them it was in yours to reject them. Richard I have lived without prudence, risking everything, destroying everything in order to create again. Robert You will. I feel that you will. Richard I have done something already. I have destroyed and recreated in my own image a woman. Robert Bertha? Richard I carried her away with me into exile and now, after years, I carry her back again, remade in my own image. And this I did for you. Robert For me? Richard Yes, for you who risked nothing and lived prudently. Robert ( Smiling weakly ) It is a queer kind of present, Richard, like the giver. You see of course that I have no intention of accepting it. No, you have made her new and strange. She is yours. Keep her. Richard Because you are generous enough to allow me? p. 72 Fragment #3 Robert Then it was not jealousy you felt. p. 70 Richard I felt what I tell you — longing. Robert No hatred of me? But how? Richard And for all I know jealousy, as you call it, may be this longing. From Act III Fragment #4 Bertha No, thank you, Brigid. Just a cup of tea will do. Brigid Or a bit of toast? p. 91 Bertha No, thanks. Brigid Maybe it was them greengages yesterday upset your stomach, ma'am. They upsets some people that way. Bertha I suppose so. ( Brigid goes out ) Fragment #5 Bertha I wish I had never met you. Richard You would like to be freer now than you are. pp. 103-04 Bertha Yes. Richard ( Pained ) So that you could go to that house at night more freely to meet your lover. Bertha ( Putting her arms about his neck ) Yes, dear. I wish I had never met you. I wish you were my lover waiting for me there. Richard Or he? Bertha ( Shaking her head ) You, dear. I want to love you over again. I want to forget you. ( Kissing him ) Love me, Dick. Forget me and love me. Richard Have you forgotten me for him? Bertha No: I remember you. You have a different way of giving yourself to a woman — a more beautiful way than he has. ( She smooths back his hair ) Dick, never embrace her the way men do. Richard Her? Who? Bertha Beatrice. Never do. Let her remember you always as I can see you now. Richard And if she does, will you not envy her? Bertha No. I want her to remember you always and to think of you. But not like others. Because she is a fine kind of person too. Fragment #6 Robert Jealousy. Not that of common men, of course. ( With a smile ) That of Richard Rowan. Richard I effaced myself. I gave you both your freedom. I tried to feel for you and for her, to consider you both. I had only to forbid her: and I did not. I had only to say a tender word to her of — of our own past life: and I did not. I left you both free. Robert For our sakes? Richard For my own sake, do you think? Robert Would you have left us free then — nine years ago? Richard You met her often then with me and without me. Robert Would you have allowed us the same freedom then? Answer me that. Richard If she had desired you then I should have left her to you. She did not. Robert ( Quietly ) No, she did not. If she had, you would not have left her to me. At least that is not exactly the way to put it. Richard ( Simply ) No? Robert She would not have been yours to leave but mine — then. Am I right? Richard ( Turns toward him ) Yes. Robert ( Waves his hand ) That is past. But I ask you, knowing that she was yours then, would you then have given us the freedom you gave now — for our sakes? Richard Then no. Robert ( Bends across the table ) Then no. Because then only one woman was in your heart. That is why. Richard You think that now . . .? Robert Yes, I do think it. Richard Has Bertha told you? Robert I saw it without being told. I know you and I know ( he points with his thumb over his his shoulder ) my interesting if somewhat melancholy cousin. p. 109 ( He leans back in his chair, smiling . Richard rises slowly and walks to and fro, his hands at his back .) Fragment #7 Robert ( After a long silence ) Appearances are against me. Richard You mean I judge by them? Robert I mean you cannot enter into my mind. It is I who have won freedom for myself. Richard Speak out your mind. What freedom? Robert I will. Of us two it is I who am free. I have never really believed, not even as a boy. I have never wept, as you did, for my sins. I do not know what sin is. I have never believed in truth of man or woman. I have never been true myself. To what or to whom since all is chance and change? I have freed myself within and without. I care nothing for human or legal bonds or laws or moral prejudices. I do not even care to make my life fit my ideas. I live by what I disbelieve in. I do not even feel the excitement of revolt against it. And that is my greatest freedom. It is you, Richard, with all your talent, who are still the slave. Richard ( Shaken but calm ) How well I know the tempter's voice! Robert ( Nearer ) The voice of reality. She was not free even last night. The shadow of her fear of you was over her. You have not healed your soul. You have wounded it — a deep wound of doubt which neither her words nor mine can heal completely. Richard Is it not at least as noble to fight on in doubt as in faith? Robert It may be nobler. I still admire the noble friend in you and love him all the more since I see that he also is the victim of a delusion. Richard Delusion! Because I believe in myself — and in her? Robert Because, Richard, I see that your type is not, as you wish to believe, the type of the humanity which will come after us. Richard But you are that type — is that your delusion? Robert I am not — wholly. Richard Who then? Robert Perhaps — your son. Your creedless lawless fearless son. Richard ( Slowly ) Archie! . . . . And you? Robert I am his godfather. ( He takes his hat from the table .) Richard ( Repeats ) Perhaps. Robert I said perhaps because he is yours. I could say almost surely if . . . . Richard If . . .? Robert ( With a smile ) If he were mine. Fragment #8 Bertha ( Putting her arm about his waist ) I have been true to you, Dick, have I not? pp. 110-11 Richard ( Smiling ) You know that best yourself. Bertha ( Averting her eyes ) I have been. Very true. I gave you myself. You took me and you left me. Richard Left you! Bertha You left me: and I waited for you to come back to me. Richard ( Disturbed ) Yes, I know what you mean. Bertha O, Dick, those long evenings in Rome, what I went through! Do you remember the terrace on the top of the house where we lived? Richard Yes. Bertha I used to sit there, waiting, with the poor child playing with his toys, waiting until he got sleepy. I could see all over the city, the sun setting and right under me the river, the Tevere . What is it called in English? I forget. Richard The Tiber. Bertha Yes. It was lovely, Dick, only for I was so sad. I was alone, forgotten by you and by all. You had grown tired of me because I was too simple and uneducated for a person like you. I thought my life was over and yours too. Richard It had not begun. Bertha And I used to look at the sky, so beautiful, without a cloud, and at the city you said was so old. It was all something high and beautiful. But it made me cry. Richard Why, dear? Bertha Because I was so uneducated. I knew nothing about all those things. And still I was moved by them. Fragment #9 Richard I suffered too. Bertha But not like I did, Dick. Richard Yes. I know what you felt. That I was giving to another the finer part of myself and only what was gross to you. Bertha I could not bear that. I tried to understand everything in your strange character. But that no. Richard I saw it in your eyes, a vague fear, the fear of life. I heard it in your voice, your wonder. You were asking yourself what was this thing in life, in love itself; and you were praying almost in your heart that it might not come, even that life or love might die before it came. Bertha ( Pointing to her breast ) In there, dear. In my heart I felt something breaking. That you saw in my eyes. Richard ( Seizing her hands, kisses her passionately ) O, how I loved you then! My little bride! My little bride in exile! Bertha Am I useful to you in your life, dear, in something? Richard ( Laughing, shakes his head ) No quite useless! Bertha Ah, tell me! I want to know. Fragment #10 Bertha When you said goodnight to me I knew by your voice you wanted to be alone. I felt so sad then, Richard. Your lips when you kissed me were so soft and cold. I could not speak to you as if the world were between us. And when I was in bed, alone in the room, in the silence and saw the little lamp burning on the washstand I thought of my girlhood. Richard ( Tenderly ) Tell me more, dearest. Bertha I thought I was in the room I used to sleep in when I was a girl, that I had never been in a man's arms, that I was still innocent and young. I was innocent when I met you first, Richard, was I not? Richard ( Touching her sleeve with his lips ) Always, always. Bertha I thought I was in that room and I could see it, the little oil-lamp burning quietly near my bed, and on the wall I could see the picture of Robert Emmet that used to be on the wall. You know? In a green uniform, with his hat off, with dark eyes. Then . . . Richard Then? Bertha Then I thought of Robert. I felt you were gone away and would never come back to me. I felt you were not thinking of me but of her and perhaps he was. I felt lonely for someone. Richard How did you think of him? Bertha His name, his eyes, and how his voice is when he says my name. I was glad to think that he sleeps alone: and I said his name to myself softly thinking perhaps he might hear me someway. Richard ( Walks to and fro a little in silence, then standing near her ) Bertha! Bertha What? Richard Did you feel then that you were beginning to love him? Tell me the truth. Bertha ( Simply ) No. I loved you. Richard Even then? Bertha I felt I had lost you. I could not understand why. It was useless to think what it meant. You were lost for me. Fragment #11: unplaceable Richard What you wished has taken place — and what I wished. In this cage when events were in our power we cannot blame them. Some of the phrases in these fragments will be familiar to readers of Exiles , and one extended passage (fragment #8) can be discovered, almost verbatim, in the concluding dialogue of Richard and Bertha. Most of the other fragments can be located, hypothetically and approximately, within the structure of the play, either by the characters who are engaged in conversation, by the attitudes they display, by the circumstances of their discussions, or by verbal parallels with the final text. Except for the final fragment, which is too short to locate any-where in the play, I have arranged them in a provisional order. None seem to relate to the first act, three relate to the second, and all the rest to the third. Wherever a phrase carries over to the final text of the play, I have added a marginal page-reference to the Viking 1951 edition, with foreword by Padraic Colum. The two fragments which, according to this estimate of their position within the play come first, are the most interesting of the manuscript. In both of them, Richard Rowan explains to Robert Hand (speaking with more intimacy and greater confidence of being understood than he ever displays toward Robert in the final text) that he is the creator of Bertha. He has destroyed her, he says (not without a touch of arrogance), and recreated her; he has borne her in the womb, nurtured and fostered and created both her mind and "the grace with which she tends the body we desire." He is not only her father but also, with his fellow culture-heroes, her mother. This is of course a familiar and beloved metaphor of Joyce's; it is the deepest and most intimate human connection he can envisage. But Richard Rowan's creation of Bertha has also an echo of a larger and more ambitious enterprise. He claims to have created a woman and perhaps a work of art; it seems probable that in his own mind, and in Joyce's as well, he has created, i.e., forged, something like the conscience of his race, which he is now testing against Robert, the gay deceiver. To forge such a conscience was the resolve of Stephen Dedalus, at the end of the Portrait ; the applicability of the notion is reinforced by Joyce's habit of referring to Nora as "Ireland" or "his little Ireland," and given extra dimension by an important phrase of Stephen's, in Ulysses , to the effect that Ireland must be important because it belongs to him (p. 629). It is a revealing and important paradox which Joyce adopted from Mallarmé that "tout existe pour aboutir à un livre"; in some sense, Bertha is undergoing precisely this interesting metamorphosis. If the forging of Bertha's consciousness be taken as microcosmically equivalent to the recreation of the Irish conscience, a major part of the play then centers on the pun implicit in the word "forge." To what degree has Richard shaped Bertha's mind, to what degree has he faked it? A secondary question, more difficult of resolution, involves the extent to which Richard can claim to have done all this "for Robert." It is possible that he is thinking of Robert under the aspect of an audience for his literary work; but would this imply a categorical equation of artistic appreciation with the act of adultery? I should hope not. Very likely we shall want to suppose that Robert is here being treated as a type, not an individual; perhaps only as a quality of mind. The contemptuous emphasis on prudence would tend to identify him with Bloom, as Richard identifies naturally with Stephen. But the fragment is by no means clear. We are probably on safer ground in noting an additional emphasis laid on the notion of exile in both these fragments. It is a notion puzzlingly unexplored in the play proper. Richard and Bertha have been abroad for nine years, but the theme of exile has little apparent bearing on the conflict of Richard with Robert for the possession of Bertha. Now we see that Bertha is a new creation of Richard's, that Robert is not pursuing an old flame but trying to deprive Richard of that one substitute Ireland which he has himself created (and which has, reciprocally, made a man of him: p. 100); and now the theme of exile takes on a relation to the play's central conflict which was never made explicit in its final version. Robert is trying to re-exile Richard, to uncrown him in the kingdom of his imagination. The deep wound of doubt from which Richard is suffering at the end of the play thus transcends the mere matter of whether Bertha has in fact acted, or wanted to act, adulterously with Robert; it is a question of extraordinary rights which he has usurped over her soul, of a situation where he is both Adam and God the Father, while Bertha is Eve, and Robert the Tempter. At the root of Richard's predicament is that ancient paradox reduced to a nutshell by Milton: can a human creature really be created "sufficient to have stood though free to fall"? The wound of doubt which assails Richard may involve, among other things, the question whether he had any right to assume the position of God the Father vis à vis Bertha; it would, understandably, be inflamed by the discovery that he is slipping into the same position vis à vis Beatrice, and would culminate in the act of mental abdication with which the play in fact concludes. But, curious as they are in relation to the psychology of Joyce and no doubt of Richard Rowan, the passages were quite properly excised from the finished play. All episodes involving a man's attempt to remake a woman according to some learned ideal of his own invite the sort of mockery that reverberates through L'Ecole des Femmes , and Richard Rowan is easy enough to laugh at, as the play stands. The anger of Bertha at being manipulated by Richard in her relation to Robert may derive from her consciousness of owing so much to him — as his resentment of her derives from a contrast of her innocence with his experience. And, I venture to think, her odd, provocative indifference to Robert's wooing (as well as her calm, detached recital of its episodes to Richard) may well survive from a stage in the drafting of the play when the idea of her being a "made" personality bulked larger than it does in the final version. Fragment #5 explains something which is mildly enigmatic in the text, as the play's text is printed. Richard accuses Bertha of wanting to be free so that she can meet her lover. Speaking in intense passion, she cries "To meet my lover! My lover! Yes! My lover" — and bursts into tears. Richard tries to comfort her, but she declares that he is a stranger to her; and at this point, Robert enters and she departs. The softer version of this scene, represented in the fragment, makes clear this somewhat theatrical misunderstanding; he thinks that the words "your lover" mean Robert Hand to her; she knows that they mean Richard himself. Her fidelity to Richard is therefore more firmly established than the final text ever allows it to be; and the paradox of their wishing to forget one another in order to love one another more freshly reaches back from Bertha's last speech to establish itself as a basic theme of the drama. It is the virginity of the soul that she wishes to recover. On the other hand, her feeling that with Richard this virginity is only to be recovered by an act of oblivion contrasts interestingly with Robert's assurance (p. 106 of the text) that only the dream he shared with Bertha during "that sacred night of love" is a real element in his life. These spiritual acrobatics, carried on by her two rhetorical lovers, place Bertha in a somewhat puzzling position; she is in a fair way to being overwhelmed with willful acts of remembering and forgetting. At the same time, this fragment shows us that Bertha's reconcilement with Beatrice is not meant to be the mere surface sympathy of women in trouble; indeed, it adds an extra dimension to the matter of remembering when we see how Bertha's jealousy of Beatrice imperceptibly converts into a desire to have her remember Richard. It is almost as if remembering were a substitute for possession — a point which may well have future implications. Fragments #6 and #7 I have assigned to that scene in the third act wherein Robert confronts Richard. Both fragments clearly take place after, and make reference to, Bertha's assignation with Robert, with which Act Two concludes. The central point of Fragment #6 is the revival and apparent confirmation of Bertha's charge that Richard is really in love with Beatrice Justice, for whose eyes and judgment he has been writing all these years. Miss Justice, recently jilted after a secret engagement by Robert Hand, her first cousin, is the daughter of a Protestant convert (or pervert, as one will) residing in Youghal, is a Protestant herself, and a lifelong convalescent. In brief, she is intricately entangled in the circumstance of the play and only slightly integrated with its action. If Richard is really in love with her, the impression is very ill conveyed. She is clearly fascinated by him, and says so (p. 19) almost at once; her eagerness to give Archie his music lesson, though she has forgotten to bring any music (p. 29), points in the same direction. Though secretly — why secretly? — engaged to Robert Hand (whose type she scarcely seems to be), she has been acting — also secretly — as Richard's literary confidante for nine years, that is, since before the breaking of her engagement. But Robert evinces no awareness of this, offers no explanation for the breaking of his engagement, and, though ready to accuse Richard of loving Beatrice, does not see or say that this affects him except as it liberates Bertha. Miss Justice is evidently a diaphanous as well as a puzzling person, whether one takes her as representative of something outside the play, or as an artifact designed to elicit certain effects within it. The extra emphasis laid on her relation to Richard by this fragment calls attention to the extraordinary number of loose ends in her character, and to our sense of how little is resolved in her relations with Robert and Richard. She reaches a sort of understanding with Bertha, but allows the abortive declaration to Richard (by which he is still greatly disturbed at the end of Act III) to fade off without any effort at resolution; and she takes no position on the Richard-Robert dispute beyond the nice, pathetic wish that they shall get along together. The fragment suggests that Joyce's third act once tried to have Robert and Richard work out between them their relations to enigmatic Miss Justice, but that the puzzle proved too intricate for dramatic effectiveness, and so Miss Justice was allowed to fade quietly out of the play. Her relation to the action has some undramatic aspects to which we will recur later on. Fragment #7 confirms a suspicion that the basic theme of the play is a conflict over the past and the future, between the principled person who remembers and the unprincipled person, who forgets. In notes for the play, reprinted by Colum (p. 117), Joyce listed as one of his problems the fact that "Archie, Richard's son, is brought up on Robert's principles"; the notion is spelled out here in the three adjectives "creedless, lawless, fearless," so that there is no mistaking the point which is represented in the text chiefly by Archie's eagerness to drive the milkman's horse. Thus Robert's relation of godfather to Archie reinforces a thematic point; and the departure of these bold, free spirits (p. 110) — perhaps to carry on the work of the next generation — leaves Richard and Bertha to explore the wound of doubt and remembrance for which the only healing salve is oblivion. Fragment #8, closest to an extended passage of text, differs from it in making Bertha confess a cultural backwardness, scarcely compatible with the perusal of Wagner's Letters and the novels of Jacobsen (Fragment #1), but no doubt accurate in its relation to Nora Barnacle Joyce. The special quality of Fragment #9 is a sliding series of imperceptible metamorphoses. Richard's notion that he has been "giving another the finer part of myself and only what was gross to you" must point toward his intellectual correspondence with Beatrice, his physical relation with Bertha. Bertha's jealousy of Beatrice becomes, puzzlingly, "a fear of life," and the memory of how he "broke her heart" with this fear rouses Richard to a paroxysm of affection. But when she tries to draw from this circumstance the pathetically mild comfort that she is of some use to him in his work, he puts her off with an irony. A major element in the scene is apparently Richard's cruelty toward Bertha, the element of sadism within his apparently masochistic jealousy. This is a good deal for an audience in an actual playhouse, confronted with a passing spectacle, to grasp; it also detracts sharply from our sympathy with Richard, and, no doubt on these scores, the scene was reduced almost to the point of elimination from the play. Finally, the special interest of Fragment #10 is scarcely artistic at all, since almost every trace of it has been eliminated from the finished script. But it does show how those association-patterns which Joyce worked out in the notes toward the play (dated 12 and 13 November, 1913; Colum, pp. 117-118) were first intended to find application. Bertha's innocence and girlishness, associated with the naiveté of Irish political life and the naturalness of Irish rural existence, were to appear within the play as memories of childhood scenes. Bertha was evidently to be a character deeply rooted in the Irish soil, as Robert and Richard clearly are not. Indeed, she is a forerunner of Molly Bloom in representing the earth itself; in fulfillment of this notion, her colors are pale green, lavender, and cream, and she moves in what Robert perceptively describes under the imagery of a lunar cycle. The delicate sensuality of this presentation was evidently muted to make way for the intricate dialectic of the later acts; and so these materials dropped out of the play. Before trying to say what all this adds up to, one should probably take account of a buried piling on which Joyce's play seems to have been constructed; this is Scribe's libretto for Meyerbeer's opera, Robert le Diable . As a piece of stagecraft, Scribe's piece is a juvenile shocker in the lowest traditions of Victorian melodrama. The main features of its action may be summarized, with brutal but merited abruptness, as follows: Robert, duke of Normandy, has been exiled to Sicily by his ungrateful compatriots; and the story is told that he is the son of Bertha, daughter of a prince of Normandy, by no less a lover than the devil. Robert is in love with Isabella, princess of Sicily, whose hand he hopes to win with the aid of his dear friend, Bertram. Bertram, however, is not really a very good friend; he entices Robert into a dice game where he loses all his armor, and then when Isabella re-arms him, Bertram tells our simple-minded hero that the Prince of Grenade, his chief rival, has sent him a challenge. While Robert is seeking the Prince in a bosky dell nearby, the tourney is held, Robert is absent, and the Prince of Grenade wins the hand of Isabella. Bertram now offers to lead unsuspicious Robert to a magic branch which he must sacrilegiously pluck from the tomb of Saint Rosalie in an abandoned nunnery. Unaware that the nuns whom he sees are evil spirits, and that the nunnery is a haunt of devils, Robert plucks the sacred branch and uses its magic to force his way into the bedroom of Isabella. But her eloquent pleas recall him to his better nature, he resigns his evil power by breaking the branch, her guards awake from their magic sleep, and Robert is led off to prison. Finally, in Act V, Bertram confesses that he is really the devil, and so Robert's father; the Prince of Grenade was only one of his agents, and so can be made to disappear at command. Bertram assures Robert that he will have no rival for the hand of Isabella if he enlists in the diabolic camp. Seduced by this offer, Robert is about to opt for hell and Isabella when Alice, his half-sister, arrives, bearing their sainted mother's will. Read, it proves to be a warning against the devil. Robert repents, Bertram disappears in a thunderclap, the Prince of Grenade is repelled by the powers of holiness from the Cathedral in Palermo where Isabella is waiting impatiently for a husband — any husband — and the curtain falls on a vision of the Cathedral, Isabella and the pious populace at prayer, with an empty seat beside her, destined for Robert. Aside from the names Robert and Bertha, two or three points of narrative similarity with Exiles strike the eye immediately. Scribe's Robert is in exile and he grieves that he could not perform his final filial duties for his dying mother. The theme of false friendship is central to both plays; Bertram, like Robert Hand, professes freedom to change, freedom from law, creed, and principle. In pursuit of this freedom, he seeks to betray his friend (and also to destroy his son), while professing sincere affection for him. An air sung by this most interesting and ambiguous devil in Act V sets forth his odd double motivation: Ton malheur, ô mon fils ! n'égalera le mien. Notre tourment à nous, c'est de vivre insensible, De ne pouvoir aimer, de n'aimer jamais rien. Tel est l'enfer. Eh bien ! quand le souverain maître Eut lancé dans l'abîme un ange révolté, Dans mon coeur un instant le repentir vint naître; Et ce Dieu dans sa bonté, Dans sa vengeance peut-être, Me permit d'aimer ! Oui, depuis ce jour cruel, Oui, par toi seul, Robert, mon coeur a pu connaître Les craintes, le bonheur, les tourments d'un mortel; Et toi seul à présent es ma vie et mon être. O mon fils ! ô Robert ! ô mon unique bien ! D'un seul mot va dépendre et ton sort et le mien ! Je t'ai trompé, je fus coupable; Tu sauras tout: avant minuit, Si tu n'as pas signé ce pacte irrévocable Qui pour l'éternité tous les deux nous unit, Ce Dieu qui me poursuit, ce Dieu qui nous accable, Reprend sur toi tout son pouvoir; Je te perds à jamais, je ne dois plus te voir ! Minuit ! . . . minuit ! . . . tel est son arrêt immuable . . . O mon fils ! ô Robert! ô mon unique bien ! De ce mot va dépendre et ton sort et le mien ! Et ne crois pas qu'ici je veuille te séduire. C'est pour ton seul bonheur qu'à présent je respire; Et si ce bonheur même est ailleurs qu'avec moi, Va . . . fuis . . . Je t'aime assez pour renoncer à toi ! He is both self-seeking and self-sacrificial, this unusual devil; and the crucial turn of his relation with his friend-son concerns Isabella, the princess whom Robert has learned to love in exile. Alice, who in the opera is Robert's half-sister, may well correspond to Beatrice who in the play is Robert's first cousin. To be sure, there is a sort of uncertainty in Joyce's play over who really is the devil; Robert seems to be the spirit of clever negation, and in Fragment #7 Richard refers to him as the Tempter; but in Scribe's script, it is the friend of Robert who is really the devil. Does this imply that in Joyce's play the final effect is a reversal of roles, with Richard becoming the devil that Robert has been wrongly accused of being? There are some grounds for arguing the matter (we have seen, in one of the fragments, Richard taking on some of Robert's sadism; and we know that the role of Satan was one which appealed to Joyce from earliest days: cf. Stanislaus Joyce, My Brother's Keeper , p. 3); to put the matter at its mildest, the final effect in both pieces is of an unusual confusion, if not interchange of roles. One notes that even God, in Scribe's piece, is ambiguous; his gift of love to Bertram may be an act either of benevolence or vengeance. It would be idle to draw attention to these slightly strained similarities without conceding immediately the enormous differences between Joyce's play and Scribe's script. The similarities are largely skeletal, admittedly. But this is precisely the way in which Joyce enjoyed adapting old pieces, as inversion and parody are ways in which he altered the tone and content to suit his own temperament. And even in a local context, the parallel may explain an occasional odd feature of Joyce's play. For example, Richard, while walking on the strand overnight, reports emphatically that he has heard demons jabbering out there; this is just the period in the opera when Robert visits the haunted nunnery. Even parallels which seem superficially absurd may have definite symbolic import; for example, it is mad to suppose that Joyce intended to suggest that Robert is really the son of Richard and Bertha (as Robert in the opera is really the son of Bertram and Bertha); yet, within Exiles , there is undeniably a certain amount of teasing byplay over Archie, who is Richard's son and Robert's godson, whose temper in its bold gaiety and unbelief is Robert's, and who, like Robert-le-Diable, is a bastard. This teasing is reinforced and augmented in Fragment #7. It is surely a conscious irony of the play that Richard, in rejecting the conventions for which Robert (despite his disbelief) stands, has begotten another Robert. But though the parallel with Scribe renders less odd some passages and concepts in Joyce's play which would otherwise be very odd indeed, I do not by any means put it forward as the "clou" to Joyce's puzzling and intricate drama. In some ways, it renders the play even more indigestible than it was before, notably by adding a supernatural dimension to it. The cold arrogance of Richard Rowan is Promethean, even Luciferian; what then does it mean that Miss Beatrice Justice is infatuated with him? Conceding that her patronymic has some symbolic import, just what is it? Robert Hand, departing to visit his cousin in Surrey, makes some point of referring to him, not as John, but Jack, otherwise "Doggy" Justice. This can scarcely be other than contemptuous mockery; just as in Act III, the fishwoman's cry from offstage, "Fresh Dublin bay herrings!" is used to deride Robert's final assurances and protestations of friendship for Richard. But if justice is being derided in Joyce's play, what principle is being upheld? The indications are very carefully mixed. Joyce attached importance to details as slight as Bertha's cream gloves and Beatrice's glasses; 2 but he did not render very distinct the final adjustments — sentimental, spiritual, ideological — of the ladies to the gentlemen, or of the ladies and the gentlemen to one another. This indecision is so carefully sustained, and bulks so large in the play, that it can scarcely be other than deliberate; hence one looks in vain, either in Scribe or Ibsen or any other formal source, for resolutions of an irresolution which is functional to the specific drama of Exiles . What we need is a better definition of the play's issues than we have yet had. I do not flatter myself that I have such a definition up my sleeve, but some things can perhaps be attempted. Let us begin with the simpleminded observation that Richard and Robert have names beginning with the same letter, as do Bertha and Beatrice. Without committing ourselves permanently to the thesis that each alphabetic pair represents a single personality, let us consider the possibility. The relation existing between Shem and Shaun, in Finnegans Wake , is a sort of paradigm for the one I would propose between Robert and Richard, Bertha and Beatrice. Shem and Shaun are of course perfectly distinct characters, indeed, they are elaborately distinguished; but the more lines of cleavage one establishes between them, the more one feels that they are complements, not disparates. Their very differences serve to unite them. They are mirror-images of one another, positive and negative prints of the same picture. Both include important elements of Joyce himself, as well as of their father, HCE. So it is in several important matters with Robert and Richard. Robert is a journalist, Richard an artist; but Joyce was both. Richard is arrogant, Robert ignoble; and Joyce thought of himself as both. Richard appeals to Bertha through his strength and strangeness, Robert through his weakness and familiarity; and Joyce's relation with Nora encompassed both contraries. Richard is the father of Archie, but Robert is his godfather, that is, his spiritual prototype. In almost all its details the relation between Bertha and Richard is that between Nora and James Joyce; yet Robert is allowed to describe Bertha's face, in a metaphor which recurs several times in Joyce's letters to Nora, as "a wild flower blowing in a hedge" (p. 32). Robert, a hard-burning Paterian esthete, professes ardent and lawless passion for the beautiful; Richard is the creator of that beauty which Robert adores. The list of antinomies could be extended indefinitely. As Joyce could scarcely have been unaware, this pair of contrasting characters, divided irreconcilably between the acquisitive and ethical stadia, is a regular feature of the Ibsen drama; seen through a multitude of different personae in different dramas, it is the single essential difference between Peer Gynt and Brand. On these terms, Joyce's drama falls into a clear, though unresolved and necessarily inconclusive pattern. The severe and demanding mind of Richard Rowan, Shelleyan in its extra-humanitarian focus, finds people of interest as they belong to it; the docile and well-trained mind of Robert Hand expresses its resentment before a superior power by inflicting the deep wound of doubt. Robert's mind falls into its natural relation to Richard's when it coöpts without acknowledgmement his phrase from Duns Scotus (pp. 68, 108); it takes its natural revenge in the too-obvious and too-easy assurances (pp. 106-107) that nothing has happened. The issue between the men is less sexual possession of a woman than two contrasting ways of seeing Ireland and the world; which of them, they agree in asking, is the "type of the future"? In this conflict, they are predestined destroyers of one another's assurance. As between Beatrice, who is spiritual love in the Dantesque form always rather unsatisfactory to Joyce, and Bertha, who is the sacramental ignorance of earth as well as a work of Richard's art, opposition is less acute. Beatrice is almost absorbed into Bertha in the final benediction, as prudence and justice, the copybook virtues, give way to a darker, more passionate relation, that between the artist and his creation. Though rather sad things happen when we try to turn the play into a fullblown Spenserian allegory, there may be some advantage to the notion that neither Robert Hand nor Beatrice Justice is quite intended to represent a three-dimensional person. If each is in the nature of an imago, conjured up by the opposite partner out of the strains and tensions of a devouring, demanding relationship, their limitations as theatrical personages may be easier to accept. The watery insubstantiality of Beatrice, the somewhat stagy wickedness of Robert, may then be meaningful; their kinship and their broken engagement are less realistic details than symbolic attributes of a temperament, an order of reality, perhaps a social discipline. Youghal, ancient seat of English power in England, was a center of that doggy justice to which prudent Robert, at the end of the play, is prudently turning. Beatrice is to remember Richard, as Robert swears to remember Bertha, because in this way the relation of Richard and Bertha (who in their "infidelities" have really only been seeking themselves) can be enriched and completed. In their direct relation to one another, on the other hand, Richard and Bertha must perpetually forget in order perpetually to rediscover. So conceived, the play deals with what Freud in one of his most brilliant paradoxes described as the participation, in every sexual relation, of four persons. The fact that Richard resolves to hold Bertha, not in the security of assurance, but in the bonds of a restless living wounding doubt, bears witness to a new inwardness and a new passivity on his part. The infidelity he fears and partly courts is an inescapable consequence of his word finding flesh, of incarnation; in the new relation, he will no longer be God the Father, but rather Joseph the cuckold, perhaps the child in the womb. Having made him a man, Bertha must now cherish him as a child; having created his work of art, the artist must now suffer it to create him. Biographically, Joyce's need to be enveloped and mothered was as deep as his need to dominate; and Richard Rowan mirrors his creator faithfully in this respect. Though armored in his vocation, Richard is forever vulnerable in his creation, from which, in the conscious mind, he is forever alienated. But, dismissing English-Protestant moralities and immoralities, he seeks the unconscious, intuitive communion of blood and doubt with which the play closes. To describe Exiles in these schematic terms is to oversimplify it, of course, even to destroy its peculiar energy; for Richard Rowan's ultimate doubt is involved in the play's total structure. He is afflicted with a doubt of Bertha, of Robert, of Beatrice, of himself, and probably of Archie; the spectators who have followed with anything like sympathy this alarming descent into anguish can scarcely be allowed to feel secure in the possession of this or any other final esthetic truth about the spectacle. It is hard to see how Angst can be credibly portrayed unless it is in some rather direct way created. As the characters play cat and mouse with one another, the author plays the same game with the reader-viewer. There are, thus, elements in the play which no trim outline will accommodate, autobiographical and associative details which no possible formal pattern can relate or explain. To entangle and defeat the conscious mind in order to release its deeper levels of passion and perception is the pattern of Exiles , as of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake . Without a sense of long frustration, there would be none of sudden liberation. But I doubt that we are in imminent danger of destroying the play through understanding it too early or too well. One last set of considerations arising from the bibliographic peculiarities of the manuscript. The remarkable cleanness of the script, which contains no erasures, insertions, or alternative readings, suggests that we have, not a primitive version of the play, but a set of relatively late variations on its themes. Within their limits, the dialogues are complete and consecutive; there is nothing tentative or exploratory about them. They involve both mechanical stage business ("them greengages") and significant analyses of important thematic relations. Joyce's notesheets and workshops, which exist in profusion for Ulysses and Finnegans Wake , never have so tight and tidy an appearance as these bits of dialogue. If we suppose that Joyce wrote Exiles by allowing the dialogue to flower almost without conscious control from a central situation, and by then paring down or rounding off excrescences to form an acting script (this would be in line with his compositional procedures elsewhere), is it not possible that two separate forms of the play came to exist? One would be the script as acted and printed; the other — fuller, more personal, and less tightly woven into dramatic shape; created as fetish, as self-analysis, as personal confession, but not as a work of art — would be represented by the fragments of MS at Cornell. The one is a public, the other a private version of the same play. On these terms, would not the "private" version have special authority as a gloss on the "public" one? It might serve, particularly, to show that the artist never asserted that absolute autonomous rule over his materials which entitles us to suppose that all conflicts within the work of art can and should be resolved. On these terms, Exiles is a drama written for two stages simultaneously, and so compromised ab ovo . It can't be understood with the mind alone; one of its modes of truth is autobiographical, and for this mode of understanding we shall always and inevitably lack essential materials.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The boy Archie, for example, calls Richard "babbo" as Giorgio Joyce referred to his father; he recalls thievery in Rome, where Joyce had been robbed; Joyce, like Richard, received from his wife detailed daily reports on her admirer's advances; Richard has had a merry father and a solemn mother, from whom he was alienated at the time of her death; he wears glasses like Joyce, writes books which (like Joyce's) don't sell in Dublin; and is described, by Brigid, as arrogant with the upper classes but delighting in familiar gossip with the humble. Phrases like "he thinks the sun shines out of your face" (p. 90) and "your face is a wild flower blowing in a hedge" (p. 32) derive from Joyce's personal correspondence in very personal contexts indeed. 2 The fact that Richard and Beatrice, the "intellectuals" of the play, are pronouncedly nearsighted probably makes an ironic point against the conscious mind. They are also the coolest and most reserved of the couples, as the most deeply alienated from the life of the senses. According to Joyce's feelings, they would thereby qualify for an extra measure of compassion.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Further Observations on the Text of Dubliners by Robert Scholes *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This essay is a continuation of a study begun in Studies in Bibliography , XV (1962), 191-205. In the first essay, on the basis of an examination of the various manuscripts and proofs of one story, "The Dead," I attempted to establish a rationale for the textual criticism of Dubliners . In brief, and without the supporting evidence, the rationale is this: The first complete printing of Dubliners was done by the firm of Falconer in Dublin in 1910 for a projected edition to be published by Maunsel and Company. This printing went through three states: 1) a set of galleys, printed from Joyce's holograph manuscript but including many compositorial "improvements" in punctuation (including about one thousand additional commas); 2) a set of early page proofs, somewhat more correct than the galleys; 3) a set of printed pages (referred to as a "late stage" of the printing in these studies but almost certainly the final stage, ready for the binder) thoroughly corrected by Joyce and containing some new improvements to the text made by him in proof-reading. When the Dublin publisher and printer finally refused to publish the book, Joyce obtained a set of the early page proofs (the second state described above), which became the printer's copy for the actual First Edition published by Grant Richards in 1914. There are two states of the printing of this edition. The Edinburgh printer, The Riverside Press, eliminated the galley stage and provided a set of page proofs for correction. Having been set from the quite incorrect early page proofs of the abortive Dublin printing, these proofs required considerable correction. They were sent to Joyce, who made his corrections hastily, expecting to see another set of proofs. When the other proofs were not sent to him, he forwarded a set of corrections which he hoped would be made. It was not until two years later that he discovered that not only had the thirty additional corrections not been made but that two hundred of the original corrections indicated on the page proofs had not been made either. The second state of the Grant Richards edition is the First Edition itself. Modern reprint texts of Dubliners differ from this only by a few proof-reader's corrections and some new compositor's errors introduced into the text. For this second study of the text of Dubliners I have examined and collated all the available manuscript and proof versions of all the stories not treated in my first study — that is, all but "The Dead." Since the materials available for study vary from story to story, each will be treated separately below, after a discussion of the general problems which will face the future editor of Dubliners .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">General Problems One of the major problems for the future editor of Dubliners will be the punctuation of the text. He will certainly want to return to Joyce's own desired punctuation of direct discourse (dashes instead of quotation marks); but will he want to follow Joyce's habitual MS procedure and place a dash both before and after a paragraph in which direct discourse appears, or will he adopt the procedure of the published versions of Portrait and Ulysses and use the opening dash only? I am inclined to favor the latter, as representing Joyce's final procedure — but the question is certainly arguable. The use of commas will present another problem of considerable complexity, owing to the bizarre pre-publication printing history of the book. The compositor of the Maunsel (Dublin) printing added about one thousand commas to Joyce's text. In "A Mother," for example, where we have a full set of galley proofs to examine, we find that the galleys have 87 more commas than the MS from which they were set. The Grant Richards page proofs for the first edition (which were set from page proofs of the Maunsel printing) show that 70 commas were removed between the galleys and the Richards page proofs, and we find that 12 more were expunged for the first edition itself. But some of the total of 82 expunged commas were present in Joyce's MS, and a number of compositorial commas which were not in the MS have been allowed to stand in the text. Should the editor go back to MS or allow the final version to stand, as having been proof-read by Joyce and therefore carrying his approval? We cannot be sure which readings in the first edition are among the 200 corrections Joyce wanted to make, but the existence of 200 errors certainly undermines our confidence in the first edition. Still, Joyce was given to continual revising in proof, a habit which prevents us from accepting with absolute confidence a manuscript reading over a reading in the first edition. Each case will have to be decided individually by an editor who is deeply familiar with Joyce's habits of punctuation and is willing to proceed eclectically, relying on his judgment. There will also be problems in substantive readings for the future editor of Dubliners . The question of "lost" improvements in the late stage of the Maunsel (Dublin) text has been considered in my earlier essay (and some additional material of this kind will be presented below) but there are questions even more complex than this which the editor will have to face. The final MS of "Ivy Day in the Committee Room," for example, which was the printer's copy for the Maunsel (Dublin) printing, bears a number of marginal corrections in Joyce's hand. Some of these marginal corrections appear in the page proofs and finally in the first edition; others seem never to have been printed. (They might, however, have been incorporated into the final Dublin state, of which, for this story, there is no known copy.) Here again, and in other similar cases, the editor will have to rely on his critical judgment and decide whether Joyce thought the better of his marginal improvement and deliberately omitted to include it in the printed text, or he simply lost track of it, and now the editor must execute Joyce's long-delayed intention. All this suggests a generalization about the problems of an editor in relation to bibliographical theory. It seems that no theory of textual transmission, however carefully and thoroughly worked out, will absolve the editor from using his judgment and his critical faculty. He will have to take risks. In the present instance we have an unusual amount of material available. What would we not give to have two MS and two proof texts for one of Shakespeare's plays (as we have them for "Ivy Day in the Committee Room")? But even such a miraculous acquisition as this would probably leave the text of the play a long way from settled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Individual Stories "The Sisters" Date of composition: This was the first story of Dubliners to be written. It appeared in the Irish Homestead on 13 August 1904. Joyce revised it slightly in June 1905 for submission to Grant Richards, and revised it extensively before submission to Maunsel in April 1909. Texts available: 1) Published Irish Homestead text; 2) 1905 MS; 3) revised MS, used for Maunsel printing; 4) late stage of Maunsel page proofs; 5) Grant Richards page proofs; 6) First Edition. The development of the final text: This aspect of "The Sisters" has been treated thoroughly by Marvin Magalaner in Joyce, The Man, the Work, the Reputation , (1962), pp. 82-87; and Time of Apprenticeship (1959), pp. 74-86. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: The two major changes from manuscript in the late stage of the Maunsel text which were not picked up in the Richards text seem of slight importance: a) "We crossed ourselves and came away." (First Edition, p. 16; Viking Compass Edition, p. 14; Jonathan Cape (1954), p. 13) "We blessed ourselves and came away." (late Maunsel, p. 10. The MS reads "crossed". This change must have been made in the late Maunsel only.) b) ". . . she filled out the sherry . . . ." (FE., p. 16; VC, p. 15; JC, p. 13) ". . . she poured out the sherry . . . ." (late Maunsel only, p. 10) "An Encounter" Date of composition: The ninth in order of composition, this story was completed by mid-September 1905. Texts available: 1) MS for Maunsel printing; 2) late stage of Maunsel printing; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. The development of the text: The MS and page proofs show that Joyce continued correcting and improving right up to the end, but most of these changes are small — a word or two at most. The eyes of the peculiar stranger were "sage-green" in the MS and only acquired their more sinister "bottle-green" hue in the Irish proofs. This improvement was not lost in the Richards text, but a few were and are listed below. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: a) ". . . some wretched fellow that writes these things for a drink." (FE 22, VC 20, JC 19) ". . . some wretched scribbler that writes these things for a drink." (late Maunsel, p. 20. The priest's condemnation of the author of The Apache Chief is intensified and related more specifically to the writing in the story.) b) ". . . used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser." (FE 24, VC 22, JC 21) ". . . used slang freely and spoke of Father Butler as Bunsen Burner." (late Maunsel, p. 23. Mahony's nickname for the priest is given more point.) c) ". . . a jerry hat with a high crown." (FE 27, VC 24, JC 24) ". . . a jerry hat with a very high crown." (late Maunsel, p. 26. This is not strictly an improvement, since it is the reading of the manuscript also. The "very" drops out of the text in the Richards page proofs, probably accidentally, and never gets back in.) d) "The man asked me how many I had." (FE 29, VC 25, JC 25) "The man asked me how many had I." (late Maunsel, p. 27.) As in c) just above, this is the MS reading also, apparently transposed by the compositor in setting the Richards page proofs.) "Araby" Date of composition: The eleventh in order of composition, this story was completed in September 1905. Texts available: 1) late stage of the Maunsel printing; 2) Richards page proofs; 3) First Edition. The development of the text: Though the absence of MS evidence makes speculation somewhat conjectural, this story seems to have satisfied Joyce as completely as any, for there are no major variations among the three texts available. One punctuation change apparently introduced by the compositor for the Richards edition should probably be corrected: "It would be a splendid bazaar, she said she would love to go." (FE 36, VC 31, JC 32) "It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go." (late Maunsel, p. 38) Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: None. " Eveline " Date of composition: The second in order of composition, this story was first published in The Irish Homestead on 10 September 1904. Texts available: 1) Published Irish Homestead text; 2) late stage of the Maunsel printing; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. The development of the text: Joyce revised fairly extensively between the Irish Homestead and the Maunsel versions, and continued tinkering with an odd word or two right up to the First Edition. The changes from the Homestead text are mainly of two kinds. In revising the narration of Eveline's reverie he sometimes replaced words or phrases not quite appropriate for her with more suitable material, and he sometimes added material for the sake of its naturalistic or symbolic point. Consider the examples below. The first consists of an entire paragraph from the Homestead version and the late Maunsel version. Home! She looked round the room, passing in review all its familiar objects. How many times she had dusted it, once a week at least. It was the "best" room, but it seemed to secrete dust everywhere. She had known the room for ten years — more — twelve years, and knew everything in it. Now she was going away. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the Australian priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall, just above the broken harmonium. He had been a friend of her father's — a school friend. When he showed the photograph to a friend, her father used to pass it with a casual word, "In Australia now — Melbourne." Home! She looked round the room reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father's. Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word: —He is in Melbourne now.— Irrelevant matter is pruned away. The word "secrete" which is inappropriate to the thought processes of Eveline is removed, and the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque is inserted. When we learn that this saint paralyzed herself with self-inflicted tortures but was cured miraculously when she vowed to dedicate herself to a holy life, we can see that Joyce is not merely adding to the naturalistic description of the home of Eveline but presenting the reader with a symbolic parallel to her own life of emotional paralysis. In other revisions the speech of the edgy Miss Gavan is sharpened a little and we are given more detail on Eveline's past relationship with her father. Compare the following two passages: Even now — at her age, she was over nineteen — she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father's violence. Latterly he had begun to threaten her, saying what he would do if it were not for her dead mother's sake. Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father's violence. She knew it was that that had given her the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her, like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl; but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother's sake. Here we have not only the interesting addition of the palpitations and the father's past brutality but a significant change in the syntax of the last clause. The formal "were it not for her dead mother's sake" gives way to the "only for her dead mother's sake" in which we can catch the living rhythm of the father's speech. Though the account is narrated rather than dramatized and the discourse indirect rather than direct, the narrative takes its color from the idiom of the characters rather than from any narrative personality. Through countless little changes of this kind, Joyce carefully eliminated his own personality from Dubliners , as he developed a system whereby the events and characters presented in the narrative rather than any assumed narrative persona determine the diction and syntax of the narrative prose. This elimination of the narrator as a personality does away with the need for consistent narrative idiom and paves the way for the experiments of Joyce's later fiction. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: None. "After the Race" Date of composition: The third in order of composition, this story was first published in The Irish Homestead on 17 December 1904. Texts available: 1) Published Irish Homestead text; 2) late stage of the Maunsel printing; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. The development of the text: Though this story saw fewer revisions than either of the others which appeared first in The Irish Homestead , Joyce did make quite a few changes in it for the Maunsel printing. The most heavily revised passage occurs midway through the story, in the paragraph describing Segouin's dinner. For comparison, here is the passage, first as it was in the magazine, then as it became in the late stage of the Maunsel text. The five young men dined in a small comfortable room by candlelight. They talked a great deal and with little reserve. The young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps. They talked volubly and with little reserve. Joyce's intention here in electrifying the lighting was probably to add to the impression of meretriciousness which is one of this story's chief characteristics. In a similar revision he altered "That night the city wore the air of a capital" to "That night the city wore the mask of a capital." An air does not imply the deliberate desire to deceive which a mask does. And, finally, he pointed up Jimmy Doyle's desire to be deceived in the closing paragraph, by adding the material which follows the comma: "He knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly." Joyce also made a number of other minor changes, improving a word here and there. Some of these did not find their way into the Richards text and are noted below. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: a) "Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome . . . ." (FE 49, VC 42, JC 44) "Each blue car, therefore, received a double round of welcome . . . ." (late Maunsel, p. 57) b) ". . . in the face of a high wind . . . ." (FE 51, VC 44, JC 46) ". . . in the teeth of a high wind . . . ." (LM 59) "Two Gallants" Date of composition: The thirteenth in order of composition, this story was finished and sent to Grant Richards to be added to the original twelve on 23 February 1906. Texts available: 1) Fragment of setting for Richards, 1906; 2) Late stage of Maunsel page proofs; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. The development of the text: Being a late story, this one probably was not revised so extensively as some of the early ones. We have two non-consecutive pages from the typesetting made for Grant Richards on 17 April 1906 which differ in no significant way from the later text. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: a) "The notes of the air sounded deep and full." (FE 64, VC 54, JC 58) "The notes of the air throbbed deep and full." (LM 76) b) "'Let's have a look at her, Corley,' he said." (FE 65, VC 54, JC 58) "— Let's have a squint at her, Corley — he said." (LM 76) c) "Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance . . . ." (FE 66, VC 55, JC 59) "Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains to some distance . . . ." (LM 77) d) "The girl brought him a plate of grocer's hot peas. . . ." (FE 68, VC 57, JC 61) "The girl brought him a plate of hot grocer's peas . . . ." (LM 80. This change seems less significant than the others, but it is the only one which appears on Joyce's list of late corrections. Possibly the others had been made on the proofs and were among the two hundred which were ignored by the printer.) " The Boarding House " Date of composition: The fifth in order of composition, this story is dated 1 July 1905 on the only surviving manuscript. Joyce mailed a copy to his brother Stanislaus on 12 July. Texts available: 1) 1905 MS; 2) Late stage of Maunsel page proofs; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. The development of the text: This story was extensively rewritten between the 1905 MS, which was signed "Stephen Daedalus" and apparently intended for the Irish Homestead , and the Dublin printing of 1910. Several aspects of the rewriting warrant commentary. In one respect the rewriting parallels that of "Eveline" discussed above. In eight significant substantive changes the intent is obviously to make the language more colloquial, more appropriate to the events being narrated than to the more lofty tone of the narrative persona, "Stephen Daedalus." Thus, "obliged to enlist himself" becomes "had to become"; "attacked his wife" becomes "went for his wife"; "started a boarding house" becomes "set up a boarding house"; "an amateur boxer" becomes "handy with the mits"; "she had been specific in her enquiries and Polly had been decided in her answers" becomes "she had been frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers"; plain "Lyons" becomes "Bantam Lyons"; "the loss of his job" becomes "the loss of his sit" (colloquial for sit uation); "had a bit of money put by" becomes "had a bit of stuff put by." In other revisions, Joyce is busy at the usual phrase-sharpening, and in one case he is at some pains to make his irony less heavy-handed. The last sentence, originally reading "She remembered now what she had been waiting for: this was it" becomes "Then she remembered what she had been waiting for". But the major revision to the early version of this story consists of an insertion some ten lines long. The nature of the insertion throws light on an interesting aspect of Joyce's technique. Joyce is often praised or blamed (depending on the critic's predilections) for the ambivalence or ambiguity of his fiction. When the artist refuses to provide any authoritative commentary, the critics tell us, we are free to believe whatever we want, and to seek for authorial intention is to commit one of the graver critical fallacies. But to this observer it seems that Joyce gives us our heads expecting us to use them. The insertion in question illustrates how we are to proceed. In the original version there was room for some quibbling about the extent to which each of the two principals was seducer or seducee. The added ten lines provide no commentary, but they give us the bit of evidence we need to resolve the problem with considerable certainty. Then late one night as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door, timidly. She wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a gust. It was her bath night. She wore an open combing jacket of printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin. From her hands and wrists too, as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: a) ". . . the loss of his job." (FE 78, VC 65, JC 70) ". . . the loss of his sit." (LM 92) A manuscript reading which should probably be restored: "There must be reparation made in such cases" is the MS reading for a line which all the printed texts have as ". . . in such case" (VC 64, JC 70). The error presumably crept in during the Irish printing and was never picked up. If Joyce had wanted the singular he would probably have used the standard "in such a case", but there is no evidence that he wanted any change from the MS. " A Little Cloud " Date of composition: The fourteenth in order of composition, this story was written in the first part of 1906 and mailed to Grant Richards in July of that year. Texts available: 1) late stage of Maunsel page proofs; 2) Richards page proofs; 3) First Edition. The development of the text: Like "Two Gallants", which was also written after the first dozen stories had been submitted to Richards, this one probably required almost no revision for the Maunsel printing. Joyce expressed great pleasure in it in October 1906 while he was still working on revisions for some others. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: The one change is so slight as hardly to deserve the word improvement, but Joyce made it, probably feeling the word expressed Mrs. Chandler's attitude more accurately. a) ". . . a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it." (FE 100, VC 83, JC 91) ". . . a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for that." (LM 118) " Counterparts " Date of composition: The sixth in order of composition, this story was written almost simultaneously with "The Boarding House," and finished by 12 July 1905. Texts available: 1) the 1905 MS, nearly complete; 2) late stage of the Maunsel page proofs; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. Development of the text: Like "The Boarding House" this story was revised considerably before the Maunsel printing. The most interesting revisions are those for the long pub scene. Here Joyce added considerable color and life just by making more specific the expressions used for drinks. Thus "a drink" becomes "a half one"; "a drink" becomes "tailors of malt, hot"; "drink up" becomes "polish off that"; "said they would have theirs hot" becomes "told Tim to make theirs hot"; "hot specials" becomes "whiskeys hot"; and "one more" becomes "one little smahan more." Here, as in other revisions, the narrative indirect discourse is enriched by the phraseology of the speakers, and the effect is one of dramatization as the narrator adopts more of the speech of his characters. There are many other revisions in individual words and phrases, but the most interesting is a long passage almost entirely rewritten. In the manuscript the episode of the girl in the pub reads as follows: Farrington said he wouldn't mind having the far one and began to smile at her but when Weathers offered to introduce her he said "No," he was only chaffing because he knew he had not money enough. She continued to cast bold glances at him and changed the position of her legs often and when she was going out she brushed against his chair and said "Pardon!" in a Cockney accent. This was one of the passages Grant Richards objected to as likely to cause trouble, and especially he objected to the girl's changing the position of her legs. Joyce leaped to the defense of his text, invoking the "Areopagitica" and insisting that without details such as this, " Dubliners would seem to me like an egg without salt." But when he came to revise his text after losing his argument with Richards he took it upon himself to expunge the offensive legs, discovering that he could do all he wanted to with arms and eyes. The vastly improved (if censored) passage reads as follows in the late Maunsel text: Farrington's eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of peacock blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and, when after a little time she answered his gaze, he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said O , pardon ! in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him but he was disappointed. In the revised version we are not told so bluntly what Farrington is thinking, but we are brought much closer to his point of view. Naturalism has given way to impressionism in the passage. Even the girl's accent seems different when seen from Farrington's perspective rather than the narrator's. Where the narrator and reader heard Cockney, redolent of slums and sordidness, Farrington hears London, as exotic to him as Araby to the little boy of the earlier story. The reader can form his own opinion of that blue and yellow color combination, and he can judge the woman by the way she brushes against Farrington, but he is not told that her glances are "bold." One is tempted to come to the conclusion, however reluctantly, that if Joyce had taken some of Richards' advice instead of battling him on principle at every point, he might have saved himself a lot of grief and not done Dubliners any harm. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: a) "Funds were getting low . . ." (FE 115, VC 95, JC 105) "Funds were running low . . . ." (LM 136) b) ". . . said with stupid familiarity . . . ." (FE 117, VC 96, JC 107) ". . . said with loutish familiarity . . . ." (LM 138) " Clay " Date of composition: The fourth in order of composition, this story seems to have cost Joyce more pains than most. In November of 1904 he began a story, "Christmas Eve," which he abandoned half finished, apparently because the idea for another, "Hallow Eve," had superseded it. (The MS of "Christmas Eve" has been found and the fragment published in The James Joyce Miscellany , Third Series , 1962.) "Hallow Eve" was completed and sent to Stanislaus Joyce for possible publication in The Irish Homestead in January 1905. James Joyce may have done some revision on the story at this point. It was in his mind much and mentioned frequently in his correspondence during the next few months, while the fifth and sixth stories were not written until July. By September the title had been changed to "The Clay." In November of 1906 Joyce was working on the story again, adding the name of the laundry where Maria works. At some later date he must have reconsidered the title again, dropping the article from it. Texts available: 1) Late stage of Maunsel page proofs; 2) Richards page proofs; 3) First Edition. Development of the text: Until some manuscripts are found we will have to be content with the knowledge that Joyce worked on the story carefully, though we do not know the nature or direction of his improvements. The last change he made, as noted below, suggests that he added some of the details which make Maria appropriately witch-like, a cloak being the proper garment for a witch. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: On two occasions, Maria's garment is described as a "raincloak" in the late Maunsel text rather than as a "waterproof" which is the reading of the modern editions. " A Painful Case " Date of composition: The seventh in order of composition, this story was first written in July of 1905, its original title being "A Painful Incident." A draft was sent to Stanislaus for copying in August of that year. A second manuscript exists, dated 15 August 1905. In August of 1906 Joyce wrote that he had three paragraphs, and then five pages, to add to the story, but the August 1905 manuscript was printer's copy for the Maunsel printing, and there are no lengthy revisions which seem to have been inserted in this text, though this text is longer than the earlier manuscript. The most likely possibilities are these. First, the manuscript dated August 1905 may have been actually written in 1906. This is likely, not so much because Joyce might have misdated it accidentally, though this is possible, but because he often placed the date of original composition on a work which he revised much later. "Tilly" in Pomes Penyeach is backdated in this way, and A Portrait carries both the date of the first draft and that of the last. A second possibility is that the revisions to the story were simply never inserted. This seems to me the least likely alternative. Texts available: 1) Heavily revised first MS; 2) second MS with few revisions, dated 15 August 1905; 3) portion of the late stage of the Maunsel printing; 4) Richards page proofs; 5) First Edition. The development of the text: Joyce's revisions have been covered thoroughly by Marvin Magalaner in Time of Apprenticeship (1959), pp. 87-96. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: None. " Ivy Day in the Committee Room " Date of composition: The eighth in order of composition, this story was completed in all its essentials in a draft dated 29 August 1905, but Joyce continued making minor revisions until the First Edition was printed. Texts available: 1) MS dated 29 August 1905; 2) a later MS used as copy-text for the Maunsel printing; 3) an intermediate stage of the Maunsel printing; 4) Richards page proofs; 5) First Edition. The intermediate stage of the Maunsel printing consists of pages rather than galleys, but retaining the period in "Mr." and other indications that it is not the "late stage" of proof which is available for most of the other stories in Dubliners . This is the only sample yet discovered of the state of the text which was postulated as a hypothetical "C 1 " in my study of the text of "The Dead." This is the state of the Maunsel printing from which the Richards edition was set. Such errors as "Parke's" for "Parkes" and "revenge" for "renege" made by the Irish compositor in setting from Joyce's holograph MS are repeated in the Richards page proofs and finally corrected in the First Edition. No doubt if a late stage of the Maunsel text were available we should find the corrected reading there too. This copy of the intermediate state of the Maunsel printing was not itself copy-text for the Richards, for it contains numerous corrections in Joyce's hand which were not made in the Richards page proofs. A virtually uncorrected set of proofs must have been sent to Richards. The development of the text: The future editor of Dubliners will find himself confronted with an embarrassing complexity of riches in the form of authorial revisions to various states of the text of this story. The second MS, printer's copy for the Maunsel type-setting, contains marginal revisions, some of which were included in the Maunsel proofs and some of which were not, possibly because they were made in the MS after it was used by the compositor. The Maunsel proofs contain holograph corrections, some of which appear in the Richards proofs, most of which do not. Some of the overlooked corrections from both of these sources are inserted in the First Edition and some are not. In one case Joyce, who fought so bitterly for every word of his text against Grant Richards, provides a marginal alternate reading for a disputed passage, apparently leaving the decision to an editor or compositor, whoever cared to make it. After the intermediate stage of the Maunsel edition had been set, Joyce went through it, eliminating all the attempts he had made to reproduce the sounds of Irish speech (e.g., "Owl'" gives way to "old"). He apparently decided that it was inartistic to rely on such nineteenth-century devices, and that he would depend on grammar and syntax alone to make his speech Irish. Of course, the Richards compositor did not have the benefit of these corrections, so the same culling out had to be performed between Richards page proofs and the First Edition. Joyce seems to have started early to indulge in the practice of making heavy revisions in proof much to the distress of all his publishers. Here are some of the major changes and problems related to the text of "Ivy Day." a) On his entrance, Father Keon's voice is described in the modern editions as "a discrete, indulgent, velvety voice" (VC 126, JC 141). In the first MS the sentence continued, "which is not often found except with the confessor or the sodomite." In the second MS the clause is crossed out, in the interests of either decency or subtlety. b) In the second MS Joyce inserted the word "lousy" before the expression "hillsiders and fenians". This should probably be added in the modern texts (VC 125 JC 139). He also substituted "Bantam" for "Lyons" (VC 130 JC 146) in the phrase "Of course Lyons spots the drink first thing" — a change which parallels one in "The Boarding House." c) For a passage relating to Edward VII Joyce provided an alternate reading in the second MS: passage: "He's fond of his glass of grog and he's a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he's a good sportsman . . . ." alternate: "He can take a glass of grog like an honest Christian and, I grant you, he may have [ ] a wild lad in his day and he's a good sportsman." (missing word Joyce's oversight) The alternate, it seems, was not needed. This, of course, was one of the passages which Joyce and his publishers disputed about so violently. d) One sentence was added in the margin of the second MS but never printed. It should probably be added to the modern texts. It is a delightful thing in itself and it adds to the characterization of the ubiquitous Bantam Lyons, which seems to have been one of Joyce's general intentions in his revision of these stories. After ". . . a fit man to lead us" insert "Do you think he was a man I'd like the lady who is now Mrs Lyons to know?" The man in question is Joyce's hero, Parnell (VC 132 JC 148). Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: Since we do not have the late stage of this text, there are none, but the MS changes discussed above should be noted. Perhaps we should also note here one error which has crept into the American text although the First Edition was correct. The phrase "schoolboy of hell" (VC 123) should be "shoeboy of hell". This is not too important, but one critic has already based a clever interpretive paragraph on the misreading. Caveat lector . " A Mother " Date of composition: The tenth in order of composition, this story was finished by late September 1905. Texts available: 1) MS used as printer's copy for the Maunsel edition; 2) galley proofs, the first stage of the Maunsel edition; 3) Richards page proofs; 4) First Edition. Development of the text: Joyce made a number of revisions of the mot juste variety between the galleys and the Richards text. This kind of revision is typical of all his corrections to Dubliners and is probably the least significant. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: Without the late stage of the Maunsel text no lost revisions can be found. " Grace " Date of composition: The twelfth in order of composition, this story was called "the last" by Joyce, as it completed his original plan for twelve stories in four groups of three. He began it in October 1905 and finished it sometime before the twelve stories were sent to Grant Richards in December of that year. But during his stay in Rome the following year he did additional research in the Biblioteca Vittorio Emmanuale for the theological parts of the story. Texts available: MS used for Maunsel printing, very clean copy, probably not 1905 version; 2) Richards page proofs; 3) First Edition. The development of the text: Between the MS and the Richards page proofs, and, to a lesser extent, between the proofs and the First Edition Joyce made a number of minor revisions. In two of the larger of these we can see him eliminating the superior prose of the narrator in favor of plainer locutions, more suited to the subject matter: "Nor was she an utter materialist for she also believed (to a certain extent) in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost" becomes "Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost"; and "a confirmed inebriate" becomes "an incurable drunkard." Other revisions are of the mot juste variety. Lost improvements to the Maunsel text: None. No late Maunsel available. " The Dead " See earlier essay, SB XV (1962), 191-205.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Mathew Carey's Proofreaders by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite naturally, the division of function in the American book trade evolved gradually and at times imperceptibly. The first hundred and fifty years witnessed the progression from booksellers to some who were bookseller-publishers, and then to those who were primarily booksellers and those who were primarily publishers. As the economy grew in the 1790's the publisher apparently found that his volume of business no longer permitted him to do all the work himself. It is during this time, for instance, that Mathew Carey began to employ certain proofreaders over extended periods in addition to calling on others for extra help or for particularly specialized jobs. This was especially necessary when the author was not available or when new editions were issued. By examining the bills Carey preserved, it is possible to determine who these proofreaders were, some of the titles they worked on, and the prices they charged. 1 The bills discussed in this paper comprise those submitted to Carey before January 1, 1817, when the firm became Mathew Carey &amp; Son. From 1785, when he began publishing, to the day he took his son into the firm, he had published more than 650 editions, exclusive of his many Bibles and Testaments. It is not possible, of course, to account for the proofreading of every item, but the number of surviving bills is great enough to warrant study. They fall into three general classes: bills from his "regular" proofreaders, bills from proofreaders on special assignments, and bills from printers which include charges for proofreading. In length of service and amount of work, Samuel Lewis heads the list of Carey's proofreaders. Known at various times as "map maker, draftsman, geographer, writing master," 2 he was evidently an accurate, careful, and erudite person of some reputation. According to his death notice, "Mr. Lewis was well known as a Geographer, and the most celebrated Master of the Pen in the United States;" 3 today what little reputation he has rests upon his ability as a mapmaker. Lewis became associated with Carey about 1794 and continued into 1816, if not longer, doing a variety of tasks, sometimes on a free-lance basis, sometimes full-time, and, at certain periods, no work at all. A few abstracts of his early bills show that Carey originally engaged him to work principally on geographical material: 1794 March 18 Extracting and making list of Plates in Animated Nature ... $ 1.00 Correcting Map of North Carolina ... .75 23 Selecting and arranging Plates of Animated Nature ... 2.00 Correcting and examining Map of New York ... 1.75 25 Small Map of Kentucky ... 3.00 Small Map of Pennsylvania ... 3.00 Additions to Map of Tennessee Government ... 1.50 April 3 Small Map of New York ... 3.00 11 Compiling Tables of Exports ... 1.50 17 To selecting Plates of Animated Nature ... 2.25 To copying Tables of Exports ... .75 25 To correcting Tables of Monies of various Places ... 1.50 June 20 To drawing Map of British possessions in North America ... 12.50 To correcting and making additions to Map of Virginia ... 1.50 Dec. 27 To Colouring three dozen St. Domingo ... 4.80 The tabular matter was probably prepared for William Guthrie's A New System of Modern Geography (1794-95) and the plates for Oliver Goldsmith's An History of the Earth, and Animated Nature (1795). In the following year, Lewis did a few more odd jobs. Some are: 1795 Feb. 7 To correcting proof of Map of Virginia ... $ .33 21 To correcting proofs of Geography ... 2.42 To correcting proof of South Carolina ... .25 March 13 To small Map of Maryland ... 3.00 To do. Virginia ... 3.00 To do. Tennessee ... 3.00 To do. Georgia ... 3.00 Thus did he begin to proofread for Carey. Six years later, his bills cover a much wider range. Scattered throughout his bills, one comes across: 1801 Jan. 2 To correcting 200 sets of Bible ... $ 5.25 April 20 To making four hundred pens ... 1.00 May 22 To reading three proofs of an Oration ... .75 27 To reading thirty-five proofs of Conductor Generalis ... 8.75 June 5 To reading one proof of Columbian Spelling Book ... .25 To do. three proofs of quarto Bible ... 2.00 To making additions to, and correcting set of Maps for the "American Pocket Atlas" ... 5.67 To writing proposals for publishing do. ... .25 12 To examining Index for Conductor Generalis ... .25 26 To double reading proofs Q, R, S, T, U, of Bible ... 6.67 To reading two proofs, D, E, of American Atlas ... .50 To 149 lines of additional matter, in Sheet B, of the American Pocket Atlas, at 1 dollar per page of 44 lines ... 3.38 Aug. 14 To reading proof D of Apocrypha ... .67 To reading two proofs, B, C, of Almanack ... .50 To reading two proofs, Z, aA, of Complete Measurer ... .50 To reading proof O of American Atlas ... .25 To 34 lines of new matter in do. ... .75 Time employed in copy Bon mots, &amp;c. for Almanack ... .21 Other bills show that the printer might be charged for the first proofs of the Bible; on October 16, 1801, Lewis billed Joseph Charless $36.40 for reading the first proof of ninety-one sheets although payment for this was made by Carey. Occasionally, one may get a glimpse of the perennial troubles between printer and proofreader. The bill for July 24, 1801, includes this item: To extra time in attending at Mr. Humphreys', at Mr. Charless' and at the store, to collate and examine proofs, and to revise last proofs 2O, 2P, 2Q, of Bible, viz. Sunday morning 2 hours} besides attending at Mr. Charless' at Monday do 1 do.} appointment, at one o'clock, and Tuesday do 3½ do.} until ½ past 4, for a proof to be ready— Wednesday do 3 do.} they saying it would soon be completed 9½, including waiting for Mr. Humphreys. In the bill for February 23, 1816, Lewis pointed out that he did not read three signatures of Travels in the Interior of Brazil , "in consequence of hurry, Mr. Griggs read himself — and in a note on Mm, said he should read the remainder." From 1801 to at least 1816, Lewis served as part-time and full-time assistant to Carey. When he worked full-time, the bills read "To one week's attendance at Books, reading proofs, &amp;c. $15.00." Part-time bills were more specific: Dec. 26, 1801 To Time employed this week, at Books, 36 hours $ 8.00 Jan. 15, 1803 To 25 hours employed at Books ... 4.16 March 26, 1804 To 21 hours correcting Bibles ... 7.00 April 27, 1804 To 18 hours correcting and enlarging Letterpress Copy of Traveller's Directory ... 6.00 June 15, 1804 To time correcting Bibles, 30 hours ... 10.00 To reading H, O, S2, AA, whole sheets Bible ... 2.00 June 18, 1804 To 5 hours employed making list of American Books ... 1.67 June 15, 1805 To time employed at Books, &amp;c. hours viz. May 16 3½ headings to Ledger 18 3½} } Bibles 23 2½} June 1 4½ Ledger 12 3} } list of Books 15 9} 26 hours ... $ 8.67 Feb. 10, 12, 1807 To 4 hours, making entries in Day Book and Journal ... 1.00 The phrase "time employed at Books" is, therefore, so ambiguous that the price per hour varied greatly. Proofreading, however, was usually noted separately in bills for part-time work: Jan. 15, 1803 To 25 hours employed at Books ... $ 4.16 reading proofs Q, R, S of Parent's Friend ... .75 do. do. D, E of Vade Mecum ... .50 Or, to cite another example: Aug. 10, 1805 To 13 hours employed at Books ... $ 3.25 reading G, H, Clerk's Assistant ... .50 do. I American Preceptor ... .25 do. B, C, D, E, and 4F, Doway Bible ... 3.33 As publisher, Carey sometimes employed more than one printer for a book. The following bill, possessing bibliographical as well as historical interest, exemplifies the publisher's proofreader at work: Aug. 27, 1812 To reading 14 Sig. printed by Dickinson of Weems's Life of Washington ... $ 3.50 Reading 2 do. -- printed by Aitken (O. P.) ... .50 Throughout the period he read for Carey, Lewis maintained a rather stable price scale. Most of the proofreading jobs were billed at twenty-five cents per sheet; the Bible cost sixty-seven cents with the price doubled for a "double reading." As would be expected in so many documents, exceptions to these prices appear from time to time. Among them, two may be noted: in 1805, Lewis charged fifty cents a sheet for a Testament "as per agreement" and in 1816 he charged thirty-one and a quarter cents each for the proofs of Travels in the Interior of Brazil . Carey's other principal proofreader was Daniel Humphreys, known today for the books and newspapers he printed and published. But his contemporary reputation included an additional occupation: in 1812, William McCulloch, writing to Isaiah Thomas, called him "the correct proof reader." 4 His earliest bills in the Mathew Carey Papers bear the date of 1801 and all of them refer to reading or revising Bible proof. In that one year, he corrected more than 275 sheets at a charge of five shillings each for reading and one shilling ten and a half pence for revision. 5 Two years later, he continued on Bible proof at the same rate until September when what must have been a special job came along: 1803 £ s d Sept. 26 To reading 23 sheets Old Testament A to Z, &amp;c.mmat; 10 s ... 11 10 ... To do. 19 do. Apocrypha 2X to 3Q, &amp;c.mmat; 5 s ... 4 15 ... Nov. 3 To reading 43 sheets in Old Testament, &amp;c.mmat; 10 s ... 21 10 ... To. do. 19 do. in Apocrypha, &amp;c.mmat; 5 s ... 4 15 ... To do. 27 do. in New Testament ... 6 15 ... To do. 4 do. in Index ... 1 ... ... To second reading one half of above ... 7 10 ... More than likely this is the proof of Carey's "standing" Bible of 1804, though the reason for the double charge on the Old Testament is not clear. It may have been for a double reading. In 1803, Humphreys also read proof for the edition of Pennsylvania laws, printed for Carey by John Bioren, and the cost of this, $99.26, appears on Bioren's bill to Carey. During the following eight years, Carey gave Humphreys a variety of texts, some of which were: 1806 Aug. 15 To reading 9 proofs Vade Mecum ... $ 2.70 To do. 140 do. Walker's Dictionary ... 70.00 Sept. 20 To do. 26 do. Ferg. Mechanics, vol. 1 ... 6.50 To do. 38 do. do. vol. 2 ... 9.50 1807 Jan. 15 To reading 16 proofs Beattie's Elements ... 4.80 To do. 13 do. Black's Lectures, vol. 1 ... 3.25 To do. 55 do. vol. 2 ... 13.75 To. do. 59 do. vol. 3 ... 14.75 Feb. 15 To making Index for do. ... 5.00 Dec. 15 To reading 14 proofs Goldsmith's History ... 4.20 To do. 69 do. Roman Antiquities ... 20.70 1808 Sept. 20 To reading 17 proofs Concordance ... 12.75 To do. 7 do. Psalms ... 3.50 To do. 2 do. Astronomy ... .50 To do. 21 do. Tacitus ... 10.50 To marking References for do. ... 1.00 1809 May 1 To reading 7 proofs Gulliver's Travels, &amp;c.mmat; 52 cts. ... 3.64 To do. 19 do. Washington's Life, &amp;c.mmat; 28 cts. ... 5.32 To do. 4 do. Ladies Library, &amp;c.mmat; 63 cts. ... 2.52 July 15 To 4 proofs Charlotte Temple, &amp;c.mmat; 73 cts. ... 2.92 Dec. 30 To 10 do. Letter Writer, &amp;c.mmat; 33 cts. ... 3.30 About 1808, the charges became more precise and extended over a wider range. In 1811, Humphreys' lowest price seems to have been twenty-five cents a sheet for Breslaw's Last Legacy ; his highest ninety cents for Moore's Fables for the Ladies ; various other proofs were read at odd prices in between. Of Carey's other proofreaders, only one, James Hardie, has been discussed in recent literature. 6 Hardie's career, pathetic though it be, did produce some useful publications and his name has not been forgotten. But one searches in vain for information about four of Carey's proofreaders. Who was the "Fran s . Wright" who billed Carey in 1792 and 1793? The charges, one shilling three pence per signature, covered corrections for such works as Blair's Lectures on Rhetorick and Belles Lettres , Crèvecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer , and O'Keeffe's Wild Oats . A Francis Wright appears in the Philadelphia directories for 1794, 1795, and 1796, listed in 1795 as a carter. It might be he. It could not, however, be the Frances Wright whose work Carey later published for she was not born until 1795. Nor does any information appear to be available about John Edington who, in May and June, 1795, received one pound four shillings for correcting eight proof sheets of Goldsmith's History of the Earth . John Lithgow's activities, at least, show some progress. According to the Philadelphia directories, he was a hosier in 1795 and 1796, a shopkeeper in 1800, and an "accomptant" from 1802 to 1804. His bill to Carey, dated 1800, is printed verbatim: about two months ago I told you that you owed me for one week and one day which was chiefly for the first Volume history of Greece, some proofs reading, and arranging Cuts for small Books. all that I had done for you for about a month before ... 8.00 Since I have read 20 proofs ¼ per ... 5.00 half a Day at the library ... .50 _____ 13.50 Another obscure person, John M. Robinson, billed Carey on September 23, 1809, for "reading proof ½ of 5 days, 128 pages quarto Bible $4.16." Whether these individuals possessed the background and skill required cannot now be determined, but other proofreaders employed by Carey were certainly well educated. Some were teachers, others ministers. Those perennially low-paid scholars most likely found proofreading rather agreeable as part-time work and Carey, in turn, could call on their talents whenever needed. Jesse Waterman was one such person, listed in the Philadelphia directories as schoolmaster and "teacher of the French and English languages" from 1791 to 1829. 7 His bill, submitted in 1796, shows that he was given appropriate work: £ s d For correcting 10 Sheets of Perrins french Grammar &amp;c.mmat; 2/6 1 5 ... 18 Goldsmiths animated nature 2/6 ... 2 5 ... 32 do. Guthries Geography 2/6 ... 4 ... ... 8 do. of Edwards affections &amp;c.mmat; 2/6 ... 1 ... ... 15 do. Jefferson's Notes &amp;c.mmat; 2/6 ... 1 17 6 Eleven years later, when Carey planned to issue a revised edition of Fenelon's Adventures of Telemachus in French and English, he turned to his son's tutor, Lewis C. Vallon, who had been French Teacher at the University of Pennsylvania in 1795. 8 Vallon's bills consequently show his combined efforts: Feb. 7, 1807: To 4 months French Tuition of his Son, at $12 a quarter, due the 5 th inst. ... $16.00 To fire wood, quills and ink for said time ... 1.33 To altering the proofs of the 1 st Vol. of Telemachus ... 9.00 1807: To 1 quarter French Schooling of his Son, due May the 5 th ... 12.00 To fire wood quills &amp; ink ... 1.00 To correcting 8 books, adventures of Telemachus ... 6.00 June 8, 1807: To 1 month French tuition of his Son, due the 5 th inst. ... 4.12½ To correcting the last 4 books of the adventures of Telemachus 3.00 Vallon must have done a satisfactory job; in December of the following year, he corrected some proofs of Lhomond's Élémens de la Grammaire Françoise , charging four dollars. Thus Waterman and Vallon, both proficient in languages, could be employed on specialized jobs. Another teacher, Edward Farris, did occasional reading in 1802. 9 Four of his bills fail to specify the texts he corrected at five shillings a sheet, but a fifth refers to twenty-three sheets of Bible and Testament at the same rate. In the sixth bill, the text is again unspecified and the charge is four dollars for four sheets. The frequent references to Bible proofs indicate the great care exercised in the publication of Carey's editions. His autobiography tells about the 1801 quarto: I had eighteen various editions to collate in the reading of the proof sheets, — four London, three Cambridge, three Oxford, six Edinburgh, and two American, — those of Isaac Collins and Isaiah Thomas, — and found a most extraordinary number of discrepancies, some of which are incredible. 10 Along with Lewis and Humphreys, the Rev. William Marshall, minister of the Scots' Presbyterian Church, also read proof of an 1801 Bible. 11 Because two Bibles were issued in that year, a quarto as well as a duodecimo, it is not possible to assign the bills to the editions. Marshall corrected more than a hundred sheets at the same price per sheet paid Humphreys — five shillings; Lewis received sixty-seven cents. As the volume of the publishing business increased after the turn of the century, proofreading gradually became an established occupation. William Christie, for example, is listed in some of the Philadelphia directories of the second decade as "translator and corrector of the press." 12 During the first decade, he preached Unitarianism, published some sermons, and also, at times, worked on proof for Carey in 1807, 1808, and 1809. One of his bills, June 10, 1807, refers to correcting nine sheets of Telemachus in French and English at fifty cents per sheet. Vallon, evidently, was not the only competent person to read the text even though his name is on the title page as reviser and corrector of the edition. This instance of distributing the sheets of one work among readers is, of course, not unique. In August, 1804, both Lewis and Humphreys read sheets of the Laws of the United States ; two years later, both submitted bills for correcting sheets of Ferguson's book on mechanics. Unfortunately, Humphreys did not specify the signatures he read, precluding verification of whether both read the same or different sheets. One may assume that, with few exceptions such as the Bible, sheets were given to the reader who could return them soonest. Then, as now, the publisher was anxious to see the book completed. In his bills, Christie was usually careful enough to note the imposition as well as the specific pages, as in these: [c. 1807] For reading, and correcting for the press, as follows, viz. The Letters of Junius, from p. 49 to the end inclusive, with the Notes, Index and Contents p. 273, 12 mo is 11⅓ sheets at 50 cents per sheet ... $ 5.66 Dodsley's select Fables &amp;c. 240 p. 12 mo. is 10 sheets, at 50 cents per sheet ... 5.00 Abridgment of Christian Doctrine for the Use of the Catholic Church &amp;c. 48 p. 24 to. is 1 sheet ... .50 For correcting for the press Adam's Roman Antiquities, a work consisting of 632 pages 8vo. including preface contents &amp;c. is 39½ sheets at 75 cents per sheet ... 29.62½ Carey also gave Christie some foreign language jobs. Christie corrected some of the sheets of Lhomond's French grammar (as did Vallon) for one dollar per sheet and he corrected twenty-one sheets of Horace in Latin and English at the same price. But when, in 1809, he billed Carey for sheets of the School Bible, the price was one dollar and twenty-five cents. A few bills in the Carey Papers show that an editor of a work sometimes included proofreading as part of the job. In 1813, Thomas Clark edited Caesar for a group of publishers. Carey took one-fourth of the edition and Clark's bill of April 12 is for one-fourth of $152.00, "being the amount of editing &amp; proofreading of Caesar." For a cooperative edition of Horace, Clark's bill of Dec. 8, 1813, reads: "For revising; &amp; for the collecation of the Delphini edition of Horace, with the original one of Paris, &amp; with other [ sic ] of approved accuracy; — —— Like wise for Proof reading of the same —— a 3/20th part of the whole amount $200." In another joint publishing venture, the 1810 edition of Cornelius Nepos, the bill came from the printer. Nevertheless, Lydia R. Bailey added a proofreading charge of $3.88 to her bill for printing. Finally, it must be noted that a proofreading charge also appears on a few printers' bills for books which Carey alone published. This may be seen in James Carey's bill of August, 1794, where proofreading six sheets of Bunyan's Holy War was billed at $4.33 and proofreading 2½ sheets of Bunyan's Divine Emblems cost $1.66. It can also be seen in Abel Dickinson's bill of January, 1809, where he included Christie's fee for reading part of the seventh edition of Mary Findley . But such occurrences are so rare that one wonders whether there were some special circumstances which are not noted on the bills. As large as the Carey archive is, it still leaves many questions unanswered. The rather unsystematic bookkeeping of the period plus the lack of detail in many items cause puzzlement if not confusion. Yet in this group of bills, the beginnings of work specialization in American publishing can be observed. In the 1790's and early 1800's, no American firm was large enough to support a full-time publishing staff. But bigness was approaching, and proofreading became, during this period, a part-time occupation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"Bound in Boston by Henry B. Legg" by Hannah D. French *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the restoration of the town Bible of Salisbury, Connecticut, and its subsequent exhibition, a unique early American binding came to light. It was printed in Philadelphia, 1796-98, bound in Boston, and presented to his native town by one of the subscribers; and the Selectmen of Salisbury on May 19, 1800, gratefully acknowledged it with a note of thanks to Mr. Caleb Bingham of Boston "for his valuable Present of an Elegant Folio Bible" which they received as "a token of his attachment to, and affection for his native Town." 1 The Bible is of interest for a variety of reasons. Its local association is important to the citizens of Salisbury, for it was presented by that most estimable native son, Caleb Bingham, educator, writing master, and at the time of presentation, a prominent bookseller in Boston. The donor's inscription is irresistible to students of American handwriting, its flourishes further adorned with a calligraphic eagle. Much can be said for the Bible itself, which came from the "Hot-Press" of John Thompson of Philadelphia. Indeed the justifiably proud printer and publisher advertised it with patriotic fanfare in the Philadelphia newspapers during the years it was appearing in forty numbers published bi-weekly. John Thompson and Abraham Small announced it as, "the most beautiful production of its nature hitherto seen." 2 Their advertisement went on to describe the paper as the best, the types as beautiful, the apparatus for hot-pressing as procured from different parts of the Union, all of it American, and the value as "the cheapest hot-pressed Bible ever printed in any country." This Bible was naturally esteemed in its own city, but it was honored, also, outside its place of origin. The list of subscribers includes sixty-five from Boston, among them such important booksellers as Ebenezer Larkin, Isaiah Thomas, and David West, in addition to Caleb Bingham. The New York list was much longer and of course Philadelphia's was longest of all. Two Philadelphia bookbinders, whose names were not in the list of subscribers, are known to have bound copies now in existence, Robert Aitken and John Cameron. Aitken, printer, engraver, and bookbinder of renown, bound several copies, three in "extra Gilt leaves, broad border Morocco," two volumes £9; and one, two volumes "Gilt," £4.10. 3 One of the copies in morocco was recently exhibited in Philadelphia. 4 Though the Aitken copy is not signed, the Bible formerly belonging to Isaac Gouveneur, subscriber from New York, bears the label of John Cameron, "South-west corner of Dock and Walnut Streets, Philadelphia." 5 Less elaborate than Aitken's binding in morocco and much more decorative than the simple calfskin binding with gilt spine by Cameron, the Bible bound by Henry B. Legge is in one thick folio instead of the two volumes of the other two binders, and is signed in gold italic capitals at the foot of the spine, "Bound in Boston by Henry B. Legg." Thick as it was, the volume would not accommodate the final e of the binder's last name. This handsomely decorated and solidly constructed binding is signed and placed; it is perhaps the only surviving signed work of a binder hitherto known just by name. The name Henry B. Legge appears in the Boston directories for 1798 through 1803 and in various newspaper advertisements. 6 This binder worked in partnership with one Mirick in June of 1799, but the partnership dissolved in September of that year. His advertisement of June 15 read: Henry Bilson Legge is desirous of informing Gentlemen, Merchants and Traders, in general, and his own countrymen in particular, that he has been regularly bred to the Manufactories above mentioned, in England — that he has had much experience in London , and different parts of America , and has no doubt of giving that complete satisfaction in Boston , which has attended his endeavours in those places. 7 He described his work with the usual phrases, "BOOK-BINDING, Extra and elegant or strong and plain." He made much of the strength of his bindings, promising double leather joints when wanted, and directed prospective customers to Mr. E. Larkin's shop at No. 47 Cornhill to see a sample of one of the many sets of "the Encyclopaedia " which he and Mirick had bound. This advertisement appears to have brought him customers, for he moved his shop in December, 1799, to the first store in Quaker Lane and in his removal notice returned "grateful thanks to his friends and customers for their many and increasing favors." 8 At the same time he advertised for "Two well-behaved ingenious LADS," for his business. The Boston directory for 1800 listed his business at Congress Street and his house at Cornhill, the same street as Caleb Bingham's bookshop. In his last appearance in the directory, that of 1803, his address is 10 State Street and his house at Pond Street. In 1804 his death notice appeared in at least two Boston newspapers. The fuller notice read: Yesterday, Mr. Henry B. Legge, bookbinder, Aet. 41. He was an honest man. His funeral will be Tomorrow afternoon, from his dwelling-house, No. 84, Newbury-street, where his relations and friends are respectfully invited to attend. The Brethren of his Fraternity, of which he was a member, are also respectfully invited. 9 The other notice dismissed him with one sentence, "He was an honest man." 10 Five days later, on November 15, James F. Fletcher, "Bookbinder and working Stationer", informed the public that he had taken over the shop of the late Mr. Henry B. Legge "at No. 10 State-street, and corner of Congress-street" and would carry on the business, with an added "N.B. Two Gentlemen can be accommodated with Boarding. Inquire of Mrs. Legge, No. 84, Newbury-street." 11 Mr. Fletcher's notice suggests that the Congress Street and State Street addresses of the directories for 1800 and 1803 were the same and Legge must have worked at that corner for four of the six years he is known to have been in Boston. There are certain mysteries about Henry B. Legge and his career. Though he gives us his word that he has worked in London and different parts of America, neither Ellic Howe, the Browns, nor George McKay list his name. 12 Nor has it been found in directories or newspapers in other towns. Coincidentally, the name itself is similar to that of the fourth son of the Earl of Dartmouth, Henry Bilson-Legge, who died in England the year after Henry B. Legge, bookbinder, was born. The newspaper advertisements reveal only what we should have been able to guess from this signed binding of the Salisbury town Bible, that the binder was trained in England and was capable of especially fine and durable work. Four features of this binding are unusual in American work: the material, the technique, the decoration, and the signature. The use of diced Russia is unusual as early as the turn of the century though a version of it was popular about 1820. The use of the double leather joint, even for so heavy a book, was all but unknown. The symbolic ornamentation of the covers, combining the dove and the two serpents is far more imaginative than was common. Finally, the signing of the binding in gold at the foot of the spine appears in only one other American binding, that of the first American edition of Shakespeare, signed by Lightbody. 13 What makes the Boston binding unique is the inclusion of the place as well as the binder's name in the signature. Although his name is not found in the city directories, John Lightbody worked for the Library Company of Philadelphia in June of 1798. Nothing more is known about him, to date, except the date of his death and that of his son in October of that same year — presumably of yellow fever. 14 Lightbody, good Scottish name, may have been even more of a wanderer than Legge. Each man is known by one signed binding, and each man has used symbolism in the decoration of his work. Lightbody adorned his covers with a stencilled eagle; Legge used the dove and serpents of the Bible. If their work emerges from the shadows at some later date they may be found to have more connection. One other American binder used a gold-tooled signature somewhat later but he placed it inside the cover rather than on the spine. 15 John Roulstone, Boston binder also, did not date his signed bindings but they appear to have been done around 1820. A donation of a syllabus of Dr. Francis Nicholls's lectures from John Nicholls of London, presented to Harvard by Ward Nicholas Boylston, is lettered inside the front cover, "Bound by J. Roulstone, Boston." 16 Two identical copies of the folio Book of Common Prayer , printed in New York by Hugh Gaine in 1795, probably bound about twenty-five years later, are similarly signed, "Roulstone, J. Binder, Boston," this time inside the back covers. The prayer book is far too thin a folio to allow for a signature on the spine. John Roulstone was a native Bostonian who died in 1826, aged forty-eight, after a bookbinding career of twenty-three years. He worked on Congress Street in 1803, and from 1810 to 1823 at 10 State Street. Roulstone and Legge appear to have worked in the same building if not the same shop. We do not know to whom Roulstone was apprenticed and where he learned his craft, but he became an excellent binder. His superior workmanship and method of signing suggest that he may have learned from Henry Bilson Legge, binder of Caleb Bingham's presentation copy of "the most beautiful production of its nature hitherto seen."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">James Kirke Paulding's Contributions to American Magazines by Ralph M. Aderman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A mong the once popular American writers of the early nineteenth century is James Kirke Paulding, whose name is now known only to the devoted bibliophile or the literary historian probing in the remains of long-forgotten essays, novels, or short stories. In his prime, however, Paulding ranked in popularity with Irving and Cooper as a story-teller who combined narrative talent with enthusiastic nationalism. Once he had discovered his writing facility and received acclaim for his part in Salmagundi , First Series (1807-1808), Paulding wrote unremittingly, almost compulsively, for nearly half a century. His versatility is noteworthy, for he wrote short stories, novels, plays, book reviews, travel sketches, political commentaries, burlesques, parodies, and letters. His poetry includes The Backwoodsman , a book-length tale of the frontier, and dozens of brief effusions on a wide variety of topics. 1 In the frenzy of his writing Paulding seldom revised his outpourings, with the result that while they were suitable for the moment their frequent lack of grace and polish causes them, rightfully, to be neglected today. Beneath their roughness, however, lie the observations of an alert, cultured individual interested in the problems and ideas of his age. Consequently, his writings are a valuable source for the social and cultural historians of the first half of the nineteenth century. Because some of his reviews and critical commentaries were doubtless dashed off during the heat of his reaction to a book or to a political or social event, they were promptly forgotten when his interest turned elsewhere. 2 Paulding wrote almost exclusively for the New York and Philadelphia magazines, for in these cities he had literary, social, and business connections. His early associations with the Port Folio and the Analectic Magazine in Philadelphia opened the way for later contacts there with the American Quarterly Review , Graham's Magazine , and Godey's Lady's Book . After he returned to New York from Washington in 1824 Paulding contributed most extensively to the New-York Mirror , edited by his admirer and long-time champion, George Pope Morris. The Mirror printed Paulding's stories and sketches, reviewed his books favorably, published copious extracts from them, and passed along any literary gossip involving him, the eight-page weekly thus serving admirably as Paulding's publicity medium in the early 1830's. Through his constant exposure in the magazines Paulding was regarded as one of the country's leading literati, a fact which greatly aided the sale of his books. 3 Although Paulding acknowledged some of his offspring in periodicals with his signature, many of them have sunk into the oblivion of anonymity. By following hints gleaned from his letters, from references made by his contemporaries, from surviving cost books of magazine publishers, and from a study of his style, scholars have uncovered many of Paulding's anonymous contributions. Despite these efforts, many pieces still lie unnoticed, awaiting further clues before they can be positively identified. Probably Paulding wrote some of his earliest pieces for Select Reviews and Spirit of Foreign Magazines , a predecessor of the Analectic Magazine which flourished between 1809 and 1812, but they cannot be singled out with any degree of certainty. 4 Except for short periods when his energies were diverted into public affairs or concentrated novel-writing, Paulding continued to compose articles and sketches for the outstanding magazines to within a few years of his death in 1860. In this collection of Paulding's magazine writings I have included only those which he signed or for which we have reasonably reliable evidence of his authorship. Such evidence as the Carey and Hart account books for the American Quarterly Review , a collection of Paulding's pieces from the Analectic Magazine signed by him and bound in book form (now in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library), and numerous allusions in his correspondence has noticeably increased the number of items which we can attribute to him. I have encountered other unsigned selections which seem to bear his hallmark, but I have not included them in the following list. I have excluded, in addition, all of his first-hand newspaper contributions 5 and his stories and poems published in the gift books and literary souvenirs of the 1820's and 1830's.

      <field name="heading_text">Unsigned and Initialed Contributions to The Freeman by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just before The Freeman ceased publication on 5 March 1924, the Nation described it as the "best written and most brilliantly edited of the weeklies of protest," "a literary production to compel admiration, whether one agreed with its views or not." 1 The New Republic , believing that The Freeman's "wit and vigor and lucidity . . . ought not to perish in America," said, "It carried on through four perplexing years, satisfying the intellectual needs and clarifying the political views of thousands of readers. . . . On its constant readers — and few periodicals ever had more loyal ones — the Freeman exerted an influence that will not die. This is success. It is through such successes that a nation's cultural wealth is slowly accumulated." 2 The Century felt that The Freeman "commented upon the news of the world with remarkable insight and unflagging wit" and considered it worthy of comparison with the Tatler and Spectator . 3 Enthusiastic comments continued to appear in discussions of the period, 4 and one of its editors, Albert Jay Nock, later declared that it was "quite generally acknowledged to be the best paper published in our language" 5 — a judgment concurred in by Van Wyck Brooks, who called it "a paper that was generally known as the best written in the country." 6 There is no question that The Freeman , published in New York between 17 March 1920 and 5 March 1924 by that enterprising young publisher B. W. Huebsch, 7 was one of the important and influential journals of this century. Its 4,992 large double-column pages maintain a consistently high standard and must surely constitute one of the most massive monuments of journalistic excellence ever produced in so short a period. The failure to compromise, characteristic of The Freeman , is illustrated by the manner of its demise. After four years (with Helen Swift Neilson as the financial backer), the paper was discontinued both because of the "large annual deficit" and because of the failure to secure a "body of readers sufficiently large to warrant further publication." An editorial announcement explained that "circulation 'experts' who were consulted offered feasible suggestions, but every suggestion was based on a different Freeman than the one the editors were making. If we had adopted them the circulation might have gone up a few tens of thousands, but the Freeman would have lost its soul — and the adherence of those who mourn over it to-day." 8 The twenty-four weekly pages continued in their usual fashion for a month after the first announcement of discontinuance (on 6 February 1924), in order to round out Volume VIII, and then publication ceased, with eight full volumes to look back on and no gradual diminishing of strength at the end. The list of frequent contributors included Van Wyck Brooks, Charles A. Beard, Constance Rourke, Kenneth Burke, Lewis Mumford, Padraic Colum, Ernest A. Boyd, Llewelyn Powys, and many other well-known names, and it was equally penetrating on literary and political matters (with practically every point of view represented). As the period of the twenties becomes more intensively studied, it is inevitable that The Freeman will receive increasing attention. Although the story of its inception and brief career has been told by one of its editors, Francis Neilson, 9 and by Susan Jane Turner, 10 one difficulty in studying it has been the presence in it of a great amount of both unsigned and initialed material, the authorship of which could not be easily established. The only clue to the authorship that has been generally available is The Freeman Book (New York: B. W. Huebsch, 1924), an anthology of selections from The Freeman ; although it contains samples of all the kinds of articles in the journal and indicates the authors, it is of course in no sense a systematic guide to the authorship of the unsigned pieces since it gives only a small selection from the work of forty writers. However, the authorship of all unsigned work was marked in several copies of each issue, and some of these marked files are available for examination. Mr. B. W. Huebsch has one such set in his possession, and there is a partially marked set in the library of Francis Neilson at Harbor Acres in Port Washington, Long Island. The set which belonged to Helen Swift Neilson, founder of The Freeman , and which was marked by Emilie McMillan, a member of the staff, is now in the Newberry Library, the gift of Mrs. Neilson. Because of the rarity of these marked copies and the importance of the information they contain, it seems highly desirable that a complete description of the special information in them be made readily accessible. 11 It may be helpful, first of all, to have in mind the format of The Freeman . Each issue consisted of 24 pages and generally followed this pattern: the first three pages were made up of separate unsigned paragraphs or very short articles under the heading "Current Comment"; pages 4 through 8 consisted of the longer unsigned editorials, collectively called "Topics of the Day"; the next six pages (pp. 9-14) usually contained the signed articles; there followed a short section, "Miscellany," made up of paragraphs similar to those in "Current Comment," sometimes by several hands and sometimes by one (signed "Journeyman"); the sixteenth page might carry a review of a current musical or dramatic performance or a literary essay (referred to, along with the other signed pieces, as "Middle Articles" in The Freeman Book ); then came two pages of letters to the editors, often from distinguished persons or from other members of the staff writing under pseudonyms; pages 18 to 23, roughly, consistuted the book review section, consisting of a series of individual reviews (many signed with initials) followed by a column of literary comment; and page 24 was an advertisement (for The Freeman itself or for other Huebsch publications). The lists which follow record the information about authorship that has been written into the Newberry and Huebsch copies. The first indicates, by initials, the authors of all unsigned work; the second identifies these initials and many other initials (and pseudonyms) which actually appeared as signatures in The Freeman . The third is an index to the first two, supplementing the index to the signed material which The Freeman published with each volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Authorship of Unsigned Material In this chronological list, each author of unsigned work has been given a set of initials. The information presented here is based on the Newberry and Huebsch copies, and, in the few instances where there is disagreement between them in attribution of authorship (or between them and The Freeman Book ), the discrepancy is recorded in a footnote. At times, too, the attribution is made on the basis of only one copy if the author's initials have not been marked at that point in the other copy — the Newberry set sometimes skips items that are marked in the Huebsch, and there are no markings whatsoever in Volume IV at Newberry. Only very rarely has it been necessary to infer the authorship of a piece (one not marked in either copy) and in these cases the initials are in brackets below. 12 The kind of evidence used for such inferences can be illustrated by the case of the book review columns, the principal instance where inferences are necessary, since these columns are, more often than not, unmarked in both copies. Van Wyck Brooks was the literary editor of The Freeman , and the Newberry copy does contain his initials on all the book columns in the first three volumes (except the few that are signed in print by someone else). In Volumes IV and V these columns are not marked in either set, but it has seemed sensible to attribute them to Brooks up to the issue of 24 May 1922, 13 since in that issue (V, 262) occurs the following statement: "During the temporary absence of Mr. Van Wyck Brooks, the Literary Department of the Freeman will be conducted by Mr. Albert Jay Nock." Beginning with that issue it is safe to regard Nock as author even when his initials are not written in (as they occasionally are); this decision is supported by references to Brooks' absence (as V, 358: "When the regular editor of this department went away and left me to act as caretaker for him . . .") and by the presence in The Freeman Book (pp. 377-382) of a column from this period assigned to Nock (V, 430-431). Then in the issue of 10 January 1923 comes an announcement (VI, 430) that Brooks will take over again in the following issue after an absence of seven months. Therefore, beginning with 17 January 1923, and on through Volumes VI and VII, Brooks may again be considered the author of "The Reviewer's Notebook." 14 No book column of this kind appears in Volume VIII except in the last five issues. There seems to be no question, then, about the authorship of the book columns (and perhaps that is why there are so few markings for them), but the initials appear in brackets below unless the attribution is based specifically on the Newberry or Huebsch copies or The Freeman Book . Reference below is, first, by volume number, issue number, and date, and then, after the dash, by page. Lower-case letters correspond to individual paragraphs 15 beginning on the page noted; when a page number has no letters associated with it, all unsigned paragraphs which start on that page are by the author indicated. Such a system is necessary in connection with the "Current Comment" and "Miscellany" sections of each issue, where individual paragraphs are usually by different authors ("Miscellany" is thus included here even though it actually carries a signature, "Journeyman"). But for the longer pieces, a single page number refers to the only article which both begins and ends on that page, and an inclusive number to the only article that is continued across the pages indicated.

      <field name="fulltext">II. Identification of Initials and Pseudonyms The following list, containing 290 initials and 31 pseudonyms, serves two purposes: first, it provides a key for identifying the initials used in the preceding section; second, it lists (by volume and page) all occurrences of initials actually printed in The Freeman as signatures. In other words, if an initial below has only a name following it (and no page references), it has been used only in Part I of this study, as a convenience, and does not appear in print in The Freeman ; but if page references are given below, then the initial (often not appearing in Part I at all) can be found printed as a signature on those pages. Many of these printed initials have not been identified (frequently they are attached to letters to the editor), but all identifications made in the Newberry or Huebsch copies are recorded here. In any case, the list serves as an index to all initials in The Freeman (these are indexed in only three of the eight published volume-indexes — V, VI, VIII). Pseudonyms offer a somewhat different case. Since pseudonyms are not always recognizable as such, a complete listing is impossible unless every pen name had been identified in the Newberry or Huebsch copies. Signatures like "Indicus," "Cives," "Pioneer," or "Theologus," obvious pen names, are not marked in these copies, and it is therefore likely that other unknown pseudonyms as well occur in the eight volumes. Because of the impossibility of a complete list and because these names are covered in the regular index, it has seemed most sensible to list here only those names identified as pen names in one of the marked copies. In the case of initials as well as of pseudonyms, figures in brackets below refer to an unmarked occurrence of the initial or pseudonym in question, the identification of which can be inferred from other instances where a marking does appear.

      <field name="fulltext">III. Index The first two sections of this study will be most helpful to the person who has found an article or an initial in The Freeman that he wants identified; this third section goes at the matter from the other direction and is designed for readers who wish to know whether or not a particular author ever published anything in The Freeman besides the items given in the regular indexes of signed articles. 30 The following list of 184 authors is an index to the preceding two sections. The numbers are issue numbers (since these run consecutively throughout the life of the journal) and indicate that the author in question contributed to those issues some unsigned work (which can then be located in Part I). The letters (and names in quotation marks) are initials (and pseudonyms); additional page references can be found by looking up these letters in Part II. Anderson, Maxwell: 28; MA.

Nock's account of The Freeman appears on pp. 167-174. He there describes it as "a radical publication": "That is to say, we struck straight through to the root of whatever subject we discussed. We had no ink to waste on superficialities. We were not taken in by buncombe or clap-trap, and while we were urbane about it, we managed to let our readers know our opinion of those who hawked these commodities" (p. 171). 6 Days of the Phoenix (1957), p. 57. For Brooks' description of The Freeman , see Chapter IV, pp. 52-65. He defines the tone of the paper as "that of the rigorous amateur, the unspecialized non-professional man of letters"; "all our reviews," he says, "seemed to be written for the interest and pleasure of writing them, not for the mere satisfaction of getting them done" (p. 62). 7 I am currently preparing a history and bibliography of the Huebsch imprint. 8 Freeman , VIII (20 February 1924), 576. See also Neilson's comment on the ending of The Freeman , on p. 49 of his "Story of The Freeman ," referred to below. 9 "The Story of The Freeman ," a 53-page supplement to the American Journal of Economics and Sociology , vol. VI, no. 1 (October 1946). This is a more thorough and detailed account than the reminiscences of Nock and Brooks. 10 "A Short History of The Freeman , a Magazine of the Early Twenties, with Particular Attention to the Literary Criticism," Columbia Ph.D. dissertation, 1956—it is abstracted in DA , XVI (1956), 1258. Miss Turner describes the founding of the publication on pp. 1-43. In her note on p. 52 she indicates that she has used "the publisher's marked copy in attributing authorship"; but it was not her purpose to make any kind of thorough guide to the authorship. 11 I wish to thank Mr. Stanley Pargellis for giving me permission to publish the material in the Newberry copy and Mr. B. W. Huebsch for his kindness in allowing me to go through his copy in his home and for his helpfulness in answering questions. I wish also to thank Mrs. Gertrude Woodward and Mrs. Amy Nyholm of the Newberry Rare Book Room for their assistance, and Miss K. P. Evans for the information she supplied. 12 In most of these instances there is no real doubt. For example, in IV, 519-520, all paragraphs are marked as by Neilson except for the fifth paragraph on p. 519; though this is probably nothing but an oversight, Neilson's initials are enclosed in brackets below at IV, 519e. Similarly, brackets have been used around Nock's initials in the case of unmarked editorial paragraphs, this attribution based on the statement in the Huebsch copy (I, 481) that "all editorials not marked are by Mr. Nock." 13 Supported by two columns from this period assigned to Brooks in The Freeman Book : IV, 46-47 ( Freeman Book , pp. 365-370), and IV, 598-599 (pp. 370-377). 14 Supported once more by The Freeman Book , pp. 382-388—the column of VI, 454. 15 That is, the brief sections divided by short lines—these sometimes contain more than one paragraph. 16 In the Huebsch copy, this is attributed to AJN alone. 17 In the Huebsch copy, LL is marked out, but both sets of initials remain in the Newberry copy. 18 Not marked in Huebsch (which usually signifies AJN), but FN is given in Newberry. 19 Huebsch gives 51c-f to AJN; Newberry gives d-f to FN, but AJN is marked beside it in pencil. 20 In Newberry, 135b is credited to AJN. 21 The LCM attribution here is from Huebsch; Newberry gives it all to LMa. 22 Newberry continues AJN through 505d. 23 Newberry gives this item also to WGF. CDB; 534-5 AJN; 543-4 ESt. 24 The Freeman Book attributes 73a to AJN. 25 These initials are also written in the Huebsch copy at VII, 439, but have not been identified. 26 Newberry gives HSG at I, 406, to Frank W. Garrison. 27 Newberry assigns RP at I, 286, to Roth Robinson. 28 "The Myth of a Guilty Nation" series, usually signed "Historicus," carries Nock's name on IV, 253; the whole series was published in book form (New York: Huebsch, 1922) under his name. 29 "Journeyman" is the signature used each week for the "Miscellany" section. While it is more often by Nock than anyone else, it is frequently by others—even the individual paragraphs in the same column may be by different people. Authorship of the "Miscellany" paragraphs (and thus the shifting identity of "Journeyman") is indicated with the unsigned material in Section I and can be found by looking up the page numbers of particular "Miscellany" articles. 30 The reader looking for work by a particular author not listed in this index should, in the interests of thoroughness, also remember to check that author's initials in Part II, since not all the initials there have been identified and therefore not all of them are represented by names in the index.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Material for a Centenary Edition of Tenderis the Night by Matthew J. Bruccoli *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pre-publication history of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night is fascinating; the post-publication history of the text is appalling. As I have shown in The Composition of Tender is the Night , 1 the novel had twelve drafts of three different versions before it was serialized, and then it was heavily revised for book publication. 2 As issued in April 1934 the first printing included more than 100 substantive errors. No corrections were made in the two 1934 reprints, and only two corrections were made in the 1951 reprint. 3 The Scribner Library edition of 1960, the second Scribner's edition of the 1934 text, introduces six corrections and thirteen errors—even though Malcolm Cowley and his revised edition were both available for consulation. 4 Spot-checks of the non-Scribner's editions (see Pedigree of Editions of Tender is the Night ) reveal only irregular correction; and collation of eighty-four pages of the English first edition against the American shows twenty-four changes—of which eleven are English spellings, nine are corrections, and four are fresh errors. Obviously, most of the blame for the sloppy text of Tender is the Night belongs to Fitzgerald. Even at his best he was weak on the mechanical details of writing, and he read proof on this novel during a period of great personal strain. Moreover, his wholesale revising in proof would have made the job of copy-editing Tender is the Night difficult for even the most skilled editor. The book galleys were set directly from the unrevised serial, and then Fitzgerald proceeded to prepare the book by covering these galleys with revisions. Although all the book galleys have not survived, it is demonstrable that they had to be reset. 5 As Cowley notes, Maxwell Perkins was not the plodding editor this novel needed. Perkins "had an aristocratic disregard for details so long as a book was right in its feeling for life. Since Fitzgerald was regarded as one of his special authors, the manuscript was never copy-edited by others." 6 In 1951 Malcolm Cowley edited a new edition for Scribner's, "The Author's Final Version," based on Fitzgerald's marked dummy in which the story is re-arranged into straight chronological order. 7 Fitzgerald seems to have remained unaware of the concentration of errors in the text, for he made only four corrections—as opposed to revisions —in his copy. In 1936 when the Modern Library was considering reprinting the original plates Fitzgerald asked for permission to insert explanatory headings, but did not mention correcting the errors. 8 However, Cowley recognized the foul state of the text and undertook to clean it up in his edition. This chore he performed so painstakingly that his edition includes more than 900 variants from the first edition— but less than thirty of these he identifies in his notes. This edition also introduces thirteen new errors into the text. 9 Cowley is right in suggesting that the errors in the first edition have the cumulative effect of distracting the reader's attention, but he fails to recognize that his liberal position on silent emendation has the cumulative effect of offering the reader something less than straight Fitzgerald. Given the conditions of commercial publishing, Cowley probably never had the option of listing all his emendations. Nonetheless, the fact remains that an unwary critic could get into trouble with Cowley's text. There is more than spelling, grammar, and punctuation at stake, for Tender is the Night includes a group of chronological inconsistencies which seriously affect the reader's reaction to the novel. Some difficulty is caused by the inconsistencies in the ages of the characters; and Fitzgerald's inattention to the time-span of his story confuses Book III, which traces Dick's crack-up and which several critics have found unsatisfactory. It is essential that the reader be aware of the pace of Dick's collapse, but from the first edition it is hard to tell whether Book III occupies one or two years. We know from Fitzgerald's preliminary plan that the novel opens with Rosemary's arrival on the Riviera in June 1925 and ends with Dick's departure from the Riviera in July 1929. 10 But Fitzgerald seems to have confused four years with five summers. Thus, on page 276 he gives the year of Dick's Rome meeting with Rosemary as 1928, but on this page and on page 271 he adds an extra year to their ages. If the break-up of the Divers' marriage and Dick's abdication are to occur in the summer of 1929, then Book III occupies one year. At this point four years (but five summers) have passed since Rosemary and Dick first met—not five years, as Fitzgerald states on page 364. That this is the summer of 1929 gives Dick's crack-up an ironic significance in view of what will happen on Wall Street in October. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's carelessness or confusion blurred this effect. Indeed, Cowley is convinced that Fitzgerald changed the time-scheme of the novel after he drew up the preliminary plan, and that Tender is the Night does in fact cover five years: We will be told several times that five years have passed since Rosemary's first visit to the Cap d'Antibes in the summer of 1925. Her second visit, then, was in June, 1930. The date reveals a change in Fitzgerald's plans. . . . There is always a sense of historical events in the background of the novel . . . and many episodes in it have the color of a special year. At this point, however, the author needed more elapsed time to accomplish Dick's ruin—five years instead of four—and actually 1930 was better for the historical background than 1929. It was the year when, in spite of the crash, there were more rich Americans in Europe than ever before and when the summer season on the Riviera was the biggest and maddest. 11 Although Cowley does not account for the year 1929, his idea is supported by Fitzgerald's statement at the beginning of chapter four of Book III, "The Villa Diana had been rented again for the summer. . . ." 12 which indicates that a full year passes between the Divers' departure from the clinic and their return to the Riviera. But my feeling is that this is another piece of Fitzgerald's own confusion, of which there is ample evidence in the novel. The case for the four-year time-span rests on two points: it is extremely unlikely that Fitzgerald would not have mentioned the crash if it had occurred during the novel; and Tommy's statement on page 353 that his stocks are doing well hardly belongs to the summer of 1930. I do agree with Cowley's comment that the year 1926 is unaccounted for in the action of the first edition. 13 The trip to Gstaad occurs during December of 1925, and in chapter fourteen of Book II Fitzgerald states that Dick has been at the clinic for eighteen months, 14 which would make the time of this chapter June 1927. But since the Rome chapters that follow are specifically dated 1928, one year must be accounted for. Cowley suggests that the Divers remained on the Riviera during 1926 while the clinic was being renovated. However, it is possible that this is the point where Fitzgerald lost track of his time-scheme. If the Rome chapters are moved back to 1927, then Cowley can have his two years for Book III and I can have my pre-crash conclusion. I have not suggested this change in a projected edition, though, because Fitzgerald specifies that the Rome chapters take place in 1928. Since my study of the composition of Tender is the Night has convinced me that the structure of "The Author's Final Version" does not represent Fitzgerald's best judgment, the first edition should be used as the copy-text for a projected critical edition. Thus all page references in my tables are to the first edition. The list of Emendations to be Made in the First-Edition Copy-Text includes all changes—substantive, accidental, and typographical—that I would make in the first edition. Except in cases where there is a possibility of confusion I have resisted improving Fitzgerald's punctuation. His punctuation by ear and eye is frequently wrong, but it was his system and part of the texture of his work. In this list the first reading is the emendation to be made in the copy-text; the bracket is followed by the rejected reading(s) and its sources. The Emendations list is based on the first edition and records only the changes required in that text. Asterisked entries are discussed in the Textual Notes. The Historical Collation records only substantive variants among the three editions published by Scribner's (1934, Cowley 1951, and Scribner Library 1960). Like the Emendations list, the Historical Collation is based on the copy-text. The first reading is that of a definitive edition; following the bracket are the rejected readings and their sources. The serial has been used only as a check on variants in these three editions. The Historical Collation does not include all variants between the serial and the first edition, since these would be both voluminous and distracting.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Textual Notes 24.19-23 I have rejected the author's plan for moving this passage to p. 157 (see list of revisions in Fitzgerald's copy) because the revision seems based on Fitzgerald's desire to get a good description of Dick near the front of "The Author's Final Version." 24.30 As Cowley notes, Campion's first name, Luis, is Spanish. 61.10 "I wouldn't miss it for words" is not idiomatic, but I have retained words because it appears in every draft of the passage, and it is possible that Fitzgerald intended to characterize Campion by this word choice. 119.10,12 Cowley notes that the name of the shop was Aux Cent Mille Chemises . 119.30 I can discover no appropriate incident associated with Ferrara. Henry Dan Piper has suggested to me that Fitzgerald may have been thinking of the penance performed by the emperor Henry IV before Pope Gregory at Canossa in 1077. 120.1-122.6 See list of revisions in Fitzgerald's copy and his "Analysis of Tender ." As noted below, this deletion requires additional cuts at 399.24-25, 29-33. 128.17 As Cowley notes, at 139.11 the scene of the dispute is given as Montparnasse. It is difficult to tell whether this contradiction resulted from Abe's condition or Fitzgerald's carelessness. 128.18 As Cowley notes, at 139.2 Peterson's home is given as Stockholm. Again, it is difficult to tell whether the error was Abe's or the author's. 157.13-15 See note on 24.19-23. 157.16 I have rejected the author's insertion of Dick said because it is unnecessary to identify the speaker if the change at 157.13-15 is not made (see list of revisions in Fitzgerald's copy). 162.21 Since farcical is correctly spelled at 211.6 and 248.17 it is possible— but not very likely—that Fitzgerald deliberately mis-spelled it in Nicole's letter. 167.7 Nicole's mother could not have died when she was eleven because at 72.19 Nicole mentions having been in Berlin with her mother when she was thirteen. 193.17 The Swiss National Tourist Office informs me that there is no Jugenhorn in Switzerland. Cowley emends to Dent Du Midi , which Dick could have seen from Montreux. 197.19 Baby can't be twenty-five here because she is twenty-four at 186.18. 212.9, 23-24 I have rejected the author's emendations at these points because they seem designed to provide information for the reader of "The Author's Final Version" (see list of revisions in Fitzgerald's copy). 226.5 Baby must be more than thirty because this is 1925, and she was twenty-four in 1918. 227.23 This is the only place Fitzgerald spells the name Gregorovius . Cowley changes the spelling to Gregorovius in all appearances on the ground that Gregorovious "is highly improbable in German." Nevertheless I have retained Gregorovious —as I have resisted changing Chillicheff to Chillichev —because it is a made-up name. 230.11 The sense here requires Gregorovious to have examined the books. Since have appears in the manuscripts and typescripts before the serial, it is probable that haven't was a typo Fitzgerald missed. 238.1 Dick is thirty-seven because this is 1928, and Fitzgerald's preliminary plan states that he was born in 1891. 238.15 Cowley emends to ego , but Fitzgerald wrote ergo in the drafts, which is possible in the sense of "activity-therapy." 239.30 Fitzgerald wrote instructed in his manuscript, but the sense of the passage requires uninstructed . 246.22 The Divers have been married nine years. This is 1928, and they were married in 1919. 259.11 McKibben speaks on p. 260, so he can't leave on p. 259. 271.14 It has been three years since Dick and Rosemary first met. This is 1928, and they met in 1925. 271.16 Rosemary and Dick were eighteen and thirty-four in 1925; they are twenty-one and thirty-seven in 1928. 291.12 Clay is a Georgian, but it is possible that his father's firm was in Birmingham. 301.18 It is possible—but extremely unlikely—that the Italian words on p. 301 were mis-spelled to show Baby's mispronunciations. 317.3 This is fall-winter 1928, so Dick—who was born in 1891—is not yet forty. 320.17 Charles Marquis Warren has written me (5 August 1959) that Nicole's father was originally named Charles Warren after him, but that Fitzgerald changed his mind. 331.2-3 If another summer passes at this point, the novel will occupy an extra year. See the discussion of the time-scheme above. 331.11 Fitzgerald's preliminary plan states that Lanier was born in August 1920 and Topsy in June 1922. This 1928, and they are eight and six. 332.13 Topsy is six in 1928. See note on 331.11. 332.29-341.11 In his "Analysis of Tender " Fitzgerald indicated that he planned to delete the whole visit with Mary; but, as explained below, I have retained this material because Fitzgerald provided no substitute explanation for the bad feeling between Dick and Mary. 337.11 El is Spanish masculine. 348.6 I have not found a Corps d'Afrique du Nord . There was a Corps Franc d'Afrique , but it was a penal unit, as was the Bataillon d'Afrique . Since Tommy is apparently referring to the film Beau Geste , the general term for the French Foreign Legion seems best here. 352.3 Although lesion does not seem quite right here, it is the word Fitzgerald wrote in his manuscript. Cowley's emendation to lessening reverses the meaning of the sentence. 364.5,8,14 This is the summer of 1929. It has been four years or five summers since Dick and Rosemary met in the summer of 1925. 391.28 Cowley changes the spelling to Sibley in all appearances. 399.24-25,29-33 If Dick's earlier encounter with the news-vendor is cut from 120.1-122.6, then these passages in which Dick recognizes him must also be cut. 401.21 In 1936 when the novel was being considered for the Modern Library, Fitzgerald wrote Bennett Cerf, "There is not more than one complete sentence that I want to eliminate, one that has offended many people and that I admit is out of Dick's character: 'I never did go in for making love to dry loins.' It is a strong line but definitely offensive" (Cowley, p. 356). The present editor cannot bring himself to kill this sentence. Special Note : One class of error has not been dealt with in the Emendations list, and this is the repetition of phrases which resulted from Fitzgerald's habit of inserting good phrases from his stories into his novels. There are three instances of this repetition in Tender is the Night : at pp. 33 and 89 the description of Nicole's hair; at pp. 35 and 69 the words "compromises of how many years"; and at pp. 138 and 204 the description of a kiss.</field>

The following entry from Fitzgerald's notebooks shows the revised structure of "The Author's Final Version" and indicates that he planned to omit two passages: Dick's encounter with the news-vendor in Paris (actually pp. 120-122), and the Divers' visit to Mary North Minghetti (pp. 322-341). 15 I have followed Cowley in deleting the first of these, which necessitated making two other deletions on page 399 (see Textual Notes). I have also followed Cowley in retaining the Minghetti material because cutting it would leave the reader ignorant of the reason for the bad feeling between Dick and Mary at the end of the novel.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Copyright © 1963 by Matthew J. Bruccoli. All rights reserved. 1 University of Pittsburgh Press, 1963. 2 Tender is the Night was serialized in four installments in Scribner's Magazine , January-April 1934. There are 183 differences between the serial and the first six chapters of the book. 3 There were three printings in 1934: 2 April 7,600; 11 April 5,075; and 4 May 2, 520. 300 (?) copies of the first printing were issued as advance copies in wrappers. The first printing is easily identified by the A on the copyright page, but I have not been able to differentiate the second and third printings. The first printing appears in two bindings—the standard B cloth and the uncommon T cloth—but this difference is without textual significance. The two plate changes in the first edition are at 320.17 and 344.7—see the Historical Collation. It is worth mentioning that Clifton Fadi-man's review of the novel listed thirteen spelling errors ( The New Yorker , X [14 April 1934], 96, 98, 99). 4 The errors in the Scribner Library edition are: 32.31 eveyone; 49.6 rabit; 68.19 Gerogian; 69.33 now. ˄; 69.38 sot; 82.29 Not; 118.5 looling; 120.7 Kreuzegg; 167.3 might; 168.20 Gausses; 261.30 person-; 311.28 righ; 314.17 "As.

Only 145.21 was corrected, but in the separate edition and not in the Modern Standard Authors volume. In the first printing of Cowley the introduction included four typos: xi.18 xett; xiv.19 tsandards; xviii.23 b each; xviii.24 accompanied. Review copies were sent out with an "Erratum Slip" and the trade copies had the three pages corrected by cancels. But subsequent printings included all four typos, and the earliest printing I have found with the corrections on integral pages is the tenth printing of September 1959. 10 Fitzgerald's "General Plan" is with the Tender is the Night manuscripts at the Princeton University Library. It contains contradictory information about the time-span of the novel. The ages of Dick and Nicole are reckoned in four and five-year spans, and the ages of Rosemary and Tommy only in five-year spans. In two places Fitzgerald states that the story ends in July 1929. 11 Cowley, p. 355. 12 P. 331. 13 Cowley, p. 352. 14 P. 238. 15 Fitzgerald's notebooks are in the Princeton University Library. 16 My thanks are due to the following impressed crewmen: Alexander Clark, Mrs. F.

      <field name="heading_text">The Terence of Turin, 1483 by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nearly a quarter of a millennium ago, Michael Maittaire 1 listed an edition of the Comedies of Terence, the imprint of which (it was set forth) proclaimed that the volume had been printed in Turin by Johannes Fabri on Tuesday, 23 June 1483. This reference was taken over into the bibliographies of Georg Wolfgang Panzer, 2 Ludwig Hain, 3 Francesco Cosentini, 4 and others. 5 It may be of equal interest to recall that precisely a century has passed since it was first strongly suggested that the edition of 1483 was really a supposititious one. Another edition of Terence from the same press, however, also noted by the early bibliographers has a very real existence. This bears the imprint: Turin: Johannes Fabri, Tuesday, 23 June 1478, and may be identified as Panzer III, 44, 6; Hain 15379; and Cosentini 24. Dr. Dennis E. Rhodes 6 has shown that, about the year 1800, two copies of this Terence could be definitely located. The one which is now in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Turin 7 may (perhaps) be the very copy which, prior to 1819, belonged to the Seminario of Asti—but the Robert Hoblyn-Michael Wodhull 8 one seems to have completely disappeared from sight. Nevertheless, it is certain, as Giacomo Manzoni has remarked, 9 that this Terence is truly "rarissimo," and no copy was registered either by the Kommission für den Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke 10 nor in the files of the Centro Nazionale di Informazioni Bibliografiche in Rome. 11 The first, so far as the writer is aware, to question the existence of the 1483 printing was Manzoni 12 who, in 1863, declared that "la seconda delle due edizioni è supposta, imperocchè, cadendo in martedì il 23 giugno del 1478, non poteva il 23 giugno del 1483 cadere nello stesso giorno." The same comment was also put forward by the British Museum's incunabula catalogue, 13 but here it was more explicitly asserted that, in 1483, June 23rd fell on a Monday, not on a Tuesday as the colophon specifies. A printer may well go wrong, in his colophon, on the roman date of the year—as many, indeed, did—but it does not seem likely that a craftsman would slip up on so simple and practical a matter as to the day of the week upon which he completed his labors. Manzoni suggested that the origin of this "ghost" might be sought in a slip made either by Maittaire or by his source, his conjecture being that the date of 1483 was due to a misreading of "M.cccc.lxxviii" as "M.cccc. lxxxiii". Quite possibly this may be the true explanation for this date, such misreadings being common enough in the history of bibliography. But another explanation may be found in the copy now in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Accession no. 52923). Here a hole torn in the last leaf makes the reading of the colophon uncertain, as may be seen in the appended cut. Clearly the roman date can here be read either as 1478 or 1483, and a conservative bibliographer, with this copy in hand, might well have judged the later date to be the more likely one. The Morgan volume thus provides another possible explanation for the genesis of this ghost edition of Terence, albeit at best only a speculative one.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printer of the 1594 Octavo of Marlowe's Edward II by Robert Ford Welsh</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The printer of the earliest known edition of Marlowe's Edward II , an octavo of 1594, is not named in either the imprint (on A1) or the colophon (on M3) of the book: (A1) Imprinted at London for William Iones | dwelling neere Holbourne conduit, at the | signe of the Gunne . 1594. (M3) Imprinted at London for William | Ihones, and are to be solde at his | shop, neere vnto Houlburne | Conduit. 1594 . The printer of the octavo has usually been assigned as Richard Bradock for the reason that the next known edition, a quarto of 1598 bearing Bradock's name in the imprint, has two ornaments in common with the 1594 octavo: the head-piece which appears above the head title on A2 of the 1594 octavo heads the title page (A2) of the 1598 quarto; and the diamond-shaped ornament appearing above the colophon on M3 of the 1594 octavo appears below the middle of the title page of the 1598 quarto. Richard Bradock, however, was not the printer of the 1594 octavo of Edward II ; for the ornaments which appear in the octavo, and in Bradock's quarto of 1598, belonged to Robert Robinson in 1594. In fact, it is doubtful that Richard Bradock printed anything in 1594. If the entries for Bradock in Morrison's Index to the STC and the Index to Arber's Transcript are complete, no extant book printed between 1593 and 1596 bears Bradock's name in the imprint; nor does any entry in the Stationers' Register during those years contain Bradock's name. 1 Robert Robinson, on the other hand, was reasonably active as a printer during these years and was using the ornaments which appear in the 1594 octavo of Edward II . In a Latin work printed by Robinson in 1594, Institutiones Linguae Graecae (STC 5403), appear all three of the ornaments which are present in the 1594 octavo of Edward II : the head-piece above the head title in Edward II appears on A8 v of the Institutiones ; 2 the diamond-shaped ornament above the colophon in Edward II appears no less than three times in the Institutiones ; 3 and a circular ornament which appears on the title page of Edward II appears on A7 of the Institutiones . 4 Further, the initial M which appears at the beginning of the text on A2 of Edward II appears in a work 5 printed by Robinson in 1596. There is evidence bearing on the question of how Robinson's ornaments passed to Richard Bradock and thus into Bradock's 1598 edition of Edward II . First, it is likely that Robinson went out of business as a printer in 1597 or early 1598; the last entry to him in the Stationers' Register is dated 2 May 1597 (Arber, III.84), and no extant book dated later than 1597 bears Robinson's name in the imprint (Morrison, Index ). Second, in the "rough Memoranda of Sir John Lambe," written about 1635 and included in Arber's Transcript , Richard Bradock is said to have married the widow of Robert Robinson (Arber, III.702). Since Robinson's ornaments appear in Bradock's books of 1598, 6 it is a reasonable conjecture that Robert Robinson died in 1597 or early 1598 and that his widow was not without a husband for long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 If the entry for Bradock in Morrison's Index is complete, Bradock's name appears in the imprint of one extant book dated 1581, two dated 1592, and one dated 1597. It is on 8 April 1598, however, that a book is first assigned to Bradock in the Stationers' Register (Arber, III.110); and no less than twelve extant books of 1598 bear Bradock's name in the imprint. A possible reason for this blossoming of Bradock's career in 1598 is given at the conclusion of this note. 2 This ornament also appears in a book printed by Robinson in 1591 (STC 3508). It appears twice in each of two books printed by Robinson, one of 1595 (STC 4098) and one of 1596 (STC 20635). The ornament appears three times in each of two books printed by Robinson in 1596 (STC 20634, 20636). 3 The ornament appears on the following pages of the Institutiones : Aa8 v (also numbered 368), Cc1 v (386), Ii1 (481). The ornament also appears in three other books printed by Robinson: STC 4098, printed in 1595; STC 18013, 18246, printed in 1596. 4 This circular ornament also appears in the following books printed by Robinson: STC 3508, printed in 1591; STC 362, 1098, 18246, printed in 1596. 5 An Alphabet of the Holy Proverbes of King Salomon (STC 362). The initial appears on F1 v . 6 The diamond-shaped ornament appears not only in the 1598 quarto of Edward II , but in two other books printed by Bradock in 1598 (STC 4172, 24890). The circular ornament used by Robinson in the 1594 edition of Edward II and elsewhere appears in three books printed by Bradock in 1598 (STC 4172, 6819, 24890). Further, two of Robinson's devices included in McKerrow's Printers' and Publishers' Devices (Nos. 207, 280) appear in books printed by Bradock in 1598 (No. 207 in STC 1823, 21225; No. 280 in STC 12372). Of these two devices, and of a third, No. 202, McKerrow says "Probably passed to Richard Bradock in 1597-8."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Early Editions of Sir Walter Ralegh's The History of the World by John Racin, Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No student of Sir Walter Ralegh can fail to profit from the detailed researches of Dr. T. N. Brushfield (1828-1910), who published a series of biographical-bibliographical studies of Ralegh, the most important of which describe the circumstances of the writing and suppression of Ralegh's The History of the World and provide bibliographical data on its editions. 1 Unfortunately, Brushfield's work has led to a number of misconceptions which have been tenaciously long-lived. The purpose here is to examine the story of the printing, suppression, and reprinting of the History . The "facts" of the story, established mainly by Brushfield and accepted by Sir Charles Firth 2 and a host of modern biographers, may be simply summarized. Ralegh, condemned to the Tower in 1603 under the sentence of death, began his universal history in about 1607. 3 The work was entered in the Stationers' Register April 15, 1611, but did not appear until March, 1614. 4 Its popularity was immediate. Having roused James's anger, however, it was suppressed by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, December 22, 1614. James was especially incensed by the fact that Ralegh, a man "civilly dead," had the "impudence" (to use Firth's term) to have his portrait engraved on the title-page. However, a compromise was soon reached. The government rescinded the suppression order with the stipulation that the title-page be removed to render the work anonymous. The first edition ( STC 20637), printed by William Stansby for Walter Burre, was then re-issued, possibly three times. The second edition ( STC 20637 a ), also printed by Stansby for Burre, appeared in 1614 with all of the errata of the first edition corrected. In 1617 two more editions were printed (several modern biographers have claimed three), one by Stansby for Burre ( STC 20638) and the other by William Jaggard for Burre ( STC 20638 a ). Of these, according to Brushfield, the Jaggard contained the portrait title-page, which now reappeared for the first time since the initially suppressed Stansby 1614 edition. Brushfield also stated that the Jaggard 1617 was revised by Ralegh, a claim which has caused it to be regarded by some as the most authoritative text. Jaggard then re-issued the work in 1621 ( STC 20639). In its major details the story is untenable. It is based largely on conjecture and on questionable, even careless, bibliographical procedures. This study will consider the following points: (1) the suppression, (2) the "issues" of the Stansby 1614 and the "second" Stansby 1614, (3) the relations between the Stansby 1614 and 1617 editions, (4) the relations between the Stansby 1617 and the Jaggard 1617 and 1621 editions. It will be argued that no compromise with suppression took place, that the "issues" are actually variant states, that the "second" Stansby 1614 is a ghost, and that the "Jaggard 1617" is a ghost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Suppression Ralegh's biographers have been deeply concerned with the suppression of the History . Until 1894, when Arber printed Abbot's order, the most authoritative evidence for suppression was provided in a letter of John Chamberlain dated January 5, 1615: "Sir Walter Raleighs booke is called in by the Kinges commaundment, for divers exceptions, but specially for beeing too sawcie in censuring princes. I heare he takes yt much to hart, for he thought he had won his spurres and pleased the king extraordinarilie." 5 Even though Chamberlain's report was generally accepted before Brushfield and William Stebbing both questioned its reliability, several questions seemed to require explanation. Why was the Stansby 1614 published anonymously? If suppression took place, why were so many copies of this edition extant? Before he knew of the suppression order, Brushfield took these two facts (anonymous publication and the existence of numerous copies) and in 1887 offered a conjecture: Had the work been really suppressed, few copies of the original edition of 1614 ought now to be met with. As a matter of fact, it appears to be fully as common as any of the later ones. The British Museum Library possesses two copies, and there are two in my own collection. Suppression is inconsistent with — 1st, there being two distinct issues of the early edition, one with a list of errata on the last leaf facing the index, the other without any, but having the errata corrected in the text [emphasis added]; 6 and, 2nd, the publication of another edition three years later. A careful consideration of these facts will, I think, warrant our drawing the conclusion, that although the work was "called in" by royal command, such a command must have been soon rescinded. We may, however, advance a step beyond this. There appears to be something more than probability in the conjecture that all hindrances to the sale of the work were removed on the understanding that it should be published without the name of the author — anonymously — and this was effected in a very simple manner by omitting the title-page, and all copies of the original edition that have been preserved are destitute of one. ( Trans. Devon. Assoc. , XIX, 406) Stebbing, however, was unpersuaded. In 1891 he answered: "The surmise is ingenious; but it is very hard to believe that such an arrangement, if made, would have excited no discussion. Chamberlain's language, moreover, implies that the book was already in circulation. It would be exceedingly strange if its previous purchasers had the docility to eliminate the title-page from their copies, in deference to an order certainly not very emphatically promulgated." Stebbing concluded by impugning Chamberlain's reliability. "The readiest explanation is that Chamberlain, in his haste to give his correspondent early information, reported to him a rumour, and perhaps a threat, upon which James happily had not the hardihood to act." 7 When Abbot's order was printed, thus vindicating Chamberlain, Brushfield in 1894 interpreted the order as confirmation of his original conjecture. "In a paper of mine . . . read in 1887 . . . , I expressed the opinion that as Ralegh's work was certainly not suppressed, some kind of compromise was probably arranged with the publisher, and this was effected by removing the title-page, and thus virtually converting it into an anonymous one. This view appears to be corroborated by the document which Prof. Arber has brought to light. Is it capable of any other explanation?" ( N. &amp; Q. , 8th S., V, 442). In 1904, however, perhaps realizing that his original conjecture was scarcely supportable, he withdrew it, thus reopening the question of anonymous publication and suppression. In my former paper I suggested that, in lieu of suppression, a compromise was probably agreed upon, by the elimination of the printed title-page, so as to render the work anonymous; and its absence in the first two editions seemed to bear this out [emphasis added]. 8 Stebbing points out the difficulties attending the enforcement of a royal order for the book to be called in, as it had been for some time in circulation; but the discovery of the de facto order rather adds to than diminishes the difficulty of assigning any reason for the absent title-page. ( Trans. Devon. Assoc. , XXXVI, 185) In spite of Brushfield's 1904 withdrawal (admittedly less than candid), the damage had been done. In 1918 Firth took up Brushfield's 1887 conjecture and transformed it into fact, and embellished the fact. He wrote: in spite of these objections to the History , the suppression was merely temporary. The government contented itself with the removal of the title-page, which contained the author's portrait as well as his name, and no alterations or omissions in the text were ordered. This excision is not difficult to explain. Raleigh was a state prisoner condemned to death for high treason, owing his life to the King's mercy; respited, not pardoned. He was a man 'civilly dead,' as it was alleged. Yet he had the impudence to show that he was very much alive, not only by writing a great book, which might have been winked at, but by putting his name and even his portrait on the title-page. ( Essays , p. 55) Ralegh's more recent biographers (and others such as F. A. Mumby in his Publishing and Bookselling , rev. ed. [1954], p. 97) have accepted the story without question. It was repeated by Milton Waldman ( Sir Walter Raleigh [1928], p. 193), D. B. Chidsey ( Sir Walter Ralegh : That Damned Upstart [1931], p. 258), Edward Thompson ( Sir Walter Ralegh : Last of the Elizabethans [1936], p. 259), Willard Wallace ( Sir Walter Ralegh [1959], p. 250), and most recently by Margaret Irwin ( That Great Lucifer [1960], p. 236). Thus a bibliographical conjecture has become an historical fact. And the "fact" in turn proved Ralegh's "impudence" and purportedly helped to explain James's wrath. What then can be said about anonymous publication and suppression? If Camden's word for March as the month of publication is correct, the History was on sale for nine months before the suppression order; yet if the copies sold in this period possessed the printed title-page, why have none survived? Copies of this edition are plentiful; yet not one has been found containing a printed title-page. 9 Furthermore, the simple bibliographical fact is that there is no evidence that the printed title-page was cancelled. The preliminaries of the Stansby 1614 consist of two unsigned conjugate leaves. The first leaf contains Ben Jonson's "The Minde of the Front," verses which interpret the allegory of the engraved title-page. The second leaf bears the engraved title-page, which has the title "THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD" lettered across the center and the imprint at the bottom "At London Printed for Walter Bvrre. / 1614." In the preliminaries of all subsequent editions up to 1652, the printed title-page follows the engraved one. This order seems to have been the usual one for those books which possess both. In the "Jaggard 1617" the preliminaries consist of a gathering of two folds. The inner fold contains "The Minde of the Front" and the engraved title-page; the outer fold contains the printed title-page on the recto of the fourth leaf. In the Stansby 1617, a reprint of the 1614 and the first actually to possess a printed title-page, the title-page is a single leaf inserted after the engraving (in the Folger copy the conjugate blank leaf which would complete the outer fold may have been lost). In any case the important point is that the makeup of all subsequent editions to 1652 indicates that had the bound Stansby 1614 contained a printed title-page it would have followed the engraved one; thus evidence of cancel would be present in extant copies. No such evidence appears. It must be assumed that the History appeared in 1614 without a printed title-page. The causes of James's anger and the suppression are not difficult to surmise. Ralegh lived only through the "mercy" of James. In this precarious position to pass fierce judgments on the crimes of monarchs, 10 to paint Henry VIII as the pattern of a "merciless Prince" (II, xvi-vii), to provide examples of the overthrow of tyrannies (VI, 50-75, 130-136), to speak of monarchy in terms suggestive of constitutional limitations (II, 339-352), and to lament for the monarch's ungrateful treatment of England's patriot soldiers, carefully excepting James, but the inference was plain (VII, 789-790), all this quite understandably irritated the inflexible champion of divine right. The attitude of James was certain to influence the practice of historians. Camden, with all his devotion to historical truth, stated in the preface to The History . . . of Princesse Elizabeth : "THE HIDDEN MEANINGS OF PRINCES . . . and if they worke any thing more secretly, to search them out, it is vnlawfull; it is doubtful &amp; dangerous; pursue not therefore the search thereof." 11 Ralegh, qua historian, took a bolder view. Whether the historian's subject matter was ancient or modern made no difference in terms of its moral, political, or practical relevance. All past events were seen within an immutable framework created by an immutable God, whose judgments determined history. Thus any example, no matter how ancient, had its contemporary meaning if one knew how to search for it. Since this view of history was a commonplace shared by Ralegh's contemporaries (who had not learned to judge "historically" in a universe of change or becoming), they could, as well as James, note Ralegh's judgments on the deeds of monarchs and draw their own conclusions or parallels; and drawing such parallels was dangerous. James had noted Ralegh's treatment of kings. In a letter to Sir Robert Carr, James alluded to "Sir Walter Ralegh's description of the kings that he hates, of whom he speaketh but evil." 12 It is improbable that James "compromised" with a man he feared and rescinded his suppression order with the stipulation that the printed title-page be removed. Such a weak measure would not have changed the possible influence of Ralegh's remarks on monarchs, nor would it have rendered the work truly anonymous. Scarcely a chapter of the History is without a Raleghian observation on his own experience: his relations with Prince Henry, his defense of the daring landing at Fayal, his answer to charges of Puritanism, his praise of exploratory voyages. From internal evidence alone few authors could have been easier to identify by a Londoner. Also, what would have prevented a bookseller from revealing the identity of the author, then the most famous inmate of the Tower, in order to stimulate sales? We may conclude that the suppression order most likely remained in force until Ralegh's conditional release from the Tower in 1616.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Issues" of the Stansby 1614 The possibility of the re-issue of the Stansby 1614 is intimately related to the supression question. We have seen that Brushfield doubted the suppression on the basis of his discovery of "issues." Initially he identified two "issues," the first containing errata and the second (termed the "second edition" in the STC and the British Museum Catalogue ) having the errata corrected. This "second edition" is a ghost. In reality it is a Stansby 1617. It was miscatalogued in the British Museum because although it contains the dated engraved title-page, it lacks a colophon. In 1897 the British Museum acquired a copy of the Stansby 1617, the original error was discovered, and it was recatalogued as an imperfect copy of the Stansby 1617. 13 The STC , however, compiled from the Short-Title Catalogue of English Books in the Library of the British Museum . . . to the year 1640 (1884), perpetuated the original error. Brushfield must have discovered his error in 1897, for he never mentioned this particular "second issue" again. Nevertheless, in subsequent papers he did not warn of his previous erroneous descriptions. Ralegh scholars, probably following the STC , have repeated the error many times. In 1904 Brushfield advanced a new argument for three, possibly four, issues ( Trans. Devon. Assoc. , XXXVI, 189-191). To classify what he termed Nos. I, II, and III Issues, he presented the variant readings for each. This claim was allowed to stand until doubts concerning his use of "issue" were raised in the Pforzheimer Catalogue account of the Stansby 1614. The account noted that six of the readings Brushfield cited which distinguished Nos. II and III from I did not appear (according to Brushfield's own testimony) on reset pages. In addition the seven reset pages which Brushfield cited as indicative of No. II were not reset in the Pforzheimer copy even though this copy possessed "all the distinctive readings of Brushfield's second 'issue' and none of his first or third" (III, 847). In my examination of the Folger copy and the two copies in The Lilly Library of Indiana University, it became apparent that Brushfield's classification actually records variant states in individual copies. Unlike the Pforzheimer copy, which conforms to Brushfield's No. II, the three copies, which differ from each other, individually contain readings of all of Brushfield's "issues." In the Folger copy the pages noted by Brushfield were not reset. The changes occur in the midst of the same type setting (not by cancels) and thus are press corrections. The corrected state of O4 v follows Brushfield's No. I; the corrected 4Z6 v , 3A1, 3B3 v , D6 v , and 5I2 follow Brushfield's II; the corrected G1 v , 2X5, 4O1, and 6O5 follow II and III; the uncorrected 2A4 and 6P4 follow Brushfield's hypothesized issue preceding I; and the corrected 5K6 v follows none of Brushfield's issues. Fredson Bowers has indicated: ". . . press-alterations in the text can constitute only variant states of the press-altered formes concerned. Press-correction in the text of hand-printed books is so common that when it is combined with indiscriminate binding of the sheets no state of the book as a whole can result, let alone separate issues." 14 And this is precisely the case with the Stansby 1614. Thus one 1614 edition containing numerous states was printed, and it was not re-issued. The suppression order apparently remained in force.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Stansby 1614 and 1617 Editions After Ralegh's release from the Tower in March, 1616, the Stansby 1617 (the true second edition) appeared — a page for page reprint of 1614 except for an inserted leaf in the preliminaries and some altered catchwords. The Folger copy of the Stansby 1617 contains a printed title-page (nothing suggests it was not part of the volume as it was first bound). This fact deserves notice because Brushfield lapsed into self-contradictions in his discussion of the title-page. In 1894 he stated that the "sole appreciable difference" between the two editions is that the 1617 contains a title-page ( N. &amp; Q. , 8th S., V, 441-442). Yet in his 1908 Bibliography (p. 90), without any explanation, he reversed himself. He then stated that the title-page is absent from the Stansby 1617 and that it first appeared in what he termed the "1617 (2) edition," the edition printed by Jaggard ( STC 20638 a ). Despite Brushfield's conflicting descriptions, the Stansby 1617 was the first to contain the portrait title-page. Its appearance at this time, doubtless with Ralegh's permission, indicates that Ralegh had risen from his "civill death," at least nominally; a development which underlines the irony of his execution in 1618. Since the Stansby 1617 was the last to appear in Ralegh's lifetime, the vital question concerns the possibility of authorial revision. No such revisions took place, a fact which is not surprising. In the interval between Ralegh's release from the Tower and his departure from London in March, 1617, he was preparing for his voyage to Orinoco, a gamble upon which his fortune and very life were to depend. Permission for the voyage had been wrung from the reluctant James, "no frend to the journey," and almost immediately Ralegh left London in haste fearing a royal countermand. 15 It is inconceivable that Ralegh took time to see the work through the press, a work, it should be remembered, which had proved a major disappointment to Ralegh's hopes of pleasing James. If Ralegh could not gratify James's "love of learning," he now would take all risks to gratify James's need of gold. The differences between the two Stansby editions resulted from the printer's fairly diligent efforts to improve on the first edition. He was able to include a printed title-page. The nine errata in the Preface were corrected. Of the 131 errata listed in the Errata, 107 were corrected, twenty-one were not (no Errata warns of this), and three new readings were introduced (two errors and one minor improvement). Two of the five pagination errors were corrected in Bks. I-II, but two new ones were made in Bks. III-V. The three signature errors were corrected. Two running-title errors in "The Contents" were corrected, but four in the text were not. In a side by side comparison of the Folger copies of the editions, except for minor alterations in spelling and punctuation, no other differences were detected. Thus the 1617 is a reprint. The substantive edition is the 1614.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Stansby 1617, the "Jaggard 1617" and the Jaggard 1621 The first notice of the "Jaggard 1617" ( STC 20638 a ) was given by Brushfield in 1886 ( The Western Antiquity , V, 244). Sabin, on the strength of Brushfield's notice, listed it in his dictionary, but indicated that he had not seen it ( Bibliotheca , XVI, 259-260). Brushfield said of this edition in 1908: "It is the first with a title-page headed ' The History of the World in fiue Bookes by sir Walter Ralegh, Knight.' Occupying more than one half of it is a portrait of Ralegh. . . . We may take it for granted that this edition was revised by him." 16 Even though he gave no supporting evidence, Brushfield's conclusion has stood unchallenged. On the basis of this claim, some have come to regard it as the most authoritative text, which no doubt has caused much inconvenience since it is by far the rarest. 17 Brushfield's conclusion, however, is false. The relations between the Stansby 1617 and the "Jaggard 1617" and 1621 ( STC 20639) show not only that Ralegh did not revise, but that the "Jaggard 1617" is a ghost. The spectral nature of the "Jaggard 1617" is proved by two conditions: the same type-pages printed both Jaggard texts; the copy-text of the Jaggard edition was the Stansby 1617. I have examined the Williams College Library copy of the "Jaggard 1617." It collates: 2 0 , π 4 A-B 6 C 4 a 6 b 8 A-S 6 T-V 4 , 2A-5Z 6 ¶ 6 ¶¶ 6 * 6 ** 8 . 18 I have compared photostats of twelve selected pages from the Yale, Cambridge University, and British Museum copies with the Williams copy. The same type-pages printed all four copies. Each bears the colophon: "London / Printed by William Iaggard for Walter / Burre, and are to be sold at his Shop in Paules Church-/yard at the signe of the Crane. / 1617." Moreover, I have compared side by side the Jaggard texts and can confirm Brushfield's description of them as identical. 19 Both contain the two title-pages. The date in the colophon is the only means of distinguishing between the two, except for two signature variations (1617 [A] as B is corrected in the 1621; 1617 **2 is erroneously ** in the 1621) and for two pagination variations (1617 [473] as 437 and [448] as 484 are corrected in the 1621). The 1621 colophon page (not a cancel) is identical with the "1617" except that the date was reset; nothing else was. The same type-pages printed both Jaggard texts including the colophons. However, in order to classify the Jaggard 1621 as a re-impression of the "Jaggard 1617," as Brushfield did ( Bibliography , p. 91), one must assume that the Jaggard 1621 was printed from standing type (the type-pages complete with furniture kept inactive four years). Such an assumption is, of course, absurd. Therefore the conclusion must be drawn that the "Jaggard 1617" was printed after 1617. This conclusion is proven by the relations between the Stansby 1617 and the Jaggard edition. The differences between the two editions resulted from the efforts to reduce costs, which evidently were formidable. 20 The size of the folio was reduced by some hundred leaves, mainly through increasing the number of lines per page from fifty-four to fifty-eight. Nothing in the text was omitted. That Jaggard used the Stansby 1617 as his copy text is shown by an analysis of the original 131 errata. Of these readings the Jaggard follows the text of the Stansby 1614 three times. It follows the corrections of the Errata three times. It introduces two new errors. It follows the text of the Stansby 1617 123 times. Of these 123 readings, 104 are corrections. Seventeen are original errata which were uncorrected in the Stansby 1617. The remaining two readings are substantive errors introduced in the Stansby 1617. 21 No other source exists. The following examples are typical of many which reveal that Jaggard's compositors used the Stansby 1617 with (as the second example shows) an occasional glance at the 1614 Errata page. First are listed the erratum and correction of the Errata page, then the readings in the Stansby and Jaggard texts. erratum To confirme them in this opinion . M. Bœbius correction To confirme them in this opinion , M. Bœbius [without any breaking] Stansby 1614 To confirme them in this opinion. / M. Bœbius [the line is completed to the right margin] (Bks. III-V, p. 575, ll. 14-15) Stansby 1617 To confirme them in this/opinion. [line blank to right margin]/ M. Bœbius [rest of line complete] (III-V, 575, 14-16) Jaggard 1621 To confirme them in this opinion: [line blank to right margin]/ M. Bœbius [rest of line complete] (III-V, 492, 26-28) We may surmise that Stansby's 1617 compositor (who repeated the punctuation error) blocked out line 15 with quads in order to begin line 16 in agreement with his copy text. Jaggard's compositor (alert enough to correct the punctuation) blocked out his line 27 with quads for no other reason than that he was following the Stansby 1617. erratum Galilœus is superfluous Stansby 1614 Galilœus , Galilœus , a worthy Astrologer now liuing, (I-II, 100, 50) Stansby 1617 GALILÆVS , a worthy Astrologer now liuing, (I-II, 100, 50) Jaggard 1621 A worthy Astrologer now liuing, (I-II, 85, 43) Using the Stansby 1617 along with the Errata page and unaware that the correction had been made, Jaggard's compositor removed GALILÆVS and inadvertently made the "astrologer" anonymous. If he had been using the Stansby 1614 text, he would simply have made the correction. In reprinting the History , Jaggard used the most recent edition available to him, the Stansby 1617. How then could both editions have appeared in the same year? The Pforzheimer Catalogue (III, 846) estimates the time necessary for printing a work this size as "several years." A new edition with a new makeup could not have been composed and printed in less than a year. Thus we have further indication that the Jaggard edition did not first appear in 1617. Since the Jaggard had as its copy-text the Stansby 1617 and since it was impossible that the 1621 was printed from standing type, the conclusion must be drawn that the "Jaggard 1617" is a ghost. A few copies were run off with a misdated colophon (perhaps accounting for its rarity); the error was discovered and corrected. This study indicates that instead of five printings of the History between 1614 and 1621, there were three: the Stansby 1614, 1617, and the Jaggard 1621. The only substantive edition is the 1614; the second and third editions are unrevised reprints of no authority.</field>

This confusion on "issues" led to his argument against suppression. Later when he discovered that suppression did take place, he argued for three and possibly four issues of the 1614 edition, an argument inconsistent with suppression. 7 Sir Walter Ralegh , (1891), p. 281. 8 Here further confusion is present. In actuality the second edition Brushfield refers to is the Stansby 1617, which contains a printed title-page. 9 The undated printed title-page (which contains Ralegh's half-portrait) must not be confused with the engraved allegorical title-page (designed by Reginald Elstracke). This engraved title-page, dated 1614, appears unaltered in the 1614, 1617, 1621, 1628, and 1634 editions. It was redated in the 1652 edition. The dated title-page has led to the miscataloguing of editions from 1617 to 1634 which lack a colophon. 10 II, viii-xxx.

      <field name="heading_text">Some Reprintings of the Gentlemen's Magazine by Jacob Leed</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i It has always been known that monthly numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine were reprinted, but the number, kind, and order of the printings has not been established. William B. Todd plans to provide a description of the original numbers, but it is not within the scope of his plan to describe variants after 1734. The present paper describes two impressions of a 1738 number of GM and demonstrates which is the prior one. The fact that numbers of the magazine were re-impressed from standing type, which is shown here, is of interest to those concerned with the production of the magazine. This paper also discriminates three editions of the January 1742 number, and it indicates a few other reprintings of numbers of the 1742 GM .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii The Supplement to the Gentleman's Magazine is the thirteenth number of a yearly volume, and in the period with which this paper is concerned it regularly consists of three main sections: (1) a titlepage and preface to the volume for the year; (2) reports of parliamentary debates and miscellaneous articles; and (3) indexes for the volume of the magazine. The Supplement to GM for 1738 appears in two impressions. The following points discriminate them. Impression A Titlepage of the volume, line 5 of col. b : Deaths, Heading of p. 665: . . . / For the YEAR 1738. / [single rule] / . . . / ( Continued from page 632.) / . . .

Collation: last gathering is 4 X 2 Pagination: 681 misnumbered 645 RT: upper right serif of T DOES print on pp. 684, 688, 690, 696, 698 "PF": 717 -8 placed closer to the number "384" than to "Chess" CW: 712 Stella Text, p. 672 b , line 31: middle p. 684 b , lines 27-28: Negotiati-/on Copies examined: WM InI OCI [variant: 4 X 2 (— X 2)] A and B are two impressions, not two editions. This is indicated by the straight-edge test, which shows a difference of greater than an en in alignment of letters on only 7 pages. It is further indicated by an examination of individual letters, which shows that even where the alignment of letters in A and B differs, standing type has been used. On p. 672, for example, the straight-edge test shows a difference in alignment of type in the top half of column a , and lines 4 and 5 are divided at different points in the texts of A and B. A: upon / the Prolocutor's B: upon the / Prolocutor's But even where the difference is greatest, it is found that identical sorts were used in both printings. In both A and B there is a nick in the left ascender of U in "Upon" in line 6, in the upper horizontal of P in "Prince" in line 9, and in the lower horizontal of C in "Consort" in line 10. The type was rearranged, but it was not distributed and reset. Similarly, on p. 686 b a close examination shows that standing type was used even though lines 27-28 are divided at different points in A and B. Clear indication of reset type appears on only two pages: p. 684 a-b and p. 688 b show not only variant alignment of letters, variant line-divisions, and variant spellings, but also variant sorts. The titlepage to the volume is reimpressed from the same type as indicated by the same imperfections in the letters: nicks in the right ascender of u in Volume, in the horizontal of L in SYLVANUS , and in the right ascender of a in Cave. In 40 pages of text (I have not checked the 21 pages of index), there are 11 substantive variants, the most important one being on a page that is positively indicated by an inspection of the sorts as a reimpressed, not a reset, page. On p. 700 , lines 10-11, Issue A reads: "Volumes printed in the same / Manner with the Specimen annexed to the Proposals." Issue B reads: "Volumes printed on a neat / Letter of the same Size with the Specimen annexed." Impression A is prior to Impression B. This is proven by the variant on p. 672 b , where A reads "midddle", B "middle". Testing the column with a straight edge shows no difference in alignment of type in A and B. Moreover, all copies of A and B exhibit the use of identical sorts: nicked lower curve of P in "Pontiff" in line 2; nicked curve of P in "Place" in line 18; broken curve of f in "of" in line 25; broken ligature of ct in "erecting (same line as midddle/middle); and broken left serif of w in "now" in line 6 from bottom. As the variant occurs in an otherwise undisturbed column of type, the only plausible explanation for it is that "middle" is a correction of the original "midddle". A feature of particular literary interest in this number of GM is that it contains the "Proposals for Anagrammata Rediviva ." Disguised as proposals for publishing a book by subscription, this is in reality a key to the "Lilliputian" names used in the parliamentary debates that GM was regularly printing in evasion of the law. B. B. Hoover speculates that Samuel Johnson (who began writing for GM in 1738) may be the author of the spurious "Proposals." 2 A short form of the proposals appears on p. 700 in both A and B. The full form appears only in B, pp. 719-720 , leaf 4 X 2. Of 20 copies of A that I have seen, none contains 4 X 2. Of the 3 copies of B that I have seen, 2 contain 4 X 2, and 1 does not. In the only copy that I could examine for conjugacy (WM), 4 X 1 and 4 X 2 are conjugate. In both A and B, 4 X 1 v is indicated as the end of the planned printing unit by the finis " The End of Vol. VIII." In the next year's volume of GM (IX, 699), the proposals are referred to as having been "inserted in the last Supplement."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iii There are at least three editions of the January 1742 number of the Gentleman's Magazine . The most obvious point of discrimination is the ornament at the top of p. 3. In A, a sun; in B, a bowl; in C, a cherub. Edition A Heading of p. 3: / [orn. with sun in center] / THE / Gentleman's Magazine , / For JANUARY 1742. / [row of type orn., square with stem from each side] / Coll.: 8°, π 2 A-D 4 E 2 F-G 4 [$1 (+B2 C2) signed], pp. 1-3 4-30 31 32-48 49 50-55 56 "PF": 5-1 13-2 21-3 29-4 37-5 41-6 49-7 RT: the upper right serif of the first letter, T , does not print on pp. 14, 38, 46, 50, 54 Copies examined: IEN ICU 2 The following copies also contain the ornament with a sun in the center on p. 3, and conform to IEN and ICU 2 in respect to broken T 's in the RT: MoW TNG MoU IaU OU MnHi I InI OO ODW OMC KyU MiDU InU KU. No further examination of them was made. Edition B Heading of p. 3: / [orn. with bowl of fruit in center] / THE / Gentleman's Magazine , / For JANUARY 1747. / [row of type orn., fleur de lis] / Coll.: 8°, π 2 A-D 4 E 2 F-G 4 [$1 signed], pp. 1-3 4-48 49 50-55 56 "PF": 5-1 13-2 21-3 29-4 37-5 41-6 49-7 RT: Upper right serif of T does not print on pp. 10, 20, 50 Copies examined: OCU ODa Edition C Heading of p. 3: / [orn. with cherub face and wings in center] / THE / Gentleman's Magazine , / For JANUARY, 1742. / [single rule] / Coll.: 8°, π 2 A-D 4 E 2 F-G 4 [$1 (+C2) signed], pp. 1-3 4-48 49 50-56 [52 misnumbered 279 at inner corner] "PF": 13-2 21-3 29-4 37-5 41-6 49-7 RT: Upper right serif of T does not print on pp. 22, 26, 32, 40 Copies examined: WM Mi Of these three editions, A seems to be the earliest. In any case, C is not the original number, for the text on p. 49 b contains a cross-reference to the following (February) number of the magazine: ". . . Lords, to be / heard Feb. 4. (See p. 95, 105.)" The reading of A at this point is ". . . Lords, who / appointed them to be heard Feb. 4." B is the same as A here, except that it has a comma after "heard". The indication of the priority of A to B is that in the common printing practice of the time compositors often increased punctuation, but seldom lightened it. A collation of the text of pp. 3-4 shows the punctuation of B heavier than A in 11 instances, lighter in only one. In 6 instances, B has a comma where A has no punctuation; in 3 instances, a semi-colon where A has a comma; in 1 instance, a colon where A has a semi-colon; in 1 instance, a period where A has a comma. In 1 instance, A has a comma where B has no punctuation. C is lighter in punctuation than B on these pages, but heavier than A. If A is the original, B and C seem to be printed independently from it, rather than one from the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iv A cursory examination was made of other numbers of GM for 1738 and 1742. The running titles of various copies were checked against the IEN copy to determine whether the upper right serif of the T was lacking on the same pages as in the IEN copy. A check of 19 copies of the 1738 volume showed no significant difference in the T 's for the January-December numbers. The differences in copies of the Supplement led to the discrimination of the two impressions already discussed. A check of 23 copies of the 1742 volume showed no significant difference in the T 's for the April-September or November-December numbers. (This check could not be used on the 1742 Supplement, for the T was not broken in any of the RTs.) Besides the three editions of the January number, which have already been discussed, the examination also indicated reprintings of the following other numbers of GM , but no detailed investigation of them was made. The 23 copies of the 1742 numbers of GM that were compared to the IEN copy are the following: TNG MoU IaU Mi MoSW OCU OO OMC OCl OU WM MnHi I InI Da MoS KyU MiDU In InU KU OWC KyBgW. The Gentleman's Magazine for February 1742 20 of the copies examined conform to IEN; 3 do not. The upper right serif of the T in the RT does not print on the following pages: IEN: 76 86 90 92 94 96 100 108 OCl: 76 84 88 94 96 100 108 OCU, ODa: 72 94 The OCl copy is not an original number, for on p. 89 there is a cross-reference to the following (March) number of the magazine: " See Scheme V. p. 147, with Observations upon it p. 149." OCU and ODa differ from IEN and OCl in the ornament across the top of the first page of text, p. 59. OCU and ODa have an ornament with a lion and unicorn in the center; IEN and OCl have an ornament with a sun in the center. The Gentleman's Magazine for March 1742 20 copies conform to IEN; 3 do not. The upper right serif of the T in the RT does not print on the following pages: IEN: 128 138 152 154 156 164 Mi, WM: 122 128 138 144 152 154 160 164 ODa: 122 128 138 148 152 154 160 164 The Gentleman's Magazine for October 1742 22 copies conform to IEN; 1 does not.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 As these figures appear where press-figures (PF's) are usually found, I avail myself of the convention for referring to them. However, in GM they do not record presswork; instead they are used as signatures usually are—to guide the binder. W. B. Todd has informed me that this use is regular for GM and, so far as he is aware, is peculiar to GM . The figures are used in the examined copies of the 1738 volume with absolute regularity on the first page of every gathering that does not begin with a titlepage, always in the sequence 1 through 7 in each monthly number, plus an 8 in the supplement. Signatures continue to be used, but erratically. In the IEN copy, for example, gatherings H I Q T 2D 2M 2R 2Y 3C 3I 3N and 3Q are unsigned; signatures N 3H and 4F are duplicated; 3B is missigned "bb"; and 2S has been squeezed out of the sequence 2Q 2 R 2T. 2 Samuel Johnson's Parliamentary Reporting (1953), p. 182. Not having discovered 4X2 until shortly after the book appeared, Hoover printed the abbreviated version that appears on p. 700 of the Supplement. He plans to include the text of 4X2 in his edition of the Debates for the Yale Johnson . Johnson is also thought to have written the introduction to the "Debates" for the June 1738 GM . A bibliographical point of interest about that piece is that its pagination is a duplicated series. The page numbers for the introduction and the first of the debates are enclosed in brackets—pp. [285]-[292]. They are thus distinguished from pp. 285-292 which immediately follow. From this it can be inferred that this material was put together at the last minute and rushed into print after a different format for the June number had already gone to press.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Predecessors to Burke's and Dodsley's Annual Register by John C. Weston, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the recent bicentennial volume of the Annual Register , after quoting from the Preface of the first volume for the year 1758 Edmund Burke's 1 intention of presenting the history of the year in "one connected narrative," the editors state that "this ordered presentation of facts has remained the aim of editorial policy down the years. . . . In broad essentials the volumes of today closely follow the original design." 2 It is a testimony to the breadth of the interest and application of Burke, whose endeavors were largely political, that one important bequest to later generations was to journalism, the form of The Annual Register . But very little has ever been said about the history and origin of this form. 3 In this account of the English annual periodicals before Burke's, I shall discuss only those which are most closely analogous to his, that is, the yearly serial publications appearing the year after the one covered and intending to preserve, organize, and sometimes comment on the historical events of the preceding year. Thus I shall exclude two kinds of annual serials published before or at the beginning of the year for which the volume is designed: (1) handbooks of convenient current information in the form of lists, like The Court and City Register (1746-1797), and (2) almanacs containing astronomical, astrological, and meteorological information, like John Partridge's Merlinus Liberatus (1690-1709). Also I shall exclude, somewhat arbitrarily, serial compendia of historical information which were not published annually, although several are otherwise similar to Burke's. Examples of these periodicals are monthlies, such as, to mention only the one with the longest run, The Present State of Europe (1690-1738); 4 an evidently unique quarterly, The Historical Register (1716-1739), published by the Sun Insurance Office for the first five years; 5 and another evidently unique serial type, the historical biennial, A Help to History in three issues covering 1709 through 1714 (1711, [1713, 1715]). 6 The first English historical annual was A Compleat History of Europe (for the years 1701-1714). 7 David Jones, its editor, hinted at earlier examples of the type in his Preface to the volume for the first year: "To attempt an Annual History . . . may be as Useful and acceptable, as it seems to be Novel, and almost without Precedent" (my italics). But I have been unable to find such a precedent either in England or elsewhere. Jones in the preface for Volume V explained the purpose of the journalist of annual histories, at least in his more idealistic and public moods: Tho' it should be allowed, that some Things should necessarily lie dormant as to us, and be reserv'd to the Discovery of future Generations, yet surely there are many others that must be unavoidably lost, if protracted to such an uncertain Period, where not only a true Idea of Things, and many Notions relating to the Humour of the Age, upon emergent Turns and Occasions, will be quite extinct. The contents of the Compleat History were standard from the beginning. The staple was the long historical narrative with supporting public documents inserted at the appropriate places. Two other smaller sections completed the offering: (1) a chronology of events called "Remarkables" which included those occurrences which could not be worked into the narrative, with particular emphasis on the "Deaths, Characters, and Works of the Learned"; and (2) a section of handy reference information in the form of lists of public people with their titles and offices. An index of names stands at the end of each volume. After Jones's original annual was only one year old and after the accession of a new monarch, the citizen could find in the coffee houses a successful competitor, The History of the Reign of Queen Anne , edited by Abel Boyer, who was most known about this time for compiling a French-English dictionary and somewhat later for editing the well-known historical monthly The Political State of Great Britain (1711-1729). The History of Anne in eleven successive yearly volumes covered the years 1702-1712, that is, all but two of Anne's reign (published 1703-1713). 8 Boyer's most important feature, like his competitor's, was a long historical narrative of domestic and foreign events called "Annals," but he offered a change by putting the public documents in a separate section called "Appendix." These were good solid sections, the Annals and Appendix for Volume V extending to 498 and 201 pages, respectively. Although Boyer did not at first imitate Jones's practice of including special sections for a chronicle and for lists, he later introduced a list of Members of Parliament and later still included handy information in charts and lists among his documents in the Appendix. And for the last three volumes of his series he copied Jones's practice of including a chronicle in a separate section, like Jones calling it "Remarkables." Two years after the demise of this annual, during one of which Jones's Compleat History appeared without rival, Boyer used the occasion of a new reign to begin another called The Annals of King George . The first issue of this new historical annual covered the first full year of George's reign, 1715, and continued yearly for five more issues (the years 1715-1720, published 1716-1721). 9 Unaccountably, Boyer did not use the arrangement established by his eleven years of experimentation on his previous annual, but began his experiments all over again and never did settle down to a standard form. The question again was the handling of his four subject matters: the historical narrative of public events, the documentation, the chronicle of less important occurrences, and the compendium of handy information. He began by jumbling it all together in a long disconnected narrative without heads or glosses but with an index. In the second volume he culled the documentary public papers into an "Appendix." In the fourth volume he introduced mechanical heads to divide his narrative into "Civil Affairs," "Ecclesiastical Affairs," and "Independent Occurrences," the latter containing some handbook-type of information. Then in the fifth volume he substituted lists for the Appendix of documentation: "Advancements, Removes, and New Commissions." And finally in the last volume he reinstalled the Appendix. We will see that Burke profited from these early experiments and was decisive and consistent in his organization from the very beginning. For twenty years after the cessation of Annals of George England, from all that I can discover, was without an historical annual, and when one appeared it survived for only a brief time. The Annals of Europe in six volumes covered the five years of 1739 through 1744 (published 1740-1745). 10 George Gordon, its editor, did not, like his predecessors, present a separate chronicle of non-public events. Instead he concentrated on a yearly narrative of all the events he deemed worth preserving and a single other smaller section devoted to abstracts of public documents and political pamphlets. The length of the historical account is impressive: 570 pages for the year 1741 (as compared to 40 pages for abstracts in the same issue). Another difference is that the long historical part is broken by an elaborate system of mechanical sub-heads, repeated exactly each year, under the two main divisions of domestic and foreign affairs. The section of domestic affairs is usually about four times the size of that of foreign affairs, the subsection devoted to Parliamentary reporting for the year 1741 alone extending to 228 pages. A dozen or so pages of handbook-type information without title or division came at the end of each volume. Like most of these annuals, The Annals of Europe offered an extensive index. Burke's undertaking The Annual Register , fourteen years after the final volume of Annals of Europe , was bold. Robert Dodsley, its publisher, certainly had no assurance that Burke's project in 1758 would work. Although a market had been established for historical annuals in the first quarter of the century, it had pretty much been allowed to lapse or had not been exploited. Dodsley must have been impressed with this young writer to have ventured his money in this scheme. The scheme itself also must have impressed Dodsley, because while taking advantage of the experiments of the earlier annuals, Burke proposed to offer something new for a different age. 11 As he wrote in the Preface to the first issue, "endeavouring to be as extensively useful as possible, we aimed at uniting the plan of the Magazines with that of the Reviews." Burke had in mind the innovation of employing features in an annual that had grown in popularity in the world of periodical literature since the time when the annuals flourished under Anne and George I. The Gentleman's Magazine had been offering monthly collections of miscellaneous prose and poetry since 1731; Burke would offer such things too with the added advantage of a more judicious selectivity allowed by the yearly period. The Monthly Review had been offering monthly accounts of books since 1749; Burke would offer reviews too with again a more compendious and judicious choice provided by a yearly perspective. Burke's main innovation in the history of the annual was to introduce sections on Characters, Natural History, Antiquities, Useful Projects, Miscellaneous Essays, Poetry, and Books. None of his predecessors had such sections because they came before the era of the magazines, although Jones in the Compleat History had included some account of books interspersed in his section called "Remarkables." But the main attraction of the Register from the beginning was the historical part, which Burke placed first in each volume, on which he lavished most attention, and which survived the longest in the history of the periodical. Although Burke did not mention any earlier annuals in his first Preface and could have derived hints from the monthly magazines on how to handle historical material, I think he or Dodsley probably did know of Jones's and Boyer's efforts thirty or so years before. For whereas the latter never did quite know how to handle satisfactorily the three matters of narrative, chronicle, and document, Burke evidently learned from their experiments. Burke from the outset began with a connected and unified narrative of the important and public events of the year, followed with a "Chronicle" containing a day-by-day account of private and sometimes curious occurrences, and concluded the historical part with a section elegantly called "State Papers" containing public documents "to illustrate and confirm the facts advanced" in the narrative. 12 This was Burke's main improvement on the traditional subject of his predecessors. And this invariable and severe relegation to the Chronicle of matters unrelated to the main flow of public events during the year allowed Burke to unify his narrative. He could thus also divide it into natural and organic divisions, which he called chapters, and eschew the older amorphous or mechanically-divided narrative of his predecessors in annual historical writing. Further, the historical narrative could be more succinct by consistent documentation in a separate section for primary sources. It is tempting to conclude that The Annual Register survived while its models, as admirable as they were, had relatively short runs because it bore the stamp of a superior mind which could produce unified and connected history and which as a consequence made improvements in the conventional arrangement to allow for it.</field>

But Professor Richmond Bond has an excellent but very brief survey of the history of the English annual periodical in his introductory essay to Studies in the Early English Periodical (1957), pp. 26-27. I am much indebted to my former teacher Professor Bond for counsel in the preparation of this paper. 4 For a summary account of early historical monthlies, see Bond, pp. 25-26. 5 Probably edited by an Edward Bysshe, according to P. G. M. Dickson, The Sun Insurance Office, 1710-1960 (1960), p. 38. 6 This periodical, by Peter Heylin, contains the same matter as the historical annual, as the subtitle to the first volume shows; "A Short Memorial of the most Material Matters of Facts and Passages, Domestic and Foreign, Which may be useful either in Conversation at present, or History for the future. With an Account of the Births, Deaths, Rise, Fall, &amp;c of Persons of Distinction at Home and Abroad." It presents, in weekly divisions, a chronicle of events mixed with important documents and vital statistics. 7 This periodical, brought to my attention by Professor Bond, has not hitherto been noticed by cataloguers, probably because the curious history of its publication obscures its annual frequency. It first appeared as a history book in the form of annals for the later years of the 17th century; this volume went through two more editions, each of which added two more years of history; then appeared in consecutive years the annual volumes each covering the history of the previous year; in the meantime, four volumes were published containing the history of the previous century. A reconstruction of this publication based on inspection of its prefaces, title pages, and advertisements had best be given in a chronological list of events: 1. 1698, 1st ed. of CH for 1676 through 1696. 2. [1699], 2nd ed. of CH for 1676 through 1698, i.e., with the addition of 2 years. 3. 1701, 3rd ed. of CH for 1676 through 1700, i.e., with the addition of 2 more years; this edition becomes Vol. V of the series; "Printed for John Nicholson, at the King's Arms; J. Harris, at the Harrow, in Little-Britain; and Andrew Bell, at the Cross-Keys, in Cornhill." 4. 1702, CH for 1701 (becomes Vol. VI of the series), "To be Continued Annually," which promise was fulfilled through Vol. XVII for the year 1712 (1713). 5. 1705, CH for 1600-1642 in 2 volumes, i.e., Vols. I and II of the series; "Printed by T. Mead, for H. Rhodes, near Bride-Lane, Fleet-Street; John Nicholson, in Little-Britain; and Andr. Bell, at Cross-Keys, in Cornhill." 6. [1706], CH for 1643-1676 in 2 volumes, i.e., Vols. III and IV of the series. 7. 1720, CH for 1713 and the portion of 1714 to the death of Anne, Vol. XVIII of the series. The first bona fide annual periodical is Vol. VI of the series. The bibliographers evidently looked only at the first five volumes, which are parts of an history published at various times, not volumes of a periodical. 8 The first year published by Francis Coggan in the Inner-Temple Lane and A. Roper at the Blackboy over against St. Dunstan's Church; II by Coggan; III by Roper; IV by Coggan; V by Roper; VI-VII by Margaret Coggan; VIII-IX by T. Ward in the Inner Temple Lane; X: "Printed by D. L. and Sold by J. Lawrence, J. Knapton, J. Wyat, R. Smith, D. Midwinter, R. Robinson, J. Tonson, B. Lintott, J. Round, W. Taylor, T. Ward, N. Cleff, and J. Osborne"; XI: list of booksellers remains the same as in preceding vol. except that Tonson and Ward are out and J. Baker is in. 9 Vols. I-II: "Printed for A. Bell, at the Cross-Keys and Bible in Cornhill; W. Taylor, at the Ship, and J. Baker, at the Black-Boy in Pater-Noster Row"; III: Baker out and T. Vernon and J. Osborn at the Oxford Arms in Lombard Street in ; IV: Vernon out ; V: same; VI: Taylor out . 10 The history of the first year (1739) appeared in two separate volumes (1740 and 1741). The subsequent publication dates were irregular: the vol. of 1740 in 1742, of 1741 in 1743, of 1742 and of 1743 in 1745. George Hawkins at Milton's Head on Fleet Street published the 4 volumes covering the first 3 years and was joined by T. Astley in the last 2 volumes. 11 There is really no way of determining how much either publisher or author was responsible for the plan. It probably emerged from discussions to which they both contributed. The statement in Burke's contract with Dodsley that the new periodical "be printed in octavo in the manner of Millers Kalender [sic]" (Copeland, p. 96) probably refers to the format of Philip Miller's The Gardener's Kalendar (1732, with many subsequent editions), which, however, is a smaller, more elegant and leisurely book than The Annual Register . 12 Burke's only faltering was with the matter of the lists and charts. He first put them unlabeled after the "Chronicle," then called them "Appendix to the Chronicle." The use of the heading "Appendix" suggests perhaps that Burke knew Boyer's annuals.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Yeats's Vision and "The Two Trees" by Robert Mortenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much has been written about Yeats's practice of revising his early poetry. Whether we consider this revision a pernicious practice or only the province of the mature poet-craftsman, the fact remains that many of Yeats's early poems have been revised. All this has been faithfully recorded in the valuable Allt-Alspach Variorum Edition of the Poems of W. B. Yeats . Much also has been written about A Vision : some deny that this esoteric system has any value, while others find it the key to all Yeats's later work. A study of the early poems, before The Wild Swans at Coole , to discover what influence, if any, the Vision system had on the revision of these poems 1 reveals that only "The Two Trees" ( Var. , p. 134 or C. P. , p. 47), first published in 1892, contains a revision clearly influenced by A Vision . Before 1929 the poem read There, through bewildered branches, go Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife, Tossing and tossing to and fro The flaming circle of our life. (ll. 13-16) In 1929 this passage was changed to There the Loves — a circle — go, The flaming circle of our days, Gyring, spiring to and fro In those great ignorant leafy ways; (dashes in l. 13 omitted in 1933) It is not surprising that Yeats wished to change the original lifeless lines to a more startling, precise image in a poem which was Maud Gonne's favorite and which he especially valued on that account. Lines 13 and 14 of the earlier version seem cluttered with adjectives — bewildered, winged, gentle — besides containing a defective image, perhaps even a pathetic fallacy. The later version is clean and concise; "great ignorant leafy ways" seems a more exacting and more highly connotative phrase than "bewildered branches." The former "flaming circle of our life" (with the change of the last word to "days" for purposes of rhyme) becomes identified, in the revised passage, with the Vision 's "Great Wheel" and with the system's principal symbol of the double vortex or intersecting gyres. Thus "gyring, spiring" is substituted for the much less effective "tossing and tossing." Even the change in the order of the lines seems to be an improvement. The revision in this instance is a happy one; the sense has not been materially changed, but greater power is achieved in the later version. 2 Peter Allt, in his thorough study of the revision of the earlier poetry, 3 does not comment on this particular poem, nor does he seem to provide for this kind of revision in his useful categorizing of the revisions. Russell K. Alspach in an important article, "Some Textual Problems in Yeats," does discuss the revision of "The Two Trees" (ll. 13-20), designating the later version "a clearer statement of the desirability-of-innocence theme so superbly expressed ten years earlier in 'A Prayer for My Daughter.'" 4 Alspach does not, however, relate the revised lines to A Vision . "The Two Trees," then, is an unusual, even unique, example in the early poetry of a poem revised with A Vision in mind. In addition, the revision helps to reinforce the point that the system is not merely important for interpretation; A Vision provided metaphors or images for Yeats's poetry. His "spirits" had told him they had come to give him "metaphors for poetry," and Yeats himself in a letter to Olivia Shakespeare in 1929 wrote ". . . I believe I shall have a poetical rebirth for as I write about my cones and gyres all kinds of images come before me." 5 In the case of "The Two Trees" the system supplied a revision providing a new and superior image for a favorite poem, an image that most of us would prefer to the original.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Wild Swans at Coole (1919) forms a convenient stopping point in this case because several of its poems are included in A Vision itself, while others reveal the influence of the system in their genesis. Even certain poems in Responsibilities clearly anticipate the future Vision study. 2 Two other poems which might possibly belong to the category of Vision changes should be briefly mentioned. Lines 21-22 of "To Ireland in the Coming Times" ( Var. , p. 137 or C.P. , p. 49) were revised in 1925 from Of the dim wisdoms old and deep, That God gives unto man in sleep. to Of things discovered in the deep Where only body's laid asleep. The revision seems to be a clarification based on his experience of communicating with spirits through the mediumship of his sleeping wife. Probably he also wished to remove any reference to God as inconsistent with his later beliefs. The second possibility is "The Man who Dreamed of Fairyland" ( Var. , p. 126 or C.P. , p. 43). In 1929 ll. 21-23 were changed from And how beneath those three times blessed skies A Danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons, And as it falls awakens leafy tunes; to Under the golden or the silver skies; That if a dancer stayed his hungry foot It seemed the sun and moon were in the fruit: In A Vision the dancer is mentioned in conjunction with the 13th sphere and the concept of freedom. The dancer appears in a few Vision poems (e.g., "Michael Robartes and the Dancer"); thus this revision could be considered a Vision image. "The Two Trees," however, is the only poem which was unquestionably influenced by A Vision in its revision. 3 G. D. P.

      <field name="heading_text">Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors by Fredson Bowers *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first problem that faces any editor of a text from the nineteenth century, or earlier, is whether to modernize. For nineteenth-century American books there is only one answer: no gain results from modernizing, and much is lost that is characteristic of the author. One may safely say that nothing in the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, word-division, or paragraphing of nineteenth-century books is likely to cause a presentday reader any difficulty, whereas an attempt at modernization is certain to destroy a number of the values of the original. Every reason exists to preserve these classic texts in as close a form as possible to the authors' intentions, to the extent that the surviving documents for each individual work permit of such reconstruction. Indeed, one may flatly assert that any text that is modernized can never pretend to be scholarly, no matter at what audience it is aimed. The second problem is whether to edit the text critically or to content oneself with a reprint of some single document. Again, an argument cannot really exist in favor of a mere reprint, no matter how neatly such a procedure enables an editor to dodge his basic responsibility. It is probably safe to say that no nineteenth-century text of any length exists that is not in need of some correction, and possibly even of revisory emendation. Once an editor tinkers in any way with his original, he has entered upon the province of critical editing; and he had better go the whole way and be consistent than dip his big toe in the water and then draw back in alarm lest he suddenly find himself out of his depth. The first step in critical editing is the so-called establishment of the text. The first step in this process is the determination of the exact forms of the early documents in which the text is preserved and of the facts about their relationship to one another. That is, the early editions within an author's lifetime, and within a sufficient time after his death to give the opportunity for testamentary documents to be produced, must be collated and the authoritative editions isolated. An authoritative edition is one set directly from manuscript, or a later edition that contains corrections or revisions that proceeded from the author. Authority divides itself between the words as meaningful units (i.e., the substantives) and the accidentals, that is, the forms that the words take in respect to spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and division. In this question the theory of copy-text proposed by Sir Walter Greg rules supreme. Greg distinguished between the authority of the substantives and of the forms, or accidentals, assumed by these substantives. If only the first edition, set from manuscript, has authority, as being the closest in each of these two respects to the author's lost manuscript, then both authorities are combined in one edition. On the other hand, a revised edition may alter the authority of some of the substantives; but the transmission of the author's accidentals through the hands, and mind, of still another compositor destroys the authority of these features of the first edition, set from manuscript. An eclectic text must be constructed which combines the superior authority of most of the words in the revised edition with the superior authority of the forms of words in the first edition. The determination of authority is not always easy in a later edition. For example, in Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter three editions (i.e., three different typesettings) were made during his lifetime. In the second edition, set and printed in 1850 within two months of the first, 226 pages were completely reset, but 96 pages were printed from the standing type of the first edition. In the 226 pages of the resetting occur 62 variants from the first edition, of which three are corrections of first-edition typographical errors and four are typographical errors in the second edition. Twelve different words (i.e., variant substantive readings) appear in these pages, and there are 43 changes in spelling, capitalization, and word-division. Of more import, in the 96 pages of standing type, someone ordered eight variants, of which three are spelling, four are punctuation, and one is division. Here if anywhere the author's intentions would be visible if he had ordered these changes in standing type; but an editor will find no clearcut authority in the changes, and indeed some evidence that at least two of them go contrary to Hawthorne's observed characteristics. Once these variants are rejected as non-authorial, therefore, the conclusion must be drawn that Hawthorne did not supervise the production of the second edition and hence no revisions can be accepted from the reset type-pages, although a few corrections will prove useful. Nor does the third edition, the last in Hawthorne's lifetime, yield any readings other than a continuation of corruption, and some necessary but obvious correction. None of the 37 additional alterations in the words seems to have any chance of being an authorial revision, and most are clearly errors. In these circumstances, the editor is forced back to the first edition as the sole authority. But the question then arises, what is the specific authority of each page of this first edition, for it is possible for copies to vary because of changes made during the course of printing. Mechanical collation on the Hinman Machine of eight copies of The Scarlet Letter discloses four differences in readings, but all of these seem to have resulted from type being loosened during the course of printing so that the progression is from correctness to error. However, unless an editor had established the correct readings where these errors exist, he would wrongly have imputed the errors to the first edition; and it is possible that he might have emended differently from the original reading. For example, because an exclamation point dropped out very early in the printing of page 228, no edition before the Centenary recovered this original authoritative punctuation, for all editors were content to follow the second-edition comma that the later compositor inserted when he came to the blank space in his copy. The collation of multiple copies reveals other possibilities for variation. In The Scarlet Letter , interestingly enough, economy of printing led the printer of the first edition to typeset the last two text pages in duplicate. Fortunately no differences appear in these two settings, but the possibility of variation is always present. For example, the new Preface to the second edition was also set in duplicate, and here one typesetting has a comma that appears to be authoritative, whereas the other omits it. An editor who neglected to collate a number of copies might have reprinted arbitrarily from the wrong typesetting and thus, even though in a small matter, have departed from Hawthorne's intention. Even if the first edition were printed from plates, machine collation is necessary to discover concealed printings within the so-called first edition, for the possibility exists that plates may be altered between impressions. For example, the Ticknor and Field cost books list four printings from plates in 1851 of The House of the Seven Gables , and one printing in 1852. Since no copy of an 1852 printing has turned up, it seems clear that one of the unidentified 1851 printings represents the fifth impression with a title-page date unchanged. No book collector or librarian has the least idea which printing his precious first-edition copy represents, but the Hinman Machine discloses the order by combining the evidence of type batter with the evidence for resetting of damaged plates as well as various mendings. It is pure luck that these extensive plate repairs were carried out without producing any changes in the text to baffle the non-bibliographical editor, and it is clear that Hawthorne (if he saw any errors) ordered no revisions between these printings. But not all changes made in plates from printing to printing are so respectful of the text. For instance, the third edition of The Scarlet Letter was printed from plates in 1850 and these plates remained in use at least as late as 1886. In the course of the various repairs made in this interval, five different words got altered so that the text of the final printings from these plates differs from that of the initial printings in this respect as well as in dozens and dozens of punctuation marks worn off or quite altered by batter. These changes have no authority, but it is clear that Hawthorne himself made some alterations in the plates for one of the later printings of The Marble Faun , revisions of which an editor must take account if he knows about them. When an author's manuscript is preserved, this has paramount authority, of course. Yet the fallacy is still maintained that since the first edition was proofread by the author, it must represent his final intentions and hence should be chosen as copy-text. Practical experience shows the contrary. When one collates the manuscript of The House of the Seven Gables against the first printed edition, one finds an average of ten to fifteen differences per page between the manuscript and the print, many of them consistent alterations from the manuscript system of punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and word-division. It would be ridiculous to argue that Hawthorne made approximately three to four thousand small changes in proof, and then wrote the manuscript of The Blithedale Romance according to the same system as the manuscript of the Seven Gables , a system that he had rejected in proof. A close study of the several thousand variants in Seven Gables demonstrates that almost every one can be attributed to the printer. That Hawthorne passed them in proof is indisputable, but that they differ from what he wrote in the manuscript and manifestly preferred is also indisputable. Thus the editor must choose the manuscript as his major authority, correcting from the first edition only what are positive errors in the accidentals of the manuscript. However, when words differ in the print from the manuscript, as they do a certain number of times, the question of authority arises. Any difference in words can arise only by reason of printer's error that Hawthorne did not catch in proof, or by reason of changes that Hawthorne himself made in the lost proof-sheets. Each variant, thus, becomes an editorial responsibility, to be adjudicated on the evidence available. In The Blithedale Romance Hawthorne can be assigned twenty-four of the verbal proof-changes between manuscript and first edition. The printer is responsible, fairly clearly, for the remaining seven of the thirty-one differences in wording. Here we encounter the theory of a critical edition. Obviously, an editor cannot simply reprint the manuscript, and he must substitute for its readings any words that he believes Hawthorne changed in proof. Once more, if one argues why not reprint the first edition and be done with it — then two questions of evidence are pertinent. First, in reprinting the first edition of The Blithedale Romance , one would be attributing to Hawthorne seven words that are actually printer's errors. Secondly, if an author's habits of expression go beyond words and into the forms that these take, together with the punctuation that helps to shape the relationships of these words, then one is foolish to prefer a printing-house style to the author's style. This distinction is not theory, but fact. Hawthorne's punctuation, for example, is much more meaningful in respect to emphasis and to delicate matters of parenthesis and subordination than is the printing-house style in which Seven Gables and The Blithedale Romance appeared. In each book, the real flavor of Hawthorne, cumulatively developing in several thousand small distinctions, can be found only in the manuscript. Sometimes the Greg formula that authors' substantive revisions in later editions must always be followed, when identified, but that the best authority for the accidentals remains the edition set directly from manuscript, produces some complexity, and the result will agree in a number of details with no preserved document, even though it will represent the nearest approximation in every respect of the author's final intentions. An eclectic editor must be prepared for any eventuality. In The Marble Faun , for example, Hawthorne seems to have proofread the original English edition rather carelessly, because he made a number of corrections, and a few revisions, in the first American edition, which was set up from the English sheets. Fortunately, we have the manuscript preserved (though lost sight of for many years). Hence an editor will base his edition on the manuscript copy-text but will substitute, first, any words from the English first edition that he thinks are authorial proof changes, and then, in addition, any variant readings from the first American edition that appear to him, also, to represent the author's alterations, and then, in addition, the authoritative Hawthorne revisions and corrections made later in the first-edition plates. This is indeed an eclectic text, but the unique results will be closer to Hawthorne's characteristics than any single preserved document, not only in respect to the insertion of Hawthorne's final intentions within the framework of his original accidentals but also in respect to the scholarly refusal to reprint errors from either the first English or the first American edition any more than the rejected readings of the manuscript. Granted that an editor has established a critical text that will stand up under the most searching investigation of scholarship, then what will scholars want from his apparatus? First, a list of the internal variants in the first and in any other authoritative edition as revealed by the collation of a number of copies of each, preferably on the Hinman Machine. Secondly, a complete list of all editorial changes in the selected copy-text. These changes comprise corrections and revisions admitted from later editions as well as the editor's own alterations. For the sake of the record, the editor should list the earliest edition from which he draws any alteration. Textual notes should discuss briefly any arguable emendations, or failure to emend. The next item is the Historical Collation. This should contain all the substantive alterations from the established edited text found in a group of significant later editions. An edition is to be defined as any new typesetting. Obviously, any edition within the author's lifetime may be significant and must be collated. Thereafter the editor's discretion may enter. Usually it is important to select editions that have been influential in the formation of the text, or that have been commonly used by critics. For instance, the decision was made by the Centenary editors of Hawthorne to confine the Historical Collation largely to the Boston collected editions published in the Ticknor and Field line to Houghton Mifflin, as well as any separate editions published within the author's lifetime. For The Scarlet Letter , therefore, the Centenary Edition records the readings from the second edition of 1850, the third edition of 1850, the Little Classics edition of 1875, the Riverside of 1883, and ends with the Autograph of 1900. Included always are the first English editions in case any authoritative changes were made in the copy sent abroad, and usually any modern edition that has been freshly edited in fact instead of in theory. To insure accuracy, the sets of plates are taken as representing the various editions, and the earliest and latest printings from each edition-set of plates have been collated on the Hinman Machine and their variants recorded in the Centenary apparatus. All printings from plates within the author's lifetime have also been collated whenever variants appeared between the first and last impressions of any set of plates instituted before his death. Although this Historical Collation is chiefly a record of the corruption of the text, it serves as a useful object lesson in the untrustworthy nature of various commonly esteemed editions. More important, however, this list insures that all cards are on the table. If any collated edition has authority not recognized by the editor, the critic will find the record of its variants and all the evidence on which, throughout, the editor made up his mind about the details of the text. When a manuscript is preserved, an important separate list will contain a record of all the rejected readings and revisions during the process of inscription. Moreover, the variants in any preserved proof-sheets should be recorded with the same scrupulousness and for the same critical purpose. So far as I know, a problem that no editor has faced concerns the word-division whenever a compound in the copy-text is divided at the end of one line and the start of the next. The exact form of all such compounds must be settled so that the edited text will contain that one that is characteristic of the author. Since editorial judgment is sometimes involved in this process, a list of such divided possible compounds should be provided. Correspondingly, the modern printer will divide a number of compounds so that a reader will not always know the exact form in the original. A second section of the compound list should note the copy-text reading in all such cases. The amount of collating and checking in such an edition as has been outlined is very heavy indeed; but only this editorial process scrupulously carried out will produce editions of American classics that will stand the test of time and, heaven willing, need never be edited again from the ground up. When scholars editing American literature will bring to their task the careful effort that has been established as necessary for English Renaissance texts, say, then the editing of American texts will become a respectable occupation at long last, and not a piece of hack work for the paperbacks.</field>
