      <field name="heading_text">Textual Criticism at the Millennium by G. THOMAS TANSELLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Textual criticism is one of the few scholarly fields that can be talked about in terms of millennia, for it has been practiced in an organized fashion for at least twenty-three hundred years. A millennial year is a natural point for retrospection and stock-taking, and the most recent one, marking the turn to the twenty-first century, came at a moment fundamentally unlike any other in the long history of the field. Although differing approaches to perennial issues might have been in the ascendent at whatever past moments one chooses to look at, all those moments—before the last decade or two of the twentieth century— would have shared a dominant concern for authorial intention as the basis for editing. During the last part of the twentieth century, however, a focus on texts as social products came to characterize the bulk of the discussion of textual theory, if not editions themselves. For the first time, the majority of writings on textual matters expressed a lack of interest in, and often active disapproval of, approaching texts as the products of individual creators; and it promoted instead the forms of texts that emerged from the social process leading to public distribution, forms that were therefore accessible to readers. This dramatic shift has produced some benefits, but it has not been an unmixed blessing. Both the turn away from the author and the emphasis on textual instability reflect trends in literary and cultural criticism and thus are evidence of the growing interconnections between fields that for too long had little influence on each other. Furthermore, the attention that has now been directed toward the nonauthorial contributions to textual constitution (and hence toward the effect of design features on readers' responses) is long overdue. That authors do not generally act alone to bring their works to the public has of course always been understood, as has the fact that publicly available texts—however much they may have departed from their authors' intentions—are the texts that were historically influential. But far less had been written on these matters than on the importance of what authors intended, and it was high time that this imbalance be redressed. These welcome developments, however, came at a price. One is that the prose of many textual critics has been infiltrated with the fashionable buzz-words of literary theory and with a style of writing that often substitutes complexity of expression for careful thought. Another is the notion that recognizing the importance of socially produced texts involves rejecting the study of authorial intentions. Those who, quite correctly , have called attention to the value of studying social texts have unfortunately often undercut their accomplishment by denying the historical significance of the earliest stages in the history of every text and by persisting in the belief that labeling authorial intention "Romantic" and "idealistic" effectively suggests its unworthiness. Still another problem is that the emphasis on documentary texts has led to a considerable amount of unfounded criticism of the activity of critical editing and the "mediation" practiced by scholarly editors. I shall illustrate these points here by examining in some detail many of the theoretical writings on textual criticism and scholarly editing published in the English language during the last five years or so of the twentieth century—writings that form an index to the state of textual criticism at the millennium. 1 There is no shortage of material to look at, for the quantity of books and essays in this field has shown no decline from the high level it reached during the preceding several decades. Books have of course appeared from a variety of publishers, but one publishing effort worth singling out is the University of Michigan Press series "Editorial Theory and Literary Criticism," begun in 1993 under the general editorship of George Bornstein. Now numbering more than a dozen volumes, it includes some of the most important books in the field during this period, such as Joseph Grigely's Textualterity (1995) and Peter L. Shillingsburg's Resisting Texts (1997). 2 Essays on textual criticism also come out regularly both in periodicals and, increasingly, in anthologies. As always, the bibliographical-society journals are a more likely outlet than the journals of literary criticism and theory; and since 1984 the annual volume of the Society for Textual Scholarship, Text, has been a major venue. Although it has usefully tried to be interdisciplinary from the start, its importance increased markedly with the sixth volume (1994), when a book-review section, edited by Peter L. Shillingsburg, was introduced . Shillingsburg generally matches books and reviewers with skill and allows reviewers to write substantial essays; the result is that Text is now the premier English-language book-reviewing medium in the textual field. 3 There were probably, however, more essays published in anthologies than in periodicals. The explosion of anthologies of original essays in this field in the early 1990s did not abate in the later part of the decade, with an average of about five appearing each year, some of them deriving from conferences. 4 The Michigan series alone added six anthologies during this period; 5 the long-running University of Toronto "Conference on Editorial Problems" series was also augmented by six; 6 and the series of Beihefte published by the German journal Editio included one anthology entirely in English. 7 Another series was created by W. Speed Hill's publication in 1998 of a second volume of papers delivered at the Renaissance English Text Society meetings. Two other scholars who had previously edited anthologies on textual matters, Philip Cohen and Paul Eggert, brought out second ones, and D. C. Greetham was responsible for two during this period. 8 A few volumes were focused on specific areas, such as classics, Old and Middle English, Shakespeare, stemmatics, and electronic editions. 9 But most had a vaguer kind of unity, with the contributions being related more or less directly to a broad conceptual title. 10 Several anthologies were published as special numbers of journals , 11 and several others were mini-anthologies that formed designated groupings within numbers of journals. 12 It also happens that during the second half of the 1990s several contributions were made to three basic genres of scholarly publication that support textual scholarship. One introductory textbook was brought out in a revised edition; 13 four cumulated specialized checklists of scholarship were published; 14 and four guides to the transcription of manuscripts appeared. 15 Another feature of this period was the mounting criticism directed at librarians for their willingness to allow microfilms and digitizations to be substituted for originals. This matter is vital to textual scholars, who must have access to original physical evidence no matter what approach to editing they take, since it is necessary for studying both production and reception history. A wide audience became acquainted with the problem when the novelist Nicholson Baker published an article in The New Yorker detailing the British Library's disposal of the last surviving great collection of post-1850 American newspapers ("Deadline ," 24 July 2000, pp. 42-61). 16 (One may note parenthetically that textual criticism itself reached a larger audience than usual in the late 1990s through the staging and publication of Tom Stoppard's The Invention of Love [1998], in which A. E. Housman appears as a character and speaks some of the wittiest passages from his editorial prefaces.) 17 Three of the recurring themes during this period were the application of textual criticism to nonverbal works, the editorial traditions of nonEnglish-speaking countries, and the role of the computer in editing. I shall take up each of these before turning to some of the more general studies of textual issues.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Although the bulk of the writing on textual criticism has historically emerged from the fields of classics, religion, and literature, one characteristic of the last years of the twentieth century was a broader awareness of the textual problems that exist in other areas and a greater interchange of ideas among textual scholars in different disciplines. This trend began considerably earlier, for interest in critical editing of the work of philosophers was reflected in the early development of the Center for Editions of American Authors (with the first volume of the John Dewey edition appearing in 1967), and the founding of the Association for Documentary Editing in 1978 grew out of discussions between editors of literary works and those of the papers of historical figures. More recently, the establishment (in 1993) of the Association for Textual Scholarship in Art History symbolized the growing recognition of the importance of textual work in all fields that use verbal texts. And the Toronto series of anthologies has made this point repeatedly over the years by devoting volumes to the editing of writings on science, economics , exploration, and music. 18 Works from oral traditions are of course partly verbal, but they contain many other elements, such as intonation, gesture, and setting; and the attempt to recapture such works from tangible texts has been an active field in the late twentieth century, owing much to the excellent writings of John Miles Foley, whose subtle and comprehensive vision links the scholarly efforts in diverse traditions. 19 In the textual study of drama, another genre of partly verbal performance works, there has been a similar trend to recognize the value of tangible texts that reflect performance . In a field previously dominated by a literary emphasis and a concern for authorial intention, this shift has been part of the larger movement to understand cultural products as socially constructed; 20 but students of drama have something to learn from the methodology of oral-tradition scholars, who understand that having a performance text on paper is only the beginning of the process of recovering the work, which consists of much more than words. The cinema, which has obvious similarities with the drama, nevertheless offers a very different textual situation, since film records the nonverbal as well as the verbal aspects of the work, which thus do not have to be reconstructed from a script. 21 Partly for this reason, textual criticism of cinematic works has not involved extensive debate (unlike the field of drama) over whether the verbal parts should be treated as literature. Yet literature and cinema do share many textual issues, and one example of a (primarily literary) textual critic who has brought the two together is Hershel Parker, who in 1995 contrasted the interest of film critics in the search for directors' thwarted intentions with the prevailing lack of interest by literary critics in going behind published texts to authorial intentions. 22 Music, though often without verbal elements, is like literature in its use of notation on paper, and there has been a long tradition of editorial work in music. A sign of the growing interchange of ideas between the two fields was the election of Philip Gossett (in charge of the Verdi editorial project) as president of the Society for Textual Scholarship for 1993-95 and the publication of his presidential address in Text. 23 It is interesting to learn, from Rolf E. Du Rietz's autobiographical account of the development (or "discovery," as he sees it) of his definition of "text," that he was first inspired (some fifty years ago) to think about textual matters by his love of music and cinema. Since then, as his many publications attest, his thinking has encompassed all fields, but his definition of "text" is restricted to works that use intangible media: "A text is the sequence in a sequential work." 24 In his view, to apply "text" to nonsequential, or "stationary," works like paintings "makes the text concept next to meaningless or at any rate useless, turning the concept of `textual criticism' into sheer mockery" (pp. 53-54). It is not clear, however, why one should exclude from textual criticism such activities as studying drafts or versions of paintings (including those uncovered by X-ray) and deciding what the restoration of a fresco should involve. One could of course think up a different term for this purpose, but to do so would obscure the essential identity of these pursuits and those of the scholars traditionally called textual critics. Acceptance of this point is illustrated by the presence of James Beck (a critic of the Sistine Chapel restoration) on the board of the Society for Textual Scholarship in the 1990s and indeed by the Society's inclusion of the field within its interdisciplinary mandate. 25 As a way of representing the recent discussion of textual matters in nonverbal works, I shall concentrate here on two books about music and one on visual art. The earlier of the books on music, John Caldwell's Editing Early Music, is devoted almost entirely to practical matters, such as transcription and presentation. Its "second edition" of 1995 differs from the original 1985 text only in the incorporation of some minor corrections , the addition of an eight-page postscript, and the updating of the "Select Bibliography." Although the advice on translating the notation systems of earlier periods into a modern one will be helpful to anyone undertaking such a task, the theoretical issues that underlie modernizing , as well as all other aspects of editing, are given scant attention, largely confined to the first five pages of the opening chapter (and not significantly amplified in the postscript). In these pages, Caldwell offers some sound advice, recognizing, for example, the dangers of microfilm and the necessity for examining multiple copies of printed editions (p. 3); and he understands, as many editors do not, that the presence of an editorial emendation in one of the source documents "will not automatically validate it, nor will its absence elsewhere automatically invalidate it" (p. 5). Despite these encouraging glimmers, his discussion as a whole has not been carefully thought out. Even on the relatively untheoretical matter of modernizing notation, for instance, the basis for his position is not clear. He insists on modernized notation ("There is no place for `scholarly' editions which use barely legible forms of notation" [p. 1]), 26 and yet he believes that the "requirements of performers and scholars are—or should be—identical" (p. v). He focuses on what he calls a " scholarly performing edition" (p. 2)—"performable as it stands" (p. 1)—but admits a "bias" toward "forms of notation closer to the original than is sometimes favoured" (p. 12); he presumably approves the "increasing tendency to revert to original forms of notation," an approach justified, he believes, by "the increasing literacy of performers" (p. 44). He never gets to the heart of the matter. Nor does he—on the more central question of the evaluation of variants—see the fallacy of the "best-text" approach . When there is "insufficient evidence" to reconstruct an archetype from stemmatic relationships, a preferable way is "to select a single source and to emend it where necessary" (p. 4); this is "the most objective method of presentation" (p. 5), avoiding "a haphazard conflation based on pragmatic or subjective criteria" (p. 4). Of course, no one would defend a "haphazard" approach; what is missing here is a recognition of the role of informed judgment in reducing the haphazardness of individual documentary texts. The other book, James Grier's The Critical Editing of Music (1996), is a more thoughtful work and is admirable in many respects. Among its primary virtues is its recognition that a comprehensive introductory guide requires thorough discussion of textual theory and the rationale of editing and needs to be more than a compendium of suggestions about the presentation of texts and textual evidence (though generally sensible discussions of these matters are included). Grier understands that everything depends on the quality of thought that goes into the definition of a textual goal and the assessment of evidence. And he is to be applauded for his emphasis on the centrality of interpretation and judgment to the editorial enterprise. When one considers how many people in all fields (by no means music alone) still think of editing as essentially a mechanical task, one can hardly complain about Grier's insistent repetitions of the point that it is a critical activity. He begins (p. xiii) and ends (p. 183) the book with the statement that editing is "an act of criticism," and the reader is never allowed to forget it. 27 Nor can a reader avoid confronting the fact that editing is a form of historical study and that a prerequisite for it is immersion in the historical context of the work to be edited. Furthermore, Grier brings to his discussion a thorough knowledge of the history of music editing (and of writing about it), and he has clearly read widely in the textual criticism of verbal works. With so much that is praiseworthy about Grier's general approach, it is regrettable that his book contains some lapses that will exasperate careful readers. Perhaps the key one is the way in which he rejects a focus on authorial intention in favor of Jerome McGann's social approach, which is, he says, "the one theory that I believe holds promise for editing either literature or music" (p. 108). His argument simply repeats what are by now standard points, without examining them critically enough to expose their fallaciousness. He says, for example, that by "rejecting the concept of final authorial intention, and replacing it with his theory of the social nature of the work of art, McGann transforms the process of editing from a psychological endeavour . . . into a historical undertaking " (p. 17). The trouble with this kind of statement is that it tries to make pairings out of overlapping concepts. In the first pair ("authorial intention"/"social nature"), intention is common to both elements, since a socially constructed text can contain unintended errors just as easily as can a text constructed by one person. Unless one wishes to refrain from all emendation of documentary texts, one is admitting the concept of intention. The real distinction here has nothing to do with intention: it is simply whether the focus is on the product of a single author or on a collaboratively constructed product. The second pair ("psychological endeavour"/"historical undertaking") displays the same problem: is human thinking not a part of history? The attempt to recover what one person thought in the past is no different from the effort to know what a group of people thought. Mental states are historical facts, which may be more, or less, recoverable in different situations. Lurking behind Grier's sentence is the unsupportable idea that a text surviving on paper is more "historical" than one that must be reconstructed . But the concept of critical editing in the first place arises from the recognition that surviving physical evidence is random and potentially misleading and that historical knowledge requires extrapolation from it. That intentions (of authors or diplomats, or anyone else) are never fully knowable does not distinguish them from the other historical facts that we wish to pursue. It is strange that Grier does not make this point himself, since he certainly understands the indeterminacy of historical reconstruction and makes some excellent comments on it. Near the end, for instance, he says that sometimes "the truth is simply not ascertainable" but that nevertheless a hypothetical reconstruction by a person who can draw on "intensive and extensive study of the work and its historical context" is valuable (p. 182). If, instead, he had seen that his own thinking does not support the rejection of intention, he would also have understood that an interest in the social construction of art is not incompatible with an interest in the initial creators of artworks, for the latter simply represent the earliest of the successive individuals involved in the evolution of a work. Grier's concern for accommodating changing performance practices leads him to say, rightly, that "for many works, each source is a viable record of one form of the work" (p. 109). The authorially intended text or texts are other such forms, and the job of reconstructing them is not different in kind from the task (recognized by Grier in the same passage) of locating errors in the surviving texts of socially produced forms. The fact that music is a performing art understandably causes Grier to be interested in textual variations that result from the conventions of performance at different times, just as students of drama properly have the same concern. But he is on shaky ground when he tries to place a firm line between music and nondramatic verbal works. He argues that, in contrast to literature, "the written text of a [musical] work, its score, is not self-sufficient" and "that text and work, therefore, are not synonymous " (p. 21). What he means by "text and work" is of course "text of a document and text of a work"; but even with that clarification, one cannot agree that the two are synonymous in literature. Since both literature and music use intangible media, tangible texts in both cases are sets of instructions for the recreation of works. Readers of verbal works are necessarily performers, and clues to some of their performances are preserved in the form of new editions or critical commentary. The fact that listeners to music may be further removed from a written text does not alter the fundamental situation, even if it does complicate the act of recreating the works, by making it a combination of the responses of the so-called performer and the so-called listener. Actually the listener is also a performer; and the performance traditions reflected in musical scores are not merely the product of "performers" but of performers-aslisteners and of audience members whose performances are communicated in essays and conversation. (An edition, which sets forth a text, and an essay, which—by responding to a text—implies a somewhat different one, are not so distinct as is often thought.) It does not serve Grier's purpose well to attempt to separate music from literature: a fuller elaboration of their essential similarity could have led to a subtler detailing of what differences there are. 28 Another example of confused thinking is Grier's repeated assertion that readings can be assigned to one of three categories: "good readings, reasonable competing readings, and clear errors" (e.g., p. 30; cf. p. 98). The third is appropriately defined as readings that are "deemed impossible within the stylistic boundaries of the piece" (p. 31)—a definition that makes clear (as do the variations on it throughout the book) the dependence of the concept on the judgment of individual editors. But the other two are at best inappropriately named and at worst misconceived . The choice of the two words "good" and "reasonable" suggests that a distinction is being made, and "good" would seem to convey a higher level of certainty than "reasonable." But a plausible reading that does not have a plausible (or "reasonable") competing variant in the extant documents is not necessarily a more certain reading than one that does have, as Housman never tired of pointing out. Indeed, two plausible competing variants could both be right (for example, each could have been the author's at a different time), and the plausible uncontested reading could be unauthentic (and could perhaps be corrected or improved through shrewd emendation). In what sense, then, is it "good"? The construction of stemmata based on shared errors may indeed sometimes help to decide between competing plausible readings (the " express purpose" for which the stemmatic method exists, he asserts on p. 36); and the division of plausible readings into two categories, according to whether or not they are contested within the documents, has some relevance for this limited purpose. But to maintain the distinction in broader contexts, not explicitly focused on stemmatic analysis, is in effect to downgrade the role of editorial emendation; for when one takes into account any plausible readings thought of by the editor (that is, nondocumentary readings), some of the "good" readings may be just as seriously contested as any in the other category. To call them "good" is not only illogical in itself but also potentially inhibiting to further thought. However, despite the various problems I have mentioned, and others like them, 29 there is enough sound advice in Grier's book to make it capable of having a beneficial influence on music editing. When we turn to visual art, we encounter Joseph Grigely's remarkable book Textualterity: Art, Theory, and Textual Criticism (1995), and we are on a very different level. This book does not simply try to apply literary textual criticism to visual art but rather builds on what has been said in the literary field in order to take textual criticism a step forward, and thus to make a contribution to thinking about all cultural productions , not just visual art and literature. Two chapters had been previously published, and readers of those essays would have been prepared for the intelligence and clarity of the book, which affords the rare pleasure of sustained argument that constantly illuminates its subject—partly through its wonderful array of examples and partly through its sensitivity to language. 30 One might think that any book with a title like Textualterity could not reflect much linguistic taste, and I must admit that the title is one of Grigely's mistakes, for it suggests a flashiness and trendiness that I do not find in the work itself. To be sure, some fashionable jargon does occur in the book, but generally it is employed in a matter-of-fact way, as a precise means of saying something: he uses it when he needs it. One never feels that he is trying to show off or link himself with certain other critics. In short, he knows how to write. 31 His coinage textualterity does not mean what one might have expected it to mean. One might think that it refers to the otherness of texts, to the fact that texts are not (at least literally) living organisms. But it actually means almost the opposite, referring to the ways in which texts participate in life, changing over time both in themselves and in the roles they are made to play. The opening sentence of the introduction is a straightforward announcement of the subject: "This book is about the transmission of cultural texts, and about how individual works of art undergo change as part of the process of being disseminated in culture." Textualterity encompasses "textual transformations and textual difference." His "underlying premise" is that "the uniqueness of the unique art object or literary text is constantly undergoing continuous and discontinuous transience as it ages, is altered by editors and conservators , and is resituated or reterritorialized in different publications and exhibition spaces." It is inevitable that an investigation of the textual criticism of visual art should focus on changing appearances: the work, being physical, changes as it ages whether human beings do anything to it or not, and when they do intervene in the text their action is irreversible . Those dealing with literature do not face quite the same conditions , since in most cases the aging of a book does not alter the verbal text within it and since an editor who alters a verbal text by producing a new edition does not thereby prevent anyone from experiencing the previous text. If this essential difference between literature and visual art dictates the direction of the book, Grigely makes clear that he does not regard it in any sense as a burden or a liability. Of course we have to accept impermanence in visual art whether we like it or not, but Grigely shows why we should relish and celebrate it, and he turns this attitude back on literature. To Grigely, works of verbal and visual art are alike in being affected by their physical contexts (a particular book design or exhibition gallery) and in being disseminated in variant texts (editions or artbooks and postcards). That he regards a postcard of a painting, for example, as one of the texts of that painting shows the extent to which he bypasses traditional ontological conceptions of art in order to illuminate texts as they make their way in society—to show "how the meanings we create for a work of art or literature are (to a large extent) a product of the textual spaces we enter and engage in" (p. 3). An especially admirable aspect of his conception is its inclusiveness: he is interested both in the "very particular text" that someone is encountering (or has encountered) and in "the conditions under which this text has transpired to acquire the form" it now displays (or once displayed). What is important to him is "not the historical context of the work alone, or the social context of the critic alone, but the way these contexts overlap with the contexts of textual reproduction" (p. 4). Although it is not strictly accurate to call the histories of authorship and readership "synchronic," one understands that he is contrasting their relatively limited purviews with the diachronic "histories of textual transformation." Textual criticism, he recognizes, is a form of historical study, uncovering relationships among texts; and he wishes to emphasize that the examination of multiple texts "takes us closer not just to the process of composition, or the work's meanings, but closer to the vicissitudes of cultural activity" that brought these texts about (p. 7). Contemplating all these interactions gives one "textual consciousness"—which amounts to bringing everything one can learn about the history of a work into the context for experiencing the work in the present. Grigely claims no novelty for this approach, asserting that the "one enduring goal of textual criticism" has traditionally been "to make textual consciousness . . . a part of all critical activity" (p. 8). His contribution is to extend this approach to works of visual art, and by implication to works in all media, and his brief (ten-page) introduction is a masterly and eloquent expression of this vision. Anyone who reads through Grigely's introduction will be in a position to make two observations. One is that Grigely's focus is on textual criticism rather than editing, on understanding textual situations rather than on taking particular actions based on that understanding. Second, authorial intention has no favored status in his thinking since it is not more important than many other factors in the production of culturally influential textual transformations. That Grigely does not explicitly make these two points is a strength of his essay: he is not, in other words, against something but is expressing the reasons for taking a particular approach. One of the few false steps in these early pages is his statement that art "does not depend on maintaining a certain intention or condition " (p. 1). Readers familiar with recent textual debates will hear this as a response to an adversary behind the scenes—though the advocates of authorial intention would not in fact claim that works "depend" on intention, since we are all surrounded by instances of the power of unintended forms. This use of "depend" is a minor—a very minor—flaw, and it is worth calling attention to only because it helps to make clear how remarkably unpartisan Grigely's attitude is. He has his eye on something higher than critical infighting. All of this book exemplifies this point except for one chapter—the first, immediately following his admirable introduction. He had the notion—not unreasonably but not necessarily correctly—that he should offer some account of traditional, literature-based textual criticism as the "groundwork" for his discussion of visual art in the later chapters. Having set himself this task, it is not surprising that he would do it in an original way; what is surprising is that his treatment, fascinating though it is, serves his purpose so poorly. The chapter, entitled "Textual Eugenics," first provides a succinct, and intensely interesting, history of the Anglo-American eugenics movement and then examines twentiethcentury textual criticism and editing in terms of "parallels between eugenic ideology and editorial practices" (p. 11). Even when his argument involves a comparison between Hitler and Fredson Bowers, it is not objectionable in the way one might think. There are, however, two objections that I would lodge against it. First, the analogy between eugenics and the kind of editing that aims to purify texts (in the name of authorial intention) is insufficiently exact to be carried out productively to the length it is here. Grigely recognizes that texts are not people (pp. 30-31), but he maintains that the relation between people and the actions they take toward texts (the products of other people) validates his analogy. Nevertheless, it is hard to get around the fact that eugenicists would like to eradicate the impure, whereas literary editors who wish to construct pure texts do not try to destroy the impure texts that formed the basis of their historical research, or indeed to prohibit anyone from reading them. The analogy that Grigely attempts to elaborate is not ultimately illuminating; and if its purpose is to promote disdain for intentionalist editing, it is unworthy of Grigely. My other objection to the eugenics analogy is that, as executed here, it encourages a blurring of the important distinction between textual criticism and editing. Grigely fully understands the distinction. And yet he makes statements like this: "Textual criticism is not, as some would have it, about utopias; it is about real texts in a real world" (p. 32). There have of course been many scholars who engaged in textual criticism in order to use the results as the basis for eliminating nonauthorial readings from texts, but they recognized that this editorial activity was not the only action that could be based on the prior research—that their investigation of "real texts" did not dictate the kind of editing they chose to engage in. (The fact that textual criticism involves criticism—judgment—does not distinguish it from all other forms of historical research.) Near the end of the chapter, Grigely says that "Textual criticism and bibliography could therefore be redefined as disciplines that study manifestations of difference in cultural texts, wherein `difference' does not presuppose a genre or a system of values." And two sentences later, he urges the abandonment of the "either/or paradigms upon which critical editing has based itself" (p. 48). But textual criticism and bibliography are already conceived of as history, and therefore as the study of the eternal panorama of difference; the either/or paradigms, when they exist, come from editors, not from the textual criticism that underlies their work. Critical editors do sometimes follow an either/or approach in making emendations, but the best of them never believe that the texts they construct are the only responsible ones. It is hard to understand why Grigely should want to suggest that textual criticism (which, after all, offers essentially the outlook he advocates) is somehow causally linked with a style of editing he deems undesirable. Indeed, it is a puzzle that he should regard intentionalist editing as undersirable in the first place. His general attitude, as expressed elsewhere in the book, is an openness to whatever happens to texts, recognizing that all textual transformations reflect a particular set of cultural forces operating at a given moment. Yet here he complains about " textual critics" (i.e., critical editors), who—he says—have "historically stigmatized this inevitable transience" (p. 28) instead of understanding that the "plurality of readings" is a "normative condition" (p. 29). He seems willfully to ignore the fact that a desire for fixity is also a normative condition and that the intentionalist urge is just as natural as the various other motivations for textual alteration. Why does he not regard intentionalist editing by professional scholars as an inevitable, and understandable , cultural manifestation, and thus as a phenomenon that can be productively studied? He complains that the "elisions concomitant with eclectic editing, while making hypothetical texts real, also make real texts hypothetical by effacing their presence and, by default, their historical drift" (p. 30). This statement is of course not literally true, but the more important point to be made about it is that intentionalist eclecticism is itself a manifestation of the historical drift of texts. (How could it fail to be? It is not outside of history.) Grigely, quite properly, does not deplore the Reader's Digest condensed version of Tom Sawyer, for example, but rather examines it for its cultural implications (pp. 39-46). To criticize intentionalist scholarly activity as " institutionally sanctioned forgetting" (p. 30) simply does not fit with the point of view of the rest of the book. Every textual transformation effaces the past in its own way and is sanctioned by one institution or another. Although Grigely's chapter on textual eugenics contains many valuable points, its tone and orientation inject a jarring note into the book. Given the way the chapter is written, readers would do better to skip over it and move from the introduction to the chapter entitled " Textualterity ," and on to the end of the book. If they do so, they will find a wise and penetrating account of how textual consciousness enriches cultural experience. His focus on visual art, with its physical basis, leads him to emphasize the relevance, as we experience a work, of the variant images of it that we have in our minds (arising from reproductions or previous viewings, perhaps in different settings). On this basis he can plausibly claim that the alteration or destruction of a painting does not really efface the text that existed prior to those actions because the " memorial text" will have a continuing existence (p. 64). He is obviously breaking down the boundaries between works of art and the rest of life. Indeed, his extended, and fascinating, discussion (pp. 157-177) of Jackson Pollock's Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist ) is entitled "Outside yet Inside" and examines how the National Gallery space where it is displayed , the adjacent paintings, the moving crowds of observers, the title on the museum label, the label itself, and the bug caught in the paint (with the S-shaped path it left) are related to, or become part of, the work. 32 In the course of his commentary, when pointing out that Clement Greenberg contributed the title Lavender Mist, Grigely recognizes that intention is a part of history: "textual differences need to be understood in relation to their sources," for otherwise one "would be unmaking cultural history" (p. 173). He is trying to make the recovery of historical stages in the text of an artwork comparable to that of a literary work, and his approach to art can in turn be applied to literature. In both, " intentions are inevitably shared and contested" (p. 174), and the "inside" of a work, whether visual or verbal, is "always realigning itself and being realigned" (p. 179), according to the verbal and nonverbal information (such as museum labels or bookbindings) used by those experiencing the work. All textual transformations are to be respected as expressions of culture, which " depends on remaking texts in order to exist" (p. 179); and textual criticism therefore enables us to discover that "the history of cultural objects . . . is not linear but discursive" (p. 180). Grigely's brilliant account of the social construction of texts surpasses in insight and eloquence the more famous treatments that are generally cited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Another characteristic of writing on textual criticism in English in the last years of the twentieth century was an increase in awareness of editorial traditions in non-English-speaking countries. Within those countries—especially France, Germany, and Italy—editorial theory has been a flourishing area of discussion, and numerous books, anthologies, and articles, as well as editions, have resulted. But knowledge of the positions taken in these voluminous publications has been slow in coming to English-speaking scholars. Studies in Bibliography took the lead in 1975 by publishing an essay by Hans Zeller explaining the German interest in versions; but then a dozen years passed before English-speaking readers were given much more information. The 1987 volume of Text and the 1988 volume of Studies in Bibliography each contained four essays in English by prominent French and German textual theorists. 33 And it was also in 1987 that the German journal Editio began publication , carrying the word "Internationales" in its subtitle; although most of its contents have been in German, it has also published articles in English and has even included in its series of Beihefte a large anthology of essays in English on problems encountered by "editors or critical users of English editions" ( Problems of Editing, edited by Christa Jansohn, 1999). The elaborately produced French journal Génésis (1992- ), being the organ of a single school of editing, critique génétique, has been more parochial; but English-speaking readers can gain an idea of its aims from Graham Falconer's assessment of the first six numbers. 34 During the 1995-2000 period, several concise (and generally excellent) accounts of foreign traditions were published in English, both in Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research (edited by D. C. Greetham in 1995) and, the same year, in a collection of pieces on the influence of Fredson Bowers abroad. 35 For more expansive treatments during these years, one must turn to three large American anthologies (one on the dominant German emphasis and two—one of them not primarily in English—on the French), along with several articles in Text and Editio. 36 The anthology on German editing— Contemporary German Editorial Theory (1995), edited by Hans Walter Gabler, George Bornstein, and Gillian Borland Pierce—contains translations, published for the first time, of ten essays originally published in German from 1971 to 1991. Three (by Hans Zeller, Miroslav Červenka, and Elisabeth HöpkerHersberg) are from the historic 1971 anthology Texte und Varianten and three (by Zeller, Gunter Martens, and Henning Boetius) from a special 1975 number of LiLi, and the final four are essays by Siegfried Scheibe (1982, 1990-91), Martens (1989), and Gerhard Seidel (1982). Thus the three major figures—Martens, Scheibe, and Zeller—are represented by two essays apiece, and the whole selection serves well enough to give English-speaking readers some sense of the development of German textual theory in the 1970s and 1980s. But whether the volume is useful in any other way seems doubtful. If the editors expected these essays to have a current value, they should at least have attempted to answer the criticisms that have since been made of the position set forth in the essays. But Gabler's introduction does not even recognize those criticisms ; instead, it simply sums up the position, repeating the logical flaws inherent in it without seeming to notice them. The result is not conducive to winning over new admirers of the approach. Near the beginning of his introduction, for example, Gabler says that the "salient points" of current Anglo-American textual criticism were anticipated by German theory, which "radically holds . . . that eclecticism is unsound as a method, and that authorial intention is unknowable or unstable as a guiding principle for critical editing" (p. 2). A value of the newly translated essays, he believes, is to show these positions "argued in their original intellectual environment." That is a historical aim, but if the essays are to be relevant in the present state of the discussion, Gabler cannot ignore the replies that have been made to criticisms of eclecticism and intention; he does not of course have to accept those replies, but he must bring them into the discussion and, if he rejects them, show why they are faulty. Thus the two adjectives that he applies to intention, "unknowable" and "unstable," raise questions that cannot be avoided. To call intention "unknowable" usually means that it cannot be found concretely expressed in a document and that it is therefore "ahistoric" (a word Gabler applies to "the ideality of the author" [p. 4]). But historical scholarship in other areas is not limited to the "knowable" in this sense; most historical events, like intended texts, must be reconstructed, and we can never be certain about all their details . To attempt such reconstructions is not to be ahistorical, unhistorical , or anti-historical. It is hard to imagine any historian, outside of the field of textual studies, who would wish to claim that every extrapolation from tangible evidence is unsound. And the point about intention being "unstable" is inappropriate in two ways: the implication that intentionalist editors do not recognize the shifting nature of authors' intentions is incorrect; and the instability of intentions, which is a primary reason for the variation among textual versions, is in fact at the heart of the approach Gabler advocates. His belief that eclecticism is "unsound" stems from the same illogical notion that the only historical texts are those that exist in surviving documents. 37 And the German focus on those tangible texts leads him to maintain, "Where the Anglo-American endeavor has tended to edit the author, the central German concern over the past decades has increasingly become to edit the text" (p. 2). What renders this statement nonsensical is of course the lack of parallelism between "author" and "text." One cannot edit an author but only the text of an author, and thus both groups of editors, not merely the German, are editing texts. His statement obviously means to place in opposition "texts of authors" and "texts of documents." A few pages later, surprisingly, he admits that the former has a value: a sentence begins, "Without denying the legitimacy of editing what the author intended" (p. 6). (How this is consistent with his earlier denigration of intention is difficult to understand.) If a critically emended text aimed at reconstructing one stage of the author's intention is legitimate, after all, then what is wrong with printing such a text in an edition, with an appended record of the variants in the surviving documents, just as intentionalist editors have regularly done? Gabler, and those holding the point of view he advocates, would answer that such an edition emphasizes, or "privileges," the critically reconstructed text over the documentary texts by offering the latter only in the compressed form of an apparatus subordinated to the fully presented critical text. Yet Gabler's description of German editions does not make them seem very different. The "aim of a German edition," he says, is to provide "a segment or slice from the text's history"—"an historically defined version of the work"—around which "the edition organizes the entire textual history in apparatus form" (p. 3). If this were the full story, one could say that the German approach, like the intentionalist, results in editions that present the bulk of the textual history of a work in apparatus form; the only difference between the two would then be that the text presented in full is in one case a critically reconstructed text and in the other a documentary text. But Gabler says more: he refers to the text presented in full as an "edited text," with "emendation functioning exclusively to remove the textual error." How can he not see that this acceptance of emendation undercuts his whole position? The text presented in full is no longer the text of a material document, and the difference between it and an intentionalist editor's critical text is not a difference in kind: any correction of "error" involves intention, and the fallacy of limiting oneself to only one kind of error (however defined, which is of course a difficult problem in itself) has been exposed many times. Underlying this whole jumble , as with most complaints about eclecticism, is an untenable equation of "version" and "document": when an editor emends the text of an earlier document with certain variants present in a later one, the result is not necessarily a mixing of versions, because some variants in the later document may be merely corrections of errors in the earlier document, not evidence of a new version. Gabler's acceptance of corrections is in fact an acceptance of eclecticism . Why he is willing to countenance any alteration of documentary texts is incomprehensible, since he views an edition strictly as a compendium of documentary information. The "German scholarly edition ," he claims, "is aimed less at the reader than at the user of the edition"; the test of its success is "how well it encodes the text in the history of its material writing and transmission by an appropriate and adequate apparatus format" (p. 7). The shocking distinction between "reader" and "user" suggests that reading and textual study are separate activities, whereas in truth they are inextricable: textual scholarship depends on close reading, and the richest kind of reading grows out of a knowledge of a work's textual history and variation. Scholarly editions in the intentionalist tradition recognize this connection by including critically reconstructed reading texts (the results of the editors' reading ) in the same volumes as the historical data needed for the informed critical reading of those texts. The difference between these editions and the German editions described by Gabler is simply that the latter do not take this additional step; both are in agreement on the importance of the historical record. Gabler's incoherent discussion, with its eagerness to find fault with the so-called Anglo-American approach, gives no sense of the real relationship between these two traditions. Since Gabler's summary of the essays in the volume is accurate, the essays themselves are unfortunately as full of problems as Gabler's introduction is. For example, Zeller's 1971 essay is translated as saying that authorial intention "should be replaced by the concept of authorization "; the "editor's duty is to determine and reproduce authorized versions " (p. 25). Yet the rule that "authorization is binding" can be relaxed "in the case of certain instances termed textual faults," which "entitle and oblige the editor to textual intervention (emendation)" (p. 28). This concession recognizes that authorized texts as they stand in documents do not always reflect what the authors meant to authorize (that is, they do not always reflect the authors' intentions); but if an editor is allowed to make any emendations for the purpose of restoring the author's intention, there would seem to be no logical way of arguing that only obvious errors can be corrected or of saying, in effect, that one should take only a first step toward reconstructing an intended text and not go as far as one can to bring it about. Certainly the text Zeller sanctions is no longer a "reproduction" of a documentary text. In Zeller's 1975 essay, the same point is made, and in a manner that sounds like an "Anglo-American" editor: "one must edit versions, and must edit every version either in extenso or by recording its variants"; and passages with "textual faults" not only "allow" but "demand an intervention by the critical editor" (p. 107). 38 Zeller, unaware that he has thus abolished the equation of versions with documentary texts, fails to see that intentionalist editors have carried to its logical conclusion the insight that he has falteringly introduced into his argument against intention as an editorial goal. That this anthology has its limitations was pointed out by Bodo Plachta (author of Editionswissenschaft, 1997) in an essay for the 1999 volume of Text: 39 he says that the collection gives a "one-sided impression of a discussion in Germany that is in fact of a much broader and more flexible nature" (p. 36). To help fill out the picture, he examines several editions that illustrate how the selection of a "base-text" varies according to the textual history of each work. He also comments on the increasing production of facsimiles of manuscripts and usefully points out that critical editions "based on the principles of textual criticism"— what he calls " `classical' editions"—are "still the main characteristic of German editorial practice" (p. 43). But if his essay suggests the variety of German editing, it does nothing to further understanding of the issues involved. It exhibits the common confusion between theoretical and practical matters and does not recognize the pointlessness of discussing whether facsimiles can stand on their own. 40 Throughout he emphasizes that German editors focus on the "historically authentic" text (e.g., pp. 35, 40); but he never questions the equation of that term with something like "present in a single surviving document," nor does he ask why an interest in socially constructed texts requires one not to be interested in authorially intended texts. A far more penetrating response to the German anthology came from Peter L. Shillingsburg at about the same time, in the 1998 volume of Editio. 41 After an overly concessive start, his essay reaches an outspoken conclusion. He identifies "the main issue of difference between AngloAmerican and Germanic editing" as "the role of individual judgment and of emendation in scholarly editing" (p. 138). Another way of putting the point, as the last part of the essay makes clear, is to say that the central question concerns the "stage" of textual work to be presented to the public: the German approach "cuts off the exercise of interpretation at an early stage" (p. 148), whereas the Anglo-American adds a "critically edited, eclectic text" to "the archival record" (p. 149). Using two examples , one from Goethe and the other from Thackeray, he shows that such "non-extant texts" sometimes provide "the only way to see a work as the product of the authorial trajectory of textual development," for "authorized" texts often contain revisions that do not reflect the author's intention ("miscarriages of delegated authority"). He is not saying that any one text is adequate by itself but that taking "a step beyond the documentary edition," adding one or more emended texts, is important for showing a historical stage not available (or easily extractable) from an exclusively documentary apparatus. The essay could have made even clearer a contradiction in the German approach: that its emphasis on existing texts suggests an interest in the social production and reception of texts, whereas its concern with authorization reflects an interest in authors, which is not served well by a prohibition against most emendations of documentary texts. 42 As Shillingsburg says at the end, "when the inhibitions [surrounding individual judgment] become so draconian that the only allowable behavior is to publish undigested and undifferentiated data, it is time for a revolution" (p. 149). One would be well advised to skip the German anthology altogether and read Shillingsburg's essay instead. The French movement called critique génétique has been treated in substantial special numbers of two American journals, Romanic Review and Word &amp; Image. The first of these, the May 1995 number of Romanic Review (86.3, edited by Michael Riffaterre and Antoine Compagnon), prints most of the papers from an April 1994 symposium organized by Compagnon, Almuth Grésillon, and Henri Mitterand with the purpose of bringing together representatives of the Anglo-American and the French approaches to textual study. The volume is largely in French, however, the only English contributions being part of Compagnon's introduction (the part on genetic criticism), a paper of mine called " Critical Editions, Hypertexts, and Genetic Criticism" (pp. 581-593), and four case studies on the manuscripts of English and American authors. 43 Although this publication will therefore not serve as a basic source for English-speaking readers, Compagnon's introduction (pp. 393-401) is well worth their attention, not only for its concise account of critique génétique but also for the penetrating questions that it asks about this approach. It begins by noting that the approach "claims to be criticism, because it gives primacy to interpretation over editing, and genetic, because its ultimate goal is . . . to elucidate the stages of the creative process" (p. 394), and he proceeds to probe these claims. He wonders whether critique génétique is actually a new paradigm for criticism or "just helpful advice " (p. 395) that calls our attention to the importance of manuscript variants. He asks whether the avant-texte (the text of the drafts preceding publication, which are the object of these critics' study) is a "new object," not simply the "old manuscript" (p. 396), and finds some justification for the idea that French genetic criticism does focus on a newly conceived class of objects, since it does not see textual states in terms of a hierarchical or teleological relationship. (One has to be careful when making this point, since genetic study does involve an ordering; but the order is chronological, and chronology—it is important to remember—is not synonymous with progress.) Compagnon also explains that French genetic critics are generally opposed to the construction of editions, on the grounds that an apparatus of variants, derived from the classical model in which variants are departures from an author's final text, is inappropriate for an authorial avant-texte and implies a subordination of it. He properly points out that this attitude is partly conditioned by the fact that traditional French editions have focused on authors' final texts, and he asks whether genetic critics would have felt the same way if they had been responding to Anglo-American editions that followed Greg's rationale. Since such editions have often used early copy-texts, it is true that their apparatuses of post-copy-text variants may be thought to have a similarity to those of classical editions when they largely record nonauthorial departures from authors' finished texts. But Compagnon might have been more explicit in noting that nonauthorial readings are just as rife in the lifetime texts of modern authors (scribes' and typists' alterations, publishers' revisions, compositors' errors) as they are in the posthumous texts of ancient authors ; genetic criticism must deal with such variations, both before and after the point of publication, if it is truly to delineate authors' revisional processes. And Compagnon might also have noted that an interest in discussing revisions does not rule out listing them in apparatus form and that the Anglo-American tradition has certainly not been inimical to discursive treatments of variants, both within editions and as separate articles and books. It is hard to see critique génétique as a distinctive approach, and perhaps Compagnon is right to ask whether it may be only "the institutional definition and legitimation of a research group [ITEM, the Institut des Textes et Manuscrits Modernes] at the CNRS [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]" (p. 394). As with the German emphasis on versions, it seems to reflect a limited focus that is in fact subsumed under the more comprehensive Anglo-American approach. Indeed, in my contribution to the collection, I point out that critically edited texts focusing on authorial intention fit perfectly with the aims of critique génétique , for genetic critics, in their analyses of the creative process, are concerned with what authors intended at each stage. A series of critical texts (whether offered in full or in apparatus form, or in a combination of the two approaches) would seem the natural accompaniment to essays discussing the evidence for what authors were attempting at particular moments . That evidence, as Compagnon recognizes, is never as ample as one would wish, and the full story of any act of creativity will never be told. But self-styled genetic critics have no monopoly on being interested in making the attempt to tell the story as thoroughly as possible. The other special number, the April-June 1997 number of Word &amp; Image (13.2), entitled "Genetic Criticism," is almost entirely in English, but it contains no contribution that displays the critical independence of Compagnon's introduction. Nevertheless, the fact that it offers translations of essays by prominent members of the ITEM group—Almuth Grésillon, Pierre-Marc de Biasi, Jacques Neefs, and Claire Bustarret (the guest editor)—means that it gives English-speaking readers a fuller introduction to the ITEM point of view than the other collection does. Indeed, the opening piece, by Grésillon (former director of ITEM and author of Éléments de critique génétique, 1994), is a convenient summary of the basic position. Entitled "Slow—Work in Progress" (pp. 106123) it makes the claim that "genetic criticism established a new perspective on literature," with its "vision" of literature "as an activity" (p. 106), a vision that "goes hand in hand with a desire to de-sacralize and demythify the so-called `definitive' text" (p. 107). As this comment suggests, the article repeats the superficial points about scholarly editions regularly made by exponents of critique génétique: the "pre-text," Grésillon says, plays a role "different . . . from the role of appendix that `variations' often play in critical editions, where they are removed from their genetic context, simply added on at the end of the book as a critical afterthought" (p. 117). The misunderstanding here almost seems willful, and it is certainly counterproductive. The most substantial other general essay in the collection is Pierre-Marc de Biasi's "Horizons for Genetic Studies" (pp. 124-134; translated by Jennifer A. Jones), which systematically goes through all the arts, verbal and nonverbal, pointing out how the "model for genetic analysis that emerges from the study of modern literary manuscripts can, without any possible doubt, be extended to other fields of creation" (p. 124). That "the archives of creation" in all fields are worth studying is an important point, though its recognition has hardly depended on critique génétique. In an article in the 1999 volume of Text, de Biasi attempts, less successfully , a "typology" of French genetic editions, using the image of "layers" that make up a chronologically ordered "stack" of documents, constituting the entirety of the archive for a particular work. 44 He divides genetic editions into two types, the "horizontal," which concentrate on one layer or "phase," and the "vertical," which attempt as far as possible to "reconstitute the writing process from the beginning to the end" (p. 26); the "horizontal" category is subdivided according to whether or not the work was finally published, the "vertical" according to whether the edition is "unabridged" or "partial." Because he gives examples of actual editions that illustrate these categories, some readers will find his article useful as an introductory guide to the variety of genetic scholarship that has been undertaken. On the theoretical level, however, his article leaves much to be desired. For example, it does not deal satisfactorily with the distinction between physical document and stage of revision (more than one of which may occupy a single document, as de Biasi recognizes); the problem begins with the layer/stack metaphor , which emphasizes physical objects and which is therefore not conducive to thinking about entities that may share a single object. 45 His classification scheme also suffers from lack of parallelism in its construction , illogically mixing the conceptual and the practical (as in the subdivisions mentioned above). And when, among his various attempts to accommodate the infinity of possible situations, he says that "the layer is itself a stack" (placed within a larger stack), one begins to wonder how real the distinctions are: how different is a horizontal edition of such a stacked layer from a "partial vertical edition"? This pretentious and verbose article is not an effective introduction to its subject. Another overblown effort, Klaus Hurlebusch's long essay in the 2000 volume of Text, has the worthy aim of providing "a more comprehensive understanding of literary production" through a combination of the German emphasis on authorship with the French emphasis on the writing itself. 46 It begins with what would seem an unnecessary question and provides an unsurprising answer: the question asks what relevance drafts have to literary study as opposed to psychology, and the answer (an obvious one, if not worded in an obvious way) is that they are relevant if "regarded as witness documents distinguished only materially from other witness documents—such as printings of a work—and if they are accorded a mediate hermeneutic significance as `preliminary' or ` developmental stages' of the achieved, valid text" (p. 67). More than thirty pages of such prose later, Hurlebusch concludes by arguing that genetic representation should serve "to cull not only the document contents from the `witnesses,' but to recover from the documents' iconicity their paratextual nature" (p. 99). In other words, one should study all the physical evidence in the documents. This point is of course correct and important , but what is alarming here is the failure to recognize adequately not only that the distinction between the textual and the "paratextual" is not a simple one but also that the transcription of the "contents" depends on the analysis of every detail of the document. If Hurlebusch had fully understood analytical bibliography (or codicology, or paleography , or whatever one wishes to call it), his discussion would have been very different, and some of the problems he labors over would have been clarified. Some glimpses of the activity in other countries, especially Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, are offered by several additional articles in Text. The 1998 piece by Paola Pugliatti 47 not only surveys the development of variantistica in Italy but also compares that approach, which studies variants in their developmental context ("a set of steps aiming at some form of finality"), with critique génétique, which looks at drafts as separate entities (without "any idea of progressive esthetic ` achievement ' "). But she quite properly observes that they are linked by a similar "aporia" or "contradiction," for both—in spite of their avowed focus— have to deal "with the transition from synchrony to diachrony, from structure to process, from the event to its history" (p. 186). She is in fact recognizing the artificiality of the limitation that each approach insists on. A less comprehensive article by Alberto Varvaro in the next volume of Text 48 finds a connection between the great prestige of textual criticism in Italy and its long tradition of dealing with modern literature. Varvaro generalizes rather too broadly at times, as in saying that American textual critics, unlike the Italians, have been "blinded by deconstructionism " (p. 57); but he (speaking for "we Italians") is wise in the general direction of his remarks, which hold that the study of variants need not lead one to regard "data banks" of documentary texts as the principal goal of editorial activity. Four essays in Text on Spanish and Dutch editing show a less clearly defined situation. 49 Of the two essays on Spanish, both in the 1995 volume, David R. Whitesell's has greater depth than Carol Bingham Kirby's, but both make many of the same points. Although the stemmatic method (of which Kirby is an active proponent) has been much used for editing Golden Age drama, a variety of kinds of editions has in fact appeared since the 1960s—reflecting the same issues concerning performance versions and authorial intentions that have underlain the debates among editors of English Renaissance drama. Despite this congruence of concerns , Whitesell observes that "Hispanists have responded slowly to advances in textual criticism made in other fields" (p. 84). The Dutch picture, similar in some ways, is characterized by two contributors to the 2000 volume of Text, largely through case studies. H. T. M. van Vliet, then the director of the Constantijn Huygens Instituut (founded in 1983 as a government bureau for editing Dutch literature), sketches the history of Dutch editing: its great Renaissance accomplishment and its failure before the mid-1970s to think about methods for dealing with vernacular literature. The resulting need to catch up with developments in other countries caused post-1975 Dutch editors to draw as needed on different traditions, especially the Anglo-American and the German. Both van Vliet and Annemarie Kets-Vree, the other author (another editor at the Huygens Instituut), comment on the "methodological eclecticism" (to use Kets-Vree's phrase) of Dutch editing. This eclecticism suggests what thoughtful readers of all these essays must conclude: that each of these approaches—the German, the French, and the Italian, to the extent that it is fair to identify national traditions—has important observations to contribute but that each one by itself deals only with a limited aspect of textual history. We should be grateful that accounts of these national approaches are increasingly being made available in English , but they serve to underscore the dangers of all positions that lack comprehensiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III It is not surprising that a considerable body of writing in the last years of the twentieth century was devoted to electronic editions, just as the role and effect of computers in other areas of life have been the subject of ubiquitous discussion. The first book that comes to mind when one thinks of the use of computers in editing is Peter L. Shillingsburg's Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age, a third edition of which appeared in 1996. This book, since its first appearance in 1984, 50 has become established as a basic guide, and it deserves its success not only because it is well-informed and sensible but also because it deals with the complexities of electronic publication in the context of the issues that inform all scholarly editing. As the title suggests, the book is essentially an introduction to scholarly editing, one that takes into particular account the advantages of electronic presentation; it recognizes that editors who wish to make the most effective use of electronic capabilities must be thoroughly cognizant of the various goals of scholarly editing and of the divergent but complementary views of literature that underlie them. Electronic publication, in other words, is only a means to the ends that scholarly editions have always had. For the 1996 edition of his book, Shillingsburg (besides making local revisions throughout) 51 has added two new chapters: "Critical Editions," coming at the end of the first section of the book ("Theory"), and " Electronic Editions," placed at the end of the final section ("Practicalities"). Both are excellent basic statements, concise and lucid, and constitute a good reason for readers already familiar with this book to look at it again. "Critical Editions" skillfully outlines the bases for authorial and sociological editing and explains why both are necessary and why arguments denigrating one or the other are not productive. 52 As Shillingsburg says, we can gain more insights into authors and works "with a variety of tools than with just one" (p. 100). His chapter on "Electronic Editions " is important for stating emphatically that scholarly editors "bring to electronic publishing all the concerns of textual criticism that occupied us in the first part of this book" (p. 163). In other words, an electronic edition is a form of presentation and, as such, does not pose a different set of theoretical issues from the one faced by editors who present their work in a different form. Note that Shillingsburg uses the phrase "electronic publishing" here, just as he does in the opening of the first sentence of this chapter, immediately below the title "Electronic Editions ." Despite the false parallelism of the two new chapter titles, reinforced by the symmetry of their placement, the one on "Electronic Editions " does come in the section called "Practicalities," and Shillingsburg clearly understands that an electronic edition can also be a critical edition. Indeed, it will be more useful if it contains critical as well as documentary texts. An electronic "archive"—as an electronic collection of documentary texts, both in transcribed (searchable) form and in image form, is often called—is likely to seem "an undigested chaos of material in which everyone must become an editor before proceeding" (p. 165). It should at least be "webbed or networked with cross-references connecting variant texts, explanatory notes, contextual materials, and parallel texts," along with introductions and variorum commentary. But beyond that, "authorial editors . . . will, in the electronic edition as in the print edition, provide an edited, critical, eclectic text representing their notion of what the text should have been—the new text webbed and cross-referenced into the archive" (p. 166). Such a text is unquestionably an appropriate part of an electronic edition—though Shillingsburg might have made clearer the desirability of multiple critical texts, reflecting different stages of authorial intention as well as one or more stages of collaborative intention (since scribal or printed texts do not necessarily reflect their makers' intentions fully). After all, the space available for presenting multiple texts in full is the basis for the many advantages that electronic editions offer; and just as a wide array of documentary texts should be made available, so should a series of critical texts. Although Shillingsburg's treatment of electronic matters as " practicalities " is one of the most valuable aspects of his discussion, he does sometimes verge on asserting the kind of excessive conceptual claims for electronic texts that less thoughtful writers often make. For example, he says that the electronic medium gives scholarly editors "opportunities to extend their notions of what constitutes the work of art and how it can be read" (p. 163). Or again: "The electronic medium has extended the textual world; . . . it has added dimensions and ease of mobility to our concepts of textuality" (p. 164). Ease of mobility, yes, for the most part; but "dimensions" added to our "concepts of textuality"? Our "notions of what constitutes the work of art" are not limited or impoverished by the codex form; what is often hampered by that form is the facility with which we can read variants in context and move back and forth between corresponding passages of different texts. We could always do these things, but often it took a great deal of effort to do so. When Shillingsburg says that "students of a text will more readily than was ever the case in print editions be able to confront textual cruxes for themselves" (p. 166), he comes nearer the point, since students could confront cruxes in printed editions also; but I would delete "be able to" from his sentence, because one is able to study cruxes "readily" in either case, and the real point is that in many instances one can probably study them "more readily" in electronic texts. 53 Shillingsburg thinks that the electronic edition is "a tool for students of a work" and "not primarily . . . a place to sit [ sic ] and read through a novel or poem for a first-time experience of the work or for the pleasure of a good read" (p. 165). The same could be said for scholarly editions in printed form, which are often read in nonlinear fashion. But of course the main text in a printed edition, especially if it is free of symbols, can be read for pleasure, simply because it is in the familiar codex form. And we may confidently say that ebooks, which are improving rapidly, will eventually be accepted as a pleasant form in which to read the texts of an electronic edition. They may even help to break down the distinction between "a tool for students" and a vehicle for "a good read," bringing to more people the pleasures of textual awareness. Even though Shillingsburg's chapter would have benefited from greater attention to such points, it remains a fine introduction, manifesting a sensible outlook and offering in concise and readable form a considerable amount of advice on technical matters. Shillingsburg has written about electronic editions in other places as well, such as his short article entitled "Principles for Electronic Archives , Scholarly Editions, and Tutorials" (on pages 23-35 of the Finneran anthology to be discussed below). Although he gives far more attention to the "archives" of his title than to the "editions," his phrase "archive of editions" (p. 24) shows that his concept of the archive is broad enough to encompass critical editions. (Critical editions, after all, even those newly produced, are documents in the history of a work.) Shillingburg's piece is essentially an outline of desirable "industry standards " for editions (capability of handling multimedia and accessibility on different hardware platforms) and of "ideal goals" (including searchable texts along with images, linkages among texts, and appropriate encoding) ; it ends with a list of "general principles" regarding usability, transportability, archive specifications, security, integrity, expandability, printability, and convenience (largely reprinted from a document of his that was distributed at the 1993 meeting of the Modern Language Association of America, one that became part of the background for the draft guidelines issued in 1997 by the MLA's Committee on Scholarly Editions) . He is concerned here with technical, not editorial, considerations; and although the points he makes are elementary, there is clearly a value in having a concise statement of basic points from a person with Shillingsburg's extensive experience with electronic editions. After Shillingsburg, the most prominent writer on electronic editing is Jerome McGann, whose "The Rationale of HyperText" has been made available in several places. 54 That title, with its definite article, is an obvious allusion to Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," and McGann explicitly states that he wrote the piece "in a conscious revisionary relation to W. W. Greg's great essay" (p. 32). McGann's reputation and the portentousness of his title arouse great expectations, which the piece itself unfortunately does not fulfill. Although he is well aware of the plethora of "Lofty reflections on the cultural significance of information technology" (p. 11), he comes close to supplying another one, for he tries to endow a simple practical point with unwarranted philosophical significance . 55 The simple point is this: electronic texts and hypermedia archives often allow one to do many desirable things more easily than one could accomplish them using the codex form. Linkages between texts are obviously facilitated by the electronic medium, and it is clearly better to have oral texts (when they are relevant) embedded in the same framework as visible texts, rather than furnished in the form of recordings slipped into a pocket at the back of a book. No one needs a " rationale " to understand why a more efficient tool should replace a less efficient one. When he concentrates on practical advice, which is what the essay is really about, he makes good sense. For example, he wisely distinguishes between a word-processed text and a hyperedited one, for the former is not greatly different from what is encountered in a printed book, whereas hyperediting uses "computerization as a means to secure freedom from the analytic limits of hard copy text" (p. 15). And his advice to use a hypermedia program in a hyperediting project, in order to accommodate auditory and visible documents, is obviously sound, since doing so takes fullest advantage of what the electronic medium offers. As he repeatedly asks, in one form or another, "Why would anyone wish to do without it?" Two other pieces of advice are to design a project in terms of its "largest and most ambitious goals," not in terms of "immediate hardware or software options," and to structure the program in the "most modular and flexible way," so that technical advances can be imported into it with as little disruption as possible (p. 16). This is just common sense, and not part of a "rationale," but I would not wish to object to the uttering of common sense. What I do find objectionable, and indeed unnecessary, is the philosophical framework into which his sensible advice is set. He begins by distinguishing between works of the literary imagination and "textual works that are instruments of scientific knowledge" (p. 12). It is surprising that anyone would still take this notion seriously. The construction of every work made of words (as of other media) involves rhetorical choices, and thus artistry; and the presentation of every such work, whether in oral or tangible form, affects its meaning as taken in by listeners or readers. To draw a fixed line between works of the imagination and works of scientific knowledge is impossible because all works are combinations of both kinds of understanding (if indeed they really are two kinds). Yet McGann is willing to say flatly, "To the imagination the materialities of text (oral, written, printed, electronic) are incarnational not vehicular forms. But for the scientist and scholar, the media of expression are primarily conceptual utilities, means rather than ends" (p. 12). Literary critics, however, as McGann well knows, do not exclude from their investigative domain works of expository prose, even when the authors are scholars and scientists. In any case, debating the point (which has itself been the subject of a considerable literature) is irrelevant to a discussion of scholarly editing, for all verbal works, regardless of how one classifies them, are equally in need of the application of textual scholarship. 56 It is nevertheless easy to see why McGann felt it necessary to go into this matter. Since the position for which he is well known holds that the texts of literary works include their visible (and oral) presentations, he has to regard scholarly editions as being treatises about the texts of literary works, not presentations of those texts, in order to justify the use, in an edition, of a different physical medium (such as the electronic, which it is the purpose of the essay to advocate) from the one in which the work first appeared. Therefore he says at the outset, "My remarks here apply only to textual works that are instruments of scientific knowledge " (p. 12). (This caveat would logically have been required, of course, even if he were writing about scholarly printed editions, since those editions cannot ever be the equivalent of the original printings of the works concerned.) The price he pays for trying to maintain his position in this fashion is an illogical wavering between a focus on authorial intention and a focus on collaborative social results. For if material media are "incarnational" (in the sense of being the opposite of "vehicular") to creators of literary works, then the claim that scholarly editions, with their different physical incarnation, are scientific works (no longer the original imaginative works) reflects an emphasis on authorial intention. Yet McGann's interest in the visible (or oral) product is in other respects an attempt to place intention within a social context, where nonauthorial intentions in particular areas often outweigh the authorial ones. And in that case, later editions (including scholarly ones) ought also to be renditions of the work as it emerges from different social settings. This tangle could have been avoided if McGann had been willing to accept one simple point: that authors of verbal works do not always consider the physical presentation of their words (or some aspects of it) to be a part of the works themselves, even though it always (1) reflects to some extent the intentions of those responsible for the presentation and (2) affects the responses of those who experience the presentation. From the point of view of authorial intention, therefore, the physical forms of some verbal works are indeed only "vehicular," and scholarly editions using different vehicles (whether different typefaces and paper, or a computer terminal instead of paper) can in those cases reproduce the texts of the works. This point in no way lessens the importance of studying the social forms of texts, which necessarily include physical components; but it eliminates the necessity for claiming that scholarly editions cannot transmit the texts of works but only information about those texts. After this unfortunate beginning, McGann weakens his essay further with another fallacious piece of theorizing. As a reason for preferring hyperediting to the editing that was presented in codex form, he asserts that there is something problematical about using "books to study books, or hard copy texts to analyze other hard copy texts" (p. 12). At first one may think he is saying something analogous to the often-made point that we end up analyzing works of all media in the medium of language; but that point never carried the implication that there was an inherent problem in analyzing like with like—that, for instance, an effective criticism of a piece of music could not be a musical parody. McGann, however, believes that when one uses "books to analyze and study other books," "the scale of the tools seriously limits the possible results" (p. 12). He goes so far as to say that the problems with codex editions "arise because they deploy a book form to study another book form" (p. 13). Because? How does the similarity in form cause the problems? (One might even think it an advantage, to the extent that the codex edition can reproduce more of the physical features of the original codex publication.) His point is pretentious because it seems to adduce a theoretical principle, 57 when in fact no principle is required, other than the self-evident desirability of increased efficiency—and certainly not a principle, like this one, without substance. The limitations of the codex form are limitations regardless of whether one is dealing with another codex. And that is all McGann is talking about: the increased maneuverability afforded by electronic presentation. 58 Whether electronic conveniences can be said to "lift one's general level of attention to a higher order" (p. 12) is really a matter of how inflated one is willing to let one's rhetoric become in order to register one's enthusiasm for hypertext. The "level of attention" displayed by the best scholars of the past is not likely to be surpassed, but hypertext unquestionably reduces the drudgery involved in carrying out some kinds of investigation. 59 If McGann's efforts to provide a theoretical depth to his advocacy of hypertext are unsuccessful, the five brief case studies that constitute the heart of his essay are informative, 60 and he ends with an important point about the "decentered text." This term does not mean what one might expect: it simply refers to the idea that in hypertext there is no need for one central text as an organizing focus. McGann suggests that this point has aroused debate, but I do not see how anyone could maintain the contrary position. Hypertext, as McGann says, does have a structure "organized for directed searches and analytic operations" (p. 29), but because one is free to browse among numerous full texts, assisted by links, no one text is required to serve as a base, as is generally the situation in codex editions, where lack of space usually necessitates representing some texts in apparatus form. McGann's comparison of the organization of hypertext with that of a library is essentially right in that "every documentary moment" in both cases "is absolute with respect to the archive as a whole" (p. 31). 61 But because his focus is primarily on the archival function of hypertext, he says little about the various helps that one might reasonably expect a hyperedition to provide. These helps, resulting from the editor's research, would provide much more information about the relationships among the texts than a library does; but—and this is the crucial point here—such guidance, however extensive, would not affect the independence of the texts and would leave readers free to choose whatever points of entry and subsequent paths they wished. Another consequence of his concentration on archives is that he does not distinguish two kinds of decentering that are worth differentiating. The decentering he deals with is on the mechanical level: the mechanics of the electronic medium, in contrast to that of the codex, does not lead to an apparent emphasis by default on one text over another. A second kind of decentering applies to the construction of critical texts. In my essay on "Editing without a Copy-Text" (commented on at the end of part V below), I recommend a procedure for critical editing in which one does not give any text the centrality of a copy-text. Instead of thinking of a critical text as an emended form of a copy-text, one conceives it as a new text in which each word or punctuation mark derives from whatever source (including the editor's mind) is judged to give the best reading in terms of the goal chosen (author's first—or last, or some other— intention, publisher's intention, and so on). If this approach were used for an edition published as a codex, the newly constructed critical text would still (in most cases) be a centered text in the mechanical sense, with the other relevant texts provided as an apparatus keyed to it; but it would have been formed by an editorial process that did not center any one text. The process can obviously be used for an edition in electronic form as well, with the result that one or more critical texts produced by this decentered method would be a part of the mechanically decentered collection of texts forming a portion of a hyperedition. One of the places where McGann's essay has been reprinted is Kathryn Sutherland's anthology Electronic Text: Investigations in Method and Theory (1997), which is based in part on a 1993 Oxford conference and which contains some other essays worth noting. Sutherland's introduction aims, as she says (in characteristic prose) at the end of it, to link "technological fashioning and change to the cultural developments that technology models and, in modelling, further validates as culturally significant" (p. 17). The case for such linkage, in her hands, is highly dubious, as one or two of her points may serve to suggest. She claims, for example, that electronic technology reinforces the ideas of Barthes and Kristeva and that editors are therefore in an environment of "permeable boundaries, of fluid text" where the "traditional assumptions " of scholarly editing "no longer appear to hold true." (One may pause to reflect that textual instability is what editors have always confronted , and recognized they were confronting; textual fluidity does not depend on the computer for its existence.) Of those "traditional assumptions," the "first to go is the work/text distinction," for "if the work is not confined to the historically contingent and the particular, it is nevertheless only in its expressive textual form that we encounter it, and material conditions determine meanings" (p. 5). But the "if" clause (followed by "nevertheless") concedes the necessity of recognizing that texts of works can be abstractions (sequences of words) as well as physical renderings; and her discussion of Barthes points out that he, too, made such a distinction. 62 She does not really mean that the distinction itself has been eliminated, and there is no necessity for eliminating it in order to make the point that "material conditions determine meanings." All she is trying to say is that many people (she among them, presumably) now prefer to read documentary texts rather than critically emended texts (though she does not confront the fact that every text put into physical form by an editor is also a "situated act or event" [p. 6]). Perhaps that is why she says that an edition is "more properly described in its electronic assemblage" as an "archive," which contains "the disassembled `texts' but not the reassembled `work' " (p. 9). To imply that editorially emended texts (the products of specialists ' reading) are not valuable is simply not to believe in scholarship. Her tendency to accept unthinkingly the exaggerated claims made for electronic editions is perfectly illustrated by her comment that "in making certain things easier" electronic presentation "makes the outcome different" (p. 9). We all welcome greater ease, but serious scholars have never allowed the labor involved in a task to prevent their carrying it out. Sutherland's introduction does not lead one to look forward to the essays that follow, and they do often display the same love of jargon and exaggeration (and sometimes even the same fuzziness of argument). Allen Renear, for instance, outlines three theories of textuality that have emerged from the text-encoding community without recognizing that their philosophical coherence is affected by the fact that they all developed in subordination to a program requiring belief that texts can be reproduced. And Julia Flanders's piece is weakened throughout by its initial assumption of the "electronic text's lack of, or freedom from, a body." But some useful points do get made. Peter M. W. Robinson (who claims to be talking about "new directions" in editing, when he is of course referring to new methods for helping us move in the directions we have always followed) explains, with examples, the importance of supplementing archival collections of texts with editorial aids, as do Patrick W. Conner and Peter S. Donaldson—the latter concluding with the valuable (if rarely expressed) observation that the "digital research environment" might be designed "so that the passage from text to document extends from the computer screen to the library"—to the original physical documents (p. 195). Possibly the best essay is Claire Lamont's discussion of annotation, which ably shows the interrelations of editing and annotation and which recognizes that the theoretical questions raised by annotation "are not removed in hypertext" (p. 61)—indeed, hypertext has simply "produced another arena in which the debate may continue" (p. 63). 63 The year before the Sutherland anthology, a more substantial and worthwhile anthology had appeared in the University of Michigan Press series on editorial theory— The Literary Text in the Digital Age (1996), edited by Richard J. Finneran. It begins with useful essays by Susan Hockey and Peter Shillingsburg. Hockey's surveys the history of using the computer for editing and summarizes basic information about text encoding and the delivery of electronic editions; Shillingsburg's is the piece on goals of scholarly editing that I have already commented on. The volume ends with an essay by John Unsworth that places "electronic scholarship in its larger cultural context" (p. 233), offering an intelligent criticism of those who are resistant to change (here epitomized by Sven Birkerts). Although the essay is not primarily about scholarly editing, it does suggest that the existence of electronic editions will increase the broader scholarly interest in editing and bibliographical scholarship because "the new technology opens up the possibility of re-creating the basic resources of all our activities and providing us with revolutionary tools for working with those resources" (p. 240). If he proves to be right, it will be because the tools are indeed revolutionary, not because technology has created a new "possibility," since the old tools also allowed for the recreation of basic resources (in the form of facsimiles and new editions). 64 Although he does not always manage to eschew hyperbole in speaking of new technology, his essay is ultimately balanced and sensible, concluding that the issues we have to deal with will not change. 65 In between these opening and closing essays, there are several technical articles and accounts of specific projects, along with some additional general pieces. The diversity of content can be illustrated by the essays of Charles L. Ross and Phillip E. Doss. 66 For Ross, "Recent trends in editing have signaled the demise of the Anglo-American critical edition and the imminent birth of electronic editing" (p. 227). Because this sentence confuses technical and theoretical matters, it is hard to know how to read it. Ross includes "codex book" (p. 225) in his definition of a critical edition, and one might think at first that he is simply predicting the triumph of one technology (electronic) over another (the codex). But "Anglo-American" brings in the idea of an emended text supplemented with an apparatus, a concept that is not tied to any one technology . The "birth of electronic editing," in other words, does not spell the death of critical editing, whether or not one feels that it dooms the codex form of presentation. No one would argue with his belief that readers should be able to "choose among variants, and thus create a (never the ) text" (p. 230), but he does not acknowledge that most editors of critical codex editions have held the same belief or that codex editions offer the same options for readers. It is certainly wrong to claim that the functions of editor and reader were "hitherto distinct": critical editions have always made clear that the act of reading involves making textual decisions. The Doss article, in contrast, despite its occasional repetition of standard exaggerations, 67 makes some valuable points, and makes them well. Doss is concerned, for example, that in the electronic environment "we remain aware of continuities, not only in regard to the telos of intellectual endeavor generally, but specifically in regard to the way in which the textual editor might employ electronic media in the tasks before him or her" (p. 215). He also urges that "editorial invisibility" be recognized as a pretense and that electronic editors should be " straightforward " in declaring the assumptions embedded in the linking structures they have created (p. 218). 68 This advice is of course equally valid for editors of electronic and of codex editions. Indeed, writings about electronic editing are generally successful to the extent that they recognize continuities (to use Doss's word): the computer, though it creates strong breaks with the past in our methods for doing things, does not alter the things that need to be done, or the concerns that cause us to want to do them. This point is well understood by John Lavagnino, who on more than one occasion has explained why such traditional activities of scholarly editors as annotation and emendation are just as important in electronic editions as they were before. 69 He calls it a professional "provinciality" to believe that "if we could only remove the editorial presence from the transmission of texts, readers would then have a true and complete perception of texts" (p. 121). 70 The fallacy of this view is forcefully set out: This idea, that we require no form of help with original documents, is not really very different from the idea that literary criticism is unnecessary because our untutored reactions to literary works are more authentic, and those reactions are likely to be repressed or distorted if we hear any discussion of what the texts mean. To refrain from editing is an easy way to alleviate our nagging professional worries about being wrong; but it also means that we lose the opportunity to be right about anything, and to give other readers the benefit of our perceptions. (p. 120) The more basic problem, he rightly believes, is that many literary scholars and other readers are not interested in textual history and therefore do not use the information provided in editions. For those who do, scholarly codex editions have not seemed officious or unusable (though many such readers will no doubt find electronic editions easier to use for some purposes); but the majority of readers still need to learn that the most rewarding reading requires (in Lavagnino's words) "a knowledge of textual matters, not just unmediated access to the originals (or rather to facsimiles of them)" (p. 122). It is encouraging to note that a recent special number of Literary &amp; Linguistic Computing (15.1, 2000), on "Making Texts for the Next Century ," opens with an essay in which Peter Robinson (its co-editor with Hans Walter Gabler) affirms that "a single, reconstructed, and eclectic text" may be the best "route" for the reader to take into the documents: "Through the one text," he says, "we can best understand the many." 71 Kelvin Everest, in another essay of 2000, has made a particularly eloquent and critically sophisticated statement of this position. Electronic archiving of a work's various documentary texts overlooks the need of readers to have guidance into the "constant core identity" of the work. This task requires the "editorial function," which is "an effort of scholarship " that "brings the history of a textual transmission to a specific textual focus for its period, and of its period." It "cannot abnegate the responsibility to shape an image of a body of texts. This editorial image is, indeed, at the heart of a living contemporary literary culture, because it is the coherent form in which a literary culture renews its understanding of the past." 72 A similar recognition of the need for critical texts was expressed the same year by Michael F. Suarez in one of the most balanced and effective essays 73 written in resistance to the "hype about hypertext" (p. 170). In pointing out the limitations of text-encoding as well as archiving, he brings us back—as good writing about electronic editions ought to bring us back—to the problems we have always had.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV There were of course many writings on textual matters in the last five or six years of the twentieth century that did not focus on nonverbal arts, or foreign traditions of editing, or computers. What these more general works did treat, however, was often not so different in essentials, for such questions as the ontology of verbal works, the role of authorial intention in editorial thinking, and the relative desirability of documentary and emended texts are basic to all textual discussion. Among the broader theoretical writings, there are some outstanding contributions, but there are also many pieces that accomplish little more than to repeat currently fashionable points in an uncritical way. A prime example of the latter category is W. Speed Hill's "Where Are the Bibliographers of Yesteryear?", which argues that analytical bibliography has become irrelevant to editing both because it cannot uncover printers' copy and because editors' attention has turned away from authorial intention. But the article's texture of unexamined clichés 74 disintegrates entirely when one remembers that the effort to learn as much as one can about the documents that transmit texts is a prima facie prerequisite to editing, regardless of the degree of certainty it attains in specific instances and regardless of the editorial goal one is working toward. Hill is one of several people who in recent years have attacked the so-called New Bibliography of Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg. What has put analytical bibliography out of favor (in spite of its focus on the materiality of documents) is that much of the earlier work was performed by scholars who believed (in the words of Joseph Loewenstein's essay mentioned below) that "textuality is . . . regulated by originative personhood." 75 One of the most critical treatments is Laurie E. Maguire's "The Rise of the New Bibliography," the second chapter (pp. 21-71) of her Shakespearean Suspect Texts: The "Bad" Quartos and Their Contexts (1996). She claims that "Sentimental, late-Victorian , land-owning imperialism influences much New Bibliographic analysis, leading to conclusions which are as outmoded as the historical circumstances which created them" (p. 59). But the "conclusions" she refers to are textual, and she does not show how physical analysis necessarily leads to those particular conclusions and thus does not present a criticism of "New Bibliographic analysis" itself. Maguire is also the coeditor (with Thomas L. Berger) of Textual Formations and Reformations (1998), an anthology that (in the words of her introduction) "stems from a reaction to the New Bibliography." 76 In its opening essay, " Authentic Reproductions: The Material Origins of the New Bibliography" (pp. 23-44), Joseph F. Loewenstein strains to show that "determining" factors for the "project" of the New Bibliography were "avarice, envy, perhaps anti-Semitism, certainly chauvinism, forgery, the hoarding instinct , and sound recording" (p. 23). 77 Analytical bibliography is also thoughtlessly criticized by several contributors to a "forum" organized by Susan Zimmerman for the 1996 volume of Shakespeare Studies ("Editing Early Modern Texts," 24: 1978) . The opening piece, Stephen Orgel's "What Is an Editor?" (pp. 2329) , contains a single paragraph (the third one) that is perhaps the densest concentration of misstatements about analytical bibliography that I have ever seen. He claims one of the "traditional assumptions of modern bibliography" to be the "idea that spelling and punctuation have no rules in the period, and are a function of the whim of the compositor " (an opinion that no analytical bibliographer has ever uttered) and that "there are elements of a text that are inessential or merely conventional ," which "don't affect the meaning and we can therefore safely change them" (an interpretation of Greg's "accidentals" that not only is incorrect but has nothing whatever to do with bibliography). A " subtext ," he says, is that "the printing process is transparent," so that we can see what lay behind it; and "a still deeper assumption" is that "the text itself is somehow independent of its material embodiment" (two unthinkable assertions for an analytical bibliographer to make). It is hard to believe that Orgel is so uninformed, and equally hard to believe that he is intentionally slanting his argument. Another of these brief essays, W. Speed Hill's "Where We Are and How We Got Here: Editing after Poststructuralism" (pp. 38-46), is full of his familiar bywords: he is content, for example, to repeat the nonsensical point that "the underlying idealism of authorial intention as an editorial goal was never wholly compatible with the rigorous materialism of the analytical bibliographer " (pp. 41-42)—a point I shall comment on later, if any comment is needed. In Zimmerman's "Afterword" (pp. 71-74), her reference to "the New Bibliographer's presumption that Shakespeare's intentions can be recuperated" and to "the idealism of the New Bibliography" (p. 72) point to a basic flaw in recent discussions: the failure to distinguish analytical bibliography from a particular editorial theory. 78 Although the New Bibliographers were interested in authorial intention, the essential insight they publicized (but did not fully originate) was that printing processes affect texts; attempting to find out what happened does not imply a particular editorial rationale or a disparagement of the study of book design and the post-production history of books. Failure to make this distinction vitiates numerous other discussions, such as Leah S. Marcus's in Unediting the Renaissance: Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Milton (1996). When Marcus says, for instance, that " Proponents of the New Bibliography . . . have tended to locate the `reality' of a given literary creation outside its extant material embodiments" (p. 29), or when she speaks (p. 30) of "the New Bibliography's insistence on ideal text and ideal copy" (whatever the latter is supposed to mean), she conflates under the term "New Bibliography" two distinct activities—analyzing physical evidence and deciding on an approach to editing . The harm resulting from this confusion is that analytical bibliography is effectively ignored, whereas it should be recognized as an essential tool for everyone, following any theory of literature, to employ in examining documents. Similarly, David Holdeman, in the opening pages of the introduction to his Much Laboring: The Texts and Authors of Yeats's First Modernist Books (1997), sees nothing wrong with saying that "much current editorial and bibliographical theory" challenges "the primacy of authorial intentions" as well as "the equally fundamental and traditional ontological assumptions that written texts are constituted only by language" (p. 4). But these ideas were not part of a previous "bibliographical theory," nor does current analytical bibliography challenge them (to say nothing of the fact that this summary does not do justice to the subtlety of the "editorial" theory it purports to describe). Holdeman repeats, without embarrassment, the notion that the " Greg-Bowers editorial theory . . . registers prevailing Romantic, modernist, and New Critical premises about the organic unity of literary works" (p. 2). 79 Philip Cohen has also been willing to recite certain familiar charges against what he sees as the Anglo-American tradition of "stabilizing the text" without examining them carefully. His "Textual Instability, Literary Studies, and Recent Developments in Textual Scholarship" 80 is promisingly titled but disappointingly superficial as an overview of the recent "paradigm shift in textual scholarship" (p. xiii). Intentionalist editing is linked with "the modernist quest for pure form" (p. xxiii), "the dream of a pure and organically unified form divorced from context or meaning," which has had "an especially seductive appeal for artists and critics alike ever since the Romantic period" (p. xxii). No thoughtful writer could utter these fallacious points so unabashedly, or could imagine that "traditional" editors ever believed in "the objective recuperability of authorial intention" (p. xxiii). The level of the piece is symbolized by its reference to the outmoded convention-paper topics of the past that are "duly recorded in the dusty volumes deposited in one's campus library" (p. xix). Although the theme of the essay—that textual instability affects literary interpretation—is important, it is not well served by being treated as a revelation antithetical to earlier editorial thinking. 81 Among the other writers who have often repeated such clichés without reflecting the scrutiny that those clichés had previously received is D. C. Greetham, one of the more prolific commentators on textual matters at the end of the twentieth century. In the eight years from 1992 through 1999, he published five books—an introductory textbook, a treatise on theory, a collection of his own essays, and two anthologies of essays by others. The most valuable of these is one of the anthologies, Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research (1995), a 740-page book in which specialists in various literatures summarize the history of editing in their fields. Nothing of the kind had been attempted before, and bringing this project to fruition required great effort on Greetham's part. He should be warmly thanked for his devotion to the cause; the result is extremely useful. 82 His other anthology, The Margins of the Text (1997), stems from his suspicion (expressed in his introduction) that there may have been "something patriarchal, elitist, even racist, about the very construction of the traditional scholarly edition." The book consists of fourteen essays, half devoted to "the function of discourses not previously recognized as significant to scholarly editing" (given certain attitudes toward "class, race, gender, and so on") 83 and half dealing with the significance of what appears in "the margins of the book" ("marginalia, commentary, and apparatus"). Greetham's own contribution, "The Resistance to Philology" (pp. 9-24), discusses, rather unproductively, "the current marginalized condition of textual study in the academy" (p. 10). 84 His textbook, Textual Scholarship: An Introduction (1992; reprinted with corrections and an expanded "Selected Bibliography" in 1994), heroically attempts to treat, in considerable detail, physical bibliography, codicology, and book-production history as well as the history and theory of editing works from all periods. He has generally done a creditable job of restating what is known, though one may quarrel with the relative allocation of space to various topics, given the introductory function of the book; and a charitable reader will be willing to excuse, in a work of such scope, the presence of passages that exhibit the author's lack of intimate knowledge of particular areas. (One of the problems posed by textbooks, of course, is that beginners will not know when they come across such passages.) 85 The collection of his essays, Textual Transgres- sions: Essays toward the Construction of a Biobibliography (1998), contains twenty-one pieces from a twenty-year period (1977-97), four of which had not previously been published. 86 In keeping with his subtitle, there is a biographical introduction, and each of the essays is placed in biographical context by prefatory remarks. These "interweaves," as he calls them, along with the introduction, may ultimately be regarded as the most useful parts of the book, for they form a substantial account (totaling 151 pages) of the professional world of textual criticism in the last quarter of the twentieth century, in the form of a memoir by an active participant. The remaining book is the one that I imagine Greetham regards as his most ambitious: Theories of the Text (1999), a very long work that has the broad aim of analyzing the various theoretical approaches that have been taken to texts in all genres and media. "My theories of the text," he says in the first paragraph of his introduction, "are thus theories of writing and of reading, theories of intention and of reception, theories of transmission and of corruption, and theories of originary conception and of social consumption and variation." The book, he adds, is "an account of the dialogics, pluralities, and contradictions that these multiple processes engender." One is willing to overlook the foreboding tinge of jargon here in order to welcome with enthusiasm the premise of an open-minded vade mecum to a complex set of interconnected attitudes . Any reader of the second page will have high expectations upon encountering Greetham's enlightened "contention that only by seeing the field whole can one begin to perceive the theory that is embedded in practice, those generally unacknowledged (because unseen) principles that drive both editorial and critical decisions." 87 I have always stated to my classes in textual criticism—as I assume other teachers of such classes have also done—that every editorial action implies a theoretical position, even though many editors have not consciously thought through their rationales. Therefore I was delighted to see Greetham say, "I will maintain throughout this book that all practice, even that which asserts its empirical independence from theory, is, in fact, empowered by a theory or theories." 88 The book, however, does not measure up to the expectations thus aroused, and many indications of the basic problems are already evident in its introduction, which is entitled "Textual Theory and the Territorial Metaphor." The prevalence of territorial boundaries in intellectual discussion is a relevant matter for Greetham to address because his goal is to show the implications, for textual criticism, of literary theories that have primarily been discussed by critics with no interest in or knowledge of textual criticism. He quite properly wishes to break down what he calls the "territorial fallacy": "the assumption that certain activities, even certain foundational concepts, were inherently `natural' or proper in certain parts of the academic or scholarly map" and not in others (p. 4). The barrier between what have usually been called "textual criticism" and "literary criticism" has of course developed some cracks in recent years, and anything that will cause it to crumble at a faster pace is to be encouraged. Greetham's book, however, turns out not to be such a thing, for in two extremely unfortunate ways he eschews the openness that one had supposed he was aiming for. One of the ways is symbolized by his insistence that he does not wish to help effect a marriage between fields as presently conceived; rather, his aim is to "co-opt" (a word he uses often) the language and approaches of literary theory, bringing them into "our own textual camp" (p. 5). In itself, the idea of showing that "theory" is not foreign to textual criticism is valuable; but to do so in a way that stresses only a one-way movement (a "co-option of the other disciplines" for use in "textual practice"), envisioning the relationship between "fields" as "cohabitation" rather than marriage (p. 6), only serves to reinforce boundaries. Should not those "other disciplines" import (if not co-opt) an understanding of textual transmission and its consequences? Are not the relationships reciprocal? What is wrong with the idea of a marriage? Greetham speaks of "the field of `text' " but it is "field," not "text," that I would put in quotation marks, for the study of texts—that is, "textual criticism," or the analysis of textual makeup and relationships—is not a field in the usual sense. If we think of fields as disciplinary units (such as sociology, philosophy, engineering, literature, and so on), they all use texts and therefore would benefit from approaching their texts with the insights and procedures that textual criticism, as well as literary criticism, have provided. Textual criticism is properly a part of every field, and only those persons with knowledge of the substantive content of a field (or subfield) are truly equipped to engage in the textual criticism of that field's (or subfield's) texts. One of the serious territorial problems in need of correction is the idea that textual criticism is an independent pursuit and that persons wishing to read the "content" of a work can simply leave the question of what the text ought to be (if they think of it at all) to textual scholars. Whereas Greetham recognizes that "theory" should not be considered to reside in one area rather than another, he fails to point out that "textual criticism" is an analogous activity in that it supports every field and finds its natural home in all of them. His concentration on taking "theory" from such places as literary criticism, psychology, and anthropology and putting it into textual criticism is actually a mixing—or at least a confusing—of his "territorial metaphor." To straighten it out would require that attention be given to moving textual criticism (with theory all compact, to be sure) into the multiplicity of disciplinary fields. The other way in which Greetham has failed to encourage the elimination of inhibiting boundaries is through limiting his purview to scholars rather than all readers, and indeed to textual scholars rather than all scholars. On his first page, he says he is dealing with theories that " encompass many of the current concerns of critical or literary theorists" but "always with a special focus on the force and meaning of text as it has been made phenomenologically available to use through the scholarly work of a long line of textual disseminators." On the next page he notes, "For well over two millennia, scholarly editors have been producing physical manifestations of various types of textuality." Near the end of his introduction, he states that his aim is "to illuminate the history and practice of textual scholarship" (p. 23). Why only "scholarly work" or "textual scholarship"? If, as Greetham believes and as is undoubtedly true, there is a theory or theories implicit in the practice of all scholarly editors, whether they recognize it or not, the same must perforce apply to all scholarly noneditors as well, and to all other editors and readers, however unscholarly they may be. It is by no means only scholarly editors who "have been producing physical manifestations of various types of textuality"; so have all the nonscholarly producers of anthologies, for example, or all the essayists who have ever quoted from or commented on other works. And why should we be concerned only with "physical manifestations"? All readers, whether or not they write anything down, struggle (sometimes consciously, sometimes not) with the competing and complementary concepts of textual significance that can be brought to every text. One might expect a book with the title Theories of the Text, a book aiming "to look at the field of `text' whole," to have encompassed all such instances of dealings with texts. By looking only at applications of theory to textual scholarship and at the controversies among scholarly editors, it cuts itself off from the ultimate purpose that all this activity is presumably directed toward, the fuller understanding of the meanings of texts. Unfortunately the sense that theory is a game, to be played for its own sake for the enjoyment of the thrusting and parrying, permeates the book. Greetham proceeds in a roughly chronological way to show "a cultural development from earlier formal and/or historical methods of analysis, via the language-based theories of structuralism and poststructuralism , and on to current considerations of society and gender" (p. 23), though he rightly insists that the book is not "either a history or a manual of practice." Instead it is a series of engagements with different concepts of human communication, in which each one is read "against the grain"—a favorite phrase that presumably means "critically" or "analytically" but which is revealing of Greetham's game-centered approach by suggesting confrontation and the hope of tripping up an opponent . These discussions do contain some astute observations on individual points, but they often contain questionable statements that undermine confidence in Greetham as a guide through the thickets of critical theory (despite his obvious acquaintance with a vast amount of material). For example, he sometimes seems to accept theorists' assertions without commenting on criticisms that have already been made of those assertions , and thus his account at such points lacks depth. One instance is his attribution to Jerome McGann of the idea (expressed in Greetham's words) that "the critical edition primarily empowers the linguistic not the bibliographical text" (p. 97). Even if we substitute "represents" for "empowers," the statement is still accusatory, and the ensuing discussion shows it was meant to be. Yet the criticism would carry greater weight if it took into account the reasons why the statement is not precisely accurate (facsimile editions can be critical) and why one might legitimately wish to focus on the "linguistic" text. Another instance is Greetham's assertion, following a discussion of "the essentialist and the physical positions " regarding textual ontology, that "literature cannot demonstrably be placed in one, and only one, of these classes" (p. 51). Why does he not comment on the concept of mixed media, which has been adduced to define combinations of language and visual effects in literature? Even if he does not find the concept helpful, his account is deficient if he does not bring specific arguments up to their present point and then try to move forward. A related class of problem involves the "paradoxes" and "ironies" that Greetham likes to point out—ones that sometimes prove to be merely glib and not in fact meaningful. Thus he finds a "dangerous paradox" in Betty T. Bennett's "Feminism and Editing Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley," an admirable essay that focuses (in Bennett's words) on "feminist criticism and its relationship to developing a theory of feminist editing." 89 "Such a distinction," Bennett sensibly says near the end, "is useful for purposes of inquiry, but is not meant to suggest that there should be a separate category of feminist editorial theory" (p. 90). Greetham believes that Bennett is thereby placed "in the awkward position of having to deny the validity of the very category in which her account of editing is produced" (p. 439); the resulting "paradox" is "the rejection of a category that informs the entire essay" (p. 440). The clauses that modify "category" in these two comments are remarkably imprecise. One could say that the possibility of a theory of feminist editing is the subject of Bennett's essay; but that of course means that feminist editing does not "inform" her essay in the sense of being a body of thought "in which" her essay is "produced." There is nothing more awkward or paradoxical in Bennett's essay than in any other instance where a writer examines a concept or position and raises doubts about it. 90 Greetham similarly (and as pointlessly) finds an "irony" reflected in many of Jerome McGann's writings that follow his A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983), for in them (according to Greetham) McGann "paradoxically" discusses misinterpretations of his social theory. What is supposedly paradoxical is that "McGann has to rescue his own authoriality and to disempower the reality of socialized reading in order to assert the Critique as a document disempowering authoriality and rescuing socialization" (p. 376). But it is absurd to suppose that McGann's theory requires authors either to accept the interpretations of their work put forward by others or else to keep quiet. McGann has never denied that authors have intentions and may wish on occasion to reassert them. Debates between writers and their critics are, after all, part of the social process, with intentions being expressed, and perhaps misunderstood, on both sides. To find an irony in McGann's efforts to clarify his intended meanings is to trivialize his whole approach. One more pointless "irony": There is some irony in this confluence of ontological idealism with a suspicion of physical nature, for while eclecticism appeals to authorial presence as the authority for textual reconstruction, it works with only the "traces" of this authority in concrete forms that are inevitably corrupt. (p. 40) If there is an irony here, then all efforts to reconstruct the past are ironic. We constantly use tangible clues, found in documents and other physical objects, as sources for attempting to recover past occurrences and states of mind. Greetham's pretentious statement (or, one could argue, misstatement) tries to manufacture an irony where none exists. These are only a few examples, but I think revealing ones, of the tone and effects produced by the book's gamesmanship. 91 I shall look at one more passage, even though it deals with an essay of mine. (It is not my business here to comment on Greetham's many observations regarding my writings; but this passage is worth examining anyway for what it indicates about his approach.) Greetham believes that, in my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" ( Studies in Bibliography, 1991), my "questioning their [the social textual critics'] intellectual and rhetorical ability to carry out their own project" is a "deft manœuvre" (p. 399). Although I have never regarded anything I have done in an essay as a "manœuvre," my assertion on this score is irrelevant. The point is that, if a commentator on an essay (by anyone) assumes that the author is merely engaged in a tactical campaign to win a skirmish, the commentator is revealing a very superficial view of the nature of intellectual exchange. There are serious matters of substance to be talked about, but one would never know it from this way of proceeding. Greetham then goes on to say that my attempt "to `salvage' by co-option" (referring to my belief that the intentionalist and the social approaches are complementary, focusing on different parts of the full picture) is "a near-perfect example of the Kuhnian paradigm shift in operation," comparable to the " accommodations " made by the "Ptolemaic paradigm" when confronted with the "Copernican account of a heliocentric solar system" (p. 401). If Greetham really believed that this were an apt analogy, he would be revealing a failure to understand what movements and trends in literary criticism signify. But that cannot be the explanation. Instead, his use of this comparison seems to be an indication of how unwilling he is to present the intentionalist approach in an open-minded way. Despite the seeming balance of his ensuing discussion, where he does not question "the competence or comprehensiveness of either theory," 92 this sentence has the effect of planting in his readers' minds the notion that the intentionalist approach is (or will be) as dead as an earth-centered view of the universe. I am not charging him with a "manœuvre" but simply noting how his language appears to reveal a less than open frame of mind. A word must be said about the style in which the book is written, if only because Greetham makes an issue of it at the end of his introduction , where he notes that his prose has been described as " `not for the faint-hearted.' " This point will strike a chord with his readers, who will have read the following sentence a few pages earlier: Danto's depiction of a "fertile" vocabulary from philosophy ("dialogues, lecture notes, fragments, poems, examinations, essays, aphorisms, meditations, discourses", etc. (7)) having constructed the very generic identities through which literature is discussed would seem to counter Rorty's and Eagleton's rhetorical histories, except that, writing from within the concerns of analytical philosophy (and thus regarding the Referential Fallacy of literature as a real liability rather than as simply a necessary pose to ensure that there is "nothing outside the text" (see below, 359)), Danto's assumption that he has uniformly separated the tenor and vehicle in his list of "philosophical" genremarkers and that he can determine the direction of the influence in "what looks like a metaphor" must remain simply that—an assumption. (p. 16) This sentence is somewhat longer than average, but the effect it creates is the same as that found in many passages where the individual sentences happen to be shorter. Greetham explains that "much of the terminology and argument of recent critical discourse does demand a denseness of reference and a reach into obscure (that is, `new and strange') speaking." A benefit, in his view, is "that the reader must slow down, must be given pause and reflection." There is a difference, of course, between having to slow down in order to reflect on profound ideas and having to pause just to disentangle the prose. But leaving that point aside, one must ask why the "obscure speaking" of theorists needs to be replicated in a discussion of those theorists. Greetham seems to take for granted that such imitation is desirable, citing "classical decorum, a style suited to its subject": "there are many subjects and thus [note the connective] many styles included in the wide coverage of this book" (p. 25). The most extreme example is his chapter on deconstruction, which consists of a series of "Notes" to an "absent" text (an essay of his in the 1991 Studies in Bibliography ), followed by a section of "Notes to Notes," which are themselves heavily footnoted. He admits that the result is "probably somewhere between imitation and parody" (p. 327). Although parody can, in skillful hands, be an incisive form of criticism, it more often (as here) seems self-indulgently sophomoric . Greetham labels his method in the "absent" text "a playful teasing out," a "Derridean jeu " (p. 326), and the same could be said of this chapter—and indeed, in one degree or another, of all the other chapters. They all seem to be the playing out of a game, though the cumulative effect of the constant allusions (to writers who have said something related to whatever point is at hand) is comic rather than playful. In reading this book, one scarcely gets a sense that texts exist for any reason other than to provide material for contentious theorists to argue about. It is regrettable that a book on such an important subject, written by a person with such broad knowledge of critical theory, should turn out this way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V In a field where there is so much turgid writing that mindlessly repeats fashionable views, one gratefully turns to Peter L. Shillingsburg's Resisting Texts: Authorship and Submission in Constructions of Meaning (1997), a book of subtlety, insight, and balance, written in lucid, jargon-free, and often forceful prose. No one who knows his earlier writings will be surprised by the quality of this book, for with Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age and numerous essays he has established himself as a force for coherence and good sense in the discordant world of textual criticism. Indeed, some of those earlier essays—including one of the best known, "Text as Matter, Concept, and Action"—are reused, in revised form, in the book. Out of nine chapters, six had previously appeared, between 1989 and 1996, and their collection here is welcome, not only because they deserve to be available in this convenient form but also because they contribute effectively to the point of view that the book as a whole maintains. 93 That position is made clear in the (previously unpublished) introduction , indicatively entitled "Is There Anything to `Get Straight'?" He begins with an exemplary discussion of the role of history in literary criticism, of the reasons for being interested in both "historically intended meanings and present operative meanings" (p. 8), keeping in mind the impossibility of certitude in recovering the past. Then he turns to the real underpinning of the book, reflected in his statement, "Frankly, I do not hold that there is a superior view of textuality" (p. 10). Unlike so many writers in the field, he is not a partisan of one theory, hoping to discredit other approaches. Rather, he wishes "to understand and describe the principles governing the workings of a range of textual engagements" (p. 9). The word "understand" occurs several times in his declarations of the goal of the book: he is open to all our dealings with texts ("why and how we resist texts and why and how they resist us" [p. 10]) and simply wants to understand all "textual engagements ." Only one theory ultimately matters to him—a theory that encompasses all our interactions with written (that is, material) texts. What he sets out to construct is a "theory of script acts," a term he coins for its parallelism with "speech-act theory." It may not be the best term for his purpose, however, because "script act" suggests an exclusive concern with production (by author, publisher, and so on)—or, if readers' responses are included, the implication would seem to be that readers are concerned only as parties to a communicative transaction. Shillingsburg acknowledges that most of his book relates to "communicative acts," but he adds that "readers might with perfect right refuse to care what communicative intention an author might have actually had or professed to have had" (p. 12). Since it was "a desire to understand how these reactions [the one just mentioned among others] come about that impelled this work," an emphasis on communication may not form a sufficiently broad base for what Shillingsburg has in mind. 94 That this question arises is a slight defect in the introduction, but it is overshadowed by the laudable general attitude set forth toward textual study. The first chapter, one of the three previously unpublished ones, deals (as its title, "The Hand from the Grave," suggests) with authorial intention , especially the editorial problem of reporting multiple or successive intentions. The opening and closing of the chapter provide worthwhile reading on this vexed subject, but the middle part is less satisfactory. After proclaiming it "a condition of the print medium that one text be in the foreground and alternatives be in some permanently subordinate position," he declares, "If no one has already announced the death of the editor as the conceptual authority over what the text says, I announce it here" (p. 18). The half-page that separates these two statements does not explain how one moves from the first (which places the blame on "the print medium") to the second (where the editor is responsible : Shillingsburg even adds, "The fact the print medium gives us no choice but to act as we do is no excuse"). One might conceivably say that the limitations of the codex form have given the editor a de facto authority (though even this is too strong, as we shall see in a moment), but certainly not "conceptual authority." 95 There is of course nothing wrong with an editor's carrying some authority, by virtue of being an expert on the author's writing habits and style and on the textual history of the work. But such experts do not usually believe that they have " conceptual authority over what the text says": it is hard to imagine an editor of a codex edition with apparatus who does not hope that readers will examine the variants and evaluate the readings present in the main text. That few readers will actually do so is hardly the editor's fault—a point that Shillingsburg (rather confusingly in the context) seems to agree with, for he proceeds to say, "As a matter of fact, however, my quarrel is not with editors but with users of scholarly editions" (p. 19). He speaks of their "naive reliance on editors," their "blind faith": thus perhaps editors have had their authority thrust upon them. One must infer, if readers can be considered remiss in their use of codex editions, that such editions are usable—that it is possible for readers not to be so awed by the full presentation of one text that they fail to consider the readings from other texts recorded in the apparatus. What, then, is Shillingsburg finally saying? 96 In Chapter 4 ("Texts, Cultures, Mediums, and Performances: The French Lieutenant's Woman, " pp. 105-119), the next of the new chapters , there is no doubt about what he is saying. He uses the Fowles novel to illustrate the complexity of the act of communication set in motion by a literary work, focusing on "the temporal, history-bound `eventness' of text production and text reception as communicative acts" (p. 112); and he concludes (in the final sentence) that "having off the past as irrelevant or unnecessary because it is inaccessible represents a radical ` presentism ,' which is reductive and intellectually impoverishing." The main point here is unambiguous and important—so important as to deserve a better expression, not encumbered with an illogical summary of the opposing position. Some people do indeed feel that the past is irrelevant or unnecessary, but that feeling is independent of whether or not the past is inaccessible; others believe that the inaccessibility of the past is reason enough not to bother with it. But its inaccessibility cannot logically cause one to find it irrelevant or unnecessary. And of course there is an element of circularity in the conclusion, since one could say that a neglect of the past is impoverishing to those who find a knowledge of the past enriching in the first place. My own way of paraphrasing what I take to be his point would be as follows: if we assume as axiomatic that any increase in awareness is enriching, then a knowledge of historical contexts—as part of the mental framework one brings to a literary work— enlarges one's sense of possessing the work in the present, whether or not one is interested in the past for its own sake; and the fact that the past is not fully available to us provides no reason for declining to push our understanding of it as far as we can, just as we do with every other intellectual pursuit (none of which can ever be completed). This point of view is of course not new, but Shillingsburg's effective use of the Fowles novel to illustrate it gives it added force. The third of the previously unpublished chapters, "Individual and Collective Voices: Agency in Texts" (Chapter 6, pp. 151-164), is central to Shillingsburg's position, for it focuses on how "to integrate insights of the intentionalist and materialist `schools of editing' " (p. 157). He rightly deplores the "combative spirit" with which champions of the latter have insisted on "the `new' at the expense of the `old' " (p. 153), resulting in polarized thinking that lacks the subtlety required by the subject; indeed, the potential contribution of the new insight is undermined by simply supplanting "the authorial voice with the production voice" (p. 154). Instead, Shillingsburg stresses the importance of paying attention to the "multiple voices" present in every work. Each voice reflects agency or intentionality, and Shillingsburg repeatedly makes a point not often enough recognized: that "the social contract as a `school of editing' has not done away with agency for authority, it has not done away with personal responsibility for textual variation, it has not done away with intentionality, and it has not done away with the author" (pp. 163-164). This welcome emphasis on multiple agency nevertheless slights one matter: the legitimate interest people may have in the product that readers of the past had in front of them, however full it was of features not intended by anyone. Shillingsburg's lack of attention to this matter makes the end of his chapter less precise than it should have been. When he says that editorial theory of thirty years ago "defined the problem too narrowly," he apparently means that it did not take the social construction of texts into account. I believe, however, that the narrowness of earlier theory is to be defined somewhat differently: its limitation lay not in ignoring the social side of text production altogether but in assuming that facsimiles took sufficient account of it, thus neglecting the intentions of publishers and other involved persons aside from the author . And these intentions are still generally neglected—which brings me to the same conclusion as Shillingsburg's, though by a different route. Recognizing that the social approach to literature involves two foci, production and reception (the first involving intention, the second concentrating on whatever the artifact displays), would make Shillingsburg's discussion even more effective than it already is. 97 The concluding chapter, largely published in a periodical in 1996, 98 sums up Shillingsburg's inclusive position under the rubric "A Whirlwind of Possibilities" (a rather odd choice of title, since it suggests chaos rather than the order that Shillingsburg has in fact brought to the subject) . After discussing briefly the two basic approaches to editing (accepting documentary texts and reconstructing intended texts), he gives a succinct historical account of twentieth-century editorial theory. It has the great merit (despite some imprecise, even erroneous, statements) 99 of calling particular attention to the fallacy inherent in the idea of promoting a new view by discrediting earlier ones; as he sarcastically adds, "when the task is to make room for a new paradigm, it is, of course, counterproductive to be fair" (p. 213). Then he explains his own position : that there is "a significant distinction to be made between [verbal] works and physical representations of them," but that there is no " essential or `extant' conceptual or performance work that is the real work"; rather, "physical copies . . . point to and result from" the "human existential condition" to which works are intricately connected (p. 219). Documentary texts are "potluck texts," and most readers prefer to approach texts as "agent dependent" (p. 221). Thus critical editing is essential (along with the publishing of documentary texts), and multiple critical texts of a work are required to reflect the voices of different "authorizing agents" (p. 222). He ends with a tribute to the "courage, criticism, intelligence, and humility" of editors who alter documentary texts in order to produce texts that represent "integrity of voice or agency"—each such product being "only another recipe for the work" (pp. 224-225). None of this is new (and Shillingsburg would not claim otherwise), but it is a point of view often drowned out in contemporary debate. Having it set forth so ably is therefore a great benefit—and all the more so because it offers, I believe, the most constructive direction for editorial theory to take. Shillingsburg's book can be enthusiastically admitted to the small shelf of essential works in this field. Since the publication of his book, he has continued to drive home his position in forceful essays. In the 1999 Editio anthology, 100 for example, he meditates on "losses"—especially the losses involved in accepting only one editorial approach and rejecting alternative ones. Those who "ride the cusp of the newest enthusiasm" (p. 2) often "attack the old in order to make room for the new" (p. 4); but earlier editions that did well what they set out to do should not be considered failures "just because the purpose for which they were designed is no longer the ruling fad" (p. 6). And in another piece the same year, called "Editing Determinate Material Texts" ( Text, 12: 59-71), he criticizes Norman Feltes's belief in a Marxist "determinate material practice" to explain Victorian book production, pointing out that its reduction of authors and publishers to "simple, practically helpless, operatives in a determinate world" (p. 65) is analogous to the position of the social-contract textual critics. From there on, we are in familiar territory, though the piece contains some of Shillingsburg's most emphatic statements. Reflecting on the continuing relevance of "individual action, desire, and intention," he declares, "I do not find persuasive or helpful the notion that publication grants viability to works which, as long as they remain in manuscript, are unfinished or unborn," and he vows that he "will go on harping on that string till times change" (p. 68). Times will indeed change, as they always do, and it will then seem strange that his harping was needed; but in the present he is a welcome presence, persistently showing the rationality of accepting multiple approaches. Another frequent commentator on textual matters, Paul Eggert, shares certain ideas with Shillingsburg, such as the permanent value of the concept of authorship and the recognition that different viewpoints can be complementary, not mutually exclusive. In a 1993 conference paper that he included, in revised form, in the 1998 anthology that he and Margaret Sankey edited, he proposes a way of "bridging the divide" between "social discourse" and "authorial agency." 101 He suggests that we distinguish between "the level of document" (the "level of physical inscription") and "the level of text" ("the meaning" created by both the producers and the receivers of documents [pp. 103-104]). This formulation , in his view, bridges the gap by recognizing, first, that "the historicity of the document records both the authorial agency and other contributing agencies" and, second, that "their textual work [their creation of meaning] will inevitably have been moulded by, even as to varying degrees it moulded, the discursive pressures of their period" (p. 111). Thinking in this way is indeed helpful, though it is not as different as Eggert may believe from the more traditional distinction between the tangible "texts of documents" and the intangible "texts of works" (indeed , I think he could have avoided some awkwardness by using the word "work" instead of "text" for his second level). His central point, as I see it, could be summarized this way: just as the physical features of documents (including arrangements of words and punctuation) bear testimony both to authorial striving and to social conditions, so the works that can be created from documents run the gamut from those created by authors and other participants in the process of documentary production to those created by readers and editors (with their varying temperaments and backgrounds). The slight shift in emphasis here (as I would express it) from the more conventional approach is a welcome one: that all editorial work, including that devoted to documentary editions, is—like all other acts of reading—a construction of meaning, which may or may not have a historical orientation; when editors publish their work, they are simply offering new documents that can serve in their turn as the grounding for further creations of meaning. Eggert's essay, besides providing a shrewd criticism of Foucault and Derrida, 102 cogently shows the fallacy of believing that the "real story starts . . . at the reader-discursive level" rather than at "the initiating point of the production of meaning which is indisputably witnessed by the documents " (p. 111), by "the documentary record's having taken the particular form it did and no other" and thus testifying to the work of particular human agents (p. 112). This point is at the heart of another paper of his written for a conference one year later than the one just discussed, and published in revised form in anthologies of 1995 and 1999. 103 Its title includes a pair of phrases—"historical version" and "authorial agency"—that are nearly identical with those in the earlier piece, and he sets as his task the formulation of "editing principles capable of holding [these] two strands in complementary balance" (p. 51). The key, as we know from the previous essay, is recognizing acts of individual agency in the physical features of documents: "what is irrefutable is that the physical inscriber—the individual textual agent—enters into the business of textuality" (p. 57). Examination of the drama physically enshrined in documents leads to the observation that "documentary texts [are] inherently unstable" (p. 55)—an unexceptionable point relevant to his argument, though he improperly and unnecessarily makes it a criticism of the traditional intentionalist approach. 104 As editor of the Academy Editions of Australian Literature (on which he draws in this essay), Eggert puts into practice his principle of respecting both document and agent by allowing the specific rationale for dealing with each work to grow out of its particular textual history. This openness to alternatives is admirable, but there is inevitably a compromise involved if one approach is given precedence in each case—which is why he suggests the usefulness of supplementing the printed volumes of the Academy Editions with electronic texts (p. 56). Even if his conclusion remains vague on a practical level, he has made a contribution to theoretical discussion by emphasizing , in a distinctive way, how documents link us as much to personal agents as to social forces. 105 T. H. Howard-Hill has also challenged some of the ideas of the adherents of the social approach to textual criticism. 106 Although he claims only to offer "general characterizations" of their attitudes, not rebuttals of them or reassertions of "the values of the `traditional' editing" (p. 58), he concludes that "their arguments lead nowhere any editor should wish to follow" (p. 62); and the force of his observations is weakened by what appears at times to be a lack of open-mindedness. Nevertheless, he makes some arresting points worth noting, beginning with his view of the social theorists' work "less as innovative than reactionary" (p. 51). These adjectives are of course not necessarily opposites, and I would rather say that this body of thought is both innovative and reactionary. In any case, its reactionary aspects are rarely remarked on; yet it clearly is a variety of the general tendency regarded as conservative in editorial tradition: the distrust of editorial intervention in documentary texts. To call the social theorists conservative is not to criticize them, however, but only to recognize where their thought falls in the cyclical movements that constitute the history of editorial theory. Similarly, Howard-Hill's three "characterizations" of their thinking are valid, but one cannot feel very satisfied with the associated discussion unless some adjustments are made. First, he remarks on these scholars ' "antiquarianism" (a term that I do not consider pejorative, and I assume Howard-Hill does not, either); all this means is that they respect historical evidence. But when he says that these scholars believe documentary texts to be relatively "unmediated witnesses to the creative processes and achievements of their originators" (p. 58), he ignores a major reason for the interest in "unmediated" texts: their value as a record of what readers had in front of them. And then when he says that the "vehemence" of these scholars' arguments "establishes original or facsimile editions as the only kind of edition that they value," he misses the opportunity to point out that such editions are in fact most appropriate for accommodating that unstated reason for valuing documents, not for appreciating "creative processes and achievements," which are best approached through critical texts. The second characteristic of the social theorists, he says, is that they are "all hostile to the New Bibliography "; but to add (correctly) that the New Bibliography is "the single most important advance in the development of Anglo-American editing" (p. 59) is hardly to the point, since that fact accounts in large part for their hostility in the first place. The point that needs to be made here is that analytical bibliography supports every approach to editing and indeed, with its focus on physical details, should be seen as a corollary to "antiquarianism." The third characteristic named by Howard-Hill is that "these scholars reject interpretation as part of the editorial function ." Although it is relevant to note that such resistance is futile ("editors can scarcely refrain from an activity so pervasively human"), the more constructive point is that interpretation emerging out of specialist knowledge is essential to the growth of human understanding. Howard-Hill's essay makes many useful points about the nature of the social theorists' position; what it lacks is a clear indication that their thinking is an important contribution to a comprehensive view of the range of editorial approaches necessary for the study of every work. When he says that their emphasis on facsimiles is a "dead end" (p. 61), his overly negative tone masks what I believe is his real meaning: that the reproduction of documentary texts is a dead end only if editing is limited to that activity and nothing else. This is the basic point that should have surfaced in his piece much more than it does: the social theorists' position is objectionable only to the extent that it denies the validity of other approaches. Howard-Hill is perhaps reaching toward this point when he says, quite correctly, that Greg, McKerrow, and Bowers "were pluralists to an extent that some more modern editors and theorists are not prepared either to acknowledge or to emulate" (p. 62). If the implications of this statement had been amplified through the essay, which would then have shown more clearly how critical and documentary editions are complementary, Howard-Hill would still have accomplished his purpose of characterizing the social approach, but in a more helpful way. 107 I should like to mention here, at the end of this survey, my 1998 collection , Literature and Artifacts —not because it is by me, but because it includes my 1994 essay "Editing without a Copy-Text" (pp. 236-257), which forms an appropriate pairing with Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," published at the beginning of the half-century. Indeed, I conceived of the essay as a replacement for Greg-not in a spirit of rejection but of completion. Greg's essay does not carry to a logical conclusion the idea that critical editing relies on editors' judgments, for by recommending the adoption of a copy-texst with presumptive authority it retains an element of the best-text approach (which Greg was attempting to move away from). It was my object to show, first, that editions offering critical texts will always be of value, alongside documentary editions, and, second, that a critical text should be a constructed text rather than an emended one. In other words, editors should not be thinking in terms of altering a particular existing text but of building up a new text, word by word and punctuation mark by punctuation mark, evaluating all available evidence at each step. The text that one would otherwise have chosen as copy-text would no doubt still often carry the most evidentiary weight as one decides on individual readings (so long, of course, as one had the same goal in mind). But the psychology of editing would be different because every element of the critical text would be the result of a positive action (in support of some goal, not necessarily final authorial intention); none would be the product of the passive notion of "retaining" something. Whether I made this case effectively is not for me to say, but I believe this shift in thinking is necessary to fulfill the underlying logic of critical editing. Greg's mid-century essay reverberated in many ways through the ensuing half-century, but only at the end of that period was it seen as a stepping-stone to a coherent concept of the role of judgment in critical editing. 108</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI Reading through the writing on textual criticism and scholarly editing that has been published in the final years of the twentieth century is a rather dispiriting experience, with few bright spots, because so much of it is not only inexcusably jargon-filled but also needlessly scornful of previous thinking. That a lot has been written would be a good sign only if it translated into a substantial increase in understanding. But much of the commentary has followed a pattern all too common in intellectual discourse: it repeats points that are currently in vogue and attacks what went before, without meeting counterarguments that have already been expressed. It proceeds in a fashion aptly described by a marvelously compact phrase of Adam Michnik's, "mantra rather than discourse." 109 Thinking will not move forward unless counterarguments are addressed, so that a more comprehensive, more broadly perceptive, statement can be made. The reason that this process has not occurred more often is that a great many people are not interested in conversation, in dialogue: they wish to enforce their own points of view, and they simply do not listen to possible objections to their arguments and go right on saying what they said in the first place, as if no other observations had been made in the meantime. The most noticeable recent illustration of this phenomenon in textual criticism involves some of the scholars who wish to be associated with the idea that texts are socially constructed. They believe that they can support their position by criticizing authorial intention as an editorial goal (and analytical bibliography because it was developed by scholars who held that goal); and they persist in making the same criticisms, even though inaccuracies in those criticisms have been noted and—more importantly—even though the logical fallacy of promoting one emphasis by denigrating another has been pointed out. 110 Even if the criticisms of authorial intention were sound, the validity of the social approach would not thereby be confirmed. It should be obvious, however, that both approaches are valid and that both are indeed necessary to understand the entire history of works, from their initial creation to the unending sequence of public responses to them. The recent attention to the postproduction part of this history has indeed clarified and enriched the study of documentary texts and their physical embodiments, and we should be delighted by it. But there is no reason why such study must be pursued at the expense of the other part of the story. Those who have taken an either/or position, suggesting that an interest in authorial intention is futile, unproductive, and outmoded, have shown by their manner of proceeding that they are more concerned with promoting a particular point of view than with welcoming all approaches that can contribute to fuller understanding. They, like so many people in all walks of life, think in terms of winning an argument rather than of participating in a conversation. A wonderful phrase of Jeffrey M. Perl's comes to mind in this connection: in the Winter 2002 number of his journal Common Knowledge (8: 1-6), he entitled the opening piece "Civilian Scholarship." If scholarship, or any other discourse, is civilian rather than military, then it is founded on "metaphors of conversation or friendship rather than on metaphors adopted from those of sports and war, of `sides' that one must `take' " (p. 5). Referring to such common beliefs as that "strife is productive" or that quarreling is a game, Perl says, "The world deserves better of those employed to think and write and educate." One of the best expressions of this general view comes from an essay of Gordon N. Ray's called "Books as a Way of Life": I should not forget to mention that book-educated people of the sort I have been describing are rarely dogmatic. They tend instead to regard the world from what George Eliot in Daniel Deronda whimsically calls "a liberalmenagerie point of view." This state of mind infuriates the fierce partisan, but it enlivens social intercourse, and it holds out hope for the glorious day when mankind will cure itself of the plague of politics. The "literature of power" is above politics, having understanding as its aim rather than victory, and the books that embody it are thus a potentially unifying force in a divided world. 111 Understanding rather than victory: this is the motto for civilian scholarship . It is a motto negated by a large number of recent writings on textual and editorial theory. We need not worry, however, as long as writers of the caliber of Grigely and Shillingsburg come along. And as a way of identifying hopeful signs for the twenty-first century, I shall mention two publications of its earliest years. The first is a superb essay by Phillip Harth, written as a review of the first two volumes of Paul Hammond's Longman edition of Dryden. 112 This edition is partially modernized, and Harth devotes most of his essay to demonstrating, with great patience and clarity, the folly of spending time on a task that is not only impossible to carry out satisfactorily but also counterproductive, since the results, far from assisting the reader, form a barrier to understanding. After demolishing the often-repeated notion that the spelling and punctuation of sixteenthand seventeenth-century editions necessarily reflect compositorial practice more than authorial preference, Harth shows how Hammond's "concern to expunge all signs of the compositor's intervention results inevitably in the omission of prosodic, figurative, and stylistic elements for which the poet himself was responsible" (p. 241). Since Hammond does not modernize any quotations (from Dryden or anyone else) in his annotations, Harth is given the opportunity to make a basic point applicable to all modernization: "readers will quickly adjust to the unfamiliar appearance of those excerpts and experience little difficulty in reading and understanding them. They will want to do so, in fact, as they find themselves drawn more and more into observing the process of historical recovery" (p. 244). These readers will then, of course, "come to wonder why an exception was thought to be necessary" for the main text. Harth's essay is one of the best discussions of modernization we have ever had; it should be pondered not merely by all editors but by all readers. The other twenty-first-century publication that I want to mention is David Scott Kastan's Shakespeare and the Book (2001), which illustrates not only the lingering power of certain clichés but also, more importantly , the way in which an open-minded intelligence will see through and beyond them. The book is an engagingly written and perceptive account of Shakespeare in print—the literary Shakespeare that emerged through the editions of his work over the centuries rather than the Shakespeare of the theater (which is apparently all he aspired to be). Although the book is not, in one sense, primarily about textual theory, the basic issues that textual criticism must come to terms with pervade the book and are, from time to time, its explicit subject. If one were to read only the introduction, one would think that Kastan is another of those writers who repeat trendy clichés unquestioningly. Beginning with the assertion that he is dealing with a "hot topic," 113 he states that he is "deeply suspicious" of the brand of editorial theory that "posits as its object of desire a work that never was, an ideal text of an author's intentions that no materialization does (or can) bear witness to" (p. 3). He believes that a concept of the work as intangible denies the work of "any effective principle of realization," and he adds, "Only as texts are realized materially are they accessible" (p. 4). The familiar arguments about the role of the physical in reading and about the collaborative nature of drama are repeated, but they lead him to a point not commonly made: that the printed text of a play, even one based on performance, has "its own compelling logic," and thus offers a different work from that of the performance. The point is valuable, though it takes him to treacherous ground: "Text and performance are, then, not partial and congruent aspects of some unity that we think of as the play, but are two discrete modes of production" (p. 9). Giving the printed play-text autonomy from the stage as well as from authorial intention obviously serves to justify his focus on the book as a social product. His introduction unfortunately does not do justice to the more thoughtful view that emerges in the chapters that follow (although there is a slight hint in his unexplained admission that the concept of work as the author's "unrealized intentions" is "not without value" [p. 4]). In the final chapter he recognizes the value of all kinds of editions. A goal of reconstructing an "authorial text," he says, is "a reasonable but by no means necessary grant of authority to the intended text over the actual textual forms in which it is encountered"; "the author's intentions are of course a worthy, if elusive, object of study," and to pursue them "the conventional understanding and practices of editing are appropriate ." But "there must be alternative ways to conceive of the goals of editorial activity, ways in which the processes of materialization would not be understood as unwanted obstacles" (p. 122). These comments reflect an admirably comprehensive view of editing, a recognition that no one approach can adequately accommodate the differing kinds of interest we may have in every work. One may wonder how Kastan can end on a note so different from the way he started: the introduction, not the conclusion, is in fact the anomaly, for the book as a whole displays a broader understanding than his willingness to repeat stock phrases (and not only in the introduction) suggests. For example, the cliché that we are "heirs of a romantic conception of writing as individual and originary" (p. 48), is immediately followed by the recognition that some of Shakespeare's contemporaries held the same conception; and Kastan's treatment of Shakespeare's eighteenth-century editors, who strove to produce intended texts, is not condemnatory but rather accepting of their efforts as a manifestation of one of the interests that people do have. 114 I should like to use these contradictory elements in Kastan's work as a way of summarizing two basic points about the nature of texts and of editing. First is his idea that "literature exists, in any useful sense, only and always in its materializations." The phrase "in any useful sense" is there because Kastan understands that "the work of the imagination" precedes its materialization in "a medium that is incommensurate with its refinement." Presumably for this reason he calls the concept of immaterial works "not logically impossible" (p. 4). But it cannot then be ignored on the grounds that a work, so conceived, depends on "physical supports" if readers are to experience it. Obviously an intangible verbal work can be transmitted only in oral or visible form, and every attempt to recover the author's original and later intentions must itself be given one of these two forms if it is to be communicated; but the attempt to reconstruct intentions, however mediated by editorial judgment and its presentation, is no different in kind from all other efforts to recover past events that are not directly available in living oral traditions or surviving physical objects. Clearly every oral rendition and every printed text of what purports to be the same work produces a discrete experience, and each one is deserving of our serious attention. That an intangible intended work or series of works (versions) underlies such manifestations is also evident, as Kastan implicitly recognizes at various points. He notes, for instance, "the difference in the material relation of painters to their paintings and authors to the books that bear their names" (pp. 115-116). And despite his having complained at the beginning of his book about the idea that works "have a reality independent of the physical [or, one might add, oral] texts in which we engage them" (p. 3), he says at the end that Hamlet is "the name for what allows us comfortably to consider as some metaphysical unity the various instantiations of the play" (p. 133). This unity need not be a single text, of course, and he is right to say immediately that he is not referring to "some pre-representational original." Although he is speaking of a pattern that somehow connects all versions, he has nevertheless shown that we cannot do without the concept of intangible media (otherwise texts and performances would not be " instantiations " of something else)—and thus there must also be intended texts that antedate their instantiations. The other point I wish to take up is what implications for editing follow from an acceptance of the importance of all texts—intended, recited , and tangible. The first question is whether there should be any editing whatever (in the sense of critical editing, which is what Kastan generally means by "editing"). Most discussions that propose as an editorial goal "the location of the text within the network of social and institutional practices" (p. 122)—and Kastan's is no exception—suggest that "arguably it becomes more difficult to justify editing at all." What is usually not made clear is that facsimiles serve only one aspect of the social approach to texts: they show what actually emerged from the publication process. An interest in the publisher's intention (or that of other collaborators with the author), however, requires a critically emended text, just as an interest in the author's intention does. 115 Although Kastan does not make this point explicitly, he understands some of the reasons for having "many kinds of editions," those that "attempt to restore the play he [Shakespeare] wrote before it was subjected to the demands of production in both the playhouse and the printing house" 116 as well as those that "take the theatrical auspices [and presumably the printinghouse demands] of the plays seriously" (p. 123), including facsimiles. But this laudable inclusiveness is marred by his statement that, although there are "good reasons . . . for many kinds of editions," there are " probably not very good reasons for as many of the same kinds of editions as indeed we have." This statement can make sense only if one takes it as flippant, in the same way one would regard the observation that there are too many books about Hamlet. It is only a way of expressing a personal preference for one approach, or one set of judgments, over another. There can never be too many editions of any work because each one is part of the unending process of responding to the work. Kastan actually does understand this point: each edition, like each performance, of a play becomes part of a cumulative history of what has been experienced as the play; and the more of this history that is available the more it becomes possible to measure the play's achievement and its effects. (p. 124) 117 I hope my comments show how Kastan's book stands apart from the usual arguments for equating literature with material texts. Kastan seems on one level to want to accept the standard clichés, but his basic good sense forces its way to the surface and will not allow that to happen unequivocally . This struggle results in some contradictions, but it strengthens his account and is a hopeful sign for the future. That there will never be an end to the re-editing of texts and the publication of new editions, no matter how many times those texts have been edited before, is a fact of life that Tom Davis, for one, would perfectly understand. In his refreshing, clear-headed, and witty piece called "The Monsters and the Textual Critics" 118 —an essay that ought to be known by everyone who takes reading seriously—he recognizes that textual criticism is in fact something practiced by everyone all the time. Textual criticism, whether of verbal texts or of any other part of our surroundings, is "impossible" in the sense that it can rarely result in certain answers; but it is "necessary" and therefore "universal." Those who edit texts should not lose sight of the combination of science and art involved. Like scientists who "run up all the time against the intransigence of nature" (p. 110), editors will come to dead ends in their research but still—by other means, those of literary criticism—must offer possible solutions to problems that are basically insoluble. If editors openly accept, and clearly express, the limitations inherent in their work, then textual criticism is "a perfectly possible and satisfactory activity : after all, we do it every day." The nature of the world, dependent as it is on our perception, is such that no task, even those we may regard as purely scientific, is ever fully completed. We live, as Davis says, "from compromise to compromise ." We may feel satisfied at one moment with what we have accomplished , but soon we will find it in need of redoing, just as others will have to do it in their own ways, and then do it again. In the ninety-eighth chapter of Moby-Dick, Melville describes the process of scrubbing down the decks after the oil has been extracted from a whale; but no sooner is this activity finished than another whale is sighted, and the whole sequence , from killing the whale to cleaning up the ship afterward, must be performed again: Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when— There she blows! —the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life's old routine again. In the face of this ineluctable cycle, we are better advised to embrace and cherish it than to lament it. Every editor who edits or re-edits a work is participating in an invigorating, if unending, struggle—the same one that literary critics are engaged in, though the less perceptive members of both groups fail to recognize their common pursuit. Textual critics, instead of being removed from direct engagement with literature—as many people imagine—are partaking of it fully. Their multifarious, unceasing efforts, which can never be more than tentative, exemplify the richest kind of experience that readers can have.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This is the sixth in a series of essays I have written covering the second half of the twentieth century; it, like the others, is limited to general theoretical writings in English and does not attempt to deal with textual studies of particular authors or individual editions . The first three essays, published in Studies in Bibliography [ SB ] in 1975, 1981, and 1986, were brought out in book form in 1987 as Textual Criticism since Greg: A Chronicle, 1950-1985. The fourth and fifth appeared in SB as follows: "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," SB, 44 (1991), 83-143; and "Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism," SB, 49 (1996), 1-60. (A portion of the last, in slightly revised form, was published as "Reflections on Scholarly Editing" in Raritan, 16.2 [Fall 1996], 52-64.) 2 W. Speed Hill has discussed seven of the first eight volumes in the series in "Editorial Theory and Literary Criticism: Lamb and Wolf?", Review, 19 (1997), 37-64. 3 It must also be said that Trevor Howard-Hill, as editor of Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, has done an excellent job with reviews (especially, one is tempted to say, when he writes them himself); but he cannot concentrate on textual matters, since the scope of his journal is much broader. Lengthy reviews of documentary editions also regularly appear in Documentary Editing. 4 Several are entirely devoted to individual authors and thus are outside the scope of the present essay. Many of the 1995-2000 volumes are recorded in notes 5-12 below, and some of them are taken up again at various later points in the essay. In the previous (1996) essay in this series (see note 1 above), I commented on the anthology phenomenon on pp. 1819 and discussed some of the volumes from the early 1990s on pp. 19-33. 5 Contemporary German Editorial Theory, ed.

Abbott's An Introduction to Bibliographical and Textual Studies, originally published in 1985, came out in a third edition in 1999. (An essay-length introduction also appeared during this time: W. R. Owens's "Editing Literary Texts," in A Handbook to Literary Research, ed. Simon Eliot and W. R. Owens [1998], pp. 63-81, which uses most of its brief space for two extended examples.) 14 Of the four checklists, one is an expansion of a previously published work: T. H. Howard-Hill's marvelously thorough and admirably indexed Shakespearian Bibliography and Textual Criticism: A Bibliography (2000), an updated revision of his 1971 volume (with coverage extended to 1995). (Among his other publications during this period was the 198089 volume [1999] of his Index to British Literary Bibliography. ) A related checklist is Jeremy Lopez's "An Annotated Bibliography of Textual Scholarship in [non-Shakespearean] Elizabethan Drama, 1973-1998," Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama, 29 (2000), 17-76. The other two works have a broader scope, and the more comprehensive of the two is my Introduction to Scholarly Editing: Seminar Syllabus (1998), which attempts to provide basic reading lists for beginners as well as an extensive record of the literature of the field, including analytical bibliography. (I should note that a revised edition, expanded to 257 pages, was published in 2002; its listing of books and articles from the 1995-2000 period includes more items than are mentioned in the present essay.) The other checklist is clearly the least valuable of the four: William Baker and Kenneth Womack's Twentieth-Century Bibliography and Textual Criticism: An Annotated Bibliography (2000), containing 769 entries divided into six sections, in each of which the ploddingly annotated items are arranged alphabetically by author. It is hard to know who will find this volume helpful: the 225 entries under "Textual Criticism"—especially arranged and annotated as they are—will not readily guide a beginner into the field, and an advanced scholar will not wish to use such a restricted list to search for relevant scholarship. 15 Michael Hunter, "How to Edit a Seventeenth-Century Manuscript: Principles and Practice," The Seventeenth Century, 10 (1995), 277-310; Michael E. Stevens and Steven B. Burg, Editing Historical Documents: A Handbook of Practice (1997); Mary-Jo Kline, A Guide to Documentary Editing (originally published in 1987 and revised in 1998); and David L. Vander Meulen and G. Thomas Tanselle, "A System of Manuscript Transcription," SB, 52 (1999), 201-212. The last of these criticizes the other three for not adequately distinguishing transcription from emendation, since all three allow the task of transcription to include the alteration of certain features of the manuscript texts. (The Vander Meulen-Tanselle piece also presents a new form of inclusive notation that avoids symbols and permits readers easily to recognize the final reading at each point of revision.) I should perhaps call attention to another guide to transcription, even though it appeared after 2000: P. D. A. Harvey's Editing Historical Records (2001), which—despite being sensible in general and recognizing the dangers of normalization—does not entirely avoid the problem of those three earlier works (allowing, for example, categories of silent alterations). (Luciana Duranti's Diplomatics: New Uses for an Old Science [1998] deals exclusively with the archival management and authentication of documents and does not take up so-called diplomatic transcription.) 16 I have written about the events surrounding this publication in "The Librarians' Double-Cross," Raritan, 21.4 (Spring 2002), 245-263, which also reviews Baker's important related book, Double Fold: Librarians and the Assault on Paper (2001). Some of the earlier pieces in my campaign to save originals are collected in my Literature and Artifacts (1998); those from the period under review here are "The Future of Primary Records," pp. 96-123, and "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records [for the Modern Language Association's Ad Hoc Committee on the Future of the Print Record]," pp. 335-337. 17 There were other, if less public, instances of attention to the history of editing, such as Tim William Machan, "Speght's Works and the Invention of Chaucer," Text, 8 (1995), 145-170; Jean I. Marsden, The Re-Imagined Text: Shakespeare, Adaptation, &amp; EighteenthCentury Literary Theory (1995); Charlotte Brewer, Editing "Piers Plowman": The Evolution of the Text (1996); Alain Corbellari, "Joseph Bédier, Philologist and Writer," in Medievalism and the Modernist Temper, ed.

Bajetta's edition of McKerrow's 1928 Sandars Lectures in SB, 53 (2000), 1-65. Also during this period Joseph Rosenblum edited Sir Walter Wilson Greg: A Collection of His Writings (1998). 18 Editing Texts in the History of Science and Medicine, ed. Trevor H. Levere (1982); Editing Modern Economists, ed. D. E. Moggridge (1988); Critical Issues in Editing Exploration Texts (see note 6 above); Music Discourse from Classical to Early Modern Times (see note 6 above). The partially verbal genre of atlases has also been treated in Editing Early and Historical Atlases (see note 6 above). (On atlases, see also Mary Sponberg Pedley, "Atlas Editing in Enlightenment France," Scholarly Publishing, 27 [1995-96], 100-117.) 19 His 1997 essay "Oral Tradition into Textuality," in Texts and Textuality (see note 8 above), pp. 1-24, is both a concise survey of scholarly trends and also a manifesto for a way of reading that recognizes performance clues in the tangible text, allowing the text to "teach us to read it" (p. 15). (As the title of the essay suggests, he uses "text" only to refer to tangible texts. In my view, it would be preferable to regard the elements of the oral performance as constituting a text also; editors interested in the oral work could then be described as attempting to reconstruct the text of a performance from the text of a document . But my point is not a crucial one, since it only involves a matter of definition, and Foley's discussion is not affected adversely by his use of a different definition.) The essay draws on his fuller argument in The Singer of Tales in Performance (1995); see chapter 3, "The Rhetorical Persistence of Traditional Forms," pp. 60-98, where he speaks of the physical text as a "libretto for the reader's performance" (p. 97), once one learns that "traditional forms and strategies persist in texts as rhetorically active signals" (p. 95). Foley also wrote the chapter on "Folk Literature," a historical account of editing in the field, for the 1995 anthology Scholarly Editing (see note 8 above), pp. 600-626. For other recent instances of linking oral and written traditions, see Margaret Clunies Ross, "Editing the Oral Text: Medieval and Modern Transformations," in The Editorial Gaze (see note 8 above), pp. 173192 , and the 1999 Toronto volume, Talking on the Page (see note 6 above). 20 See my 1991 essay in this series (see note 1 above), pp. 122-128. In Shakespeare and the Authority of Performance (1997), W. B. Worthen has offered a thorough discussion of "basic questions about the page, the stage, and the acting of authority" (p. 4), drawing heavily on recent editorial theory ("Authority and Performance," pp. 1-43). 21 Of course, stage productions that have been filmed fall into the same category as cinematic works (as far as this one point is concerned); but the number of such films is tiny in comparison to all the dramatic performances that could not have been, or were not, filmed. (And of course such a film may not show every nonverbal detail that would have been visible to a theater audience, whereas in cinematic works the nonverbal elements that are visible in a given version are by definition the only ones that exist in that particular version of the work.) 22 "The Auteur-Author Paradox: How Critics of the Cinema and the Novel Talk about Flawed or Even `Mutilated' Texts," Studies in the Novel (see note 11 above), 27 (1995), 413426 . 23 "Knowing the Score: Italian Opera as Work and Play," Text, 8 (1995), 1-24. The same volume of Text also contains Ellen J. Burns, "Opera as Heard: A Libretto Edition for Phenomenological Study," pp. 185-216. Other similar signs are Catherine Coppola, "The Working Relationship between Elliot Carter and Bernard Greenhouse: Implications Regarding Issues of Text and Performance," Text, 9 (1996), 315-325 (which cites as an analogy Philip Gaskell's discussion of Tom Stoppard in From Writer to Reader [1978]); and Robyn Holmes, "Australian Music Editing and Authenticity: `Would the Real Mrs Monk please stand up?'," in The Editorial Gaze (see note 8 above), pp. 209-226. The issues raised by recordings and player-piano rolls have also been discussed in recent years: Jeff Brownrigg, "The Art of Audio-Editing: Re-Presenting Early Australian Vocal Recordings," in The Editorial Gaze (see note 8 above), pp. 193-208; Kenneth Womack, "Editing the Beatles: Addressing the Roles of Authority and Editorial Theory in the Creation of Popular Music's Most Valuable Canon," Text, 11 (1998), 189-205; and Andrew Durkin, "The Self-Playing Piano as a Site for Textual Criticism," Text, 12 (1999), 167-188. 24 "The Definition of `Text,' " Text [Uppsala], 5.2 (1998), 50-69 (quotation from pp. 57 and 67). To him, this definition entails distinguishing texts of documents from texts in documents . The latter is the text that is part of a physical object; the former is the same " sequence " (of words and punctuation) wherever it appears (this is what to him is a "real text" because if "text" means "sequence," and sequence is an abstract concept, a physical text cannot "belong to the text concept proper" [p. 67].) I do not find this elaboration necessary, for I see nothing illogical in speaking of (for example) the identity of two texts in two documents . Sequence is simply the abstract concept used to analyze a combination of elements, and it applies equally to tangible and intangible expressions of that combination. 25 The editors of Text saw fit, for example, to publish Janis C. Bell's "The Critical Reception of Raphael's Coloring in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries," Text, 9 (1996), 199-215. The Society had been founded in 1979 as "an organization devoted to the interdisciplinary discussion of textual theory and practice" (as explained in the first volume of Text [1984 for 1981]). The "plastic arts" are also included in Pierre-Marc de Biasi's survey of the extension of genetic criticism to nonliterary and nonverbal works; see "Horizons for Genetic Studies," Word &amp; Image (see note 11 above), 13 (1997), 124-134 (commented on very briefly in the treatment of critique génétique in part II below). 26 Strangely enough, he considers modernizing to be a part of the process of transcription (as on p. 2). (Cf. note 15 above.) 27 Unfortunately, however, Grier on occasion undercuts this welcome point, as when he allows himself to say, "Before anything can be done to a piece, performance, analysis, historical studies, its text must be made known to those who would pursue these undertakings . And the presentation of the text is the editor's job" (p. 37). This sounds surprisingly like the old notion of editors providing texts for critics to analyze—a notion not entirely overturned by Grier's next sentence, which calls an edition "not so much a tool, leading to higher ends, as an active, critical participant in those ends." For the split has already been asserted, rather than an emphasis on the editorial element in every reader's response and thus on the editor's task as essentially the same as that of all other readers. 28 Grier's accounts of the "semiotic nature of music notation" (as on pp. 25-27), which are apparently meant to distinguish music scores from verbal texts on paper, do not in fact do so: are not the meanings of letterforms and punctuation, like those of music notation, dependent on "context and convention" (p. 67)? 29 To name one more: Grier says that Greg's copy-text approach "fails as a theory for one simple reason: the difficulty in creating an unequivocal definition of substantive and accidental" (p. 107). This remark reflects a failure not only to understand the firm distinction Greg actually made but also to comprehend that the distinction is ultimately not central to the theory. Furthermore, to add that "the physical presentation . . . of the work and text can carry significant meaning" does not in any way contradict Greg's theory. 30 He is also a visual artist himself, and anyone who saw his installation "White Noise" at the Whitney Museum in August 2001 knows how elegant and moving his work can be. 31 The lucidity of Grigely's language stands out sharply in contrast to the prose of Nicole Fugman, who also examines art works in her attempt "to reconceptualize textual criticism and situate it in the ensemble of critique which encompasses philology, historiography , and aesthetics"; see "Contemporary Editorial Theory and the Transvaluation of Postmodern Critique," Text, 10 (1997), 15-29 (quotation from p. 19). 32 Even a label on the reverse, once one knows about it, plays its role: the reverse "is a still life because this is the location where the transience of the artwork is documented, where traces are accumulated of its passage through particular places at particular times" (p. 177). In an impressively wide-ranging book about the role of memory in culture ( Cultural Selection, 1996), Gary Taylor offers similar observations on a painting, Velázquez's Las Meninas, noting that its position in the "edited collection" of the Prado affects its meaning and that works are inevitably subject to "transformations" (such as the photograph of Las Meninas in his book) as they become "dispersed among many members of a society." The generally unremembered or "invisible" persons who perform these transformations (including "reproducers, restorers, curators") may all be called "editors," and "the editorial process fundamentally affects everything we remember about the achievements of the past" (pp. 122-125, in the chapter entitled "Invisible Man," pp. 121-142). (He had made some of the same points in an earlier essay, "What Is an Author [Not]?", Critical Survey [see note 11 above], 7 [1995], 241-254.) Paul Eggert has also discussed the role of the viewer and restorer in the construction of works of visual art, in the third section of his "Where Are We Now with Authorship and the Work?", Yearbook of English Studies (see note 11 above), 29 (1999), 88-102. 33 The writers in Text were Hans Walter Gabler, Louis Hay, Jean-Louis Lebrave, and Klaus Hurlebusch; those in SB were Hay, Gerhard Neumann, Hurlebusch, and Siegfried Scheibe. I have discussed these pieces in the 1991 essay in this series (see note 1 above), pp. 112-118, and in the 1975 article cited there in note 37. (See also the 1996 essay in the series, note 85.) 34 "Towards a New Manuscriptology: Génésis, Volumes 1-6," Text, 10 (1997), 362-368. Falconer notes the emphasis on "the inner dynamics of writing, the poetics of composition rather than the context and circumstances in which that composition occurred" (which causes him to say that history is "singularly absent from these pages"); and he praises the journal's "openness to discussions of non-literary art forms" (p. 367). 35 The Greetham volume deals with traditions in German (by Bodo Plachta), Italian (Paolo Cherchi), Russian (Edward Kasinec and Robert Whittaker), Old and early modern French (Mary B. Speer, Edmund Campion), and medieval Spanish (Alberto Blecua and Germán Orduna), as well as Greek (Bruce M. Metzger, Mervin R. Dilts), Latin (R. J. Tarrant), Hebrew (Francis I. Andersen), Arabic (M. G. Carter), and Sanskrit (Ludo Rocher). (See also Edwin Rabbie, "Editing Neo-Latin Texts," Editio, 10 [1996], 25-48.) The Bowers assemblage (see note 12 above) includes comments on work in Italy (Conor Fahy), France (Wallace Kirsop) , Spain (David R. Whitesell), and Japan (Hiroshi Yamashita). (For those who read German and French, current checklists of scholarship are published in Editio and Génésis; and see Jacques Neefs, "A Select Bibliography of Genetic Criticism," Yale French Studies, 89 [1996], 265-267. 36 An anthology largely on classical literature, Glenn W. Most's Editing Texts, Texte edieren (1998), has the laudable aim of helping to bridge the editorial "theory gap" between classicists and scholars of the modern literatures. As Most says, textual theory has been much more discussed in recent years by the latter group than by the former, which has "neglected or downplayed, for the most part, the thorny theoretical questions raised by the practice of textual editing" (p. viii). The contributions, however, will do more to give the modernliterature editors some examples of the work of classicists than it will to acquaint classicists with recent thinking among modern-literature editors. An effort with a somewhat similar aim in the biblical field is Ferdinand E. Deist's brief piece on "Texts, Textuality, and Textual Criticism," Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages, 21.2 (1995), 59-67; he wishes to acquaint biblical scholars with the ways in which textual criticism is affected by such movements as poststructuralism and deconstruction (which have "much in common with rabbinistic interpretations" [p. 66]), as well as to show the assumptions that underlie traditional textual criticism (but unfortunately he does not point out what is wrong with thinking of it as "preparatory text restoration" [p. 60]). 37 Eclecticism need not be associated only with an interest in authorial intention, for there are other goals that emendation can support. But that is a separate point. 38 I do not understand how Zeller got the idea that Anglo-American editors do not record documentary variants, including those in manuscripts. He even claims, incredibly, that the bias of Anglo-American editors has prevented them "from devoting the same attention to manuscript versions as . . . to the printed ones" (p. 97). Zeller's two essays commented on here are "Record and Interpretation: Analysis and Documentation as Goal and Method of Editing," pp. 17-58; and "Structure and Genesis in Editing: On German and Anglo-American Textual Criticism," pp. 95-123. 39 "In Between the `Royal Way' of Philology and `Occult Science': Some Remarks about German Discussion on Text Constitution in the Last Ten Years," trans. Dieter Neiteler , Text, 12 (1999), 31-47. 40 It is not clear what he means (especially in this context) when he says, "To my mind, . . . the edited text, and not the text reproduced in facsimile, must remain `the main part of an edition', because it is the edited text alone that enables the response of the reader" (p. 47). 41 "A Resistence to Contemporary German Editorial Theory and Practice," Editio, 12 (1998), 138-150. 42 Another way in which the essay could have been improved is that the distinction between "version" and "document" could have been made explicit. Near the beginning, Shillingsburg says that many of the essays in the German anthology state that reports of the historical record "take precedence over any attempts to meld versions into an eclectic text" (p. 141)—as if that is indeed how eclectic texts are constructed. 43 Among the French contributions are essays by Graham Falconer, Almuth Grésillon, Louis Hay, Jean-Louis Lebrave, and Jacques Neefs, names that will be familiar to those who have read in this area. 44 "Editing Manuscripts: Towards a Typology of Recent French Genetic Editions, 1980-1995," trans. Helène Erlichson, Text, 12 (1999), 1-30. Cf. his "What Is a Literary Draft? Toward a Functional Typology of Genetic Documentation," Yale French Studies, 89 (1996), 26-58. 45 The use of "text" to refer primarily to the final text of a work (as when a vertical edition "reaches the textual stage itself" [p. 26]) is a further drawback. The fact that every stage has a text is glimpsed only sporadically here, as in the phrase "the textual text" (p. 20). (Surely the problem is not entirely attributable to the translator.) 46 "Understanding the Author's Compositional Method: Prolegomenon to a Hermeneutics of Genetic Writing," trans. Uta Nitschke-Stumpf and Hans Walter Gabler, Text, 13 (2000), 55-101 (quotation from p. 64). Another unuseful attempt to cross geographical boundaries is the superficial and uncritical survey of national traditions by Marita Mathijsen ("The Future of Textual Editing") contributed to the 1998 anthology Editing the Text (see note 10 above), pp. 45-54—an anthology with a notably careless and unperceptive introduction , which finds an editorial "crisis" in "all three great traditions" (English, French, and German). 47 "Textual Perspectives in Italy: From Pasquali's Historicism to the Challenge of `Variantistica' (and Beyond)," Text, 11 (1998), 155-188. 48 "The `New Philology' from an Italian Perspective," Text, 12 (1999), 49-58; this article, translated by Marcello Cherchi, was originally published in Italian in a 1997 German anthology, Alte und neue Philologie, ed. Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and Franz Lebsanft, pp. 35-42. 49 David R. Whitesell, "Fredson Bowers and the Editing of Spanish Golden Age Drama," Text (see note 12 above), 8 (1995), 67-84; Carol Bingham Kirby, "Editing Spanish Golden Age Dramatic Texts: Past, Present, and Future Models," Text, 8 (1995), 171-184; H. T. M. van Vliet, "Scholarly Editing in the Netherlands," Text, 13 (2000), 103-129; Annemarie Kets-Vree, "Dutch Scholarly Editing: The Historical-Critical Edition in Practice," Text, 13 (2000), 131-149. Cf. van Vliet and Kets-Vree, "Scholarly Editing in the Netherlands," Literary &amp; Linguistic Computing (see note 11 above), 15 (2000), 65-72. 50 I have discussed the first edition in the 1986 essay in this series (see note 1 above), pp. 39-45 (pp. 147-153 in Textual Criticism since Greg ). 51 Such as the new opening of "Ideal Texts" (p. 75) or the new second and third paragraphs of "Economics and Editorial Goals" (pp. 123-124). One substantial insertion is a good five-page discussion of Hans W. Gabler's and John Kidd's differing approaches to editing Ulysses (pp. 109-114); and the chapters on the use of computers have a high concentration of revisions that take technical developments into account. 52 I wish his discussion had covered three points more explicitly than it does: (1) although he notes "the tendency to equate versions of the work with documents of the work" (p. 97), he does not comment on the possibility that a document may contain more than one version; (2) his claim that "authors cannot say in texts things that cannot be represented in linguistic or iconic signs on paper" (p. 96) illustrates his neglect of oral texts; and (3) he does not give very clear recognition to collaborative or social intention, in addition to authorial intention, as a possible goal of critical editing. 53 Whether this is the case of course depends on the relative skill with which the texts have been supplied with cross-references and lists of variants. 54 It first appeared on the internet, where it is available (in a text dated 6 May 1995, as of this writing) at &lt;http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/public/jjm2f/rationale.html&gt;. Its first printed appearance was in a shortened form in European English Messenger, 4.2 (Autumn 1995), 34-40 (which concentrates on the examples and leaves out the introductory section, the sections entitled "Hyperediting and Hypermedia" and "Coda," and the notes, as well as scattered shorter passages). The full version has been published with modifications (primarily the addition of several paragraphs to the discussion of Example D) in Text, 9 (1996), 11-32 (the text cited here) and in Electronic Text, ed. Kathryn Sutherland (1997), pp. 19-46. (In the title, "HyperText" has a capital middle "T" in the internet and Text appearances but not in the other two.) 55 As he himself says later, "Enthusiasts for hypertext sometimes make extravagant philosophical claims" p. 28). 56 McGann persists in distinguishing "poetry" and "expository text" in "Endnote: What Is Text?", in Ma(r)king the Text (see note 10 above), pp. 329-333. In this piece, he quite properly criticizes the limitations in the concept of text that underlies the Text Encoding Initiative, which concentrates on the "narrowly `linguistic' " elements and neglects the "more broadly `semiotic' " ones (p. 331); but the criticism is relevant to the encoding of all texts, not just those that he believes can be segregated as " `poetic' or non-informational forms of textuality" (p. 330). 57 As an analogue, he cites the study of the physical world, in which "it makes a great difference if the level of the analysis is experiential (direct) or mathematical (abstract)" (p. 12). But it is hard to see what parallelism McGann has in mind, for both the codex and the electronic presentations of textual evidence are empirical (or "experiential") in approach. 58 One rarely hears the other side: the codex form has its advantages, too, at least for some people. It is not necessarily the case, for example, that turning a few leaves is more difficult or time-consuming than entering a search command or pressing a key to move to a variant text. But there is no doubt that many (if not all) people will find it easier in electronic form to do many (but not all) of the things one wishes to do in the course of careful reading. 59 In his 1998 presidential address to the Society for Textual Scholarship ("Hideous Progeny, Rough Beasts: Editing as a Theoretical Pursuit," Text, 11 [1998], 1-16), which includes an interesting historical account of his Rossetti Hypermedia Archive, McGann repeats his baseless claim that "The value of computerization for the study of books and texts lies exactly in the fact that with computerized tools we do not bring books to study books"; he adds, "when our tools function at higher levels of abstraction from the materials we are studying, we create conditions for new orders of certainty" (p. 12). Another instance of his hyperbole in this piece: "Editing in paper-based formats, I came to understand, literally creates the set of contradictions that mark the differences between documentary and critical approaches to editing" (p. 7). These differences (which are not "contradictions," reflecting as they do complementary approaches) obviously exist on a conceptual level and cannot be created by one form of implementation. Documentary and critical presentations may often be easier to use in electronic form, but the differences between them obviously remain. Perhaps such misconceptions are related to a more basic one: his naïve belief that "the ` hypothesis ' represented by an editorial undertaking is very different from the hypothesis of a theoretical or interpretive book or essay" (pp. 7-8)—a strange point to make a few pages after the (correct) assertion that certain landmark editions "are polemical works bearing within themselves complex and far-reaching arguments" (p. 3). 60 Though they do contain some questionable statements, as when he calls a particular edition "a reader's edition, not a critical edition" (p. 18)—a problematical distinction under any circumstances, but especially so given his earlier comments. 61 He speaks only of libraries in which the books themselves are shelved according to a subject classification; but his basic point of course remains valid for those libraries where the books are arranged in accession order and where subject access is only through a catalogue. 62 She quotes him as saying that "the work is held in the hand, the text is held in language" (p. 3). But the work/text distinction that she believes has been undercut is the one more commonly made by textual critics, in which the signification of the two terms is approximately reversed. She allows this switch in usage to distract her from looking into the concepts that the terms refer to in each case. 63 The essays alluded to in this paragraph are: Renear, "Out of Praxis: Three (Meta)Theories of Textuality," pp. 107-126; Flanders, "The Body Encoded: Questions of Gender and the Electronic Text," pp. 127-144; Robinson, "New Directions in Critical Editing," pp. 145-171; Conner, "Lighting out for the Territory: Hypertext, Ideology, and Huckleberry Finn, " pp. 67-106; Donaldson, "Digital Archive as Expanded Text: Shakespeare and Electronic Textuality," pp. 173-198; Lamont, "Annotating a Text: Literary Theory and Electronic Hypertext," pp. 47-66. (Another article of Flanders's, misleadingly entitled "Trusting the Electronic Edition," is a superficial discussion of the role of images in electronic editions; see Computers and the Humanities, 31 [1997-98], 301-310.) 64 He quite rightly implies the continuing value of consulting originals, as when he says that "the availability of a digital reproduction does not in any way render the original any less available" (p. 241). I must note by the way that this point is applicable primarily to manuscripts and pre-nineteenth-century printed items; a great many post-1800 printed items have been, and continue to be, destroyed precisely because some librarians believe that reproductions render the space-consuming originals unnecessary. (On this issue, see, among other essays of mine, the ones cited in note 16 above.) 65 The volume should have ended with Unsworth's thoughtful essay, not with the "Afterword" (pp. 245-248) by A. Walton Litz, who simply repeats glib exaggerations about how "electronic resources have profoundly affected many of our conceptions of the editor's function" (p. 245). (It must be noted that Finneran himself, in his preface, speaks of digital technology producing "a fundamental paradigm shift.") Litz is right to think of "electronic editing as another form of criticism" (p. 246) but wrong to believe the word "electronic" is necessary, since editing has always been a form of criticism. And it is strange that he then insists on the electronic editor's "nonintervention" (p. 248)—the impossibility and undesirability of which are recognized in several of the essays in the volume. (The titles of the essays mentioned in this paragraph are as follows: Hockey, "Creating and Using Electronic Editions," pp. 1-21; Shillingsburg, "Principles for Electronic Archives, Scholarly Editions, and Tutorials," pp. 23-35; Unsworth, "Electronic Scholarship; or, Scholarly Publishing and the Public," pp. 233-243.) 66 Ross, "The Electronic Text and the Death of the Critical Edition," pp. 225-231; Doss, "Traditional Theory and Innovative Practice: The Electronic Editor as Poststructuralist Reader," pp. 213-224. 67 As when he says that "hypertext allows a reader to escape the linearity imposed by print media" (p. 219). 68 This point is well taken even if one doubts Doss's notion that "the aesthetic character of the textual editor's job is more apparent in hypertext environments than in print" (p. 217). Another anthology substantially devoted to the computer—but in this case to its role in analyzing texts rather than presenting them—is Studies in Stemmatology (1996; see note 9 above), based on a series of colloquia at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, reflecting "the newly recovered field of stemmatology" (p. xii). The editors of the volume, Pieter van Reenen and Margot van Mulken, assert in their "Prologue" that the use of the computer for stemmatic analysis of difficult traditions has resulted in "heightened awareness of the limitations of the researcher's own capacities and those of the computer." This development, if true, is obviously for the good, as is the idea that the stemma "is no longer seen as an authoritative prescriptive scheme which an editor should blindly apply to his manuscript tradition"—something it should never have been. That the computer may somehow have helped to inject basic critical sense into the field is not, however, a reason to believe that "the implementation of the computer has fundamental theoretical implications " (p. ix). An example of the good sense that follows from regarding the stemma as "guiding and advisory," not "prescriptive" (p. 99), is Peter M. W. Robinson's contribution, "Computer-Assisted Stemmatic Analysis and `Best-Text' Historical Editing" (pp. 71-103). By "best text" he does not mean what that term has historically meant but rather uses it as a synonym for "base text" (or, one might add, "copy-text"), which is subject to emendations through editorial judgment. What he says, therefore, is not news to editors of modern literature , but it is good to have this clear statement of it applied to medieval literature. 69 See his "Reading, Scholarship, and Hypertext Editions," Text, 8 (1995), 109-124; and "Electronic Editions and the Needs of Readers," in New Ways of Looking at Old Texts, Il (see note 8 above), pp. 149-156. The quotations below are from the first. 70 A view that Germaine Warkentin has called "the untethered Utopianism of the new age of the computer" (in her review of The Margins of the Text, ed. D. C. Greetham [1997], in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada, 36 [1998], 128-130). Ian Small, too, has written of the illusory nature of the freedom that a hypertext archive supposedly offers, since hypertext is structured according to the values of the person(s) who set up the structure; his point is not to suggest that such values should be eliminated but rather to recognize the inevitability of value judgments and to affirm the importance of embracing them—"as editors," he says, "we ought to be as evaluative as possible." See "Postmodernism and the End(s) of Editing," in the 1998 anthology Editing the Text (see note 10 above), pp. 35-43 (quotation from p. 43); and "Identifying Text and Postmodernist Editorial Projects," Yearbook of English Studies (see note 11 above), 29 (1999), 43-56 (which reuses in its last six pages a substantial portion of the earlier article—pp. 37-43—in somewhat revised form). 71 "The One Text and the Many Texts," pp. 5-14 (quotation from p. 13). In his abstract of the essay, he characterizes a reconstructed text as "the text that best explains all the extant documents." In a similar vein, Jesse D. Hurlbut has stated that "part of the editor's role is to recommend possible directions one may choose to follow" through the mass of linked materials, such guidance of course reflecting "the editor's expertise and experience"; see "Shifting Paradigms and the Development of Hypermedia Editions," Studies in Medievalism (see note 12 above), 9 (1997), 228-238 (quotation from p. 233). (Hurlbut's generally sound discussion has its simplistic moments, however, as in the passage that tries to elaborate how electronic editing leads to "reevaluation of the need to designate a base manuscript" [p. 231], without truly seeing the issues or recognizing that they are independent of whether editions are published in codex or electronic form.) 72 "Historical Reading and Editorial Practice," in Ma(r)king the Text (see note 10 above), pp. 193-200 (quotations from p. 199). 73 "In Dreams Begins Responsibility: Novels, Promises, and the Electronic Edition," in Textual Studies and the Common Reader (see note 10 above), pp. 160-179. 74 Such as calling the search for authorial intention "romantic" (pp. 126, 127) and peaking of "the latent idealism of copy-text editing" (p. 130). The article appears in Pilgri- age for Love: Essays in Early Modern Literature in Honor of Josephine A. Roberts, ed. igrid King (1999), pp. 115-132 (the text cited here), and also in Problems of Editing (see ote 7 above), pp. 96-112. 75 Another unfounded complaint is that analytical bibliographers refuse to consider evidence external to the books under investigation. The irresponsible repetition of this criticism is symbolized by the fact that Hugh Amory, in the opening chapter of the first volume of A History of the Book in America ( The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World, ed. Amory and David D. Hall, 2000), refers to "what bibliographers casually dismiss as `external evidence' " (p. 43). Amory knew better, and it is regrettable that he allowed such a major work to be marred by his eagerness to criticize analytical bibliography. 76 The volume, she believes, not only "tackles textual issues in a new light" but also has a "readability" absent from the work of the New Bibliographers, whose writing she criticizes for being "prosaic and straightforward" and eschewing "extended metaphor or creative play" (p. 13). (Anyone familiar with, for example, Pollard's style will find this a strange assertion.) Even Barbara A. Mowat, in her contribution to the anthology, assumes "a post-New Bibliography world" (p. 144), though the New Bibliography remains crucial for her focus on the documentary texts rather than on the attempt to reconstruct authorial manuscripts ("The Problem of Shakespeare's Text(s)," pp. 131-148—an earlier version of which appeared in Shakespeare Jahrbuch, 132 [1996], 26-43). (I should add that the Maguire-Berger anthology, despite its introduction and opening essay, contains more essays of significance than most anthologies, and some of them are commented on below, notably a fine piece by Tom Davis.) Maguire was perhaps hoping to promote the kind of writing that appeared a few years earlier in an essay by Graham Holderness, Bryan Loughrey, and Andrew Murphy, " `What's the Matter?' Shakespeare and Textual Theory," Textual Practice, 9 (1995), 93-119: it contains a particularly extravagant passage in which the New Bibliography is said to involve not only the mixture of the "mechanistic language of materialism" and "an efflux of Platonic idealism" (p. 96) but also "a patriarchal sexualization of the text," in which "the manuscript is a version of the female body" and the "printed text interposes an opaque and obstructive `veil' . . . between the male desire and its object" (p. 97). (Later on the same page the New Bibliographers are found participating in a "re-enactment of the Christian myth," since they arranged for the "incarnated text" to be assumed into "the heaven of authorial intention." Later still: "that virtually all-male club the New Bibliographers evidently cherished beneath their respectable tweed jackets a perverse desire to ravish the printed text in order to release the perfect female body enclosed within it" p. 101].) 77 A more valuable way of critically examining the actual work of the New Bibliographers , and one of more direct usefulness to textual criticism, is offered by the two excellent essays that follow, by Paul Werstine and Michael Warren, which show the lack of foundation for Pollard's and Greg's arguments supporting the idea that certain quarto texts derived from abridgments for provincial use or from memorial reconstruction (Werstine , "Touring and the Construction of Shakespeare Textual Criticism," pp. 45-66; Warren, "Greene's Orlando: W. W. Greg Furioso," pp. 67-91). Werstine, indeed, always writes cogently and intelligently on the history of editorial thinking about Shakespeare; for another admirable example, see his "Editing Shakespeare and Editing without Shakespeare: Wilson, McKerrow, Greg, Bowers, Tanselle, and Copy-Text Editing," Text, 13 (2000), 27-53, which focuses on the disagreements among Wilson, McKerrow, and Greg and thus demonstrates "the enormously diverse principles for editing Shakespeare on offer in the early part of this century" (p. 46). (A somewhat less successful effort is his "Post-Theory Problems in Shakespeare Editing," Yearbook of English Studies (see note 11 above), 29 (1999), 103-117: although his point that play manuscripts took many more varied forms than simply "foul papers" and "prompt-book" is unquestionably worth making, his argument is less effective than it might be, owing to what comes across as an eagerness to criticize Greg and his followers , reflected in continual reference to their "grand narrative" and in reductive summaries of their position.) 78 Despite a number of unfortunate comments such as these in Zimmerman's " Afterword ," it is for the most part a remarkable statement of points that are not usually made: see note 110 below. Paul Werstine, another contributor to the forum, certainly knows that analytical bibliography is independent of editing. However, his contribution, "Editing after the End of Editing" (pp. 47-54), is not up to his usual standard, though he is always worth reading. Here he seems to think one can criticize the effort to segregate compositorial and authorial characteristics by saying that it offers "no way to break the hermeneutic circle" (p. 49). There is nothing objectionable about searching printed texts for clues to the characteristics of an author's manuscript, even when the characteristics of such manuscripts are unknown: the process reflects the nature of the world, the condition (in one degree or another) of all research. What would be objectionable would be not to attempt the search at all. Of course, one may evaluate the care with which it is conducted; but if that was what Werstine was doing, there was no need to invoke the "hermeneutic circle." 79 The shallowness of much of his discussion is epitomized by his statement that " editors must prepare a text, but interpreters and theorists need only articulate an argument" (p. 11). To his credit, however, he also says (rather inconsistently) that "most cultural critics have not become aware that ontological assumptions underlie any attempt to constitute— and therefore to read or theorize—the text of a work" (p. 6). Still another example of a discussion guilty of merging New Bibliography and final authorial intention is Andrew Murphy's " `Came errour here by mysse of man': Editing and the Metaphysics of Presence," Yearbook of English Studies (see note 11 above), 29 (1999), 118-137 (see pp. 131-135), an essay that in many respects is a thoughtful meditation on the "desire for direct individual connection with the author" (p. 133)—though he goes too far in suggesting that intentionalist editors seek a "source of true, irrevocable, unitary meaning" (p. 135). 80 This essay serves as the introduction to his 1997 anthology, Texts and Textuality (see note 8 above), pp. xi-xxxiv, and is a revised version of his introduction to a special 1994 number of Resources for American Literary Study (see note 11 above), pp. 133-18. 81 Cohen even makes it appear that one of McGann's contributions is to show "that the physical form containing a linguistic text is also a text" (p. xvi). McGann would not wish to make this claim, worded in this way, for he knows that analytical bibliographers have long shown how one reads physical evidence to extract a narrative. But their narratives deal with printing history, whereas McGann's involve book design. Cohen compounds the problem : "Such a textualizing of what has traditionally been treated as the physical form containing a text renders analytical bibliography an even more interpretive discipline than it has been heretofore." How can it (or anything) be "more interpretive"? What he presumably means is that its scope is enlarged—which would be true if one calls the analysis of readers' responses to book design "analytical bibliography" (an extension I find unobjectionable) . But the traditional kind of analytical bibliography still has its role to play, and the implication that intentionalist editors ignored design features is not true—for they (quite properly, given their goal) paid attention to design whenever it seemed to be an authorially intended part of a work. (The ubiquity of this inaccurate notion is suggested by Karen Bjelland's offhand and nonsensical remark that "even the bibliographical community has been slow to explore the meaning of its own codes given the continuing influence of Greg"; see "The Editor as Theologian, Historian, and Archaeologist: Shifting Paradigms within Editorial Theory and Their Sociocultural Ramifications," Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography, n.s., 11 [2000], 1-43 [quotation from p. 20].) 82 I should mention that an essay of mine, "The Varieties of Scholarly Editing," appears in this volume (pp. 9-32). Because my piece is introductory, it is unlike all the other essays, which focus on specific fields; and those other essays are what make the volume valuable . (The fields covered, and the scholars responsible for the coverage, are mentioned in note 35 above.) 83 A particularly detailed examination of gender in editing occurs in a different anthology , Textual Formations and Reformations (see note 10 above), where Valerie Wayne discusses, with effective examples, "the ways in which male compositors and editors have created texts that debase and efface women and members of other marginalized groups" ("The Sexual Politics of Textual Transmission," pp. 179-210 [quotation from p. 179]). 84 He concludes (in a fashion typical of his writing) that "if a combination of the [Supreme Court's] Feist decision [on copyright], personalist criticism, local knowledge, and the posthermeneutic dispensation can make us textually dangerous again, then perhaps the loss of philological face will have been worth it." To end with a comment about "losing face" trivializes the whole discussion. (For a perceptive and witty review of this anthology, see T. H. Howard-Hill's in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 92 [1998], 351357.) 85 If beginning students only knew, there are passages not worth their time, since the matters treated in them are handled more clearly and authoritatively elsewhere. A particularly vulnerable area is analytical bibliography: Figure 18, for instance, is useless and possibly misleading, and Figures 24 and 27 could certainly be improved as teaching devices (for they do not make clear that two inner and two outer formes are involved in each case); and the account of setting by formes for a folio in sixes (p. 285) is imprecise and would, I believe , puzzle a beginner. These instances, and others like them, are minor blemishes, to be sure, in relation to the whole work; yet in a textbook such blemishes are not trivial. (See also the third footnote in my 1996 essay in this series [see note 1 above].) 86 I have commented on some of the previously published ones in two earlier essays in this series (see note 1 above): my 1991 essay, pp. 128-130 (commenting on the pieces now prefaced by Interweaves 4-7; and my 1996 essay, p. 26 (Interweave 12), p. 30 (Interweave 17), and p. 48 (Interweave 9). 87 This admirable statement is unfortunately weakened by the phrase "both editorial and critical," which suggests that editorial decisions are not critical. 88 Greetham here chooses the fashionable verb "empowered" despite its inappropriateness for the point he is making; a less assertive expression (such as "reflective of") would convey the meaning better. 89 Bennett's essay (with the subtitle "The Editor And?/Or? the Text") appears in Palimpsest: Editorial Theory in the Humanities, ed. George Bornstein and Ralph G. Williams (1993), pp. 67-96 (quotation from p. 90). 90 Greetham's discussion is rendered particularly unclear by his mixing of a separate point into the "paradox." Bennett says, in the passage already quoted from, "To isolate the editing of works of and by females . . . would defeat the very purpose that inspired ` Classical ' feminism itself." Greetham points out, correctly, that "the editing of works of and by females" is not the only form that feminist editing might take; and he suggests that if Bennett had tried to relate editing to a different kind of feminism, she might not have had the same doubts about feminist editorial theory and therefore might not have found herself in an "awkward position." It is of course legitimate to raise the question of whether her doubts are well founded; but the answer to that question has nothing whatever to do with the claim that her doubts (however they were formed) produce a paradox or place her "into a corner" (p. 440). 91 Many other problematical points could be cited, such as the repeated use of "the text that never was" (as on p. 367) to refer to the product of critical editing, or the related claim that "the result of eclecticism . . . is manifestly un historical" (p. 53)—with no new arguments offered to justify the continual assertion of these questionable ideas. There is even the claim that "The appeal of Reagan and Bush on the one hand and textual idealism on the other was both Edenic and teleological" (p. 372). There are also outright errors, such as saying that "New Bibliography" is a term "used to designate the technical research of analytical and descriptive bibliography" (p. 87). 92 This phraseology is itself off the mark, because no one has been arguing about the comprehensiveness of the intentionalist or the social approaches within themselves; the relevant point is whether the two fit together to form a more comprehensive overview. If a perceived "intentionalist" scholar argues that the two are indeed complementary, that does not make the intentionalist approach itself more comprehensive. 93 In two earlier essays in this series (see note 1 above), I have commented on four of the previously published chapters: in my 1991 essay, p. 131 (on the piece that is now his fifth chapter), and in my 1996 essay, pp. 37-41 (on the pieces that are now his second, third, and seventh chapters). 94 A related point: Shillingsburg thinks that an author's desire not to have a specific intention falls in a different category from authorial intention. For example, after saying that script-act theory is likely to focus on the use of language "to convey meaning," he states that the theory must also cover "script acts for which any response is equally appropriate, for which there was no attempt to imbue the language with intention to be understood or misunderstood" (p. 10). But such a situation is simply another example of authorial intention : the reader's response is defined in terms of what the author had in mind. Two pages later, he contrasts communicative acts with texts that "may never have had specific communicative force in their generation" and with those instances where readers choose not to care about authorial intention; but only the latter in fact describes a situation in which communication is not involved. 95 Shillingsburg admits, "I'm overstating my case." I would have preferred to read what he would have said if he were not overstating his case. 96 He is certainly not opposed to critical (emended) texts, for he believes an electronic edition should include "an archive of edited texts, or at least one edited text, produced to reflect the work of a historian or of several," along with images and searchable texts of "historical documents," as well as historical, critical, and textual commentary (p. 24). Are we to believe that the presence of documentary texts in full will counteract readers' apathy about textual matters and energize them into studying textual variants? 97 This distinction is not quite the same as Shillingsburg's between a "social contract" (in which an author willingly yields some authority to others) and a "production contract" (in which copy-editors or printers, for example, make alterations in texts). When he says that the social contract "should be binding on both the original printer and the modern editor" but that the production contract "has no more standing with a modern editor than the interference of any unauthorized third party" (p. 163), he leaves out the possibility of studying the texts that readers had available to them and were influenced by. (He also confuses the issue by including inadvertent as well as intended changes in the production contract . It seems strange not to include printers' and publishers' intended changes within the social contract, as part of what is entailed by the social process of bringing texts to readers. An interest in publishers' intended texts is not the same as an interest in the texts that were actually published.) 98 All of this chapter (pp. 207-225), except the fourteen paragraphs from the top of page 215 to the bottom of page 218, originally appeared under the title "Editions Half Perceived , Half Created" in Studies in the Literary Imagination (see note 11 above), 29 (1996), 75-88. The added material was in part restated and revised from "Editing Thackeray: A History," Studies in the Novel (see note 11 above), 27 (1995), 363-374. 99 As when he claims that the consensus view among American editors of the 1960s and 1970s held "that best and most reliable were synonymous with the author's final intentions " (p. 211), or when he asserts (not for the first time) that "multiple texts in printed form cannot avoid hierarchic presentation" (p. 211). 100 Negotiating Conflicting Aims in Scholarly Editing: The Problem of Editorial Intentions ," in Problems of Editing (see note 7 above), pp. 1-8. 101 "Social Discourse or Authorial Agency: Bridging the Divide between Editing and Theory," in The Editorial Gaze: Mediating Texts in Literature and the Arts (1998), pp. 97116 . I have conflated the two parts of Eggert's title because the "divide" is not really between editing and theory (since for each theory there are kinds of editions to carry out its principles) but—in the minds of some people—between two theoretical approaches (since some people feel that accepting one requires rejecting the other). 102 Another side-benefit is an interesting discussion of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules —which, however, does not strike me as relevant to the topic at hand. The Rules do, of course, serve as an example of the continuing usefulness of the concept of individual authority for verbal works; but that example has nothing to do with what attitude textual theorists might reasonably hold toward the concept. 103 "Editing the Academy Editions of Australian Literature: Historical Version and Authorial Agency," in The Humanities and a Creative Nation: Jubilee Essays, ed. Deryck M. Schreuder (1995), pp. 69-88; reprinted (slightly revised) as "General-Editing and Theory: Historical Version and Authorial Agency" in Problems of Editing (see note 7 above), pp. 4258 (the text cited here). In this essay, he quotes from his essay-review of Jack Stillinger's Multiple Authority and the Myth of Solitary Genius (1991), "Making Sense of Multiple Authorship," Text, 8 (1995), 305-323, which ends with the same point as these other essays: with his text/document distinction, he believes, "the textual dimension of the work is returned to the documentary level in the act of physical inscription, only to re-emerge again, differently, whenever the document is read." Another comment in this review, a few sentences earlier, is that "the textual apparatus in critical editions might come to be seen as more important than the reading text"; this remark is not so startling as Eggert believes and indeed is very close to comments made by Fredson Bowers, Jo Ann Boydston, and other intentionalist editors. (See, among other places, my 1996 essay in this series [see note 1 above], p. 52.) He is wrong to claim that a critical text is "cut free of its historical moorings" (p. 322), but he is to be applauded for expressing the hope that "the critically edited text would be understood not so much as capturing the literary work in an essential form as participating in it" (p. 312). 104 He believes, surprisingly, that it is at odds with the traditional position, which— he thinks—posits a stable text of the work. But he hardly supports this idea by asserting, "The doctrine of final authorial intention has offered an achievable way of approximating the ideal text of a work, of keeping it singular" (p. 55). It was usually kept singular by the demands of the codex form, and the word "final" was an indication that multiple intentions were recognized (as the apparatus made explicit). Whereas Eggert says that editors of the past wanted to believe in the stability of texts of works, it would be more accurate to say that it was their critics who wanted to believe that this was their position. Other related problems appear in the essay: when, for instance, he discusses (pp. 53-55) the fact that authors ' original intentions (in their minds) are unlikely to be transferred precisely to writing and that what does get written affects what else is written, he asks, "where does this leave editing which appeals to a criterion of authorial intention?" Behind the question would seem to be the assumption that intentionalist editors seek a single "original" intention rather than the intention(s) manifested in acts of writing. (Cf. my comments in the 1996 essay in this series [see note 1 above], pp. 58-59.) Lapses of this kind, however, do not affect the value of the main line of his discussion. 105 In developing his ideas for a 1997 conference paper, "The Work Unravelled" (published in Text, 11 [1998], 41-60), he produced a less successful effort to offer "a different conceptualisation of the literary work" (p. 43). A basic flaw is evident near the beginning when he surprisingly asserts that intended texts cannot be historical because people's minds cannot generally retain long texts in their entirety. But those who believe that intended texts are historical events have never, so far as I am aware, claimed that the quantity of text that can be held in the mind has any relevance whatever to the matter. Authors' or publishers' intentions, as traditionally talked about, are the intentions involved at each moment; those intentions reflect particular concepts, not the simultaneous awareness of every word and mark of punctuation previously selected. That texts are built up in this way on a physical surface does not in any sense invalidate the idea that the physical text may not faithfully represent the intended text and that the intended text is as historical as the documentary one. Eggert's essay proceeds dutifully to sketch the development of philosophical attitudes toward the subject/object problem and then envisages (with, he believes, Theodor Adorno's help) the "work" as something that "unravels, in every moment of its being, into a relationship between its documentary and its textual dimensions" (p. 58). As with the earlier essay discussed above, his use of "textual" to signify "referring to meaning" detracts from the clarity of this conception; but if one makes allowance for this problem, his statement then makes sense but is not in any way revolutionary, for the postulated " relationship " is what has always underlain textual criticism and all kinds of editing. That he uses the negative image of unraveling for this process is, however, strange (and unfortunate); a constructive metaphor of knitting or weaving would be more apt. (On the Academy Editions , see his "Editing a Nation's Literature: The Academy Editions of Australian Literature Project," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin, 20 [1996], 146-153.) In a later essay, "Where Are We Now with Authorship and the Work?" (see note 32 above), he again affirms the importance of the concept of authorship ("authorship has continued to answer to needs and to ways of knowing" [p. 99]) but recognizes that "agency" (which encompasses more than authorship) is "the most focused form of explanation we have in pointing to responsibility for the physical-inscriptional act of text" (p. 102). And he again sets forth positions that are in fact well established, but one cannot complain about such clear restatements of the obvious as the following: "if editors pursue it [final authorial intention] they need to be aware of their own participation in the standard and be aware that their definition of a textual source of authority is inevitably influenced by their own life and times" (p. 101); "the editor asks as the basic question not, What was the intended meaning? but, rather, What was the intended physical inscription?" (p. 102). The first is a given for all discourse; the second is how intention has regularly been defined by intentionalist editors. 106 In "The Dangers of Editing, or, the Death of the Editor," in The Editorial Gaze (see note 8 above), pp. 51-66. Still another writer who wishes "to address the opponents of critical editions" is Nathan Houser, who—as an editor of the Charles Sanders Peirce Edition—offers "a Peircean semiotics of critical editing" and makes a case "for the reality of authorial texts, which, as types, can guide the editing process" (documents are "the signs of the work," and "a work (as a type) stands as a dynamic object for the textual editor"); see "The Semiotics of Critical Editing: Is There a Future for Critical Editions?", in Semiotics around the World, ed. Irmengard Rauch and Gerald F. Carr (1997), pp. 1073-1076. 107 Among other scattered problems in his essay is his handling of what readers " require ." I certainly agree that they need "mediated texts" (by which he means critical texts, though earlier on the same page [p. 61] he had said, with good reason, "A facsimile text is itself mediated"). But he calls this fact about what readers require a "painful truth," since apparently for him the reason for giving readers critical texts is simply that they desire "a received or acceptable text" and do not "want or need" to read the apparatus. The preparation of critical texts, however, has a higher aim than catering to readers' unenlightened preferences. It is not at odds with the effort to encourage readers to see the relevance of textual history to their own reading; indeed, critical texts with apparatus are—and should be publicized as—specialists' guides into, not away from, the complexities of textual history. 108 The first scholarly edition, I believe, to have explicitly followed my suggestion is the volume devoted to This Side of Paradise (1995, edited by James L. W. West III) in the Cambridge edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald. See also two reviews by Richard Bucci: "Serving Fitzgerald's Intentions without a Copy-Text," Text, 14 (2002), 324-333 (a review of Trimalchio , 2000); and his review of Robert Coltrane's 1998 edition of Twelve Men in the Pennsylvania Dreiser edition, Text, 14 (2002), 372-380. Robert H. Hirst plans to follow this approach in future volumes of the "Works of Mark Twain" series (University of California Press). 109 A phrase he used as the title of an article in Common Knowledge, 8 (2002), 516525 . 110 But not very often, except by Shillingsburg and me. One of the few other instances is Susan Zimmerman's "Afterword" to a collection of essays in the 1996 volume of Shakespeare Studies (see note 78 above and the passage to which it is attached). Zimmerman recognizes that "there is a danger in grounding a new editorial practice in a reaction to the insufficiencies of an earlier theory" (p. 72). In commenting on authorial intention, she again is more perceptive than the usual critics: "we should not propose that psychic processes themselves are suspect as an area of historical inquiry, or that such processes are not material" (p. 73). Her conclusion is worth remembering: "perhaps the most important question to bear in mind is not how accurately we represent the past, but how deliberately we formulate the theoretical premises by which we dare to investigate it" (p. 74). 111 Ray's essay (written for a 1972 conference) was first printed in Illinois Libraries, 55 (1973), 235-241, and then included in the conference proceedings, Reading in a Changing World, ed. Foster E. Mohrhardt (1976), pp. 20-30; it was reprinted in Books as a Way of Life: Essays by Gordon N. Ray, ed. G. Thomas Tanselle (1988), pp. 351-364. The quotation (from p. 362) I find so admirable that I have quoted it (or parts of it), in conversation and in print, on many occasions. One of the published instances is "Books, Canons, and the Nature of Dispute," Common Knowledge, 1 (1992), 78-91, reprinted in my Literature and Artifacts (1998), pp. 275-290; in that essay I take up at greater length some of the issues I am commenting on here. And in the third footnote I make this comment: "Because I have repeatedly . . . found fault with those who have opposed an intentionalist approach, it has sometimes been asserted that I am a `defender' of that approach. . . . It would be more accurate , I think, to say that I have criticized the arguments of many of those who have attacked the study of intention. But the pervasiveness of partisan thinking makes it difficult for some people to see dissent in any terms other than a defense of one line and hostility to another. I know of no grounds for being hostile to social textual criticism; but the arguments of many of its advocates are internally unsound, and therefore self-defeating." 112 "The Text of Dryden's Poetry," Huntington Library Quarterly, 63 (2000 [but published later]), 227-244. 113 In a slight 1996 piece he had said that editing is not only "a hot topic" but "arguably the hot topic"; see "The Mechanics of Culture: Editing Shakespeare Today," Shakespeare Studies (see note 12 above), 24 (1996), 30-37 (reprinted, with revisions and additions , in his Shakespeare after Theory [1999], pp. 59-70). This piece, now superseded by his Shakespeare and the Book, need not detain one. 114 David L. Vander Meulen, in "The Editorial Principles of Martinus Scriblerus" (see note 17 above), points out that Pope's fictional editor of The Dunciad Variorum (1729) aims through emendation to reconstruct an authorially intended text, not merely a particular documentary text; Vander Meulen, noting that this goal has in recent years been called "Romantic," then observes, "Scriblerus, in common with other eighteenth-century editors, applies those `Romantic' principles to vernacular literature in the century before they were supposedly devised" (p. 175). 115 I have discussed how such a critical text might be produced in the case of Melville, in "The Text of Melville in the Twenty-First Century," in Melville's Evermoving Dawn: Centennial Essays, ed. John Bryant and Robert Milder (1997), pp. 332-345 (especially pp. 337-338). 116 Contrary to what one might have expected from reading the introduction, Kastan believes that authorial intentions "matter" and are "to some degree . . . recoverable," though in the same passage he irrelevantly says that "in Shakespeare's case they are unavailable" (p. 121)—a pointless idea (though commonly expressed), for the "availability" of anyone's intention is a relative matter and one that does not affect the desirability of attempting to recover it. 117 This part of his sentence stands on its own and should not be introduced by the phrases he places at the beginning: "In the absence of an authentic original, indeed in the absence of a general agreement about what an authentic original might be, . . . ." Even if there were an "authentic original," there would still be textual issues that could be resolved more than one way; and people, quite rightly, would continually feel the necessity to produce new editions. 118 In Textual Formations and Reformations (see note 10 above), pp. 95-111. At this point it is worth recalling Kelvin Everest's point about editing being "at the heart of a living contemporary literary culture" (see the passage above to which note 72 is attached) and Joseph Grigely's view that culture " depends on remaking texts in order to exist" (cited at the end of part I above). Another relevant comment is Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's: "every editor . . . adopts roles that are close to those of singers, poets, or authors, and . . . without taking this step, the role of the editor does not even begin to exist"; see his "Play Your Roles Tactfully! About the Pragmatics of Text-Editing, the Desire for Identification, and the Resistance to Theory," in Editing Texts, Texte edieren (see note 9 above), pp. 237-250 (quotation from p. 238). Still another fine essay that expresses the same general point of view is Marcus Walsh's "Hypotheses, Evidence, Editing, and Explication," Yearbook of English Studies (see note 11 above), 29 (1999), 24-42, which defends the interpretive basis of textual criticism: "Interpreters and editors are in the business . . . of making judgements in the light of available evidence" (p. 28). The resulting "probabilistic knowledge" is "valid knowledge": "Between the Scylla of unattainable fixity and certainty, and the Charybdis of relativism and scepticism, lies the world in which human beings live, in which we can understand each other" (p. 42).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">David Foxon, Humanist Bibliographer by JAMES McLAVERTY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction David Foxon was perhaps the most distinguished British bibliographer of the second half of the twentieth century. His general contribution to bibliography has been widely admired and honoured, and his catalogue English Verse, 1701-1750 (1975) has given his name to half a century of separately published poems. 1 But, while his work has been influential, particularly on the study of the book trade, on the history of pornography, and on eighteenth-century editing, it has been little discussed. This neglect is at least partly due to the fact that Foxon founded no school of bibliography , formulated no theory of bibliographical enquiry, and initiated no general programme of research. Yet the body of his work as a whole displays an impressive consistency of approach and an awareness of the values, motivations, and intentions directing it. My aim in this essay is to provide a record of his life and work in the context of some of the social and intellectual currents of his time. More broadly, I hope to draw attention to the combination of humanist and technical virtues that often informs bibliography but is less frequently identified in discussion of it. A fruitful approach to Foxon's work, I believe, is through an analogy with the `ordinary language philosophy' that formed such an important part of the intellectual atmosphere of post-War Oxford. Foxon breathed this same atmosphere, and, like J. L. Austin, the movement's leading figure, he came to Oxford after serving in war-time intelligence. 2 Foxon was not a philosopher and he was not an adherent of the ` ordinary language' school—its members were comparatively few—but he shared some of the school's approaches and assumptions. Three elements stand out. First there is the concern with ordinary language and meaning. There can be no direct parallel with the philosophers' notorious examination of what was ordinarily said and the search of it for implicit truth—the fruits of enquiring into the meaning of `tympan' are limited—but we do find in Foxon's work a sustained attention to the languages of the book trade and to the codes of the book. Whereas the philosophers to some degree estranged themselves from ordinary language, looking on it as a code to which they already held the analysable key, Foxon looks on the books of the past as codes to which the original practitioners held a key that can be recaptured partly by examining their writings and partly by examining patterns of evidence. Foxon is interested in past institutional facts and the way they are constructed and sustained. 3 The beginning of his Lyell lectures on Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade (delivered in 1976 but not published until 1991) is the most striking example. The first section of the lectures is devoted to `The meaning of the imprint', and as the lectures proceed Foxon explores the meanings of format (for example, an `elzevier edition'), of illustration, of capitals and italics. He is, of course, engaged in code-breaking, but many of the codes are those of the ordinary members of the book trade, who took their language for granted. The second link with Oxford's ordinary language school lies in the way Foxon uses language. In their writing the philosophers aimed at an easy style, consciously engaging with the readership as a social group, but capable of the strictest technical demonstration. Philosophers like J. L. Austin or H. P. Grice move easily from discussing what might be said by this sort of person in this sort of social situation to a technical expression of their conclusions in logical symbols. Foxon shows a similar facility, moving from lucid expository writing (he is a particularly fine narrator) to technical bibliographical description. In this he shows a respect both for what in his early career he regarded as the `gentlemanly' English tradition of bibliography and for the professional American approach. 4 A good example from Foxon's early work is his sensational identification of T. J. Wise's thefts from the British Museum Library, which was presented to the general public in The Times and the TLS in October 1956, and then to the bibliographical community with a clear analysis of the bibliographical requirements for the identification of the theft. Thirdly, ordinary language philosophy was so constituted that it had a ready reply to scepticism, rebutting sceptical challenge by asking, `Why raise that question here and now? What in the situation calls for it?' Foxon always knows what in the immediate social or academic situation gives rise to a question and who might be interested in the answer. Abstract issues have no application. In adopting this approach he contrasts with that drive for definitiveness of research, system, and even sometimes scientific methodology, which has been such an important strand in bibliographical discourse since the War. 5 These claims to foundations and demonstration left bibliography and textual criticism vulnerable to sceptical challenge in the 1990s. 6 Foxon belongs to the alternative broad tradition sketched by Keith Graham: `Deeply rooted in the English intellectual tradition is a feeling for concreteness and particularity, a mistrust of abstract, high-flown generalizations and an insistence that even speculative thought should be anchored in the concreteness of tangible, everyday experience.' 7 Graham reports that a colleague responded to this claim by saying, `Well, could you give me an example?' That was also Foxon's characteristic response. He considered quoting Blake's `To Generalise is to be an Idiot' in his presidential address to the Bibliographical Society in 1981, but worried that it was a generalization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Family and School The trajectory of David Foxon's life was from a family background of provincial nonconformity, through public school, war-time intelligence , and Magdalen College, Oxford, to the British Museum Library, and finally to university teaching at Queen's Ontario and Oxford. The Foxon family had been stocking weavers; Foxon's grandfather kept a couple of weaving-frames in his cottage. He had eleven children, of whom Walter, Foxon's father, was the youngest. After leaving school at twelve, Walter went to work in a stocking factory, but his intelligence and gift for preaching were recognized at Chapel and he was encouraged to go in for the Methodist ministry. He trained at Didsbury College in Manchester, and married Susan Fairweather, the daughter of a well-todo circuit steward in Clitheroe, Lancashire, whom he met when visiting the town to take services. Walter Foxon enjoyed a high reputation as a preacher (`a good preacher, slightly old-fashioned' was his son's verdict), and at one point in his career he turned down the prestigious post at Spurgeon's Tabernacle in South London. Susan Foxon, a firm advocate of women's rights and of total abstinence, was an active pamphleteer and campaigner. Walter Foxon's ability to attract and hold crowds led to his appointment to ministries at a series of seaside towns. David was born at Paignton on 9 January 1923 (he was an only child), and his parents' subsequent homes were at Bournemouth, St Anne's on Sea, Finchley, Blackpool, and Newquay, where, after a spell as President of the District, Walter Foxon retired. David Foxon did not share his father's religious beliefs, but he profoundly admired his father's compassion and sense of social responsibility . Looking back over his life, he believed that some attitudes from his early years—perhaps more recognizably Quaker than Methodist—had stayed with him: a liking for simple and direct truth-telling, with a corresponding anxiety to avoid equivocation and economy with the truth; a distaste for the hypocrisy (particularly over sexual matters) that for much of the century oiled the machinery of daily living; and a dislike of violence and conflict. The first two of these attitudes can be seen directly in his career as a scholar in his lucid, if mild-mannered, exposure of the frauds of T. J. Wise and in his investigation of the history of pornography while the subject was largely taboo. The third attitude might possibly have led to his being a conscientious objector during the Second World War, a potential crisis from which a sympathetic headmaster rescued him by recommending him for intelligence work at Bletchley Park. Foxon also profited from his Methodist background by being brought up in a culture of improvised preaching. He took public speaking as a matter of course, enjoyed it, and throughout his academic career he was able to speak without notes and hold an audience. School, Kingswood near Bath, was a Methodist foundation, one of whose aims was to provide for the education of the sons of itinerant preachers. 8 Foxon spoke of it with affection as a civilized society, tolerant and humane, with a strong record of academic achievement. E. P. Thompson, the historian (`a bit of an exotic'), and A. N. Flew, the philosopher, were Foxon's contemporaries there. The school had resources that particularly appealed to Foxon, including a fine and wellstocked new library. It also had an outstanding headmaster in A. B. Sackett. 9 Foxon was sixteen when World War II broke out, and it was clear that if the war continued he would be called up for active service when he was eighteen. Sackett, knowing and understanding Foxon's scruples, recommended him to the Government Code and Cypher School, which at the outbreak of war had moved from London to Bletchley Park, where it was known as War Station X, or Room 47 Foreign Office, or Government Communications Headquarters. 10 But before going to Bletchley in 1942 Foxon had secured his place at Magdalen College, Oxford. The choice of course was difficult for him. He had performed at a high level in the School Certificate in all subjects and he might have specialized in science or mathematics, but it was traditional for the brightest boys at Kingswood to take classics and Foxon sat the Oxford scholarship exam for Literae Humaniores (Greats). It was C. S. Lewis, a member of the interviewing panel, who suggested that on the basis of his general essay he would be better suited to English, and he sat for an English scholarship successfully the following year. He had to wait until 1946 before he could take up his place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">War-Time Intelligence Bletchley Park was a crucial experience for Foxon, socially and intellectually . It allowed him to mix freely with a variety of gifted, if eccentric, academics, mostly from Oxford or Cambridge, at an early age (he was only nineteen when he went); it gave him training in codebreaking ; and it introduced him to his future wife, June (`Jane') Jarratt. After five weeks in Aberdeen with the Gordon Highlanders (in theory the Bletchley workers were seconded from their units), Foxon was sent to Bletchley, where, after training, he eventually took over from Sydney Easton in charge of a small section deciphering Italian submarine codes; his future wife was a member of the unit. Intercepted messages were translated and then passed on to naval intelligence, who plotted the movements. The work was not exciting but the training was significant for Foxon's later career. A relish for puzzles (and for setting up puzzles), the ability to recognize and interpret patterns, the habit of working from established knowledge (a code book captured on a commando raid) to gain new knowledge, and the sense of intellectual activity as a cooperative venture, all stayed with Foxon and influenced his subsequent work. It can hardly be a coincidence that across the Atlantic, Fredson Bowers, Charlton Hinman, and William H. Bond were members of a naval communications group engaged, as Foxon was shortly to be, in cracking Japanese ciphers. 11 Foxon's transfer to Japanese intelligence came after the fall of Italy. The major tasks in this operation fell to the Americans, with the British in a supplementary role, but one of the British responsibilities was an intercept station in Ceylon and Foxon was sent out there in the summer of 1944, just before D-Day. His was essentially a desk job as co-ordinator of cryptographic intelligence, largely from the Americans. During his time in Colombo, problems with Foxon's health that had plagued him at school resurfaced. He was capable of working very intensely for short periods, but he rapidly became exhausted; it was as though he had difficulty in sustaining the high levels of energy and activity that demanding work generated in him. Although various specialists had been consulted, there was no diagnosis, and Foxon had to learn to manage his energies and ration their output. This was a matter of serious sympathetic concern to Hugh Alexander, later director of GCHQ at Cheltenham, when he came out to Ceylon on a visit in 1944, but there was no solution to the problem, and these periods of exhaustion continued throughout Foxon's working life, resisting treatment through drugs or psychoanalysis . Only in the mid-eighties, after Foxon's retirement in 1982, did a research programme incidentally reveal that he had an adrenalin abnormality , exceptionally high levels of adrenalin accounting for both the periods of high-level activity and the subsequent exhaustion. Colombo allowed Foxon to develop his interest in music. Though never a star performer, and untrained in musical theory, Foxon had developed his enthusiasm for music at Kingswood School and played the piano as a relaxation. When the War made the piano inaccessible, he bought a Dolmetsch treble recorder and took it with him to Ceylon. In Colombo, Ronald Johnson, later head of the Scottish Office, had become the focus of musical activity among local musicians and service personnel, and, through his friendship with Johnson, Foxon became involved in chamber music, lieder singing, and choral music. In particular , he was able to develop his interest in music of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (especially Purcell and Handel) which was particularly suited to his new recorder. Music became a lifelong love, and record-collecting Foxon's major hobby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oxford Foxon returned from Ceylon at the end of the War, and in 1946 began a shortened degree course at Oxford, where Jane Jarratt was already part of the Bletchley diaspora, the friendships made during the War continuing to exert an influence for the next ten years or so. An important link was through Theo Chaundy, Reader in Mathematics and Student of Christ Church, who had been part of Bletchley's reserve force and now offered something like a second home to Jane Jarratt and to Foxon. With Chaundy's son, Christopher, Foxon experimented with electronics and built his first loudspeaker in the Chaundys' workshop, establishing an interest in hi-fi that was to last until his death. Undergraduate study with Jack Bennett and C. S. Lewis was a success. Foxon joined in a discussion society, the Lyly club, with other Magdalen men, and took Lewis's advice to sample Oxford lectures outside his subject. Egon Wellesz, composer and pupil of Hindemith (whose small audiences were particularly in need of Foxon's support), and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, diplomat and author of Eastern Religions and Western Thought, made a particularly strong impression, as did Kenneth Clarke, who showed that a lecture could be constructed round illustrations. Clark's example was something Foxon remembered in preparing his Lyell lectures in Oxford in 1976. In 1947 David Foxon and Jane Jarratt married. Her background was very different from his. Her father Sir Arthur Jarratt had progressed from being a cinema pianist to assuming a public role as the manager of a national chain of cinemas, a friend of Lord Mountbatten's, and a film producer in alliance with Alexander Korda, Herbert Wilcox, and Michael Balcon. Jane Jarratt had come to Bletchley from the Central School for Speech and Drama, and through his marriage Foxon became tangentially connected to a more glamorous social world, though Jane Foxon herself had little time for film society, refused to be presented at court, and much preferred the comradeship of Bletchley. I gained the impression that Foxon relished the contact with the entertainment industry more than she did. The couple shared an interest in the arts, particularly music, and, as Jane brought with her a small private income of ¥200 a year, they were able to live a modest, cultured life, with a wide circle of friends. A daughter, Deborah, was born in 1952. Although the Foxons were divorced in 1963, they remained friends, sharing holidays and family concerns, until Jane's death in 1988. After graduating with first-class honours Foxon started research for a BLitt on the relationship between words and music in the seventeenth century. Although he was given a supervisor from the Music Faculty, Jack Westrup, he was left very much to his own devices. He set himself to read every Restoration play for what it had to say about music and even settled on Purcell's ceremonial odes as a specific topic, but he felt little confidence in his progress with what was potentially a very large project. At this point, late 1948, a circular appeared offering a final opportunity to apply for the civil service. Many of Foxon's Bletchley friends had taken that route and he now decided to follow them. He took the exam successfully (passing out second in mathematics) and survived the country house weekend and the interview with the selection board. (Some flavour of the exercise is conveyed by C. P. Snow's asking Foxon whether he considered it was more important to be than to do.) Foxon was sent to Town and Country Planning, but a casual meeting over lunch changed his career. Angus Wilson, a friend from Bletchley, was now back at the British Museum Library (his piercing tenor soon to become famous during his superintendency of the reading room), and Bentley Bridgewater, who had also been at Bletchley, was now secretary of the Library. These two persuaded Foxon that work at the Library would be more congenial to his temperament and talents, and he successfully applied for transfer to the Museum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">British Museum Library Foxon joined the British Museum Library staff in 1950. After a few months training, he became involved in the Library's major project, the revision of the general catalogue. This work had begun in the 1930s and Foxon came in at the beginning of the letter D. Much of his time was spent on Defoe, where the experience with first editions, chapbooks, and cheap reprints proved invaluable. Subsequently he became involved with Dickens before the revision was brought to a halt. His attention then turned to the Ashley Library, T. J. Wise's collection of English literature. The Ashley Library had been bought en bloc by the Museum in 1937, and its printed books were being added to the catalogue as it was revised. With the major project abandoned, the Ashley books had to be incorporated into the current catalogue, and Foxon was given that responsibility. In 1957 he was put in charge of antiquarian purchasing, and Julian Roberts, who became his colleague a year later, has praised the energy and enthusiasm Foxon brought to this side of the Library's work after the financial difficulties and fierce competition from American libraries of the inter-war years. Roberts has also paid tribute to Foxon's general influence on the Library in the late fifties and early sixties, quoting a comment from the Principal Keeper of Printed Books on Foxon's leaving, `We are all Foxonians now.' 12 The Library brought Foxon into contact with the Bibliographical Society. Frank Francis, then Deputy Keeper of Printed Books but later to become Director of the Museum, was Secretary of the Bibliographical Society and editor of The Library. 13 He encouraged Foxon to become involved in the Bibliographical Society, and he soon became its librarian, spending lunch-hours and Saturday afternoons in the library at the top of a spiral staircase over the British Academy offices, then at the back of the Royal Academy. Foxon served ex officio on the Society's Council, and started to write for The Library and the Book Collector on points he came across in his cataloguing. Francis also made a helpful suggestion. He pointed out to Foxon that a post at the Library opened up the possibility of undertaking some major research project—a seed that was later to bear fruit in the catalogue English Verse, 1701-1750. Foxon saw his early years at the Library as marking an important change in British bibliography, with many of the important influences coming from America. He looked on the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (1940) and John Hayward's catalogue of the Rothschild library as the last gasps of a dying world. 14 The CBEL had great value as a handbook for literary scholars, but it worked by listing books rather than by identifying and describing them. It was a fine example of enumerative bibliography, but it was bibliographical only in a thin sense. Hayward's folio two volumes were more sophisticated in analysis, but their chief aim was to promote the trophies of a rich collector and the number of copies examined was consequently restricted. The catalogue was useful to scholars but it addressed their interests, literary or historical, indirectly. Foxon felt a sympathy for both these forms of bibliography—the scholarly handbook and the detailed record of copies— but he thought the future of bibliography lay in the fusion of the two. He was excited by the new bibliography, mainly centred in the United States. In conversation he singled out the founding of Studies in Bibliography by Fredson Bowers in 1948 as a central event; he was conscious that Bowers's emphasis on physical evidence and on the wide consultation of copies was a continuing influence on him. Other work that greatly impressed Foxon in this period was Allan Stevenson's essay on paper in the first number of Studies in Bibliography and his `Watermarks are Twins' in volume four, and Bill Todd's work on press figures in his thesis. The Americans exposed weaknesses in the gentleman collectors, and these Foxon was determined to avoid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lyrical Ballads Foxon's first essay was `Some Notes on Agenda Format', a technical essay that established his bibliographical credentials, but this was followed very shortly by the essay that was to be the foundation of his reputation. `The Printing of Lyrical Ballads, 1798' was read to the Bibliographical Society on 17 November 1953 and published in the December issue of The Library the following year. This is his first published encounter with T. J. Wise and to that extent represents a meeting between the old bibliography and the new. Lyrical Ballads was a trophy for collectors and Wise had given an account of it in his Bibliography of the Writings in Prose and Verse of William Wordsworth (London, 1916) and Two Lake Poets (London, 1927). Foxon addresses librarians, collectors, and literary scholars, presenting his own conception of bibliography in distinction to Wise's. The paper is written with very close attention to physical evidence—point-holes, a Foxon speciality , but also watermarks in wove paper—and after consultation of as many copies as possible. 15 None of the resulting evidence, Foxon makes it clear, however inconvenient, is to be overlooked, and conclusiveness should not be claimed where it cannot be achieved. The physical evidence is used to reconstruct the history of the production of Lyrical Ballads, but that reconstruction depends on knowledge of the practices of the trade, and especially of printing practices. Foxon is quite explicit about his programme in the first paragraph: `I have tried to approach the whole subject afresh from the point of view of the printer, and the results suggest some modifications in the traditional story' (221). The paper is concerned with four late changes to Lyrical Ballads: the cancellation of `Lewti', because it would have identified Coleridge as author, and its replacement by `The Nightingale'; the consequential change of the Contents page; the addition of a short preface by Wordsworth ; and the replacement of a Bristol title page by a London one. Foxon's account depends on accurate description of the surviving copies and an explanation of the relation between leaves on the basis of the watermarks and surviving point-holes. He first shows that the Contents page is not a cancel, as Wise had claimed (it is conjugate with the first leaf of its gathering) but a proper member of a half-sheet also containing the preface. He then uses point-hole evidence to show that the halfsheet of preliminaries (including the Contents) was printed with the half-sheet used to replace Lewti with `The Nightingale'. The new Contents, therefore, belongs to the same stage of printing as the substitution , and the preface is contemporary with this change. Foxon then turns from the preliminaries to the end of the book, and quotes Wise's account: `O (1 leaf), followed by an unsigned quarter-sheet of two leaves, the first of which has upon its recto the List of Errata, the reverse blank, whilst the second is occupied by the list of Books published . . .' From the printer's point of view this would have been an uneconomical arrangement, and Foxon uses point-hole evidence to show that O 1 and O 2 were conjugate. The presence of only one point-hole suggests these final leaves (O 4 ) were printed by half-sheet imposition, and that O 4 was removed for some other purpose. Foxon speculates that it might have been the original title page. `If . . . we add the title-leaf (which is a singleton) to the three leaves at the end, we have a respectable half-sheet, and I think a modern bibliographer would almost automatically assume that the four leaves were printed together' (225). The title page of Lyrical Ballads is found in two states: one with `Bristol: printed by Biggs and Cottle, for T. N. Longman, PaternosterRow , London, 1798.' and the other with a `London' imprint for `J. &amp; A. Arch'. Foxon suggests that the London title page is indeed a cancel (it has the wrong part of the watermark), but he is perplexed by the Bristol title page, because none of the eight copies traced has the watermark needed to link it to O 4 . Foxon is willing to speculate on a solution— `merely one attempt at stringing together the facts and some of the hypotheses into a consistent whole' (241). He suggests that there may have been three title pages: a `Cottle only' title page, O 4 , which was abandoned when Cottle realized he needed financial help with the edition ; the Bristol title page, which was some form of proof, run off when Cottle thought he had an agreement with Longman; and the London, Arch, title page, which was run off on the correct paper. The abandoned Contents page was also without watermarks, and would belong to the same proofing stage as the Bristol title page. As became his habit, Foxon presents a summary: The full story would then be on the following lines. The body of the book was printed by mid-August, and Southey warned Cottle that it would be a failure. Cottle offered it to Longman, and printed proofs of the Longman title-page. Then `Lewti' was cancelled and the preliminaries printed; and copies were made up with the Longman title-page, since the Wordsworths were about to leave Bristol and wished to see the book completed. These copies were distributed to friends, when suddenly Longman had second thoughts . . . William did what he could to find another publisher. By the time they sailed the agreement had been made with Arch and the book was duly published on 4 October. (240-241) The final element in Foxon's discussion, the association of O 4 with a `Cottle only' title page has recently been challenged successfully in a fine essay by Mark L. Reed. 16 Reed is generous in his assessment of Foxon's essay, calling it `indispensable' and outlining much of its analysis in defining his own position. A copy Foxon had not seen (at the Alexander Turnbull Library) shows that the Bristol title page does sometimes display the same watermark as the rest of the volume and undermines the contention that it was some sort of stop-gap measure. And a fascinating examination of a volume in the McGregor Library of the Special Collections Department of Alderman Library, University of Virginia, reveals a stub, likely to be of the first Contents page, with one of the letters of the watermark in the right place. Reed's conclusion, highly persuasive, is that the original Contents was O 4 and that the Bristol title page was printed at the same time. Reed's analysis shows the basic soundness of Foxon's approach, and, in correcting Foxon's conclusions, it confirms the value of examining multiple copies of a book. Foxon's essay brings together more elements than my brief summary has indicated—evidence of provenance, publication history, acquittal of Wise from one forgery charge—but the concern for easy communication of technically complex information is thoroughgoing. Foxon presents the essay as the fruit of collaboration (he thanks John Hayward, Howard Nixon, Basil Cottle, and American librarians), and suggests that his audience may be able to take the investigation further. A key group of sentences points to Foxon's method of codebreaking. Having given the collation of the volume, he says, If we consider this formula, there is one point which it would be nice to establish. We have here three gatherings of four leaves, 2π, χ, and O. Is there any evidence of how these were printed? This appears to be a matter of pure curiosity, I confess, but it is by pursuing these apparently unimportant matters that one sometimes finds a piece of evidence that may help one elsewhere . (225) The method is to identify irregularities as the key to the whole, treat them as individual puzzles, set about solving them, and then try to collate the results. In this case, Foxon is able to use the evidence of the point-holes to establish the concurrent printing of the cancel section and preliminaries, and then sets about examining the watermark evidence in O 4 . But, though he attends to individual puzzles, Foxon always has a general aim in mind, which is to uncover the story of the printing and publication of Lyrical Ballads to the interested parties. The success of the Lyrical Ballads paper introduced Foxon to two figures who were to be influential in his development: John Hayward and William A. Jackson. Hayward, who had given a different account of Lyrical Ballads in the Rothschild catalogue (II, 703-704), had come to the Library in his wheelchair to check Foxon's account. Hayward was editor of the Book Collector and he encouraged Foxon to publish a series of bibliographical notes, often short but always of high analytical quality, over the next fifteen years. Jackson was then rare books librarian at Harvard and had been responsible for compiling and designing the three-volume Pforzheimer Catalogue. 17 He was in England every summer, working on the revision of the STC. For Foxon he provided an important connection with a major project in enumerative bibliography and also a link with the world of American libraries. When Foxon went to the States on a Harkness Fellowship in 1959-61, it was letters of introduction from Jackson that opened the doors—and even stacks—of American libraries to him. The articles in The Library and Book Collector established Foxon as an authority in analytical bibliography. In 1955 he produced a lucid and well-referenced little pamphlet for the National Book League on The Technique of Bibliography. The approach is informal, but the initial recommendation of McKerrow's Introduction to Bibliography and John Carter's ABC for Book Collectors is supplemented by praise of articles by Bowers and Stevenson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas J. Wise and the Pre-Restoration Drama Later in the fifties Foxon increased his public profile through a further and more dramatic encounter with T. J. Wise. In a letter to The Times of 18 October 1956 he revealed that Wise had been sophisticating his own books with leaves stolen from copies in the British Museum Library. The extraordinary bibliographical authority Wise had assumed in the early years of the century had already been severely dented by John Carter and Graham Pollard in An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (London, 1934), but Foxon's researches revealed a different order of villainy. 18 Foxon's discovery came from his cataloguing the Ashley Library, and began with a typical small puzzle. Ben Jonson's The Case is Alter'd turned out to have four leaves at the end inlaid, with missing elements at the head and tail of each leaf restored in pen-and-ink facsimile. When Foxon checked the Museum's copies, one turned out to lack just those leaves, and to be cropped at head and tail. This set Foxon in search of stolen Museum leaves, first in the Ashley Library and then in the library Wise had helped assemble for John Henry Wrenn in Texas. After preliminary announcements in The Times and the TLS, the whole business was thoroughly examined in a short monograph, published as a supplement to the Bibliographical Society's publications in 1959. The results of the investigation were striking. In all, 206 leaves were stolen from the Museum's copies; 89 of them were found in Ashley copies and 60 in Wrenn copies; 15 more were suspected but the copies had not been examined. Of the 47 plays with missing leaves, 41 have had at least some of their leaves traced. Foxon's account is remarkably free from censoriousness. Wise's behaviour is studied with the same dispassionate interest that Foxon might have granted the practices of an eighteenth-century printer, and, significantly , with the same sense of historical perspective. The second section of the essay describes the turn-of-the-century patterns of behaviour that made Wise's frauds comparatively easy. There was a general willingness among collectors to make up plays with loose leaves that they might have lying around. Wise makes no secret of it; Gosse and Aitken accepted the practice without question; Wrenn makes no objection. Wise, however, took the practice to new lengths by developing a regular habit of exchanging leaves in his own copies for those in copies he was selling to Wrenn. Of course this confused the bibliographical evidence, and Foxon gives two nice examples of Wise discarding bibliographically valuable leaves because of their inferior appearance: The Ashley copy of Eastward Hoe, 1605, is the only recorded copy of the first issue of the first edition; yet because its title was cropped he exchanged it with that from the third edition . . . which he sold to Wrenn. Two copies of Ben Jonson's The Alchemist, 1612, were intermingled; in the course of this Wise discarded an unrecorded cancelland, no doubt because it had been slit as a reminder to the binder' (6). The first section of the essay demonstrates that Wise had taken this practice further by stealing leaves from the copies in the Museum. It sketches the conditions under which Wise would have had access to the books, and the lack of supervision so distinguished a figure would have enjoyed. Wise probably took the books home at night, removed the leaves, and returned them in the morning. Foxon calculates that the financial gains Wise would have made by the thefts bore no relation to the risk of discovery and disgrace: `clearly there are irrational motives at work which are beyond the scope of this enquiry' (5). The final section of the discussion turns to technical matters and the evidence for Wise's thefts. Wise made no attempt to match up watermarks or chain lines, and most of his made-up copies can be detected through absence of conjugacy. Evidence to identify a leaf with its source may come from a number of indicators: stab-holes (with a discussion of problems from refolding and binding); worm-holes and patterns of worm-holes; stains; and flaws (`foreign bodies', `ill-digested lumps', `wrinkles') which the binder presses into adjacent leaves. These forms of evidence then become the basis for the fascinating discussions that follow in the list of `Plays with Stolen Leaves'. Each entry gives the Greg reference number, the details of the missing leaves in the Museum copies, and the description of the Ashley and/or Wrenn copy. The information is presented economically, but the typical final line, ` Conclusion : The stolen leaf is in the Ashley copy', is thoroughly earned. This study is another venture involving collaborators—Fannie E. Ratchford, Emeritus Curator of the Wrenn Library, who travelled with the Wrenn books from Texas, is thanked with eleven other individuals— but the skill lay in the initial identification of the theft, the recognition of what further needed doing to advance the enquiry, and the martialling of the evidence in a particularly accessible and attractive form. Foxon himself says, The primary purpose of this study is to warn students of the early drama of specific made-up copies, and to reconstruct as far as possible their constituent parts. It should follow that other made-up copies will be found which will fill gaps in my reconstructions and bring to light stolen Museum leaves as yet untraced. But above all I hope that it may encourage bibliographers to cast a critical eye on the copies from which they are working so that they may not be led into error or waste of time by past sophistication. Given the importance of the British Museum Library as a source for texts of early drama, the first of these aims is an important one, but Thomas J. Wise and the Pre-Restoration Drama is also successful in giving readers a set of clear techniques for investigating sophisticated copies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Compiling English Verse, 1701-1750 By the time the Wise discoveries were in print, Foxon was launched on his catalogue of English verse. In the early fifties, after the publication of Donald Wing's short-title catalogue, 1641-1700 (New York, 1945-51), the Bibliographical Society had been considering the possibility of preparing a similar catalogue for the eighteenth century. A working-party was set up, under Harold Williams, to see whether the project should be taken further and Foxon took on the responsibility of estimating how many entries there might be. When it was decided not to go ahead with the proposed project, Foxon decided to embark on his own verse catalogue for the first half of the century. What he decided to aim at was `a short-title catalogue with frills' ( English Verse, 1701-1750, xi): something that offered more bibliographical information than STC and Wing, but less than Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (London, 1939-59). The project would give him more scope for bibliographical sophistication than his cataloguing at the Museum, and allow him to pursue his long-standing interest in the poetry of the period. As Foxon records in the preface to his catalogue, a stimulus for his work was Fredson Bowers's paper on his proposed bibliography of the Restoration drama, read to the Bibliographical Society on 18 November 1952. 19 `This lecture was my inspiration', he declared nearly twenty years later. 20 Foxon decided that, like Bowers, he would consult multiple copies, but that, whereas Bowers intended to use microfilms, he would use the position of signatures as a means of identification: The points that impressed me most were the number of unrecorded variants, issues, and even editions which could be found only by personal examination of multiple copies, and his argument that the more copies a bibliographer has examined, the more safely can his descriptions be condensed. It became clear to me that though my catalogue could not provide full bibliographical descriptions, any attempt to produce a reliable work must involve seeing as many copies as possible myself and not relying on published catalogues or other second-hand sources. As a check against concealed editions, reset sheets, and reissues I decided to adopt Falconer Madan's practice of recording the position of signature letters relative to the text above them, a method of identification I had already come to trust and one which was far cheaper and easier than the use of microfilm. ( English Verse, 1701-1750, vii) Although Foxon recognized the limited precision Madan's method gave him, he continued to value its economy and utility. Foxon's first task was to make a skeleton catalogue with pencil entries (including shelfmarks where available) in preparation for detailed information in ink when he had seen the copies. He used forms on pressure-sensitive pads of six slips each, ordered from the Stationery Office. The slips (8″ x 5″) consisted of eight central boxes (4 full-length and 4 half-length), with the borders forming larger boxes (1″ deep at the top, 1½″ wide at the side). In the centre top went the title; to the left the date; to the right the location. In the central division were recorded : imprint; collation; pagination; half-title, errata, frontispiece, advertisement, watermark, press-figures; ornaments; miscellaneous. The recording of first lines began later, proposed by someone during Foxon's stay at Harvard—he always regretted that he could not acknowledge his debt by naming the proposer. The top slip would be used to create the main entry in the catalogue, the five subsidiary slips to create the indexes. Foxon began his work by reading the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, before moving on to author-bibliographies and Dobell's poetry catalogues from before the War. He read in the BM Catalogue and visited the Bodleian at weekends to consult the catalogues there. An interest from the beginning was printer's ornaments, which in this period provide opportunities for printer identification. Foxon established a file of printer's ornaments, even though he found it difficult to get the quality of pictures he wanted, but it was soon clear that a photographic record of all printer's ornaments would be too expensive and cumbersome. During his period at Harvard in 1959, however , he had access to a Polaroid camera with close-up lens, which helped him to identify Edinburgh piracies in the period, piracies that had, for example, perplexed the bibliography of Pope. The files of these ornaments have been given to the National Library of Scotland. Serious work on examining books for the catalogue began only on a visit to North America from 1959 to 1961. For this Foxon applied for a Harkness Fellowship from the Commonwealth Fund. These annual awards enabled about thirty British men and women in their late twenties or early thirties (Foxon was a little old at thirty-six) to go to America for a year or more. The scheme was administered with personal and financial generosity. It provided around $300 a month, a rented car for six months (Foxon had a special arrangement for a year), and appropriate introductions. Foxon went for eighteen months, carrying his catalogue slips in a single large suitcase inherited from his father-in-law. Nominally he was at Harvard and Yale, but he managed to fit in many of America's scholarly libraries in his nine months of travel between the two. It was an exciting time to be in the States, coinciding with John Kennedy's nomination for the presidency, and Jane and Deborah came out to join Foxon for a three-month holiday. They met in Quebec and drove across America to California and back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Libertine Literature The return to the British Museum brought a sense of anti-climax. There was talk of Foxon's being given time to complete his catalogue, but it never materialized. Indeed, the next serious step towards completion was delayed until Foxon left the Museum in 1965. Nevertheless, this period saw the publication of four important articles in the Book Collector in 1963 as a result of the accidental discovery of an advertisement for The School of Venus, or the Lady's Delight in the Daily Advertiser for 25 August 1744. Foxon recognized this as a reference to L'École des Filles, a French pornographic work referred to in English literature but with no known English translation. The discovery that there had been a translation set off an enquiry into early English pornographic publications, their continental antecedents, and finally, in an article requested by John Hayward, the Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure and Fanny Hill. The essays were subsequently issued together as Libertine Literature in England, 1660-1745, and then published, with an introduction by Foxon, in the United States in 1965. This was a pioneering exercise in the scholarly history and bibliography of pornography, and one still referred to today. 21 Using legal records, advertisements, and bibliographical and literary analysis, Foxon was able to show the patterns of diffusion of the texts and estimate their potential importance as historical sources. Publication of articles on such a subject, even ones as scholarly as Foxon's, was still regarded as daring, and one distinguished bibliographer warned Foxon that it would ruin his career. But Foxon's period in psychoanalysis, and a short research visit to the Kinsey Institute during his time in the States, gave him confidence to pursue these intellectual puzzles like any others encountered in his work, and Hayward, who was the editor of Rochester, encouraged him. Publication was timely, for it coincided with the new freedom in sexuality recorded wistfully by Philip Larkin in his `Annus Mirabilis': Sexual intercourse began In nineteen sixty-three (Which was rather late for me)— Between the end of the Chatterley ban And the Beatles' first LP. 22 Although Foxon had no programme of liberation in mind, he was bibliography's representative in this historical shift, and the measured tone of his writing goes alongside a conviction that old hypocrisies must be blown away and new moral judgements made. In Libertine Literature Foxon interprets the advertisement for The School of Venus as a clue to a hidden vein of English culture. It had been assumed there had been no pornography in the seventeenth century , except for Rochester, and that the first legal proceedings had been against Curll in 1727. Foxon argues that, on the contrary, there had been rapid importation of French pornography and a willingness to risk prosecution. The first chapter is informed by his visits to the Public Record Office during his lunch hours and lists government actions against pornography from 1660 to 1745. He paints a lively picture of the trade in pornography by printers, publishers, and hawkers, with a particularly telling glimpse of the Brett family, who sent out their children to buy `The Complete Set of the Charts of Merryland' and The School of Venus for selling on to customers, and of George Spavan, who made a guinea a week from sales of The School of Venus alone. The account of gentleman purchasers includes Pepys, Wycherley, Learnerd, and Ravenscroft, but perhaps the most amusing episode is the attempt of the gentlemen of All Souls to print Aretine's Postures at the University Press. Sadly for the young gentlemen, Dean Fell turned up unexpectedly and confiscated the prints and plates; about sixty prints had already been distributed `but Mr. Dean hath made them call them in again and commit them to the fire' (1964 edn., 7). from Aretine onwards, while the third, on Satyra Sotadica and Vénus dans le cloitre, examines a series of translations of the former, including a `sucker-trap' from that most respectable of booksellers, Jacob Tonson. In the final chapter, on Fanny Hill, Foxon tells the story of its prosecution , printing a letter from its author Cleland for the first time, and then, partly on the basis of ornament evidence, clarifies the bibliography of the early editions. He shows that the version with the sodomitical episode is the first, and it was on this understanding of the textual history that Peter Sabor was later to base his edition for Oxford University Press in 1985. The proposal in the late sixties that Foxon should himself edit the text for the Oxford Novels series was turned down on the grounds that the time was not yet ripe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">English Bibliographical Resources and Canada In 1965 Foxon left the British Museum to take up a post as professor of English at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. The Museum was not proving an encouraging environment for his work, and two Canadians , Kathleen Coburn and George Whalley, who had met him through their work on the Bollingen Coleridge edition, persuaded him to think of a move to Canada. Foxon's divorce had been finalized in 1963, and a new job in a new country had a self-evident appeal. He accepted a post in Whalley's department at Queen's, but before going to Canada he made a tour of British libraries in an attempt to draw his catalogue towards a conclusion by inspecting as many further copies as he could. Foxon could afford his British trip only because he had become involved in a facsimile-publishing enterprise. When he returned from the States in 1961, Foxon had brought back microfilm of a large number of broadsides, and his first thought was that it would be a good idea to publish them in facsimile. But attempts to get good quality photographic enlargements failed through lack of adequate equipment. Nevertheless, Foxon had become persuaded of the value of xerox reproduction during his time in America, and the arrival of the Museum's first proper machine in 1963 confirmed his view that a book could be reproduced well enough to provide publishable copy. He found that this view was shared by his Hampstead neighbour, Peter Elstob. Elstob was a man with an unusual and varied career: novelist, balloonist, recorder of the Spanish Civil War (in which he had fought), manager of the Arts Theatre Club, and secretary of International PEN. Elstob had been in touch with Gregg International of America about photolitho publishing, and, with Foxon's advice, the project emerged of publishing English Bibliographical Resources. There were three series: 1. Periodical lists of new publications; 2. Catalogues of books in circulation; 3. Printers' manuals. Foxon had discovered many of the facts about the editing and publishing of early book lists through his work on dating for his catalogue, and he had published some of the information in an article in The Library in 1963. These catalogues were now made available in facsimile and formed the basis of the first series. Foxon's role was that of editor; he found the materials and wrote the introductions. Gregg were responsible for production, and Elstob for sales. The series was offered for subscription, with considerable success, and Foxon's share of the subscription financed his tour of British and Irish libraries from March to August 1965. He worked through the Bodleian and Cambridge University libraries, the major Irish and Scottish libraries, and as many provincial libraries as he could, especially hoping to find locally printed materials. Though he left for Canada with no thought of returning, Foxon's stay there was short. He relished the informality of Canada—returning to Oxford, he found it formal and stuffy by contrast—and he enjoyed both his teaching and the social life of the department at Queen's. The post in North America made him eligible to apply for a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he was successful in being given an award for 1967-68, spending the time in Oxford preparing English Verse for publication. During this period the Readership in Textual Criticism became vacant (it was perhaps the only post that would have tempted Foxon to return to Britain); he applied and was appointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oxford, English Verse, and the Lyell Lectures Foxon's teaching time in Oxford was divided between giving general lectures and classes to postgraduate students and supervising research. The informal role of general bibliographical adviser to the University— and, of course, to interested visitors—which had been filled by Herbert Davis, and would have suited Foxon, was not available to him because he was not given space in the Bodleian. There were probably several reasons for this decision. Davis (Reader in Textual Criticism 1949-60) had been succeeded by Alice Walker (1961-68), who had worked to a different pattern. Foxon was not a printer as Davis had been, and he did not, therefore, teach printing classes, as Davis had done (Michael Turner had already taken over that role), and the Bibliography Room, which had been Davis's headquarters, had passed back fully into the control of the Library. Unlike Davis, Foxon was elected to a college fellowship, at Wadham, but Wadham did not give him a room. His teaching room was behind the English Faculty Library, next to the Territorial Army headquarters. As I recollect, he used it very little, preferring to see his students at home or take them to the pub. Whatever the reasons for not encouraging Foxon to make his headquarters in the Bodleian, I have little doubt that the decision played a significant part in his growing isolation in Oxford. From the start, he was semi-detached from the University. Foxon struck students and faculty alike, I think, as a touch sophisticated and cosmopolitan for Oxford. He dressed smartly while others were dedicated to ancient tweed and leather patches; he liked French food and wine; and his cigarette holder, though eminently practical, smacked of London clubland in an earlier age. The sophisticated exterior was sometimes disrupted by extraordinary bursts of energy; if there were stairs available, Foxon would run up and down them. David Fleeman remembered a first meeting at the British Museum Library during which Foxon leapt up and ran across a table, disrupting its pile of papers, in order to collect a relevant curiosity. Foxon was a lively lecturer and an enthusiastic supervisor. At times I could have wished him less enthusiastic, because he would happily rewrite paragraph after paragraph of my prose; but mine may have been an especially dire case. Isobel Grundy remembers an endearing habit of trying to lift his head from his shoulders by the hair and exclaiming, `Boy, have you got problems !', something we both found reassuring. He was passionately interested in music, and, like Fredson Bowers, created a sophisticated audio system. Always determined to get warm and musical results, he endlessly tweaked his equipment and experimented with new units. To the distress of his advisers, however, he refused to part with his elderly Quod electrostatic speakers, which were fastened to the wall to reduce vibration , and took up enough space to make his sitting room look more like a radio station or cricket nets than a place for relaxation. In 1975 Foxon finally published English Verse, 1701-1750: A Catalogue of Separately Printed Poems with Notes on Contemporary Collected Editions. He had succeeded in his aim, prompted by Bowers, of consulting multiple copies and discriminating variant printings. Although he decided to restrict his listings for each item in the printed catalogue to five locations in Britain and five in the States, he made it clear that further information would be available to enquiring scholars . 23 (The provision of shelfmarks for British Library copies has led to his name being blessed by at least one perplexed user of its catalogues.) Other important bibliographical information is provided: titles and summaries of imprints, collations (an important advance over other short catalogues), notes of watermarks, dates of publication, information from printers' records, and, of course, discrimination of editions, impressions , and states. Foxon suggests in his preface that users might become impatient of notes such as `apparently a reimpression' or `sheet B is apparently reset' and acknowledges that they come from the method of recording the position of signature letters rather than using facsimiles (vii). But he regarded the method as appropriate to his time and resources . With his interest in developing technology, and particularly in the Hinman collator, he recognized that modern techniques of reproduction and collation would have permitted him to be more decisive in his judgements, but I think most readers would concur with his verdict that the method served him well. The quality of the discrimination in cases such as the bibliography of Pope's Dunciad or Essay on Man is astonishingly high. His results may be developed or refined by bibliographers of single poets or poems, but it is difficult to imagine more being encompassed by a single scholar in the time he had available. Foxon's opposition to quasi-facsimile transcriptions of title pages, defended in his Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), has proved controversial. His doubts about traditional practices had two sources. One was the development of technology , which made it possible to xerox title pages and then compare them mechanically. As he notes in his catalogue, only this comparison could reveal whether the type pages have been removed from the forme between impressions. In other words, the bibliographer can now carry out and summarize analyses that cannot be made available for the reader's replication by possession of the bibliography. The second reason for challenging the usefulness of title-page transcription was that it was very rarely successful in discriminating editions. Reviewing, and praising , Philip Gaskell's Bibliography of the Foulis Press in 1965, Foxon remarks on how large the title page transcriptions loom and notes the danger that a false emphasis on the title page can lead to variants being distinguished by a comma there, rather than by the fact that a preface occupies two pages rather than one. By providing a history of some of the practices of bibliographical description, Foxon was drawing attention to a ritual observance of received practice, and his challenge has not, I believe, been fully answered. A characteristically thoughtful response from G. Thomas Tanselle, however, defended quasi-facsimile transcription as an essential part of the historical account of the book, and I share his sense that title pages have an importance that goes beyond their ability to discriminate editions. 24 English Verse, 1701-1750 shows a characteristic respect for its material and concern for its users. His thoroughly humane approach was singled out for praise by G. S. Rousseau in a review that captures the quality of Foxon's work: English Verse 1701-1750, whatever else it may be, is certainly a work in the great tradition of English humanism. Foxon gives every evidence of familiarity with each of the approximately ten thousand poems catalogued here . . . Then [there are] the abundant signs of fine taste and common sense that are manifest, and, finally, the less sublime but nonetheless necessary `humanism' that must have gone into the dozens of small decisions—maybe hundreds— regarding this detail or that aspect of layout, this or that solution when faced with difficult choices, to say nothing of the perseverance that is the superlative sign of individual effort. 25 Foxon certainly attended to those small decisions that might benefit his users. In 1965, he published `Defoe: A Specimen of a Catalogue of English Verse, 1701-1750' in The Library, `to provide an opportunity for criticism at a stage when it can be constructively used' (277). If there were no major modifications resulting from this exercise, Foxon had already shown himself open to advice about his catalogue and willing to change his mind. As noted above, he had not originally intended to include first lines, but gladly did so when the suggestion was put to him, and the introduction to the specimen in The Library points to another change: `I originally intended to say nothing about the subject-matter of the poems, but it became clear that when I did know the person or event concerned it was silly to exclude it, even if I could not undertake the work of identification in every case' (277). For all its lightness of touch, I suspect this sentence is Foxon's way of conveying one of his profoundest insights: that his was essentially a humanist activity and that helpfulness to critics and historians was more important than consistency . Careful consideration of the user is also apparent in the preface and introduction, and in the six indexes of the second volume (first lines, chronological, imprints, bibliographical notabilia, descriptive epithets, subject). The preface and introduction are object lessons in the art of combining scholarly information with personal intimacy. Foxon's account of his work is Johnsonian. He is amusingly self-critical, but he puts before us standards of excellence we know cannot be attained. As a result, the reader not only feels in touch with the compiler but comes away with a proper understanding of what the catalogue can and cannot do. Foxon's catalogue has had the anticipated success with librarians, booksellers, and collectors—`not in Foxon' is a rare but important description—but it has also had less easily anticipated literary consequences . Roger Lonsdale's heroic labours in reading eighteenth-century verse for his ground-breaking New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse (Oxford, 1984) began by treating English Verse, 1701-1750 as a reading list, and Andrew Carpenter has confessed a similar debt in compiling his Verse in English from Eighteenth-Century Ireland (Cork, 1998). In this respect the catalogue has helped to revolutionize our understanding of eighteenth-century poetry. 26 The long period of preparing the catalogue for publication tired and debilitated Foxon. In his preface he explains that the actual compilation of his slips was much the easier part of his task. Organizing and polishing the material took eight years, and occupied most of the period of his Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967-68. I saw Foxon often in 197172 , when the catalogue had started to go through the press (I checked the proofs of the index of imprints for him), and know that he found the stress of the work overwhelming. The indexes were difficult to order, and proof correction was a complex and laborious task. He was also at this time taking various medicines that seemed to complicate or aggravate his condition. He himself dated a decline in his health from this period, dividing his life into before and after the publication of English Verse, 1701-1750. Preparation of the catalogue completed, Foxon launched immediately , and perhaps unwisely, on another important project. In 1974-75 he took up a fellowship at the Clark Library in California to prepare the Lyell lectures on Pope, which he was to deliver in Oxford in March 1976. The Clark proved an excellent place to work—Foxon always said that the lectures were completed only because he was looked after so well—and he worked under intense pressure, with extraordinary bursts of energy. When they were delivered, the lectures were an immediate success. Nicolas Barker gave a good account of them in the TLS, 3 September 1976, 1085, pointing out that much of their impact came from their illustrations. Foxon combined direct illustrations of imprints and advertisements with ingenious parallel texts constructed of Pope's drafts and editions. The final lecture, which has not been published, used some astonishing pictures of typographical innovations practised by authors. I have no wish to criticize the yeoman efforts of the editor who brought the lectures to publication in 1991, but there can be little doubt that some of the original force of the lectures is lost in their transition into print. 27 Foxon had himself considered revising and printing the lectures as a landscape book, with pictures to the left and text to the right, but such a project would have involved significant rewriting. In the lectures Foxon is the first to tell the full story of Pope's relation with printers and publishers, and to consider the consequences for editing. As Brean Hammond has recently pointed out, Pope's stance was usually that of an opponent of professional writing, but the Lyell lectures showed the full extent of his own professionalism as a writer. 28 If Pope was not a fraud like Wise, he was certainly an ingenious manipulator of booksellers and readers. Foxon is pleasantly ruthless in exposing him, while, as usual, avoiding a censorious tone. The skilled uses of anonymity, the wily business deals, and the taste for equivocation are all detailed, and the detective work is characteristically accurate. The chapter on the Homer translations, with its analysis of Pope's aesthetic choices and debts, and its reconstruction of the unfortunate Lintot's business problems, is a tour de force unequalled in discursive bibliography . Pope knew how books were printed and how they were marketed : he ruled the printer down to fixing the size of an initial letter, and he did his best to block out the publishing middle men and take a larger share of the profits. He was also the opposite of the author conceived by simplified versions of the Greg rationale of copy-text—one who wrote his text and then abandoned it to the printer. He intervened at every stage and shaped his text himself. Although Foxon was exhausted by this outburst of activity, he carried on working. In 1977-78 he was Sandars Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge and lectured on the Stamp Act and its consequences. In writing the lectures he drew on generous assistance from Richard Goulden, then in the Public Record Office but later to move to the British Library to help with the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue . These lectures remain unpublished, but copies were deposited in the Cambridge University and British libraries. In 1978 Foxon was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in recognition of his eminence in refining the methodology of enumerative and descriptive bibliography , and in 1980-81 he was president of the Bibliographical Society. His presidential address to the Society, `Proofs as Evidence of Change in the Seventeenth-Century Printing House', provided an excellent introduction to the whole topic of proof-correction and used Plantin's ordinances of 1564 as a basis for discussing the timetable likely to be used in the printing house. Although he was encouraged, by Don McKenzie among others, to publish this paper, he declined to do so. In 1982 he retired from his Readership on grounds of ill health.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Postlude Foxon told me late in life that he had never anticipated so long a retirement, and in retrospect his abandonment of his research seems premature. In particular, he decided not to continue work on an edition of the Stationers' Register, 1710-1746, a project he had conceived before going to Canada and to which he was uniquely suited. His proposal had been accepted by the Bibliographical Society and some preliminary work had been done on copying the entries onto slips, but the prospect of undertaking another complex work of annotation and indexing was too daunting. By the time of his retirement Foxon thought of himself as a sick man, and, having largely given up conventional medicine, he sought relief in osteopathy and acupuncture. There can be little doubt that by this point he seriously underestimated his own powers, both intellectual and physical. He believed that treatment of his hypertension with beta-blockers on his return from America in 1975 had resulted in severe memory loss, but, although he may have suffered some impairment , my many scholarly conversations with him over the years convinced me that his memory was still strong—certainly usually better than my own. He played a very large role as a consultant in the preparation of his Lyell lectures for the press from 1987 to 1991, recalling in detail some of his original intentions, and in the late 1990s he still had the capacity to conjure up events, characters, and ideas from his early life. 29 For a time Foxon attended various committees of which he was a member, including the British Academy's, and he would regularly attend the Lyell lectures. He took pleasure in the honours he was given. He was awarded the Bibliographical Society's gold medal in 1985 and was delighted to be elected as Honorary Member of the Bibliographical Society of America the following year. He continued to offer assistance to scholars: Roger Lonsdale testifies to his helpfulness with particular queries in relation to the New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse, and Steven Shankman thanks him for answering detailed questions for the Penguin edition of the Iliad (1996). But though he would be happy to correspond with Lonsdale, a scholar he much admired, and to chat with him if he met him in the street, he was always unwilling to set up longer meetings. He regularly declined my suggestions that he should meet interested Popeians, through a false sense of his declining powers. Inevitably Foxon's life narrowed in these circumstances. As Isabel Fleeman remarked, `Someone who has to be in bed by eight o'clock is not a promising dinner guest'. He was on good terms with his neighbours , enjoyed visits to his daughter and her family, tinkered with his stereo, read The Times every day, and was still capable of a short private correspondence if something caught his interest in the TLS. He looked back on his life with pleasure tinged by perplexity. He became ill early in 2001 and died in a nursing home in London on 5 June. Foxon's life, in spite of persistent ill health and the valetudinarian impulses that overtook it, displays high ambition, independent intelligence , and courage to triumph over persistent difficulties. His achievement must be seen against the background of a British academic establishment that valued scholarly research (Foxon always enjoyed the respect of his superiors and his colleagues) but did little actively to support it. The major awards that enabled him to complete his work (the Harkness and Guggenheim Fellowships) were both American; he worked without a research assistant; he usually paid for his research travel and materials; and some of his most important work was carried out during his lunch breaks. He succeeded because bibliography was for him an exciting vocation, demanding a commitment not dissimilar to his father's devotion to his ministry. Bibliography required that the intellectual powers he had developed at Bletchley be dedicated to serving a wide community of critics, historians, librarians and collectors. That dedication lies behind Foxon's catalogue English Verse, 17011750 , but it also marked his work at the British Museum and at Oxford. He was always willing to approach the problems of other scholars with the same enthusiasm he brought to his own. To him answering queries was both a pleasure and a duty, an activity central to his scholarly role. And he never ceased to find the work exciting, perhaps too exciting. His curiosity was unresting, always seeking out patterns and anomalies, and trying to reconstruct the narratives behind them. 30 Foxon's legacy lies not only in the great resource of his catalogue and in the stories he uncovered of Pope and Wise and their machinations, but also in the possibility of future discoveries by the application of the same humane curiosity and technical know-how. He modestly took the epigraph for English Verse, 1701-1750 from Pope's Essay on Criticism: Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see, Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be. But his achievement is perhaps better reflected in the account of the ideal critic later in the same poem, which evokes a man like Foxon: Blest with a Taste exact, yet unconfin'd; A Knowledge both of Books and Humankind.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 David Fairweather Foxon, born 9 January 1923, died 5 June 2001. I am grateful to him for discussing his life and work with me in meetings we arranged in 1997 and 1998, though I first met him in 1970 and saw him regularly thereafter. Isabel Fleeman, the late David Fleeman, Isobel Grundy, Roger Lonsdale, Julian Roberts, Kathryn Sutherland, Michael Turner, and David Vander Meulen have generously shared their recollections of him with me at various times. 2 Austin was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Intelligence Corps and was awarded the Croix de Guerre at the end of the War; Foxon was a codebreaker at Bletchley Park. Austin was appointed White's Professor in 1952. His major publications are Philosophical Papers, ed. J. O. Urmson and G. J. Warnock, 2nd edn. (Oxford, 1970), How to Do Things with Words, ed. J. O. Urmson and Marina Sbisá (Oxford, 1962), and Sense and Sensibilia, ed. G. J. Warnock (Oxford, 1962). An entertaining account of a movement their opponents called `the Futilitarians' is given by Paul Grice in Philosophical Grounds of Rationality, ed. Richard E. Grandy and Richard Warner (Oxford, 1986), 49-59. The most important continuer of this tradition is Stanley Cavell; see Stephen Mulhall, Stanley Cavell: Philosophy's Recounting of the Ordinary (Oxford, 1994). 3 See John R. Searle, The Construction of Social Reality (London, 1995) for accounts of how physical objects acquire institutional status, a series of essays with considerable potential interest for bibliographers. For interesting play with meanings of `tympan', see Derrida's first essay to use columns of text in Marges de la philosophie (Paris, 1972), translated in A Derrida Reader: Between the Blinds (Hemel Hempstead, 1991), 146-168. I am grateful to the late D. F. McKenzie for drawing my attention to this essay. 4 In Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), Foxon says, `My fourth point you may consider somewhat emotional, but it is a concern that bibliography has cut itself off not only from educated men but also from many scholars . . . bibliographical writing would be better if the lay reader were more considered' (22-23). Full references to Foxon's publications are given in the list at the end of this essay; they are not repeated in the text or notes. 5 Fredson Bowers is sometimes representative of this tendency, though I would consider his general approach richly humanist. For Bowers's interest in scientific enquiry, see `Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems', Studies in Bibliography, 3 (195051) , 37-62, esp. 58; `Bibliography, Pure Bibliography, and Literary Studies', PBSA, 46 (1952), 186-208, esp. 208; and Bibliography and Textual Criticism (Oxford, 1964). For an impressive consideration of some of the issues, see G. Thomas Tanselle's `Bibliography and Science', Studies in Bibliography, 27 (1974), 55-89. 6 See G. Thomas Tanselle, `Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism', Studies in Bibliography, 49 (1996), 1-60. 7 Keith Graham, J. L. Austin: A Critique of Ordinary Language Philosophy (Hassocks, Sussex, 1977), 4. 8 See Gary Martin Best, Continuity and Change: A History of Kingswood School, 1748-1998 (n.p., ?1998). 9 See A. B. Sackett: A Memoir, ed. John Walsh (London, 1979). 10 Work at Bletchley, of course, had military consequences; it would have been incompatible with pacifism. I never fully explored Foxon's position with him. For a general account of Bletchley, see Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park, ed. F. H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp (Oxford, 1993). 11 See G. Thomas Tanselle, The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (Charlottesville, 1993), 33. 12 Julian Roberts, `David Fairweather Foxon, FBA—Demy 1946-48', Magdalen College Record 2001 (Oxford, 2001), 177-178 (177). See also the same writer's `David Foxon 19232001 ', The Library, 7th ser., 2 (2001), 395-397. 13 See R. J. Roberts's obituary notice, The Library, 6th ser., 11 (1989), 150-154. 14 The Rothschild Library: A Catalogue of Eighteenth-Century Printed Books and Manuscripts Found by Lord Rothschild, 2 vols. (Cambridge, 1954). 15 For further discussion of point-holes, see Foxon's `On Printing "At One Pull", and Distinguishing Impressions by Point-Holes', The Library (1956), 284-285. 16 `The First Title Page of Lyrical Ballads, 1798', Studies in Bibliography, 51 (1998), 230-240. I have only one disagreement with Reed. He says, `Having shown that neither the known Bristol-Longman title nor London-Arch title was printed as O 4 , he concludes—his conclusion is stated both with qualification (in various places) and absolutely (once)—that O 4 contained an earlier title page' (235). But (a) the sentence Reed quotes as absolute in his supporting note appears before Foxon shows Bristol-Longman was not O 4 , and (b) six lines after that sentence Foxon says, `I have followed the traditional view that the Bristol title-page was first, and assuming that Lyrical Ballads was printed in isolation have argued as if it had been printed as O 4 ' (227). That explains the status of Reed's quotation. Foxon always regards the `Cottle only' title page as a matter of speculation. 17 The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library: English Literature, 1475-1700 (New York, 1940). 18 Foxon liked Wilfred Partington's Thomas J. Wise in the Original Cloth: The Life and Record of the Forger of the Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets (London, 1946), which tells the story as it was known before Foxon's own discoveries. For subsequent reflections, see note 23. 19 `Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods', The Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 1-22. 20 In Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), 26. 21 See, for example, Randolph Trumbach, Sex and the Gender Revolution: Homosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London (Chicago, 1998) and Robert Purks Maccubbin, 'Tis Nature's Fault: Unauthorized Sexuality during the Enlightenment (Cambridge, 1985). 22 High Windows (London, 1974), 34. 23 Foxon emphasized the importance of identifying the whereabouts of copies in his review of Thomas J. Wise: Centenary Studies in The Library (1962), 263-264. 24 Tanselle summarizes his view in `Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942', in The Book Encompassed, ed. Peter Davidson (Cambridge, 1992), 24-36 (28). Further issues are explored in his `Title-Page Transcription and Signature Collation Reconsidered', Studies in Bibliography, 38 (1985), 45-81, which also discusses Foxon's Thoughts (50-52). 25 G. S. Rousseau, Review in The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography, n.s. 1 (for 1975), 7-9 (7). 26 English Verse, 1701-1750 had two excellent reviews which listed further items and copies: L. J. Harris, The Library, 5th ser., 31 (1976), 158-164, and James Woolley, Modern Philology, 75 (1977-78), 59-73. Woolley confirms Foxon's own suspicions that he missed items by going straight for the shelves and ignoring the catalogue when he visited a library—a strange choice for a cataloguer by profession. 27 I have no wish, either, to criticize Oxford University Press, where Frances Whistler did wonders in realizing the editor's intentions. Nicolas Barker had doubts about whether the lectures were publishable, and any conventional form of publication would have involved some compromise. Copies of the lectures were deposited in the Bodleian, British, Beinecke, and Clark libraries. 28 Brean S. Hammond, Professional Imaginative Writing in England, 1670-1740: Hackney for Bread (Oxford, 1997), 291-302. 29 Foxon was unable to read fiction in later life and complained to me of a decline in his capacity for feeling. In surveying his life, he also remarked that, although he had enjoyed his time at Kingswood School, he felt cut off from the life there, as though he had never really understood it. It has sometimes occurred to me that Foxon displayed in mild form some of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome, but, whatever the nature of his problems, his wonderful intelligence enabled him to combat them successfully, if at the cost of a final social exhaustion. 30 In a letter to David L. Vander Meulen of 29 May 1980 he described himself as `a pattern-seeking animal', adding that `it often pays off.'</field>

Warren Chappell designed as well as wrote the book, bringing to a focus his substantial experience as an illustrator and book designer. 2 The bold frontispiece includes, in calligraphy, the motto Figure 1. Calligraphic frontispiece, and title page, Warren Chappell, A Short History of the Printed Word (1970). "LITTERA SCRIPTA MANET," and below it, in print, an ascription and translation : "HORACE: The written word remains " (Figure 1). The motto appears as white letters against a black ground, but the image may have resulted from a photographic reversal of letters inscribed in black ink on a white ground. Though evidently not typeset but hand-designed, the lettering of this motto suggests not handwriting but the monumental qualities of Roman letters carved in stone. Because such inscriptions supplied printing in the West with its repertoire of capital letters, the motto speaks here for the virtue not only of handwriting (probably the original referent), but also of the printed word that succeeded handwriting in Western culture—as Chappell explained (20, 22), and with the results that he celebrated. In fact, the manual calligraphy of this frontispiece mimics (though with considerable freedom of layout) the capital letters of the metal typeface, Trajanus, which Chappell had designed more than thirty years earlier; and which, in its name, saluted Trajan's column in Rome (c. A.D. 114), the originary source of Roman capitals. 3 Chappell's frontispiece artfully mediates script and printing , making the same boastful claim for both: the written word remains. 4 Chappell credits the claim to Horace, but Horace did not write it. It will not be found in the standard concordance to Horace, nor in the electronic edition. 5 But the mistake is a motivated one; for Horace did write the famous, self-reflexive, self-fulfilling conclusion to his Odes, " [ e ] xegi monumentum aere perennius": I have finished a monument more lasting than bronze and loftier than the Pyramids' royal pile, one that no wasting rain, no furious north wind can destroy, or the countless chain of years and the ages' flight. I shall not altogether die, but a mighty part of me shall escape the death-goddess. 6 These written words have indeed remained, long surviving the poet, as he boasted they would. And that extraordinary boast became a literary common- place, renewed by Ovid, Spenser, Shakespeare, Herrick, and many others. 7 "Not marble, nor the guilded monument, / Of Princes shall out-liue this powrefull rime." 8 Only poetry remains to posterity. But the paradox of this poetic topic—that fragile writing, if well written, can outlast even monumental stone—is not really the point of Littera scripta manet. The earliest known formulation, apparently already proverbial as Adam Murimuth used it in his chronicle of the reign of Edward III, which he completed in 1347, is " Res audita perit, litera scripta manet." 9 Caxton used a similar formula when he introduced the phrase to print: "Vox audita perit / littera scripta manet." 10 The balanced maxim draws a contrast not between the considerable durability of stone and the even greater durability of writing, but between the dissipation, the instant loss, of the sounds of the spoken word, and the fixity and durability of the written word. That is, the contrast is not merely comparative ("writing lasts longer than a monument") but absolute, and all in the favor of writing. Several formulations insist on the same sharp contrast: "Litera scripta manet, verbum ut inane perit": "The written letter remains, as the empty word perishes." 11 "Littera scripta manet, volat irrevocabile verbum ": The written word remains, the spoken word flies away, not to be recalled. 12 " [ V ] ox emissa volat, litera scripta manet": "While words spoken may fly away and be forgotten, what is written remains as evidence." 13 It has been suggested that "litěra scripta manet" is "a portion of a mediæval pentameter." 14 Maybe; but it wasn't something that Horace wrote. The surfacing of this maxim in the late middle ages coincides with the consolidation of bureaucratic power by scribes and secretaries. As a kind of advertisement, the maxim promoted the careers of those who were invested in writing, not speech; it is easy to imagine why a scribe first wrote it down. Chappell translates littera scripta manet as "the written word remains," but the phrase is littera scripta, not verbum scriptum. Words are spoken before they are written; but letters come into being as they are inscribed, or printed, or electronically coded; and the adepts of writing technologies have always had a stake in their success. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Littera scripta manet was not one of the maxims that William Blackstone cited in his vastly influential treatise, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-69). 16 However, the topic had to interest him, because seventeenthcentury developments, particularly the Statute of Frauds (1677), tended in certain circumstances to privilege the written over the spoken word. In his discussion of the conveyance of property by deed, Blackstone briefly explains why that statute encouraged the parties involved to (as we now say) "put it in writing": Formerly many conveyances were made by parol, or word of mouth only, without writing; but this giving a handle to a variety of frauds, the statute 29 Car. II. c. 3 enacts , that no lease or estate in lands, tenements, or hereditaments [with certain exceptions] shall be looked upon as of greater force than a lease or estate at will; unless put in writing, and signed by the party granting, or his agent lawfully authorized in writing. 17 Given the fact that in certain circumstances a written conveyance or deed will trump any oral evidence, Blackstone must address the question what physical form such a deed has to take (aside from the question of procedural form, such as the necessity for appropriate tax-revenue stamps) in order to count as a valid deed. It is as if Blackstone were asking, What counts, formally, as littera scripta ? His remarkable answer, which emphasizes qualities of the substrate for writing, is informed by his reading of seventeenth-century treatises . Blackstone's attempt to rationalize the judicial practices that he found reported there has implications for twenty-first century understandings of littera scripta in the age of electronic text: [T]he deed must be written, or I presume printed; for it may be in any character or any language; but it must be upon paper, or parchment. For if it be written on stone, board, linen, leather, or the like, it is no deed. Wood or stone may be more durable, and linen less liable to rasures; but writing on paper or parchment unites in itself, more perfectly than any other way, both those desirable qualities: for there is nothing else so durable, and at the same time so little liable to alteration; nothing so secure from alteration, that is at the same time so durable. 18 Here Blackstone draws a crucial distinction between durability and security : both are desirable features of the written word, but they are at odds: one comes at the expense of the other; and the ideal medium for writing will maximize both. The substrate for writing must be durable because the distinctive advantage of writing over oral discourse is its durability: Littera scripta manet, vox audita perit. For writing to survive, the substrate must survive in stable form. 19 Writing is not really writing if it is (according to the classical watchword) "written on water." 20 Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), the abbot of Sponheim (Mainz, Germany), warned the monks in his scriptorium against the recent invention of printing, because it depended on paper, which he alleged to have a life-span much shorter than the thousand years he expected of parchment . But in fact the kind of paper that Blackstone and his judicial predecessors knew, which was made of linen or cotton fiber or a mix of both, proved to be about as sturdy and durable as parchment—certainly much more durable than the kind, made of acidic wood pulp, that came into use after 1850, which sometimes has a life-span measured only in decades. 21 Besides durability, there must also be security against alteration. Though parol evidence can be fabricated, the witness can be interrogated directly as a check against that. Now writing, as Socrates famously complained, is silent under examination. 22 Still, absent its author, a deed must be scrutinized to determine its authenticity—its freedom from alteration and sophistication. Fortunately, the more fragile the document, the more evident the tampering: the most secure document is the least durable. According to Blackstone, the ideal substrate would reconcile the competing demands of security and durability ; it would be sufficiently fragile to betray tampering readily, but sufficiently durable to secure the permanence of the text. Paper and parchment are two such media, and so the law requires that deeds be written on paper or parchment, and not some other substrate. 23 Such is Blackstone's logic—his rationalization of the common law as he received it. In practice that law may not have been so rational; and of the two authorities that Blackstone cites only one engages the problem. The New Natura Brevium of Anthony Fitz-Herbert (1470-1538), which appeared in numerous editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, exerted a lasting influence on legal practice and scholarship. In the relevant passage Fitz-Herbert merely discredits purported contracts that had been written on wooden tally-sticks—standard devices for accounting, but not, by legal custom , a legitimate medium for inscribing contracts: If a Man make a Tally, and make Bond thereupon, and seal and deliver it as his Deed, yet it shall not bind him, but he may plead against the same, that he owed him nothing , or wage his Law. For an Obligation ought to be made in Writing in Parchment or Paper, and not written upon any Piece of Wood, as a Tally is. 24 A marginal note cites several cases as precedents, but no explanation of the particulars is attempted. Edward Coke (1552-1634), Blackstone's most important predecessor, drew up a larger list of proscribed substrates. He also mentioned a partial rationale: the need to forestall "alteration or corruption." [A Deed] ought to be in Parchment or in Paper. For if a writing bee made upon a peece of wood, or upon a peece of Linnen, or in the barke of a tree, or on a stone, or the like, &amp;c. and the same bee sealed or delivered, yet it is no Deed, for a Deed must bee written eyther in Parchment or Paper as before is said, for the writing upon these is least subject to alteration or corruption. 25 Now "stone" is unacceptable. Why? Certainly stone is durable enough. The problem must be that it lacks the requisite fragility; that is, a fragility that would betray any effort to tamper with the inscription. Presumably Coke imagines the discredited writing to be deposited upon the surface of the stone, not incised below the surface: for incised writing would show signs of tampering readily enough, but superficial writing could be altered without damaging the stone—without leaving a trace. This question will come up again. Later commentators have not been much impressed by Blackstone's efforts to rationalize the tradition as he received it. Actually, there have not been many later commentators on this passage. The first of these, the comic writer Gilbert à Beckett, a staff writer for Punch, reduces this passage, along with the rest of Blackstone's Commentaries, to a froth of punning inanity. In The Comic Blackstone (illustrated by George Cruikshank—who ignored this passage), à Beckett stipulates that the third necessary characteristic of a deed is that [a] deed must be on paper or parchment, for it has been decided to be no deed if it be written on stone, board, linen, or leather. So that an indenture cannot be made with the sole of a man's foot, though it has been done on the sands at Ramsgate. Such an indenture is not however binding, and it is liable to be quashed or squashed, when Neptune enters upon his usual roll, which he does about breakfast time. A deed is not good on linen, but we have seen a cotton conveyance, when property, such as a pound of cherries, has been passed from one boy to another in a pocket-handkerchief. 26 More in earnest, the American jurist C. G. Tiedeman found Blackstone's comments to be merely advisory in any case, and nonsensical in the case of stone or metal: There can be no objection in principle to a deed written on cloth or on unprepared skins of animals, so long as the writing remains unobliterated. And the reason [i.e., Blackstone's double rationale of durability and security] fails altogether if the writing is carved on stone or engraved on metal. 27 Which would be true, if the stone were carved—and not written upon. But I suppose that Blackstone, like Coke, objects to stone—for example, a piece of slate—that has been written upon, not incised; for such superficial writing might indeed be altered without leaving an apparent trace of the alteration. Even writing upon parchment is more secure than writing upon stone; for though ink can be scraped away from the surface of parchment, it will usually leave a visible trace there. It is pertinent that in the paragraph quoted above Blackstone shifts the predication of durability from the substrate to the "writing on" the substrate. It is not enough for the substrate, the ground of writing, to endure; the writing itself must endure, along with its ground. The writing as perceived exists as a figure against the ground; to endure, it must stand in a secure relation to that ground. That is, it must be indelible —literally, undestroyable. Though stone is durable, writing upon it is often not indelible. Writing with ink upon ordinary paper usually makes indelible marks. Tiedeman notes that the question is one that has not "[met] with any positive adjudication," though Blackstone's preference for parchment or paper has become "the accepted opinion of all the courts and treatise-writers." 28 The easy availability of paper in the modern era would present few challenges to such an opinion. However, the postmodern displacement of paper by electronic media offers a new challenge. Is a virtual deed a deed indeed? Or is a deed writ on electrons like one writ on water? 29 Whatever the legal outcome to such questions, Blackstone's analysis can help guide our thinking about their implications.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Despite the easy analogy of electrons and water, and despite anecdotal lore about obsolescent electronic texts, which die if they happen to survive the only machines that can read them, 30 the main problem with electronic text is not the problem of durability. For there are two different routes to durability : the durability of the particular inscription, or the replicability of the inscribed text. Blackstone almost encounters this distinction when he remarks that "the deed must be written, or I presume printed." Printing, being a technology that can readily replicate a text, can give it durability of a second kind, beyond the durability of any particular inscription. After all, the boasts of Horace, Ovid, and Shakespeare were fulfilled not because their holograph manuscripts "remained"—they did not—but because they were copied, first in manuscript and eventually by print, which greatly multiplied the number of copies and so hedged against the loss of any copy. Important early English manuscript documents were, as we say now, "backed up"—that is, copied onto multiple parchments and deposited in multiple archives. 31 Durability can be copy-ability. Of course, copies may vary in accuracy, making textual criticism both possible and necessary. Electronic text makes copying extraordinarily easy and potentially of much greater accuracy than any manual or print process. Despite its wimpy, insubstantial appearance, electronic text passes the first of Blackstone's tests. Even, or perhaps especially, in its electronic form, littera scripta manet. Replicating like an electronic virus, the stuff is actually very hard to expunge, as many a bureaucrat or newsgroup participant has learned with regret. The main problem with electronic text has to do with the second of Blackstone's requisites: that is, the security of the letter—its security against tampering. Not that letters written or printed on paper or parchment cannot be tampered with or forged: they are not always what they represent themselves to be. Nonetheless, such forgeries and alterations often show: under more or less ordinary scrutiny they may be seen for what they are. Albert S. Osborn (1858-1956), a forensic expert who was celebrated for his skill in the detection of document tampering, once described the process of detection in terms that recall Blackstone's reliance for security on the fragility of paper and parchment, and that also amount to practical advice to l'homme moyen sensuel, the ordinary person possessed of ordinary senses, and ordinary common sense: Alteration and tampering would be made much more difficult if all business forms that pass from hand to hand should be printed on dry, very smooth and perfectly white calendered paper, not of the highest quality, with an ample field of pure white paper surface above and below the amount line. Calendered paper, like ordinary foolscap, is made smooth by pressure as it runs between heavy rolls. This operation compresses and smooths the sheet and the slightest disturbance of the surface of any kind is easily seen. The application of water, or any fluid, swells the paper and destroys the uniformity of the surface and is easily discovered. Abrasion erasures also are very apparent on this paper and it is impossible to erase even pencil writing from paper of this kind without destroying the sheen or reflective quality of the paper when the erasure is made. . . . an erasure of this kind is seen at once by holding the paper so that the surface reflects light to the eye. The disturbed portion will not reflect the same as undisturbed portions. The banker or business man should select the paper upon which checks and drafts are to be printed and not meekly accept whatever paper and design is [sic] offered to him. 32 Such was the world of writing on paper—a world not free of suspicions, but a world nonetheless in which you might expect to find your suspicions confirmed or disconfirmed: simply look and see. 33 The new world of writing with electrons prompts a stronger misgiving: the fear that one can never see for oneself whether the written word that persistently remains (assuming that it does) is the word it was supposed to be, or is, rather, an invisible imposture. Several years ago David Bearman, a consultant who had held administrative positions in the Office of Information Resource Management at The Smithsonian Institution, prepared a brief introduction to such problems, titled "Archiving and Authenticity." Published online in 1995 as part of a symposium, it reappeared, revised, the following year as part of a paper document issued by the Getty Art History Information Program, a collection of articles titled Research Agenda for Networked Cultural Heritage. The online edition was withdrawn in 1999, but the paper edition fortunately survives. Bearman's comments are at least as pertinent now as they were in 1995: The proliferation of electronic information and communication systems has created a crisis of accountability and evidence. As more and more of the records of our society are available in electronic form, users are asking how they can be sure electronic records created in the past will be available in the future and how they can be sure those received today are trustworthy. The issue is critical for all aspects of humanistic studies because these scholarly disciplines depend on the study of original texts, images, and multimedia sources. To even imagine the humanities, it is essential to have correct attribution, certainty of authenticity, and the ability to view sources many decades or centuries after they are created. 34 Bearman's logic is consistent with the "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records," published by the Modern Language Association of America in 1995, which argues the need to preserve for "future study . . . texts that appeared in the past in handwritten or printed form on paper or parchment." Such material embodiments provide essential information about the history of the text in question, including the history of its consumption as well as of its production. "If we approach the electronic future with these thoughts in mind," the report urges, "we will be more rigorous in our demands of new forms of textual presentation and more vigilant in our protection of the artifacts embodying the old forms. Both these actions are necessary to ensure the continuation of productive reading, teaching, and scholarship." 35</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Texts written in analog media are naturally auto-historical: that is, whatever their putative referent, they carry more or less legible traces of the history of their being inscribed, a history which can be understood in relation to the history of other events. In that respect such texts are like stone, which has its place in the geologic record. But texts written in digital bits are essentially ahistorical: as an ephemeral patterning of electrons they lack a fixed relation to any historical moment. They are like water. In Walter Benjamin's terms, they renounce the "aura" of historical authenticity in favor of an easy access afforded by the perfect, fungible reproduction. 36 Electronic text is naturally synchronic; and only the artifice of experts can authenticate it by binding it to the history of passing moments, through such devices as "digital timestamping " based upon "hashing" the code. 37 If in principle the fear of forgery, of electronically cooked books, is a reasonable fear, in practice most people don't give it much thought, because they leave it to the experts to worry about. And there have always been experts , custodians of our concerns, in positions of power over our understandings and our welfare. Illiterate monarchs 38 had to trust literate secretaries, who practiced their craft in secret; and ordinary people rely on the arcane verbal skills of lawyers and accountants. The computer technicians who would guarantee, with secret and invisible code, the authenticity and freedom-fromtampering of our electronic documents, do not have a categorically greater power than such bureaucrats. 39 But the scale of control is different, and the thralldom of a king to his clerk may be less disturbing politically than the dependency of millions on the document-security systems and assurances of a few. In the era of electronic writing, both of Blackstone's textual criteria— durability and security—can be satisfied, but only by entrusting a new secretariat of digital experts. What they do and how they do it will be a mystery: their guild will be a mystery; and that will be the source of their power. 40 On 30 June 2000 President Clinton advanced electronic commerce in the United States by signing the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. 7001). He signed the bill twice, once by passing a signature card over a scanner (an act confirmed by his keyboarding his password , "Buddy"—after his dog), and then again by inscribing his name on paper with a felt pen. 41 This law took effect on 1 October 2000. It provides, "with respect to any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce ," that a signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and . . . a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation. 42 "[W]ills, codicils, or testamentary trusts" are specifically exempted from the operation of this law, as are certain other documents (468). The law leaves it to federal or state regulators "to specify performance standards to assure accuracy , record integrity, and accessibility of records"—without, however, " requir[ing] use of a particular type of software or hardware" (470). The terms "accuracy" and "record integrity" conceivably overlap each other, and so do not square precisely with Blackstone's concepts of durability and security. They are not among the terms explained in the Definitions section of the act. "Record integrity" presumably includes security against malicious alteration, as well as against casual decay; and accuracy presupposes a kind of self-identity and durability; so both of Blackstone's criteria remain in play. However, in the electronic domain there is no reason to foreground them by opposing them, as Blackstone does in the material domain: durability and security are not at odds in cyberspace, where threats to durability and security arrive from all sides. The E-Sign Act (to call it by its user-friendly nickname) favors no particular medium: like Faust in his indifference to paper, parchment, brass, or stone, the new law is open to using any tool at hand: whatever works, so long as it is electronic. "The term `electronic signature ' means"—very broadly—"an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record" (422). This openness to possibility, this refusal to specify a narrow formal and technical definition of what will count as an electronic signature, is consistent with the long-standing informality of the law of signatures in Great Britain and the United States. In this respect law differs from lore. Despite common lore, often enforced by clerks, about the need to conform recognizably to one's so-called "legal signature" (a lay concept without legal standing), one can put one's name to paper in any form—and indeed not only one's name but any graphic symbol at all—in an indefinite number of ways: it will count as a signature, so long as it was affixed with the intent to sign. The longstanding Uniform Commercial Code defines the word "signed" so as to include "any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present intention to authenticate a writing." 43 The new definition of "electronic signature" is comparably broad. A key difference, though, is that under the old regime of paper a signer would know experientially, and could choose, how she was signing. Under the new, electronic regime, others, more expert, will know better and make the choice for her beforehand, and will afterwards determine whether she has in fact signed. The market, and the experts, will decide how we best will sign our names in electrons. Similarly for the construction of the electronic text or record as a whole: it will say what the experts assure. 44 When T. S. Eliot complimented John Donne for being "expert beyond experience" the preposition "beyond" marked an intensification. That is, Donne, "[w]ho found no substitute for sense, / To seize and clutch and penetrate ," experienced more than the ordinary person, and more thoroughly, but in the same modality, through physical "sense." 45 His expertise, though hyper-experience, beyond the limits of ordinary experience, was still something that he experienced. But the expertise of a postmodern technician is "beyond" experience in a simpler, less rigorous way: it deals with a disembodied reality inaccessible to and unassessable by the laity. 46 The problem is one of scale—"proper magnitude," as Aristotle explained in a different context: we can directly assess only what is not too large or too small. 47 Superstrings of galaxies and strings of DNA are alike outsized and beyond experience. 48 So are the carriers of bits and bytes. We must entrust them all to the experts. But don't we trust experts all the time? The reader who buys a copy of King Lear trusts that the editor prepared the text in an expert way—if she thinks about the question at all. (If not, the trust lies even deeper.) The patient who accepts her physician's prescription trusts that it was framed with appropriate expertise. Furthemore, the facts and principles that inform both disciplines (textual criticism, medicine) are more or less available, should one care to investigate them: the reader can learn enough about the text of King Lear to second-guess her editor, or the patient can learn enough about her ailment and treatment to provide "informed consent." 49 Is the case not the same with electronic text? It is true that a producer or consumer of electronic text can educate herself in the mysteries that would guarantee its authenticity, as a general matter . But she will hardly be in a position to examine the coded electronic arrangements that would secure a given transaction. Concerning the particulars she must take much on faith. And to participate at all she will have no choice in the matter, for the expertise of electronic experts is now a cultural given, not an option. Contrast the expertise of the "handwriting expert," or "examiner of questioned documents," which over a century ago gained prestige and authority in courts of law. 50 On Jennifer Mnookin's analysis, testimonial expertise in the identification of handwriting has been, if not quite a legal fiction, a judicial construct; furthermore, recent decisions leave its future very much in doubt. 51 That is, the expertise of the handwriting expert is contingent, not necessary: courts can make do without it. But it is impossible to imagine secure electronic inscription without imagining also the supervision (direct or indirect) of an electronic expert, whose procedures and actions are beyond ordinary inspection. "Believe one who experienced it": " experto credite, " urged Diomedes, who had personally experienced combat against the hero of the Aeneid (11.283). We, however, must believe our new secretary, the electronic expert, not for what she has experienced, which we cannot assess, but for her credentials , which we can, more or less. 52 Such essential trust, circular, would probably have disquieted Blackstone, an expert of the old school; but now, in the new millennium, regarding littera scripta, there is no alternative to it. I've presented versions of this argument to several academic conferences over the last few years, and the reception has varied in instructive ways. 53 Sometimes objections have been raised to Blackstone's ideologically suspect preoccupation with questions of authority and property. However, once there was a quick, impatient response from a law professor who is expert in internet law. Though I can only paraphrase his response, the gist of what he said is clear in memory: "You don't have to worry," he said; "trust us."</field>

But Horace was boasting of what he had written. 7 Ovid, Metamorphoses, trans. Frank Justus Miller, Loeb Classical Library, 2 vols. (1916; rpt. London: Heinemann, 1966), 226-227 (15.871-879).

"[P]owrefull rime" does not specify written poetry (it might be oral); however , the last line of sonnet 65 does so specify, in expressing the poet's desire "[t]hat in black inck my loue may still shine bright." 9 Adam Murimuth, Continuatio chronicarum, published together with Robert de Avesbury , De Gestis mirabilibus regis Edwardi Tertii, ed. Edward Maunde Thompson (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1889), 3: " Quoniam, ut scribitur per antiquos, `Res audita perit, litera scripta manet, ' . . ." Murimuth invokes the maxim at the very outset of his chronicle as a justification for bothering to write it; however, his authorities for the maxim— ut scribitur per antiquos, "as is written by the ancients"—remain obscure. The spelling litera, less correct by classical standards than littera, was common in medieval Latin. I owe thanks to George Sheets, Wolfgang Mieder, Tom Hill, F. R. P. Akehurst, and Dennis Lien for helping me find early instances of this formula. Katherine Hedin and Professor Sheets also gave me helpful advice on several legal details. 10 William Caxton, prologue to The Mirrour of the World (1481); The Prologues and Epilogues of William Caxton, ed.

Jones, A Translation of All the Greek, Latin, Italian and French Quotations Which Occur in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Also in the Notes of Various Editions (Philadelphia: Johnson, 1905). Nonetheless , at least by the nineteenth century the maxim had become a regular part of legal discourse ; see note 13 above. In 1804 the Supreme Court heard the maxim quoted by an attorney , who cited the principle that "written evidence is in its nature of superior weight to mere parol testimony, for verba volant, litera scripta manet; words barely spoken are fleeting, but when written become permanent" ( Church v. Hubbart, 6 U.S. 187, 203). See also James Wigram, A Treatise on Extrinsic Evidence in Aid of the Interpretation of Wills, ed. John P. O'Hara (New York: Baker, 1872), 49: "The law holds out a bounty on the reducing of contracts to writing by precluding the adduction of parol evidence in such cases. If extrinsic evidence was freely admitted, the utility of a written instrument would be greatly curtailed, while the defects and errors of memory would be substituted for the permanent litera scripta." Blackstone does not mention that early in the eighteenth century the Worshipful Company of Scriveners of London, who were chiefly responsible for preparing legal documents, revised their armorial bearings to include the motto LITTERA SCRIPTA MANET—instead of the motto SCRIBITE SCIENTES, which had figured there from early in the seventeenth century. (Later yet, the original motto was restored.) See John Bromley, The Armorial Bearings of the Guilds of London (London: Warne, 1960), 217 and plate 45; and Francis W. Steer, A History of the Worshipful Company of Scriveners of London (London: Phillimore, 1973), 49. I thank David L. Vander Meulen for bringing this fact to my attention. 17 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, ed. A. W. Brian Simpson , 4 vols. (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1979), 2: 297 (2.20.2).

Aside from two punctuation variants, this passage appears unchanged in the ninth edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, 4 vols. (London, 1783; rpt. New York: Garland, 1978), 2: 297. Blackstone died in 1780. 19 Reviewing the early history of the loss of Greek literary texts, many of which perished along with the papyri on which they were written, F. M. Hall observes that "[t]he great losses . . . occurred in all probability before the papyrus roll was finally superseded in the fifth century A.D. by the parchment codex. With the invention of a practically indestructible form of book, literature was no longer at the mercy of the material upon which it was written, and was not necessarily doomed to extinction during a period of neglect." A Companion to Classical Texts (Oxford: Clarendon, 1913), 42. 20 "What a woman says to her ardent lover should be written in wind and running water"; Catullus, Carmina 70: 3, cited by John Bartlett, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 17th ed., ed. Justin Kaplan (Boston: Little, 2002), 93. Compare Ivan Illich and Barry Sanders, ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind (San Francisco, CA: North Point, 1988), 27: they report a Latin commonplace according to which "memory is a signet ring leaving its impression on wax," and they cite a related comment in Aristotle, De Memoria et reminiscentia : "Some men in the presence of considerable stimulus cannot remember owing to disease or age, just as if a stylus or a seal were impressed on flowing water" (450bl-4). The best-known instance is Keats's self-authored epitaph, solidly and indelibly inscribed on his tombstone: "Here lies one whose name was writ in water." Aileen Ward, John Keats: The Making of a Poet (New York: Viking, 1963), 400, 405-406; Oonagh Lahr, "Greek Sources of `Writ in Water,' " Keats-Shelley Journal 21-22 (1972), 17-18. 21 Elizabeth L. Eisenstein implies that Trithemius was misled by "the topos which had first set durable parchment against perishable papyrus"; The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: Communications and Cultural Transformations in Early-Modern Europe (Cambridge : Cambridge UP, 1980), 14. Regarding the durability of paper see Dard Hunter, Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, 2nd ed. (New York: Knopf, 1978), 309; also, Jutta ReedScott , Preserving Research Collections: A Collaboration between Librarians and Scholars (Washington, DC: Association of Research Libraries et al., 1999: "Paper made from cotton fiber has lasted for more than a thousand years, preservation microfilm can have a life expectancy of hundreds of years, woodpulp newspaper pages deteriorate within decades, and some types of computer disks show loss of information after a few years" (5). Cases vary, however, especially depending on storage conditions; in Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper (New York: Random, 2001), Nicholson Baker describes and illustrates newspapers made from wood pulp that have survived a century or more without disintegrating (5, 17; illustrations between 212 and 213). 22 The Collected Dialogues of Plato, ed. Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns, Bollingen Series 71 (New York: Pantheon, 1961), 521 ( Phaedrus 275d). Socrates makes a similar objection to (oral) poetry in Protagoras, 347e (340). 23 Though Blackstone confirmed a materialist view of the identity of a deed, holding paper or parchment to be essential to the document, in another legal arena he helped to construct an idealist concept of the copyrightable work of literature, according to which "[t]he paper and print are merely accidents, which serve as vehicles to convey . . . style and sentiment to a distance"—"style and sentiment" being deemed "the essentials of a literary composition." See Mark Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright (Cambridge , MA: Harvard UP, 1993), 89, quoting from English Reports 96: 189. Blackstone's differential insistence on and indifference to the materiality of the text is only apparently paradoxical. A deed exists as a unique exemplar, whereas a published work exists in multiple copies, which are themselves often copied. 24 Anthony Fitz-Herbert, New Natura Brevium, ed. Matthew Hale (London, 1730), 283 (sec. 122.I).

The reference to "unprepared skins of animals" contrasts to parchment, which is specially prepared sheepskin or goatskin. 28 Tiedeman, quoted by Lewis, 756 n. 13. Gerald Dworkin summarizes the requirements for a deed in brisk terms that recall Blackstone: "A document is some writing which furnishes evidence or information about something. All deeds are documents, but not all documents are deeds. For instance, a legend chalked on a brick wall, or a writing tattooed on a sailor's back may be documents but they are not deeds. A deed is, therefore, a particular kind of document. It must be a writing and a writing on paper or its like, e.g., vellum or parchment. . . . `Writing' includes print." Gerald Dworkin, Odgers' Construction of Deeds and Statutes, 5th ed. (London: Sweet, 1967), 1. The formal requirements of a will are more relaxed. The Wills Act 1837 required, among other things, that a will be "in writing," but it did not specify any substrate. In a well-known case, Hodson v. Barnes (1926), the court entertained the claim that "writing on the shell of a hen's egg" was a proper will. In this case it decided, absent corroborating evidence , that the writing was only a memorandum, not a will. However, "[i]t was not difficult to conceive a state of facts in which unquestionably it would be a testamentary document"; for example, if the testator "had handed the eggshell over to a custodian to be put in a secret place." Times Law Reports 43 (1926): 71, 72. 29 In "From Written Record to Memory in the Law of Wills," Ottawa Law Review 29 (1997-98): 39-61, Nicholas Kasirer examines the equivocal implications of a probate case in Quebec, Re Rioux, which involved a purported will encoded on a computer diskette, and a paper printout generated from it. 30 Stephen Manes, "Time and Technology Threaten Digital Archives," New York Times Apr. 7, 1998, F4.

Osborn, Questioned Documents, 2nd ed. (Albany, NY: Boyd, 1929), 543. Questioned Documents was the leading twentieth-century treatise in the field of forensic document examination. Despite judicial misgivings that prevailed up to the end of the nineteenth century, Osborn helped to establish that field as a "science" (displacing the feebler pretensions of graphology), and he became increasingly influential in the courts as an expert witness. Skepticism about the field has re-emerged only in recent decades. For an account of Osborn's rhetorical skills, which made the most of an uncertain enterprise by catering to judicial needs and stressing ocular demonstration, see Jennifer L. Mnookin, "Scripting Expertise: The History of Handwriting Identification Evidence and the Judicial Construction of Reliability," Virginia Law Review 87 (2001): 1723-1845, especially 1757-60, 1814-29. 33 Kasirer, in "From Written Record to Memory in the Law of Wills," expresses some impatience with "conventional definitions of writings as visible, touchable entities and of signatures as inky, human marks," and with the privileging of "[t]he ability to see the will with the human eye, unassisted by technology" (59, 57). Compare the concerns expressed by Eugene F. Provenzo, Jr., "The Electronic Panopticon: Censorship, Control, and Indoctrination in a Post-Typographic Culture," Literacy Online: The Promise (and Peril) of Reading and Writing with Computers, ed. Myron C. Tuman (Pittsburgh: U of Pittsburgh P, 1992): "The ability to alter the past has always been potentially possible in analog culture. It has tended, however, to be enormously time-consuming and relatively easy to detect. . . . The alteration of photographic data by digital techniques represents a major problem in terms of the integrity of historical documents, and the extent to which we can trust the information from such sources in the future" (174, 179). 34 David Bearman, "Archiving and Authenticity," Research Agenda for Networked Cultural Heritage, ed.

Harry Zohn, ed. Hannah Arendt (New York: Schocken, 1969), 221: "the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition. By making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence." Benjamin was familiar only with imperfect, analog copies: his argument applies even more strictly to digital reproductions of digital texts, which are indistinguishable from originals. See Robert O. McClintock, "Marking the Second Frontier," Teachers College Record 89 (1988): 348: "Copies, in the familiar analog realm are costly to make and at best approximate , leaving clear traces of what is the original and what is the copy. In the digital realm, copies are nearly costless, [and] they are often indistinguishable from the original. . . ." 37 Graham, Intellectual Preservation, 3. 38 "[A]n illiterate king is a crowned Ass"—so Fulk the Good, Count of Anjou (d. c. 960), is said to have disparaged King Louis IV of France; see The Plantagenet Chronicles, ed.

He envisions, ultimately, a national panel of experts: "The . . . issue of who should determine whether a security procedure qualifies under the relevant standards is . . . a difficult one. Ideally, a national or international accrediting body comprised of scientists or information security experts might come into existence and develop standards for security procedures in electronic commerce" (843). In the meantime he recommends relying on a state-level "administrative agency," which would "employ experts necessary to evaluate the procedure [and] take advantage of the knowledge in the information security industry" (844). Kasirer dryly remarks that "[t]he technological dimension of creating digital signatures, involving a mix of computer science and applied mathematics called cryptography, is happily not beyond the understanding of all lawyers" ("From Written Record," 57 n. 82). He recommends, as providing "better explanations than those of the present author," a paper by N. S. Bender, "Digital Commerce and the Utah Digital Signature Act" (no longer available at the internet address that Kasirer gives, nor elsewhere online); and Sunny Handa and Marc Branchaud, "Re-Evaluating Proposals for a Public Key Infrastructure," Law/Technology 29:3 (1996): 1-26.

Eliot, "Whispers of Immortality," Collected Poems, 1909-1962 (New York: Harcourt, 1963), 45: "Donne, I suppose, was such another / Who found no substitute for sense, / To seize and clutch and penetrate; / Expert beyond experience, / He knew the anguish of the marrow / The ague of the skeleton. . . ." 46 Following up on some suggestive remarks by Jean Baudrillard about the relation between the "tactile" and the "digital" ( Simulations [New York: Semiotext(e), 1983], 115), George P. Landow has identified "a single defining characteristic of the digital word" to be the fact that, "[u]nlike all previous forms of textuality, the digital word is virtual, not physical" ("Twenty Minutes into the Future; or, How Are We Moving Beyond the Book?", in The Future of the Book, ed. Geoffrey Nunberg [Berkeley: U of California P, 1997], 215; see also Landow, Hypertext 19). In describing the consequences of this basic categorical shift Landow does not assess the mystification—and professional realignment—that it entails. 47 Aristotle's Poetics, trans. Leon Golden, ed. O. B. Hardison, Jr. (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice, 1968), 11, 14-15 (chs. 6, 7). 48 Writing half a century before Blackstone, Joseph Addison drew attention to "the proper Limits, as well as the Defectiveness, of our Imagination; how it is confined to a very small Quantity of Space, and immediately stopt in its Operations, when it endeavours to take in any thing that is very great, or very little. . . . The Object is too big for our Capacity, when we would comprehend the Circumference of a World, and dwindles into nothing, when we endeavor after the Idea of an Atome." Addison speculates that "this Defect of Imagination may not be in the Soul it self, but as it acts in Conjunction with the Body." Spectator 420 (2 July 1712); The Spectator, ed. Donald F. Bond, 5 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1965), 3: 576-577. Bond cites precedents in Descartes and Hobbes (3: 576 n. 1). 49 Indeed, under current law, the physician is responsible for enabling such informed consent. For a comprehensive account of clinical and legal aspects see Ruth R. Faden and Tom L. Beauchamp, A History and Theory of Informed Consent (New York: Oxford UP, 1986). 50 The handwriting "expert" gained a distinct authority in common usage even before the courts recognized his claim to expertise. For a while the noun expert, which had meant, generally, "[o]ne whose special knowledge or skill causes him to be regarded as an authority; a specialist," acquired the particular meaning "one skilled in the study of handwritings" ( Oxford English Dictionary, sense 2.b., citing instances from 1858 to 1886). See also the controversial treatise The Handwriting of Junius Professionally Investigated by Mr. Charles Chabot, Expert (London: Murray, 1871). In the preface Edward Twistleton remarks that "he had occasion . . . to consult Mr. Chabot, the Expert"; and the note appended to Chabot's name details that "he has . . . during the last sixteen years exercised the profession of a general Expert in handwriting" (xii). 51 See note 32. The leading case is Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993), which threatens all the forensic "sciences" with touchstone questions that are supposed to characterize genuine modern sciences; such as "whether the theory or technique in question can be (and has been) tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication , its known or potential error rate and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation, and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community" (509 U.S. 579, 580). It is an open question whether handwriting examiners will be able to pass these tests of credibility. Fingerprint examiners are in a similar fix, though the outcome may differ; see Simon Cole, Suspect Indentities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2001), 284286 ; and Jennifer L. Mnookin, "Fingerprint Evidence in an Age of DNA Profiling," Brooklyn Law Review 67 (2001): 13-70. 52 "[T]he role of the expert remains socially contingent: what is judged is not so much the content of the evidence or advice, as the credibility and/or legitimacy of the person giving that evidence or advice; if we trust the expert, we trust their expertise."

      <field name="heading_text">THOUGHTS ON THE AUTHENTICITY OF ELECTRONIC TEXTS by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ease with which electronic files may be altered has caused many people to contrast what they see as the "fixity" of printed texts with the " fluidity " of electronic texts. One writer who has resisted this superficial—indeed, inaccurate—pairing is Michael Hancher, whose essay entitled " Littera scripta manet: Blackstone and Electronic Text" is founded on the recognition that texts on tangible surfaces have always been subject to alteration. What he hopes to show is that electronic texts are different in kind from previous forms of visible texts with regard to the detectability of tampering, and he concludes that in the electronic world we are at the mercy of experts in a way that was not the case before. This conclusion is, I believe, a manifestation of the tendency , common in these early electronic days, to imagine sharper breaks between the new and the old than actually exist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We must recognize, first of all, that the instability of texts results from actions by the original authorizing agents of texts (authors, publishers, and the like) as well as by persons not so authorized (some of whom, such as scholarly editors, do not have fraudulent intent). Making it progressively easier for people (authorized or not) to alter texts and produce clean copies of those altered texts has been the effect of the major developments over the centuries in the technologies for reproducing texts. When handwriting is the means used, a clean copy of a changed text usually requires a considerable amount of recopying. But a text in standing type can be changed by switching some pieces of type and printing a new sheet (a fact that early printers, with their continual stop-press corrections, took full advantage of); and the touching up of a photographic negative for use in offset printing or the cutting and pasting that may precede xerographic printing constitute still easier ways to produce clean, but altered, texts. The computer is the latest stage in this progression, for an electronic file can be changed by striking a few keys, and the resulting text may show no signs of what happened. Of course, alterations can be bungled in any of these processes, leaving obvious evidence, but in those cases the texts could not be called clean. The point is that altered clean texts have become more easily achievable over the years; the introduction of the computer has not, in this respect, caused anything different from what has resulted from previous technological innovations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All these developments, in fact, share a distinction from handwriting in that they involve a two-stage process: the forme of type, the negative for a photolithographic plate, the pasted-up document, and the electronic file are not what one finally reads, but rather intermediate objects from which the objects to be read are derived. Thus there are two stages where changes can be made: on the intermediate objects and on the final objects. If the change is made on the former, and made carefully, then the final objects give no hint that a change has been made; if it is made on the latter, the detectability of the change depends not only on the skill of the person making the change but also on the particular qualities of the paper or other surface employed and on the expertise of the person doing the investigating. In the case of electronic texts, there are several alternative kinds of final object, such as a printout, an activated screen (that of a desk terminal or hand-held device, for example), or a surface (like a wall) bearing a projected image—with the intermediate objects in these instances being the coded electronic files. The text on an activated screen or the projected text on a wall is not realistically subject to change by altering the surface itself, without leaving obvious damage; in this limited sense, electronically produced documents are more difficult to alter than texts produced by earlier methods. And when electronic texts take the form of printouts, their susceptibility to alteration is exactly the same as that of any other texts on a paper surface.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But people who like to emphasize the difference between electronic texts and all previous ones often mix the two stages. When they claim that electronic texts can be altered more easily, what they are usually comparing is the ease of altering an electronic file with the difficulty of altering a text that has been printed on a piece of paper. But the relevant comparison would be with switching pieces of type in a forme, altering a photographic negative, or pasting new words or passages over or between others for xerography, not with the attempt to change the text inked onto a piece of paper. It does not advance the cause of thinking about electronic texts to perpetuate this confusion . And the root of the confusion is probably the absurd notion that electronic texts, unlike all previous visible texts, are not physical. (Screens and walls, no less than printouts, are physical, as are the materials employed at the previous stage: how could they not be?)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Furthermore, the issue of authenticity requires that one distinguish textual authenticity from documentary authenticity; and it is worth noting, more explicitly than Hancher does, that the two parts of his title point in these two different directions. One tradition, represented by the phrase littera scripta manet and its many variations, holds simply that verbal statements put into visible form, where they can be read, are more reliable in the long run than oral renditions of them. But this enduring reliability does not depend on the survival of specific physical objects. In this line of thought, the words can be said to "remain" because there was believed to be a greater chance of their being copied accurately than of their being repeated orally without alteration. (This belief is not necessarily true, of course, but there is a tradition of thinking it to be true.) Blackstone, on the other hand, standing here for the legal tradition generally, focuses on the integrity of specific documents ; the text present on a given physical object is authentic in the documentary sense if it has not been altered in an unauthorized way. Since the physical object survives from a previous time, it is a reliable first-hand witness to the text placed on it at that time, so long as that text has not subsequently been altered by human action or damaged by the passage of time. Whereas in this tradition it is the physical object that takes one back to the authorizing agent, in the other tradition it is the words, the text abstracted from any one particular visible representation of it, that provides the link to a past moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Neither of these kinds of authenticity, however, guarantees correctness, in the sense of fidelity to what was intended. Obviously texts that are copied or reproduced in any way may contain differences from their source-texts as a result both of inadvertent errors and of deliberate changes. But even the unaltered texts of documents that were produced or supervised by their authors do not necessarily contain at every point what those authors intended. Among the causes are slips of the pen and overlooked typographical errors; and legal documents are not (and could not possibly be) immune from such problems. So a signed contract or will, despite its authenticity, may not be accurate, in the sense of carrying a fully intended text. These points would be the same regardless of whether the intention one is interested in is the author's, or the publisher's, or someone else's. The only way to try to locate an intended text is to pursue it by means of a critical evaluation of the documentary texts and other relevant evidence. And when a scholarly editor publishes a reconstruction of an intended text, that edition becomes another document in the reader's search.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Legal definitions of authenticity, whether the traditional ones designed for pre-electronic documents or the new ones now being devised for electronic documents, are irrelevant to the search for intended texts: textual instability cannot be controlled by fiat. Electronic texts are texts; and therefore we must be careful, when talking about the authenticity of electronic texts, not to confuse documentary authenticity with intention. But documentary authenticity is of course of vital importance, and we are properly concerned with how we can learn whether a given electronic text possesses it. Computer printouts, being one class of paper documents, pose no different problems from other kinds of handwritten or printed texts on paper. The physical analysis of manuscripts and printed sheets and books is a technical specialty, and most people have to rely on the verdict of experts in this regard, although if they had sufficient time and incentive they could learn to do the work themselves . The situation is the same regardless of whether the text was produced by pen and ink, inked type or plates, or ink affixed to paper by electrostatic or laser means—though of course some understanding of the underlying process in each case is relevant to the detection of what may have happened to the document after the inking was completed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If, instead of focusing on the authenticity of the inked text (the text of the document), one is concerned with the authenticity of the intermediate object from which that text derived, one may frequently discover that the object no longer exists. Stereotype plates or formes of type, for example, may very well not survive for direct examination; but bibliographers are nevertheless often able to determine, from clues in the printed text, some of the changes that those plates or formes underwent. As for electronic files, if the objects containing them exist, computer specialists may be able to uncover coded instructions that are relevant to assessing authenticity. Most readers are glad to leave the task to those specialists, as they leave the investigation of printing plates and formes to bibliographers, but they could learn to undertake their own investigation in either case if they wished. Some people have the idea that acquiring the requisite knowledge of computer processes is in an entirely different realm of difficulty from learning the techniques of bibliographical analysis; but that notion, being dependent on individual aptitudes and temperaments, is not true for everyone. Even if it were, the difference between the two situations would be only a matter of degree, of relative difficulty , and not a difference in kind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although anyone with sufficient aptitude and incentive can become an expert in anything, no one can be an expert in everything. Therefore everyone is often in the position of relying on others for expertise, and the question of how to evaluate expertise is a basic one for the conduct of life. The argument has been made that there is a fundamental difference between assessing experts' experience and evaluating their credentials and that most people have no choice but to do the latter when they need to judge electronic experts (whereas they are not so limited in relation to seemingly less complex fields). This point is ultimately meaningless. The mere fact that everyone is familiar with paper and ink, for example, or that many people imagine letterpress printing to be easy to understand, does not enable those people to judge a paleographer's or bibliographer's work on the basis of personal experience . If one shares an expert's experience, one is also an expert; otherwise one must inevitably evaluate credentials, whether the materials being dealt with are ordinary or esoteric. That the legal community has raised some doubts about the value of handwriting specialists but not about the necessity for computer experts reflects a failure of perception, not an essential distinction between the tasks undertaken by each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The implication that one can do without specialists when the material seems commonplace is anti-intellectual and anti-scholarly. All of us, not simply as scholars but as human beings, make decisions all the time about when to accept specialists' judgments and when not to. But questioning their conclusions does not mean that we can do without them. Knowledge advances through the work of specialists and through the process by which we decide in each case whether to build on their contributions or to reconsider and investigate them. Objects containing electronic texts are no different from other objects (artifactual or natural) as subjects for our evaluation. We need specialists to help us determine the status of all texts, however they were produced, just as we need them in other areas of life. There is nothing alarming in our reliance on experts, as long as it occurs in this critical spirit. Rather it is a sign of how we come to terms intelligently with the complexities that we face in every aspect of life.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">JOHN MANNINGHAM'S DIARY AND A LOST WHIT-SUNDAY SERMON BY LANCELOT ANDREWES by P. J. Klemp</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While studying law at the Middle Temple, John Manningham (c. 15751622) kept a diary that documented many events in London's court, theater, and pulpit for some sixteen months at the close of the Elizabethan age. He is well known as the main source of our information about Queen Elizabeth's final hours, a performance of Twelfth Night, and "Shakespeare's clever vanquishing of Burbage in their rival pursuit of a woman of easy virtue." 1 He also took notes from some twelve texts that he read as printed books or as manuscripts, including two Paradoxes by John Donne and two others possibly by him but which we know of only through the Diary. Less well known but equally valuable because they help us reconstruct specifics about the pulpit in 1602-03, the Diary 's records of more than fifty sermons that Manningham attended provide many quotations or paraphrases as well as details about when, where, and on what scriptural passages clergy preached. Although Manningham often returned to hear certain preachers, he left a record of hearing Lancelot Andrewes only once. But his account of that discourse on Whit-Sunday 1602 "At Westminster [by] Dr. Androes, Deane of that Churche" (fol. 21b) is especially significant, for it offers the only extant evidence of that sermon, one that has not been noted by any editor of Manningham or Andrewes or by any other student of preaching in early modern England. To determine the extent to which Manningham's record faithfully reflects Andrewes's actual sermon, I will examine a characteristic practice throughout Andrewes's work, the echoing of his own earlier writings, and consider both the presence and the implications of that phenomenon in the present case. I will then look at Manningham's techniques for making Diary entries and the reliability of his note-taking in order to assess how his procedures might have affected his report.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Andrewes's Lost Whit-Sunday Sermon On 23 May 1602, when Lancelot Andrewes preached at Westminster on John 16:7, John Manningham was in the audience. This Whit-Sunday sermon was delivered by a preacher who was at least as prominent as two others who receive considerable attention in the Diary, John Spenser, rector of St. Sepulchre's, Newgate, and John King, one of the Queen's chaplains and rector of St. Andrew, Holborn. Beginning in the 1580s, Andrewes had delivered hundreds of sermons, many at court, and hundreds of lectures. 2 In mid-1602, he was, as Manningham noted, Dean of Westminster, someone who had preached before the Queen on many occasions and who would deliver her funeral sermon less than a year later. 3 Andrewes's fortunes, which were to soar under King James, were already on the rise, so it is not surprising that Manningham took extensive notes—about 1,500 words covering six pages in his Diary (fols. 21b-24)—on a Pentecost sermon delivered by a highly regarded preacher. Contemporary listeners and modern scholars have long acknowledged that Andrewes quotes, paraphrases, and alludes to his own sermons. The contemporary court gossip John Chamberlain recognized the connection between Andrewes's 1621 Easter sermon and the one he preached the previous year, 4 and modern scholars refer to the echoes and repetitions that occur between canonical texts in XCVI Sermons (1629), recollections that are almost certainly based on the preacher's direct examination of a manuscript while preparing a new one. 5 However, by neglecting to look beyond XCVI Sermons —that is, by consistently overlooking manuscripts and posthumously printed texts attributed to Andrewes—scholars have underestimated the extent to which he echoes his own writing and failed to recognize some of the uses of this evidence when dealing with important textual questions, including those of authenticity or authorship. Attributed to Andrewes on the title page and in the Preface, ΑΠΟΣΟΑΣΜΑΤΙΑ SACRA; Or, A Collection of Posthumous and Orphan Lectures (1657) contains over one hundred lectures on every verse in Genesis 1-4 and a few other scriptural passages, all delivered at St. Paul's and St. Giles from 1590 to 1592 and 1598 to 1600. A number of the Orphan Lectures include quotations and paraphrases from other pieces in the volume, material that is sometimes echoed or repeated from a lecture delivered only a few days earlier. 6 Similarly in XCVI Sermons, the Orphan Lectures, and attributed lectures and sermons whose manuscripts are located in the Emmanuel College Library and Lambeth Palace Library—texts separated by a few years or even a full decade—clear echoes and repetitions appear in Andrewes's discussions of the "congruities" between a church and a sheep-fold, the journey of the Magi, the pain expressed in Lamentations 1:12, and the debate of the Four Daughters of God in Psalm 85:10-11. 7 As these examples illustrate, it would not be difficult to make a case for the authenticity of the various manuscripts and Orphan Lectures by developing an argument based on a suitably large number of parallels between the canonical XCVI Sermons and texts that are candidates for being accepted as authentic. Because Andrewes's practice of self-echoing is somewhat more extensive than previously thought, there are more opportunities to use this evidence to resolve questions of authorship or to determine the reliability of notes taken on a sermon. Although no printed version of Andrewes's 1602 Whit-Sunday sermon exists for purposes of comparison with Manningham's notes, one can begin to assess his account by examining various ideas, images, and words in a later Whit-Sunday sermon Andrewes preached, specifically one before King James at Windsor on 12 May 1611 that subsequently was printed in XCVI Sermons. Doing so in turn requires some sense of what that printed form represents. Contemporary evidence suggests a close similarity between the texts as they appeared in Andrewes's manuscripts, spoken words, and printed works. In the Epistle Dedicatorie to XCVI Sermons, editors William Laud and John Buckeridge explain not only that they follow King James I's mandate to print all of Andrewes's works that were complete but also that the full sermon notes which they are publishing are nearly identical to what his congregation actually heard: Your Majesty gave us a strict charge, that we should overlooke the Papers (as well Sermons as other Tractates ) of that Reverend and Worthie Prelate, and print all that we found perfect. There came to our hands a world of Sermon notes, but these came perfect. . . . as the Sermons were preached, so are they published. 8 John Sparrow's general description of preaching in Stuart England indicates that Andrewes's habits of composing, memorizing, and preaching were by no means unusual. The "approved method of preaching" in the first half of the seventeenth century "was to speak a sermon with as little dependence on manuscript as possible. Yet a sermon was not given ex tempore: the preacher when he entered the pulpit would have it in his head, and he might have copied it out in full." 9 In fact, so conscientious was Andrewes about creating a finished, polished manuscript that he could follow when speaking from the pulpit that on four occasions when he was too ill to preach, the texts were already fully prepared and, after his death, given to the printer so they could appear in XCVI Sermons in a final form identical to that of the other sermons in the volume. 10 Manuscript evidence from Andrewes's 1620 Easter sermon further demonstrates that what appeared in print in the 1629 collection is nearly identical to the manuscripts from which he preached and, as Andrewes's preeminent modern editor has explained and as I have argued elsewhere , to the words he spoke from the pulpit. 11 In the case of the 1611 WhitSunday sermon, no apparent textual irregularities or unusual historical cirsumstances cast doubt on the conclusion that the posthumously printed text in XCVI Sermons accurately reflects what he preached and thus can serve as a reliable basis for comparison with his sermon nine years earlier. Themes and wording in the published Whit-Sunday sermon of 1611 indicate that Andrewes was there revisiting the sermon Manningham heard in 1602. In 1611, Andrewes chooses an appropriate passage for the day, John 16:7, in which Christ calms his disciples by explaining that he departs so a " Comforter " may come, the same passage Manningham heard him explicate on 23 May 1602. Connecting Whit-Sunday, 1602, and the scriptural passage, according to Manningham's notes, Andrewes states: These words have reference to the feast which is celebrated this day: whereupon St. Augustine said, In verbo fuit promissio missionis, et in festo missio promissionis. (fol. 21b) When the 1611 sermon was printed in 1629, the text presents the same point in similar words: So that, between this Text and this Feast, there is that mutuall reference and reciprocation , that is, between promissio missionis, and missio promissionis. 12 Referring to 2 Timothy 4:10 in both sermons, Andrewes shows the relationship between Demas's defection from Paul and Christ's leaving his disciples: Manningham (1602): as Paule complayneth, . . . that Demas had forsaken him, would it not greive the disciples to [be] for saken by such a frend as Christ had bin unto them. . . . fol. 21b) Andrewes (1611): Not without some griefe, doth the Apostle recount, that even Demas was fallen of, and had forsaken Him. 2. And, if any friend; how much more, of such a friend, as CHRIST was to them? (629) That Christ makes the effort to explain his departure calls for praise in both sermons: Manningham (1602): Christ rendred a reason of his departure (though it be not requisit alwayes that governors should render a reason to their subjectes of all their commaundments. . . .) (fol. 22) Andrewes (1611): [Christ] even condescends to render them (though farr his inferiours) a reason of His going and comming; which (sure) He was no way bound to doe. (630) In 1602, Andrewes uses a lengthy observation to demonstrate the necessity for Christ's departure, an argument that he echoes in 1611: Manningham (1602): 1. Yf the Holy Ghost should have come downe while Christ was upon the earth, whatsoever the Holy Ghost should have done in his person would have bin ascribed to Christ. 2. He would have appeared to have bin sent from the Father alone. And soe it would not have bin so apparant that he proceeded from the Father and the Sonne bothe. 3. Expedient it was that Christ should depart from them, howe good soever his presence was unto them. Wee knowe that bread is the strength of mans hart, yet sometymes it may be expedient to fast: our bloud is the treasury of our lyfe, yet sometymes it is expedient to loose it; our eyesight is deare and precious unto us, yet sometymes it is expedient to sitt in a darke roome. . . . It is expedient that children which growe fond of their parentes should be weaned. (fol. 23) Andrewes (1611): if CHRIST had still remained and not gone His way, they [signs] would not well have been distinguished, and great odds have been ascribed to CHRIST. . . . For, He not going to send Him, but staying still heer, the sending of the Spirit would have been ascribed to the Father alone, as His sole act. This would have been the most: that the Father, for His sake, had sent Him; but he, as GOD, had had no honour of the sending. Being ascended and glorified, mittam will streight be conceived: Quem mittet Pater, et quem mittam a Patre; that with the Father, He sends Him, equally, and we alike beholden to them both. . . . as it is expedient, CHRIST withdraw Himselfe from them. And is there any vobis, can any man be in that case, it should be good for CHRIST to depart from him? It seemeth so. We see oftentime, the case so standeth, even in regard of this life, that, from some, it is good their meate be taken, and yet is meat the stay of their life; that, from some, it is good their bloud be taken, yet bloud is nature's treasure, and that holdeth us in life; that, from some, light be taken, in some disease of the eyes, yet is light the comfort of this life. . . . Even that case, that maketh the mother many times withdraw her selfe, from her yong child, whom (yet) she loveth full tenderly, when the child groweth foolishly fond of her. (633-634) Near the end of the Diary 's entry on this sermon, Andrewes uses striking imagery to present the application of his various points: Manningham (1602): The Holy Ghost is not given to all in the same measure, nor the same manner. When Christ breathed upon his disciples they received the Holy Ghost; and, when the Holy Ghost came like fyrey tongues, they were filled with him: breath was warme, but fyre is hotter: there was heate in both but not equally. Elias prayed that the Spirit of [Elijah] might be doubled upon him. (fol. 24) Andrewes (1611): And, because his [the Holy Ghost's] uses be many, his types are so. Water sometimes, sometimes fire: One while winde, one while ointment: and according to our severall wants, we send to him, for fire to warme; for winde, to coole; for water, to clense us; for oyle, to supple us. (636) These passages demonstrate Andrewes's ability to rework images and phrases to suit different emphases, the 1602 sermon focusing on the recipients of the Holy Ghost's power and how that power reveals itself, the 1611 sermon on the types or manifestations of the Holy Ghost. Quoted at length because they contain echoes and repetitions that are clear and numerous, these passages constitute some of the most compelling evidence that I have located from the point where Manningham's and Andrewes's lives intersect. As is the case with all of the pairs of quotations I have presented, and as I will now argue is typical of the Diary 's notes from various kinds of sources, the similarities between these passages about the Holy Ghost illustrate Manningham's skill at taking notes—in this case, while the preacher speaks—probably with some compression and summarizing. I will now turn to other evidence about his habits of transcription to assess further the nature of Manningham's notes on the 1602 Whit-Sunday sermon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Manningham's Note-Taking Techniques John Manningham's Diary, preserved as British Library MS Harleian 5353, covers the period from January 1602 to April 1603, its entries usually, but not always, appearing in chronological order. 13 Just as their contents range in subject matter from notable historical events to scandalous gossip and in source material from passages in printed texts and manuscripts Manningham read to transcripts, paraphrases, and summaries of parts of over fifty sermons he heard, so there is also a wide range in the quantity of notes he took when reading and listening. He copies a few sentences from Jacques Cappel's De Etymologiis Juris Civilis (1576; fol. 75), for example, but he uses hundreds of words to paraphrase "Some Partes out of" John Hayward's An Answer to the First Part of a Certaine Conference Concerning Svccession (1603; fols. 128b-132b). Similarly, he gives widely varying amounts of attention to different preachers, some of whom appear in brief but revealing sketches of their physical appearance, and their sermons, a few even receiving concise rhetorical analyses. 14 Although Manningham rarely inserts editorial comments about the sermons' doctrines or themes—he pauses once to remark that he heard "a strong continued invective against the Papistes and Jesuites" (fol. 79b)—his summaries, paraphrases, and sometimes extensive transcripts of various sermons' words allow us to experience what Robert Parker Sorlien , the Diary 's modern editor, calls their "oral quality: the distinctive tones and idiom of the preacher, together with something of the flavor of his personality." 15 In his study of English Pulpit Oratory, W. Fraser Mitchell offers one hypothesis about how Manningham compiled these notes in the Diary: "Its records of sermons are clearly written from memory day by day, and probably owe nothing to note-taking at the moment. . . ." 16 However, Manningham's purposes for making entries on sermons that he heard (insofar as we can infer those purposes), the extreme variations in their length, and the various kinds of fidelity to their sources—some are one sentence long, while others extend to many hundreds of words; some faithfully represent a preacher's thoughts while significantly deviating from his wording, and some follow both thoughts and words more closely—cast doubt on Mitchell's explanation. If we take into account the full range of notes contained in Manningham's Diary (taken from printed, manuscript, and oral sources, including not just sermons but also court gossip), Manningham seems to regard his manuscript both as a commonplace book that stores sententious phrases and brief summaries and as a notebook that records extensive statements and historical events. Accounting more carefully for the wide variety of notes contained in the Diary, Sorlien also rejects Mitchell's idea that these transcripts of sermons typically rely on Manningham's memory. Sorlien believes that the range in the length, style, and specificity of these notes is the result of using different transcribing techniques when the various preachers spoke: Manningham's note-taking methods seem to have varied. His full and detailed notes of Dr. John King's sermon at Paul's Cross in October 1602, for instance, suggest that he may have had his little book with him while listening; that is, he wrote in longhand on the spot; or if not, he took notes in some form of shorthand and later transcribed them. 17 Although Manningham's means of and purpose for taking notes affect the accuracy of the Diary 's records of sermons—and what we mean by accuracy— there is no evidence to suggest that he complicated matters by introducing the intermediate step of writing in shorthand. 18 Sorlien makes a far more convincing case when he argues that the diverse kinds of notes may be the result of another variable that is unrelated to writing in shorthand, the stature of a given preacher: Although ordinarily he [Manningham] was content merely to list the main heads of a sermon, on occasions when a star attraction like Dr. King or Dr. Spenser preached, he paraphrased and quoted extensively, writing down nearly everything he heard. 19 I will argue that almost all of Manningham's note-taking from printed books, manuscript texts, and spoken sermons occurs while he reads or hears a source. These notes may be long, his words roughly corresponding to the source's phrasing, imagery, citations, rhetorical flourishes, and so forth, or short, offering compressed yet remarkably precise and perceptive assertions of the source's main points. However, on one occasion when Manningham attempts to capture not just some of the phrasing or central ideas but also the poetic form of an epigram by John Donne, the nature of the deviations from the source—indeed, from the entire history of the text's transmission— strongly suggests that he is relying on his memory. An examination of the transcripts he makes from printed books and manuscripts that are directly before him provides a foundation for understanding the notes he takes in church when a preacher delivers an oral text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Manningham's Reliability as a Note-Taker When a preacher delivers a sermon during a church service, members of the congregation experience an oral phenomenon whose pace and subject matter they do not control. Note-takers in this setting cannot ask the preacher to slow down, repeat or skip material, discuss a different scriptural passage, or alter his exegetical stance; once they have decided whether to attend a church service, the note-takers' other choices include whether to stay, where to sit, and whether to pay attention, choices that affect listening comprehension and hence the auditors' notes. That certain aspects of a spoken sermon are beyond the auditor's control is evident from one of Manningham's experiences: In the after noone Mr. Marbury at the Temple: text, 21. Isay. 5 v. &amp;c. But I may not write what he said, for I could not heare him; he pronunces in manner of a common discourse. Wee may streache our eares to catch a word nowe and then, but he will not be at the paynes to strayne his voyce, that wee might gaine one sentence. (fol. 54b) Assessing the quality of note-taking abilities is anything but straightforward in the context of a church service because a preacher may speak extempore, using no written text with which we can compare the auditor's notes, he may revise his oral remarks when he later writes them down, or he may preach from a written text and then revise it before circulation or publication. 20 Compared to auditors, readers have more choice in the texts they digest and more influence over the pace at which they receive information and take notes. And if a reader's printed or manuscript sources are extant, we are in a good position to judge the notes' accuracy, a word used here in the sense of reproducing an argument's rhetorical touches, phrasing, and development (organization, use of evidence, logic, and so forth). With different variables surrounding the oral text and the printed or manuscript one, the more controlled reading environment therefore allows us to assess Manningham's accomplishments as a note-taker when he works directly—relying on only the momentary use of memory as he immediately transcribes material from a source into his Diary —from printed texts and manuscripts. Furthermore, we can readily compare some of his entries with the printed texts on which they are based and, when he takes notes on manuscripts or spoken sermons that are later printed, as is occasionally the case, we can also examine the relationship between the source and the notes. 21 (a) Printed Sources We can confidently consult the same editions of most of the eight printed books from which Manningham transcribes directly and usually extensively 22 A comparison of his notes with six of those sources reveals that his transcripts, like his notes on manuscripts range from exact quotations to summaries and loose paraphrases. 23 Manningham clearly works directly from his sources, presenting remarkably accurate passages, some extensive and some in Latin, when he gives excerpts from two of these printed texts. The Diary 's excerpts from Samuel Rowlands's Tis Merrie When Gossips Meete (1602) include about twenty lines of witty poetry, most containing the source's exact words: There's many deale upon the score for Wyne, When they should pay, forgett the Vintners Syne. (fol. 45) 24 From Thomas Stapleton's Orationes Academicæ, Miscellaneæ Triginta Qvatvor (1600), Manningham confidently reproduces complete passages wordfor-word : Si Deus justus et potens est, quae eius sacrosanctam religionem violant ab ipso vindicanda relinquii debent? Volet enim quia justus est, et poterit, quia potens. (fol. 63) 25 For reasons that are by no means clear—it would be difficult to locate two texts as divergent in theme, form, language, purpose, and audience as Tis Merrie When Gossips Meete and Orationes Academicæ —in these entries Manningham wished to keep a full and precise record of his sources. When Manningham takes notes from three other printed texts, his apparently different purposes lead to different results, as the need for selective notes about key points calls for abandoning word-for-word transcripts in favor of clear, concise summaries. Outlining what William Watson calls arguments for "tolleration for religion" in A Decacordon of Ten Qvodlibeticall Qvestions (1602), Manningham takes reliable, if selective, notes: Watson: First, he [Father Parsons] could not then haue any colour to set out bookes, or anticke shewes (as he hath) or to blaze it abroad in all nations, how cruell, tyrannicall , and inhumane the persecution of Catholikes is in England. Secondly, he could no longer after haue blowne the infamous blasts that course both sea and land, he affirming England to be the nurcery of faction, sedition, and of all mischiefe wrought throughout the world. . . . Thirdly, he could not by al likelihood haue had any Catholike Prince or other in Christendome to haue banded on his side. . . . Sixtly, his baits had bene worth nothing for enticing and alluring of any subiect to rebellion. . . . Seuenthly, this tolleration or liberty of cõscience, wold quite haue cut off two bloudy hopes, which Parsons hath in al his practises: to wit, aswel the indãgering of her Maiesties royall person. . . . 26 Manningham: His [Watson's] sp[ecia]ll argumentes for a tolleracion in relligion: 1. that yf a tolleracion were induced, then there should be noe collor to publishe bookes howe tyrannicall the persecution of Catholiks is. 2. Then England should not be called the nursery of faction. 3. Then the Spaniard should have noe Prince to band on his side. 6. The subjects would not be so fitt to be allured to rebellion. 7. The safety of hir Majesties person mutche procured. (fol. 14-14b) When Manningham turns to John Hayward's An Answer to the First Part of a Certaine Conference Concerning Svccession (1603), his précis mixes close paraphrases and exact quotations: Hayward: the parliament in England by Henrie the first; who in the sixteenth yeare of his raigne, called a councell of all the states of his realme at Salisburie, which our Historiographers do take for the first Parliament in England. 27 Manningham: In K. Henry the first tyme the 16[th] yeare of his raigne the first parliament in England. (fol. 130) Taking notes on Thomas Floyd's The Picture of a Perfit Common Wealth (1600), Manningham presents brief excerpts that significantly condense his source and freely deviate from its wording while remaining true to its sense: Floyd: Like as a battered or a crazed ship by letting in of water, not only drowneth her selfe, but all that are in her: so a king or a vitious tyrant, by vsing detestable enormities, destroyeth not himselfe alone, but all others beside that are vnder his gouernment. . . . 28 Manningham: A wicked king is like a crazed ship, which drownes both selfe and all that are in it. (fol. 6b) Similar to the excerpt from Hayward, this passage's length, compression, and wording suggest that Manningham's goal is to capture not a developed argument but a sententious simile. Two excerpts from William Warner's Albions England (1602 edition; fols. 54 and 60) give a clear idea of Manningham's different note-taking techniques even when he directly transcribes the same kind of material, rhymed couplets written in fourteeners. In these entries, his purpose is transparent— the Diary becomes a commonplace book for antifeminist themes—but the notes he produces take two different forms. In one entry, Manningham writes a précis, transforming Warner's verse to prose and altering the syntax, yet still capturing the significant word-play: Warner: For long agoe the Calendar of Women-Saints was filde, Fewe not to opportunitie, importunated, yeild. 29 Manningham: The callender of women saynts was full long agoe. That [there?] are soe fewe nowe that will not yield to opportunity, yf they be importuned. (fol. 60) In another excerpt, he retains this source's poetic form and syntax while introducing three substantive variations (which I have italicized) that suggest not misremembering over a period of time but rather minor carelessness ("doth" for "will" and "runnes" for "fals") and eye-skip that causes "Riuer" in the first line to reappear in place of "Currant" in approximately the same location in the second line: Warner: A Womans Loue is Riuer-like, which, stopt, will ouer-flow, But when the Currant finds no let it often fals too lowe. 30 Manningham: A Womans love is river-like, which stopt doth overflowe, But when the river finds noe lett, it often runnes too lowe. (fol. 60) These examples from Watson, Hayward, Floyd, and Warner contain none of the characteristics of notes that rely on medium- or long-term memory, such as misremembered words or phrases, muddied syntax, sentences or phrases blurred into one another, reorganized material, and ellipses where key information should appear. Instead, the respect that Manningham accords the substance of his printed sources when he paraphrases or summarizes them, as well as the fidelity with which he reproduces the printed words of such authors as Rowlands and Stapleton, indicates that these excerpts from printed sources were probably written while reading and with different purposes in mind. (b) Manuscript Sources In a few instances, the transcripts in Manningham's Diary are based on manuscript sources. These notes are significant in part because they sometimes offer tantalizing glimpses of his access to lines of manuscript traditions that are no longer extant. That they have vanished makes it difficult to assess Manningham's handling of them, obliging us to be cautious when judging these particular notes. One text that existed only in manuscript when Manningham copied directly from it in 1602 is Sir John Davies's The Lottery (fol. 95-95b). Because Davies had been at the Middle Temple about a decade before the diarist, Manningham's ability to gain access to this document, like those containing works by Donne, points to a circle of friends associated with the legal profession who shared manuscripts that were indirectly transmitted from authorial sources. Extant in Francis Davison's 1608 edition of A Poetical Rhapsodie and in a manuscript in the Conway Papers, Davies's Lottery is made up of introductory matter in verse and prose followed by a series of couplets, each of which accompanied one of the "lots," small gifts distributed during an entertainment given by the Lord Keeper, Sir Thomas Egerton, when Queen Elizabeth visited Harefield House in the summer of 1602. 31 Many of the sixteen couplets that Manningham copies reproduce readings found in A Poetical Rhapsodie or the Conway Papers Manuscript or both. When the printed text and that manuscript present different readings, however, Manningham never agrees with A Poetical Rhapsodie; he sides with the Conway Papers Manuscript on about six occasions; on another handful of occasions, the Diary provides independent readings that agree with neither text and probably represent minor errors. 32 One example will suffice to illustrate the relationship among these texts: Poetical Rhapsodie: Fortune these gloues to you in challenge sends For that you loue not fooles that are her frends. Conway Papers: Fortũe these gloves in double challeng sendes For you hate fooles and flatterers her beste frendes. 33 Manningham: Fortune these gloves in double challenge sends For you hate fooles &amp; flatterers hir best frends. (fol. 95) Because Manningham reproduces both his source's wording and its iambic pentameter couplet form throughout an extensive excerpt, the transcript avoids the characteristic signs of relying on medium- or long-term memory. Rather, it appears that he was consulting his source when he made an accurate transcript of a lost manuscript that is closely related to the one contained in the Conway Papers rather than the one that Francis Davison used as the source for A Poetical Rhapsodie. Manningham takes more extensive notes on the manuscript of another text with a murky textual history, The Legend of Mary, Queen of Scots, attributed to Thomas Wenman (fols. 91b-94b). The poem's nineteenth-century editor, Jon Fry, writes that the manuscript is dated 1601 but provides no information about its location. 34 Since I have been unable to trace this manuscript and I can therefore compare Manningham's notes only with Fry's nineteenth-century edition, it is difficult to measure their accuracy. Not only do the two texts' numerous substantive variants indicate that Manningham's source is a different manuscript but they are also generally unhelpful in determining which, if either, might be accurate and which in error. The following quotations are from the Diary; italics identify the substantive differences with Fry's edition, whose readings appear in brackets. In terms of syntax, diction, and meter, some of Manningham's excerpts are clumsy: I might bemoane the hap that fell [ befalne ] to me That yet in [ in my ] grave must still accused bee. (fol. 91b) But other excerpts are somewhat superior and may more faithfully represent the source: They [ Who ] gave us courage quarrels to pretend Gainst [ Againste our ] neighbours Kings &amp; friends [omitted] for whom of right Our interest and [ of ] bloud would [ shoulde ] wish us fight. (fol. 91b) 35 While these excerpts from the Diary do not appear to be based on memory, they may suggest either that Manningham smoothed out material that he found awkward (a practice he does not engage in elsewhere) or more likely that he copied directly from his source and followed it with care. Manningham's Diary contains material from John Donne's Paradoxes, yet another text with a confused history of transmission, beginning when it was written in the 1590s and continuing beyond its first publication in his Juvenilia in 1633. Many manuscripts of the Paradoxes were circulated, particularly in the early seventeenth century, 36 making it difficult to determine where the one that Manningham consulted is located in the various lines of transmission. As a result, we must exercise caution when gauging the accuracy of his transcript. Manningham and Donne had many mutual friends who probably exchanged manuscripts, 37 and most of the readings in Manningham's transcript of Paradoxes 2 and 10 (fol. 101-101b) are supported by their appearance in other manuscripts of these texts, as well as in the 1633 printed edition. 38 In the following entry from the Diary, I have used italics to identify the substantive variants with Donne's Juvenilia, whose readings appear in brackets: That paynting is lawefull [ That women ought to paint ]. Fowlenes is loathesome; can it [ that ] be soe that [ which ] helpes it? What thou lovest most [omitted] in hir face is colour, and this [omitted] painting gives that; but thou hatest it, not because it is, but because thou knowest it is [omitted]. Foole, whom ignorance only [omitted] maketh [ makes ] happie. (fol. 101) 39 As Helen Peter's extensive collation indicates, few of these variants are unique to Manningham's Diary; instead, most appear in one or more manuscripts . The close connections among various manuscripts provide corroborating evidence that, without relying on his memory, for no tell-tale signs point to this means of transmission, Manningham's direct copying produces a faithful transcript from a manuscript carrying some contemporary authority because it circulated among mutual friends after being transmitted, however indirectly, from an authorial source (even if some of the manuscript's readings were later judged inferior by printers and editors). This conclusion is reinforced on the same pages that contain Paradoxes 2 and 10 by the appearance of two other Paradoxes that were not included in the Juvenilia —"Hee that weepeth is most wise" and "To keepe sheepe the best lyfe"—but that have received serious consideration as authentic compositions by Donne. 40 Although the uncertain nature of the transmission of these manuscripts means that my conclusions are necessarily tentative, a comparison of the Diary with three manuscript sources that Manningham consults—Davies's Lottery, Wenman's Legend of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Donne's Paradoxes —suggests that he had access to texts that carried some authority and made extensive, generally reliable transcripts by copying directly from them. Manningham's transcript of another manuscript text by Donne attempts to reproduce its iambic pentameter couplet form. The results, which stand in sharp contrast to the transcript of William Warner's couplet beginning "A Womans love is river-like," do not follow the source with care or present a condensed version that might be termed a précis. Rather, this entry reveals numerous misrememberings and clumsy approximations that point to the use of memory after a lapse of some time. After reading the manuscript of one of Donne's Epigrams, Manningham writes the following title, attribution, and couplet: Of a beggar that lay on the ground (Dun) He can not goe nor sitt nor stand, the beggar cryes; Then though he speake the truthe yet still he lyes. (fol. 118) Besides beginning with an alexandrine, Manningham's version presents other clear differences from anything contained in this epigram's manuscript tradition , whose extant documents include only one substantive variation—the title (other early manuscripts have no title or refer to the poem by such titles as "A beggar," "On a Beggar," or "On a Cripple")—from the 1633 printed text: A Lame Begger I AM unable, yonder begger cries, To stand, or move; if he say true, hee lies. 41 Referring to Manningham's entry as "obviously from memory," W. Milgate, the editor of Donne's Satires, Epigrams and Verse Letters, observes that "Those who find epigrams memorable often have faulty memories, and many variations in the manuscripts can be ascribed to this cause." 42 That Manningham's entry begins with a title that weakly attempts to summarize the couplet while merely restating it and identifying a setting ("on the ground") suggests that his memory is at work, providing an approximation to fulfill the expectation that a title should precede the couplet. Further evidence of memorial intervention appears in the misremembering of some key verbs, as "stand" and "move" are transformed into "sitt" and "stand," and switched to the couplet's opening line. This conclusion about the role of Manningham's memory may be strengthened by the fact that the Diary 's version is entirely in the third person, so it lacks the dramatic first-person opening and subsequent shift to the third person that appear in the printed text and all other manuscript versions. Yet Manningham's reproducing of the couplet's rhyme and word-play indicates that this manuscript is connected in some way to an authoritative line of transmission. However, the substantive differences between the epigram contained in the Diary and the one contained in all extant manuscripts 43 demonstrate that Manningham, rather than writing a summary or transcribing the complete couplet directly from a manuscript (even an inferior one), uses his memory to attempt to reproduce the poem's form and to convey a loose sense of its contents, focusing on the final word's pun. (c) Oral Sources In early modern England, as in our own age, people often display different levels of skill when taking notes from material that they read and material that they hear, but when Manningham transcribes from oral sermon sources the results are analogous to the Diary 's entries based on his direct copying of printed texts and manuscripts. At Paul's Cross in 1602, he takes extensive notes on two sermons that were printed some years later: Robert Wakeman's on Jonah 3:4-5 (20 June 1602) was published as Ionahs Sermon, and Ninivehs Repentance in 1606 (fols. 27b-28), and John Spenser's on Isaiah 5:4 (10 October 1602) appeared as A Learned and Graciovs Sermon Preached at Paules Crosse in 1615 (fols. 40-43). The Diary contains excerpts from only the first half of Wakeman's printed sermon, just as it includes nothing from the final section of Spenser's. Although this gap is difficult to explain—did Manningham leave the church before the sermons ended, find the second half of each sermon less than noteworthy, or suffer homiletic fatigue (Wakeman's sermon extends to some 102 printed pages, Spenser's to 50)?—the entries he wrote lack any sign of relying on memory over a significant amount of time: Wakeman: As Noahs doue came from the waters of the floud, with an oliue braunch in her mouth, Gen. 8.11. Even so this heavenly doue (for so the name of Ionah in the Hebrew importeth, &amp; St. Ierome on the 1 of this prophecy &amp; else-where so interpreteth it) cōmeth vnto these Ninivits, from the waters of the sea, wherin a little before hee had beene almost drowned with an oliue branch in his mouth, preaching mercy and peace vnto them if they would repent, and turne from their wicked wayes. 44 Manningham: As Noahs dove came from the floud with an olive braunch in the mouth, soe this heavenly Dove (for soe Jonah signifieth) came from the waters of the sea with a sermon of mercy in his cry, "Yett fourty dayes." (fol. 27b) Because Manningham records sentences that do not appear when Spenser's sermon is printed posthumously more than a decade after it was delivered, it is clear that someone—probably the preacher, given the substantive nature of the changes—revised the sermon during that interval. 45 When writing a summary of Spenser's sermon, Manningham reveals "a keen grasp" of the sermon's "fundamental points," 46 in the view of his modern editor, as he sometimes reproduces the preacher's wording and sometimes alters it: Spenser: Which ministreth an answere to their [Catholics'] vaine objections; who demand of vs where our Church was for so many ages, till Martin Luthers dayes, in what caue of the earth it lurked? for our Church is one and the same which it was at the first planting of Christianity amongst vs; It hath alwayes had one and the same roote and foundation, one and the same Christ publikely professed, though at the first more purely, afterwards more corruptly; and now by Gods mercy the same Christ more purely againe. For as the new dressing and weeding of a Vineyard, is not a new planting. . . . 47 Manningham: Yf anie aske, as manie Papistes use to doe, where our church was before Martin Luther was borne, we aunswer that it is the same churche that was from the beginninge, and noe newe on[e] as they terme it, for the weeding of a vyneyard is noe destroyinge, nor the pruning any newe planting. . . . (fol. 40) Grasping Spenser's main response to objections to the reformed faith and conveying it in his horticultural terms, Manningham reveals what Sorlien calls "an ear for the preacher's imagery" as he presents this "remarkably accurate paraphrase and précis." 48 Although the notes on both Wakeman's and Spenser's sermons are selective and compressed, they provide closer paraphrases than one would expect to find if Manningham used his memory after some time passed. To cite a representative example of radical compression of an oral source until little more than its essence remains, when Manningham writes about a sermon in March 1603 he does not identify the date, the preacher, or the text he chose to preach on, but he does provide the location—"AT A SPITTLE SERMON"—and a concise summary of the main point, while capturing its play on words: "Yf our synnes come out with a newe addicion, Godes punishmentes will come out with a newe edition" (fol. 109). Similarly, he presents a reliable one-sentence summary of a sermon on 31 October 1602: "At Paules Dr. Dove made a sermon against the excessive pride and vanitie of women in apparraile, &amp;c., which vice he said was in their husbandes power to correct" (fol. 54b). 49 The nature of Manningham's single sentences from these sermons—short excerpts that summarize key observations while reproducing only a little of the sources' exact wording—points to his purposeful recording of a pun and rhyme as rhetorical flourishes or of a concise moral lesson, all written down while the preachers spoke. With its focus on John Manningham's techniques and reliability as a note-taker, this examination of his various entries from printed texts, manuscripts , and oral sermon sources allows us to be somewhat more confident when considering the nature and significance of the Diary 's entry on Lancelot Andrewes's 1602 Whit-Sunday sermon. Drawn to another preacher of some stature, just as he was drawn to John Spenser and John King, and willing to devote many pages of his Diary to Andrewes's sermon, Manningham took notes directly—that is, while the preacher spoke. As in all other entries in the Diary, there are no signs of his recopying shorthand notes, and as in all other entries except the one on John Donne's epigram "Of a beggar that lay on the ground," there are no signs of his relying on medium- or longterm memory. Manningham captures Andrewes's characteristic rhetorical flourishes, such as his alliteration ("The Holy Ghost is not given to all in the same measure, nor the same manner" [fol. 24]), and especially his imagery , balanced syntax, and repetition ("Wee knowe that bread is the strength of mans hart, yet sometymes it may be expedient to fast: our bloud is the treasury of our lyfe, yet sometymes it is expedient to loose it; our eyesight is deare and precious unto us, yet sometymes it is expedient to sitt in a darke roome" [fol. 23]). The evidence I have gathered from oral sermon sources as well as printed and manuscript texts further indicates that Manningham's notes on Andrewes's sermon do not constitute a word-for-word or complete record. Rather, while Manningham captures some of his sources' exact wording , as in his notes on Samuel Rowlands's Tis Merrie When Gossips Meete and Thomas Stapleton's Orationes Academicæ, he also freely shifts his notetaking technique and writes paraphrases and summaries, as in many of his entries on printed prose tracts, such as those by William Watson, John Hayward , and Thomas Floyd, and on many manuscripts, though his notes on Andrewes's sermon do not appear to contain any instances of radical compression . We are fortunate not only that Manningham and his little book were present when Andrewes preached on Whit-Sunday in 1602, but also that Andrewes consulted his own sermons and lectures so often. A number of printed and manuscript texts that have been identified as possibly being by him might find their attributions strengthened because his echoes and repetitions make apparent the connections with canonical texts, as is the case with the Orphan Lectures and various manuscripts. Just as only one source— John Manningham's Diary —contains evidence about two of Donne's Paradoxes that are not extant, so only the Diary provides the necessary information to connect the 1602 sermon to a later Whit-Sunday sermon by Andrewes. In each instance, the diarist's intervention is a fluke of history. The evidence is overwhelming that Manningham, precisely as he did when taking notes as Wakeman and Spenser preached, leaves a fairly full, reasonably reliable, and in this instance unique account of the event.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Robert Parker Sorlien, ed., The Diary of John Manningham of the Middle Temple, 1602-1603 (Hanover, NH: Published for the University of Rhode Island by The University Press of New England, 1976), 10. In this essay, all references to Manningham's Diary are from Sorlien's edition and will be given parenthetically in the text. 2 Most of Andrewes's extant sermons were published as XCVI Sermons (1629); many of his lectures were published in such volumes as A Patterne of Catechisticall Doctrine (1630), The Morall Law Expounded (1642), and ΑΠΟΣΠΑΣΜΑΤΙΑ SACRA; Or, A Collection of Posthumous and Orphan Lectures: Delivered at St. Pauls and St. Giles His Church (1657). 3 Paul Welsby, Lancelot Andrewes: 1555-1626 (London: S.P.C.K., 1958), 77-78. 4 See Chamberlain's letter to Sir Dudley Carleton of 18 April 1621, in which he casually remarks that the recent Easter sermon "is excellently commended (beeing upon the remainder of his text the last yeare)" ( The Letters of John Chamberlain, ed. Norman Egbert McClure [Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1939], 2:362). 5 In his edition of Lancelot Andrewes: Sermons (Oxford Clarendon Press, 1967), G. M. Story comments on Andrewes's referring "to his earlier treatment of a subject" and locates in the 1622 Christmas sermon "a revision and expansion of a paragraph" from the previous year's Christmas sermon, "which he must have had before him" (xlvi). See also Story, "The Text of Lancelot Andrewes's Sermons," in Editing Seventeenth Century Prose, ed. D. I. B. Smith (Toronto: Hakkert, 1972), 13-15. Nicholas Lossky, in Lancelot Andrewes, the Preacher ( 1555-1626 ): The Origins of the Mystic Theology of the Church of England, trans. Andrew Louth (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991), observes that Andrewes's Good Friday sermons contain "a very large number of repetitions—sometimes word for word—from one sermon to another" (161 n. 39). Since Lossky has not consulted the various manuscripts and posthumous texts attributed to Andrewes, and since he appears to overlook the kind of evidence that Story presents, my findings in the canonical and attributed works qualify his claim that the practice of self-echoing is "otherwise very infrequent in Andrewes" (161 n. 39). 6 In lectures delivered at St. Paul's on 16 October and 19 October 1591, for example, Andrewes clearly echoes his discussion of Adam's need for a meet help ( Orphan Lectures 210 and 215), the original tongue in Eden (209 and 213), and Adam's naming of the animals (209-220 and 215). 7 Andrewes discusses the church and sheep-fold in a sermon on 21 February 1591 (misdated 24 February; XCVI Sermons, 280) and a lecture probably delivered in 1598-1600 ( Orphan Lectures, 644-645); the journey of the Magi in sermons on 25 December 1620 ( XCVI Sermons, 137) and 25 December 1622 ( XCVI Sermons, 143-144); Lamentations 1:12 in a lecture probably delivered in 1598-1600 ( Orphan Lectures, 639-640) and a sermon on 6 April 1604 ( XCVI Sermons, 349-350); and the Four Daughters of God in undated Sermon 2 in Cambridge University's Emmanuel College Library MS 3.1.13 (an attribution), undated Lecture 14 and Sermon 5 in Lambeth Palace Library MS 3707 (an attribution), and a sermon on 25 December 1616 ( XCVI Sermons, 96-106). In Index of English Literary Manuscripts (London: Mansell; New York: R. R. Bowker, 1980), 1: part 1:6 (entries AndL 5-6), Peter Beal, who follows David Baxter's assessment of these documents and accepts them as being by Andrewes, also follows Baxter's chronology and assigns the conjectural dates of 1597-1601 to the lecture and sermon in the Lambeth Palace Library MS, which was previously housed in the Cambridge University Library as MS Add. 7976. 8 Andrewes, XCVI Sermons, sig. A2 r . 9 John Sparrow, "John Donne and Contemporary Preachers: Their Preparation of Sermons for Delivery and for Publication," Essays and Studies 16 (1930), 144-178 (p. 151). W. Fraser Mitchell's comment is also relevant: "Anglicans wrote their sermons before delivery" ( English Pulpit Oratory from Andrewes to Tillotson: A Study of Its Literary Aspects [1932; reprint, New York: Russell and Russell, 1962], 26). 10 The dates were 9 June 1622, 5 August 1623, 10 February 1624, and 28 March 1624. 11 See Story, "The Text of Lancelot Andrewes's Sermons," 13, and Lancelot Andrewes: Sermons, xlv-xlvi. I discuss the relationship between Andrewes's written and spoken words in" `Betwixt the Hammer and the Anvill': Lancelot Andrewes's Revision Techniques in the Manuscript of His 1620 Easter Sermon," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 89 (1995): 149-182. 12 Andrewes, XCVI Sermons, 628. All quotations from the 1611 sermon are from the 1629 edition of XCVI Sermons and will be given parenthetically in the text. 13 All dates are new style. I have examined the manuscript, which measures 4″ x 6″ and contains 133 leaves; brief descriptions of it appear in Sorlien, 2, and John Bruce, ed., Diary of John Manningham (London: Camden Society, 1868), i. For more on the Diary 's organization , see n. 17 below. 14 For Manningham's descriptions of preachers, see Diary, fols. 79 and 80; for his brief analyses of sermons, see fols. 54b, 68b, and 99b. 15 Sorlien, 13. Mitchell misrepresents the Diary by stating that it contains the sermons' "main doctrines often fairly fully noted down" and that "a large portion" is devoted to "analyses of the various sermons" ( English Pulpit Oratory, 35-36). 16 Mitchell, English Pulpit Oratory, 36. 17 Sorlien, 13. Sorlien's explanation also accounts for the Diary 's breaks in chronology (see fols. 103b-104 and 106-106b)—more satisfactorily, I think, than his theory that "the writer seems at times to have entered his notes and impressions wherever he had vacant space" (2), a hypothesis advanced earlier by Bruce, x. 18 The breaks in the Diary 's chronological presentation of entries could point to recopying longhand notes, but the lack of the usual signs of recopying—such as repetition and eye-skip, which carries a word or phrase over from one line in the text to another—suggests that this did not occur. 19 Sorlien, 13. 20 See Mitchell, 15, for a discussion of the various ways in which an early modern sermon was transmitted, including how a preacher might write, deliver, revise, and disseminate his text and how auditors and printers contributed to the process. Sparrow's essay on "John Donne and Contemporary Preachers" also provides useful information about this process. 21 Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, no manuscript that Manningham transcribed from is extant and available for comparison, except perhaps for Thomas Wenman's The Legend of Mary, Queen of Scots (discussed below), which I cannot locate. 22 Four of the printed texts discussed below—by Floyd, Hayward, Rowlands, and Watson—appear in only one edition that antedates the Diary. Manningham quotes and paraphrases from Books 11 and 12 of Warner's Albions England, so he must have consulted the enlarged edition of 1596, a variant of the text dated 1597, or the 1602 edition, which is the one I have consulted. I have not been able to trace the complete publishing history of Stapleton's Orationes Academicæ, Miscellaneæ Triginta Qvatvor or locate the other two books from which Manningham apparently took notes directly: Jacques Cappel, De Etymologiis Juris Civilis (fol. 75) and Joannes Ludovicus Vives, Ad Sapientiam Introductio (fols. 103, 113, and 118b). 23 Sorlien's notes provide selective comparisons between Manningham's Diary and his sources. To prepare for writing this essay, I did more thorough collations, including all substantives ; these are consistent with Sorlien's in indicating when Manningham quotes, paraphrases , or writes a précis. 24 See the corresponding material in Rowlands's Tis Merrie When Gossips Meete, sig. B2 r , and Sorlien's selective but useful collation (345-346). 25 See the corresponding material in Stapleton's Orationes Academicæ, Miscellaneæ Triginta Qvatvor, 1:97, and Sorlien's selective but useful collation (359-360). 26 Watson, A Decacordon of Ten Qvodlibeticall Qvestions, 151-152. 27 Hayward, An Answer to the First Part of a Certaine Conference Concerning Svccession , 34.

Manningham's transcript of Paradox 2 may be related to the Westmoreland Manuscript and his transcript of Paradox 10 may be related to the Stephens Manuscript; the latter Paradox is numbered 7 in Peters's edition. The Diary provides the first dated reference to the Paradoxes (R. E. Bennett, "John Manningham and Donne's Paradoxes," MLN 46 [1931]: 312-313; Sorlien, 382). As I discuss below, it also contains some possible additions to Donne's canon (see Bennett , 309-313; Sorlien, 382). 39 Variants are cited from John Donne, Juvenilia, sig. B2 r-v . 40 Bennett believes that there is "very good evidence" (310) that Donne wrote "Hee that weepeth is most wise" and that "we can safely attribute" it to him (312). Of "To keepe sheepe the best lyfe," he writes: "it is possible, if not probable, that he [Manningham] had before him a paradox by Donne which was somewhat different from those which have been preserved" (312). 41 W.

      <field name="heading_text">A FUNERALL ELEGYE . . . NOT . . . BY W.S. AFTER ALL by Jill Farringdon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1989, Donald W. Foster published his book Elegy by W.S.: A Study in Attribution, 1 an examination of the authorship of A Funerall Elegye In Memory of the Late Virtuous Master William Peter of Whipton near Exeter; by W.S., printed for Thomas Thorpe, 1612. A work of investigative literary scholarship, it received widespread interest for both its scope and methodology . Some who read it were persuaded that the initials "W.S." could well have belonged to William Shakespeare; in fact, so persuaded that the poem has been included in more than one edition of Shakespeare's collected works. 2 No doubt confidence in Foster's scholarship was enhanced when he was able to identify correctly the anonymous author of Primary Colors (Joe Klein), and went on to be engaged in legal cases as a forensic expert, including that of the Unabomber. Such popular fame made him a widely known and admired "expert" in attribution. However, not everyone was persuaded. Debate over the Elegye 's authorship continued in literary circles, though "debate" is a polite word for what has been described as a "battle" which raged in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement. 3 Academics took sides. Vituperation and venom and sarcasm flew right and left ("Has he read it?"). Foster's own riposte to his most powerful critic, the Shakespearean scholar and editor Brian Vickers, asserted "an inattention to facts that would not be tolerated in an undergraduate ". 4 At the same time, one of Foster's supporters wrote that "Vickers should probably try to keep his foot out of his mouth". 5 Now it seems that the "battle" is over. In the light of new work suggesting that the Elegye 's author was John Ford, Shakespeare's near-contemporary, Foster has conceded that he was mistaken: he, too, now believes Ford to be the likely author, 6 and joins what seems likely to become a literary consensus . Is there any more to be said? Well, yes. This is a classic case where recourse to an objective method could have made a major contribution to such an acrimonious debate. It is somewhat unseemly (if fun for some readers) for professional academics to hurl brickbats at each other in public, particularly when arguments over attributing an obscure seventeenth-century poem can seem to some modern readers like the mediaeval debates over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. The purpose of this article, therefore, is not merely to confirm the consensus that now appears to be emerging (although it is worth noting, en passant, that authorship questions are rarely finally settled by consensus: Freud went to his grave believing that the plays of Shakespeare were written by the Earl of Oxford). Its purpose is to suggest that where literary debate exists, a non-literary technique of language analysis has the virtue of avoiding the pitfalls of serious error which, in this case, led to publishing mistakes that must be an embarrassment to the editors of the Shakespeare editions now including a poem likely to be by John Ford. Furthermore, a comment expressed since Foster's recantation pinpoints the difficulty for the non-specialist who must rely on the opinion of " experts " in these terms: such attributions can come to seem only pointless exercises (or "games") by which anyone can "show" anything which may be later disproved by another game-player. Thus, the new consensus may seem mired at the personal level: "And how joyfully the anti-Don-Fosterites dance around it". 7 This sense of disillusion underscores the urgent need for independent witness. For it really does not matter how strong or weak a case critics and scholars may make in terms of cogent literary analysis: these will be irrelevant where an objective procedure exists which does not depend on literary judgments, however well-argued and compelling those may be to fellow-academics. What has always been needed is an independent method, one which is capable of delivering a statistical probability in matters of attributing human utterance in general and which can then be applied to particular cases like this one. This would by-pass any need for the development of a statistical "Shaxicon" (Foster), or reliance on rhetorical figures of speech like, say, anadiplosis or polyptoton (Vickers). This article proposes that use of the scientific technique of authorship attribution called "cusum analysis" made it possible, as long ago as 1997, to show that the poem is certainly by one writer (i.e. it is homogeneous), but that it is distinguishable from the writing of William Shakespeare. Further, it can be shown that the short Dedication 8 to the Funerall Elegye is also homogeneous , but can be distinguished from samples of the writing of Shakespeare, including his own two Dedications to his poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, usefully signed "William Shakespeare". 9 There is, however , a new and surprising finding: the Dedication signed "W.S." can be distinguished from samples of the Elegye which it prefaces, indicating that the author of the one is unlikely to be the author of the other. In other words, this analysis proposes that the ascription "by W.S." on the title page and the Dedication signed "W.S." were never reliable indicators of authorship either of poem or of Dedication. In his book, Don Foster began by asking that same crucial question: "the first thing we must ask is whether the initials are not simply wrong. " 10 He went on "The answer is almost certainly no". The answer of cusum analysis was and remains: almost certainly, yes. Before proceeding to outline the results of analysis, it will be necessary to elucidate this technique, which is not as well known as it should be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Question of Authorship Donald Foster's book is packed with detail of the sort that literary scholars and attribution studies have traditionally used to investigate authorship of anonymous literary texts: namely, external evidence, where it exists, and internal evidence involving tables of massive statistical data, vocabulary counts, the construction by Foster of his special "Shaxicon" based on Spevack's concordances to Shakespeare's plays, and verbal parallels of specific lines and allusions from the plays. With all these approaches to attribution, the literary mind is familiar. Sifting through and understanding such extensive detail requires focussed concentration, and is a task capable of being undertaken mainly by professionals who are in a position to weigh the evidence. Even then, the use of numerical methods, especially when a computer is used, remains for many scholars a suspect intrusion into the traditional literary world: witness the remark by poet Peter Levi that "such [computerassisted] analysis is almost always complete rubbish", an attitude described by Stanley Wells in a review of Foster's book as "an extreme point of view". 11 Nevertheless, it is one which is also widespread: one of Vickers's objections to Foster's conclusions in his book was his "too great reliance on computerized statistics" (my italics), a method he found served "an atomistic notion of style". 12 A Foster supporter, though, saw Foster's study as a statistically unimpeachable example of "Shakespeare's late style". 13 The point to note here is that each critic, whether for or against, assumed that Foster's investigation made claims about literary style. This point will be crucially important as elucidation of cusum analysis proceeds. However, the first observation to make when coming to negative conclusions regarding Shakespeare as possible author of the Funerall Elegye, by the use of a quantitative method very different from Foster's, is to note the satisfaction which may arise in the hearts of all those hostile to the use of computers in literary studies. O joy! The "computing experts" cannot agree!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Cusum Technique 14 This would be a short-lived joy since cusum analysis could actually be carried out—if more slowly—using an abacus, or pencil and paper, instead of a computer. Nevertheless, as one who is literary-critical by both training and inclination, the present writer has a large measure of sympathy with the dilemma of literary sceptics towards numerical studies, although that sympathy may be qualified by the observation that the computer is only a mechanical aid, and that there can be no objection to counting as such. 15 Consider discussion of the "number" of questions in Macbeth or the " preponderance " of disease imagery in Hamlet. Cusum analysis has been used since 1990, both for studies in literary attribution and also in a forensic setting. It is the invention of A. Q. Morton, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a retired Minister in the Church of Scotland, whose life-time research has been devoted to developing an objective, scientific method of authorship attribution, one capable of being independently verified. 16 The virtue of the method is that it is an attributive measure applicable to utterance of all kinds irrespective of date of composition or genre, whether in speech or writing, and has been widely tested. Attribution studies have been made on a short story newly found and attributed (initially) to D. H. Lawrence; to new essays by Henry Fielding; to the disputed Famine Diary, by Gerald Keegan purported to have been written on board a Famine Ship in 1845; and most recently to a newly-found poem "The Barberry Tree", the conclusion of joint-authorship by Coleridge and Wordsworth being precisely identical to that arrived at by literary scholarship. It has been used on the utterance of children, including a study of Helen Keller from her first year of language-use at the age of eight. 17 including the highest courts—the Appeal Courts in London and Dublin, the Central Criminal Court, Dublin, and the Old Bailey. 18 So how does it work? Basic to the method is that a sophisticated analysis of language for attribution purposes must be based on regular and recurrent usage which is very frequent while also being unconscious to the user. What has always been needed is a method simple in principle and reliable in results, and, in cusum analysis, such a method has become available. The identification of authorship has been found to lie mainly in the small function words, usually of two, three or four letters, with which sentences are structured. Obviously, spelling is conventional and has differed over time, but the syntactic features analysed remain remarkably stable. In trying to understand why cusum analysis "works" with function words, it is reasonable to think about an individual's total vocabulary. As any child's reading scheme will confirm, this may be divided into sections for frequency of usage. Twenty-five per cent of the time, language use in English consists of the repetition of very few words. One common scheme gives a mere twelve words ( a, and, he, I, in, is, it, of, that, the, to, was, ) followed by another 20 words for up to 35 per cent of normal utterance. It may be asked how reliable such lists of "most frequent" words may be. Concordances of authors usually show that these twelve words appear at, or near the top, of the most-frequent-words lists. A comparison of the lists for Henry Fielding's novel Joseph Andrews (written in 1741) and for Dylan Thomas's Collected Poems (1950) yields a remarkable similarity. These two authors were writing very different kinds of work—novel and modern poetry—separated by two hundred and fifty years of England language usage; yet both revealed high-frequency lists of near identical words ( the, and, of, in, I, a, to, you, my, is, that, he were among their top twelve; compare the twelve most-frequently used words in Shakespeare's total corpus: the, and, I, to, of, a, you, my, that, in, is, not —the overlap is obvious). This surely confirms the usefulness of using these vocabulary items for recognising authorship. Half the time we speak, we are using over and over again the same function words; two-thirds of the time we speak, we are using a total of about two hundred and fifty words, which constitute only a tiny proportion of our total vocabulary. From the remaining thousands of words, which constitute only a tiny proportion of our total vocabulary. From the remaining thousands of words, we select those we need to convey content and meaning, or semantics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reading Cusum Graphs and Charts The principle on which cusum analysis is based is thus extremely simple, being predominantly based on unconscious, habitual use of function words. The practise is within the grasp of any academic prepared to devote the necessary time and effort to learning it; but, to sound a cautionary note, this would be no rapid process with automatic results. Learning how to use the method with confidence takes about three to six months of practise on a wide variety of texts. By starting with the analysis of one's own utterance (as providing samples of known integrity, a crucial proviso), any researcher is enabled to gain confidence in the effectiveness of the method. The benefit of "tutorials" from experienced analysts is also important. Only then may one approach one's literary problem. It should be noted here that there have been various attempts at critiques of cusum analysis: these have all failed in remarkably similar ways, namely, by misunderstandings of both principle and practise. One misunderstanding is the notion that the method is based on a single invariable language habit (counting words of 2 or 3 letters is the one usually selected), which is suitable for all writers/speakers and occurs in rigid proportions or ratios in each sentence—an obvious absurdity. There are, in fact, nine language-habit tests used on any sample under analysis to discover which one will be consistent for the writer; and these are counted in no simple proportional manner. Analysing for Authorship devotes a whole chapter to "Answering the Critics", and each critique is carefully examined there. Despite fairly widespread awareness of the few critical attempts, there is complete ignorance of the endorsement of the method's validity by the statistician responsible for writing the British Standard on cusums—who, further, developed a refinement which enhances the original method for the satisfaction of professional statisticians. 19 One impression of the method's "unreliability", apparently widespread and also described in the book, deserves special mention here since it involves an interview with Morton by a television company who had asked for two samples of writing to be analysed for homogeneity. Given Morton's opinion that they were indistinguishable, the interviewer then dramatically revealed that they were by a man convicted of corporate crime, and by the Lord Chief Justice (Taylor). In actual fact, the "crook" was reading out a company report compiled by his department so that the sample was not his own utterance at all; moreover, the TV crew had got hold of a sample of writing by the wrong Lord Taylor! 20 As always, the integrity of the text is everything. Given corrupt data, "wrong" answers will be inevitable: in computer jargon, "garbage in, garbage out". In Morton can be faulted, it is surely in accepting too readily samples whose origin he had not personally been able to verify. But to the viewing public, it apparently seemed Q.E.D. and remains so among some academics in the attribution field to this day, even if it calls for a certain naïvety to believe that scientific validity can be decided by a ten-minute TV stunt. The old "I saw it in the newspapers" seems to have been superseded by the new "I saw it on TV". Less well-remembered (or known at all) are the many blind tests where the technique has been successful, some of them required by the presiding judge in a court case. The most amazing example of these is perhaps the one where the "challenger", or person setting the test (Sir Kenneth Dover), 21 did the counting himself and passed over only the resulting numbers—not the Greek text—to Morton. Morton promptly discovered the inserted passage. Properly used, cusum analysis is a useful tool. A major advantage of the method is that the results of analysing quite small samples can be visually demonstrated in graphic charts which may be understood by the non-expert (for example, a juror in a court case). As well as resistance to computers, there can also be an in-built resistance among literary professionals to looking at graphs. Yet a graph is only a way of presenting information. The more familiar we become with pictorial ways of interpretation, the easier it becomes to "read" the information in that form. How naturally we can now read, for example, television weather maps: "See those isobars packed in tightly together", says the TV Weatherperson, and we know we are in for a spell of high winds. The sample of utterance under investigation is counted, by cumulative sum (hence, cusum ), first for sentence length and the deviation of each sentence in the sequence from the average. The second step is to count, again by cumulative sum, some feature, usually called the "habit", of language-use within the sentence. The nine tests available to the analyst are based on function words, as already described. This is not the place to explore why such features have been found to work, although speculation is intriguing. 22 We need only point to the success of the method in analysing: natural utterance, both written and spoken; edited text; translated work; children's writing; dialect; and disputed utterance. Here we have an attributive measure of great sensitivity which is objective and which works across both time of authorial composition, and genre. The last claim is one which has occasioned a degree of scepticism, and it is as well to outline the obstacles which must be overcome and habits of mind which must be set aside before the technique can gain confident acceptance by literary scholars. The cusum technique has nothing to do with style or literary value. It is purely quantitative, not qualitative (remember now those assumptions that statistics were analysing style ?). Therefore, such procedure as comes naturally to the literary critic, that is sensitivity to tone, image, rhythm; comparison of like with like in terms of genre or date of composition; the difference between poetry and prose—all these must be set aside to turn instead to a study of language by measurable units, and that unit normally the sentence. Whatever the soundness of the literary/stylistic judgments brought to bear on the Elegye by Professor Vickers or others, such judgments will remain interpretative rather than objective—indeed, a "game" to some readers. That is why it is worth drawing attention to a method which asserted five years ago that the Elegye had nothing to do with Shakespeare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Attributing Shakespeare There was no reason why Shakespeare should be an exception to the method. My own investigation, into analysing first Shakespearean samples and then samples of Christopher Marlowe, led to a submission for the Calvin Hoffman prize for attribution. 23 Shakespeare proved to be homogeneous by more than one test, two language habits within the sentences of the chosen samples being found to be highly consistent: that of using three and four letter words plus words starting with a vowel ( qs34lw+ivw ) and a second consistent habit, that of using 2, 3 and 4 letter words ( qs234lw ). Samples were chosen from Shakespeare's writing, from early and late work (using modern texts), to show consistency over time: thus, the ending of The Tempest (38 sentences) and the opening of Venus and Adonis (25 sentences) were chosen. When considering a disputed text—for example, in a legal setting—the first requirement is a sample of utterance indisputably that of the subject of the enquiry. In the case of Shakespeare, we have little personal utterance except for the short signed dedications to his two poems, Venus and Adonis (VA) and The Rape of Lucrece (RL): these may be regarded as authentic Shakespeare. The two dedications together comprise only eight sentences, yet the advantage of cusum analysis is its ability to show consistency in short samples. 24 This sample of the two dedications proved a useful discriminator. One of the sentences was in fact an anomaly: "What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours". Although cusum analysis has nothing to do with style, this departs so far from natural utterance as to be an exaggerated rhetorical flourish, a courtly bow in language—and may well be typical of Shakespeare in literary terms, which is of no relevance here. It should be stressed that in a longer sample of sentences, it would become virtually invisible; but in this short combined sample it slightly disturbed the consistent march of the graphlines , so was removed to make a clearer illustration. In analysis, cusum graphs are drawn first of the sentence length ( qsld ), and then of the habit (e.g. qs234lw ). These are produced on transparencies. It is then possible to slide the "habit"-transparency over the sentence-length transparency to see whether the two graph-lines track each other closely, or even coincide. If they do, the sample may safely be assumed to be homogeneous , the work of one writer. If the two graphs separate, the sample may be safely assumed to the "mixed" utterance, or non-homogeneous. However, for purposes of presentation, instead of using transparencies the two graphs can be produced as one, to make a cusum "chart": this shows one graph-line superimposed on the other. Figure 1 shows two graphs superimposed FIGURE 1. Shakespeare's dedications to Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece (8 sentences) combined and analysed as one. as a "chart" for the cusum analysis of Shakespeare's two Dedications (VA and RL combined). The habit shown is one of his two discriminating habits, the use of three and four letter words plus words starting with a vowel ( qs34lw+ivw ). The two lines clearly track each other here, a consistent habit running throughout, so that a single author is indicated, as we knew to be the case. FIGURE 2. Combined sample of 4 alternate sentences from Venus and Adonis and the dedications to Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece (total, 16 sentences). Having shown that Shakespeare was no exception to the method, the authentic Shakespearean utterance was analysed with samples from The Tempest and Venus and Adonis. The Dedications blended smoothly with the selected samples and revealed no separation, the two graph-lines tracking each other throughout to show a consistent habit at work, confirming homogeneity for the two combined samples (see figs. 2, 3). FIGURE 3. Eight sentences of the dedications to Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece followed by 30 sentences from The Tempest. As already reported in the opening paragraph of this article, cusum analysis of the Funeral Elegye yielded the unsurprising results that the poem and its Dedication were both homogeneous. Each was written by one writer (and the many relevant charts produced are available for inspection). Was that writer Shakespeare? Firstly, in a combined analysis of the Dedication "by W.S." and the two Dedications by Shakespeare, the two lines clearly separate, indicating two writers at work (see fig. 4). Then, this result of mixed authorship was repeated in subsequent analyses with samples from Venus and Adonis and The Tempest : the inconsistency with Shakespeare's writing was confirmed. Whenever either samples from the Elegye, or else its Dedication, were analysed in combination with samples of Shakespeare, the two-graph lines separated markedly, indicating not single but mixed authorship (see figs. 5, 6).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Analysis by samples Obviously, it is only possible to show as illustrations a few of the results obtained from the process of analysis. These are intended to show how the method works and to indicate the outcome of the tests. There may be some unease that what is being reported is based on samples of authors only. But FIGURE 4. Shakespeare's dedications to Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece followed by the Elegye dedication. FIGURE 5. Twenty-four sentences from Venus and Adonis followed by 20 sentences from the Elegye. if these consistently give the same result, whether it be that the samples are indistinguishable or distinguishable, it is fair to ask how many samples would become "satisfactory" to the doubtful? Ten—twenty—fifty? There has to be a point at which the accumulated evidence becomes overwhelmingly persuasive . Readers disinclined to trust sampling should ask themselves whether FIGURE 6. Fifteen sentences from the Elegye followed by 30 sentences from The Tempest. it is mere chance or co-incidence that the two Dedications which were signed by William Shakespeare can instantly be shown to be consistent; and then, whether it is equally co-incidental that they should happen to be indistinguishable from samples from his first poem and last play but distinguishable from samples by other writers, like Christopher Marlowe and John Ford. It would be disquieting, though, for literary scholarship if this investigation were to seem to set itself up in opposition to traditional methods. As Morton has written, "Cusum analysis is not some isolated touchstone of authenticity". 25 In fact, cusum analysis works best when able to support an attribution made by literary scholars, and this it has done many times. In addition to literary attributions already cited, Donald Foster's conclusion with regard to the authorship of "Twas the Night Before Christmas" 26 is entirely supported by my cusum investigation of that poem's authorship. Naturally, most important for a positive attribution of the Funerall Elegye is the virtual consensus that it was John Ford who wrote the poem. This provided a new putative author to work on. Cusum analysis showed first that Ford's writing was consistent by the habit of using words of 2, 3 or 4 letters ( qs234lw ). Then, samples of Ford were shown to be consistent with samples of the Elegye (fig. 7). Four dedications by Ford can be also shown to be perfectly consistent with each other and with the poem (fig. 8). In both FIGURE 7. Combined sample of 42 sentences from John Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore with 20 sentences from the Elegye inserted. FIGURE 8. Twenty sentences from the Elegye followed by John Ford's dedications to The Lover's Melancholy, Perkin Warbeck, Love's Sacrifice, and The Lady's Trial. these charts, there is a smooth tracking of the graph-lines and no separation: Ford's writing and that of the Elegye 's author are indistinguishable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Dedication to the Elegye We have seen in figure 4 that Shakespeare's two dedications and that of the Elegye separate markedly, indicating mixed authorship. What was utterly unexpected was that analysis which combined samples of the poem with its Dedication (fig. 9), and Ford's signed dedications with it (figs. 10, 11), also gave the result of mixed utterance: dedications which we know are by Ford give a consistent result, while the dedication "by W.S." is not consistent with them. Samples of the poem were consistent with each other, but not with its dedication "by W.S.". The two graph-lines for these analyses can be seen diverging widely, indicating mix of authors. 27 FIGURE 9. Ten sentences of the Elegye with its dedication inserted at sentence 6.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Key Questions Is the poem A Funerall Elegye by W.S. by one writer? Yes: analysis of lengthy samples revealed homogeneity. Can an authentic sample of Shakespeare, his two signed dedications, be shown to be consistent with other samples by him, but to separate from samples by another writer? Yes: all analyses with both Christopher Marlowe and John Ford resulted in separation, visible proof of mixed authorship. Is the Dedication to the Elegye consistent with Shakespeare's own two dedications to Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece ? No. The Dedication FIGURE 10. Combined analysis of John Ford's dedication to The Lady's Trial (6 sentences) with the Elegye dedication (5 sentences) following. FIGURE 11. Four dedications by John Ford (to The Lover's Melancholy, Perkin War- beck, Love's Sacrifice, and The Lady's Trial ) followed by the Elegye dedication. to the Elegye was clearly distinguishable from Shakespeare's signed dedications. Is the Dedication to A Funerall Elegye written by the same person who wrote the poem? Cusum analysis has shown that it was distinguishable from the author. Are samples of John Ford consistent with samples of the Elegye ? Yes: they were found to be indistinguishable. The conclusion, therefore, is that cusum analysis has shown Shakespeare to be extremely unlikely as author of A Funerall Elegye and supports the consensus that John Ford is the likely author (though not of its Dedication).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In Thomas Cooke's short-lived periodical The Comedian, or Philosophical Enquirer, No. 5 (August 1732) there appeared together (pp. 32-38) a political essay defending the Walpole administration against the attacks of Opposition writers and a verse epistle praising the painter John Ellys. Introducing the essay, entitled "Observations on Government, the Liberty of the Press, News-papers, Partys, and Party-writer[s]," Cooke informed his readers that it had been "communicated to me by a Friend." Immediately following the essay, he introduced the poem, entitled "An Epistle to Mr. Ellys the Painter," stating that it was written by the author of the essay: As I promised, in my first Number of this Work, never to conclude my Labours of the Month, without a Piece of Poetry, I am glad that I have now the Power to oblige my Readers with one worthy their Attention, written by the Author of the preceding Observations on Government, &amp;c. In 1968, in an essay on the circle of wits and artists who joined with Hogarth in a campaign to promote the cause of native English painting, J. B. Shipley was first to suspect that Fielding, a close friend of Cooke and Ellys, was author of the poem. 1 If Fielding wrote the poem, it would of course follow that he also wrote the essay, and vice versa. Some time later, Thomas Lockwood and I independently came to this conclusion, 2 and others, notably Bertrand Goldgar, Robert Hume and Ronald Paulson, 3 have found the attributions persuasive. To date, however, the case for Fielding's authorship has not been made; and my purpose here is to adduce evidence—from his relationships and circumstances at the time of composition and from parallels with his known writings—that points convincingly to his authorship. To begin with, the notion, once prevalent among scholars, that Fielding never wavered in his hostility to the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, has been thoroughly discredited. 4 In 1729, as Fielding began his career as playwright, his unfinished burlesque of Pope's Dunciad, discovered in 1968 among the papers of his cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, 5 reflects her own political views by ardently praising Walpole while satirizing the entire phalanx of Opposition writers. Although he occasionally indulged in anonymous literary high jinks at the minister's expense in 1728 and 1730, 6 in the latter year and again in 1731 he also addressed a pair of humorous verse epistles to the Great Man, angling for his patronage. Even in The GrubStreet Opera —the first of his openly political satires, which was suppressed before it could be staged in June 1731—the ridicule is even-handed in roasting both parties: Walpole in the character of Robin the butler, and Pulteney, leader of the Opposition, in the character of William the coachman. Far from marking the beginning of Fielding's alliance with the Opposition, as is sometimes said, the suppression of the Grub-Street Opera in fact marked the beginning of a period of more than two years in which, having moved from the Little Haymarket, a much inferior theater, to the Court's own theater at Drury Lane, he prospered as London's most prolific and successful playwright. Curiously, it was Fielding himself who stopped the production of The Grub-Street Opera at the eleventh hour (so the actors reported), and Fielding, too, who actively discouraged its publication when he might have expected the book of the play to be as profitable for him as Gay's had been in the case of Polly, similarly suppressed by the government two years earlier. It is difficult to account for this self-inflicted financial damage, or for his emerging in triumph at Drury Lane after the fiasco at the Haymarket while the actors themselves were hounded into hiding by the government. The only plausible explanation for these surprising events would seem to be that Fielding's overtures to the prime minister had been at last rewarded—that by whatever means, but most likely by promising him a place at the Theatre Royal, Walpole had made it worth Fielding's while to sink his own impudent ballad opera. So it certainly appeared to the public, and to the antiministerial authors of The Grub-Street Journal, when in February 1732, soon after Fielding's comedy The Modern Husband was staged at Drury Lane, the play was published with a fulsome dedication declaring his gratitude and allegiance to "the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter." 7 Most of Fielding's friends in 1732 were associated with Walpole. Cooke in The Comedian and James Ralph in the Weekly Register both promoted the minister and his policies. And "Jack" Ellys had been engaged by Walpole to acquire the famous collection of paintings at Houghton, for which service Walpole would later appoint him Keeper of the Lions at the Tower. And when, provoked by the Dedication of The Modern Husband to Walpole, the authors of the Grub-Street Journal began a campaign of vilification against Fielding and his plays that continued throughout the spring and summer, his only defenders were Court journalists: Cooke in The Comedian (June, September, and October 1732), Ralph in the Weekly Register (8 July 1732), and a pseudonymous writer in the Daily Courant (29 July 1732). In short, there is nothing improbable about the possibility that Fielding could be the "Friend" who contributed the pieces in question to Cooke's Comedian. The evidence of the texts themselves strongly suggests that he was. This evidence consists of parallels with his known writings, interests, and relationships which are recorded in the endnotes. In selecting the parallels , I have, as earlier in attributing the Craftsman essays to Fielding, followed the advice of the late James Earle Deese, a scientist well known for his studies of the psychological bases of language: on the principle that the probability of Fielding's authorship of a given anonymous essay increases in proportion to the number of close correspondences (whether commonplaces or otherwise) between that essay and his known writings, I have kept the number of parallels high. To assist the reader in distinguishing between the commonplace and the unusual, however, I have marked with an asterisk those notes that contain striking or distinctive parallels. 8 N.B. Not only in the texts in question but throughout the journal, Cooke, or the printer of The Comedian, shows certain peculiarities of spelling which are not Fielding's: among these are the plural of nouns and the past tense of verbs ending in y, such as Partys, Enemys, Beautys, etc. and sayed, denyed, heared, etc. With the exception of the plays and certain other pieces listed below, references to Fielding's works are to the Wesleyan Edition (Middletown, CT, and Oxford: Wesleyan University Press and Oxford University Press, 1966/ 67- ), as follows in alphabetical order: Amelia, ed.

      <field name="fulltext">I. Observations on Government, the Liberty of the Press, News-papers, Partys, and Party-writer [ s ] The writer's arguments in defending Walpole and his government against the attacks of antiministerial journalists anticipate HF's defense of the Pelham administration in the late 1740s, when he complained against the abuse of the Liberty of the Press by hired "Incendiaries" and ridiculed "the Multitude ," who were swayed by such demagoguery, for presuming to think they were competent to discern "the secret Springs by which the Wheels of State move"—competent, that is, to judge the policies of the present government. Opening with an epigraph from Cicero's Tusculan Disputations that also serves as the conclusion to the essay in The Comedian, Fielding in The True Patriot (4-11 March 1746) would repeat the essayist's argument, though the essayist's "inferior Tradesman," a haberdasher in his coffee-house, has given place to "the lowest Mechanic," a cobbler in his two-penny club. Having in the previous week's leader cited the prerequisites of taste and knowledge in a critic who would judge the productions of musician, painter or writer, HF considers the case of "the Politician, whose Talents are often misrepresented, and his honest Endeavours defeated, by total Want of Skill, and Weakness of Judgment, in those who take to themselves a Right of giving a definitive Sentence in Politics." He continues: The Mischief arising from Incapacity in the Judge, in this last Instance, is on many Accounts the greatest, and particularly in this, as it is the most extensive: For all the Sciences [HF had mentioned earlier], though there are many who assume the Office of deciding, without any adequate Qualification, yet there are some who have the Modesty to confess their Ignorance; whereas, in Politics, every Man is an Adept; and the lowest Mechanic delivers his Opinion, at his Club, upon the deepest Public Measures, with as much Dignity and Sufficiency as the highest Member of the Commonwealth. Now it is scarce probable that a Cobler, or indeed any other Man of Trade, nay not even the Country Squire himself, if he be a Sportsman, should find Time sufficient , from the Business of their several Callings, however well they may be qualified , to search much into the History and Policy of the several States of Europe; and thence to form an adequate and perfect Judgment of the true Interest of their own Country, as it stands connected with, or opposed to that of others. Hence therefore it may frequently happen, that the wisest and best Measures of a Ministry may not meet with the Approbation of a Two-penny Club, or a Meeting of Fox-hunters. (pp. 235-236) The same argument asserting the incompetence of "the Multitude" to judge the appropriateness or efficacy of the government's policies is reintroduced in The Jacobite's Journal (8 October 1748): To speak plainly [Fielding writes], I am a little inclined to doubt whether Politics (tho' it seems at present to be thought the universal Science, and within the Reach of every Capacity) be, indeed, the proper Study of the Multitude; since Experience, I am afraid, if not Reason, must convince us, that they are herein liable to commit rather grosser Errors than their Superiors. (p. 405) The following Observations on Government, the Liberty of the Press, Newspapers , Partys, and Party-writer [ s ], were communicated to me by a Friend. As Nature hath 1 stamped on every Face 2 Something particular, whereby it may be distinguished from those of all other Men, 3 so hath she given to every Nation certain Characteristics different from one another. 4 There is scarce a People on Earth who have not a particular Bent, 5 which is as general among themselves as it is peculiar from that of the Rest of Mankind. Thus the general Cast 6 of the Dutch is to Trade, that of the Germans to drinking , the French to dancing, the Italians to Music, 7 and, I believe, 8 the English may of all Nations be sayed to be most inclined to Politics; and the unbounded Liberty which we enjoy of speaking and writing our Thoughts is the Cause of the present flourishing State of Politics in this Kingdom. I have often wondered within myself what Idea a Foreigner must conceive 9 at his first Entrance into 10 one of our celebrated Coffee-houses; every one of which resembles a Pamphlet-shop, or Register-office, especially on a Saturday, when, I believe, there are almost as many new Essays published in Journals in this City 11 as are new Sermons preached in it the next Day. The Spectator 12 was a great Enemy to 13 these little Cabals, and inferiour Councils of State, and endeavoured to represent them as highly prejudicial to the retail Trade of the Kingdom: the Sale of three Hats have been sometimes lost by the reading one News-paper; and many Haberdashers have undone their Familys by their too great Zeal 14 for the Good of the Nation. I must own that 15 I cannot see the great Advantage which an inferior Tradesman can reap 16 from the Study of News-papers, unless it is from the Advertisements ; which seem the Parts designed for his Perusal; and as they chiefly turn on buying and selling, I shall easyly allow him the reading them: but of what Benefit those laborious political Essays 17 which appear in the Front of our Journals, one of which I have seen employ a careful Reader a full Hour, can be to an honest Citizen I must confess I cannot understand: these weekly Venders of Sedition prejudice the State by raising strange Chimæras in the Brains 18 of those who are not competent Judges of the Subject, yet are ready to acquiesce in every Assertion, tho it is seconded by no Colour of Proof; 19 for Ignorance either believes every Thing, or it believes Nothing; it either leaps over Mountains, or stumbles at every Straw. The Study of Politics is of that intricate Nature, and the secret Springs by which the Wheels of State 20 move so difficult to be discerned, that it requires no slender Genius, nor a small Share of Knowledge, to gain an Insight into this Science; yet such is the foolish Forwardness of Mankind, especially of our Countrymen, that, tho you meet with thousands who will own their Ignorance in every other Way, you will scarce find one who is not in his own Opinion a tolerable Politician. This our epidemical Distemper 21 the Enemys to our present happy Establishment have sufficiently nourished to their own Ends. I have been often diverted, tho with a Mixture of Concern, 22 in seeing Half a Dozen of these mechanical Machi [ a ] vilians 23 s haking their Heads, 24 as a Sort of Approbation of the Author and Dislike of the Government, at a flagrant 25 Paragraph in one of the Papers against the Ministry, which some vociferous Member 26 hath been reading aloud to the Table; whereas had the honest Board seen the Affair set in a true Light, 27 they would not have wished to have had a Man of the Author's Principles for a Customer. The Dutch, 28 whose Wisdom in Government hath been the Theme of most of those whose Endeavours have been to depreciate our own, are extremely jealous of suffering their People to intermeddle in political Matters; nor indeed would such busy Heads, as our present Incendiarys, 29 find Food for their Lucubrations, 30 that wise State always prohibiting, with the strictest Severity, all Sorts of Libels, which are so many Firebrands, 31 and have often raised Flames 32 in a Commonwealth not to be extinguished without great Trouble, and often not without the Ruin of the State. Tho I have been always an Advocate for every Branch of Liberty, and among others for that of the Press, yet I conceive that this, as well as all other good Institutions, may, for Want of some Regulation, be in the End attended with evil Effects. 33 One of the Advantages arising from Liberty not abused is the Power of alarming the People when any Invasion on their Propertys is actually attempted, by producing to them the Fact or Facts by which the Attempt is evident; but to abuse in general Terms, to accuse without mentioning Particulars, and, in the vulgar Phrase, to call Names, 34 savour 35 more of the Licentiousness of Billingsgate 36 than of the Liberty of the Press. I never yet heared it denyed that a speaking Trumpet 37 is of great Service to alarm a Turnpike, when a Robbery hath been committed on the Highroad; but should a Person take it into his Head, 38 whenever an Express arrives from abroad, to cry out stop Thief, 39 and thereby interrupt him who is employed in the national Busyness, I apprehend that some Stop should be put 40 to that merry Gentleman's diverting himself 41 at the Expence of the Public, and of the Character of the Person so employed: and I do not see, if a Stop was put to our present weekly Incendiarys in a legal Way, why the Liberty of England may not be sayed to stand on a very sound Bottom; however I would not be understood 42 here to write against the Liberty of the Press, but the Abuse of it; and the great Men who have been most aspersed by the Abuse are most zealous for maintaining the Liberty of the Press; which will never fail while the present Ministry subsists. My present Design is to caution such of my Fellow-countrymen, 43 who cannot have had sufficient Opportunitys to improve in Politics, from giving too ready an Ear 44 to the Voices of Envy and Revenge, and to advise them to rest contented 45 under an Administration which hath hitherto defyed their Enemys to make good any Charge against them; 46 and whose chief Opponents have been the most flagitious 47 and most approved Enemys of their Country: I would counsel them to be satisfyed under the Blessings of Peace and Plenty tho they are not able to account for those Measures which have worked their Happyness. Cicero, esteemed a wise man in his Time, has left a just Reproof behind him to these political Enquirers. 48 Says he, * when Men in the inferior Arts guide themselves by Methods of their own, must the wise and they who act in the more exalted Spheres of Life be obliged to govern themselves by the Directions of the Multitude, and proceed by Maxims only which are obvious to their Eyes?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. An Epistle to Mr. Ellys the Painter Though he concludes with a tribute to Walpole that recalls Fielding's dedication to The Modern Husband, the motives of Cooke's anonymous friend in addressing these verses to Ellys were chiefly personal, not political. What, then, besides the fact that Fielding is almost certainly the author of the preceding essay, is the evidence within the poem itself that points to his authorship? To begin with, Fielding and "Jack" Ellys or Ellis (1701-57) were friends who had much in common: they belonged to a circle of clubbable wits and artists that included Cooke, Ralph, and Hogarth; they both frequented the amphitheaters, where champions like James Figg practised and taught the manly arts of boxing and swordplay; and they both, in their different ways, were actively involved with the Theatre Royal at Drury Lane. Ellys owned shares in the patent of the theater where Fielding was house playwright; and in September of this year of 1732, when Robert Wilks, one of the famous "triumvirate" of patentees died (the others being Colley Cibber and Barton Booth), Ellys would act as deputy for Wilks's widow in managing the theater. Twenty years later, in the Covent-Garden Journal (29 August 1752), Fielding's playful reference to Ellys in his capacity as keeper of the lions at the Tower suggests that their friendship lasted. Fielding was a generous man who "loved" his friends (his own word in a letter to Lyttelton on behalf of Edward Moore). It would be like him to write a poem celebrating Ellys's talents, especially at a time when Ellys was being ignored by critics and fellow artists alike. In a verse epistle to Bartholomew Dandridge in 1731, Joseph Mitchell had ranked that painter near the top of a list of fifteen contemporary "British Masters" from which Ellys was conspicuously excluded; and in his notebook for August 1731, George Vertue, in a similar list of gifted painters, also named Dandridge, but not Ellys. The poet of the "Epistle to Ellys," aiming to redress such slights, opens by declaring that lesser painters than his friend owe their inflated reputations chiefly to the influence of their sponsors: Charles Jervas to the praise of Pope, his friend and pupil; Bartholomew Dandridge to the puffing of (most likely) Lord Barrington, for whom he had this year painted a much admired equestrian portrait of the Prince of Wales. In contrast, these verses to Ellys, inspired by an "impartial Muse," are meant to "raise / A juster Trophy to thy Pencil's Praise"—"an honest Tribute . . . / Pay'd by a greater Friend to Truth than thee." It would be quite in character, then, for Fielding to pay this tribute to Ellys; that he indeed wrote the poem may be confidently inferred from evidence in the text itself. The evidence, however, cannot include the compliments paid, in order, to Sir Charles Wager (1666-1743), admiral; Anne Lennox (1703-89), countess of Albemarle; Benjamin Hoadly (1676-1761), bishop of Salisbury; William Wake (1657-1737), archbishop of Canterbury; and "th' undaunted Gladiator" James Figg (d. 1734). Fielding, of course, knew both Hoadly and Figg and elsewhere compliments them in his writings for their different qualities; but, as the footnote states, all these figures are in the poem because Ellys painted their portraits. Other compliments in the poem, however, are all to persons whom Fielding admired and praised: the Duke of Argyll (or Argyle, as Fielding spelled it); the Duke and Duchess of Richmond, his patrons; Lady Mary Chambers and the Countess of Shaftesbury ; his brilliant cousin, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; and, finally, the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, Lady Mary's friend and now Fielding's benefactor. Two other allusions—to the doting "Leander" and "the comic Phiz of M —" —were likely brought to mind by the recent successful production of Fielding's play, The Mock Doctor. And "Dorinda," the poet's "unkind" mistress, is also the unusual name of Fielding's ideal lady in the "Epistle to Lyttleton." Relevant details for all these will be found in the notes to the text. From the evidence presented, there should be little doubt that, considered separately, the "Epistle to Ellys" and the preceding prose " Observations on Government, etc." are by Fielding. Moreover, because we are assured by Cooke, editor of The Comedian, that both pieces are by the same "Friend," the force of the evidence is doubled. An Epistle to Mr. Ellys the Painter. While Jervass lives in Pope 's admiring Song, 1 And Dandridge borrows Fame from B—n's Tongue, 2 Shall no impartial Muse, my Ellys, raise A juster Trophy to thy Pencil's Praise? To others while fictitious Charms they give, Shall real Worth 3 in thee neglected live? Tho thou can'st need no Monument of mine, Tho on thy Canvas best thy Beautys shine, O! let this Verse an honest Tribute be, Pay'd by a greater Friend to Truth than thee. When (the great Work of thine excelling Hand!) We see the well-known Nymph or Hero stand, Where thoughtful * Wager wakes to guard our Isle, Where * Albemarle enchants us with a Smile, In * Hoadley where, and * Wake 's just Features, shine All the great Symptoms of their Souls divine, While skillful you each Passion's Mark unfold, We gaze, nor ask whose Pictures we behold: Nor is your Powr to these great Themes confin'd; You know to paint each Passion of the Mind: 4 Behold th' undaunted * Gladiator there; How just his Posture! and how fierce his Air! Behold his Looks impatient for the Fight; Cowards would fly, Argyle 5 approve, the Sight! Equal with thine no other Art we view, Who know'st decaying Nature to renew, Can'st Death's lamented Triumphs render vain, And bid departed Beauty live again. Here the fond Parent 6 of his Child bereft May view at least the much lov'd Image left. Leander 7 here, when Melesinda 's coy, Doats on the smiling Object of his Joy: And far, alas! by cruel Fate remov'd, (Too lovely Nymph! and O! too much belov'd!) Here, in the slightest Sketch, I fondly trace All the dear Sweetness of Dorinda 's $dagger; Face: 8 Tho Parents, Fortune, and tho she, conspire To keep far from me all my Soul's Desire, Still shall my ravish'd Eyes their Darling see, If not so beauteous, look more kind thro thee. O! let thine Art on future Times bestow Those Beautys which our own to Nature owe: Be no Lourissa on thy Canvas seen; Nor draw the comic Phiz 9 of M — 10 How Nature errs let other Pencils tell; Shew thine, more noble, how she can excel: Shew Richmond 's happy Pair 11 in Love entwin'd, Both grac'd alike in Person and in Mind; Well will such Subjects all thy Powrs engage, Honours to thee, and Glorys of their Age. While Hope of Gain the venal Fancy warms, The Painter often gives, not copys, Charms; But thou such wretched Compliments refrain; Who would paint S—l lovely paints in vain. Let perfect Art, like thine, those Subjects chuse Where bounteous Nature hath been most profuse: At Chambers 12 still thine Art incessant try, At Shaftsb'ry 's Mien, 13 and Wortley 's radiant Eye; 14 And, while some future Dryden 15 shall relate What Walpole 16 was, how wise, humane, and great, O! may the Patriot's mighty Image shine, In future Ages, by no Hand but thine.</field>

As in the case of New Essays, I am greatly indebted to Frederick G. Ribble not only for his constructive criticism of the manuscript of this essay, but also for adding to the number of parallels cited in the notes. 1 "hath": Though no longer considered an invariable feature of HF's style during this early period, he generally favored the archaic verb form hath, and its occurrence in six of seven instances in the two pieces in question supports the case for his authorship. 2 "stamped on every Face": Cf. TJ (IV.xi) "stamped in the Mind of Allworthy " (p. 196); JA (III.i) "bears the truest Stamp of Dignity on his Mind" (p. 190). *3 "AS Nature . . . all other Men": A variation of phrasing HF often used when treating the science of physiognomy, a favorite topic. Cf. KCM: "Nature doth really imprint sufficient Marks in the Countenance, to inform an accurate and discerning Eye" (Misc1, p. 161); JA (II.xvii) "Nature generally imprints such a Portraiture of the Mind in the Countenance, that a skilful Physiognomist will rarely be deceived" (p. 182); JVL "we may remark, in favour of the physiognomist . . . that nature is seldom curious in her works within, without employing some little pains on the outside. . . . A tyrant, a trickster, and a bully, generally wear the marks of their several dispositions in their countenances" (p. 57). *4 "so hath she [Nature] given to every Nation certain Characteristics different from one another": Cf. Ch (16 Feb. 1739/40) " Different Ages, as well as Nations, distinguish themselves by certain Characteristics from each other"; CGJ (2 Jun. 1752) "Charity is in fact the very Characteristic of this Nation" (p. 247); F (I.ii) "It was ever the Characteristic of this Nation." See also New Essays, p. 86 n. 33. *5 "Bent": Fielding elsewhere speaks of the natural inclination of a person or nation as a "bent". Cf. Ch (20 Nov. 1739) "the Bent . . . of his Genius"; (21 Feb. 1739/40) re the founding of hospitals, "this present Bent of our Genius"; TJ (XVIII.xi) "against the Bent of their natural Dispositions" (p. 968); ECIR "the general Bent of the People" (p. 96); CGJ (18 Jul. 1752) "a violent Bent or Disposition of the Mind to some particular Point" (p. 300). *6 "Cast": In the sense of a disposition of mind or character, "cast" was a recent usage in the eighteenth century; the earliest examples in the OED ( cast, sb XII.38b) are from 1711. HF also uses the word to refer to outward appearance (OED, cast, sb XII.37). Cf. TJ (III.ii) Blifil is "A Youth of so different a Cast from little Jones " (p. 118); (V.i) "the finest Woman in the World would lose all Benefit of her Charms, in the Eye of a Man who had never seen one of another Cast" (p. 212); Am (I.iii) "to perform Characters of no amiable Cast" (p. 28); JVL "the characters of Iago, Shylock, and others of the same cast" (p. 57). *7 "the Dutch . . . to Music": Cf. JSS, where HF similarly identifies the characteristic traits of these four nations, " French Finery, Italian Meats, / With German Drunkenness, Dutch Cheats" (Misc1, p. 117). In TP (11-18 Mar. 1746) he characterizes the French hangman as being "as well dress'd a Man as any in the Kingdom," and states that a Dutchman's "God is Gold" (p. 242). 8 "I believe": The parenthetical interjection "I believe," which occurs twice in this essay, is a hallmark of HF's style. The Chadwyck-Healey data base of eighteenth-century fiction (which includes Sh, JA, JWN, JW, TJ, and Am) records 527 instances of "I believe" for HF, 259 of which are of this specific interjection. 9 "what Idea a Foreigner must conceive": Cf. CGJ (4 Jan. 1752), where, as here, HF marvels at the "Multitude" of newspapers published in London: "When I survey all these wondrous Works . . . I am struck with no less Astonishment, than was the Foreigner when he saw Leadenhall Market; nor can I more conceive what becomes of all this Quantity of Paper, than he could find Consumers for so much Meat" (p. 14). *10 "at his first Entrance into": A favorite locution of HF's. Cf. JWN (I.viii) "on his first Entrance into Elysium" (Misc2, p. 36); JW (I.iv) "Wild's first Entrance into the World" (Misc3, p. 17); TJ (I.i) "at their first Entrance into the House" (p. 31); (XVIII.viii) "upon his first Entrance [into the room]" (p. 947); Am (XI.vi) "at her first Entrance [into the room]" (p. 480). *11 "our celebrated Coffee-houses . . . Journals in this City": In HF's Coffee-House Politician (1730), Politick, a retired tradesman in the City, is just such a character as the writer describes, though his insatiable appetite for news is for news of foreign, not domestic, affairs. With the writer's estimate of the number of newspapers published daily, especially on Saturday, cf. Politick's advice to his daughter Hilaret: "If you would be informed in these Matters, you must read all [the newspapers] that come out: about forty every Day, and some Days fifty: and of a Saturday about four score" (I.ii). Later, Politick regrets that he's had no time to read the " Lying Post " [HF's version of the Flying Post ] because he's been occupied poring over seventeen other papers, all of which he names (V.iii). *12 "The Spectator ": HF's admiration for The Spectator (1711-12), and for its authors Addison and Steele, was limitless; the paper would later serve as a model for his own periodical The Champion. The Ribbles (S44) list no fewer than thirty-three references to it in HF's writings. *13 "a great Enemy to": A favorite locution of HF's. C-H lists twenty-six occurrences in his fiction alone, including the following. JA (I.xvii), where Parson Adams refers to Whitefield, "I am myself as great an Enemy to the Luxury and Splendour of the Clergy as he can be" (p. 82); (III.iii) Adams again: "I have never been a greater Enemy to any Passion than that silly one of Vanity" (p. 214); (IV.viii) "he was a great Enemy to the Passions" (p. 309); JW (VI.i) "a great Enemy to this kind of Greatness " (Misc3, p. 139); TJ (V.x) "The Parson . . . was not only strictly Chaste . . . but a great Enemy to the opposite Vice in all others" p. 258); Am (II.viii) "the greatest Enemy to the French " (pp. 124-25). Also CS (13 May 1738) "as great an Enemy as I am to Noise" ( New Essays, p. 546). In addition to "great" HF's other adjectives modifying "Enemy" in this phrase are "bitter," "severest," "terrible," "dangerous," "utter." 14 "Zeal": C-H records thirty-three occurrences of "zeal" (21) and its related forms "zealot," "zealous," "zealously" (12) in HF's fiction. E.g., JW (III.xii) "his Zeal for Justice" (Misc3, p. 127); (IV.ii) "Zeal for a certain . . . Thing called Liberty" (Misc3, p. 140); TJ (VIII.vii) "Zeal for the Cause" (p. 427); (XVII.viii) "Zeal for the Match" (p. 901). 15 "I must own that": C-H records 294 occurrences of this imperative construction in HF's fiction: e.g., "I must say," "I must confess," "I must not . . . omit," etc. The form in question here ("I must own") occurs twenty times: e.g., JW (I.v, Misc3, p. 20); Am (III.x, p. 140; VI.iii, p. 241; VIII.x, p. 355; X.iv, p. 428). 16 "great Advantage . . . can reap": C-H records eleven occurrences of "reap" with "advantage" as direct object in HF's fiction, and four others substituting "Benefit," "Profit," "Happiness," and "Harvest" [the last used metaphorically]. *17 "those laborious political Essays": One of HF's favorite terms to denote dullness: cf. JW (III.ii) "those laborious Writers" (Misc3, p. 97); TJ (V.i) "in which we profess to be laboriously dull" (p. 215); JVL "the laborious much-read Doctor Zachary Grey" (p. 6). *18 "Chimæras in the Brains": References to the "Chimera" of classical mythology or to the adjective "chimerical" abound in HF's writings. Particularly close to the phrasing here are Ch (24 Jan. 1739/40) "nothing more than Chimeras of their own Brains"; Am V.ix) "some Chimeras now arose in his Brain" (p. 228). Cf. also UG (I.ii) "This must be some strange Chimera of his own"; TJ (XIV.i) "the Centaur, the Chimera, or any other Creatures of mere Fiction" (p. 742); CGJ (7 Jan. 1752) "a strange mixed Monster, not much unlike the famous Chimera of old" (p. 26). Besides these five examples, HF refers to the Chimera or uses the adjective "chimerical" at least a further nineteen times from The Modern Husband (I.ix) to A Comment on a Fragment of Lord Bolingbroke's Essays (1755): see New Essays, pp. 482-483 n. 7. 19 "Colour of Proof": Cf. JW (IV.xiv) where the ordinary of Newgate speaks of Plato and Aristotle: "Their whole Works are a strange Medley of the greatest Falshoods, scarce covered over with the Colour of Truth" (Misc3, p. 185); and Am (XI.ii), where Dr. Harrison comments on the nation's failure to reward merit: "It is an infamous Scandal . . . and I am heartily sorry it can be said even with a Colour of Truth" (p. 459). *20 "The Study of Politics . . . secret Springs . . . Wheels of State": HF often refers to the science of politics, or " Pollitricks " as he calls it in JW (II.v, Misc3, p. 67), as an intricate, clocklike machine whose workings only a true adept could comprehend. With the phrasing here, cf. TJ (VI.ii), where Mrs. Western mocks her brother: "You who are so great a Politician can . . . discover the secret Springs which move the great State Wheels in all the political Machines of Europe " (p. 275). Cf. also JW (I.i) the "secret Springs, various Windings , and perplexed Mazes" [of human nature] (Misc3, p. 7); TP (24 Dec. 1745) "the principal Wheels of this our political Machine" (p. 161); TJ (V.iv) "The World may indeed be considered as a vast Machine, in which the Wheels are originally set in Motion by those which are very minute, and almost imperceptible to any but the strongest Eye" (p. 225); Am (XII.ii) "one who pretended to manage the Wheels in the great State Lottery of Preferment" (p. 499). *21 "epidemical Distemper": HF several times represents the vogue of certain political, or literary, opinions with which he disagrees as an "epidemical Distemper" (or "Madness" or "Phrenzy") raging in the country: cf. CdGJ: "Evils" which, "like an epidemic Distemper, affected Society" (ECIR, p. 14). Also Sh: "an epidemical Phrenzy now raging in Town" (p. 306); JJ (5 Dec. 1747) "epidemic Frenzy" (p. 95); (5 Nov. 1748) "this dangerous, epidemical Madness" (p. 424); also Ch (11 Nov. 1739) "that Nation, where this [virtue] is epidemical." *22 "diverted, tho with a Mixture of Concern": Cf. TJ (XII.iv) though happy at finding Sophia's pocketbook, Jones "was affected with a Mixture of Concern" (p. 632); JW (I.v) "viewed, with a Mixture of Astonishment and Concern" (Misc3, p. 20); Am (I.vi) " Booth standing silent, with a Mixture of Concern and Astonishment in his Countenance" (p. 43). Also TJ (V.vi) "to ruminate, with a Mixture of Pain and Pleasure" (p. 237); (IX.iii) "with great Indignation, but with a Mixture of Pity, answered" (p. 502); (XVIII.x) "may reflect, not without some Mixture of Pleasure" (p. 960). 23 "mechanical Machi [ a ] vilians ": Though HF's reference to Niccolo Machiavelli, the most famous of all politicians, is not uncommon, few authors of the period can have admired him more: in JJ (8 Oct. 1748) HF calls him "the greatest of Politicians" (p. 404), and from The Modern Husband (III.iii) to the Covent-Garden Journal (21 Mar. 1752) he quotes from or alludes to Machiavelli no fewer than eighteen times. For a passage from TP in which HF invokes Machiavelli in a context similar to that of the present essay, see intro. In that essay (p. 239) HF also spells the adjective with an i instead of an e: Machiav i llian. *24 "shaking their Heads": In TP (4-11 Mar. 1746), a paper parallelling the argument of the present essay in several passages (see intro.), HF thus reports overhearing the leader of a party of Opposition supporters declare " That the Nation was undone; to which all the rest assented by shaking their Heads" (p. 237). Characters in HF's fiction also fall to shaking their heads for different reasons: to express disapproval (JA III.viii, p. 25; JWN I.iv, Misc2, p. 22; I.xv, p. 63), pain or anger (JA IV.xi, p. 322), hearty satisfaction at cracking a joke (II.xi, pp. 145-146). But with this gesture of the writer's "mechanical Machiavillian " signifying approbation of another's comment in affectation of deep understanding, cf. TJ (V.ix) Square's response to the doctor's opinion that Tom and Blifil are scoundrels: "the Philosopher, very sagaciously shaking his Head, agreed" (p. 255); and cf. also (XI.ii), the landlord of an inn, whom his neighbors believe to be "a very sagacious Fellow." He acquired this reputation by looking wise and by accompanying "his Words with certain explanatory Gestures, such as shaking, or nodding the Head," leaving "his Hearers to understand more than he expressed" (p. 576). 25 "flagrant": Cf. JWN (I.xiv) "those flagrant Proofs of his Inhumanity" (Misc2, p. 62); JJ (11 Jun. 1748) "The first of these flagrant Instances (indeed the most flagrant that any Age or Country hath produced" (p. 306). 26 "some vociferous Member": Cf. TJ (VII.xiv) "a vociferous Drawer" (p. 385); JVL "all the vociferous Inhabitants" (p. 24). Also TJ (II.ix) "made his Sister vociferous" (p. 111); (VII.xi) "they grew . . . very noisy and vociferous" (p. 366). *27 "set in a true Light": A favorite formula of HF's; C-H records 109 instances in the fiction alone. Cf. Sh (titlepage) "and all the matchless Arts of that young Politician set in a true and just Light"; Am (I.ii) "another Illustration . . . will set my Intention in still a clearer Light" (p. 20). 28 "The Dutch ": During 1728 and 1729, when he was a student at Leiden, HF would have had opportunities to witness at first hand the Dutch policy of censorship to which the writer refers. 29 "our present Incendiarys" [repeated later in the essay]: HF also uses this term for antiministerial writers in JJ (26 Mar. 1748) "these Incendiaries" (p. 212). *30 "Lucubrations": Frederick Ribble notes that this is HF's favorite term for describing , as here, the opinions of periodical journalists: see Ch (26 Jan. 1739/40), TP (5 Nov. 1745, p. 107), JJ (3 Sep. 1748, p. 380), CGJ (4 Jan. 1752, p. 13). Cf. also TJ (VIII.xv) the Man of the Hill "made use" of the night "for his Walks and Lucubrations" (p. 486). 31 "Firebrands": Cf. JW (I.iii) Hecuba dreamed "that she was delivered of a Firebrand that set all Troy in Flames" (Misc3, p. 13). "Firebrand" is the name of the priest who murders Common Sense in Pasquin (1736). *32 "raised Flames": C-H records eighteen instances in the fiction alone where HF uses "Flame" or "Flames" in a metaphorical sense. With the specific idea of raising a flame, cf. JA (I.xviii) "he did indeed raise a Flame in her, which required the Care of a Surgeon to cool" (p. 86); JW (I.xii) "in whose tender Breast his Passion has raised a more ardent Flame than that of any of his Rivals had been able to raise" (Misc3, p. 39). Cf. also Am (II.i) "so foolishly did I imagine I could be Master of a Flame to which I was every Day adding Fuel" (p. 68). *33 "Liberty . . . attended with evil Effects": For examples of this favorite locution, see New Essays, p. 86, n. 31. HF would later argue strenuously against any attempt by the government to "regulate" the stage, which, he warned, would prove to be a first step toward curtailing the liberty of the press. When, however, he later became principal propagandist for the Pelham ministry, he would take the essayist's own view that the abuse of the government by Opposition writers warranted regulation of the press. In JJ (12 Mar. 1748) he declared: "I am very sorry to see, in an Age when the Liberty of the Press is pretended to be in Danger, such an Abuse made of this Liberty, as must give the greatest Encouragement to its Enemies (if there were any such) to attempt a Restraint of it: For wise and good Men will, by these Means, be brought to esteem this Liberty rather as a Nusance, than as a valuable Privilege to the Society" (p. 198). *34 "the vulgar Phrase . . . call Names": C-H records 85 occurrences in HF's fiction alone of "vulgar" or "vulgarly"; of these, 38 occur in phrases referring to terms used in colloquial speech—e.g. "vulgarly called," "vulgarly named," "as the Vulgar express it"— including seven instances of the essayist's "in the vulgar Phrase," as follows: JW (II.ii) "in the vulgar Phrase, cheating" (Misc3, p. 54); TJ (IV.v) "would, in the vulgar Phrase, be crying Roast-meat " (p. 165); (VIII.ii) "(according to the vulgar Phrase) struck all of a Heap" (p. 410); (IX.iii) "In the vulgar Phrase, she had taken up the Broomstick" (p. 501); (X.ix) "began, in the vulgar Phrase, to smell a Rat" (p. 563); (XII.xii) "He was . . . according to the vulgar Phrase, whistle-drunk" (pp. 624-625); (XII.xiii) "as the vulgar Phrase is, . . . drew in his Horns" (p. 677). On the specific vulgar phrase "to call Names," see note 36. *35 "savour": This olfactory metaphor was a favorite of HF's, who, for example, used it in much the same context in Ch (10 Dec. 1739) "The Licentiousness of some modern Performances savouring too much of the old Comedy." Also, among many other examples: JA (IV.viii) "it savours too much of the Flesh" (p. 310); KCM "seems to savour of Ill-nature" (Misc1, p. 160); JW (I.vi) "a Custom . . . savouring of the Sneaking-Budge " (Misc3, p. 27); TJ (VII.vi) "these Views . . . may seem to savour too much of Malevolence" (p. 346); CdGJ "it seems rather to savour of Ostentation than Utility" (ECIR, p. 12). *36 " Billingsgate ": HF often refers to the foul and abusive language of the porters and fishmongers of Billingsgate, and at least twice with reference to the essayist's "vulgar Phrase, to call Names": JJ (13 Feb. 1748) "The Defendant [the Corporation of Billingsgate] . . . urged, that when these Invectives proceeded to the Use of opprobrious Terms, and to downright calling Names [emphasis added], such Works had always been adjudged to be the Property of Billingsgate" (p. 160); CGJ (3 Mar. 1752) referring to a species of false wit: "it never fails to propagate gross Abuse and Scandal; so far indeed as to inspire Men to call Names [emphasis added], and to deal in all the Language of Billingsgate" (p. 128). Other references to the language of Billingsgate: JJ (5 Dec. 1747, p. 96; 12 Mar. 1748, p. 200; 16 Apr., p. 237; 11 Jun., p. 307; 2 Jul., p. 328); TJ (XI.viii, p. 603; XVIII.ii, p. 919); CGJ (11 Jan. 1752, p. 32; 25 Jan., p. 56; 25 Nov., p. 379). 37 "a speaking Trumpet": A sort of megaphone: cf. JW (IV.ix) "One of the Sailors . . . with the Assistance of a speaking Trumpet, informed us" (Misc3, p. 165); JVL "his voice, which was as loud as a speaking trumpet" (p. 83). *38 "take it into his Head": A favorite locution of HF's: cf. JWN (I.xviii) "This Gentleman took it into his Head to list under my Banner" (Misc2, p. 78); TJ (XI.iv) "if they take it into their Heads to go to the Devil" (p. 585); Am (II.ix) "I took it into my Head to marry" (p. 95); (III.iii) "This young Fellow had taken it into his Head to go into the Army" (p. 107); (III.viii) "When my Wife had once taken it into her Head " (p. 125); (VI.vi) "you are liable to take such things into your Head " (p. 251) [emphasis added]. 39 "cry out stop Thief ": Cf. TJ (VIII.xi) "called out . . . Stop Thief" (p. 458); Am (XI.vii) "He instantly gave the Alarm of `stop Thief' " (p. 483); (XII.vi) "Action in the Street, accompanied with the frequent Cry of `stop Thief' " (p. 519). *40 "some Stop should be put": A passive form of "put a stop to," a favorite locution of HF's appearing three lines below this. Both constructions occur in JA (I.v) "an Accident . . . put a stop to these agreeable Walks" (p. 28); (III.iii) "This Career was soon put a stop to by my Surgeon" (p. 206); (IV.x) "something now happened, which put a stop to Dick 's Reading" (p. 320). Cf. also JW (I.vi) "an Accident . . . put a Stop to his Continuance in a Way of Life" (Misc3, p. 27); (IV.i) "several . . . thought it principally their Duty to put a Stop to the future Progress of our Hero" (p. 139); (IV.ii) "Modesty . . . put a Stop to the Torrent of Compliments" (p. 142); (IV.xiv) "the Punch . . . put a Stop to his Reading " (p. 185); TJ (IV.ix) "Fortune . . . put a Stop to her Promotion" (p. 187); (V.v) "an Accident put a Stop to her Tongue" (p. 229); (VIII.viii) "she put a Stop to his swearing" (p. 433). *41 "that merry Gentleman's diverting himself": Dr. Ribble notes that HF often used "merry" ironically to describe malicious, ill-natured "fun": cf. JWN (I.ii) "I am surprized . . . that you did not divert yourself by . . . playing some merry Tricks with the Murderer' " (Misc2, p. 10); JA (Preface) "the Comedy of Nero, with the merry Incident of ripping up his Mother's Belly" (p. 7 [italics reversed]); TJ (XV.iii), referring to a club of liars: "every Member should, within the twenty-four Hours, tell at least one merry Fib" (p. 789). 42 "I would not be understood": Cf. JA (II.xiii) "I would not be understood to mean Persons literally born higher" (p. 156); TJ (V.vi) "I would not be understood" to have meant to offend (p. 238); Am (III.vi) "I would not be understood . . . to reflect on Mrs. Booth " (p. 119). 43 "Fellow-countrymen": HF was fond of using various compound forms of "Fellow-": "Fellow-Citizens" (Ch [22 Nov. 1739]), "Fellow-Creatures" (TJ [I.iii, p. 41]), "Fellow-Soldiers" ([JWN I.xxi, Misc2, p. 93]), "Fellow-Sufferers" (TJ [XIII.ii, p. 691]); "Fellow Travellers" (JW [III.iii, Misc3, p. 98]). *44 "giving too ready an Ear": Cf. Am (IX.i) "This worthy Clergyman . . . gave a ready Ear to all which Amelia said" (p. 359); JA (II.iv) "she inclined so attentive an Ear to every Compliment" (p. 103). 45 "to rest contented": Am (IV.iii) "forced to rest contented with his Ignorance" (p. 164); JVL "I was obliged . . . to rest myself contented" (p. 25). *46 "defyed their Enemys to make good any Charge against them": One of HF's favorite formulas: JA (IV.vi) " `my Conduct may defy Malice itself to assert so cursed a Slander' " (p. 297); TJ (XIV.iii) " `I defy any body . . . to say' " (p. 752); Am (I.ix) " `I defy the World to say' " (p. 58). See also JA (pp. 62, 112, 234 [2]), TJ (pp. 185, 317, 506, 600), and additional references in New Essays, p. 138 nn. 29, 32. *47 "flagitious": This otherwise rarely used word recurs in HF's works: Ch (6 Mar. 1739/40) "private Scandal . . . of so flagitious a kind"; JWN (I.xv) "the most impudent and flagitious manner" (Misc2, p. 64); TP (12 Nov. 1745) "guilty of the most flagitious Acts" (p. 118); (28 Jan.-4 Feb. 1746) "the most flagitious Schemes" (p. 210); (6-13 May 1746) "one of the most flagitious Crimes" (p. 285); CdGJ "a Crime . . . carried to so flagitious a Height" (ECIR, p. 29); ECIR "a cruel and flagitious Act" (p. 117); "the most impudent and flagitious of [wretches]" (p. 121); CGJ (8 Feb. 1752) "the Trial of very flagitious Offences" (p. 84). *48 " Cicero . . . these political Enquirers": This same passage from Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (V.xxxvi.104) also served HF as the epigraph for TP (4-11 Mar. 1746), which treats much the same theme as this essay (see intro.); it served him again as the epigraph for JJ (6 Feb. 1748). It is possible, however, that the editor Cooke, a classicist, was responsible for this concluding paragraph. Besides the anomalous use of "has" (instead of "hath," as in the five preceding instances), the writer quotes Cicero from the conventional text, reading "numerosque moderantur" and "verissimum," whereas HF in the TP and JJ has "modulantur" and "rectum," respectively—variants to be found in the 1566 edition of Cicero's Opera by Lambin, which HF owned (Ribbles C29): see Miriam Austin Locke, ed. The True Patriot ( University of Alabama Press, 1964), p. 171. * An Tibicines, iique qui Fidibus utuntur, suo, non Multitudinis, Arbitrio, Cantus Numerosque moderantur, Vir sapiens, multò Arte majore præditus, non quid verissimum fit, sed quid velit Vulgus, exquiret? Tusc. Quæst, Lib. 5. *1 " Pope 's admiring Song": Pope's verse epistle to the painter Charles Jervas, his friend and teacher in the art of painting, was published in 1716. In his unpublished cantos burlesquing the Dunciad (1729/30) HF, mocking Pope and his verse form, describes the palace of the god of Rhime: "With J[ervas'] Paintings all the Walls were hung" (Grundy, p. 226). Perhaps to please his cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (see below, n. 14), among whose papers the manuscript of the cantos was found, HF in this early period was critical of Pope, who also appears as Codrus, Juvenal's poor poet, both in the cantos and in HF's poem "To John Hayes, Esq." (Misc1, pp. 51-53), published in 1743 but written earlier. 2 " Dandridge . . . B—n 's Tongue": Bartholomew Dandridge (1691-c. 1755), painter, who, like Ellys, studied under Kneller and was Ellys's more successful rival for fame. The poet most likely refers to Dandridge's having this year painted for William Wildman, viscount Barrington (1717-93), an equestrian portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales, which was highly praised. (See George Vertue, Vertue Note Books, vol. 3, The Walpole Society, 22 [1933-34], p. 57.) If Barrington is meant, the long dash concealing the name prevents spoiling the meter with an eleventh syllable. 3 "real Worth": TJ (XIII.i) "the real Worth which once existed in my Charlotte " (p. 683). * Pictures drawn by Mr. Ellys. * Pictures drawn by Mr. Ellys. * Pictures drawn by Mr. Ellys. * Pictures drawn by Mr. Ellys. 4 "paint each Passion of the Mind": Cf. HF's "To John Hayes, Esq." (Misc1, p. 52), referring to Titian's skill: "So the Great Artist diff'ring Passions joins, / And Love with Hatred, Fear with Rage combines." * Mr. James Figg drawn in the Posture of a Gladiator by Mr. Ellys. *5 " Argyle ": John Campbell (1680-1743), second duke of Argyll (or Argyle, as HF invariably spelled the name). As brigadier general he served courageously in Marlborough's campaigns, in which HF's father also took part; and as commander of the forces in north Britain, he was instrumental in suppressing the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. In 1732 and for some time after, he was a member of Walpole's administration, but by 1740 he was in Opposition. He was for HF the very type of the man of courage: see Ch (29 Jan. 1739/40); TG (Misc1, pp. 25, 28), and EC (Misc1, p. 152). Argyll subscribed to HF's Miscellanies (1743), a set on royal paper. 6 "fond Parent": JA (IV.xvi) "their fond Parents" (p. 344); TJ (VII.vi) "that fond Parent" (p. 346); Am (III.xi) "a fond Parent" (p. 141). *7 " Leander ": The name HF gave to Charlotte's true love in The Mock Doctor, which opened at Drury Lane on 23 June of this year. † An unfinished Picture of Miss D. W. by Mr. Ellys. *8 " Dorinda 's Face": Dorinda, the poet's (unusual) name for a certain "Miss D. W." for whom he sighs in vain, was also at about this time the name HF gave to the woman he loved. In his unpublished verse "Epistle to Lyttleton," written in March or April 1733, he would pay "Dorinda" a pretty compliment. Referring to Lyttelton's poem Advice to a Lady (Feb. 1733), he substitutes her name for that of Lyttelton's heroine, Belinda: To thee [Lyttelton], the Lover blest shall Pleasures owe Which uninstructed Beauty can't bestowe. What they Should prove, Coquettes and Prudes shall see; And what She is, Dorinda read, in thee. (Grundy, p. 240) *9 "Phiz": HF often used this colloquial abbreviation for "physiognomy": Ma (p. 9), AF (III, p. 76), US (8 Oct. 1737, New Essays, p. 542), PRS (Misc1, p. 195), JJ (23 Jan. 1748, p. 138). *10 " M —": Most likely a reference to Dr. John Misaubin, a French physician practising medicine in London, who trumpeted the virtues of his pills as a cure for venereal disease. In April 1732 Hogarth, a close friend of Fielding and Ellys, captured his "comic Phiz" in Plate 5 of A Harlot's Progress, where he is the thin quack who quarrels with his portly colleague Dr. Rock about which of their nostrums is the more efficacious. The book of HF's Mock Doctor (published 11 July 1732) is dedicated to Misaubin, and in the play itself Gregory (played by Theophilus Cibber) impersonates him when he poses as a French physician. Later, Misaubin's incompetence and vanity are mocked in TJ (V.vii, pp. 240-241 and XIII.ii, p. 688). *11 " Richmond 's happy Pair": Charles Lennox (1701-50), second duke of Richmond, and his wife Sarah (1706-51). HF dedicated to him both his comedy The Miser (staged at Drury Lane in Feb. 1733, published 13 Mar.) and his poem Of Good Nature (Misc1, p. 30), and paid him another compliment in Letter XLI of Sarah Fielding's Familiar Letters (1747). In Of Good Nature, HF also admires the beauty of the duchess, whom he links, as in this poem, with the Countess of Shaftesbury, praising " Shaftsb'ry's Air" and admiring "the Snow that whitens Richmond 's Breast" (Misc1, p. 35); in "The Queen of Beauty" she is the most beautiful woman at Court (Misc1, p. 79). In the "Epistle to Lyttleton" (written Mar.Apr . 1733) the Duchess of Richmond and Countess of Shaftesbury again appear together and are joined, as here, by Lady Mary Chambers: "Thine [Lyttelton] be the pleasing Task to Form the Fair, / To join a Chamber's Soul with Shaftsb'ry's Air," while "Richmond leads in Triumph all Mankind" (p. 240). The duchess was a subscriber to HF's Miscellanies. *12 " Chambers ": Lady Mary (d. 1735), daughter of the second earl of Berkeley and wife of Thomas Chambers. In the "Epistle to Lyttleton" (Grundy, p. 240), as here, she is complimented together with the Countess of Shaftesbury and the Duchess of Richmond. *13 " Shaftsb'ry 's Mien": Susanna Cooper, neé Noel (d. 1758), wife of the fourth earl of Shaftesbury, who, as first cousin to James Harris of Salisbury, was on friendly terms with HF. In his poem Of Good Nature, " Shaftsb'ry 's Air" complements the Duchess of Richmond's snow white breast (see above, note 11). In HF's "Epistle to Lyttleton" (1733), all four of the "Ellys" poet's beauties are complimented: Shaftesbury, Richmond, Lady Mary Chambers , and HF's cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (Grundy, pp. 240-241); for the last see note 14 below. The countess returned HF's compliments by subscribing to two sets of the Miscellanies (1743) on royal paper. *14 " Wortley 's . . . Eye": Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762), HF's second cousin, among whose papers Isobel Grundy discovered the unpublished manuscripts of his burlesque of Pope's Dunciad (1729/30) and the "Epistle to Lyttleton" (Mar.-Apr. 1733), where will be found HF's compliments to Lady Mary's "Eyes" as well as to the other three beauties mentioned by the "Ellys" poet (see above, notes 11-13). Indeed, HF's purpose in writing the "Epistle to Lyttleton" was to defend his cousin from Pope's slanders on her character in his First Satire of the Second Book of Horace Imitated (published 15 Feb. 1733). HF had dedicated to her his first play, Love in Several Masques (1728), and at his request she would later criticize an early draft of The Modern Husband (1732). 15 " Dryden ": John Dryden (1631-1700). HF appreciated Dryden's greatness as a poet (see TG, in Misc1, p. 24), and, in a metaphorical history of the progress of wit in England, HF crowns him "King" of the period of the Restoration (CGJ [21 Mar. 1752], p. 153). *16 " Walpole ": Sir Robert Walpole (1676-1745), prime minister. For a brief summary of HF's relations with Walpole from the beginning of his literary career to this year of 1732, see the introduction to this essay. The first clear sign of his gratitude for Walpole's patronage was HF's fulsome dedication of The Modern Husband to him (Feb. 1732). More expansively and in prose, the Dedication anticipates the language of these concluding lines of the "Epistle to Ellys," where the poet lauds the prime minister for being "wise, humane, and great" and calls him "the Patriot." The lines are an abridgment in verse of the close of the Dedication, where "The Muses" (perhaps through "some future Dryden, " as the "Ellys" poet foresees) "shall remember . . . the wise Statesman[,] the generous Patron, the stedfast Friend, and the true Patriot; but above all that Humanity and Greatness of Temper , which shine thro' all your Actions."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">WHAT DID ANNA BARBAULD DO TO SAMUEL RICHARDSON'S CORRESPONDENCE? A STUDY OF HER EDITING by William McCarthy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Anna Letitia Barbauld's biography of Samuel Richardson still enjoys the respect of Richardsonians, her editing of his correspondence has been much less fortunate. Comparing the manuscript letters now held in the Forster Collection and elsewhere with the texts published in 1804 under Barbauld's editorship as The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson, Richardsonians have seen differences that make a modern editor cringe. 1 The printed texts are usually abridged, without notice; they are often reworded in small ways; their spelling and punctuation are generally altered; a number of them are misdated; and twenty-five of them appear to have been spliced together out of perhaps fifty-six separate letters. One editor, contemplating the correspondence of Richardson and Edward Young as printed in Correspondence , accused Barbauld of forgery. 2 Faced with the differences between manuscript and 1804 texts, Richardsonians today regard Barbauld's edition as (at best!) worthless, and have resolved to prepare a new one. 3 There is a further reason for a new edition. As Peter Sabor pointed out years ago, Correspondence has long been regarded, erroneously, as a complete edition. In fact the 442 letters represented in it, besides being abridged, amount to only about a quarter of the Richardson correspondence known to exist today, and a still smaller proportion of what existed in 1804. Although it fills five and a half volumes, Barbauld's is a selected correspondence—as its title page declares, and as she herself stated in her preface to it. She regarded her editorial task as primarily (in her words) "the necessary office of selection." 4 That we need a complete edition of the Richardson correspondence, edited to modern scholarly standards by modern methods, is not in doubt. A good place to begin, however, is with a fresh look at Barbauld's editing. As her biographer-in-progress I am obliged to consider her Richardson work as part of her life. Barbauld's was the first large publication of Richardson's letters, and in the course of that labor she also became his first biographer: as Richardson's work was an event in her history, so hers was an event—even a defining event—in his. And so it will remain, for there are about 280 letters of which Correspondence seems to be the only surviving text; for them, Richardsonians are stuck with her work, like it or not. It therefore behooves us to try to understand what she did, and why she did it. Barbauld's biographer can bring to that effort information not possessed by Richardsonians. Moreover, going through the letters from the point of view, as it were, of Barbauld herself is a way to raise awareness of what happened to them before they came to her. Hitherto it has been assumed that any difference at all between manuscript and printed text must have been Barbauld's personal doing: if even a comma was changed, she changed it. 5 That assumption agrees poorly with the known practices of eighteenth-century publishing, but it could not be specifically refuted as long as no one could distinguish her marks on the manuscripts from other people's. Richardsonians could recognize Richardson's marks on them; to recognize hers, a Barbauldian is required. 6 To appreciate the importance of distinguishing her marks from the others, and the problem faced by any editor of the letters (including Barbauld herself), we must recall the state in which the letters came to her. 7 At his death Richardson left seven or eight volumes of letters (according to one report; they may well have been more than that). 8 It is well known that late in life he reviewed his correspondence with an idea of publishing parts of it as commentary on his novels. Anyone who has read Tom Keymer's book on Clarissa and her readers will know how much Richardson's correspondence revolves around people's responses to his fictions; 9 Richardson was perfectly right, although rather ahead of his age, to project an edition of it. He worked through the letters with care, making copies and having copies made, marking passages for deletion, disguising names, and making stylistic changes. Most of the surviving manuscript versions of letters that Barbauld published show some sign of Richardson's prior work on them—a fact to which I shall return. The manuscripts are a mix of original letters and copies by Richardson and several copyists; thus letters by one and the same writer may appear in three different hands, with further annotations and changes in Richardson's. (Indeed, they show two distinct Richardson hands: pre- and post-Parkinson's.) A single letter may itself exhibit three or four hands. There are indications of further work on the letters by someone in Richardson's family in 1780. 10 Thus marked and re-marked, they would have posed interpretive challenges to any outsider looking at them for the first time, even in 1804. In February 1804 the letters were bought by the bookseller Richard Phillips, and they remained his property until he sold them at auction in 1828. 11 He immediately hired Barbauld to make a selection for print, and the volumes of manuscripts were delivered to her around February 20. 12 Behold her then, the first person outside Richardson's family to leaf through this huge collection of sometimes puzzling documents. How does she approach it? Barbauld was a good historian (history was one of the subjects she had taught at Palgrave School twenty years earlier), and the bedrock of history, in her mind, was chronology. 13 So she set out, as she explained to Phillips, to "have the letters in chronological date order." At least within each correspondence 14 Probably while doing that, she also chose the letters that looked to her most worth printing. The next step would have been to mark the passages in them that were not to be printed. For this purpose, and to distinguish her deletions from Richardson's, she used green ink. The green-ink deletion strokes on the letters—neat single lines drawn vertically or horizontally across the passages to be deleted—can be ascribed to her because occasionally she also wrote a word or two in green, and thus testified to her hand. 14 Her typical markings on the manuscripts look, then, like those in Figure 1, which also illustrates the presence of other hands. This page came to Barbauld already bearing three hands. The hand of the letter is Aaron Hill's. The date at the top was written by one of Richardson's copyists. Richardson himself wrote the note at the head commenting on the letter and advising himself to "lower" its praise of him. Barbauld deletes that note and enters a note identifying the correspondent: "Mr Hill to R." If the image were in color, it would be seen that in this instance most of the deletion marks are not hers; they are Richardson's , except for the middle vertical stroke across lines 1-3, the short vertical stroke across lines 20-21, and the horizontal stroke following the word "temptation" in line 19. She inserts "my dear Friend" in line 4 to make up for the salutation deleted in lines 1-2. At the ends of letters she often curtails the closings. In Figure 2, having deleted the sentence which led into it, she rewrites the close: "I am," the apostrophe "s" tacked onto the first "Your," and "&amp;c A Hill" are hers. Observe that Richardson—or somebody—preceded her: the vertical stroke deleting lines 13-14, and the "Your" in line 15, are not hers. Neither on these nor on other pages has Barbauld changed punctuation or other accidentals, except occasionally to capitalize a word that opens a Figure 1.

Forster MSS 48.E.7 (Vol. XIII.2), fol. 47 r , from Aaron Hill to Richardson, 13 April 1741. Reproduced from Harvester Microforms edition (1986) by permission of V &amp; A Picture Library. probably, because she expected the printer to normalize them. Her entrusting accidentals to the printer is evident in one of her few extended annotations to a letter: Princeton University Library MS 14598 (Richardson to Aaron Hill, 29 October 1742). There she reinserts in her own hand a passage she had at first deleted, and the text in Correspondence adds punctuation not specified by her hand. 16 In expecting the printer to normalize she behaved like many other writers, then and later: for example Edward Young, writing to Richardson himself, who acted as Young's printer: "I shall, dear sir, look on your manner of lettering[,] stopping, &amp;c. as half the composition ." 18 To charge Barbauld with the accidentals of Correspondence is to blame her for something over which she did not assume—and probably was not expected to assume—jurisdiction. The responsible party was the printer; or, in this case, the printers, for Phillips distributed the six volumes among five different printing-houses. 19 This, then, is how Barbauld typically marked up a manuscript. On some points her work shows an effort to get back to the original texts: thus she reinserts names that Richardson had deleted or disguised in the Lady Bradshaigh and Wescomb letters, and she must have instructed the press (by her use of contrasting ink) to observe her deletions rather than Richardson's, for that is what the printed texts usually do, except when hers reinforce his. She sought information about Richardson's forty-four correspondents, interviewed people, sent inquiries, consulted reference works, and waited—by her own account—"to the last moment" for some promised information on Lady Bradshaigh that never came. 20 She was engaged in a project analogous in some respects to Johnson's Lives of the Poets or her own British Novelists later; had it been allowed to run its course, her work would have taken considerable time. But her work was not allowed to run its course. Phillips, the owner of the letters and the publisher of the edition, was a difficult man to work for. Domineering and argumentative, he regarded the authors who carried out "his" projects as little more than hired hands and oversaw their work with deep suspicion. 21 His letters to Barbauld do not survive, but one of hers to him does; from it we can gather that by 20 April, just two months after he delivered the manuscripts to her, Phillips was already nagging her for copy and accusing her of neglecting his financial interest. At the same time, he has unexpectedly sent her more letters to edit. "I have only waited," she pleads, "from my solicitude to have the letters in chronological order which beginning two or three Vol. without knowing how much one will take will I fear destroy, &amp; from y r sending new matter which must alter the proportion taken of the whole" (i.e., her selection from the letters). With this letter she sends copy towards what became the first 119 pages of Volume 4, holding the rest back till "the return of the first proof sheet I have from any body." She has also just sent "matter . . . to begin the 3 d Vol"—i.e. part of the RichardsonThomas Edwards correspondence—and she demands that Phillips send her " clean sheets of each . . . &amp; always the proofs. " 22 The letter intimates a tense working relationship between her and Phillips, he pressing for quick copy, she trying to fend him off long enough to do a careful job. In the end Phillips must have prevailed: the Correspondence, all six volumes of it, including her two-hundred-page life of Richardson, was published by, or even before, June first. 23 The entire time Phillips allowed her to work on the edition amounted, in the end, to three months at most. Given this hurried production, with copy being distributed among five different printing houses, it should perhaps be no surprise that for most of the printed letters no manuscript texts survive. 24 But there is much to learn from the manuscripts that do survive. In the Forster Collection and elsewhere are held 80 letters marked by Barbauld as if for print, but not printed, and another 111 that correspond to letters actually printed. Appendix A below lists 104 of the 111 letters corresponding to those that were printed; Appendix B lists the 80 not printed. It looks, then, as if Barbauld wanted to print more letters than Phillips would allow. 25 Even though not printed, the 80 marked letters give further evidence of her editorial style and method. They are therefore taken into account in the conclusion to this paper. More important, however, are the inferences that can now be drawn about the published texts themselves. Knowing Barbauld's markings on them, we can collate the manuscripts with the printed texts and see how closely those texts observe her markings. The results of my collation of 104 letters with their counterparts in Correspondence are presented in summary form in Appendix A below. They show that the printed texts observe Barbauld's markings closely—but that they also very often differ from the manuscripts in ways that cannot be traced to marks by Barbauld or anyone else. The differences are verbal (sometimes clearly misreadings by compositors but also sometimes different phrasings and added words) and deletional (usually of just a few words, but in one case the absence of almost one-third of a letter, in the manuscript of which Barbauld had marked no deletions at all). 26 To attribute all these differences to one person would be rash: the production of a six-volume book involves many people besides its nominal editor. Moreover , it would be rash even to assume that all the differences result from interventions during the book's production. Many, however, clearly do result from intervention. Volume 3 presents good evidence that between Barbauld's marking of the manuscripts and the final printing of the book, the text underwent further changes. For Volume 3 also, surviving manuscripts at least hint at Barbauld's preferred working method—and its likely frustration by Phillips. At the lower right corner of Figure 3. Forster MSS 48.E.6 (Vol. XII.1), fol. 116 r , from Thomas Edwards to Richardson, 20 November 1754. Reproduced from Harvester Microforms edition (1986) by permission of V &amp; A Picture Library. Figure 3 (a letter by Thomas Edwards) appears a circled notation, "Vol 3 F 97." This is one of a number of such notations appearing among the Forster manuscripts, but only on letters that were printed in Correspondence. Presumably made in the printing houses, they mark the beginnings of gatherings—either predictively, so that type-setting could begin with any sheet in a volume, or actually, as type was being set. 27 With two exceptions, the notations do correspond to the beginnings of gatherings in the printed volumes: thus, in Volume 3 gathering F starts on page 97, at the word bracketed on this manuscript leaf. Whether made before or during composition, the marks imply that the printer worked from copy that was complete and final to that point. But collation of the Forster manuscripts that correspond to Volume 3, pages 1-96, with the printed text reveals a discrepancy equivalent to thirty-three manuscript lines of text. Between Barbauld's markup of the letters and the printer's accurate notation of this gathering, there must have occurred at least some of the additional changes described above as appearing in the printed texts and including, in this case, the deletion of thirty-three manuscript lines. Recall that Barbauld, when she sent the first Edwards letters to Phillips, asked for " clean sheets of each." I take this to mean that she wanted clean copy, transcripts of the letters that would embody her deletions. She may have wanted them to read proof against. 28 Did she also, however, mark them further and send them to the press as copy? This conjecture allows the inference that the Forster counterparts of Volume 3, pages 1-96, did not serve as copy for the printer—an inference that would explain both the thirty-three line discrepancy and the fact that none of them bears a gathering notation, although they equal four gatherings' worth of printed text. 29 On reflection, it would make perfect sense for Barbauld to have worked in this way. By using transcripts, she would have protected the original letters from printing-house damage and reduced the risk of compositorial error in setting the texts; it was a responsible way to work. The appearance of gathering marks on the manuscripts for pages 97 and later suggests, then, either that she succumbed to Phillips's demands for speed and began sending him the original manuscripts as copy or—more likely—that Phillips himself in his impatience to publish began passing her marked originals directly to the press, ignoring her request for transcripts. His impatience may also have driven her to cut corners: two of the last letters in the Edwards correspondence show manuscript evidence of conflation. 30 I emphasize manuscript evidence; for all that Barbauld has been charged with freely combining different letters, very few of the manuscripts actually show her doing that. (Those that do are identified in Appendices A and B. The RichardsonYoung correspondence—at least the Young side of it—may have presented exceptional temptations to conflate; I discuss the evidence in Appendix C.) The inference of transcripts, however, still leaves questions. If Barbauld had transcripts made, did she herself then change them in the ways I have described? Some kinds of changes, such as further deletions, are probably hers; but other small changes would have occurred by error in the course of transcription, and, being pressed for time, she would have overlooked them. (If Phillips's transcriber worked in the same way that printers worked, she would not in any case have received the originals back with the transcripts and would not have been able to check them for accuracy. 31 ) The inference of transcripts also cannot explain the fact that similar small differences appear between the printed texts and the manuscripts that we know served as copy for them. Any manuscript bearing a gathering notation certainly saw the inside of a printing house, yet collation of those manuscripts with Correspondence also turns up differences. It seems necessary, then, to infer changes in the very process of printing, or in proofs, or in both. Besides the question of editorial intervention between Barbauld and the press (whether by her or by someone else), however, there is the near certainty that some 1804 texts differ from surviving manuscripts because the surviving manuscripts were never the manuscripts on which those texts were based. I refer, here, to alternative versions of letters in the collection as it came to Barbauld. Evidence of alternative versions is not rare. For example, Edward Young's letter to Richardson dated 14 March 1754 exists in a manuscript copy and two printed texts, and both printed texts give an entire sentence that the manuscript copy does not contain. 32 The later print is not a reprint of the text in Correspondence, for it prints a long passage not given in that text (although the passage does appear in the manuscript). Barbauld seems to have seen the manuscript; although discolored today, it bears what appears to be her typical deletion stroke from top to bottom. We may infer that she had two manuscript versions to choose from, and that her deletion stroke was a directive to use the other manuscript, not this one. When, years later, Phillips re-published the same letter, he seems to have made the same choice. 33 Another example of multiple versions—and one which shows how they came to be—is Richardson's letter to Wescomb dated (but only in its Forster text) 15 September 1746. This exists in two autographs, the letter he actually sent (Huntington Library HM 6894) and a file copy (Forster FC XIV.3, ff 7-8). Collating them, one sees a progress of Richardson revision from original letter to Forster text. The text in Correspondence (3:250-255) varies from both manuscripts. Although the original letter bears some Barbauld marks and would therefore seem to be the one she used, the printed text departs from it in making deletions not marked by Richardson or Barbauld on the original but marked by Richardson on the Forster copy, and also by making deletions not marked by anyone on either copy. I suspect the existence of a third version, which would have carried forward Richardson's revisions on the Forster, introduced further cuts, and served as copy for the 1804 text. 34 Thus the question of multiple versions of letters in Richardson's collection brings us back to Richardson himself, the first person to edit his correspondence . He did to it—or at least contemplated doing to it—everything that Barbauld has ever been accused of doing. In his own words, he "altered, mutilated, disguised, or omitted" passages that might reveal the identities of the writers. 35 That he was prepared to rewrite his own letters is evidenced by his notation on one of them (FC XVI.1, f 57 r , an undated copy of a letter "To Doct. C—"), "To be better written, if not wholly omitted." That he often altered letters (those of others as well as his own) stylistically is evident from insertions and changes in his hand throughout the Forster Collection . Although we cannot be sure that he conflated letters, he certainly had no qualms about the idea of conflating them: thus he brackets in red ink a paragraph in one letter and tells himself to "Transcribe [it] to next Letter but one for y e Sentiments." 36 During 1758 he and Lady Bradshaigh collaborated on a rewrite of their correspondence, the dimensions of which can be guessed from remarks they make to each other about their work. Thus Lady Bradshaigh, evidently responding to edited texts he has sent her for review: I have taken away the 2 first letters, as useless, besides Indelicate, &amp; Ill wrote. . . . The Lines, words, or paragraphs that I wish to have restor'd, are either notch'd, or wrote in the margin, restor'd. You will find many passages dismiss'd concerning a subject, about which, we never cou'd agree. . . . I was doubtful whether I shou'd let remain what I said of my Dear &amp; worthy mother, I have alter'd severall things on that Subject. . . . Wou'd it be improper to leave what is said of a certain young friend of mine in the manner you will find it? (21 April 1758; FC XI, f 240 r ) And Richardson approves this caution even though they have no intention of actually publishing the results, for some day a third party may read their correspondence: "Were y e worst to happen, . . . we are under no Obligation to any body, or to y e Public (as second or third Persons perhaps w d think themselves) to keep to y e Letter of y e Correspondence as it passed." 36 The criteria to which Bradshaigh and Richardson appeal ("indelicate," "ill wrote," "improper") declare that Richardson's editing, like Barbauld's later, was not based on the ethic modern editors work by. He did not aim to produce historically exact texts ("y e Letter of y e Correspondence as it passed"), for such texts would include matter never meant for consumption by third parties (let alone the public at large), whether because it was private , likely to appear trivial, or likely to injure its writer's public image. 38 Richardson recognized that the value of his correspondence lay in its discussing his novels and issues raised by them. Like other eighteenth-century editors of private letters, he—and after him, Barbauld—aimed to minimize the merely local and temporary in them and thus to concentrate attention on their general interest. 39 Barbauld is working to that end when, for example , confronted with Thomas Edwards's frequent maunderings about not receiving or not sooner answering Richardson's letters, she cuts them; she sees that they lack general interest. Confronted, on the other hand, with a lengthy exchange between Richardson and his young friend Sarah Wescomb, in which Wescomb gives lame excuses for not keeping a promise to write to him and Richardson unmasks her excuses with exquisite irony, Barbauld perceives the novelistic character of the exchange and its relevance to questions of child-parent relations: she prints it. 40 Her aim was to illustrate the general tenor of the Richardson correspondence, an aim closer actually to Richardson's than to that of today's editors. Despite its faults her edition does pretty well what it meant to do. It does illustrate the general tenor of the correspondence, and at times it is as readable as—indeed, is reminiscent of—Richardson's novels. Richardson himself might well have approved of it. And now to the practical question that this study should try to answer: How much reliance can today's editors place on the texts of the 280 or so letters known only from Barbauld's edition? Because the editing of each letter is, speaking statistically, an independent event, no statistically valid prediction about Barbauld's undocumented editing of any one letter can be extrapolated from her documented editing. She can be expected to have treated different situations somewhat differently , as she evidently did with the letters of Edward Young (Appendix C). In her actual performance, however, we can certainly observe consistencies, and from them we may form impressions. The following table represents in summary the information reported in Appendices A and B (excluding the Young correspondence). Hill Edwards Wescomb Bradshaigh Other Number of MSS in Appendix A 6 43 16 11 23 Number of MSS in Appendix B 17 16 9 33 4 Number of MSS marked by ALB 22 53 24 44 13 Number marked for conflation 3 or 4 4 0 0 1 Number bearing ALB deletions 18 53 24 43 or 44 10 Range of %s of text deleted 7.6-60 4.4-61.7 7.1-56.9 1.7-67 6.5-43 Average % of text deleted 29.4 31.2 33.5 35.75 21.3 Number bearing ALB verbal changes 6 5 15 22 8 Average number of verbal changes 2.5 2 3.2 3.33 3.75 Number of printed letters with unmarked variants 6 33 15 10 10 Average number of unmarked variants 5.2 4 5.5 10.7 5 The table is arranged by correspondence because Barbauld did not treat every correspondence in exactly the same way. For example, she made, on average, slightly larger cuts in Bradshaigh-Richardson letters than in others (no doubt because some of those letters are inordinately long). Column 5, however, lumps together correspondences represented by a few manuscripts each. The numbers in Line 3 do not always agree with the totals of Lines 1 and 2 because not every manuscript text listed in Appendix A (Line 1) was actually marked by Barbauld; thus only one of the Echlin letters is counted in Line 3. I count a letter as "marked for conflation" (Line 4) if it bears a bracket or an asterisk in Barbauld's hand; if it does not, I do not count it even when I suspect the published text was conflated by her (in the case of two or three additional Edwards letters). Line 5 draws from column 4 of Appendix A and column 3 of Appendix B; the range of percentages of text deleted (line 6) is based on the ratio of the line numbers given in columns 4 (Appendix A) and 3 (Appendix B) to the line numbers given in columns 3 and 2 respectively. Line 7 states the average percentage of text deleted as the ratio of the total of columns 4 and 3 to the total of columns 3 and 2. Line 8 gives the total number of manuscripts bearing Barbauld's verbal alterations (apart from deletions); line 9 gives the average number of those alterations per manuscript, counted as numbers of words; in the Bradshaigh letters, these are often restorations of disguised names. Lines 10 and 11 derive only from Appendix A, for they attempt to summarize ways in which the published texts vary further from the marked manuscripts. The numbers in Line 11 exclude added footnotes and larger deletions of text (Edwards, 3:35-38, 41-48, 50-55, 56-58, 78-80; Bradshaigh, 4:213-217 and 6:90-96) and rephrasings and transpositions to tidy up Wescomb's grammar. Although we cannot, from these numbers, predict anything about Barbauld's treatment of any single one of the 280-odd undocumented letters, I believe the numbers do allow four conclusions about that group as a whole, the Young letters always excepted. 1. Almost all of the 280 printed letters may be presumed to abridge their originals. The abridgements may range from as little as two lines to fully two-thirds of the original text; the average abridgement, over the group, would seem to be about thirty per cent. 2. Almost all the 280 printed letters may be presumed to depart from their originals in occasional details of wording, introduced by Barbauld into the copy sent to press, by later intervention, or by both. A good number of these variants will be restorations of names disguised by Richardson, and would therefore count today as appropriate editorial emendations. 3. Of the 156 letters that Barbauld marked (the total of Line 3 in the table), only eight or nine—that is, between five and six per cent—actually bear directions to conflate. Some fourteen letters besides those of Edward Young appear to be conflations, but the conflations, I have suggested, are not inevitably Barbauld's. I would propose that if the manuscript text of a letter whose printed text is known to be conflated does not actually bear Barbauld's marks indicating intent to conflate, we should entertain the possibility that the conflation was not hers but Richardson's, in a manuscript now lost. By extrapolation, we may infer that about six per cent of the 280 letters will be Barbauld conflations. This conclusion carries a corollary. Just as we ought to admit the possibility that conflated texts in Correspondence may be Richardson's, we ought also to admit the possibility (even, I would argue, the likelihood) that when the published texts differ significantly from existing manuscript versions that bear no corresponding Barbauld marks, they were printed from other copies, presumably now lost, that represented Richardson's own revisions. Accordingly, the editors of the new edition should give thought to treating such Barbauld texts as authorial variants from their copytexts. 4. Finally, within the limits stated above, over ninety per cent of the 280 letters known only from Correspondence (minus the Young letters) can be trusted to represent with substantial accuracy the parts of their originals that they do print. From the standpoint of the modern editor they may not be first-class citizens of the Richardson canon (we would all prefer to have the manuscripts on which they are based), but they are not aliens to it. The problem that now confronts Richardsonians is not that of determining the relation of Barbauld's texts to their manuscript originals, but rather that of divining what relation those now-lost originals bore to the letters that Richardson and his correspondents actually exchanged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX A The Manuscript Counterparts of Texts in Correspondence: Summary of Collations Of the 442 letters represented in Correspondence, manuscript texts are known (as of 2002) to survive for 111. Of those, I have been able to study 99 originals and 5 more in photocopy. 41 The list below is arranged by volume and page (first column). The Forster MSS bear several different numerations; I use the one used by Eaves and Kimpel (second column). Manuscript lengths (third column) and amounts deleted ("dels," fourth column) are counted in lines; counts include headings, closings, and partial lines. Barbauld's marks on the manuscripts (fifth column) normally include writing a heading, as in Figure 1 above, so I seldom mention headings individually. The sixth column lists variants in the printed texts not indicated by Barbauld marks on the surviving manuscripts.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX C The Richardson-Edward Young Correspondence In Volume 2 of Correspondence were published 20 letters of Edward Young to Richardson and seven from Richardson to Young. Then, in 1813-19, presumably on Phillips's initiative, 149 Young-Richardson letters were published in The Monthly Magazine. When the two sets of texts are compared, it becomes apparent that 11 of the 20 Young letters in Correspondence were compiled from pieces of 28 different letters, often of widely different dates. It is not surprising that the blame for these conflations has been laid upon Barbauld, and manuscript evidence (slight though it is) shows that she had a part in them. But the evidence also suggests that Richardson, too, may have had a part. Three of the total of six manuscript letters listed in Appendices A and B bear marks by Barbauld indicating an intent to conflate. This is a far higher percentage than I have seen among the other correspondences (fifty per cent as against about six), and it implies that she treated the Young letters quite differently from others—differently, even, from the Richardson letters to Young, for none of the seven she printed are known to be conflations. 88 Why would she treat this one group of letters in a way untypical of her other editing? The reason might have arisen from the character of Young's letters. They are commonly brief, often businesslike, but also often marked by some striking epigrammatic passage (such as "I pity the Dying, &amp; envy the Dead)." 89 Abridging such letters in order to bring forward these passages would result in little more than a string of epigrams across the page; they would lose their epistolary character. Printing the letters whole, however, would retain too much that Barbauld (and Richardson) would have thought trivial; and also, because of their brevity, would result in a greater-than-average loss of page space to headings, salutations, closings, and rules between letters—a consideration that might have mattered greatly to Barbauld if she had to contend with Phillips to give her more pages. Her conflations, then, might have been an expedient for dealing with a particular problem not presented by the letters of other writers—not even by Richardson's to Young. And the possibility should not be ruled out that this expedient was suggested to her by Richardson's prior editing. I have discussed the likelihood that Young's letter of 14 March 1754 came to Barbauld in two versions, one of them presumptively Richardson's conflation (p. 203 above, and note 33). Another surviving letter, Beinecke Library Osborn MS File, Folder 17575 (Young to Richardson, autograph, 23 October 1757, a MS not known to Eaves and Kimpel), bears on its verso, in a hand that resembles the hand of a Richardson amanuensis, a passage copied from a different Young letter, 27 September 1757 (Beinecke Library, Osborn 16576 [cited above], in the hand of Young's housekeeper). Both letters went through Richardson's editorial mill, for both are headed with letter numbers and page numbers according to his system and in hands of his copyists. In this instance, ironically, Barbauld chose not to adopt the offered conflation; she printed the letter accurately as it stood. The copied passage (concerning the death of Major Hohorst) appears nowhere in Correspondence.</field>

To which are prefixed, a Biographical Account of that Author, and Observations on his Writings, 6 vols. (London: Richard Phillips, 1804); hereafter cited as Correspondence. 2 The accusation is made by Henry Pettit, ed., The Correspondence of Edward Young, 1683-1765 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. xxxiv; he based it on comparison not with MSS (for the Richardson-Young correspondence, few MSS survive) but with the texts printed in The Monthly Magazine in 1813-19. Peter Sabor has asserted categorically that "no letter printed by Barbauld should be assumed to be reliably presented" ("Publishing Richardson's Correspondence: `the necessary office of selection,' " Samuel Richardson: Tercentenary Essays, ed. Margaret Anne Doody and Peter Sabor [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989], p. 241). The apparent number of letters in Correspondence is 411. The figures of 25 composite letters and their 56 originals are mine, based on collation and the notes of Eaves and Kimpel. However, as I will remark below, very few surviving MSS show Barbauld in the act of conflating letters; most of the conflations are inferred. 3 The general editors of the edition, to be published by the Cambridge University Press, are Tom Keymer and Peter Sabor. I am grateful to them for urging me to publish the findings in this paper and for several stimulating discussions of the Forster MSS. For other assistance I am grateful to Anna Lou Ashby and John Bidwell, of the Pierpont Morgan Library. 4 Correspondence, 1:vi. See Sabor, "Publishing Richardson's Correspondence," pp. 240-241. 5 "Mrs. Barbauld . . . altered spelling and punctuation for the sake of consistency" (John Carroll, "Introduction," Selected Letters of Samuel Richardson [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964], p. 7); "Mrs. Barbauld modernized spelling and punctuation" (Eaves and Kimpel, p. 439). John August Wood, quoting a passage from Correspondence, censures Barbauld in a note for "neglect[ing] to supply the marks closing Lady Bradshaigh's quotation" ("The Chronology of the Richardson-Bradshaigh Correspondence of 1751," Studies in Bibliography, 33 [1980]: 185n). 6 "Some of the markings on the extant manuscripts must be Mrs. Barbauld's, since they indicate cuts which she made" (Eaves and Kimpel, p. 439). True, but, as we shall see, there is surer ground for identifying her marks. An assumption that any mark not Richardson's must be hers seems to underlie William Sale's claim that pages 5 and 13 of the MS of "The History of Mrs. Beaumont" (Pierpont Morgan Library MA377) bear "marks and notes by Mrs. Barbauld by way of instruction to the printer" ( Samuel Richardson: A Bibliographical Record of His Literary Career with Historical Notes [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1936], pp. 102-103). Manuscript pages 1 and 17-19 do indeed bear marks by Barbauld, but the marks on pp. 5 and 13 are not in her hand. 7 The history of the Richardson letters has been told many times. See Aleyne Lyell Reade, "Samuel Richardson and His Family Circle," Notes and Queries, 12th ser., 12 (1923): 6-7, 83-84; Carroll, "Introduction," pp. 3-11; Eaves and Kimpel, pp. 436-439; and Sabor, pp. 238-242. 8 "Seven or eight" was the number of volumes of Richardson-Lady Bradshaigh correspondence mentioned in the will of Richardson's son-in-law in 1787 (Reade, p. 6); apparently the will mentioned none of the other correspondences. The Catalogue of Manuscripts, Autograph Letters, Charters, &amp;c. sold at auction by J. W. Southgate (1828) included ten large and many small lots of Richardson letters (the letters that today occupy six volumes in the Forster Collection, plus others), and by 1828 many letters had been lost. 9 Tom Keymer, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and the Eighteenth-Century Reader (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992). 10 One of the few surviving MS Edward Young letters (Pierpont Morgan Library MA 2967, 10 April 1750) actually bears the date "1780"—and is so dated in its Monthly Magazine text (38 [1814]: 431). It is not printed in Correspondence. 11 A. N. L. Munby, The Cult of the Autograph Letter in England (London: Athlone Press, 1962), p. 68, identifies Phillips as the owner of the letters auctioned by Southgate (n. 8 above). 12 Presumably Phillips could not have taken possession of the letters before 11 February , the date probate was completed on the will of Anne Richardson, their last owner (Reade, p. 84). On 25 February Barbauld's niece Lucy Aikin wrote to a friend that "an amazing hoard" of Richardson letters "have been purchased by Phillips &amp; put into the hands of my aunt Barbauld. . . . She has only been a few days in possession of them" (MS 920 ROS 39, Liverpool Record Office, Liverpool Libraries). 13 She explains the importance of chronology in an instructional essay published after her death; see Barbauld, A Legacy for Young Ladies (London: Longman, 1826), pp. 148-156. 14 For the quotation, see n. 22 below. 15 Ordinarily her written annotations on the letters are in black or brown ink. Greenink annotations in her hand occur on FC XI, ff 151 v ("Roger"), 173 r (an inserted "was"), 185 r ("dwelt"), 273 r ("Lady E has"); XII.1, ff 9 r ("&amp;") and 33 r ("I"); and XV.2, f 12 r ("Clarissa") . To other eyes her deleting ink may appear slate-blue or even (when it has faded) grey, but it almost always contrasts clearly with the previous inks on the letters, which are brown, black, and red. 16 And except for two spelling changes: one in FC XIV.2, f 35 v , and one on the MS of Frances Sheridan to Richardson (see Appendix A below, Vol. 4, pp. 165-167). On XIV.2, f 35 v she also inserts a semi-colon—the only instance of punctuation change I have seen in any letter marked by her. 17 Likewise in a note she appended to the "Orthodoxus Anglicanus" letter (Appendix A below, Volume 2, pp. 327-333), where she uses the ampersand and dash typical of her letters and manuscript poems; again, the text in Correspondence normalizes her accidentals. 18 Young to Richardson, 7 Aug. 1751 ( Correspondence, ed. Pettit, p. 368). Or this: "Most part of what I now send I dictated to [a] female hand,—the errors of which, in spelling, the composer will easily amend" ( ibid., p. 488). "Compositors . . . have always acknowledged two duties: one is to set the words of their copy in type as exactly as possible . . .; the other is to ensure that the typographical `style' of the result—the spelling, capitalization, punctuation , italicization, and abbreviation . . . accords with the conventions of the time and place" (Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography [1974; rpt. New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 1995], p. 344). 19 Volume 1 was printed by Lewis &amp; Roden, Volumes 2 and 5 by J. Adlard, Volume 3 by Richard Taylor (a friend and protegé of Barbauld), Volume 4 by T. Gillet, and Volume 6 by W. Marchant. 20 Barbauld to the Rev. Mark Noble, 26 Oct. 1804 (Bodleian Library MS Eng. misc. d. 158, ff 87-88). Barbauld wrote to Richardson's grand-daughter, Sarah Moodie, for family information ; Moodie replied on 28 March (Reade, pp. 167, 469; Ninth Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. Part I [London, 1883], p. 487b). Moodie lived in Bath; Barbauld may have gone to see her in person, for there survives a note to Barbauld from "S." Hoare (said to be a daughter of David Hoare of Bath, but more likely Sarah, the daughter of the banker Samuel, of London) about procuring a house in Bath. On the verso of the note Barbauld scribbled a list of "Queries" regarding Richardson's correspondents; for example , "Who was Miss Ferrer &amp; is her ode to Cynthia printed" and "Who was Miss Westcombe afterwards Scudamore" (The Fales MS Collection, Box 5, Folder 10; Fales Library, New York University). These queries are reminders that the public record on Richardson was a lot thinner then than now. Another list of Barbauld queries concerns Sarah Fielding and Jane Collier (Beinecke Library, Osborn Files, Folder 724). Barbauld also asked Phillips to send her books: the Biographia Britannica and John Nichols's Biographical and Literary Anecdotes of William Bowyer (Barbauld to Phillips, 20 Apr. 1804 [see n. 22]; Phillips to Nichols, 24 Apr. [1804; MS Eng. lett. c. 362, f 36, Bodleian Library]). This research is very similar to Samuel Johnson's for his Lives of the Poets; see William McCarthy, "The Composition of Johnson's Lives: A Calendar," Philological Quarterly, 60 (1981): 53-67. 21 He thus describes himself to the poet William Hayley: "I enter with Zeal into all my conc[erns] &amp; like to superintend the progress [of] my Publications" (William Hayley MSS, xxx.15, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University; quoted by permission of the Syndics of the Fitzwilliam Museum to whom rights in this publication are assigned). My characterization of Phillips is gathered from a reading of all 21 of his letters to Hayley, 1804-10; they must be seen to be believed. Phillips was notorious for coarseness and stinginess: "Edmund Curll the Second," William Taylor called him (J. W. Robberds, A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich [London: Murray, 1843], 1:379). 22 Barbauld to Phillips, 20 Apr. 1804 (MS, Dyce Letters 26.E.3, f. 9, Victoria and Albert Museum; emphasis hers). The letter begins, "I should think myself much to blame if I were unmindful of your interest in this business, but in truth I have only waited. . . ." The copy for beginning Vol. 4 consists, she says, of " Delany Dewes &amp; Donnellan "; in total, that would account for the first 119 pages of the volume. 23 Eaves and Kimpel say July (p. 438), but they seem to have misread the notice in The Monthly Magazine (17 [1 July 1804]: 600) on which they depend: there Correspondence is reported to have been published in May. May 26 is the date given in the publication notice to the frontispiece portrait in Vol. 1. On the other hand, The Monthly Magazine announced on 1 June (17:466) that Correspondence "is to be published in a few days." On 25 April— five days after her response to Phillips's reproaches—Barbauld predicted that she had at least two weeks' more work to do (Barbauld, ALS to "Madam" misdated 1806, ThompsonClarkson MSS 1:13(i), Friends House Library, London). Another letter of this period (exact date unknown) testifies to the stress she felt: " I am very busy; being, as I believe you know, deeply engaged in the job I have perhaps rashly undertaken" (E. C. Rickards, "Mrs. Barbauld and her Pupil," Murray's Magazine, 10 [1891]: 712). 24 That seems to be the case today for about 280 letters printed in 1804, but they did not all go missing in printing houses; the 1828 auction catalogue lists a number of MS letters known today only from Correspondence. The Young-Richardson letters, however, had been largely destroyed or lost by 1828, most likely during 1813-19, while being published in The Monthly Magazine. 25 Just how little editorial control Barbauld may really have had is perhaps suggested by one of the unprinted letters (FC XIII.2, f 31), which she annotated with the direction, "NB This letter may come after all Aaron Hill's &amp; immediately before Gilbert Hill's. " Neither the letter thus annotated nor letters by Gilbert Hill appear in Correspondence. Was she proposing, and Phillips disposing? An anomaly of the edition may be explained by some such disagreement—in this case, a disagreement which Barbauld would have won. A group of Richardson-Lady Bradshaigh letters (by far the largest of Richardson's correspondences, and arguably the most important) closes Volume 4; Volume 5 then prints other correspondences, closing with a couple of poems and a fragment of fiction, "The History of Mrs. Beaumont." Although the edition was expected to fill "five or six" volumes ( Monthly Magazine, 17 [1 March 1804]: 159), the actual sixth volume, consisting entirely of more Richardson-Bradshaigh letters, looks very much like an afterthought. Did Barbauld, appreciating the importance of those letters, demand that Phillips give her that sixth volume? Or were its letters the "new matter" that Phillips sprung on her sometime after February? The texts printed in Volume 6 are among the confused texts in the edition, with misdatings and some conflations; if 6 was an afterthought, Barbauld might have had to prepare copy for it in a rush. 26 The letter is Thomas Edwards to Richardson, 28 Feb. 1752 (FC XII.1, ff 43-44; Correspondence , 3:35-38). The only mark on the letter that is probably Barbauld's is an asterisk next to line 17 on f 43 r . 27 They could also have been made post-hoc, by the press corrector, to check the continuity of the printed sheets; but I interpret them as either predictive or simultaneous with composition for two reasons: they are in different hands, and one of them is inaccurate (FC XIV.3, f 46 v , "N 265" at the place where in its volume p. 261 begins), which it would not be if it recorded a gathering already printed off. See Percy Simpson, Proofreading in the Sixteenth , Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Centuries (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1935), p. 50, and Gaskell, New Introduction to Bibliography, pp. 40-43. See also n. 43 below. 28 "I want them to refer to," she says (see n. 22). 29 In Volume 3, pages 1-96 comprise gatherings B-E. 30 The conflated letters are 3:126-130, in which Barbauld has transferred to a letter dated (in Correspondence ) 28 July 1755 a paragraph from a letter dated (in FC XII.1, f 143 r ) 18 June 1755; and 3:135-137, dated 12 July 1756 in Correspondence but of which the first paragraph is transferred from a letter dated 25 May 1756 in FC XII.1, f 171 r . See Appendix A, below, for details of her markings on these letters. 31 "It does not appear . . . that copy was normally returned to the author with the proof until the later nineteenth century" (Gaskell, p. 352). Quite possibly Phillips himself, or an agent, also intervened in the transcripts. Phillips owned the letters, and in later years he published others of them in magazines. With the magazine texts Barbauld had nothing to do; presumably they were the work of Phillips and the agent(s) he then employed. Thus, in 1808-09 there appeared in the European Magazine 28 letters between Richardson and Sarah Wescomb, twelve of which can be collated against Forster manuscripts. Three of those twelve—FC XIV.3, f 104 ( European Magazine, 54 [1808]: 94-95); FC XIV.2, ff 55-56 ( EM, 55 [1809]: 101-102); and FC XIV.2, f 8 ( EM, 54 [1808]: 97, dated 2 Oct. 1754)—are letters whose manuscript originals Barbauld had marked up, and the third was actually printed in Correspondence (3:322-323, there dated 22 Oct.). The magazine texts of those letters differ from the Barbauld-marked manuscripts in the same kinds of ways (except that they ignore most of Barbauld's deletions) as the 1804 texts differ from their Barbauld-marked originals. Was Phillips—or his agent—responsible for these differences on both occasions? 32 The MS (a copy by one of Richardson's copyists) is Pierpont Morgan Library MS 1024(6); the printed texts are Correspondence, 2:32-33 (abridged), and Monthly Magazine, 41 (1816): 230-231. Eaves and Kimpel also discuss this letter (pp. 183-184n). 33 To be sure, both printed texts could be conflated, Monthly Magazine printing the whole of the Morgan manuscript which Barbauld abridged and then following Barbauld in adding to it the other sentence. This theory would of course call in question the accuracy of the Monthly Magazine texts of the Young-Richardson letters, which hitherto have served as the standard for condemning Barbauld's; and it would not explain why Barbauld deleted the entire Morgan letter. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the intrusive sentence occurs also in Young's letter dated 12 Dec. 1749 in Monthly Magazine 38 (1816): 430, not printed by Barbauld. Even if she could be shown to have lifted the sentence from the 1749 letter and inserted it into 1754, that would still not account for Phillips's including it in both letter texts. The Morgan MS, it must be remembered, is not Young's original letter; conceivably, the MS itself is an abridged or even conflated text. 34 The relation of printed text to MSS is somewhat muddied in this case by the fact that printed text sometimes agrees with HM in not observing FC's deletions and verbal changes. Barbauld certainly did not use FC; had she done so, she would presumably have printed the date of the letter. Neither, however, could HM have served as copy for the final printed text, for few of the deletions and none of the verbal changes in Correspondence are marked on it. A third argument for multiple versions is the letter of Erasmus Reich to Richardson, dated 10 May 1754 in Correspondence, 5:297-298. Its MS counterpart today, FC XV.3, f 66, is unsigned and undated, and is headed (by Richardson) only "From Mr. . . . . [ sic ] Bookseller at Leipsick"; Richardson's index to the correspondence (XV.3, f 1) also leaves the name blank. Finally, the 1804 text represents an entire rewrite of Reich's weak English. Since there would have been no way for Barbauld to guess from this surviving MS or Richardson's index who wrote this letter or when, she must have used a different MS; and the most reasonable inference is that she used a version rewritten, signed and dated by Richardson himself. A notation by Richardson on FC XI, f 228 v , "See in M. Reich's Letters, dated 7 7 bre , 1757," shows that Richardson had compiled a file of Reich's letters. For other indications of multiple versions, see notes 44, 45, 74, 78, and 79 below. 35 Richardson to Mrs. Scudamore, 1 Sept. 1758 (FC XIV.2 f 6 r ), referring to his own letters; Richardson assures Scudamore that her letters have been "scratched . . . thro' . . . as letters never to appear." Carroll, quoting this passage ("Introduction," p. 6), asserts that Richardson's editing was not really "as thorough as he suggested in this letter." That judgment can be based only on the MSS known today, and even then it is debatable, as we are about to see. It should be noted that early observers of the MSS perceived that Richardson had worked them over: he "arranged and corrected great part for the press," states the Monthly Magazine announcement cited in n. 25. 36 Notation on Aaron Hill to Richardson, 21 July 1736 (FC XIII.2, f 10 v ). Besides signifying removal of the marked text to another letter, Richardson's "transcribe" may also have meant "rewrite"; for when he urges Lady Echlin to send him her "Remarks" on Clarissa he asks her "not to have [them] transcribed. I ever admired the first flowings of a fine Imagination " (FC XI, f 126 r ). But his admiration of "first flowings" did not prevent his revising both his own and those of others. For another instance of possible conflation by Richardson (this one wrongly blamed on Barbauld), see below, note 80. And for indications that transcription did imply revision for one of Richardson's correspondents, see note 50 below. 37 FC XI, f 227 v (2 Jan. 1758). I am grateful to Peter Sabor for bringing this and the previous passage to my attention. Some of the Richardson-Bradshaigh letters now in FC XI are evidently relics of their joint editing (a particularly messy example is FC XI, ff 19-20); others are copies by Richardson's amanuenses; still others are original letters, especially from her to him. Barbauld deserves praise for managing to make as much sense as she did of them. 38 Good examples of Richardson's concern for his image are provided by his notes to himself to omit or tone down passages that praise him too highly. (See Figure I for an instance.) Were he to let them stand, he would be perceived as grossly egotistical. An additional reason in support of the argument that the Young letter of 14 March 1754 once existed in another copy besides the one we now have is that the passage not printed in its Correspondence text contains fulsome praise, just the sort of thing Richardson would have told himself to omit (see p. 9 above). Barbauld, for her part. took care to avoid the " impropriety " of publishing letters "of any living character" ( Correspondence, 1:v), and she disguised the names of living people. 39 I argued this position—that eighteenth-century editors of private letters worked to a standard of "general interest," not historical particularity—some years ago in Hester Thrale Piozzi: Portrait of a Literary Woman (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1985), pp. 135-138. Of course, "general interest" could be satisfied by epistolary representations of friendly behavior, and thus much local detail could be preserved—as it is by both Richardson and Barbauld in their editings of the correspondence. 40 For Barbauld's cuts of Edwards on not receiving or sooner answering Richardson's letters, see FC XII.1, ff 12, 37, 74, 88, 108, 121, 141, and 163. The Richardson-Wescomb exchange is Correspondence, 3:281-305. 41 For photocopies of the five letters whose originals I have not seen and of additional MSS of three others, and for descriptions of ink colors on some of them, I am grateful to the Bodleian Library (and Dr. Colin Harris); the Brotherton Library, University of Leeds; the Folger Shakespeare Library (and Heather Wolfe, MSS Curator); the Haverford College Library (and Diana Peterson, Archivist); the Hyde Collection (and Marcia Levinson, Curator); the Huntington Library (and Gayle M. Barkley, MSS Assistant); and the National Library of Scotland (and Dr. Iain G. Brown, Principal Curator, MSS). 42 Throughout the Hill letters, Hill's MS " `em" is changed to "them" in the printed texts. The change seems to follow Richardson's own precedent: on FC XIII.3, f 18 r , he changes an " `em" to "them." 43 The MS (Hill's autograph) bears a gathering notation, "Vol. I. C 25," but the printed letter occupies pp. 87-88. In Volume I, gathering C does begin on p. 25. This letter might have been initially destined for pp. 25-26 and removed to its present, chronologically more accurate, position during production. Were Hill letters part of the "new matter" sent by Phillips that required Barbauld to alter her selection, thus changing the placement of this one? 44 Gathering F in Vol. I begins on p. 97, but the MS bears no gathering notation. The MS is blotted, and it bears Richardson's deletion stroke throughout; did Correspondence print from a different Richardson copy? 45 The original letter that went through the post. The entire absence of Barbauld marks on the MS and the change of the place-name from "Hungerford-Parley" in MS to "the Devizes" in Correspondence make it nearly certain that Correspondence prints from a different Richardson copy. 46 The verso of this letter bears a transcription of a passage from another letter (Young to Richardson, 27 Sept. 1757, Beinecke Library Osborn MSS Box Y, Folder 16576), as if copied for insertion into this one. The passage does not appear in Correspondence, nor have I found it in the Monthly Magazine texts. The hand of the transcription resembles that of a leading Richardson amanuensis (the hand, e.g., of FC XI, ff 259-260), but I am not sure of the identification; perhaps the transcript was made in 1780. 47 The MS (dated 9 April 1751) has been trimmed for mounting; perhaps the margin bore Barbauld's direction to conflate. 48 Dated 27 May 1750 in Correspondence; MS date (partly torn off) is "May 2[ ] 175[ ]; dated by Eaves and Kimpel [29?] May 1753. No marks by Barbauld. 49 MS bears no Barbauld mark except heading. The Highmore letters came to Barbauld (or Phillips) from Highmore herself ( Correspondence, 1:v), hence presumably would not have undergone editing by Richardson. Barbauld probably had this and the next letter copied and did her editing on the copies. Did she treat the third letter differently because Phillips was nagging her? 50 Edwards's side of this correspondence is also represented by Bodleian Library MSS 1011-12, his letterbook copies. They often differ substantively from the FC texts, the letters he actually sent to Richardson. Apparently Edwards revised his letters when he transcribed them. 51 Gathering B in Vol. 3 begins on p. 1, but the MS bears no gathering notation. Nor any marks by Barbauld. 52 Gathering C begins on p. 25, but the MS bears no gathering notation. 53 FC is incomplete; missing text supplied by Bodleian MS 1012, pp. 1 ff (the Edwards copybook text, which Barbauld did not see). MS length refers to FC. 54 Gathering D begins on p. 49, but the MS bears no gathering notation. 55 Gathering E begins on p. 73, but the MS bears no gathering notation. 56 The letter containing the poem (SR to Edwards, 28 July 1754) is marked only once by Barbauld and omitted from Correspondence. 57 Fol. 116 r bears gathering notation, "Vol. 3 F 97" (see Figure 3 and discussion). 58 Fol. 137 r bears gathering notation, "Vol 3 G 121." 59 Fol. 171 is SR to Edwards, 25 May 1756 (copy), reduced by cutting to 16 lines. (Fol. 170 is another fragment of the same letter.) In Correspondence, f 171 r is printed as the opening of SR to Edwards, 12 July 1756. 60 Including the first 8 lines, which are replaced in Correspondence (letter of 12 July 1756) by the text of f 171 r . No Barbauld asterisk indicating these changes appears on either 171 or 172. 61 In this correspondence, Barbauld follows Richardson's lead in tidying up Wescomb's poor grammar. But tonal effects created by Richardson's underlinings of words in MS are lost in Correspondence, which does not print his underlinings. Barbauld and Correspondence also consistently misspell Wescomb's name. 62 Fol. 4 r bears gathering notation, "Vol. 3.M 241." 63 Two MSS exist, HM (SR's original letter, actually posted) and FC XIV.3, ff 7-8 (his file copy). HM is lightly and FC heavily edited by him; the direction of editing is from HM to FC. Although Barbauld marked HM and not FC, the Correspondence text differs enough from both to prompt speculation that it was printed from a third SR copy. 64 Fol. 46 v bears gathering notation, "N 265," at the place where p. 261 in Correspondence begins. The copy was thus four pages shorter at this point than anticipated. 65 Fol. 48 r bears gathering notation, "Vol. III. n 265." 66 Of which Richardson had previously deleted 21; his name changes are ignored. 67 "I," a word often omitted by Wescomb and supplied by Richardson himself in her letters. 68 Fol. 59 r bears gathering notation, "Vol III O 289." 69 There is a gap of one leaf or more between f 66 and f 67. 70 FC is a scribal copy. Richardson's autograph (Haverford College Library, Roberts Autographs 145) bears Barbauld's heading, "R to M rs S.," but is not otherwise marked by her. 71 Fol. 156 r bears gathering notation, "Vol IV K 193." 72 Barbauld's changes include replacing Richardson's "my divine girl" with "Clarissa." 73 Fol. 2 v bears gathering notation, "Vol.IV. L 217," at a place which in Correspondence occurs on p. 216. A similar notation on f 2 r , "214 Vol 4," does not designate or correspond to a gathering, and seems to be a post-hoc notation by a later hand. 74 A variant text of pp. 226-228 is given in Barbauld's "Life" of Richardson, 1:xlviii-l: evidence that this letter also existed in different versions? 75 Each of Barbauld's major dels (ff 6 v -7 r , 7 v -8 r , and 10-12) surrounds a gap of one leaf or more in the text as we now have it. Did she make them in response to gaps already there? 76 Fol. 14 r bears gathering notation, "Vol IV M 241." The place of f 11 in this letter is unclear; it may belong to a different letter. 77 Fol. 126 r bears gathering notation, "Vol V B 25" at the point where, in Correspondence , gathering C begins. FC is incomplete; Richardson's autograph file copy (Hyde Collection) agrees with Correspondence 5:21-24 (apart from the latter's deletion of 21 lines) in all but two words. Probably FC was copied from Hyde. 78 MS is Richardson's original letter. The total absence of editorial marks, here and on the following Echlin letters, suggests that Barbauld used different versions. 79 MS is heavily edited by Richardson and Lady Bradshaigh; there is a gap of 3 leaves between ff 19 and 20. Fols. 19 r (lines 24-32) and 19 v do not correspond to the text in Correspondence , pp. 42-47; part of that text may print from the missing leaves, but it also appears to conflate this letter with another (now lost). Although the MS is marked by Barbauld it was not necessarily copy for the conflated text, for f 19 shows no mark cuing in the other text. Did Barbauld use another version, already conflated by Richardson and Bradshaigh ? A marginal note in Bradshaigh's hand reads, "This introduced a gash by restoring a former" at the point where f 19 and Correspondence part company, and on f 20 Bradshaigh's marginal text is marked by an X for insertion into the main text. 80 Wood, "Chronology of the Richardson-Bradshaigh Correspondence," asserts that because the Correspondence text of this letter (dated 29 March 1751) includes text from 8 April 1751 it must be "another of Mrs. Barbauld's composites" (p. 189). But FC XI, ff 2223 , in Richardson's hand, clearly bears both dates; if the text is a composite it is his, not Barbauld's. Wood's confusion may have stemmed from an error by Eaves and Kimpel, who describe FC XI, ff 22-23 as the end of the letter begun 29 March 1751 when it is in fact the beginning. Perhaps Wood did not see the MS. 81 Gathering N begins on p. 265, but the MS bears no gathering notation. The end of the letter is missing. 82 Red-ink insertions by Richardson are printed in Correspondence, but his deletions are ignored. 83 This letter bears many marks by Richardson, including his red-ink bracket around a paragraph and a note, "Transcribe to next Letter but one for y e Sentiments." 84 Fol. 22 is the beginning of Aaron Hill to Richardson, dated (in another hand) 12 April 1739; it does not correspond to the letter of the same date in Correspondence, 1:2223 .

      <field name="fulltext">The forms of eighteenth-century editions of English literary texts were at least as diverse as the forms taken by literary editions in our own time, varying as they did not only with the different markets at which particular editions were aimed, but also with the naturally more fluid state of a scholarly genre in a relatively early phase of its historical development. Small-format editions for instance, aimed at general use, or theatre texts meant to be pocketed by a playhouse audience, included minimal scholarly paratexts. Early editions of Shakespeare, prepared by poets—Nicholas Rowe (1709) and Alexander Pope (1723-25)—for a general and genteel readership similarly provided sparse textual and explanatory matter. As vernacular literary editing became more and more a domain of historical scholarship, or `philology', the poetic text was increasingly accompanied by a far more elaborated apparatus , as in Zachary Grey's edition of Hudibras (1744), Thomas Newton's variorum Paradise Lost (1749), or Thomas Tyrwhitt's Chaucer (1775). The disposition and relations of that apparatus, as now, were variable. In Tyrwhitt's Chaucer, or in John Upton's 1758 Spenser, elaborated scholarly annotation was printed separately from the `clean' text. In Grey's Hudibras or Newton's Milton the text was accompanied by substantial bodies of footnotes. In Richard Bentley's 1732 edition of Paradise Lost the text page becomes a complex and interrelating pattern of various components, the text attended by substantial and typographically insistent footnotes and a battery of marginal alternative readings, and itself broken up by italics and square brackets— `hooks'—drawing attention to what Bentley thought dubious readings. In the editing of the plays of William Shakespeare, however, an essentially `standard' format for the scholarly edition was adopted and evolved over the course of the century. Lewis Theobald, arguably the first `critical'— to use his own word, `intelligent'—editor of Shakespeare, also led the way in providing a formal model, deliberately choosing (as he told his then friend William Warburton) `to follow the form of Bentley's Amsterdam Horace, in subjoining the notes to the place controverted.' 1 Theobald's example of providing the text with a running accompaniment of explanatory and textual footnotes was followed, with a generally rising ratio of notes to text, and more or less steadily increasing scholarly paratexts, in the editions of Pope and Warburton (1747), Samuel Johnson (1765), Johnson and Steevens (1773 and 1778), Reed (1785), Malone (1790), and Steevens (1793). In this paper I shall be discussing the highly individual editorial work of Edward Capell, which formally is strikingly distinct from this recognizable main stream. Capell is now best remembered for his edition of Shakespeare, ten octavo volumes of the text of the plays, published in 1768, followed by a First Part of Notes and Various Readings in 1774, and the complete threevolume Notes and Various Readings of 1779 through 1783. I shall refer also to Capell's only other piece of published editing, the Prolusions . . . of Antient Poetry (1760); to Capell's holograph copy for the Shakespeare edition; and to Capell's unpublished holograph Milton, which survives with the Shakespeare holograph in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. Both the text and the subsequent apparatus of Capell's Shakespeare edition are innovative and distinctive. As we shall see, the Shakespearean text was published, in 1768, in a strikingly, even provocatively, `clean' form. Capell's textual practice, abandoning the textus receptus and returning to the `original copies', displayed what is arguably a radical text-critical modernity . Capell's explanatory notes, published many years after the text, and very different in book form and mise en page, are based on a daunting range and depth of contextualizing knowledge of Elizabethan and Jacobean culture and literature rivalled, amongst previous editors of Shakespeare, only by Theobald and Johnson. Capell's hermeneutic procedures and text-editorial methodologies have been both discussed and appreciated by such scholars as Alice Walker and Brian Vickers. 2 Here I shall examine rather the `bibliographical codes' of Capell's works of English editorial scholarship: matters of volume format and makeup, the relations among texts and paratexts, styling and mise en page. In particular I shall argue that Capell's editorial publications are deliberately designed and carefully produced, reflecting not only the expertise and craftsmanship of their printer, but also the intentions of Capell himself. Both the Shakespeare and the Prolusions display Capell's thorough and thoughtful attention to form and to the effect of form on function. Both books show the clearest evidence of Capell's highly distinctive view of the editor's role, of typographic layout, of the reader's use of the text, and of the relation of the editor both to his author and to his reader.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In 1760 Capell published his Prolusions. Perhaps no other English literary edition of the eighteenth century—certainly none before George Steevens's Twenty of the Plays of Shakespeare (1766)—is so determinedly a manifesto of editorial purpose. The full title of the work (plate 1) makes explicit Capell's claimed design: Prolusions; or, select Pieces of antient Poetry,— compil'd with great Care from their several Originals, and offer'd to the Publick as Specimens of the Integrity that should be found in the Editions of worthy Authors. The Virgilian epigraph reinforces the point: impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit? barbarus has segetes? Eclogues 1.70-71. Here Meliboeus fears that his cherished lands are in danger of passing to a godless soldiery; by analogy, Capell invites us to think of English literature as (in Dryden's translating phrase) `happy fields', which must be preserved from the hands of the barbarous, and cultivated with care and honesty. 3 The book is made up of editions of The Nutbrown Maid; Thomas Sackville's Induction ; Sir Thomas Overbury's A Wife, now a Widowe; the pseudo-Shakespearean Edward the Third; and Sir John Davies's Nosce Teipsum. The Dedication reiterates Capell's intention to offer `an Example of Care and Fidelity to Persons who take upon them the Publication of our best Authors'. That `Care and Fidelity' is certainly instanced in Capell's text-editorial procedure as he explains it in his Preface: the selection, on the basis of collation , of one original authoritative text as base text or `ground-work'; its emendation either by collation with other copies or by rational conjecture; and the faithful reporting of all variant readings. 4 But the care and fidelity appropriate to the reprinting of the texts of the English literary tradition is instanced too in the make-up, format, and printing of the Prolusions. The volume was printed ` for J. and R. Tonson in the Strand ', by Dryden Leach, `who may be styled', as John Nichols was to put it in his Literary Anecdotes (2.453), `the Father of Fine Printing in this Country'; the colophon reads, with a proper pride and unusual specificity, ` From the Press of Dryden Leach, in Crane-court, Fleetstreet. Oct. 6 th . 1759'. The book is a small, carefully-printed octavo. The page measures 6.875 x 4.5 inches (175 x 114 mm.). 5 The type is a distinctive small Caslon, light-faced and beautifully cut, cleanly inked and impressed on a wove paper (to the significance of which I shall return). The text page is neat and elegant, with relatively generous margins, particularly at the foot, and minimum decoration; the opening page of Edward III (plate 2) bears a rectangular rule frame at the head, and a plain rule under the title, but other pages have no rules or type ornaments at all. Most pages have a single line of textual notes; Capell was keen to preserve what he calls `the beauty of his page' by printing the remainder of the textual variants in separated lists rather than as footnotes. There are no explanatory notes on the page, and no line numbers. There is no catch-word. There are some curiously old-fashioned features of style, including the small black-letter used for some of the textual footnotes, but overall this is a strikingly `modern' piece of printing. The 1768 Shakespeare is similar in format and style. It is made up of ten small octavo volumes whose pages measure 7 x 4.5 inches (178 x 114 mm.). 6 The most immediately striking feature of the title page (plate 3) of the printed work is the title itself: `Mr WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE / his / COMEDIES, HISTORIES, and TRAGEDIES. ' Other eighteenth-century editions of Shakespeare named themselves in a familiar and standardised way: `The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare' (Rowe), `The Works of Shakespear ' (Pope, Hanmer, Warburton), `The Works of Shakespeare' (Theobald), `The Plays of William Shakespeare' (Johnson), `The Plays of William Shakspeare ' (Johnson and Steevens, Reed), `The Plays and Poems of William Shakspeare' (Malone). (The most consequential disagreement in these forms of title, notoriously, is in the spelling of Shakespeare's name.) Capell's form of title is highly unusual in its own time, but it is of course a version of the title of the first folio: ` Mr. WILLIAM / SHAKESPEARES / COMEDIES, / HISTORIES, &amp; / TRAGEDIES.' To revert to the 1623 folio title is at once to make a claim of genuineness and originality, to assert the authenticity of the text presented in these volumes. Unlike the conventional eighteenthcentury title—`The Works of Shakespeare'—Capell's chosen title gives the author primacy, putting Shakespeare's name at the head of the page. Indeed, Capell's form of words, `Mr WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE / his / COMEDIES, . . .', uses an older form of the possessive than Heminge and Condell had done a century and a half before, allowing Capell to present Shakespeare's name untrammelled by inflection. The name of Capell as editor appears nowhere on the title page, an act of self-effacement which aligns him with such another gentleman-editor as Charles Jennens. These are strategies which give Shakespeare an uncontested authority. In other eighteenth-century editions the word `Works' or `Plays' is almost always given the largest type, and the name of the editor or editors almost always appears, with lesser or greater prominence. One might contrast with Capell's, for instance, the title pages of Johnson's 1765 Shakespeare (plate 4), or the 1778 Johnson and Steevens Shakespeare. In both of these the most prominence is given to the word PLAYS, set on its own line in capitals 6 mm high. In both these title pages, Shakespeare's name is allowed rather smaller capitals, 3.5 mm high. In Johnson's 1765 Shakespeare the editor's name appears but is permitted only decently small capitals, a little over 2 mm high. In 1778, less modestly, and more closely approaching the typographical status allowed to Shakespeare himself, the names of Johnson and Steevens are printed in capitals 3 mm high. Capell's title page is not on the face of it less cluttered than those of other Shakespearean editions. Following the title itself, Capell provides a description of his book, which insists once more on its textual authenticity—`faithfully republish'd' from the original quartos and folios—and sets out what the reader may expect to find, including the Notes and Various Readings, promised for `some other Volumes'. (Such a description was of course necessary in Capell's time, when the title page doubled as a blurb, set up as advertisement in the bookseller's shop or in the street.) There is, as so often in the eighteenth-century vernacular literary edition, a classical motto, asserting in rather familiar fashion the superhuman genius of Shakespeare (`Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit' [`Who surpassed the race of man in understanding'] , Lucretius, De rerum natura, 3. 1056). And there is a simple imprint. Nevertheless, this is an unpretentious and well-proportioned page. There are neither rules nor (unlike the pompous page of Sir Thomas Hanmer's Oxford Shakespeare) ornaments. If Capell's does not have the simplicity of early Foulis title pages—the 1743-45 edition of Shaftesbury's Characteristicks, for instance, or the 1756 Horace Opera —or the monumental severity of Baskerville's 1757 Virgil Opera, it nonetheless appears strikingly light and well-balanced. The balance is aided by the clear separation and spacing of the elements of the title—author's name, the different genres of the works, the account of the editorial enterprise in this volume and in the promised Notes and Various Readings, the motto, the imprint. The lightness is substantially effected by the very extensive use of italics, in contrast with the predominant roman upper case of Johnson's 1765 edition, or the 1778 Johnson / Steevens edition, or, more starkly, with the lapidary mass and precision of Baskerville's large rounded roman capitals. The effect achieved in this title page—within the space and conventions available clean, elegant, classicising—is substantially as intended by Edward Capell as editor of these volumes, as we can see from comparing it with the title page as it appears in Capell's holograph manuscript, now in the Wren Library at Trinity College (plate 5). Dryden Leach as printer of course must have had a substantial input, in terms of choice of fount and other matters, and Capell and Leach presumably had opportunities to consult before and after their previous work together on the Prolusions. Nevertheless, the typography and layout of the printed page, its line-breaks, punctuation, spacing , capitalisation, and italicisation, are exactly as set out in the fair copy provided by Capell. The only detail that differs is the imprint, where the absence of the name of printer or publisher—the manuscript supplies a mere `&amp;c.'—might suggest that Capell had deliberately designed the page before he knew for certain who his printer and publisher would be. At least as probably, however, those choices were already made, and Capell was simply leaving Leach and Tonson free to specify their preferred exact wording. So close a match between the author's manuscript and the printed title page is remarkable. It was not of course unusual for authors to set out their own title pages, as James McLaverty has demonstrated in his seminal article on the subject, `Questions of Entitlement'. 7 After 1728, according to McLaverty , Alexander Pope probably designed his own title pages. He was capable of calligraphic imitation of type-headings, as in the manuscript of An Essay on Criticism. 8 McLaverty shows, however, using the theoretical example of a comment by Moxon in Mechanick Exercises, and the practical instance of William Wake's Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of England , that while it was common for authors to draft carefully-designed title pages, it was normal for compositors to make alterations so as to `order [the author's] Work the better'. Capell seems to have needed, or tolerated, no such ordering at all. Capell's prescription of the codicography and typography of his book, however, goes far beyond the title page. The text-page of the printed Shakespeare is distinctive, and in many respects similar in styling to that of the Prolusions (plate 6). Again, the format is a small octavo. There are particularly generous margins, almost an inch at the top and right, and almost an inch at the foot; the page has the proportions, and aspires to the elegance, of a larger format work. The typeface is a small Caslon, slightly more heavily cut than that used in the Prolusions (there is, incidentally, a Leach/Caslon connection; Dryden Leach printed, in 1764, A specimen of printing types by W. Caslon and Son ). There are no catch-words, no line numbers, and no ornaments apart from straight rules, and the plain rectangular rule frame used in the headings of poems in the Prolusions recurs, as on this first page of Hamlet. As in the Prolusions there is a single line of textual notes at the foot of the page (plate 7), but no explanatory notes on the page, and as in the Prolusions this is announced as deliberate policy. In the Introduction to the 1768 Shakespeare Capell excuses himself, with a politely contemptuous irony, for not including the `accustom'd and laudable garniture of Notes, Glossaries , ' etc. He explains this decision partly on the grounds of the difficulty of distributing notes amongst the volumes; partly on the grounds of his intention to provide notes quite separately; and partly, and significantly, because `a very great part of the world, amongst whom is the editor himself, profess much dislike to this paginary intermixture of text and comment' (p. 30). There is striking further evidence of the extent to which Capell's textpage , like the title page, embodies his intentions. Most editors at this time gave their printers a more-or-less heavily marked up and interlineated copy of a previous text (Theobald, for instance, sent to the printer a heavilymarked copy of the 1728 second edition of Pope's Shakespeare ). 9 Capell however provided a remarkably neat holograph fair copy, embodying his own rather than a traditionary text, with virtually every detail of layout and typography made explicit, and hardly a correction in sight (plate 8). Comparing the published text with Capell's surviving manuscript demonstrates that Dryden Leach followed his lead closely in matters of layout, rules, spacing , capitalisation, and italicisation. There are three differences between Capell's manuscript and the printed book. Two are slight: the abbreviated names of characters, marked for caps and small caps in the manuscript, are italicised in the printed book, and the catch-words of Capell's manuscript disappear in print. The third change is more substantial and significant, purifying the page and certainly made according to Capell's intention. Capell's holograph transcript includes marginal initials identifying the provenance of readings derived from other moderns: `R.' for Rowe, `P.' for Pope, `T.' for Theobald, and so on. They are dropped in the printed text, he explains in his Introduction, because they are `unsightly', as well as because `his only object has been to do service to his great Author' (1.24n.). This is a privileging of text over gloss, the restored scripture of the author over the intrusions of the editor's secondary responsibility. 10 The correspondence between Capell's transcript and the printed book is otherwise extremely exact. Remarkably, it extends as far as the number of lines per page, and page divisions, which, in printed text and manuscript coincide exactly up to page 32. In both the text occupies 136 pages. Capell's manuscript is written on a very good quality paper with the line divisions pricked out exactly in the right hand margin, ready for use. Each page of the manuscript, and of the book, affords 32 lines to the poetic text. Interestingly enough the manuscript of Capell's neverpublished edition of Paradise Lost also has 32 lines per page. 11 Two further characteristics of the Capellian page style contribute to the production of a clean and uncluttered, a classically simple, textual effect. Firstly, capitalisation is light; Capell's manuscripts and published work are in the vanguard of the process by which capitalisation was purged from the literary text. In the manuscript and printed texts of Capell's Shakespeare only proper names, and the first word of each line of poetry, have initial capitals. In the Trinity College manuscript of Capell's edition of Paradise Lost there is no initial capital for the first word of each line, except for the first word of each verse paragraph. The same policy is followed in all of the texts (except Edward III ) printed in Capell's Prolusions (plate 9); it seems reasonable to assume that this was a feature of the manuscript for the Prolusions (which is not known to be extant). Capell's use of italicisation is more problematic. Decades before Capell's Prolusions or Shakespeare, such authors as Alexander Pope (David Foxon has argued) 12 were already dropping the use of italics for proper names, partly in the search for a more classical textual simplicity, partly because they felt such typographic emphases assumed an unsophisticated audience. Capell's texts, however, both printed and manuscript, regularly italicise names. In an equally old-fashioned manner, Capell uses italics, not quotation marks, to identify quotation and direct speech. In the manuscript of Paradise Lost direct speech is always italicised; the lengthy speeches of Raphael, for instance, appear on the page as solid blocks of italic. The same styling is used in the Prolusions, notably in The notbrowne Mayde (plate 10). This may be an old-fashioned usage, but the effect is purifying and classical; instead of solid roman type disfigured by heavy double quotation marks at the start of every verse line, we have whole pages of italic print, elegant of line and light in weight, recalling and possibly meant to recall the humanist italic pages of Aldus Manutius. A final and it seems to me significant feature of the Capellian text is the paper on which it is printed. Both the 1760 Prolusions and the 1768 text of Shakespeare were printed on wove paper— papier vélin. Unlike laid paper, with its characteristic chain and laid lines produced by the mould, wove is a smooth-surfaced paper made on fine mesh screens woven from high-quality brass wire; a process originated by James Whatman the Elder in the 1750s. Wove paper was probably first used in Baskerville's 1757 Virgil, whose volumes are made up of a mixture of sheets of laid and wove paper, all subjected to Baskerville's glazing process. Wove paper production was new and experimental in 1757, and according to John Balston, in the major study of James Whatman, it was not until 1759, and in particular for the quarto Paradise Regained of that year, that Whatman developed the process to a level which satisfied his own criteria. 13 Wove paper did not enter general use for another three decades. Though the Foulises in Glasgow used unusually fine papers, and indeed used Whatman papers from 1747, they did not turn to wove papers until this became the industry norm in the 1790s. 14 Wove paper was used only in a very small minority of the publications of Baskerville , or of Dryden Leach. Leach for instance resorts to wove paper for such aristocratic special printing as An Elegy on the Death of Lady Boynton, a 5page quarto pamphlet published in 1768, but not for more common books. The stipulation of wove paper for both the Prolusions and the Shakespeare therefore seems entirely remarkable in 1760 and 1768, and seems in all likelihood to have been proposed by Capell. No doubt Capell, and Leach, valued the quality of Whatman's new wove paper itself, and hoped by its use to enhance the perceived quality of their printed text. Perhaps also, for the same more technical reason that Baskerville had Whatman develop new papers, including a wove paper, to use with his new lighter type, Leach and Capell thought it would help in the even impression of the relatively fine-cut Caslon type used for the Prolusions and Shakespeare. If so, the choice of wove paper may be thought of as a condition of the typography of these volumes. I have attempted to argue that these two major editorial enterprises by Edward Capell are distinctive in many aspects of their form, and that their distinctiveness can be shown in important ways to stem from Capell himself. It seems highly unlikely that the publishing house of Tonson had any part in the page or volume design of Capell's 1768 Shakespeare (equally, the Tonsons could scarcely have contemplated publishing an edition of Shakespeare which competed directly, in form or market, with the edition by Samuel Johnson in whose publication they had shared fewer than three years earlier). It is certainly true that the printer Dryden Leach was a willing and expert co-adjutor, responsible of course for the practical execution, and the choices involved in the execution, of Capell's wishes. No doubt many aspects of the two physical books I have been considering are the result of consultation and cooperation between Capell and Leach. More than that, it has been convincingly argued that Leach was in the forefront of the move towards a simpler, neater typography in the 1750s and 1760s. In his extraordinarily suggestive article on the `Revolution in the Layout of Books in the Eighteenth Century ', Nicolas Barker contrasts a page of the 1754 Act establishing the British Museum, with its large and blocky type, heavy capitalisation and cluttered marginal notes, with the Statutes and Rules Relating to the Inspection and Use of the British Museum, in a small neat type, without obtrusive capitals or marginalia, printed by Dryden Leach in 1768—the same year as he printed Capell's Shakespeare. 15 Leach had both the aesthetic sympathies and the craft skills to print the books Capell required. Nonetheless, the typographical features of Capell's two books, while they conform very exactly to Capell's holograph, do not coincide with a regular Leachian house style. For example, Christopher Smart's subscription-published volume of 1765, containing his Song to David, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, and Translation of the Psalms, was printed by Leach. It is not especially `modern' in style, with its heavily roman title page, and double-quotation marks used throughout at the beginning of every quoted line within the verse. Whatever the nature of the collaboration of Leach and Capell, and whatever their relative input, it seems clear that the style of the Prolusions and Shakespeare are part of that revolution of typographical layout in the mideighteenth century which is usually taken to originate with the work of Andrew and Robert Foulis in Glasgow from 1742 onwards. As Nicolas Barker has described it, the main characteristic of the new style led by the brothers Foulis was neatness, and its main vehicle the printing of the classics. The Foulis style certainly influenced Baskerville and Leach, and seems also to have influenced Capell. It is easy to rehearse a list of features that Capell's printed editions have in common with at least the smaller format reprints of the classics that emerged from the Foulis press in the 1740s and 1750s: a general neatness and plainness; lightness of type; small type sizes; a virtual absence of type-figures; absence of catch-words; minimal capitalization; the use of fine papers; the use of small paper sizes. 16 The difference between the page of Foulis and Capell, on the one hand, and the larger, busier and closer-printed variorum pages of Samuel Johnson's 1765 Shakespeare or the Johnson-Steevens editions of 1773 and 1778, is obvious . Why was Edward Capell at so much pains to produce, in 1768, an edition in page format and physical properties so much at odds with what had by then become a significant norm in Shakespearean editing? Why was he so concerned to separate from his critical text of Shakespeare the detailed and copious textual, explanatory and illustrative materials he was already preparing , and in which indeed he had an enormous intellectual and personal investment ? Capell's `clean', unmixed, unannotated text displays many of the characteristics, and some of the impulses, of humanist printing. Early printed editions of classical authors, of Horace for example, mimicked the densely populated page of the medieval manuscript, in which accreting commentaries surrounded the text. As many scholars have pointed out, this structure was challenged by the humanist scholar printers—Aldus Manutius, notably— who sought to strip away the accumulations of diverse commentary, and restore the intended authorial text, as they thought it, to its central and privileged place, uncluttered and uncontested by rival voices. This humanist tendency in printing was revived by Foulis and by Baskerville as a vehicle for (predominantly) the poetic works of classical antiquity (plate 11). E. J. Kenney suggests, of the Baskerville editions of classical authors, that they were intended to be read . . . by gentlemen who were also amateurs of literature and who liked their literature well printed. To such readers line-numbers, variant readings , diacritical marks, sigla, and the like clutter would merely disfigure the page. 18 Capell's `clean', unmixed text, courteously refraining from imposing explicatory annotation upon the reader, insisting on the primacy of the author and the authenticity of the text, belongs to a similar humanist tradition. Fine in physical quality, beautifully printed, clear on the page, it was no doubt aimed at least in part at a broadly similar market. It is designed not for the shelf or the library desk, but for the pocket—the moderately moneyed pocket —and familiar reading. It is the only text-critical edition of Shakespeare which, in its first-published format, might have been carried conveniently to, and used by a spectator at, the playhouse. Capell was a scholar, and substantial parts of his Shakespearean scholarship, in the form of his Notes and Various Readings, would follow years later in, significantly, a much larger format, and with an altogether different page style. In 1768, however, his priority was to produce a text of Shakespeare's plays which would visibly and functionally represent the dramatist as a classic of vernacular literature, a classic which might be read in the same way, and in recognisably the same formats, as the classics of Greek and Roman literature had come to be read. However different the form of Capell's 1768 and Samuel Johnson's 1765 Shakespeares, it is nonetheless possible to compare Capell's principle here with Samuel Johnson's stated belief that `Notes are often necessary, but they are necessary evils'. In his Preface Johnson famously urges the newcomer to Shakespeare to read straight forward, to read every play from the first scene to the last, with utter negligence of all his commentators . . . . When his attention is strongly engaged, let it disdain alike to turn aside to the name of Theobald and of Pope. Let him read on through brightness and obscurity . . . ; let him preserve his comprehension of the dialogue and his interest in the fable. 18 Only after this initial, unmediated and uninterrupted experience is the reader advised to `attempt exactness, and read the commentators'. Johnson here recommends an initial aesthetic response to the work in its entirety, very much comparable not only with Pope's generally anti-philological position, but also, and more specifically, with Pope's humanist distinction, in the Aristarchus passage of the Fourth Book of the Dunciad, between fragments and the glorious whole; or with his insistence that `men of a right Understanding generally see at once all that an Author can reasonably mean'. 19 Johnson allows the necessity of notes, and even the value of the formidable apparatus of variorum commentary. And clearly the annotations in his own 1765 edition are one of the major contributions to the philological side of the argument, the scholarly investigation of Shakespearean readings and meanings. Yet notes are still in his view an intrusion, explaining the crux but failing to interpret the whole work: `particular passages are cleared by notes, but the general effect of the work is weakened'. From the hermeneutic point of view, Johnson's emphasis on the local and limited interpretative possibilities of the note might put us in mind of some post-modern attacks on annotation as traditionally conceived: for instance, Anne Middleton's characterization of explanatory notes as `scattered raids upon local meaning', which cannot finally explain their whole text, and which are `insistently anti-narrative (or counter-narrative)', `tending to occlude the horizontal coherence of the text for the vertical plenitude of superimposed or parallel forms of information'. 20 Certainly the radical simplicity of Capell's text, far more than Johnson's proto-variorum format, is hospitable to `general effect', to narrative, to horizontal coherence. Nevertheless the extreme original purity of Capell's 1768 edition was at odds with a rather widespread contemporary presumption amongst textual scholars that notes should immediately accompany the text. The classical bibliographer Edward Harwood, in his 1775 View of the Various Editions of the Greek and Roman Classics, felt able to use this criterion without the need for self-justification, preferring the Amsterdam edition of Bentley's Horace (1713) on the ground that `the text and notes are exhibited in the same page' (p. 172). There is a telling echo in Harwood's words of Lewis Theobald's stated preference for Bentley's Amsterdam Horace as formal model. And a number of Capell's contemporary readers and reviewers found Capell's plan unusual, aberrant, and baffling. `What shall we do with an edition of Shakespeare without notes?' asked the Monthly Reviewer, writing immediately after the publication of Capell's bare text in 1768. The Critical Reviewer, in the same year, looks in vain for explanations of Capell's textual ` ipse dixits ', and acidly remarks that all the commentary which Capell was already promising in 1768 `might have been inserted in the edition before us, without hazarding its character of being a well printed book. ' And Charles Jennens, in his elaborately collated edition of Lear published in 1770, judged `that man . . . greatly mistaken in his ideas of beauty, who prefers the handsome appearance of a page in black and white, to the quick and easy information of his readers in matters necessary to be known for their becoming proper judges of the sense of the author, and the goodness of the edition'. 21 Other writers found more value in the principle of linear and unhindered reading that the form of Capell's edition so strongly favoured. A writer in the English Review in 1784, with not only the 1768 bare text but also Capell's subsequent extensive apparatus in front of him, congratulated Capell on having printed the notes `by themselves, not forcing them upon the student of Shakespeare, but leaving the perusal to his choice'. The question of where to place the notes is represented as one of `the great questions that divide the learned world', and is settled in favour of a mode of linear reading of poetry which foregrounds passion, inspiration and sensibility: . . . in poetry, and where the notes are merely those of an emendator or commentator , . . . we do not hesitate a moment to give the palm to Mr. Capell's method. . . . The soul of true poetry is enthusiasm; the most indispensible quality of dramatic poetry in particular is to touch and captivate the passions. But to be interrupted at every turn with a laborious commentary, and that, as it may happen, at the most interesting and masterly situation in the whole play, is perfect sacrilege to the divinity of the Muses. 22 Eighteenth-century editors and reviewers had, clearly, their own often sophisticated theoretics of editorial function and presentation, and conducted their own debates. It is also possible however to understand the intentions of Capell, and the response of his contemporaries to his work, in the light of a much more recent theoretics of the book. Jerome McGann (with others, and especially Donald McKenzie) has taught us to think of the text `as a laced network of linguistic and bibliographical codes'. 23 McGann herds under the term `bibliographical codes' such features as binding, paper quality, book pricing, page layout, typography, and the general spatial relations and interactions among the `primary' text and the different components of editorial apparatus. Many of these features have implications for the sale, marketing and audience of books. All may in principle enact the intentions of the makers of books, and affect the understanding and response of readers. Jerome McGann's discussion of bibliographical codes has been mainly concerned with primary writings, but bibliographical codes have consequences , as McGann is aware, not only for the original published documentary form of literary writings, but also for the edited forms in which they are subsequently mediated. Observing that `the very physique of a book will embody a code of meaning which the reader will decipher, more or less deeply, more or less self-consciously', McGann argues that to read . . . a translation of Homer's Iliad in the Signet paperback, in the edition published by the University of Chicago Press, in the Norton Critical Edition, or in the limited edition put out by the Folio Society (with Illustrations) is to read Homer's Iliad in four very different ways. Each of these texts is visually and materially coded for different audiences and different purposes. 24 Especially pertinent in McGann's discussion of the form of the critical edition , and its effect upon reading, is his distinction between linear reading and radial or spatial reading. Linear reading—what Tristram Shandy would call `reading straight forwards, in search of the adventures' (1.20.65)—is what the unexamining reader does in the case of more or less straightforwardly non-self-reflexive texts. By contrast, literary scholarship provides numerous examples of texts which encourage radial reading, in search rather (to borrow Tristram's words once more) of `the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it should be, would infallibly impart '. Of such books amongst the most striking are critical editions, the Cornell Wordsworth, for example, or the Oxford English Texts editions: One does not simply move through works like these in a linear way, starting at the beginning and then proceeding page by sequential page. Rather, one moves around the edition, jumping from the reading text to the apparatus, perhaps from one of these to the notes or to an appendix, perhaps then back to some part of the front matter which may be relevant, and so forth. ( The Textual Condition, p. 120) McGann has provided some of the most valuable conceptual yardsticks for assessing the forms of the scholarly edition, but in recent years he has been only one, if one of the most prominent, of a number of theorists and scholars addressing issues arising out of the forms in which literary texts are presented and annotated. That discussion has tended to focus on the ideological, on issues in particular of power, ownership, appropriation, and authority. Such issues have been traced with particular perseverance by one of the most prominent advocates of a post-modern approach to editing, D. C. Greetham, who has argued that our reading, especially as it interprets the codes of type size, text and page placement , and other visual and spatial phenomena, responds to the ideological and procedural `instructions' supplied by the textual editor. 25 Greetham identifies just such a set of ideological and procedural `instructions' in `traditional' clear-text eclectic editing, which, he alleges, `deliberately tries to prevent radial reading by concentrating the reader's eye on the "text itself" of the text page proper'. Greetham suggests, with other textual theorists, that the New Bibliography and the Greg/Bowers school of eclectic editing was naturally linked with the New Criticism, whose `critical concentration' on `the text itself' needed a textual equivalent in which the critic and reader was offered an apparently seamless and perfected text, with the tension produced by variance banished to the back of the book, or even a separate volume. (P. 12) Such texts conceal, according to the arguments employed by Greetham, their own motives, functions, and contradictions. They disguise the inevitable contingency of the text. They implement hierarchical structures in which the authorial text is privileged and apparatus occupies an inferior place. Indeed, Greetham remarks that some editions in his own field of Middle English prevent radial reading by publishing the textual notes and full apparatus in a separate volume, sometimes years after the text proper has been available. (P. 12). Greetham's strictures apply no doubt with a particular precision to Capell's Shakespeare: to its offering of `an apparently seamless and perfected text', its privileging of the author and the author's writing, its ejection from the text page of most (though not all) evidences of textual variance and transmissional indirection, its fragmented and drawn-out serial publication. The adoption of a clear-text format however, despite the crimes of disguise and coercion which have been imputed to it by Greetham and others, does not by itself rule out an awareness and pursuit of textual variance, a recognition of the complexities of meaning and of the need to explicate meaning , or an understanding of the connection between the text-critical and the text-hermeneutic enterprise. Concerned as he is with textual appearances, Capell is nevertheless deeply involved in the reasoned and supported text choices and exegetical acts of interpretative editing. Though Capell's text itself is humanist in its regard for the beauty of the page and integrity of the text, his project taken as a whole is humanist in another, philological sense: in its detailed historical literary scholarship, its text-critical responsibility, and its emphasis throughout on knowledge and interpretation. The text of his 1768 edition was always intended to be followed by a commentary and a comprehensive textual apparatus. The first volume of Capell's apparatus and commentary, his Notes and Various Readings to Shakespeare, did not appear until 1774, and the work was first published in its complete three-volume form after Capell's death, more than a decade after the appearance of the text, from 1779-1783. These three substantial quarto volumes present an extraordinary complexity of editorial material. There is a Glossary of Shakespearean words; lists of Various Readings to each individual play; a set of exegetical Notes on each play; a collection of illustrative passages called The School of Shakespeare; or, authentic Extracts from divers English Books, that were in Print in that Author's Time; and a verbal Index to the School. These disparate editorial materials presented in the three volumes of the Notes and Various Readings were designed to work together in justifying textual choices and in explicating the text. Capell makes this combined purpose explicit in his Advertisement to the 1774 Notes and Various Readings: `the sole intent of the " Notes, " is—to establish the Author's text, and to explain it'. 26 I provide reproductions of pages from Capell's Glossary, Notes, and School which all relate to a celebrated Hamlet interpretative crux (plates 12, 13, 14), the line which reads, in Folio and Quarto, `Unhouseled, disappointed , unaneled', and which reads, in the text of Capell's 1768 edition, ` Unhousel'd , unanointed, unanneal'd'. Capell's Note on this passage refers to his Glossary definition, which reads: unhousel'd, un-anointed, un-anneal'd . . . i.e., without receiving the Sacrament, without extream Unction, or Absolution in Articulo Mortis, here call'd—annealing, a Process of the Artists on Metals in order to harden them. `Housel' is an old English Word for the Sacrament, or Host receiv'd in it, which Skinner derives from— Hostiola , parva Hostia. ( Notes, 1.74). In the Notes Capell explains that he prefers to the reading of all the old editions the `modern correction' unanointed (the `correction' is to be found in Pope, Warburton, and Theobald—in his 1733 edition, though not in Shakespeare Restored ). The modern reading, Capell argues, provides the un - prefix for all three terms, and in the three original terms extreme unction is lacking. He rejects `disappointed' and `unappointed' on the grounds that ` appointing is a general word, . . . whereas the passage requires a specific one'. Capell here provides an emendation which modern editors consider quite unnecessary; but the editorial materials of the Notes and Various Readings provide what amounts to a carefully reasoned explanation, though the emendation in the `clean text' of 1768 taken alone would appear tacit, arbitrary, unjustified. The other two terms of the triplet are explained by passages in the School, which can be hunted down by the curious reader who is prepared to make careful use of the School 's Verbal Index. Aneyled is exemplified, and hence explained, by three passages from Thomas More's Works (1557). `Houseled' is exemplified and explained by two passages from the second volume of Holinshed's Chronicle, and a passage from Henry Chettle's Hoffman (1631). 27 The method of the School, in this instance as elsewhere, is a particularly pure form of the annotating editor's characteristic tool, interpretation by adduction. Exegesis is not thought necessary at this point; it is enough to select the pertinent parallel, and to highlight with quotation marks the word explained. The reader is left to bring this adduction together with the frankly interpretative comment on `houseled' in the separate note. In fact, if readers are to gather together Capell's account of this line in Hamlet in its entirety, they must consult no fewer than six differentiated and separated components: the `clean' text of 1768; the Variant Readings for Hamlet; the Notes; the Glossary; the Verbal Index to the School of Shakespeare ; and the School itself. It is true that readers are offered a good many direction signs: each note is referred to a page and line number of the text; the Notes frequently refer to the Glossary; the Index to the School enables the location of passages appropriate to the particular crux; within the passage , the word which Capell is concerned to illustrate is flagged by quotation marks; and, very occasionally, a passage in the School is there referred to a particular passage in the text of one of the plays. But these directions re-affirm what a complex maze of pathways Capell has created. The radial reading of Shakespeare in Capell's edition is made an especially disorientating experience by the difference in size between Capell's small volumes of Shakespearean text and his vastly larger volumes of apparatus , presented in a normal format of eighteenth-century prestige scholarship . The Monthly Review of 1776, addressing itself to the single volume of Notes which had been published in 1774, complained both of the tardiness and of the bulk of these first fruits of Capell's commentary, of `the awkwardness of huge quarto volumes to a text given in small octavo, . . . coming like heavy Falstaff so long after the battle.' 28 Normally the volumes of an edition— Pope's or Theobald's Shakespeare, Thomas Newton's Milton— `range with' one another in bibliographical format. Such volumes are designed to be bound consistently and to stand together on a gentleman's or gentlewoman's library shelf. Capell's 1768 Shakespeare `ranges' only with his earlier Prolusions; it is a volume not for the shelf or the library desk, but for the pocket and familiar reading, like the Aldine Horace, and unlike Bentley's quarto Milton, or even Johnson's relatively bulky octavo Shakespeare. In format Capell's 1768 text is abstractable, suited to the purposes of linear reading, of reading as poetry. It is mis-sized in its function as a component in Capell's completed edition, which may be thought of as a complex machine for a particularly elaborated and ergonomically problematic version of the kind of radial reading that McGann describes, in which: `one moves around the edition, jumping from the reading text to the apparatus, . . . from one of these to the notes or to an appendix, . . . and so forth.' In Capell's separation of the text from notes and apparatus in time as well as in space, however, there are resemblances with those modern editions of medieval texts which, D. C. Greetham alleges, precisely prevent radial reading (as Greetham himself rather differently conceives it) `by publishing the textual notes and full apparatus in a separate volume, sometimes years after the text proper has been available'. Greetham accuses modern intentionalist eclectic editors of service to what he calls `the hobgoblin of readability', and no doubt Capell, whose textual methods are an almost textbook example of early eclecticism, is guilty of the same charge; though for Capell `elegant readability' is a good fairy, and no hobgoblin. The paginary forms of Capell's edition articulate a mode of scholarly communication very different from that of Bentley's Milton or Johnson's Shakespeare. Capell and Bentley offer a radical formal contrast: on the one hand, Bentley's almost medieval or post-modern page, in which the editorial workings are not only exposed, but infiltrate and destabilise the Miltonic text; on the other, Capell's complex editorial structure in which Shakespeare's text is at the same time determined and liberated, and the reader effectively allowed the choice of linear or radial reading. There is an almost equally dramatic contrast between the clean unmarked text of Capell, followed at so great a temporal and formal distance by the numerous components of an apparatus generated by one solitary scholar, and the Johnson or Johnson/ Steevens Shakespeares, which lead the reader towards what Johnson calls `exactness' of interpretation through their cooler on-page conversations of plural expert commentators, the variorum edition being above all the place where the disparate kinds of explanatory knowledge possessed by many different scholars may be brought together, and where obscurities left by one may be resolved by the `happier industry, or future information' of another. These differences between editors, these contests on the page, are one measure of the tension in the eighteenth-century world of letters between the different varieties of philological and gentleman humanisms. I have suggested that in Johnson's statement on the necessary evil of annotation we see an evidence of that stress. No doubt Capell's edition might be seen as an attempt to address this cultural and literary problem; to invent an editorial form which allows for rapprochement between the demands of these two very different, but in Johnson's wish and perhaps in Capell's deed, consonant positions.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"THIS INSTANCE WILL NOT DO": GEORGE STEEVENS, SHAKESPEARE, AND THE REVISION(S) OF JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY by R. Carter Hailey *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1773 Samuel Johnson published revised editions of his monumental Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed., folio), 1 and, with George Steevens, of The Plays of William Shakespeare. The working relationship of the two men dated from at least 1765 when Johnson had published his first Shakespeare edition, a project to which Steevens contributed forty-nine textual and usage notes. 2 Johnson in turn encouraged and praised Steevens's 1766 edition of Twenty of the Plays of Shakespeare, Being the whole Number printed in Quarto During his Lifetime, or before the Restoration. While the 1773 Shakespeare was an ostensible collaboration, both the impetus for the edition and the bulk of the work were provided by Steevens. Johnson contributed some eighty new notes to the commentary, while Steevens established the text, wrote General Observations for The Comedy of Errors and Much Ado About Nothing (which had been lacking in the 1765 edition), and added hundreds of explanatory notes, many citing parallel passages from other Renaissance dramatists. 3 Conversely, although Steevens is nowhere identified as a contributor to the revised Dictionary, Arthur Sherbo has discerned an element of cross-fertilization between the two projects by identifying a number of instances in which Steevens's notes to the Shakespeare edition resulted in Johnsonian revisions in the Dictionary. 4 Steevens's scholarly abilities were eminently suited to both textual criticism and lexicography, and contemporary praises for his intelligence, industry , and wide acquaintance with antiquarian literature—especially that of English Renaissance drama—are plentiful. 5 Steevens's scholarly interests coincided with the aims of both the Dictionary and the Shakespeare editions, and his rationale for reprinting the Shakespeare quartos recognizes the affinity between the two projects: It is not merely to obtain justice to Shakespeare, that I have made this collection, and advise others to be made. The general interest of English literature, and the attention due to our own language and history, require that our ancient writings should be diligently reviewed. There is no age that has not produced some works that deserved to be remembered; and as words and phrases are only understood by comparing them in different places, the lower writers must be read for the explanation of the highest. No language can be ascertained and settled, but by deducing its words from their original sources, and tracing them through their successive varieties of signification; and this deduction can only be performed by consulting the earliest and intermediate authors. ("Advertisement to the Reader," Twenty Plays, 13) The last sentence might serve as a concise statement of Johnson's methodology in compiling the Dictionary, and appears to have been designed both to flatter Johnson and to demonstrate Steevens's own grasp of the project's nature and scope. If the reference was not sufficiently transparent, Steevens continued: Many volumes which were mouldering in dust have been collected; many authors which were forgotten have been revived; many laborious catalogues have been formed; and many judicious glossaries compiled: the literary transactions of the darker ages are now open to discovery; and the language in its intermediate gradations, from the Conquest to the Restoration, is better understood than in any former time. ( Twenty Plays, 13) This better understanding is implicitly the product of Johnson's efforts in producing the laborious catalogue and judicious glossary that is the Dictionary of the English Language. By reprinting the Shakespearean quartos Steevens contributes to the larger cultural project: he not only offers the public "the poet's first thoughts" (14) but also helps to preserve the literary heritage by providing the raw materials from which dictionaries can be made. Steevens has thus in a few lines insinuated himself into a productive scholarly association with Dr. Johnson, William Shakespeare, and the art of lexicography. John Middendorf has speculated that "from time to time evidence may still emerge to add to our knowledge of the possible extent of Steevens's anonymous assistance" to the 1773 Shakespeare edition (129). It is now possible to expand this statement to include Steeven's activity in assisting Johnson with the Dictionary during "The Year of Revision" (Sherbo, "1773," 18). I will argue that George Steevens, dubbed the "Puck of Commentators" by a contemporary for his literary quarrels and hoaxes, played a much more active role in the revision of the Dictionary than has hitherto been suspected, a role that, without acknowledgment, continued long past Johnson's death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Two sets of materials offer a fascinating glimpse into Johnson's working method in preparing the revisions for the fourth edition of the Dictionary. 6 The first is the Sneyd-Gimbel copy—so called for its previous owners—now held by the Beinecke Library at Yale University (shelfmark MS Vault Johnson) . This copy contains first edition (1755) sheets from the letter A through the entry for Pumpion (with several gaps), corrected and annotated in the hands of Johnson and an amanuensis and interleaved with more than 1,800 slips containing additional illustrative quotations. In The Making of Johnson's Dictionary, Allen Reddick mounts a persuasive argument that the Sneyd-Gimbel materials represent a preliminary stage in Johnson's preparations for the revised fourth edition. 7 A heretofore perplexing set of materials is a second partial and annotated copy of the dictionary, British Library C.45.k3, 8 which consists of mixed first and third edition sheets from " A"Jailer ," interleaved, with manuscript notes for revisions to the text. The sheets for letter "B" are from the first edition (1755) and are annotated by Johnson and an amanuensis; the remaining letters, "A" and "C"-"I/J," are third edition sheets (1765) annotated by George Steevens, 9 whose work is markedly different from Johnson's. Johnson reorders entries, adds new lemmas and new senses of words, and deletes some quotations while adding others. (The fourth edition would eventually include some 3000 new illustrative quotations.) Steevens on the other hand, although he offers numerous suggestions for additional illustrative quotations, concentrates on usage notes and textual corrections to Shakespeare quotations. 10 How these apparently disparate materials might have come together has been an enduring mystery. Prior to their identification of Steevens's hand, Sledd and Kolb described the problem: Some of the non-Johnsonian annotations seen to have been made with an eye to possible use in a revision; others relieve the barrenness of the philologic desert by the critical zest with which they compare Johnson's interpretations of Shakespeare in the Dictionary and in his edition and by their strains of fine contempt for Warburtonian audacities; and though most of them deal in one way or another with Shakespearean quotations, their date or dates, purpose or purposes and relation or relations to Johnson's own endeavors are no clearer than the identity of their makers. 11 While some of the mystery must remain, a reconsideration of the evidence will show that Steevens almost certainly annotated the BL copy in order to assist Johnson in revising for the fourth edition of the Dictionary, that at least some of these annotations resulted in printed revisions in the fourth edition, and that the missing third edition sheets of the letter B—whose place is taken by the first edition sheets annotated by Johnson—served as the printer's copy for that letter in F4. Reddick argues convincingly that the first edition sheets in the BL copy— those annotated by Johnson—represent a second stage in the revision process and were intended as printer's copy for the revised edition, but were for some reason never used. How they might have been mislaid or made otherwise unavailable is unknown and, absent new documentary evidence, probably unknowable. But, in the event, Johnson was forced hastily to reedit the letter "B," 12 with the result that the printed revisions in "B" are of a very different order and magnitude from those found in the rest of the Dictionary. There are for example fewer than half the number of new quotations that on average appear in other letters of the revised Dictionary, and authors like Bacon, Spenser, and Browne whose works frequently supply new illustrations in adjacent portions of the revision do not appear at all in the new illustrations in "B." Additionally, "B" is the only letter in the revision which is shorter (by four pages) than in previous editions, "because very little new material was added, while long quotations and references (as in other sections of the text) were deleted or abridged." 13 Reddick also asserts that "the corrections and additions" from the portion of the BL copy annotated by Steevens "were never incorporated into the Dictionary, " indicating that "Johnson probably did not have access to them" (193). And, after offering several possible scenarios to explain the odd juxtaposition of Johnson's and Steevens's work in the BL copy, including one that implies some chicanery on Steevens's part, Reddick concludes that Steevens annotated the third edition sheets only after Johnson's death, at the request of Charles Marsh, a fellow member of the Society of Antiquaries who had purchased the materials when Johnson's library was dispersed in 1785 (193194) . But my own collation of Steevens's annotations in the BL copy against the printed text of the revised fourth edition of the Dictionary (1773) indicates that a number of Steevens's suggestions were in fact adopted by Johnson . While he made no systematic use of the annotations—only a small proportion of the more than 760 changes Steevens proposed appear to have influenced the text of F4—in some forty-four instances Johnson either accepts Steevens's suggestion outright, or alters an entry in a way which suggests that Steevens's note was the probable source of the revision. 14 Why Johnson admitted only a small number of Steevens's suggestions and what procedure he used to incorporate those that were accepted remain obscure. But a substantial number of Steevens's proposed revisions—around 310 of the 760— are Shakespeare quotations which offer supplementary examples for words and senses which were already illustrated in F1. While one of Johnson's purposes for the revision was to provide additional illustrations, Shakespeare was already heavily represented in the word list and only one of the printed Steevensian revisions adds a Shakespeare quotation to an existing sense of a word. 15 (For additional authorities in F4 Johnson relied heavily on the Bible and Milton, at least in part because concordances were available.) Additionally , Steevens for some reason annotated a copy of the third edition (1765), while Johnson had prepared his revisions (rightly) from a copy of the first edition (1755). Dozens of corrections suggested by Steevens in the BL copy are to corruptions that had crept into the text in the transmission from first to third editions, and were thus unnecessary to an edition set from annotated first edition sheets. (They amply attest, however, to Steevens's perspicacity as a proofreader.) Thus if the unnecessary corrections and Shakespeare quotations are excepted from the total, Johnson adopted in some form roughly 10% of Steevens's suggestions. 16 I say "in some form" because, as will be seen below, some of the printed revisions vary to a greater or lesser degree from Steevens manuscript notes. This is not altogether surprising considering that, whatever Johnson's method for selecting instances to incorporate in F4, Steevens's notes, corrections, and quotations would need first to be transcribed on the interleaves of the printer's copy, probably by an amanuensis, and then set in type by compositors. Variation could have crept in at each stage. The Steevensian revisions that Johnson did choose to print take a variety of forms: some correct textual errors, others rectify problems with usage and etymology , provide additional illustrative quotations, or introduce new senses of words. A few cases add new lemmata to the word list. Several of the revisions correct small textual errors in Shakespeare quotations and thereby attest to Steevens's meticulous attention to detail and prodigious memory, for no Shakespeare concordance was available until 1787. Under To Abut, for example, F1's reading "Perilous the narrow" from Henry V is corrected in F4 to "The narrow perilous," and under To Croak 2, F4 corrects F1's "The raven himself not hoarse" to "is hoarse" in the first line of the Macbeth quotation. Steevens's expertise is not limited to the works of Shakespeare; in the F1 entry for Almond Tree, the first line of a Fairy Queen quotation reads: "Like to an almond tree, you're mounted high." Steevens, thoroughly familiar with Spenser's characteristic archaizing, noted that "you're mounted" should properly read "ymounted." In F4 the reading is simply "mounted high," with "you're" deleted. The original error had probably arisen from a compositor's failure to recognize Spencer's use of the archaic past tense "ymounted" and thus mistaking the "y" for the abbreviation "yr." A more complex example occurs in the entry for Cannibal, where Steevens alters the F3 reading of an Othello quotation from "It was my h e nt to speak" to "h i nt" (my emphasis). In F1 the word had read "bent," an apparent transcriber's or compositor's error that had been corrected to "hent" in F3; since F4 was set from a copy of F1, without Steevens's suggestion the reading might well have remained "bent" in the later editions. This series of readings effectively illustrates the interconnection between the Dictionary and the Shakespeare edition. The Shakespeare First Folio (1623) and Second Quarto (1630) both read "hint," while the First Quarto (1622) reads "hent." William Warburton, whose 1747 edition was Johnson's source for Shakespeare quotations, 17 had accepted "hent," appending a note defining it as "use, custom." In collecting "authorities" for the first edition of the Dictionary (1755) Johnson had uncritically accepted Warburton's reading, but when he came to edit Shakespeare ten years later, he rejected the Second Quarto reading , adopting instead the First Folio's "hint." Johnson prints Warburton's note on the reading, followed by one of his own: " Hent is not use [sic] in Shakespeare, nor, I believe in any other author. . . ." 18 The 1773 Johnson/ Steevens edition also prints both, followed by an additional note from Steevens which indicates that he was fully aware of the conflicting readings which had given rise to his suggestion in the BL copy. (The same quotation had been used to illustrate Antre, and again Steevens questioned the reading "hent," but the correction was never made.) Among the corrections suggested by Steevens and accepted by Johnson, roughly a quarter involve the addition of new illustrative quotations. 19 In several instances Steevens provides a quotation for a word not otherwise illustrated. Finding that Coigne "1. A corner." lacked an example in F1, Steevens suggests a quotation from Macbeth: "—no jutting frieze, / Buttress or coigne of vantage, but this bird / Hath made his pendant bed or procreant cradle." Reading further, Steevens found that Johnson had used this very quotation (and another from Shakespeare) to illustrate the same sense, but under the spelling Coin. There Steevens notes: "Coigne is not spelt coin in the ancient Editions or in Dr. Johnson's." In F4 both quotations are moved from Coin to Coigne, and the anglicized lemma, though retained, is not illustrated . For Dexterous, not illustrated in F1, Steevens offers "For both his dextrous hands the lance could wield. Pope's Homer." Johnson duly adds the quotation in F4 as "For both their dext'rous hands their lance could wield. Pope."; the source of the error "their" for "his" is unclear. Similarly, for Downhil adj., Steevens proposes "and the first stage a downhill green-sword yields. Congreve." In F4, Johnson prints "And the first steps a downhil greensward yields. Congreve." 20 This instance meets only the minimum requirement for illustrations: as Johnson acknowledged in the "Preface" to the Dictionary, "Many quotations serve no other purpose than that of proving the bare existence of words." But ideally quotations would be "useful to some other end than the illustration of the word" by the additional performance of an aesthetic or didactic function. "It is not sufficient that a word is found unless it be so combined as that its meaning is apparently determined by the tract and tenor of the sentence . . ." (F1, B2 v -C1 r ). 21 That is, quotations should preferably not only illustrate the existence of a particular word or sense, but additionally, through contextual clues, assist in defining it. Steevens was throughly familiar with the aims and methods of compiling "authorities" as Johnson repeatedly calls them. Under To Defeat, for example, Steevens argues that: "To defeat. Perhaps in the following instance means to alter, to change. Defeat thy favour with an usurped beard. Shakespeare." In F4 Johnson, satisfied that the conjunction of "defeat" and "usurp" fulfilled the "tenor and tract" test, adopts Steevens's suggestion by adding "to undo" to the definition and illustrating it: "Defeat thy favour with usurped beard. Shakespeare." The revision of the lemma Eisel again attests to the complex interactions between Steevens's editorial activities and his work on the Dictionary. In F1 Johnson had defied eisel as "Vinegar; verjuice; any acid" and illustrated it with a quotation from Hamlet: "Woo't drink up eisel, eat a crocodile? / I'll do it." In the BL copy, Steevens crosses through the quotation, adds a note which insists that "The passage from Hamlet is controverted," and offers several alternatives: "Whilst like a willing patient, I will drink / Potions of Eisel 'gainst my strong infection. The Complaint a Poem attributed to Shakespeare "; 22 "—Remember therewithal / how Christ for the fasted with Eisel &amp; gall. Sir Thomas More"; "Kned in with Eisel strong and egre; / And there to she was lene and megre. Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose." In F4 the Hamlet passage is dropped, replaced by the More quotation which comes from his translation of Pico della Mirandola's life of Johan Picus. Atypically, Johnson expanded the passage Steevens had suggested: "Cast in thy mind / How thou resemblest Christ, as with sower poison, / If thou paine thy taste; remember therewithall / How Christ for thee tasted eisel and gall. Sir. Thomas More. " Johnson corrects Steevens "fasted with" to "tasted," while introducing the reading "poison" for "potion," an easy transcription or compositorial error through metathesis and a mistaking of long s- for t- (if indeed "potion" had been the spelling of his source 23 ). It had been Steevens himself who had controverted the reading eisel in the 1773 Johnson/Steevens edition (10:321-322 n. 5), where the line is given as "Woo't drink up Esil? Eat a crocodile?" Steevens appended a long note on the reading "Esil," quoting Theobald's edition of 1733 in which "Eisel"—a reading accepted by nearly all modern editors—was first conjectured as the original of Q2's Esill and F1's Esile (Q1 had read "vessels"). Theobald rejects earlier commentators' notion that Esill/Esile is the name of a river in Denmark, contending that "there is none there so called." 24 Steevens, however , argues otherwise, citing an unnamed "old Latin account of Denmark" which includes "the names of several rivers little differing from Esil, or Elsill, in spelling or pronunciation." Steevens goes on to allege that "no" authours later than Chaucer or Skelton make use of eysel for vinegar: nor has Shakespeare employed it in any other of his plays." His comments are curious in light of the passages he had suggested in the BL copy which, as I have shown, must have been annotated prior to the publication of the revised 1773 editions of both the Dictionary and the Plays of William Shakespeare. The More quotation is roughly contemporary with Skelton, but, although "Eisel" does not in fact appear elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, it is found in Sonnet 111: "Whilst like a willing pacient I will drinke, / Potions of Eysell gainst my strong infection." 25 This is of course the very passage Steevens had cited in the BL copy, where its source is wrongly identified as "The Complaint a Poem attributed to Shakespeare." How Steevens could have known the line when annotating the BL copy, but not when writing the textual note for the Shakespeare edition, is curious. But Steevens clearly uses the Dictionary to substantiate his own reading of the passage, suppressing counter-evidence by advising Johnson to delete the Hamlet quotation. And Steevens's note seems almost certainly to have prompted Johnson's revision of the entry, although the means by which a longer version of the More quotation was used is unclear. In several instances Steevens suggests that an additional sense of a word be defined and illustrated. For Affection, Steevens's note on the interleaf is keyed by an "x" to follow the eighth sense of affection and offers: " affection. Affectatation [sic] / x No sallets in the lines &amp;c this [sic] / might indite the Author of Affection. Shak. Hamlet" and "—witty without affection Shak. Love's L.L." And in the 4th edition Johnson adds a 9th sense: "9. It is used by Shakespeare sometimes for affectation. / There was nothing in it that could indict the authour of affection. 26 Shakespeare." At To Clamour, Steevens observes of the second Shakespeare quotation—" Clamour your tongues, and not a word more"—that "This instance proves just the contrary to what was intended by it. To clamour bells is to silence them by raising them upright." In F4 Johnson adds a second sense of the word: "2. In Shakespeare it seems to mean actively, to stop from noise" and illustrates it with the suggested quotation . (It is worth noting in passing that "clamour" is thus one of the rare words like "sanction," "cleave," and "let" that can mean the opposite of itself.) When Johnson accepts a suggestion, the revised text is generally straightforward enough. For example under Caisson Steevens notes: "Likewise the floating frame in which the Piers of Bridges are built," and in F4 Johnson adds a second sense of the word: "2. A wooden case in which the piers of bridges are built within the water." In several instances, however, a suggestion is accepted, but with a bit of editorial commentary which indicates that Johnson remains unconvinced by Steevens's argument. In F1 Johnson, citing Pope, derives Argosy from the name of Jason's ship Argo. Steevens's note reads: " Argosy is as probably derived from Ragusa formerly famous for Pirates (hence Shakespeare's Argosine ) but now tributary to the Porte." In F4 the etymology is altered to read: "Derived by Pope from Argo, the name of Jason's shop; supposed by others to be a vessel of Ragusa or Ragosa, a Ragozine, corrupted." Here one may detect a hint of disapprobation in Johnson's "supposed by others." In F1 the word Comart n.s. is not defined, although it is illustrated by a quotation from Hamlet. Steevens crosses through the quotation and on the interleaf writes: "The word was inserted by Warburton, but no Dict. that I have seen gives any example of it." Johnson nevertheless retains both lemma and quotation in F4, but modifies the definition: "This word, which I have only met with in one place, seems to signify; treaty; article from con and mart, or market. " 27 That one place had been in the Second Quarto of Hamlet (1604-5). 28 Warburton's Shakespeare (1747)—the edition Johnson used for collecting quotations for the Dictionary —had accepted the reading "comart" instead of the First Folio's "cou'nant." Johnson's edition of 1765 follows the First Folio in reading "cov'nant," although Warburton's note defending Q2's "comart" is included; the 1773 Johnson/ Steevens edition reads "covenant." Warburton's note is appended, but is now followed by Steevens's rebuttal which echoes his note in the BL copy: "I can find no such word as comart in any dictionary" (10:151). Again the intersection of the two projects is manifest. In several instances Johnson adds a lemma to F4 that had been suggested by Steevens in the BL copy. On an interleaf Steevens proposes " Chargeful a word employed by Shakespeare," although, uncharacteristically, he does not cite a specific passage. (It is in fact used only once, in Comedy of Errors 4.1.29.) Johnson adds the lemma in F4, defining it as "Expensive, costly. Not in use." Here Johnson accepts Steevens's suggestion almost grudgingly, as if to say, "Well yes, it may well be found in Shakespeare, but I didn't include it because it's not current." Johnson's tone may be in part a reaction to the brusqueness of some of Steevens's notes. Under To Chance, for example, Steevens crossed through the first Shakespeare quotation, adding a note that "This instance will not do," and under Commiseration, where again a quotation is marked through, the note reads simply, "This is a bad instance." Steevens tone should not, however, be taken as evidence that his annotations were not intended for Johnson's eyes. Reddick, for example, argues that the annotations were probably made after Johnson's death since in several of the annotations "Steevens seems to speak of Johnson as a third party (i.e. ` Compliments in this passage is the same as compliments, and is so explained by Dr. Johnson in his Shakespeare'), rather than to address the lexicographer directly, [which] seems to suggest that they were not executed for Johnson's use" (193-194). But Steevens's use of the third person results from the habitual manner in which both Johnson and Steevens referred to each other in their notes to the Shakespeare edition. A search of the Chadwyck-Healey electronic text of the second Johnson/Steevens edition (1778) reveals that, in the textual notes, Johnson refers to "Mr. Steevens" twenty-five times and that Steevens refers to "Dr. Johnson" on one hundred and forty occasions. 29 While the great majority of Johnson's notes cite "Mr. Steevens" with approbation, on at least one occasion (cited above), Johnson observes that "Mr. Steevens appears to have forgot our author's 111th sonnet." Steevens is much more apt to contradict Johnson and his tone is reminiscent of that in the BL annotations: Dr. Johnson, perhaps, is mistaken. She had no occasion to have recourse to any other looking-glass than the Forester, whom she rewards for having shewn her to herself as in a mirror. Steevens. ( Love's Labour's Lost 2:385) Dr. Johnson has totally mistaken this word. In the first place it should be spelled severell. ( Love's Labour's Lost 2:407) I cannot agree with Dr. Johnson that a stride is always an action of violence, impetuosity , or tumult. ( Macbeth 4:439) I think Dr Johnson's regulation of these lines is improper. Prophecying is what is new—hatch'd, and in the metaphor holds the place of the egg. The events are the fruit of such hatching. Steevens. ( Macbeth 4:449) In exchange for Steevens's invaluable assistance, Johnson was apparently willing to tolerate a bit of brusqueness. In addition to the previous examples of corrections and additions inspired by Steevens's notes in the BL copy, there are also a number of instances where Johnson apparently responds to Steevens's suggestions not by revising but by deleting the passage in question. 30 One major stage of the Dictionary revision had, in fact, been the deletion of superfluities and the truncation or compression of entries to allow space for new material to be included. The extent of Johnson's editorial excisions is apparent when considering that although some 3,000 new quotations were added, the fourth edition is only eighteen pages longer than the first. 31 In one or two instances it could be argued that the deletion would have been made independent of Steevens's suggestion. Under Aroynt, for example, Steevens proposes an alteration to the quotation which was not accepted, but also notes that it had been wrongly attributed to Shak. King Lear, rather than to Macbeth. In F4 it is attributed simply to Shakespeare. Since Johnson frequently truncates attributions in F4, this particular instance may not have been a response to Steevens's note, but no space is saved by the shortening. In other cases, however , the deletion was apparently prompted by Steevens's notes. In the first Shakespeare quotation illustrating Addition 4, the third line in F1 reads "The sway, revenue, execution of th'last." Steevens indicates that the last words should read "the rest." In the fourth edition "of th'last" is simply excised, although no space is saved. (This is a rare instance where the attribution is expanded in F4, to Shakes. King Lear from F1's Shakespeare. ) The primary sense of Chamber 1 is defined as "An apartment in a house; generally used for those appropriated to lodging." Steevens crosses through the first Shakespeare quotation, from Richard III: "Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber." His note states: " Chamber, in this instance, signifies London anciently called Camera regea. " In F4 the quotation is deleted. In F1 Johnson defines Commere as "A common mother" and illustrates it with a quotation from Hamlet: "As peace should still her wheaten garland wear, / And stand a commere 'tween their amities." Steevens crosses through the entry, and notes on the interleaf: "There is no such word in Shakespeare. Commere was instead of comma by Warburton." Johnson drops the entry entirely in F4. One final example again indicates the cross-fertilization between the Dictionary and the Shakespeare edition. For the word Hail n.s. Steevens marked for deletion the illustration "As thick as hail / Came post on post. Shakespeare's Macbeth. " This had been the reading, first proposed by Rowe, of Warburton's edition (1747) from which Johnson had chosen his Shakespeare illustrations. And Johnson had printed the line thus in his 1765 Shakespeare edition, but appended a note reading: [Note: 4—As thick as hail,] This is Mr. Pope's correction. The old copy has, —As thick as tale Can post with post;— which perhaps is not amiss, meaning that the news came as thick as a tale can travel with the post. Or we may read, perhaps yet better, —As thick as tale Came post with post;— That is, posts arrived as fast as they could be counted. Johnson. In the 1773 edition Johnson, perhaps prompted by Steevens's corroborative note in the BL copy, adopts his own suggestion and prints "As thick as tale / Came post with post." As the preceding series of examples demonstrate, Steevens's sedulous labors in annotating the BL copy were utilized by Johnson, although not systematically so. The strong suggestion is that Steevens worked closely with Johnson over a period of many years on both the Shakespeare editions and the Dictionary. 32 And while Allen Reddick has brilliantly reconstructed the several stages in Johnson's lexicographic development, this new awareness of Steeven's deep involvement provides fresh clues about the nature and provenance of the British Library copy. The first edition sheets were certainly, as Reddick suggests, prepared by Johnson as printer's copy for the letter "B." But why were they never used for that purpose, and how did they come to be inserted between the third edition sheets annotated by Steevens? How Johnson or the printer might have mislaid the material must remain mysterious, but it is possible to say with some assurance what was used in its stead. It is evident that where the Johnsonian material for the letter "B" is inserted in the BL copy, Steevens's annotated third edition sheets for the same letter are absent; it would be difficult to imagine a situation in which Steevens would have annotated only the letters "A" and "C-I/J." I consequently suspected that when the printer's copy for the letter "B" was mislaid, Johnson, rather than beginning from scratch, took what was nearest to hand—Steevens's annotated third edition sheets—hastily augmented them with a few additional revisions, and sent the copy off to the printers. This scenario would account for the different nature and magnitude of revisions in the printed text of the letter "B" as compared to the rest of the fourth edition of the Dictionary. To confirm my suspicions I collated the first thirty pages of the letter "B" in the first, third, and fourth editions and through recension determined that, unlike the rest of the fourth edition, "B" was set from third rather than first edition sheets. The following is a sample of the more than sixty instances of shared F3-F4 readings in the collated pages: Location F1 reading Shared F3/F4 reading To Baa (Sidney) treble baas ⁁ for treble baas, for Babble (Milton) mere meer Baby 1 (1st Locke) plumbs plums Baccivorous (definition) A devourer of berries Devouring berries Balance (Sir John Davies) burden'd burden Ballad-singer (definition) employment it is employment is Bank n.s. 4 (South) Their There Barbarian n.s. (etymology) only foreign only a foreign Barm (Shakespeare) drink to bear drink bear Base n 7 (Dryden) trebles squeak trebles queak The first three are among the many examples where the readings of (relatively) indifferent accidentals in F3/F4 agree against F1. In serving to determine the copy from which F4 was set, they are valuable only in their sheer frequency, for in individual instances it is always possible that the compositors of separate editions coincidentally produced the same divergence from copy. More suggestive is the entry for Baccivorous, because it represents a rare instance in which a substantive change had been made in the third edition . Since the word is an adjective, Johnson had properly altered the first edition reading "A devourer of berries" to "Devouring berries" for the third edition. Had the letter "B" in the fourth edition been set from first rather than third-edition sheets, this change would in all likelihood have been lost. Most conclusive, however, are instances where F3/F4 agree in manifest error, where the F1 reading had been correct; it is highly improbable that the compositors and proofreaders of separate editions would repeatedly and coincidently commit and allow to stand identical variance from copy. 33 In order to assure myself that the letter "B" had been set throughout from third edition sheets, I additionally collated six pages near the end, from 3R1 r through 3S2 r , and found a dozen instances where again the text of F3/F4 agreed against F1. Since shared error is more conclusive than shared correction, the most telling example occurs under Bunch 4, where a line from Fairy Queen appears correctly in F1 as "A bunch of hairs discoloured"; in both F3 and F4, " discoloured " becomes the nonsensical (in context) "discover'd." Additional support is found in the shared misspellings of several headwords: F1's " Bivalvular " appears in both F3 and F4 as "Bivalvula," and F1 "Bobbin" as F3/F4 "Bobin." The letter "B" in F4 was thus demonstrably set not from F1, as is the rest of the Dictionary, but from F3. As noted above, the new illustrative quotations found in the letter "B" are both fewer in number and different in source from those found in adjacent letters. It is thus useful to compare the new illustrations which appear in the printed text of the letter "B" with the suggestion for new quotations Steevens had made in the BL copy. In "B," as with most of Vol. I, the largest number of new illustrations in F4 come from the Bible (there are 25), due largely to the availability of Cruden's concordance. But second to the Bible are Shakespeare and Pope with 16 new quotations each: this compares with 21 new Shakespeare quotations and 80 new Pope quotations in the whole of Volume II. 34 The over-representation of Shakespeare is particularly striking, and provides an additional indication that Steevens's annotated F3 sheets for "B" must have served as printer's copy for the revised edition. Additionally, I have collated approximately the first quarter of the letter "B" in F1 and F4 and found a comparatively large proportion of the sorts of changes Steevens had proposed in the BL copy (and that, on the basis of the BL copy for "B," Johnson himself rarely made). 35 There are, for example, small corrections to Shakespeare quotations under To Bait v.a. l, To Bait v.n., Bank 1, and To Beguile; a longish usage note following the Shakespeare quotations which illustrates Bankrupt adj.; new "authorities" (Shakespeare of course) for Baa and Beggarly; and the new lemmas To Bass and Beef-witted and a third sense of Bastard, all illustrated with Shakespeare quotations. Remarkably, there are two instances in the letter "B" of F4 where Johnson cites Steevens by name. The first, discovered during collation, occurs in the etymology for Beef-Eater n.s.: "from beef and eat, because the commons is beef when on waiting. Mr. Steevens derives it thus: Beefeater may come from beaufetier, one who attends the sideboard, which was anciently placed in a beaufet. The business of the beef-eaters was, and perhaps is still, to attend the king at meals." A search of both F1 and F4 of A Dictionary of the English Language on CD-ROM 36 revealed a second example in F4 under Bumbast: "falsely written for bombast; bombast and bombasine being mentioned, with great probability, by Junius, as coming from boom, a tree, and sein, silk; the silk or cotton of a tree. Mr. Steevens, with much more probability, deduces them all from bombycinus. " 37 Nowhere else in either F1 or F4 does Johnson mention Steevens. The confluence of circumstantial evidence supports my original conjecture that Steevens's annotated third edition sheets for the letter "B" served as the basis, and ultimately as printer's copy, for Johnson's revision of this letter in F4. At some point after the letter "B" was printed off, the missing sheets Johnson originally had prepared must have been located and were inserted in their proper alphabetical order in Steevens's annotated 3rd edition copy, replacing what had now become copy for that letter. That explains why the BL copy is made up of mixed third and first edition sheets, annotated by Steevens and Johnson respectively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Following Johnson's death in 1784, Steevens continued his work on Shakespeare. In 1785 a new edition of the Johnson/Steevens Shakespeare appeared, and although much of the editorial work had been entrusted to Isaac Reed, Steevens contributed new notes to all of the plays. 38 Steevens would later resume direct editorial control and in 1793 published another edition, in large part as a response to Malone's edition of 1790. In 1800 Steevens died while working on still another edition, which Reed published in 1803 as containing "the last improvements and corrections of Mr. Steevens." 39 What may be surprising is that Steevens's involvement with the Dictionary also continued long after Johnson's death. The copyright held by the original proprietors of the Dictionary (Longman , et al.) had expired 40 and, while their fifth edition folio—essentially a reprint of the fourth—was still selling at ¥4.10.0, two substantially cheaper competing editions began to appear in the fall of 1785. James Harrison offered a folio reprint of the first edition supplemented by a life of the author in one hundred weekly numbers at six pence each, while John Fielding published the first English quarto edition in forty-eight weekly numbers at a shilling apiece. 41 Longman quickly responded: To render this inestimable work, so necessary in the present age of refinement, more accessible to all ranks of men, it is proposed to publish a correct, elegant, and cheap Edition, printed from a Copy in which there are many additions and corrections, written by the Author's own hand, and bequeathed by him to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who has, with a liberality which distinguishes his character, indulged the Proprietors with the use of it, that the publick may not be deprived of the last improvements of so consummate a Lexicographer as Dr. Johnson. 42 Before the end of the year the proprietors published new and competitively priced quarto (Q6) and folio (F7) editions of the Dictionary, both in weekly numbers, which incorporated Johnson's "last improvements." That the changes were mostly minor and numbered only about two hundred and fifty went understandably unremarked. But such was the cachet of these "final revisions" that Harrison began to advertise, falsely, that his edition was also based on the Reynolds copy. (Since Harrison's was actually a reprint of the first edition of 1755, it failed in fact to include even those revisions Johnson had made for the fourth edition of 1773.) If the number of surviving copies is any indication, Longman and the other proprietors, with their concurrently published sixth edition quarto and seventh edition folio, easily prevailed over the competition. Equally unremarked was that the proprietors had procured "a corrector for the press [who took] some independent and fairly intelligent care that the sixth and seventh editions should be accurately printed." 43 It is highly probable that this corrector was George Steevens whose diligence in this regard was renowned, Malone having called him "one of the most accurate correctors of the press . . . in the world." 44 The evidence consists of changes which had long before been suggested by Steevens in the BL copy but which appear for the first time in the 6th edition. 45 Several are relatively minor corrections in punctuation and spelling. At Aim 5 in the last line of the quotation from Henry IV Part II "intreasur'd" is emended to "intreasured," restoring a metrically necessary syllable. At Air 5 (which had been sense 4 in F1), in the first line of the Lear quotation "vengencies" is altered to " vengences ." At Anatomy 5, in the quotation from Comedy of Errors "a needy hollow-ey'd" gains a needed comma. And at To Deck 3, in the second line of a quotation from Spenser, "Fit to adorn the head, and deck the dreary tomb," "head" is corrected to "dead." Such seemingly insignificant variants might easily be laid to the vagaries of compositorial practice if we did not have Steevens annotations in the BL copy to indicate that they were in fact deliberate corrections. A more substantive example is found at To Case 2 "To cover as a case" which Johnson illustrates with a quotation from Steevens's favorite play: "Then comes my fit again, I had else been perfect; / As broad, and gen'ral, as the casing air, / To saucy doubts and fears. Shakesp. Macbeth. " Johnson had, as he so often did, abridged the quotation. In the BL copy Steevens marked the third line for deletion—not to save space, but to preserve sense—but the line is retained in F4. In the 1773 Johnson/Steevens the passage reads in full: " Macb. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect; / Whole as the marble, founded as the rock: / As broad, and general, as the casing air: / But now, I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in / To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe." Steevens certainly understood Johnson's method of compressing quotations; but in the "Preface" to the Dictionary Johnson himself acknowledged that "The examples are too often injudiciously truncated," and this is just such an example. The excision of the second line creates no difficulty, but without the fourth line the final phrase is rendered nonsensical. In Q6 the quotation, although further truncated, for the first time makes passable sense. The range of Steevens's literary expertise is further illustrated by his handling of Direful. In F1-F4 an illustration from Pope read: "The wrath of Peleus' son, the direful spring / Of all the Grecian woes, O goddess, sing." In the BL copy Steevens crosses through the quotation, and offers a different version: "Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring / Of woes unnumber'd, heav'nly Goddess sing." As it happens, both versions are authorial . The former had been the original opening of Pope's translation of the Iliad, and the lines were printed thus in the quartos and folio editions of 1715 and the first and second octavo editions of 1720. The latter version represents a revision which first appeared in the third octavo edition of 1732. 46 While Steevens may have been unaware of the earlier version and believed Johnson's rendering to be erroneous, I find it more likely that he preferred the revised lines as representing Pop's final thoughts. Whatever the case, in Q6 the lines read: "Achilles' wrath, to Greeks the direful spring / Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly Goddess! sing." The evidence of Steevens's hand is apparent in Q6, but by 1785 the BL materials were in the possession of Charles Marsh, who procured them when Johnson's library was sold. Since Steevens and Marsh were both Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries, however, they must have been well acquainted, and it seems plausible that March would have allowed Steevens direct access to the materials he had annotated. 47 It is also possible that, with his prodigious memory, Steevens simply recalled some of the infelicities that had drawn his editorial attention in the BL copy but had remained uncorrected in the fourth edition. Whatever the case, it appears certain that Steevens himself saw the new editions through the press. And the Puck does not stop here. Over fifty years ago William Todd characterized "the proper discrimination and ordering of multiple editions" as "perhaps the most vexing" problem facing the bibliographer of eighteenth-century literature, asserting that "undenominated reprints are to be suspected everywhere," and that one may suspect "the presence of two or three concealed editions in practically every major production in the eighteenth century. . . ." 48 Such is the case with the sixth edition of A Dictionary of the English Language. In his magisterial A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson, J.D. Fleeman notes that this edition was printed by several different printers (including Andrew Strahan, whose account is the only record, L: Add. MS 48809 fos. 96-97), both as an impression for weekly publication, and for publication in vols.; the seventh folio edn. of 1786 . . . was worked off at the same time from a further impression of adjusted type . . . and also published in numbers and as a single vol. . . . The different impressions, largely from readjustments to the same typesetting, and the shared work, contribute to considerable complexity in the sequence of press-figures. No complete repeated sequence has yet been found in the copies examined. 49 Fleeman's explanation that variant press figures signal reimpression or reimposition depends on the unspoken assumption that the printing of the sixth edition took place exclusively from 1785-87, with the further implication that large quantities of type were kept standing. But in fact both physical and archival evidence shows that while the title-page date of 1785 is maintained , the sixth "edition" was reprinted from new settings of type several times over the next ten years. A full account of the complex printing history of this edition is beyond the scope of this essay, but several preliminary observations may be made. The evidence that type was reimposed from one format to another comes directly from the Strahan ledger, where there are notations indicating savings from what Strahan calls "overrunning," both from quarto to folio and vice versa (fol. 97 v ). But, within the quarto itself, I have found no evidence that suggests copies issued in parts were from impressions separate from those issued complete. 50 Publication in weekly numbers began 19 November 1785 and ran through 30 June 1787. But on 17 February 1787 the Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser ran the following advertisement: The Genuine Editions of/Dr Johnson's Dictionary/of the English Language (printed/ from the Author's corrected copy bequeathed to Sir Jo-/shua Reynolds) being now completed, may be had of /T. Longman, in Pater-noster-row, and the other pro-/ prietors./ The folio edition in one volume, the quarto edition in/two volumes; the price of each 21.2s. in boards, or 21.10s/bound./ . . . Subscribers to either edition, in numbers, may now com-/plete their books; and any person may begin with Num-/ ber I. and purchase one or more numbers weekly. . . . With printing now completed, the sixth edition was available in several forms. While distribution of the printing-in-parts proceeded, the proprietors issued the edition as completed volumes as well, following the general practice with serial publication. 51 Later gatherings—those of the latter parts of Vol. I, most of Vol. II, and perhaps the title page and preliminaries as well— would then have been printed in sufficient quantities to satisfy both forms of publication, while Vol. I gatherings which had previously been sold out in parts would have been reset and printed off as necessary to make up complete sets. (Type for the earlier gatherings is unlikely to have been left standing for sixteen months.) Six of the nine Q6 copies I have examined exhibit a pattern that supports this hypothesis: they are essentially invariant in the latter portions of Volume I and the whole of Volume II, while in the first two-thirds of Volume I most gatherings are found in two different type settings and a few in three. 52 Q6 provides a tremendous quantity of press-figure data since there are 141 gatherings in Vol. I, 137 in Vol. II, with the majority figured in both formes. One feature that may have contributed to Fleeman's puzzlement is that some sheets from a single typesetting are differently figured, most often with identical figures in one forme, and variant figures in the other. In comparing the BL and DVM copies I noted ten such occurrences in Vol. I; perhaps significantly, all but one occur between 5Q and 6T and the other is found in gathering `a' of the preliminaries, which would have been printed shortly after the completion of 6X, the final sheet of Vol. I. (In Vol. II there are only four examples, more randomly assorted.) I have also found examples where, coincidentally, formes from different settings of type have the same figure in roughly the same location on the page. And on at least one occasion a press figure actually undergoes a stop-press correction. 53 But in most cases in the sixth edition, different press figures imply different settings of type, and individual copies may be composed of a dizzying variety of reset and identical gatherings, depending on the number of copies of particular earlier gatherings that were still on hand when the decision was made to issue the edition in complete volumes. This possibility is further complicated by an advertisement that appeared on 21 December 1787: "GENUINE EDITIONS, . . . On Saturday, January 5, 1788, will be published,/Number I. of the Folio, and Number I. of the Quarto/Edition of/A Dictionary of the English/Language . . ." ( Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser ). The advertised "Conditions" are that the parts, consisting alternately of three and four sheets, will be issued weekly until completion, the folio to be composed of eighty sixpenny numbers, the quarto of seventy-eight. The process of serial publication appears to have begun again, while complete editions are still being offered at two guineas. Whether this new issue represents an actual reprinting of the parts or a new offering of parts left from the earlier printing has yet to be established, but entries in the Strahan ledgers which are not cited by Fleeman support the former interpretation. Under the heading "Johnson's Dictionary 4 to " is an entry dated January 1789 which records charges for printing a run of 2000 copies of signatures c-k—the preliminary gatherings of Vol. I which cover "The History of the English Language"— and signatures "B-3Z" of Vol. II. 54 These are the same signatures Strahan had printed in 1786 when the run had been between 3000-3500 copies. In a second ledger, again under the heading "Johnson's Dictionary 4 to ," are additional entries which record the printing of these same signatures yet again, with the prelims printed in January 1791 (2000 copies), sigs. "B" and "C" in July of 1793 (2000 and 1500 copies, respectively), and "D-Z" in December of 1795 (1275 to 1325 copies). 55 The copy of the sixth edition held by the University of Virginia must come from this last printing, since much of it is printed on paper whose watermark is the date "1794". 56 This edition (for it comes from a separate setting of type) is apparently intended to be indistinguishable from the earlier printings. The title-page date remains 1785 and the list of proprietors is identical to that in Vol. II of the earlier printing, even though at least four—L. Davis, W. Owen, W. Richardson, and J. Murray—were dead by 1794. 57 The collation also duplicates that of the earlier issues: Collation. 4 : Vol. I. a 4 b 4 c-f 2 `[g]'-`[h]' 2 `[i]'-`[k]' 4 g-h 4 , B-4F 4 4N-6X 4 . Vol II. π1 B3Y 4 3Z 2 2 A- 2 Y 4 2 3Z 2 Even the anomalous parenthetical signings which intrude in the alphabetical sequence of the preliminaries and the curious signature "4F-M" which appears on 4F1 are repeated. This puzzling state of affairs may be explained in part by a comment made by Andrew Millar—bookseller, publisher, and one of the original proprietors of the Dictionary —concerning Hume's essays: that he regarded them as classics and never numbered editions when there was little need to "puff" them. 58 Todd concludes that "A close facsimile was, then, what [the booksellers] oftentimes attempted to produce. 59 The Dictionary would certainly have been considered a classic—and, particularly in the unabridged quarto format, it continued to be quite a profitable venture for its proprietors. 60 With the cachet of containing the "last improvements" from Dr. Johnson's hand, the sixth edition would have required no additional puffing. But the proprietors apparently saw the Dictionary as something more than a cash cow, for as they reprinted it they continued to have it improved— almost certainly by George Steevens. In the 1795 printing of the sixth edition several corrections which had been proposed by Steevens over twenty years previously appear in a printed edition of the Dictionary for the first time. All are textual corrections to Shakespeare quotations: Under Censer 2, in a quotation from Taming of the Shrew, "Here's snip, and nip, and cut, and slish, and slush," "slush" is corrected to "slash." Under Chamberlain 3, in the quotation, from Macbeth, "We will with wine and wassail convince," the word "so" is inserted after "wassail." In the Macbeth quotation under Farrow , "Pour in sow's blood that hath litter'd / Her nine farrow, " "litter'd" is altered to "eaten." Under To Fast, in the Cymbeline quotation "Last night the very god shew'd me a vision," "god" is corrected to "gods." And under Green adj. 4, in a quotation from Romeo and Juliet, "Lies festering in his blood," "blood" is corrected to "shroud." Since the annotated British Library materials end with the letter "I/J" they do not include even all of Volume I of the folio Dictionary, which ends with the letter "K", and Vol. II is not represented at all. It is possible that Steevens annotated a complete copy, and that the end of the first and all of the second volume have been lost. I have as yet made no attempt to collate Vol. II, either between F4 and Q6, or between the early and late printings of Q6. But I have done so for the letter "K," which runs only to a dozen pages in the quarto edition. I was not surprised to find that between the early and late printings of Q6, there are two substantive corrections, both to quotations from Macbeth. 61 Most if not all of the changes Steevens introduced in seeing the successive editions through the press would have gone unremarked by readers. As Johnson had reassured the public in the "Advertisement" to the revised fourth edition of the Dictionary, the owner of a previous edition "needs not repent; he will not, without nice collation, perceive how they differ. . . ." Yet the regard in which the proprietors held Johnson's Dictionary as a cultural icon apparently dictated that if they were to reprint it, they should also improve it. And George Steevens, through his anonymous ministrations carried out over a period of nearly twenty-five years, sought "not merely to obtain justice to Shakespeare," but justice to Johnson as well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I gratefully acknowledge Prof. Allen Reddick, whose perspicacious comments on an earlier version of this essay led to numerous improvements both large and small; residual errors are of course entirely my own. 1 The first edition had been published in 1755, eight years after Johnson announced his intention in The Plan of a Dictionary. The Dictionary went through two additional editions in 1755-56 and 1765 before the major revision of 1773. Since I refer repeatedly to various editions of the Dictionary, I will employ the following abbreviations: the folio editions, first through fifth and seventh will be designated F1 (1755), F2 (1755-56), F3 (1765), F4 (1773), F5 (1784) and F7 (1785); the sixth edition is a quarto, designated Q6 (1785). 2 In a letter to Lord Hardwicke of 12 October 1765, Thomas Birch credited Steevens— "without whose Assistance that Work would probably not have appeared these twelve Months"—with propelling the Shakespeare edition towards completion. What contribution Steevens might have made beyond the forty-nine notes is unknown, although it is possible that he saw the final volumes through the press and advised Johnson on the "Preface." Hardwicke also refers to the imminent appearance of Steevens's edition of the Shakespeare quartos, saying that he did "not see the Use of such an Edition" (BL Add. MS 35400 fol. 350 r , quoted in Arthur Sherbo, Samuel Johnson, Editor of Shakespeare. With an essay on "The Adventurer" [Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1956], 10) 3 Johnson himself added a paragraph to the "Preface" of the 1773 Shakespeare edition praising Steeven's "diligence and sagacity." For a discussion of Steevens's contributions to the 1773 edition see Sherbo, Samuel Johnson, Editor of Shakespeare, 102-113. For the relationship , both personal and working, between Johnson and Steevens see John H. Middendorf , "Steevens and Johnson" in Johnson and His Age, ed. James Engell (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1984), 125-135. 4 Arthur Sherbo, "1773: The Year of Revision" Eighteenth-Century Studies 7.1 (1973), 18-39. 5 See the DNB entry for Steevens. See also Arthur Sherbo, The Achievement of George Steevens (New York: Peter Lang, 1990), 4, 6-7, 29, 44, 56-57, and Middendorf, "Steevens and Johnson," 128-130. 6 These materials were first discussed by James H. Sledd and Gwin J. Kolb in Dr. Johnson's Dictionary: Essays in the Biography of a Book (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1955), 116126 , and "The History of the Sneyd-Gimbel and Pigott-British Museum Copies of Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, " PBSA, 54 (1960), 286-289. A more recent consideration is Allen Reddick , The Making of Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, 1746-1773 (1990; rev. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996). Much of this valuable book, which reconstructs Johnson's methodology in creating and then revising the Dictionary, is based on an insightful analysis of the Sneyd-Gimbel copy, which is thoroughly described in Appendix A, 179-189. The British Library copy is described in Appendix B, 190-191 and the provenance of both copies in Appendix C, 192-194. 7 See especially Chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5. 8 Formerly known as the Pigott-British Museum copy. For convenience I will follow Reddick in referring to it simply as the BL copy. 9 The hand was identified by Sledd and Kolb, tentatively in 1955, and more firmly in 1960. 10 A number of notes correct small errors that had crept into F3, which in F1 had read correctly. 11 Sledd and Kolb, Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, 122. 12 In one of his notebooks Boswell quotes Johnson as having asserted that "it was remarkable that when he revised &amp; improved the last edition of his Dict[iona]ry the Printer was never kept waiting." Quoted in Reddick, 91. 13 Reddick, 96. Only three entries in the word list for "B" are substantially revised: Blow, where the four senses distinguished in F1 are expanded to seven in F4; Bosom, where six senses become ten; and Bright, where four senses are expanded to ten, illustrated with thirteen new quotations. 14 They occur in the entries for: To Abut, Addition 4, Affection 9, Affliction 2, Allowance 2 and 6, Almond Tree, Argosy, Aroynt, Caisson, To Canary, Canary bird, Cannibal, Chamber 1, Chargeful, To Clamour, Clump, Coigne [French], Comart, Commere, To Confess v.a. 1, Crescent adj., To Croak 2, To Defeat, To Derogate v.n., Desideratum, Despicable, Despiteous, Devious 2, Dexterous, Diuretick, Downhil ' adj., Eisel, To Embale 2, Emblazonry, Endamagement, Equipage 4, Fight 3, Fit n.s., Forgetive, Formal, Galleass, To Give v.a. 14, Hail n.s. 15 Reddick's count of authors whose works supplied ten or more new quotations to Vol. II of the revised Dictionary shows Shakespeare in 29th place out of 30, with only 21 new illustrations, as compared with Milton, the most frequent source of new quotations, with 200 (121-122). 16 Johnson similarly rejected a substantial amount of material prepared by one of his amanuenses, William Macbean, whose "relatively frequent observations on Scottish or other regional usage of English words which were written on the Sneyd-Gimbel slips . . . were always ignored" (Reddick, 99). 17 The copy marked by Johnson, missing vol. 8, is held by the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. 18 The Plays of William Shakespeare, ed. Samuel Johnson, 8:343. 19 They are: Coigne n.s., Crescent adj., To Defeat v.a, Despicable adj., Despiteous, Devious adj. 2, Dexterous, Diuretick adj., Downhil n.s., Eisel n.s., Fight n.s., 3. 20 The 1693 text of The Old Batchelour reads: "And the first Stage a Down-hill Greensword yields" (5.1.473); -sword for -sward was an acceptable contemporary spelling variant. The source of the variant "steps" for "stage" is again obscure. 21 Johnson soon found that limitations of spaces precluded his "scheme of including all that was pleasing or useful in English literature" and that as a result his authorities were sometimes truncated "to clusters of words in which scarcely any meaning is retained" ("Preface ," B2 v ). 22 A rare misattribution from Steevens; the passage comes from Sonnet 111. 23 In Here is conteyned the lyfe of Johan Picus erle of Mirandula (London: de Worde, c. 1525; STC 1998) the passage appears as: "Cast in thy mynde as oft with good deuocyon / How thou resemblest chryst / as with sowre pocyon, / If thou payne thy tast; remembre therwithall / How chryst for the tasted eysell and gall" (F1 v ). 24 For a detailed review of the textual issues involved in this reading, see the note by Harold Jenkins, ed., Hamlet, The Arden Shakespeare, Second series (London: Routledge, 1990), 555-557. 25 Johnson was clearly aware of the parallel passage since, in Appendix II of the 1773 Shakespeare edition, he adds the very direct remark "You forgot our author's 111th sonnet" (Note to 321 n. 5). In the revised Johnson/Steevens edition of 1778 the note stands much as it had in the 1773, but Steevens has added several supporting passages from Stowe and Drayton which refer to a river "Issell" or "Isell." Johnson appends a version of the note from the 1773 Appendix: "Mr. Steevens appears to have forgot our author's 111th sonnet." 26 As is typical of Johnson's method the quotation is shortened and adapted; in the 1773 Johnson/Steevens edition the full phrase reads ". . . there were no sallets in the lines, to make the matter savoury; nor no matter in the phrase, that might indict the author of affection . . ." (10:224). Steevens has added a note explaining Shakespeare's use of "affection" to mean "affectation," and adducing parallels from Twelfth Night and Love's Labour's Lost. Again the cross-fertilization between the two projects is evident. 27 In Q6 printed the year after Johnson's death in 1784, the punctuation is corrected: ". . . to signify treaty; article; from. . . ." 28 The passage occurs in Act 1 Scene 1, where Horatio is describing the defeat of Old Fortinbras by Old Hamlet. In Q2 the passage reads: "Against the which a moitie competent / Was gaged by our King, which had returne / To the inheritance of Fortinbrasse, / Had he bin vanquisher; as by the same comart, / And carriage of the article desseigne, / His fell to Hamlet." In the First Folio the reading is: "Against the which, a Moity competent / Was gaged by our King: which had return'd / To the Inheritance of Fortinbras, / Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant / And carriage of the Article designe, His fell to Hamlet." 29 Most, though not all, of these occurrences had appeared in the 1773 edition, which is the source for the examples in the following paragraph. 30 Under: Addition, Allowance 2 and 6, Aroynt, Canary bird, Chamber 1, Commere, To Embale 2, Equipage 4, Galleass, To Give v.a. 14, Hail n.s. 31 Sherbo, "1773," 21. 32 Steevens would later assist Johnson in compiling materials for The Lives of the Poets and was the only individual whose aid Johnson acknowledged in the Advertisement to the third edition of 1783. See John Middendorf, "Johnson and Steevens," 130-131. 33 Considering the sheer volume of typesetting and proofreading involved, it is not surprising to find instances where F1/F3 readings agree against F4, or where F1/F4 agree against F3. For example, in the entry for Bacon 2, F1 and F3 read "To save the bacon, is a phrase for preserving one's self from being unhurt," which F4 corrects to "hurt." Conversely , in a Milton quotation illustrating Barber, F1/F3 agree in reading the correct "locks" which in F4 is corrupted to "looks." And under Babble, the Shakespeare quotation is punctuated with a question mark in F3, where F1/F4 agree in correctly punctuating with an exclamation point. These examples in no way undermine the case that the letter "B" was set from third edition sheets, since variation that arises either from the correction of error or the introduction of new error cannot be used as evidence in assessing the setting copy for F4. (I am grateful to Prof. Reddick for pointing out these examples.) 34 Reddick, 121-122. In the Steevensian portion of the BL copy some 310 new Shakespeare quotations are suggested, followed by Jonson with 18, Pope with 17, Rowe with 13, Dryden with 8, Milton and the Bible with 7 each, and Beaumont and Fletcher with 5. Another twenty-three authors are cited, most with only a single quotation. 35 In these thirty pages at least fifteen changes appear to have been initiated by Steevens; by way of comparison there are forty-four instances in the more than nine hundred pages from "A" and "C-I/J" where Johnson followed Steevens's suggestions. 36 Edited by Anne McDermott (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996). 37 The OED, 2nd ed., rejects Steevens's argument about beefeater: "The conjecture that sense 2 may have had some different origin, e.g. from buffet `sideboard,' is historically baseless. No such form of the word as * buffetier exists; and beaufet, which has been cited as a phonetic link between buffet and beefeater, is merely an 18th c. bad spelling, not so old as beef-eater. " Steevens is however ultimately correct about the etymology of bumbast. 38 Sherbo, The Achievement of George Steevens, 24-26. 39 Quoted in Sherbo, The Achievement of George Steevens, 199. 40 Because the first edition had been published in 1755, the copyright ought to have reverted to Johnson twenty-eight years later in 1783 (a fourteen-year initial term plus a fourteen-year renewal; see John Feather, "The Publishers and the Pirates: British Copyright Law in Theory and Practice," Publishing History 22 [1987], 5-31). I have found no evidence that indicates the way in which copyright may have affected the fifth edition of 1784. Whether Johnson was paid again for the right to republish, or had by some particular arrangement given up all right to copy from the beginning, is uncertain. But the Dictionary certainly went into the public domain after Johnson's death, since there was at this time no right of survivorship tied to copyright, although Johnson himself had advocated a change to this provision. See Reddick, 171-172. 41 See Sledd and Kolb, Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, 127-133. The Dictionary had not been available in parts since the second edition of 1755-56; in 1775 Thomas Ewing had published an unauthorized quarto in Dublin. 42 The Morning Chronicle, and London Advertiser, 24 October 1785, quoted in Sledd and Kolb, 130. 43 Sledd and Kolb, Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, 132. 44 Quoted in Arthur Sherbo, The Achievement of George Steevens, 29. 45 Under Aim 5, Air 5, Anatomy 5, To Case, To Cast 2, To Deck 3, Defiance 1, Direful, and Jack 4. 46 I am grateful to David L. Vander Meulen for information on the variant readings. 47 On the interleaf opposite 9X2 r in the BL copy Steevens had teasingly suggested adding the abbreviation "F.S.A." to the word list, for "Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries." 48 William B. Todd, "Bibliography and the Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century," Studies in Bibliography 4 (1951-52): 42-43. 49 J. D. Fleeman, A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson. 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), 1:440. 50 As most readers will know, in bibliographical parlance, edition refers to "all copies printed from a given setting of type," and impression to "those copies of an edition printed at any one time." See G. Thomas Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State, " PBSA 69 (1975), 18. Fleeman himself concedes that "The ESTC discrimination between the vol. and part publication is reasonable, but difficult in practice" (1:440). 51 The proprietors could now compete fully and directly with Fielding who on 29 May 1786 had advertised both the thirty-second number of his quarto edition and "The First Volume of the Work complete, bound or unbound." On 4 October he announced the issue of the forty-eighth and last part and stated that he could now "lay the whole of it at once before the publick," indicating that his edition was also available complete ( Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser ). Similarly, Longman advertised Chambers's Cyclopaedia on 9 January 1787: "The work being finished, purchasers may be supplied with complete sets, in four hundred and eighteen numbers, making four large volumes in folio; or with as many numbers weekly, as suits the inclination or convenience" ( MC and LA ). 52 Two are the current author's copies, one is privately held by David Vander Meulen, and the others are held by the British Library, Trinity College Cambridge, and Lehigh University . In Vol. I, these six copies exhibit variant settings in nearly all gatherings through sig. 5E, with the DVM and BL copies most often agreeing against RCH1, RCH2, Trinity, and Lehigh, though in some gatherings Trinity varies from the other five. In Vol. II on the other hand, only three of 137 gatherings show variant settings in these copies. 53 At X1 v the DVM copy is figured "01"; in the BL copy this has been corrected to "10." 54 BL Add. MS 48815, fol. 118. Presumably Strahan printed "The History of the English Laguage" because he possessed the necessary Anglo-Saxon font. 55 BL Add. MS 48817, fol. 39; payments for the three jobs were made in January 1792, March 1794, and March 1796 respectively. 56 There are two varieties of the "1794" paper, one with the date in all four corners of the sheet, the other with the date in two corners. A copy in my possession (RCH3) may come from the same typesetting since its press-figures match those of the ViU copy, but it is printed on paper without watermarks. 57 H.R. Plomer, A Dictionary of the Printers and Booksellers who were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland From 1726 to 1775 (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press for the Bibliographical Society, 1932). 58 That this sort of puffery was common in the eighteenth century is evidenced in Thomas Percy's sardonic comment that "The booksellers of those days [i.e. the sixteenth century] did not ostentatiously affect to multiply editions." Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, 3 vols. (London: Dodsley, 1765), 2:262. 59 Todd, 42. 60 There is no evidence in the Strahan ledgers that F7, published simultaneously with Q6 in 1785, was ever reprinted as was Q6. New quarto editions, beginning with Q8 in 1799, appeared well into the 19th century, but F7 was the last folio edition of the Dictionary published. 61 At Kalendar, where in the quotation "Let this pernicious hour stand as accursed in the Kalendar," "as" is corrected to "ay," and, under the 2nd sense of the verb To Keep, where in the quotation "What! keep a week away? seven days and nights? / Eightscore hours? And lovers absent hours!" the time period becomes a bit longer: "Eightscore eight hours".</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TWO NEW PAMPHLETS BY WILLIAM GODWIN: A CASE OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION by Pamela Clemit and David Woolls *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction This article describes and illustrates the use of computer-assisted methods of textual analysis to facilitate author identification. The task was to examine two anonymous pamphlets on the Regency Crisis, prompted by the temporary mental derangement of George III from November 1788 to February 1789, and to give an opinion on the probability that both works were written by the future philosophical anarchist William Godwin. If they could be attributed to Godwin, this would not only add two significant items to the canon of his works, but also shed light on the development of his thought during a period of his career about which little is otherwise known. Since there was some external evidence for Godwin's authorship of one pamphlet and a possible external indicator for the other, the thrust of the examination was to assess whether or not supporting internal evidence could be found. The research dealt with five collections of material: the two Regency pamphlets in question; known political pamphlets by Godwin; other writings drawn from various points in Godwin's career; other known-author pamphlets on the Regency Crisis; and, finally, a selection of writings by Godwin's contemporaries , Thomas Paine, Richard Price, Joseph Priestley, Joseph Towers, and Mary Wollstonecraft, together with one example of work by his daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Both the quantity of texts examined and the length of the titles have required us to adopt a coding system to assist the reader in identifying the material under discussion. For example, "TP 15= Reason2.9 " identifies the author as Thomas Paine, shows that this is the fifteenth example of his work, numbered in chronological sequence, abbreviates the title, The Age of Reason : Part the Second (1795), and shows that we are using the ninth chapter of that work. Codes which do not end with numbers indicate that we have used the whole text, while codes with a single number at the end indicate whole chapters from a book. In the charts, only the initial chronological sequence code is used for clarity of presentation, while Godwin's texts are marked by squares, the two pamphlets in question by circles, and all other texts by triangles . In the text, the first reference to each main work is given in full and subsequent references are by shortened titles. The two pamphlets under discussion , once identified in full, are referred to simply as Law and Reflexions , respectively, to distinguish them from the texts of known authorship. Full bibliographical details of all the texts used, together with abbreviations adopted in the charts, are provided in the list of references, and a table listing the number of words in each text is given in an appendix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Context The first pamphlet under consideration, The Law of Parliament in the Present Situation of Great Britain Considered, was published by J. Debrett at the start of December 1788, prior to the parliamentary debates on the Regency question, and went into a second edition early the following year. Though the English Short Title Catalogue does not make an authorship attribution, nor record any other copies attributed to Godwin, his authorship is suggested by an anonymous contemporary manuscript ascription, "By Mr. Godwin," on the copy held in the University of Durham Routh Collection. 1 This attribution is strongly supported by evidence in Godwin's unpublished diary, where, according to his customary practice of recording the publication of his own works, he noted, "Law of Parliament published," on 1 December 1788. 2 The second pamphlet, Reflexions on the Consequences of His Majesty's Recovery from His Late Indisposition. In a Letter to the People of England, published by G. G. J. and J. Robinson, Godwin's then employers, was internally dated 16 February 1789, the day of the debate on the Regency Bill in the House of Lords (Derry 187), but did not appear until around a month later. 3 Again, no authorship attribution is made in ESTC, but a copy of Reflexions in the Routh Collection bears a manuscript ascription to Godwin in the same hand as that of Law. 4 However, in this case there is insufficient external evidence to support a definite attribution to Godwin. In a diary entry for 25 February 1789, he noted, "Write to the P. of E."—an abbreviation consonant with other contractions used elsewhere—but there is no entry for 16 February, nor for most other days in that month, and he did not mention publication of Reflexions. 5 The apparent discrepancy in the date of composition may be explained by the fact that Reflexions was overtaken by the events it sought to influence. Written in response to news of the king's partial recovery from 10 to 14 February, it warned of the dangers of an immediate restoration of royal authority; but the announcement on 26 February of the "entire cessation" of the king's illness, followed by his speedy resumption of full powers, made such an argument redundant (Macalpine and Hunter 81, 86). In addition, the month-long delay in publication of Reflexions may account for Godwin's omission to record the date in his diary. Yet these explanations for the lack of firm external evidence for Godwin's authorship of Reflexions remain conjectural. Nevertheless, a reading of Law and Reflexions supports the view that Godwin wrote both of them. The style of both pamphlets is adapted according to the different occasions and audiences for which they were intended. Law, written in the interval between the meeting of Parliament on 20 November at which the king's indisposition was announced, and its reconvening on 4 December to discuss the establishment of a Regency, appears to have been designed to influence the debate among the Whigs concerning the best means of achieving government office (Derry 50, Mitchell 122-126). Accordingly , it is written in a measured, logical style, for the most part, and includes detailed discussion of historical precedents. Reflexions, as indicated by its subtitle, "In a Letter to the People of England," was addressed to a much wider audience, the politically aware, middle section of society which had a voice in public affairs, and its style is more informal and personal, though it too includes much historical analysis. Despite these stylistic differences, there are obvious parallels of theme and technique between the two pamphlets in question and Godwin's known works from 1783 to 1791, which include political journalism, historical writing, and occasional pamphlets in support of the Foxite Whig cause. 6 For example, the authorial stance of philosophical impartiality found in both pamphlets is characteristic of Godwin's early political writings, in which, in keeping with his Dissenting upbringing and education , he sought to forge an identity as an independent social and political commentator who had "nothing to do with administrations" ( Law 53). Again, the method of both pamphlets is to provide a mixture of historical analysis and discussion of abstract principles, closely resembling the pattern of Godwin's writings in the second half of the decade. Typical of Godwin, too, is the claim to give equal attention to both sides of the question, while employing rhetorical devices to whip up the fears of readers—notably, the invocation of the spectre of civil disturbance—and win their assent to his arguments . Finally, the pamphlets share with Godwin's writings an emphasis on "awaken[ing] the true principles of understanding in others" ( Reflexions 60) rather than specifying firm conclusions. Such resemblances to Godwin's known works, while not providing conclusive evidence, reinforce the likelihood that he was the author of both pamphlets. In order to confirm Godwin as the author of the first pamphlet and establish him as the author of the second, it was decided to employ additional computer-assisted methods of textual analysis. In reviewing the options, some consideration was initially given to the cusum technique, which has been widely used in cases of literary attribution and in British courts of law; but this method was not adopted because its reliability has been questioned from a variety of angles. 7 Instead it was decided that the breadth of techniques used by forensic linguists would allow the most thorough investigation of the texts in question, and that those of a computational forensic linguist in particular would allow the processing of an appropriately large range of textual material. A forensic linguist is normally engaged where a trial, appeal, or disciplinary procedure requires an opinion on the authenticity or authorship of short texts, or on whether there is supportable evidence of plagiarism in a text. David Woolls is a computational forensic linguist who builds and uses computer programs as additional means to this end. These programs allow large numbers of texts of any length to be analyzed very rapidly once they are in electronic form. The data provided by such an investigation can then be used in forming an opinion. These programs are designed to work with whole texts or discrete chapters, as in this study. The branch of forensic linguistics represented here always treats the individual and collective measurements as indicative, rather than attributive, the emphasis being on the textual evidence which causes the plotting of the data points in graphical form to show a particular pattern, if any such pattern emerges. This textual emphasis enables us to discuss our findings in terms of literary style as well as usage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Computer Assistance The analysis employed a number of computer programs to quantify membership of word lists, to provide vocabulary listings, and to identify a number of different phrasal patterns. Two word lists were used, the "closed set" and the "core vocabulary." The closed set comprises words which are functional, irrespective of their relative frequency in texts. This list includes some 400 words headed by the very frequently occurring words "the," "of," "to, "a," and "that." It also includes numbers, which can cover several different functions but are normally reliant on context for their meaning. Occurrences of words on this list account for 60% of all the texts examined in this study. If words are not on this list they are treated as "lexical," carrying the content of the texts. The core vocabulary is a list of the 600 or so lexical words which occur most frequently in twentieth-century children's literature, and which form a quantifiable subset of the 40% lexical component of the texts under examination. (Its usage is explained below.) Two other specialist terms are used throughout the text. Words which occur only once in a given text are referred to as hapax legomena, and those occurring twice as hapax dislegomena. The assessment employed computer programs developed from authorship attribution studies, but designed specifically for forensic linguistic purposes (Woolls and Coulthard 49-56). Three measurements of the vocabulary are used: 1. "Lexical richness" is a calculation based on the number of lexical hapax legomena used by the author of a given text. The score is arrived at by dividing the logarithm of the full text length by the proportion of the vocabulary which is used more than once. This gives a higher score when the divisor is low (i.e. fewer words used more than once), hence the concept of "richness." Transforming the text length to its logarithmic value gives comparable scores for texts of very different lengths, reflecting the fact that hapax legomena are usually spread fairly evenly throughout a text of any length, but obviously represent a smaller proportion of longer texts. The term "lexical richness" refers to a writer's use of the vocabulary in a given text rather than the size of his/her vocabulary. (As a rough guide, a richness level of 700 to 800 is found in the news items of the press and a level of 1200 or more is found in poetry.) 2. The "lexical hapax dislegomena percentage" is simply the number of lexical words which occur twice divided by the total vocabulary. 3. The "core vocabulary percentage" is the total occurrence of words which are on the core vocabulary list divided by the total lexical usage. All three measurements reflect how writers have used their vocabulary, consciously or unconsciously, with no regard to structure or meaning but simply by levels of occurrence. These features are common to all texts and observations of the quantities of each may provide an objective indicator of similarity or difference, which should then also be observable in structure and meaning. All three measurements have been shown to discriminate between texts at the 5% significance level, which is the statistical limit usually taken to indicate that the results are not obtained by chance but reflect distinct differences. The first two measurements relate to research reported in Holmes (259268) . The theory underlying them is that comparison of the scores produced by the writings of two authors will allow them to be seen in different places on a scattergraph, when the lexical richness scores are plotted against the hapax dislegomena percentage in two-dimensional space. One author will appear on the left and another on the right, or one at the top and one at the bottom, depending on which discriminator is the stronger. When more than two authors are being examined, they should each appear in different segments . This is not always a clear-cut division, because there is no suggestion that authors always write in exactly the same way, but the theory maintains that the measurements used are likely to reflect general habits, of which an author tends to be unaware during writing, and that observation of these results over a range of texts will reveal a tendency in one direction or another. The third measurement used, the core vocabulary, arose from an earlier use of the programs by Woolls in relation to the development of writing skills in children. This set has also been found to be present in substantial quantities, between 25% and 38% of all lexical occurrences in texts, in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writing, and measuring the occurrence of the set has proved equally valid as a discriminator in writing for adults from the eighteenth century to the present day. 8 The closed set, though used initially only to identify the lexical words by their absence from the set, is not discounted in the analysis, since it can provide indications of authorship habits, and indeed is used by authorship attribution analysts where large amounts of data are available for precisely that reason. In forensic linguistics, the text lengths are normally very much shorter than any of the texts examined here, so separation allows closer analysis of the interactions to be undertaken. In addition, this separation reveals that in texts of greatly varying lengths the actual number of closed set hapax legomena and hapax dislegomena is remarkably stable. The texts examined range from 776 words to 13,074 words in length, but most have around 50 hapax legomena and around 24 hapax dislegomena from the closed set. This is why, in this study, all scores are calculated on lexical quantities, to eliminate potential distortions caused by the higher proportionate representation of the closed set in the shorter texts. The other feature of the lexical hapax legomena in particular is that they are usually spread throughout the text, not always evenly but in substantial quantity wherever an examination is made. The degree of regularity may be examined for any given text, to ensure that the discrimination between authors indicated by the lexical richness scores is in fact based on texts which broadly conform to the expected distribution. Where texts manifest different patterns, further investigation may be required. Such an investigation forms the core of this essay, following the initial stage of analysis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Analysis It was first necessary to ascertain three things: whether the known Godwin material and the pamphlets in question fell within similar boundaries; where both the known pamphlets by Godwin and the ones in question fitted in with Godwin's other writings; and whether any other pamphlet writers of the time offered alternative authorship possibilities. To begin with, a selection of known-author pamphlets on the Regency Crisis, by William Cuninghame of Enterkine, Capel Lofft, Jean Louis de Lolme, and Sir James Mackintosh, were found, scanned, and analyzed. 9 In addition, a sermon by Towers, a Dissenting minister and author of political tracts, who was, like Lofft, an acquaintance of Godwin's in the late 1780s, 10 was included in the study. Then, during an Internet search for materials suitable for comparison, full electronic versions of Godwin's A Defence of the Rockingham Party (1783) and Instructions to a Statesman (1784) were discovered, together with an extensive quantity of his other writings. The processing of all this material allowed the data comparison shown in figure 1. FIGURE 1. Godwin's books, essays, and pamphlets with Law, Reflexions, and a selection of known-author pamphlets on the Regency Crisis, plotting hapax dislegomena usage against lexical richness scores. This graph shows a division point of around 900 in lexical richness scores between Godwin's known writings and the works of other pamphlet writers in the lower left quadrant. That is, Godwin consistently uses more words only once in a text than any of the other writers. It also reveals a division between Godwin's earlier material at the top and his later material at the bottom. In addition, the longer works tend to form groups, with a separation between the essays from Thoughts on Man (1831) on the lower right and the chapters from An Enquiry concerning Political Justice (3rd ed., 1798) in the middle. The six books of Imogen: A Pastoral Romance (1784) occupy the upper right, though with a similar spread to the chapters from Enquiry. The known Godwin pamphlets are to the right and left of Imogen, with the two directly addressing constitutional or legal matters, Defence and Cursory Strictures (1794), sharing lexical richness values similar to the chapters from Enquiry. Although the other Regency pamphlet authors cluster together, this graph tells us nothing about how they normally write, since we have only one or at most three samples of each. What we can see is that Godwin's texts, which cover a wide span of his writing career, do not overlap or cluster with the other candidates for authorship. We can also see that none of the other writers immediately appear as plausible candidates for the authorship of either Law or Reflexions. Only Letters 1 and 2 of Lofft's pamphlet exceed Law in lexical richness, and both Law and, especially, Reflexions stand at some distance from what is otherwise a distinctive group. (Both Cuninghame and Mackintosh argue against the case for Parliament's right to appoint a Regent proposed in Law, so are unlikely alternative authors on those grounds as well.) Towers and De Lolme stand furthest from any known Godwin material. Lofft's pamphlet is later than Law, comprising three letters dated 8, 13, and 14 December 1788, each reacting to the latest developments in the parliamentary debates and all supporting the underlying position set out in Law and Reflexions. But, as already noted, the Lofft scores have more in common with the other Regency pamphlet writers than with known Godwin material of the time. Lofft's pamphlet also displays a distinctive feature in the way that he refers to kings and dukes: he adopts abbreviations, such as "H.III," "R.II," and "D. of York;" but these are entirely absent from Law. Perhaps most significantly, Lofft adds in a footnote to a passage cited from the parliamentary debates, "I substitute only the word KING instead of MONARCH : as an English constitutional word, more parliamentary, and more consonant to the occasion" ( Letters2 32); whereas the word "monarch" appears without comment ten times in Reflexions and twice in Law. As for the relationship between Law and Reflexions and Godwin's known writings, Reflexions sits firmly within the Imogen books and just to the right of Defence and Strictures. Law is within the hapax dislegomena boundaries of the Godwin material closest in chronology, but has the lowest lexical richness score. From this analysis, it appeared that there was a higher probability that Reflexions could be attributed to Godwin than Law. This finding prompted a further stage of comparison between Law and Reflexions, Godwin's known writings, and texts by other authors writing on political and philosophical subjects in the same period. Comparison of Godwin's texts with a selection of writings by Paine, Price, Priestley, and Wollstonecraft, together with one text by Mary Shelley, not only allowed a confirmation of the distinction between Godwin and the others at the lexical richness/ hapax dislegomena levels, but also revealed a definite feature in respect of Godwin's individual use, or rather lack of use, of the core vocabulary, as shown in figure 2. FIGURE 2. Godwin versus other writers, plotting core vocabulary usage against lexical richness scores. The great majority of Godwin's texts fall into the lower half of the graph, showing that, in all but one of his texts, less than 23% of the lexical content is formed by the core vocabulary and most contain less than 20%, and that this is very much a feature of his writing throughout his career. The majority of the other authors collect at the top, inhabiting the 22% to 33% range. The only author with a higher lexical richness score than Godwin is his daughter, Mary Shelley. Paine's texts group in the upper left quadrant. Among the known authors on the Regency Crisis, Lofft shares with Godwin a tendency for low use of the core vocabulary. De Lolme, who was a native of Geneva, shows a much higher usage of the core vocabulary than any text except Paine's Common Sense (1776). De Lolme's method of argument is also different from that of the other Regency pamphlet authors, being much more narrative than polemical. It may be that there is common ground in the upbringing and education of the other writers, which influenced their use of language, but that is beyond the scope of this paper. 11 The fact that Godwin is not alone in his low usage of the core vocabulary does not diminish the force of the observation that this characteristic is a strong feature of his writing . The scores of Thoughts, for example, are similar to those of Defence, Instructions, and Strictures. The only other work examined here which scores less than 22% for core vocabulary is Price's Additional Observations on . . . Civil Liberty (1777). Though the other Price text used, A Discourse on the Love of our Country (1789), appears in higher areas of the graph, the proximity of Add.Observ. to Law on both scores measured here suggests that Price might offer an alternative authorship for Law —a possibility explored further below. At present the important factor is that both Law and Reflexions sit firmly within the area occupied by all the known Godwin material in the core vocabulary scores. This finding provides additional support for the case that Godwin is the author of Reflexions and suggests that he remains a possible author of Law. To confirm the difference between Godwin and other writers of the same period, more data was required. The only relevant contemporary author for whom a substantial amount of electronic data could be found for comparative purposes was Paine. Figure 3 shows the results of comparing all the FIGURE 3. Godwin, Paine, and Price, with Law and Reflexions, plotting core vocabulary usage against lexical richness scores. Godwin material with a selection of Paine's writings, Law, and Reflexions. This chart shows a division between Paine and Godwin from left to right at the 900 mark similar to the division noted in figure 1. Paine's works, with the exception of Rights of Man: Part the Second (1792), are grouped in the same way that Godwin's writings are grouped in figure 1. Chapters 1 and 2 of Rights are each much shorter than all the other samples, which may account for their separation from chapters 3 and 4, but they were included for the sake of completeness and to show that, while the hapax dislegomena percentage is being affected by the difference in length, the lexical richness scores are grouped within similar boundaries to other related sets of texts. Since the works selected cover a period of many years in the case of both authors, we can have some confidence that the measurements are indicating distinctive differences in the use of vocabulary between the two writers. Given that the more limited material from other authors can also be recognized as different from Godwin's, we can be reasonably sure that we have identified a further stylistic feature of his writing in a high lexical richness score. Price is included here because he has already been identified as a potential alternative author of Law. His two works straddle the 900 boundary on the lower limit of Godwin's identified levels. These works were written 12 years apart and on different subjects, so there is no reason why they should cluster any more closely than they do. It can further be seen from figure 3 that Reflexions is firmly on the Godwin side and Law equally firmly on the Paine side, and that Price's Add. Observ. is even closer to Law than any of Paine's work. We also have an indication that Paine was writing differently from his norm in chapters 3 and 4 of Rights, since the other texts sit in the lower/middle part of the graph. If either Paine or Godwin were the author of Law, it is evident that this work shows divergence from what might be called their normal style, as identified by the statistics. If Price were the author, we would expect a similarity in style, since both works are found in the upper right region, closer to Godwin's material. So the task was to see which of these possibilities was most likely. At this point, the statistical analytical tools were replaced with vocabulary and phrase analysis tools. The total length of the Paine and Godwin texts used (approximately 50,000 words for Paine, and approximately 100,000 words for Godwin) was sufficient to allow a limited investigation into the function words used by each, with a view to observing potential marked differences , so that such apparently distinctive words could be looked for in each of the pamphlets in question. This investigation, though insufficient to be conclusive on its own, held the possibility of providing supporting evidence for our other findings. It revealed that three function words showed marked differences in usage: both "or" and "on" were used relatively infrequently by Godwin, while he showed a marked preference for "upon" in comparison to both Paine and Price. These patterns were also found in both Law and Reflexions , as shown in table 1. TABLE 1 Normalised occurrences per 10,000 words Godwin Law Reflexions Price Paine Or 28 33 16 85 64 On 15 19 12 51 48 Upon 41 44 44 5 15 This finding was then checked against the other data examined and the low use of "on" and the high use of "upon" was found to be particular to Godwin . The incidence of "or" was generally similar as well. It would appear that in a wider test of functional vocabulary markers, these two items would be clear candidates as Godwin discriminators. Next, file comparison at vocabulary and phrase level was undertaken between all three known Godwin pamphlets and the two pamphlets in question . The greatest vocabulary overlap was between Law and Reflexions, which was not unexpected because of similarity in material, but which produced a sufficiently high score to have caused an investigation into potential sharing of material if that level had been reached by two different students in the present-day university setting for which the program, CopyCatch, is intended. 12 CopyCatch is the diagnostic element of the tools used above, which is specifically designed to look for shared vocabulary in work on the same topic which is supposed to have been produced independently. The greater the proportion of shared vocabulary which appears in two apparently related texts, the greater the possibility that the texts were produced by plagiarism, collusion, or undesirable co-operation. But CopyCatch can also indicate a tendency of one or both authors to repeat themselves, since such repetition, particularly on the topic or sub-topics, will cause the proportion of the shared vocabulary to increase. It was this practice which was highlighted by the initial examination of Law and Reflexions using this program. In addition, CopyCatch allows comparison of phrase use between any two files it has examined, enabling us to ascertain whether repetition is occurring at the phrase level. In the cases of Law, Defence, and Strictures, this analysis showed a great deal of direct or related phrasal repetition within each of those texts, with relatively little phrasal similarity observable within any of the other texts used for purposes of comparison. Table 2 presents only some of the extraordinary amount of direct phrasal repetition in Law. It is not the phrases themselves but the number of times they appear which makes this text so different from all the others examined. In addition, there are in Law 20 instances of the phrase, "the duke of [Bedford/Gloucester/York] ." We find similar repetition over distance in Strictures, though not on such a wide scale, as shown in table 3. (The numbers following the examples indicate which sentences are being identified to show the distances between occurrences.) TABLE 2 Phrases repeated in Law, showing number of occurrences "a parliament was summoned" 7 "the two houses of parliament" 6 "was virtually in the hands of the king's uncles" 2 "a council of regency" 7 "the regency of a single person" 5 "the king alone" 5 "in the reign of king [X] the [Y]" 14 "king [X] the [Y]" 43 TABLE 3 Repeated phrases in Strictures, with sentence number identified "guilty of High Treason" ( Strictures 97 and 116) "Justice implicitly confesses himself" ( Strictures 73) "Justice implicitly confesses, that" ( Strictures 67) "overawe the legislative body" ( Strictures 79 and 189) This phrasal repetition demonstrates a similarity of technique between the author of Strictures and the author of Law, though such repetition is much more markedly evident in Law than in Strictures or Defence, being especially concentrated around the historical sections. The author's method in Law was to name each king in full, discuss the nature of the incapacity, the circumstances in which parliaments were summoned and the outcome, so the vocabulary repetition was occasioned by the chosen structure of argument. One effect of this technique was to reduce the lexical vocabulary substantially in comparison to the other texts of similar length. The other effect was to reduce the normal occurrence of hapax legomena within this text, resulting in a lower percentage of once-only occurrence and hence a lower lexical richness score, which, as noted above, uses this percentage as one of its components. As mentioned in the discussion of vocabulary measurements, the formula used for calculating lexical richness expects a degree of regularity of occurrence of lexical items throughout a given text. Thus the presence of this feature needs to be confirmed to establish that this is in fact the case. An examination of all the pamphlets, together with examples of works by Paine and Price, demonstrates that there is a clear difference in pattern between the known pamphlets by Godwin and Reflexions on the one hand, and the examples by Paine and Price on the other, with Law revealing its idiosyncratic construction, as shown in table 4. Here it can be seen that the three known Godwin pamphlets start with, and generally maintain, a high quantity of hapax legomena, while the two works by Price and chapter 4 of Paine's Rights start with a much smaller quantity, which chapter 4 of Rights maintains but the works by Price increase . Both Law and Reflexions share the high opening and closing quantity found in Godwin's other works, but Law has a substantial drop in the middle segment, which is in fact much wider than simply this segment. This is | TABLE 4 Hapax legomena IN FULL TEXT SHOWN FOR THEIR OCCURRENCE IN THREE 1000-WORD SEGMENTS PER TEXT Instructions Defence Strictures Law Reflexions Rights 2.4 Discourse Add. Observ. First 1000 words 131 134 178 134 129 70 106 59 Mid 1000 words 124 146 128 96 130 93 124 114 Last 1000 words 166 132 114 140 123 71 133 132 where the lengthy laying-out of historical precedents is placed. So the opening and closing sections in both cases are not only close to Godwin's known pamphlets, but also distinct from Paine and distinct from Price. The drop can be explained only by heavier repetition of vocabulary, and the question then is whether this repetitious style is similar to that used by the other two authors, or of a distinctive nature. The presence of a distinctive repetitious effect in Godwin's writing was confirmed by a detailed vocabulary analysis, summarized in table 5. TABLE 5 Word frequency occurrences and percentages of lexical items they represent Words Law Instructions Defence Strictures Reflexions Add. Observ. Rights2.4 21+ 17 3 6 8 2 11 5 6+ % of Lex Items 138 121 87 80 73 123 101 21+ 14% 5% 5% 11% 1% 12% 8% 6+ 41% 26% 28% 32% 20% 39% 38% This investigation found that Law contained an unusually large number of words repeated 21 times or more, and an even more unusually large number of words occurring 6 times or more. In comparison, Instructions, which is 30% longer than Law, had only 3 words occurring 21 times or more and 121 words occurring 6 times or more. Chapter 4 of Rights shows a higher 6+ rating but also a much lower 21+ rating, indicating a different vocabulary spread through the text. This lowering of overall lexical vocabulary usage in Law, together with the tendency to repeat entire phrases, also affects the hapax dislegomena percentage, since, even though the proportionate number of hapax dislegomena in the full text remains much the same, the percentage they form of the lexical vocabulary increases. These two factors imply a twoway shift, leftwards and upwards, from what might be called a normal position , if the repetition were not so marked. It would appear that the heavy repetition is a major contributory factor in placing Law where it is in figure 2. This being the case, the expected position for a less repetitious text would be much closer to the Imogen books. As already noted, chapters 3 and 4 of Rights mark a move away from the rest of Paine's material, but in this case the movement is largely the result of the dominance of a single vocabulary item, "government," which occurs over 100 times in one chapter and over 80 in the other. Such phrasal repetition as can be observed in Paine is very rarely exact, compared with the numerous examples of exact repetition in Law noted in table 2. The move in Paine is simply a gentle rise above the normal pattern. From this combination of factors, it would seem very unlikely that Paine offers an alternative authorship for Law. Next the disproportionate number of words used frequently in Law in comparison to the other texts was further explored. It was found that in the other texts, once the main human subjects, Lord Rockingham and Lord Chief Justice Eyre, and the terms "Lord" or "Lordship" are set aside, the next significant items are low in all but Strictures, where the non-human subject is the law of treason, which accounts for the higher frequency of this term in the pamphlet. These items are all strongly topic-related and reflect the expected frequency of the main topic vocabulary. In contrast, though there are numerous human subjects in the list of kings and dukes referred to in Law, their use is supportive to the main topic of the role of Parliament in the appointment of a Regent. Only three of the four most frequent words can be strongly identified with this topic: "parliament," "regency," and "authority," together with "government." The most frequent, "king," though relevant to the topic, owes its high frequency to the number of times a specific king is cited in the discussion of historical precedents, as indicated by the examples above. It can be seen that Price's Add.Observ. also has a substantial amount of vocabulary occurring more than 20 times in a similar number of words, but examination shows that all of this vocabulary is subject-matter related, so this marks a difference from rather than a similarity to the style of Law. The lower figure in chapter 4 of Rights is also strongly subject-matter related and dominated by the term "government," as noted above. There is no element of repetition of lists in either text, as found in Law. The 6+ percentages are also revealing. Godwin's known pamphlets and Reflexions are all noticeably lower than either the Paine or Price examples, and it is now apparent that the statistics for Law are heavily affected by the presence of non-topic related repetition, the absence of which would drop the 6+ level of 41% substantially . All this leads to the conclusion that the lexical richness positions of Paine and Price reflect their normal usage of vocabulary. The proximity of Law to their positions is a result of disruption caused by repetition. This implies that the author of Law has a normal lexical richness score substantially higher than in this particular work, and this in turn suggests that the author of Law was neither Paine nor Price, leaving Godwin as the only likely candidate from those examined. This being the case, it might be expected that some positive vocabulary or syntactic evidence would be found linking both Law and Reflexions with the known Godwin material, in addition to the function words identified above. Comparison of vocabularies across the files showed that such evidence certainly exists. First, the words "measure" and "measures," used almost always in relation to parliamentary procedures, appear in all three attested Godwin pamphlets and in both pamphlets under consideration, and in very similar frequencies: 13 times in Law, 8 times in Strictures, and 11 times in the other three. These words are not found in anything like such quantities in any of the other material examined (with the exception of Mackintosh's pamphlet, which puts forward an opposing argument). For example, Paine's Rights includes only 4 examples in 16,204 words, and there are only 2 instances in the full 10,756 words of Price's Add.Observ. This distinctive usage indicates at least a common interest in the pamphlets in question and Godwin's known pamphlets, and is most noticeable in reading the material as well as from the vocabulary analysis, so may be taken as additional evidence in favour of a common authorship. Second, there is a strongly related phrase in Law and Reflexions, which suggests that the author of the latter at least had seen the former, and which, added to the accumulating similarities, may also point to a common author. Though the reference to the imbecility of Henry VI is much more compact in Reflexions than in Law, both pamphlets contain a strikingly similar phrase in relation to the monarchy when describing the same case: "as to render him incapable of maintaining even the appearance of royal authority" ( Law ) "when Henry was no longer capable of maintaining the appearance of royalty" ( Reflexions ). Third, the introductory phrase "Let it be," as in "Let it be remembered"/ "supposed"/"considered," is found only in Godwin's writings and the two pamphlets in question, apart from Mackintosh's Arguments (which addresses the same concerns as Law from a different viewpoint). While the phrase "Let it be" might be assumed to be a common rhetorical device of the time, its presence across the Godwin material and its absence from most of the other works examined offers further evidence in support of Godwin's authorship of both Law and Reflexions. Finally, phrasal analysis revealed the following construction, which again is found only in the three pamphlets indicated: "thought proper to summon" ( Law ) "thought proper to prepare" ( Reflexions ) "thought proper to bring" ( Strictures ). Taken together, these examples offer considerable support for an identification of Godwin as the author of both Law and Reflexions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusions Godwin has been identified as having a distinctive style in the materials examined, which cover much of his writing life. The two main features of his style are that he generally has a much higher lexical richness score than any of the other writers analyzed, and that he makes much less use of the core vocabulary than many of his contemporaries. Of the two pamphlets in question , Reflexions sits within the boundaries of Godwin's other writings in all the charts and in all examinations provides positive indications that he is the likely author. Investigation of the pamphlets of other writers at the time certainly offers no other candidate. This is significant, since the external evidence for the authorship of Reflexions is the weaker of the two pamphlets under consideration. The focus of this examination has been Law because it is the better attested of the two pamphlets, yet it appeared to be outside the boundary of Godwin material in one crucial respect, that of lexical richness . However, further analysis revealed that Law sits well within the norms for Godwin's use of the core vocabulary and shares with Reflexions very similar use or non-use of marker functional vocabulary, and that lexical vocabulary is present at the phrasal level linking Godwin's known work with both Law and Reflexions. The low lexical richness score has been identified as having its source in the unusually high level of repetition contained in the central portion of the pamphlet, which is a function of the way the author has chosen to lay out the argument. This authorial decision has greatly reduced the amount of vocabulary items relative to the length of text, not only in respect of Godwin's work, but also in relation to what would be expected in any text of a similar length. This means that the statistical scores, without the large historical segments and the regular references to parliamentary procedures, could be expected to be more like Defence and Strictures. In the light of all these factors, it is our opinion that there is sufficient internal evidence from this investigation to support the contemporary manuscript ascriptions and the related evidence in Godwin's diary, and to attribute authorship of both anonymous pamphlets to Godwin. These two pamphlets on the Regency Crisis are important additions to the canon of Godwin's works. 13 They are significant for what they reveal about both his developing political views and his consistent resourcefulness as a pamphlet writer. They demonstrate that his practical engagement with contemporary British politics did not lessen towards the end of the 1780s, as is often thought, but that he continued to support the Foxite Whigs right up to the spring of 1789. At the same time, they indicate just how much Godwin was preoccupied with constitutional questions on the eve of the French Revolution, two years before he began writing Enquiry. Finally, Godwin's Regency pamphlets, in their mixture of abstract speculation and engagement with concrete political questions, adumbrate a central feature of his thought as it developed through the 1790s, and beyond. As experiments in combining speculative and practical politics, Law and Reflexions help to explain how Godwin became the author of not only Enquiry but also Strictures, his most successful intervention in contemporary politics, in which he demolished the government's case of high treason brought against twelve leading radicals in 1794.</field>

F. 2/5. Both pamphlets under discussion are contained in a volume of ten tracts, entitled "Pamphlets concerning King's Illness 1788-89." The volume includes a manuscript contents list in an unidentified late eighteenth-century or early nineteenth-century hand, headed "S. S. S. 7." Before rebacking in 1998, the spine had a fragment of a label bearing the same number, which suggests that the volume was originally part of a large pamphlet collection or that this is the pressmark of a private library. The volume also has a nineteenth-century ownership inscription, "James Weale." The pressmark on the spine, "LVII | F | 2," indicates that it forms part of the library of Martin Joseph Routh (1755-1854), the great patristics scholar, whose collection of printed books passed on his death to the University of Durham. The hand in which the authorship ascriptions of the two pamphlets in question are written does not occur elsewhere in the volume and is not that of Routh himself. A review of copies of each pamphlet in other libraries found no other evidence of authorship attributions. 2 Godwin, diary, Abinger Manuscripts, Dep. e. 196, fol. 20r. 3 Monthly Review, 80 (March 1789), 275.

This represents the only instance where part of a text was used. 10 Godwin noted dining with Towers for the first time on 7 October 1788; Lofft's name appears on a list of acquaintances made in 1788 at the back of the seventh volume of his diary (Abinger Manuscripts, Dep. e. 196, fol. 16r; Dep. e. 202, fol. 47r). 11 For an examination of the shared vocabulary characteristics of eighteenth-century Dissenting sermons, including works by Towers, see Deconinck-Brossard. 12 CopyCatch is a collusion and plagiarism detection program developed by David Woolls and is commercially available from CFL Software Development, UK. 13 For an edition of the two pamphlets, together with a fuller discussion of the material summarized in this paragraph, see Pamela Clemit, "Two Pamphlets on the Regency Crisis by William Godwin," Enlightenment and Dissent 20 (2001) (forthcoming).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THOMAS HOWES' CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS (1776-1807) AND HIS DISPUTE WITH JOSEPH PRIESTLEY by David Chandler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Howes ' Critical Observations on Books, Antient and Modern (1776-1807), published by Benjamin White, is an early example of the single-authored scholarly journal. 1 Howes combined the serious and scholarly elements of such monthly miscellanies as the Gentleman's Magazine (founded 1731) with the taste for expert reviewing established by the Monthly Review (founded 1749) and its rivals. Critical Observations (hereafter CO ) was largely ignored in its own time, when contemporary reviewing periodicals considered it a rival work, and has been overlooked by later scholars of eighteenth-century periodical publication, not recognised, or accepted, as a periodical at all. It merits reappraisal for its intriguing genre and the esteem in which it was held: Samuel Parr was prepared to place CO "in the highest class of literary publications." 2 The recent renaissance of interest in Joseph Priestley should also recall attention to Howes, Priestley's main opponent (after Samuel Horsley) in the celebrated Unitarian disputes of the 1780s. As documented here, Howes' contributions to that controversy were incorporated into CO. CO presents a daunting bibliographical problem. Almost all surviving copies are incomplete, sometimes wrongly bound, and library copies have often been catalogued incorrectly. The object of the present article is to describe a complete set as originally published (i.e. before title pages of the individual numbers may have been discarded when the parts were bound into volumes) and how it came to assume this shape. It is hoped this will clarify the problems of gaps, sequence, and apparent suspension in midarticle in surviving copies, while also giving a brief overview of Howes' critical project and dispute with Priestley. The main points are summarised on the appended chart. "Number I" of CO (1776), pp. 1-97, concluding with a blank verso, was miscellaneous in nature, examining recent Homeric criticism and several historical works concerned with "the State of Scotland under the Romans" (80). It provides a useful insight into Howes' original conception of his work. "Number II" (1777), pp. 99-198, followed by two unnumbered pages of "Errata and Corrections," was superficially a review of recent scholarship respecting ancient chronology, but was more broadly synthetic and announced the problem which Howes was from now on principally concerned with: "until some more fixed and indubitable standard of prophane chronology shall be established, it is impossible to judge how far the dates in scripture do or do not accord to truth" (106). Neither of these numbers bear any reference to their being parts of a volume, though consecutive pagination obviously left that option open. The bibliographical problems begin with "Number III" (1778), again concerned with ancient chronology. An article listed on the title page—"Conjectures concerning the Meaning of the Word VENTA in British Names . . . [etc.]"—is not included in the number's consecutive pagination, pp. 201-272. Another curiosity of "Number III" is that it ends in mid-article. "Number IV" (1779) commences with the remainder of this article, and lists two articles on the title page not included in the consecutive pagination, 3 which extends through pp. 273-336: Remarks on the Translation of a Passage in Ibn Younes by Mr. Costard . . . [etc.] Remarks on Mr. Richardson's Dissertation on the Literature of Eastern Nations. The consecutive pagination of "Number V" (1780), the first number to read " Vol. I." in the direction line, extends through pp. 337-356 and concludes with two pages of "Corrections in the First Volume." Again the title page lists two articles not included in that numbering: The Histories of Ezra and Nehemiah vindicated against Josephus, the Jewish Chronicles . . . [etc.] Doubts concerning the Translation and Notes of the Bishop of London to the Five first Chapters of Isaiah. A clue to what had happened is supplied by the title page to volume two (the only title page issued for any of the volumes), which is dated 1783, and includes the following list of articles: Conjectures concerning the Meaning of the Word Venta . . . [etc.] Remarks on the Translation of a Passage . . . in Ibn. Younes's History of Celestial Observations. Remarks on Mr. Richardson's Dissertation on the Literature of Eastern Nations . . . [etc.] Doubts concerning the Translation and Notes of the Bishop of London to Isaiah, vindicating Ezechiel [ sic ], Isaiah, and other Jewish Prophets from Disorder in Arrangement. What is odd about this list is that "Doubts . . . ," while seeming to be just another article, actually serves as a general title for three entire numbers of CO: "Number VI" (1781), pp. 127-219 (with final blank verso), 4 "Number VII" (1782), pp. 221-318, and "Number VIII" (1783), pp. 319-449 (with final unnumbered verso containing "Corrections," concluding the volume), all concerned with aspects of ancient chronology. The articles listed on the individual title pages of these numbers should all, apparently, be read as subsections of "Doubts" (which they essentially are). It is noteworthy that "Number VI" listed, as its first article, "Doubts": this title (with slight variations 5 ) thus appears on "Number V" (1780), "Number VI" (1781), and the volume two title page (1783). In the first case it seems to refer to a single short article, but in the last case it refers to a whole series of articles. " Number VI" clearly begins with the second article listed on the title page ("The Titles to Isaiah and the other Prophets, writ by themselves . . . [etc.]"), so it seems that here too Howes intended "Doubts" as a sort of general title, even though it is not differentiated from the remainder of the contents list. Perhaps he was already considering this the easiest way of simplifying the volume's contents. The first three articles enumerated on the title page of volume two, those which had been previously listed as part of "Number III" and "Number IV," extend over pp. 1-104. They are followed by a series of "Additions and Corrections in the Second Volume" (relating to the first 104 pages), pp. 105-108, and an article entitled "Doubts," as on the "Number V" title page, pp. 109126 . "The Histories of Ezra and Nehemiah vindicated . . . ," announced on the "Number V" title page, was in the event incorporated into the "Remarks on Mr. Richardson's Dissertation." The absence of catchwords on pages 22 and 104 suggests that pp. 1-126 were printed in three parts: the " Conjectures ," pp. 1-22, the two sets of "Remarks," pp. 23-104, and the "Additions" and "Doubts," pp. 109-126. All three parts carry " Vol. II." in the direction line. At first sight it would seem fair to conclude that the title pages for " Numbers III-V" accurately describe the published units. If so, the contents of these numbers would be represented thus: Vol. 1 Vol. 2 Page Length Number III 201-272 1-22 94 Number IV 273-336 23-104 146 Number V 337-356 105-126 42 The very disproportionate lengths of "Number IV" and "Number V" creates some unease, however, and it is possible that pp. 23-104 of volume two was divided, and that what was issued as "Number IV" actually concluded in mid-sentence. There is, in particular, the strange circumstance, mentioned above, that "Number V" announced an article which had-on the above model—already been absorbed into an article in "Number IV." British Library copy 72.e.19-22, moreover, has the title page for "Number V" bound after page 52 of volume two, where it seems oddly placed, especially as other title pages in this copy are placed where we would expect to find them. It is at this point, though, that Howes does start to discuss Josephus. If he was compelled to break off "Number IV" in mid-sentence here the numbers would be of equal length, in fact: 94 pages each. The reason for this odd publishing arrangement seems to have been a late decision on Howes' part to make his periodical into an organised and systematic part-work. It was in "Number III," significantly, that he stated "I shall hereafter pay less attention to the mistakes of others, and confine myself more to the mere investigation of truth . . . " (204). Howes sent the printer the various numbers in installments: "In such periodical publications as these of my Critical Observations, the first part of each number . . . is generally printed off before the last part is committed to paper," he later noted. 6 It is probable, then, that while he was working on "Number III" he decided to make the "Conjectures concerning . . . the Word VENTA" part of the second volume, so as to preserve a connected study of the chronology question . Presumably he reasoned that as volume one had begun with miscellaneous material, volume two could as well. A plan for a two-volume work (at least), both volumes starting with miscellaneous material before focussing on issues of ancient chronology, can thus be reasonably dated to 1778. At the end of the troublesome reorganisation in "Numbers II-V" Howes felt that CO had been successfully transformed. "Number V" accordingly included a sort of retrospective prospectus. Howes' "principal subject," he now clarified, would be to explain "doubtful and contested passages in the Jewish Scriptures by means of a more accurate system of prophane chronology," but he would also examine "into a variety of other inferior subjects . . . the several parts together assist in forming the whole into one connected and consistent body of truths" (110-111). In the years 1781-83 CO certainly had its most "connected and consistent" shape, but such recondite researches inevitably had a small public, and when Joseph Priestley started a major controversy over the theological tenets of the early church with his History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1782), Howes recognised a better arena in which to display his scholarship. The publishing history of CO was consequently thrown into disarray again. On 23 June 1784 Howes preached in Norwich Cathedral at the primary visitation of the Bishop of Norwich, Lewis Bagot. At "the request of the Clergy" his sermon was published soon afterwards as A Discourse on the Abuse of the Talent of Disputation in Religion, Particularly as practiced by Dr. Priestly [ sic ], Mr. Gibbon, And others of the modern Sect of Philosophic Christians by J. and C. Berry of Norwich. The published sermon makes no reference to Gibbon, but includes incidental criticism of Priestley's History. Against Priestley, Howes stated, with brief support, "[not] one Christian sect whatever of the first ages, ever held any such opinion as the mere humanity of Christ . . . that is, as if humanity extended throughout the whole life of Jesus" (13-14). In a note he added: "The evidence on which the above assertions are made will be collected more at large in the 4th vol. of Critical Observations on books antient and modern " (15). Samuel Parr submitted an approving review of the Discourse, gratis, to the Monthly Review, which was published in October. He carefully avoided a comment on the correctness or otherwise of Howes' account of the early Christian sects, 7 but took the opportunity of including an advertisement for CO: As this work is in some measure a Review, the contents of it do not fall properly within our notice. We are happy, however, in this opportunity of informing our Readers, that for acuteness of reasoning, and depth of erudition, the criticisms of Mr. Howes deserve to be ranked in the highest class of literary publications. 8 The only clue to the Discourse being a part of CO was the inclusion of " Vol. III" in the direction line. It was certainly issued as a separate work by Berry, so Howes seems to have been intent on killing the proverbial two birds with one stone, publishing his sermon to oblige the Norwich clergy while also ensuring that White had something to offer subscribers to CO. 9 It can be supposed that having worked on the Unitarian question in 1783-84 he had no other new material for the 1784 number of CO. In other respects the decision to make the Discourse part of volume three is puzzling, for in terms of subject matter it would naturally have taken its place in the planned fourth volume on the Unitarian question. (That Howes, who clearly recognised the topicality of the Unitarian question, was not tempted to simply call this the third volume indicates his desire that CO be a structured whole.) However, Howes or White must have decided that to start publishing parts of volume four before any of volume three had appeared would be confusing for purchasers, and, as noted above, volumes one and two had established a precedent for beginning a volume with miscellaneous materials. There is no suggestion in surviving copies that purchasers of the Discourse from White in 1784 received any sort of covering page announcing its identity as part of CO. It was probably late in 1785 that an (undated) title page for "Number IX" of CO was issued, explaining how the Discourse would fit into the work as a whole: VOL. III. An Introductory Discourse on the Abuse of the Talent of Disputation in Religion . . . [etc.] Researches concerning Chronology, continued, being an Enquiry into the Duration of the probable Age in Asiatic History . . . [etc.] VOL. IV. A Preface to the 4th Volume, containing an Examination of Dr. Priestley's Remarks on my Discourse. Remarks in Vindication of Justin, Epiphanius, and other Christian Fathers from the Mistakes or Misrepresentations of modern metaphysical Reformers of Christianity . . . [etc.] This title page was misleading in its implication that "Number IX" was going to be stretched over two full volumes, embracing two quite different types of material. Howes had, in fact, only a rough idea of what was going into his third volume (not completed until 1807), and this title page was clearly issued with a view to stalling his chronological "observations" so that he could continue with his researches on the Unitarian question, to be included in volume four. In fact this title page gives very little clue to the eventual shape of these two volumes. Retrospectively it becomes apparent that "Number IX" only embraced the Discourse, in volume three, and the " Preface " (pp. i-xv) and "Remarks in Vindication of Justin [etc.]" (pp. 1-88) in volume four. The latter were published late in 1785. The date is confirmed by a subsequent statement of Howes', 10 and is made more exact by the fact that the "Preface" responds to Priestley's Importance and Extent of Free Inquiry in Matters of Religion: A Sermon, not published until NovemberDecember that year. Priestley had just obtained a copy of Howes' Discourse (which he had known earlier by repute), and made some provocative remarks on it. At this point, it would appear, Howes' "Remarks"—dealing with Priestley's History of the Corruptions and the first two parts of his Letters to Dr. Horsley (1783-84)—had been "printed off." The hastily written "Preface" was then added, in a notably less courteous tone accusing Priestley of deliberate misconstruction in his Importance . . . of Free Inquiry. The " Remarks " set out Howes' ambitions modestly; he did not wish to go over ground already covered by Samuel Horsley, Priestley's principal theological opponent since 1783. He promised a further article "relative to the tenets of the Ebionites " (10). Obviously the title page to "Number IX" cannot have been printed earlier than the "Preface," and it was probably issued with it. At the bottom of this title page was added: "Sold by B. White, Fleet-Street. / Where may be had any single Number of the first Two Volumes, and those, who have purchased the above Introductory Discourse, may have the remainder of this Number separate." This confirms the fact that "Number IX" was meant to be understood as published in two installments. Howes probably realised that the Discourse, just 36 pages long, could not claim to be an independent number, but, as suggested above, wanted to ensure that regular subscribers to CO received some part of the work in 1784. Priestly responded to Howes in June 1786, in his Letters to Dr. Horsley Part III . . . To which are added strictures on Mr. Howe's [ sic ] ninth number of Observations on books ancient and modern, pp. 56-64. His dispute with Horsley had now run its course, and the Letters sought to lure Howes into the role of Priestley's principal Trinitarian adversary: "In Mr. Howes I have a much more respectable, and a somewhat more temperate antagonist than the Archdeacon of St. Albans [i.e. Horsley]" (56). Priestley concluded his volume with the hope that Howes' efforts would hasten the demise of Trinitarianism: it is a particular satisfaction to me that this discussion is at length undertaken by Mr. Howes, who is unquestionably a scholar, and who is at the same time so expeditious in his motions; as we shall now see all that can be produced againt my argument, and the learned will not long be in suspense with respect to it. (64) Howes responded in "An Appendix to the Fourth Volume of Critical Observations on Books, Antient and Modern," published with no title page and no date, though dateable to February-May 1787. The "Appendix" makes a reference to "Mr. Parkhurst in his late excellent tract against Dr. Priestley" (112), that is John Parkhurst's The Divinity and Pre-Existence of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Demonstrated From Scripture (1787), listed in the Gentleman's Magazine as a "New Publication" for February. 11 By 29 May Priestley had seen the "Appendix." 12 The "Appendix" was issued with separate pagination (pp. 1-128) and was designed to woo new readers. It combined the promised article on the Ebionites with a review of Priestley's History of Early Opinions Concerning Jesus Christ (1786), a defensive preface stressing Howes' own informed impartiality, and a personal attack on Priestley . He later explained the circumstances attending the writing of the "Appendix" thus: I had intended to pursue a similar enquiry [to that in "Number IX"] with respect to the belief of all later Christian sectaries during the first two centuries. . . But I found my further progress interrupted by some observations of Dr. Priestley on the proofs, which I had already produced . . . in order therefore, that I might not intermix those two subjects promiscuously, I determined to suspend some additions and replies . . . and I threw it into the form of an Appendix . . . in order that it might be afterwards read agreeably according to the proper order of arrangement. . . 13 Priestley was, or affected to be, very unimpressed with Howes' " Appendix ." "A more peevish and ill-judged performance than Mr. Howes's I hardly ever saw. I shall be in no haste to reply . . . ," he wrote to Theophilus Lindsey on 29 May. He considered Howes' arguments "even more contemptible than those of Dr. Horsley." 14 However Priestley quickly published a letter in the Gentleman's Magazine for June 1787, stating that a reply to Howes was "ready for the press," but that he was delaying publication "as Mr. Howes intimates that he has more to produce, which he postpones for the present, and other learned works in defence of the Doctrine of the Trinity are expected , [and] I wish . . . to consider what they may all advance at the same time." 15 In his "Appendix" Howes had indeed promised further " Remarks on the Fathers " and "a proof or two, that not even among the orthodox any more than among the sectaries has any evidence been produced by Dr. Priestley , that the doctrine of Humanism had ever been known during the first two centuries" (126). He published nothing more in 1787, so Priestley included his "very severe" 16 "reply" in Defences of Unitarianism for the Year 1787 (1788), pp. 71-108. He was now openly contemptuous of Howes' scholarship , considering his adversary "entitled to no sort of respect." 17 Howes does appear to have felt worsted by Priestley, a position doubtless not softened by the popular Monthly Review reprinting a large extract of the latter's attack. 18 He seems to have lost some confidence in CO, and in the end the continuation of the " Remarks " did not appear until 1795, as " Number X," essentially completing the fourth volume. By this time the subject had lost its interest and Priestley had emigrated to America. In the interim Howes had made two desultory attempts to begin volume three. In 1788 "An Appendix to Vol. III" appeared, which necessarily had separate pagination (pp. 1-93, with a final unnumbered page of "Corrections"). The opening remarks made it clear that this was appearing before the main body of the volume, as an astronomical tool enabling readers "to form some Judgement for themselves of the truth of [Howes'] computations" (2). That Howes was smarting from Priestley's attacks in 1786 and 1788 is clear from the incorporation of a series of sarcasms directed at Priestley into this unlikely context (pp. 24-25, 45-47, 52, 72-73, 77-78, 81, 86, 89). Howes was now attempting to establish Priestley as the type of the bad, rash scholar. In 1791 Howes stalled CO again with some overlong "Illustrations of the Appendix to Volume Three" (pp. 95-269, with a final unnumbered page of "Errata"): "the present Illustrations are intended to supply such information as may still be wanting concerning some subjects in the Appendix to Vol. 3, and to explain and prove in others the truth and accuracy of various assertions to be found there" (96). Howes again included a series of incidental attacks on Priestley's scholarship (pp. 141, 148, 161, 167-169, 171, 177, 245-246, 263264) , and in a final note picked up the old dispute. In his Defences of Unitarianism for the Years 1788 &amp; 1789 (1790) Priestley had claimed to have waited in vain for the re-appearance of three other of my antagonists, viz. Mr. Howes, Dr. Geddes, and the Dean of Canterbury. But as they have been sufficiently urged to produce every thing that they had to allege, and they have all had sufficient time for the purpose, I must conclude that inclination is wanting. Whether this want of inclination , has arisen from any consciousness of a want of ability to fulfil their engagements to the Public, must be left to the conjecture of our common readers. (ix) Howes responded by stating: The real fact is, that I have already, in my Appendix to vol. 4, performed all that I have ever engaged for, namely, to support, with evidence, what I had advanced in my Discourse, i.e. that both the Ebionites and all other sectaries of the first two centuries, were believers in the subordinate divinity of the Christ . . . As to any hints given by me of extending my views farther, they were only hints, which however I have not relinquished, but hitherto these other subjects have engaged all my time . . . I shall never have inclination to sacrifice the plan of this work, so as to render it a mere vehicle of altercation with such writers, as manifest no other wish, than only to perplex and confound the reason of mankind with unsolid disputation, in order to give a plausible appearance to the prejudices of a religious party. (270) Parts of CO continued to appear, but at long intervals. Howes was now an old man. As noted already, "Number X" appeared in 1795, essentially completing volume four (pp. 89-198). It was entirely taken up with the " suspended subject . . . of Jewish theology, " and Howes described it as "in addition to, in confirmation and defence of what I have already advanced upon the subject in my foregoing Remarks on the Fathers " (93). A note explained that its delayed appearance was "owing entirely to the intervention of other literary enquiries, together with avocations from ill health, domestic and worldly affairs" (93). "Number XI," finally extending the main body of the long-delayed volume three on chronological questions, appeared in 1800 (pp. 37-162). This began on a weary note: LIFE is too short, and the avocations in it too many for any individual to expect sufficient time and leisure to form a complete system in any science, more especially in such a complex subject as chronology . . . I shall therefore go on to include what has occurred to me on that subject under the general title of Observations only; intending no more than to point out to future compilers of chronologic systems some of the chief places, where their predecessors seem to have taken the wrong road. . . (37) Two further parts completed volume three, and Howes' chronological studies: "Number XII" of CO was published in 1805 (pp. 163-296), "Number XIII" in 1807 (pp. 297-430). A late addition to volume four was an undated "Illustrations of Various Subjects in the Preceding Four Volumes," pp. 129-152 (extending the 1787 appendix). These "Illustrations" refer only to "Numbers X-XI" (1795, 1800), which provides a terminus a quo respecting their date. They are cited, and in one case corrected, in "Number XIII" (pp. 348, 352, 375), which provides a terminus ad quem. It is probable, then, that they were issued with "Number XII." "Number XIII" announced that there would be yet further " Illustrations ," though in the end they do not appear to have been issued: "I have hitherto delayed bringing forward my Illustrations and Corrections of various articles in the preceding volumes . . . In those Illustrations I shall include answers to some criticisms made on parts of the preceding volumes. . . (307-308). The attached chart lists the various parts of CO chronologically and shows how the four volumes were constructed. Unnumbered pages of CO which incorporate text are recorded in square brackets.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Howes was born at Thorndon, Suffolk, where he was baptized on 19 October 1728 ( DNB erroneously gives his date of birth as 1729). By 1776 he was rector of Morningthorpe, Norfolk, and of Thorndon. He ordinarily resided in Norwhich, where he died in 1814. Little is known of his life. 2 Monthly Review 71 (1784), 319. 3 A third announced article, "Observations also on Herodotus, Ctesias, Diodorus . . . [etc.]," does not appear with a separate heading but seems to have been absorbed into a previous article, "The same Error of one Year in our Systems of Chronology." 4 Because of the confusing repetition of the title "Doubts . . ." on the title page of "Number VI," discussed below, it can be initially a little unclear where this number begins. It was undoubtedly at p. 127, however. The run of CO owned by Dr Williams's Library, London, conveniently starts with this number, and other copies preserve the title page of "Number VI" between pp. 126-127. Catchwords and signatures point to the same conclusion. 5 On the "Number VI" title page it appears as "Doubts concerning the Bishop of London's Translation and Notes to the First Five Chapters of Isaiah." 6 "Illustrations of the Appendix to Volume Three" (1791), 95. 7 Parr seems to have privately disagreed with Howes: The Works of Samuel Parr, LL.D, ed. John Johnstone, 8 vols (London, 1828), VIII, 192-193. 8 Monthly Review 71 (1784), 319. The Bodleian copy, which was that of its publisher, Ralph Griffiths, marks this as Parr's review. For the fact of its being a voluntary submission, see p. 400. 9 Parr's review gives as the publisher of the Discourse "Berry, Norwich." The Bodleian copy has the MS addition "White, London." 10 "Number X" (1795), 89. 11 Gentleman's Magazine 57 (1787), 168. 12 John Towill Rutt, Life and Correspondence of Joseph Priestley, 2 vols (London, 1831-32), I, 408; hereafter cited as Rutt. 13 "Number X" (1795), 91-92. 14 Rutt, I, 408. 15 Gentleman's Magazine 57 (1787), 462. 16 Rutt, I, 423. 17 Rutt, I, 409. 18 Monthly Review 78 (1788), 458-459. The Bodleian copy shows the reviewer of Priestley's Defences to have been William Enfield (1741-97), the de facto head of the Dissenters in Norwich, who was probably known to Howes. Enfield, who frequently criticised Priestley's love of disputation, here suggested that all parties should "retire" from "these fruitless inquiries" (459), a criticism which may have influenced Howes' subsequent silence.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF BYRON'S "TO THE PO" by Andrew M. Stauffer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Written in June of 1819 as Byron was falling uneasily in love with Theresa Guiccioli, "To the Po" provides one of our best examples of his late lyric mode, in which his passions are made tributary to clear-eyed surveys of the contradictions and limits of his life. The poem has long been thought to have first met the public eye in Thomas Medwin's Journal of the Conversations of the Lord Byron, published on October 23, 1824. 1 Certainly, Medwin was the instrument by which "To the Po" was published and known; prior to McGann's edition of Byron, "all printed texts [could] be traced back to Medwin as their most important intermediate source" (CPW 4.497). A friend and frequent visitor of both Byron and Shelley in 1821 and 1822, Medwin was well-placed to secure a copy of this particular poem; textual evidence indicates that he transcribed it from a manuscript copy that Mary Shelley executed in 1819. However, the poem in fact appeared in print just prior to its publication in the Conversations, in the premier issue of a literary journal entitled the Attic Miscellany, accompanying a preview of Medwin's work. 2 This version of the poem offers another window on the lost Medwin transcript. The poem Byron himself called "To the Po" was first published as "ORIGINAL VERSES BY LORD BYRON: / Addressed to the Countess Guiccioli. / (From Capt. Medwin's Work.)" in the October (and indeed, the only) number of the Attic Miscellany, an abortive journal issued under the sponsorship of Thomas Colley Grattan, Henry Bulwer and Charles Sheridan, and edited by a Mr. Forbes. 3 Grattan had served as Medwin's literary agent in the placement of the Journal of the Conversations with publisher Henry Colburn, 4 who allowed Grattan to publish extracts in advance. As Grattan describes the transaction, I put Colburn in communication with Mr. Forbes, the editor of `The Attic Miscellany ' and entrusted [him] with the care of its publication, leaving to that gentleman , on his being furnished with the proof-sheets, the choice of the passages from Medwin, and undertaking myself to write the article which was to introduce them. ( Beaten Paths, 2:63) Furthermore, Grattan writes in the introductory article in the Miscellany, the MS. in question [i.e., Medwin's Journal ] was put into our hands, with the amplest liberty of selection for our present purpose. Sensible of the advantage thus offered to us, we did not abuse the confidence. . . . Our chief object in taking enough to enrich our own work, was to give the public a specimen of the ample treat which they will so shortly be able to enjoy. (29) These extracts were printed as part of "Article IV" in the Miscellany, entitled "LORD BYRON AND HIS MEMOIRS. / Including Facts and Opinions as detailed by himself in authentic and / original Conversations with a Friend, upon the most interesting / Circumstances of his Life, his Contemporaries, and the Literature of / the present Day. / (Extracted from a Work now in the Press)," which occupies pages 26-37 of the issue. The "Original Verses" (i.e., "To the Po") appear separately on pages 136-137, between Articles XIV and XV. In order to place this Attic Miscellany printing in context, we need to review briefly the textual history of "To the Po." We have a number of relevant manuscripts: Byron's original draft manuscript ( MS. Mo ), two transcripts of that draft by Mary Shelley ( MSS. A and P ), Byron's revised fair copy ( MS. B ), and a later (1827-29) transcript of MS. P made by Theresa Guiccioli ( MS. G ). The only relevant printed texts are those in the Miscellany and the Conversations; they derive directly from Medwin's transcript. McGann has determined that Medwin made his copy from Mary Shelley's MS. A (the earlier of her two transcripts), given that the Conversations text shares its unique readings (but not those of any other ms.). The Miscellany text shares these as well, helping confirm McGann's conclusion. Indeed, both of Mary's copies— MS. A and MS. P —are quite similar, differing only at three substantive points: MS. A has "and" for "yet" in line 17, "that moment" for "this moment" in line 26, and "on" for "by" in line 35. Medwin's copy as published in both the Miscellany and the Conversations does follow MS. A precisely at these three points, and thus most likely derived from it. 5 Despite Grattan's assumption that Colburn would deliver proof-sheets of Medwin's work to the Attic Miscellany editors, Forbes and his typesetters were evidently working from Medwin's holograph manuscript itself, given the variants introduced there in the poem (and in the extracts as well). 6 This is significant in that the Miscellany text offers another partial view of Medwin's now-lost manuscript transcription of "To the Po." We know that the notoriously inaccurate Medwin produced a corrupt version of MS. A, not only through carelessness but by `improving' the poem in small ways as he copied. In both the Miscellany and Conversations printings of his manuscript, we find some thirteen substantive variants from MS. A. These can be observed in the following table, where differences in punctuation have not been recorded: Stanza Line MS.A Miscellany Conversations 1 3 thy brink the brink the brink 4 13 have somewhat somewhat have have somewhat 5 17 behind us behind us behind them 5 19 wildly wildly onward wildly onward 6 23 will look shall look will look 6 24 unchained from unharmed from unharm'd by 7 27 name, hear named or see name, nor name and see dream of, name or see 7 28 inseparable inseparable inseparable 8 29 on thy in thy in thy 8 32 it's flow a flow its flow 9 35 thy bank thy banks thy banks 9 36 the source the source thy source 9 36 blue deep dark-blue deep dark-blue deep 10 39 distractions distraction distraction 11 40 Ah! various As various As various 14 52 cannot be moved can ne'er be moved can ne'er be moved This collation shows that each printing of Medwin's copy of MS.A produced a different array of error. Forbes's version of the Medwin transcription (in the Miscellany ) adheres to MS. A slightly more closely than does Colburn's version of it (in the Conversations ): in lines 17, 24, 27, and 36, the Miscellany text follows MS. A where Conversations departs from it. However, in lines 13, 23, and 32 the opposite holds true; Conversations is closer to MS. A at these points. These conflicting errors suggest that Medwin's transcription— already corrupt at a number of points (e.g. 19, 36, 52)—was also difficult to decipher. Lines 24 and 27 in particular show the Miscellany editors reading more carefully than Colburn did, and yet still making mistakes: "unchained" looked like "unharmed" and the sequence "name, here named, or see" was difficult to make out for both editors. Ultimately, as McGann has shown, Byron would have favored neither published version, as he produced a revised text in April of 1820 ( MS. B ). 7 However, as the first text of the poem to be published, the Attic Miscellany version has priority in our conception of "To the Po" as part of Byron's printed legacy to post-Romantic England. The terms of its existence also help to fill out our picture of the publication and reception histories of Medwin's Conversations, a book of literary gossip that contributed heavily to the Victorian perception of Byron's personality, and to the biographical pursuit of the poet in general. Thanks to Medwin, "To the Po" itself comes to us as a record of one of Byron's personal romantic involvements—as do so many of his poems, early and late. In publishing "To the Po" in the midst of Byron's conversations, Medwin enacts an editorial theory that respects the deep connections of poetry and biography for readers of Byron. The Attic Miscellany extracts offer more evidence of how this Medwinian method of presenting Byron found its way to a public hungry for more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Byron's principal twentieth-century editors, E. H. Coleridge (in The Works of Lord Byron [London: John Murray, 1901], 4:545-547) and Jerome J. McGann (in Byron: The Complete Poetical Works [hereafter CPW], 7 vols. [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1980-1993], 4:210212 , and 496-497n333) agree on this point. For a summary of the circumstances surrounding the composition and publication of the Medwin volume, see Lovell's Captain Medwin: Friend of Byron and Shelley (Austin: UT Press, 1962), especially chapters 5 and 6. See also Lovell's edition of Medwin's text, Conversations of Lord Byron (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1966). 2 The poem also appeared simultaneously with the Journal of the Conversations in the October 23rd issue (No. 405) of The Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, and Sciences, &amp;c. (684). However, this text is taken directly from the first edition of the Journal so has little bibliographical significance. The Literary Gazette did review the Attic Miscellany in its previous issue (October 16; 657-660), and reprinted many of the extracts. Therefore, the Attic Miscellany text was known to them; it must have been published by the middle of October. 3 For more on the journal, see T. C. Grattan's Beaten Paths; and Those Who Trod Them, 2 vols. (London: Chapman and Hall, 1865), 2:62ff. No other issues appeared beyond this initial one, despite puffing reviews in The Literary Gazette (No. 404; Oct. 16, 1824, 657-660) and The Examiner (No. 872; Oct. 17, 1824, 665-666) and continued advertisements for it in The Examiner (No. 873; Oct. 24, 1824, 688); (No. 876; Nov. 14, 1824, 734). 4 In addition to Grattan's Beaten Paths, 2:62-63, see Lovell's Captain Medwin, 170ff., for the details of this transaction. 5 See Paula Feldman and Diana Scott-Kilvert's edition of the Journals of Mary Shelley, 1814-1844 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987), 383-401 passim. 6 A companion article to this one, "Byron, Medwin, and the False Fiend: Remembering `Remember Thee,' " examines the variants introduced in the Attic Miscellany texts of Byron's brief lyric "Remember Thee" and its accompanying anecdotes regarding Lady Caroline Lamb. Medwin and/or Colburn chose to eliminate some of the more inflammatory material from the published Journal, despite its earlier appearance in the Miscellany.

      <field name="heading_text">JOSEPH CONRAD'S UNDER WESTERN EYES: THE SERIALS AND FIRST EDITIONS by Roger Osborne</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joseph conard 's Under Western Eyes was published in London by Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. on 5 October 1911 and in New York on 19 October 1911 by Harper and Brothers. Versions of the novel had been appearing monthly in serial form in the English Review and the North American Review since December 1910, but extant correspondence suggests that Conrad was most concerned about the book form of the novel, especially Methuen's first English edition. As early as July 1910 Conrad had proclaimed that "The book publication will be from the text as established in the English Review " ( Letters, 4, 353), revealing a plan for the transmission of text that centred on revision and correction before the publication of the English Review serial. 1 But on 25 November 1911 he told Warrington Dawson that he was "having a row with Methuen about certain matters connected with the publication of that miserable novel" ( Letters, 4, 511). Conrad recalled these matters in March 1913 when he wrote to his agent, James Pinker, about "the beastly muddle with the Western Eyes proofs" ( Letters, 5, 188). His disappointment with this "beastly muddle" suggests that Conrad's preparation for the book publication of Under Western Eyes was complicated by "the Western Eyes proofs". Comparison of the two serials and the two first book editions shows that Conrad's preoccupation with English publication subsequently caused the American versions of Under Western Eyes to differ substantially from the English versions . This occurred because he used several sets of English Review pages and proofs to transmit his corrections and revisions. This method of transmission also produced a number of anomalies in the English texts, resulting in the publication of a collection of texts with questionable authority in relation to Joseph Conrad's intentions, final or otherwise. The following discussion of the transmission of Under Western Eyes from typescript to first edition demonstrates how much instability lies behind the printed text familiar to most readers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. The Typescripts of Under Western Eyes The following discussion of the transmission of the text of Under Western Eyes addresses the period following Conrad's revision of the extant typescript. The typescript (TS) is an 843-page document that accumulated between October 1908 and January 1910. 2 The tale was first conceived as a short story called "Razumov" in December 1907, but it continued to evolve as Conrad explored the personal themes contained in the narrative. Despite repeated insistences that the composition was at a penultimate stage, Conrad continued to add to the narrative throughout the first eight months of 1908 until a 288page clean typed copy was prepared (from the messy typed copy that had accumulated to that point) in September and October 1908 by Conrad's occasional secretary, Lillian Hallowes. In October 1908, Conrad insisted that "Razumov" would be a seven- or eight-chapter novel, requiring only a short period of time for completion. But this did not occur and the narrative continued to expand. The typing of these 288 pages ended a difficult ten months of composition and revision, and the beginning of a further fifteen months of composition before Conrad suffered a nervous breakdown at the end of January 1910. Throughout 1909 Conrad continued to expand the story, adding almost five hundred pages of typescript to the growing pile. The typescript from this period is clearly divided into batches that match batches of the extant manuscript (MS), indicating that TS grew alongside MS as Conrad completed batches of manuscript and sent them for typing (Osborne, 2000, 212-214). The typescript batches following the first 312 pages are unnumbered and were held together with brads before they were arranged and labelled A-T in April 1910. The last batches of typed copy were probably forwarded to Conrad soon after he declared the novel complete on 26 January 1910. But the stress caused by his ¥2700 debt to Pinker, his immersion in the personal narrative and the prospect that Under Western Eyes would not make enough money to erase his debt brought on a complete nervous breakdown at the end of January 1910. 3 Conrad did not touch TS again until the end of March 1910. Having sufficiently recovered from the breakdown to be able to work, he returned to the typescript afresh. In April and May 1910 he clearly marked part and chapter divisions for the first time, then cut large sections of text from this new arrangement with blue pencil before revising the remaining pages with grey pencil. These revisions added two more levels of revision to the occasional ink revisions executed during composition. It is difficult to describe Conrad's motivations at this time with certainty, making these revisions an important transition in the growth of Under Western Eyes. Scholars have offered a number of explanations for the excision of such a large amount of material, including artistic, psychological and financial motivations. However, the ambiguity of Conrad's extant correspondence inhibits our complete understanding of this period. There is no concrete indication that he intended later to restore text he had cut from TS, but Conrad's apparent acceptance of the new text should not consign the discarded sections to the workshop floor. 4 A clean typed copy of TS was organised and corrected by Conrad's lawyer, Robert Garnett. 5 This non-extant typed copy (and probably a carbon copy) then served as the setting copies for the serialisation of Under Western Eyes in the North American Review and the English Review. While there is no evidence to prove a carbon copy was made, Conrad's practice in previous years suggests that the new text of Under Western Eyes existed in at least two copies with Garnett's corrections imposed on those pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Under Western Eyes in the North American Review Although James Pinker had probably been communicating with Colonel George Harvey since 1909, Harvey's magazine, the North American Review, was not mentioned in direct relation to Under Western Eyes until October 1910. Conrad probably sent, via Pinker, one copy of the typescript arranged and corrected by Robert Garnett. On 1 October Conrad wrote to Pinker, "I trust you will be able to conclude with the N. A. R. but its a very small review—I mean in point of size" ( Letters, 4, 372). 6 From this day, the American serialisation is not mentioned again in Conrad's extant correspondence. 7 The text of Under Western Eyes found in the North American Review is the closest of the four published versions to the final text of TS. This suggests that the variation in the text of the North American Review reveals many of the corrections made by Robert Garnett in May 1910 or changes imposed by an editor or compositor during serialisation. Many of the changes are spelling corrections and can be attributed to a typesetter, but some implement minor stylistic changes. For example, Mr de P— "addressed them repeatedly" (TS11) in TS, but this was changed to "addressed the people repeatedly" for the American magazine. In TS, Razumov stopped thinking of killing Haldin because "The corpse would hang round his neck nearly as fatal as a living man" (TS47). The magazine text reads, "The corpse hanging round his neck would be nearly as fatal as the living man". Comparison of the texts reveals many similar transpositions that have insignificant effect on the meaning of a sentence, but do affect the rhythm. Distinct changes are found as well, such as "unsubtle example" (TS38) to "obvious example"; "unenergetic" (TS109) to "listless"; "interests" (TS178) to "purposes"; but many of these changes appear to reflect someone following Conrad's request to "correct" the text—that is, someone who believed they had the authority to do so. This points to Robert Garnett. He can probably be connected to many of the variants that are carried through to all published texts. 8 He contributed to the text of Under Western Eyes heavier punctuation than TS and a collection of subtle changes to sense and rhythm, some, or conceivably all, of which Conrad might have made himself had he read over the clean typescript in May 1910. There is no evidence, however, that he did so. 9 Many readings unique to the American serial can also be found, probably indicating the interventions of editors and compositors. 10 For example, "the spree" (TS24) is "a spree", "suspect" (TS30) is "a suspect" and "spoke-like" (TS44) is "spook like" only in the American serial. Small variations such as these can be found throughout the text of the North American Review. 11 But, in addition to these, several large variations between TS and the North American Review text appear in the final chapter of the novel. The following passages were omitted in the North American Review text, but retained in all other published states: He lived not "in the centre" but in the South. She described to me a little wooden two roomed house in the suburb of some very small town, with a yard overgrown with thistles. He was crippled, ill, getting weaker everyday, and Tekla his samaritan was tending him with complete devotion. There was nothing in that work to become disillusioned about. (TS18) And this story too I received without comment in my character of a mute witness of things Russian unrolling their eastern logic before my Western eyes. But I permitted myself a question. (TS22) These omissions were probably implemented by the compositor simply to keep the text of the end of the novel from flowing over to the next page. 12 But, most importantly, the absence of these passages in the American serial assists the reconstruction of the transmission of text when Harper and Brothers ' text is compared. 13 Because Harper and Brothers' text does not omit these passages and does not contain the many readings unique to the American serial, it is highly unlikely that the North American Review text was used as setting copy, during the urgency of August and September 1911. 14 Furthermore , because Harper and Brothers' text does not exhibit a return to TS punctuation, it is also highly unlikely that the typescript used by the North American Review was used as setting copy by Harper and Brothers. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. From the English Review to American and English First Book Editions Arrangements for the English serial publication of Under Western Eyes were made in July 1910, signalling the beginning of a new phase of correction and revision. On 26 July 1910, Conrad heard the news that the English Review had agreed to serialise Under Western Eyes ( Letters, 4, 351). On 31 July 1910, he wrote to Austin Harrison, the editor of the English Review: May I ask You to give instructions for a double set of slips to be forwarded to me when the time comes? The book publication will be from the text as established in the English Review. ( Letters, 4, 353) 16 No galley slips or typescript from this period are extant, making it impossible to identify with certainty the document Conrad revised for Methuen. However , as I demonstrate below, Conrad probably made most of his corrections and revisions on the galley proofs of the English Review serial. Pinker or Robert Garnett probably delivered a typed copy of TS with Garnett's corrections to the English Review, from which were set galley proofs of each month's instalment. The setting of the English Review text received little comment in Conrad's correspondence until May 1911, 17 but Conrad's first extant comments reveal a problem with his correction and revision. Conrad wrote to Pinker: It's done. I join to the type a corrected set of galley slips immediately preceeding the text in case it may come in useful. . . . I beg you most earnestly—if you can do so—to arrange for the English Rev. setting up slips from this corrected copy here. It will save me infinite trouble. I doubt too if I will be able to remember exactly the corrections I've just made. ( Letters, 4, 436) This letter suggests that, at this stage, Conrad was working on both typescript and galley slips and reveals the difficulty that he faced in preparing copy for the English Review. His distinction between "galley slips" and "type" and his request on 1 or 8 June 1911 that Pinker "send . . . back . . . corr d type when done for the purpose of clean copy" ( Letters, 4, 445) supports the idea that he was considering both typed pages and galley proofs. One can only speculate about the problem that was fixed by the procedure described in the letter above. But it seems most likely that Conrad conducted another layer of revision on a second set of galley proofs to repair some sort of damage caused by a setting error or accidental omission, influencing the exclamation, "It's done". Collation of all texts shows no extraordinary changes to patterns of transmission at this point, indicating that any problems were resolved on those pages of type and galley proof. Conrad probably had access to the typescript that was used as setting copy by the English Review (corresponding sections might have been returned with each instalment), but, as I argue below , it is more likely that Conrad's primary correction and revision centred on the galley proofs. Although the changes made between TS and the English Review cannot be attributed with certainty to either typescript or English Review galley proofs, several patterns of variation can be detected. When comparisons of TS and each published text are made, TS overwhelmingly agrees with the text of the North American Review against the English serial and two first editions. 18 This pattern demonstrates that most substantive changes were made on a document that transmitted text to all three publications. This occurred because published instalments and galley proofs of the English Review were used as setting copy for both book publications. Conrad did not at first expect this. He must have expected a copy of the Garnett typescript to be used. He added to the letter quoted in the previous paragraph, "will you request Methuens to send me proofs (in the usual way double set) in good time. I won't be hustled over that matter. I must have time to read them" ( Letters, 4, 436). Pinker saw little merit in this and apparently suggested that pages of the English Review should be used as setting copy for Methuen. This would obviate the need for Conrad to correct carefully Methuen's proofs. Conrad agreed and replied on 13 May 1911: I appreciate very much Your considerate suggestion in re proofs in the letter received this morning. I shall send you on Monday the text as published in the ER, torn out of the numbers and arranged for the printers. I wish Methuens to set up from that. There would be then no author's alterations—only corrections of misprints. . . . They can go on as far as it has appeared including June. And for the future I shall correct the 2 sets of Review proofs and send one to you for Methuen to go on setting up from. ( Letters, 4, 438-439) Conrad arranged the available published pages for Methuen up to the May instalment of the English Review which contained the third chapter of part three. From this point, Methuen's printer would have received a set of English Review galley proofs with corrections. Another set was delivered to the printer of the English Review. Conrad might have had the opportunity to revise the typescript arranged and corrected by Robert Garnett, but, if so, he said nothing about it in the extant letters. It is more likely that he corrected galley proofs. On 21 or 28 May 1911 Conrad expressed dismay at attending to the proofs of the English Review: "The proofs of the July ER are now hanging over my head. I wish I could reach the half of the book without interruption of mood—but that's impossible" ( Letters, 4, 443). This transmission might have proceeded without incident, but Conrad's decision to send another set of proofs to Harper and Brothers for setting copy began several cases of confusion and mishap. Accepting the merit of using pages of the English Review for setting copy, Conrad proposed that the same method be used for Harper and Brothers. He asked Pinker in May 1911, Can we possibly get a set of ER for Harpers to set up from? Would it cost too much? A small sacrifice would be worth while perhaps in view of the circumstances. This correcting puts me off other work for a day. Perhaps if that's practicable you would stop Harper's setting up till we can send them the R. They surely must have old copies of it on their side. And if they set from them they needn't send proofs here at all. Their own readers can look after mere misprints. ( Letters, 4, 438-439) There is no evidence to confirm that Harper and Brothers had begun to set up at this time, and, if they had, what document they were setting from. Clearly, some agreement had been reached regarding the publication of Under Western Eyes by Harper and Brothers, but no arrangements had yet been made to incorporate the corrections and revisions made for the English Review. Nevertheless, a letter Conrad wrote to Pinker on 15 May 1911 gives some indication of the status of the Harper and Brothers text at this point: "If the back N os of the ER can be obtained for Harpers I am prepared to pay for them myself by deduction from the first money due to me to any reasonable amount for indeed I wish to save myself the necessity of reading for Harpers, which would be a serious interruption" ( Letters, 4, 441). It is clear that Conrad was not concerned about the textual integrity of the first American edition, granting an editor or compositor limited control after delivery of proofs. However, for Conrad's new revisions and corrections to be transmitted efficiently, a document which incorporated these new readings was required. Conrad began preparing the American text soon after, but his extant correspondence does not specify what material text was used to transmit the changes. On 19 or 26 May 1911, he wrote to Pinker, I've forwarded You Harper's proofs—corr d —complete. . . . They extend into May N o of Review, all but 5pp. 19 Therefore only the N os from May (inclusive) onwards will have to be sent to the US. . . . Thanks to unexpected assistance of a friend 20 staying with us, the interruption to my current work was not serious. ( Letters, 4, 442) Although Conrad says "Harper's proofs" there is evidence to suggest he was using the phrase loosely and that he meant English Review proofs for Harper. Conrad's clear references to instalments of the English Review suggest that he probably used a third set of English Review proofs (presumably galleys which would not necessarily end where the May instalment ended) for the transmission of text to Harper and Brothers. This would have been the least expensive method of delivery available to Conrad, requiring only the arrangement of pages and transcription of changes that were made on the galley proofs sent to the English Review. 21 This scenario is supported by Conrad's letter to Pinker written at the end of May 1911: "I shall send you the dup te sheets without delay for Harpers" ( Letters, 4, 443). Most chapters of the first half of the novel strongly reflect the dominant agreement between the English Review and the two first book editions. The American first edition falls out of this pattern in the second half of the novel, suggesting a separate line of transmission to the two English publications. The three sets of published pages and galley proofs were the most likely site of most of the corrections and revisions that were incorporated in the texts of the English Review, Harper and Brothers and Methuen. Conrad's plan suggests that the transmission of text to Harper and Brothers would be very close to the transmission of the first English edition, but this did not eventuate. Because approximately 220 changes (the majority in the second half of the novel) were transmitted to the English Review (and subsequently to Methuen's text), but not to Harper and Brothers, a set of galley proofs with lighter, or no correction, is the most likely setting copy for most of the first American edition. Figure 1. Transmission of Under Western Eyes from the extant typescript. Text in square brackets indicates that the document is not extant. Conrad's work on the "proofs" for Harper receives more comment in correspondence than his work on proofs for the English Review and Methuen. In June, Conrad forwarded "the June N o " and "corrected slips of the July instalment for sending to America" ( Letters, 4, 445). On 27 June he suggested to Pinker that "If you will . . . kindly send the July N o and such proof-sheets as are not included in it to Harpers they shall have something to go on with", and insisted that once forthcoming galley slips of the English Review were in his hands he would "transmit them to [Pinker] for H's without delay" ( Letters, 4, 454). As this correspondence confirms, a mixture of galley slips and published pages of the English Review were sent to the American publisher as setting copy. The first American edition received a stream of copy from England that was at various stages of completion, and, as I demonstrate below, this produced a text that varies significantly from the English first edition because of Conrad's closer attention to the English texts. As the serialisation of Under Western Eyes neared its conclusion in the English Review, pressure from both Harper and Brothers and Methuen complicated Conrad's process of correction and revision. Both Harper and Brothers and Methuen planned to release Under Western Eyes in October 1911, so Conrad was forced to proceed with urgency. Harper ordered 4000 copies on 9 August and these were ready by 5 October. 22 Methuen ordered 3000 copies of Under Western Eyes on 5 September 1911, 750 of these for colonial issue. Methuen's domestic copies were bound and ready for distribution by 3 October. Conrad was still preparing the monthly instalments for the Eng- lish Review at this time. He had begun to correct and revise the English Review proofs of Part Four in July 1911, but by 1 August 1911 Harper and Brothers were anxious to finish setting up and called for the final pages of the novel. 23 Conrad wrote to Pinker, couldn't you propose to H. to set up at once from typed copy in their possession and send me over galley slips. I shan't detain them more than a couple of days and they could go back to them by the return boat. I would prefer this arrangement if possible—one corrects better on the printed page—quicker too. ( Letters, 4, 467-468) Conrad's suggestion that Harper set up "from typed copy in their possession " indicates that they might have used the typescript sent to the North American Review as setting copy for these final chapters (because of George Harvey's connection with both houses) and incorporated revisions as they arrived. Conrad suggested that "If they are quick about it they may have the whole matter settled and the corrected proofs with them by middle Sep t ". But, collation of all texts demonstrates that the setting copy for Harper and Brothers remained galley proofs of the continuing English Review serialisation. Conrad prepared setting copy for three different printers by correcting and revising, then transcribing, those changes to other sets of English Review galley proofs. This activity led to some confusion and as this latter period of correction and revision drew to a close Methuen's "beastly muddle" probably occurred. On 13 September 1911, Conrad wrote to Pinker about Methuen: It's true that in the first moment of irritation at such an instance of carelessness I told them I would not return the proofs in hand till I had a complete set in my possession; but the very next day (at their request) I returned them the first batch and the day after the whole lot right up to the page where the omission occurred. When I got the amended proofs at last I didn't keep them more than 48 hours. There was no delay on my part. As far as you are concerned I must say that all through you have done everything possible to spare me all extra trouble in revising both text and proof. ( Letters, 4, 478) What sort of "omission" occurred is unclear from this letter, but it is possible that in the rush to finish setting the novel a batch of English Review galley proofs was not delivered to Methuen, causing the omission. Alternatively, a batch without Conrad's corrections may have been delivered. Or, with three sets of proofs, Conrad may have had a preferred set which was destined for Methuen, and in the confusion of transcription, the wrong set was delivered . Without further evidence it is difficult to conclusively state what occurred at this time. But, because the error continued to vex Conrad, it is possible that Methuen's first English edition contains text that Conrad did not wish to be there. Nevertheless, since Conrad was aware of the muddle and evidently fixed it—in a hurry and under some pressure—it is necessary to look carefully at the textual variation in the last sections of the novel in relation to other patterns of variation from TS. 24</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The Texts of the English Review Galley Proofs As I have argued, Conrad corrected and revised three sets of galley proofs: one for the English Review; one for Harper and Brothers; and one for Methuen . Revision on one set of proofs was then followed by transcription onto the other two sets. Most revisions were transmitted to all three publications, But Conrad's transcription was not always successful because, as the figures quoted above indicate, a significant number of changes failed to be transcribed . Subsequently, the uncertainty surrounding Conrad's intentions in this process of transcription complicates conclusive attribution of Conrad's authority to many variants. Nevertheless, close examination of specific variants further supports the textual scenario I have proposed, revealing the effect that Conrad's method of transmission had on the texts under consideration. Approximately 580 substantive variants from TS appear in all three texts, representing Conrad's successful transcription between each set of English Review galley proofs. However, a number of cases show that Conrad revised each proof differently, perhaps inspired after the initial revision on one set of proofs. In TS we read this description of Madame de S—: "She disregarded it. Her carmine lips moved with an extraordinary rapidity". While the English Review text remains the same, Methuen's text replaces "moved" with "vaticinated" (220). Harper and Brothers' text retains the sentence, but adds, "She vaticinated" (221) The addition of such an unusual word only in both book publications strongly suggests Conrad's involvement, but the variation between them indicates that Conrad treated differently the various copies of each galley proof from which each text derives. Such a development is seen most strikingly in the last chapter of the novel where the original reading of Sophia Antonovna's "indulgent voice" from TS became "soft" for the North American Review, "prudent" for the English Review, "cautious" for Harper and Brothers and "guarded" for Methuen. From these and other examples found throughout the novel, one can see that Conrad's transcriptions were not always simple copying, but sometimes developments of earlier readings. Each set may have been used as a draft before a final revision was incorporated on one preferred set of galley slips. 25 This method of transcription often left the Harper and Brothers text without new readings incorporated in the English Review and Methuen. These variants are detected when all texts are compared, revealing agreements between Harper and Brothers and the North American Review that suggest a common relationship. 26 At first glance, this seems to contradict the picture drawn above of the transmission of the text. But, the agreements between Harper and Brothers and the American serial can be explained by identifying the document on which the change was made. If one assumes that the typescripts sent to the North American Review and the English Review were copies of TS, one would expect agreement between the serials except where Conrad made changes on the English Review galley proofs. For example , "vanishes" (TS29) reads "vanished" and "do not ask questions" (TS 120) reads "do you ask questions" in both American texts. The transmission of the latter example probably proceeded like this: The reading "do not ask questions" was incorrectly typed in April 1910 or changed by Robert Garnett during his corrections. The new reading, "do you ask questions" was transmitted to the North American Review and would have appeared in the English Review, had it not been corrected by Conrad on the galley proofs of the English serial. If this correction was not transcribed to the set of proofs prepared for Harper and Brothers, the earlier reading would remain, producing an agreement with the American serial. 27 The three sets of galley proofs that passed through Conrad's hands were treated differently, and, from the variants that appear through comparison, one must assume that the set for Harper and Brothers did not receive Conrad's full attention. This is most evident in readings that are unique to both English texts. Almost 200 variants fall into this category, further supporting the argument that Conrad did not correct and revise the galley proofs for Harper and Brothers to the same extent as the English sets. 28 For example, the TS reading that has Miss Haldin "walking alone in the main alley" (TS182) reads "walking alone in the main valley" in both English texts. Because this change was not transcribed to the set of proofs prepared for Harper, the reading in the text of the American first edition agrees with the unchanged reading in the American serial and TS. Many small readings such as this fall into the pattern of agreement between the English texts, especially in the second half of the novel when galley proofs were sent to Harper and Brothers with no corrections or revision. One of the most intriguing groups of variants produced by Conrad's use of English Review galley proofs is the unique readings found in the published English Review text. In chapters three and four of Part Four, 30 omissions and variations are unique to the published English Review text. For example, a passage that appears on TS"R15" reads, It was she who had been haunting him now. He had suffered from that persecution ever since she had suddenly appeared before him in the garden of the Villa Borel with an extended hand and the name of her brother on her lips. This passage appears in all published texts except the English Review serialisation , suggesting that Conrad might have deleted it from one set of galley proofs, but failed to transcribe the change to the sets of proofs sent to Harper and Methuen. Another example is found several pages later. The narrator describes Razumov's state of mind: "It was as though he had stabbed himself outside and had come in there to show it—and more than that as though he were turning the knife in the wound and watching the effect" (TS"S20"). The emphatic text that follows the dash in this passage is omitted only in the English serial. This collection of variants complicates the attribution of authority because of its inconsistency with the dominant patterns of variation found in the rest of the novel. A second, longer, omission involves the narrator's analysis of the attraction between Razumov and Natalia and shows Conrad's different treatment of the three sets of proofs: It was manifest that they must have been thinking of each other for a long time before they met. She had the letter from that beloved brother kindling her imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name; and it was impossible to imagine that the two women should have been kept out of the intercourse between such intimate political friends. And if he was at all attached to that friend, if he had any imagination for his character, it was enough to guide his thoughts to that friend's sister. She was no stranger to him when he saw her first; and to see that exceptional girl was enough. The only cause for surprise was his strange and gloomy aloofness before her clearly expressed welcome. But he was young and however austere and devoted to his revolutionary ideals he was not blind. (TS10-11) Higdon cites this variation as evidence that Conrad was consulting TS when preparing for book publication. Higdon argues that this passage is "no simple addition but instead is a complex reworking of a passage in the typescript cancelled before the English Review was set" (Higdon, 1991b, 177-178). It is highly unlikely that this passage was cancelled before the English Review was set because it was transmitted to the first American edition which, I argue, used English Review galley proofs as setting copy. The entire passage quoted above is found in Harper and Brothers' text. In Methuen's text the passage between "and it was impossible" and "She was no stranger to him when he saw her first;" is omitted. If Conrad was preparing three sets of galley proofs, the set for Harper and Brothers was untouched and the sets for the English Review and Methuen received different treatment. 29 It is most likely that the collection of unique omissions and additions in the English texts derive from two different sets of galley proofs, representing different moments of intention . However, because the majority of the variants unique to the English Review are found in one section of the October instalment, these variants might be the result of Methuen's "beastly muddle". 30 Conrad's acceptance of Methuen's text might be seen as a case of passive authorisation, but his continued dissatisfaction with Methuen suggests that he had some misgivings about the text of the first English edition. Unique readings in the Methuen text may indicate Conrad's continued involvement after corrected English Review galley proofs had been sent to Methuen as setting copy. For example, the Methuen text reads "a long time" instead of "many years" (TS2); "gouty invalid" for "gouty subject" (TS15); "other, flinging off his cap" was expanded from the simple "other" (TS21) to match an image of Haldin's hair several paragraphs later; and "gloomily" replaced "in a gloomy murmur" (TS35). Approximately 290 readings unique to the first English edition suggest that Conrad corrected Methuen's proofs; or, alternatively, he corrected and revised the English Review galley proofs for Methuen to a greater extent than the galley proofs he sent to the English Review. Of course, many of these changes might have been editorial or the work of a compositor. But, while the majority of unique readings could be attributed that way, most readings suggest Conrad's hand. For example, in the closing paragraphs of the first chapter of Part Third the following passage was omitted only in Methuen's text: Out of those pages summarising months here, detailing days there, with an almost incredible precision, out of the neat record of contradictory, incoherent thoughts emerges a personality struggling for existence both against truth and falsehood; a personality rising to a symbolic significance by the revealing nature of its individual fate. Higdon attributes the excision of this meditation on journals to Conrad, arguing that it was done "perhaps in a move to make his narrator more limited, less perceptive, more self-deluded about his true attraction to Razumov's story" (Higdon, 1991, 176). Such interpretations can allow attribution of Conrad's authority to larger variations. But, without further evidence, one can only attribute Conrad's authority to smaller variants with trepidation. The deadline set by Methuen arrived and Under Western Eyes was published , ending Conrad's opportunities to correct and revise, and establishing the version of the novel familiar to most readers. 31 The four published texts of Under Western Eyes reveal characteristics that give each text a unique status. The text of the North American Review remains closest to TS and probably resembles the text of the typescript "corrected" by Robert Garnett. The texts of the English Review, Harper and Brothers and Methuen are the result of Conrad's inconsistent revision of English Review galley proofs. There is little doubt that Conrad wanted Methuen's edition to represent his final intentions. But the mechanical processes of typing and typesetting that preceded its final state complicated this outcome, and undetectable errors may have been incorporated in Methuen's text. As the case of Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes stresses, readers must not disregard the physical and mechanical processes of textual production in their analyses of the history of texts, because these processes can have a significant effect on the way an author transmits a text to readers. Behind the stability of the text of Under Western Eyes familiar to readers is a complex network of transmission that poses many interpretative challenges; challenges that, when fully engaged, will offer a better understanding of Conrad and his texts.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Note 1 An extant typescript showing Conrad's revisions from April and May 1910 is held at the Philadelphia Free Library. The transmission of text from this revised typescript (TS) to Methuen's first edition has been discussed by David Leon Higdon (Higdon, 1991b). But because Higdon excludes the American texts from his analysis the fails to fully describe the material processes that produced the texts of Under Western Eyes. This essay rectifies this failure by providing a more comprehensive description of the textual transmission. 2 For more comprehensive descriptions of the extant typescript see Higdon, 1991a; Carabine, 1996; Osborne, 2000; and Osborne, 2002. 3 The similarities between the characters and events of Under Western Eyes and Conrad's family history have been comprehensively discussed (Carabine, 1996). Conrad's persistent medical problems and ongoing treatment also contributed to the breakdown. 4 For further discussion on this point see Osborne, 2002. 5 Robert Garnett was the critic Edward Garnett's brother. Edward Garnett had been Conrad's friend and confidante for many years and may have had some influence on Conrad's decision to shorten the text of Under Western Eyes in April 1910. 6 Karl and Davies note, "The size of each issue rather than the considerable size of its circulation" ( Letters, 4, 372, n., 1). 7 Both serials began monthly instalments in December 1910 and concluded in October 1911. 8 Of the approximately 1600 substantive variations from TS found in the published texts, there are 361 agreements between all published texts, indicating the number of changes possibly made by Garnett. A further 28 differences were restored to the TS reading on galley proofs of the English Review. Furthermore, most of the accidentals that are found in the first English edition originate from the typescript "corrected" by Robert Garnett. 9 As discussed above, Conrad probably saw batches of typescript when they returned with galley proofs of English Review instalments. There is no evidence, however, that Conrad corrected the typescript as a whole. 10 One substantial variation is the absence of Parts in the American serial. The North American Review chose to signal chapters only, most likely an editorial decision. 11 Before the final chapter of the novel the largest unique variation between the TS and the American serial is the omission of the sentence "It grew more depressing as one came nearer" (TS 292). 12 The text of the last page of Under Western Eyes in the North American Review finishes with "THE END" centred on the very last line of page 656. 13 Examination of the accidentals reveals a story similar to that told by the substantive variants. For example, of the 568 accidentals in the third chapter of Part Three, 18% are unique to the American serial, 32% appear in all published texts and 12% see agreement only between the English texts. Such a pattern appears in most chapters, showing that Robert Garnett (or his typist) was probably responsible for much of the punctuation added to the text when the new typed copy of TS was made. 14 The most obvious agreement between the TS and the two American publications is found in the last sentence of the novel. The TS and the two American publications all end with "Peter Ivanovitch is a wonderful man", whereas both English publications read " inspired man". Conrad probably changed this on the proofs of the English Review in August or September 1911, but did not transcribe it to the set of proofs sent to Harper. 15 One of the most obvious examples is the frequent changes like "Yes. Something . . ." to "Yes; something" or "Yes! A . . ." to "Yes, a . . .". These unique North American Review readings are found in almost every chapter, demonstrating that Harper and Brothers drew their text from another source—the galley proofs of the English Review serialisation. The large number of accidentals unique to Harper and Brothers' text indicates active house styling, making it difficult to identify any direct relationship with TS. Nevertheless, regular agreement between the English Review, Harper and Brothers and Methuen suggests a common source: galley proofs of the English Review. The accidentals unique to each publication are probably a result of house styling. 16 Conrad reiterated this point to Austin Harrison in 1912, writing, "Generally I don't care a bit for serial publication. . . . But in the case of the E. R. my feeling is different, since as in the case of Western Eyes the text of the E. R. would be the final text of the book form" ( Letters, 5, 444). As Higdon has shown, and I confirm below, this was not the case. 17 This letter is undated, but Karl and Davies place it after 29 April 1911 and before 10 May 1911 ( Letters, 4, 436). 18 That is, the North American Review typically agrees with TS, but the texts of the English Review, Methuen and Harper and Brothers contain the same variant. Approximately 39% of substantive variation from TS falls into this pattern. All percentages referred to in this essay were calculated from results of computer collation produced by MacCASE at the Australian Scholarly Editions Centre. 19 As with the corrected pages for Methuen this batch contained text up to the end of the second chapter of Part Three. 20 Robert Cunninghame Grahame is the only "friend" who can be situated near Conrad at this time (Knowles, 1990, 81). 21 On 12 January 1911 Conrad discussed the English Review proofs in a letter to Edward Garnett, saying "Directly I get 3 instalments or so of the novel together I'll send them to you. My copy of proofs is uncorrected as yet" ( Letters, 4, 407). There is no evidence to confirm that Garnett received this copy of proofs, nor why he was to receive them. Perhaps Conrad entertained the prospect of using some of the material excised in TS for book publication and had enlisted Garnett to assist. If this was Conrad's plan it did not occur and this set of galley proofs would have been available for use as setting copy in May 1911, requiring only transcription of changes made for the English Review. 22 Figures relating to the printing of Under Western Eyes have been supplied by the Center for Conrad Studies, Kent State University, from William R. Cagle's forthcoming bibliography of Conrad's works. 23 Harpers would give no publication date until final copy reached New York ( Letters, 4, 467). 24 Higdon has closely analysed the substantive and accidental variation between TS, the English serial and the Methuen text. He makes three conclusions regarding the correction and revision: "Conrad was a parsimonious writer who much preferred to adapt and readjust a sentence rather than to discard it, or add more than a few words to it. Second, he effected no major structural rearrangements or character redefinitions in this stage but rather concentrated on sharpening existing phrases and clarifying, often highlighting, character relationships. Third, his hand was not always successful in improving his text but sometimes ensnared him in unidiomatic phrasing and flabby sentences" (Higdon, 1991b, 180). Higdon also points out that although the Methuen text "may be the text that Conrad wished finally to be established, the book has moved far away from Conrad's usual practice in accidentals", and concludes that the serial is more authoritative in relation to Conrad's punctuation" (Higdon, 1991b, 181). 25 Of course, the variation between the two book versions might be considered compositorial error, but the major point, that Conrad inserted the word in both texts, remains. 26 This agreement accounts for only 2% of the variation from TS. American spellings account for a number of these, leaving only a very small percentage of significant variation. 27 Examination of the accidentals supports this explanation. Although the two American texts frequently agree, the high percentage of unique readings in both texts makes it difficult to argue that they are directly related. Furthermore, because the pattern of variation that sees the text of the English Review agree with both first editions dominates throughout the novel, galley proofs of the English Review (marked up by Conrad to different degrees) are the most likely setting copy for all three. 28 Agreement between the two English publications accounts for 13% of the substantive variation from TS. 29 An example similar to this situation is found in earlier chapters. Conrad originally named his female terrorist Sophia Semenovna (an explicit reference to one of Dostoevsky's characters), but later changed the last name to Antonovna. Because Conrad did not correct this late change on several occasions in TS, Semenovna was probably transmitted to both serials. When English Review galleys were made this error was still incorporated, but missed by Conrad and the English Review editors, because Semenovna appears on six occasions only in the English Review serial. Intervention on galley proofs or later proofs by Conrad or an editor produced the "correct" readings in Harper and Brothers and Methuen. 30 These variants are concentrated in one gathering of the October instalment. Of the sixteen pages in the gathering marked 2 G, eight pages contain the opening of the third chapter of Part Fourth. 31 Conrad had another opportunity to revise when Under Western Eyes was being prepared for publication in a series of Collected Editions of the 1920s. However, David Higdon's analysis of the variants in those editions shows that Conrad seemed "to have given no more than a perfunctory nod to the text of Under Western Eyes, trusting in the skills and good will of the firms of F. N. Doubleday and W. W. Heinemann" (Higdon, 1986, 129). Optical collation has confirmed this view.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">UNRECORDED WRITINGS BY G. K. CHESTERTON, H. G. WELLS, PADRAIC COLUM, MARY COLUM, T. S. ELIOT, GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, AND WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite their attempts to document exhaustively the work of particular authors, scholars often overlook the contributions of those writers to periodical publications. One result is that close inspection of periodicals is likely to yield a trove of unrecorded material. In what follows I would like to present my own recent gleanings from four such sources: The Nation of London, The Freeman and The Measure: A Journal of Poetry, both of New York, and the Dublin Magazine. While the findings are of varying significance individually, they are valuable cumulatively for the point they drive home about the need to investigate newspapers, magazines, and journals when considering the output of a writer. Though I confine the list below to primary materials, the entries point to the wealth of secondary comment that can also be found. Incidentally included here, for instance, are previously unnoted reviews of Willa Cather, John Galsworthy, Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, Rebecca West, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf. (The same pages of these journals contain additional responses to these writers as well as to people such as Joseph Conrad, Theodore Dreiser, Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Edith Wharton.) The discoveries here also hint of other primary sources not yet fully identified. Copyright notices accompanying two articles of G. K. Chesterton, for example, suggest earlier publication in the New York World, a newspaper now extremely difficult to find. Periodicals that print letters to the editor provide still another opportunity for scholars, because such columns sometimes include reactions to a writer's publications. One important source for the records that follow is the London publication The Nation. While the contents of some periodicals may be neglected because they are not indexed adequately, this one may have received less than its due because it is sometimes confused with a New York periodical of the same name. Its presence may be further obscured by the numerous shifts in its identity: founded in 1907, it absorbed The Athenaeum in 1921 (adding that name to its own title) and then merged with The New Statesman in 1931 (to become The New Statesman and Nation ). Henry William Massingham , who previously had written for or edited some five newspapers, was its influential editor from 1907 until April 1923; his role extended to reviewing most of the productions of the London stage. The report below is based on a survey of volumes 8 through 22 (from October 1910 through March 1918). The Freeman, published in New York, was founded by Helen Swift Neilson. It ran weekly from 17 March 1920 through 5 March 1924, appearing in eight volumes of 208 numbers. The editors of A Literary History of the United States describe it in the fourth edition of their Bibliography volume (1974) as "a liberal weekly magazine of political and literary criticism which achieved great distinction" (p. 63). Frank Luther Mott devotes twelve pages (pp. 88-99) to it in volume 5 of his History of American Magazines (1968), the best account in brief compass. The most prominent member of the editorial staff was Van Wyck Brooks, who wrote a volume titled "A Reviewer's Notebook." Likewise prominent, as reviewers and essayists, were the Colums, Padraic and his wife Mary. The Measure: A Journal of Poetry began in March 1921 and ran for sixty numbers to February 1926. Its nine-member editorial board included Padraic Colum, who remained in that role throughout the journal's lifetime. Colum was elected the quarterly "Acting Editor" for numbers 4, 5, and 6 (June, July, and August, 1921), succeeding Maxwell Anderson. Earlier in these pages I have reported the results of a search in the original Dublin Magazine, which ran from 1923 to 1958 ("Padraic Colum in The Dublin Magazine, " Studies in Bibliography 49 [1996], 284-290). The current treatment is less ambitious, adducing only a letter signed by T. S. Eliot, George Bernard Shaw, and ten others, though it might be noted that the magazine is also a rich source for unreported reviews of Eliot's writings.</field>
