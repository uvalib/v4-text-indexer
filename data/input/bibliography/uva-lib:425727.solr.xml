      <field name="fulltext">In the summer of 1986 the scholarly world was intrigued by the announcement of a major discovery: the manuscript of a hitherto unknown play by John Webster. In fact, what had been discovered in the muniment room at Melbourne Hall in Derbishire was an unidentified fragment of a play, which the co-discoverer, Mr. Felix Pryor, came to believe was by Webster. Mr. Pryor wrote a lengthy sale-catalogue describing the manuscript, and arguing for Webster's authorship of it, for Bloomsbury Book Auctions. This firm attempted to auction the manuscript on June 20, 1986, and set its anticipated price as between £200,000-£400,000; in the event, it did not reach its reserve, and as yet remains unsold. Thanks to the courtesy of the Marquis of Lothian, and the Trustees of the Melbourne Garden Charities, we have been enabled to make a fairly detailed examination of the manuscript, and to consider the question of attribution in greater depth. This article is a report on the results of that investigation. First, a slightly more detailed recapitulation of the events of 1986 will help to clarify the questions under investigation. The Melbourne Manuscript, as the document has come to be known (hereafter in this article simply the MS), was discovered in 1985 by Mr. Edward Saunders, who was sorting through the correspondence of Sir John Coke at Melbourne; Mr. Saunders then invited Mr. Pryor, who had formerly been a member of the staff of Sothebys, to attempt to identify it. Coke's letters were tied up in packets and kept in the Hall's muniment room; the MS under discussion had been used as wrapping paper for one of these packets (the words "Packet 3.", in pencil, are visible on the upper left corner of fol. 2 v ). 2 For reasons which are not entirely clear, no scholarly expert on Webster, or on the Jacobean drama in general, was permitted to examine the MS in any detail prior to the auction attempt. Professor Richard Proudfoot was permitted to inspect it, albeit rather cursorily, and wrote an announcement concerning it in the Times Literary Supplement . 3 The abortive auction followed on 20 June. Early in July Professor I. A. Shapiro challenged the attribution to Webster, in a letter to the TLS , in which he declared bluntly that "there are no grounds for attributing [the MS] to Webster, or to any pre-Restoration dramatist other than Shirley". 4 Shapiro's argument, which will be discussed in detail below, was based on the fact that the subject of the MS was derived from the same source-material as James Shirley's play The Traitor ; Shapiro believes that the handwriting of the MS is Shirley's, and he further demonstrated a plausible scenario to account for the MS's coming into the Cokes' possession. It is true that a central problem in Pryor's attempt to identify the MS as Webster's is that no Webster autograph of any kind exists. Shapiro (after a brief reply by Pryor 5 ) expanded on his argument in a second letter on 8 August, which was responded to by Proudfoot, who was not persuaded by Shapiro's arguments. 6 The issues raised in this correspondence will be addressed presently. At the time of writing, the matter rests at least so far as public debate on the MS is concerned. The net effect of the dispute has been unfortunate: it has drawn attention away from the indubitable fact that the MS is a fragment of foul papers from the Jacobean period, the only such fragment ever to have come to light 7 (a fact which alone makes it of inestimable value, no matter who wrote it). Instead it has focussed debate upon the matter of authorship, a question which, past experience should have warned everyone, is unlikely to be susceptible of rapid and universally-accepted conclusions. We address both issues in this article, but to redress the balance so far struck, treat the first as the more important.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The manuscript The MS is written on a single sheet of fairly good-quality writing paper, watermarked with a pot containing the initials PD; 8 the sheet measures approximately 15.5 by 12 inches, and was folded once to create pages of about seven and three-quarter by twelve inches (i.e. a normal foolscap dimension). The paper itself, subsequent to its being written upon, was folded twice more for use as a wrapping for the correspondence, and the outermost page (fol. 2 v ) has suffered as a consequence. An area of about a third of the page is discoloured and faded, and several words have been rendered illegible at the creases. There is also a small hole in the second folio, coinciding with one of these creases, and an ink stain near the top of fol. 1 v which obscures one word. Despite these damages, the writing is for the most part well-preserved, and the good general condition of the MS, considering the use to which it was put, is remarkable. However, the paper is clearly not strong, and the creases are in danger of tearing; we have recommended that preservative work be done on it to protect it from further deterioration. The text written on this paper is a part of a scene from a play (a modified typographical facsimile is provided at the end of this article). The scene is in progress at the beginning of the first page (which is numbered "2.", implying that the events it contains occur early in the dramatic action); it consists of a dialogue between Prince Alexander and his favorite, his cousin Lorenzo. The Prince begins by dismissing his attendants, and the only other speaking character (Alphonso); they leave in l. 7. The rest of the scene consists of Lorenzo's clever evasion of a charge of conspiracy, which the Prince has received against him in the form of a letter. Lorenzo establishes a humorous, witty tone with his cousin, affecting to think the whole matter a nonsense. He then turns round and admits the charge, but declares he was acting the role of a double agent, only seeming to join the conspirators in order to gain entry into their ranks and so to prevent their purposes. It is a lively scene, Lorenzo's prose in particular being racy and vivid, a highly theatrical mixture of colloquial, "low" style and learned allusion. The Prince's speeches, which are in verse, are more formal, but in no way incompetently written or uninteresting. In other words, the author of the MS was beyond any reasonable question a competent dramatist with a good deal of verbal and theatrical skill; there are none of the signs of the amateur or the closet-author in these pages. It is immediately evident that this scene has much in common with Act I scene ii of James Shirley's play The Traitor , in which the Duke of Florence (Alexander de Medici) confronts his cousin Lorenzo with an accusation of treason; Lorenzo defends himself, though in a different way (he straightforwardly appeals to the record of his loyalty) and uses very different language. At the very least this would suggest that the writer of the MS and Shirley were using a common source, but if so it is a source that has not been satisfactorily established. 9 At any rate, it is clear that the author of the MS followed customary Jacobean practice in basing his plot on an historical source; he was also following fashion in using an Italianate setting and writing a plot of political and personal intrigue. These points are worth notice since they bear an obvious relationship to the question of what kind of document the MS is. Until the discovery of this manuscript, everything that has been said about "foul papers" has been conjectural. Though there are several examples of fair copies, prompt copies, and scribal copies of Jacobean plays, hitherto there has been no known example of foul papers, whose characteristics have had to be inferred from casual contemporary comment, and from the characteristics of printed texts held to derive from them. The MS gives flesh to these inferences, and happily confirms them as far as its limits enable it to do. One immediately striking feature is that unlike prompt manuscripts, it does not divide one speech from the next by a horizontal stroke. The speech-prefixes are abbreviated, not consistently, but quite clearly (the Prince is either "Prince" or "Pr:", and Lorenzo is "Lorenz." or "Loren:" or "Lor:"), and placed slightly to the left of the dialogue, except in lines where revision has caused the writer to encroach upon the left-hand margin. The hand is current and fluent, but there is good cause to think that the author was careful and painstaking. Altogether there are at least 85 corrections in these four pages, more than one every second line. This is a high rate of alteration, and suggests at once a fastidious author, concerned with striking exactly the right note in dialogue, and with minor details of spelling and presentation as well. This impression is entirely confirmed by closer examination. Consider, for instance, l. 10, which was changed from "The roome nor the grizlie monsters Companie" to "The chamber for the grizlie monsters Companie", 10 with evident improvement to the rhythm; both alterations were effected by writing over the original words "roome" and "nor" to convert them into "chamber" and "for", a practice the writer evidently was habituated to. Lines 15-16 originally read "though that danger had | death for his Page", which was clearly intended to conclude Alexander's speech. However, the author improved Alexander's line to "though that danger had | for his attendant death", following which Lorenzo's ensuing line "By heav'n my Lord" makes up the pentameter (which would not have been the case with Alexander's original line). This suggests not only that the change was made currente calamo but that Lorenzo's line was not written until the change had been made. An even more interesting feature of this alteration is that the author in cancelling "death" also unwittingly or carelessly cancelled "for", a situation editors often hypothesize to account for strange readings in printed texts. In l. 24 "But Can the" was changed to "And Can the", then cancelled, and written again, "And Can theare", an interesting instance of authorial dither. Line 43 was struck out altogether, and replaced by a line squeezed in between it and the next line of the original. This strongly suggests authorial reconsideration subsequent to the original drafting of the lines, though not necessarily at a subsequent date. Usually there is no way of knowing whether alterations were made in the course of composition or later, but here the interlined l. 44 must surely have been, to some extent, an after-thought. In Lorenzo's satiric diatribe (ll. 49-70) the author can be seen carefully adjusting the colloquial language for maximum effect. In l. 50 the profane "slight" is changed to the milder "why" 11 ; in l. 53 "such small" is cancelled, and replaced by the sharper word "pettie"; in l. 55 the striking phrase "Ile Conjure his Coat" is replaced by the commoner, though still forceful expression "Ile clapperclaw the villaine"; in l. 58 a reference to the "time of plague" is changed to "a Visitation"; most strikingly, in l. 61 the expression "ffavorite", used elsewhere in the scene, is deleted in favour of the word "privado", a much rarer noun. 12 A little later, at l. 74, the entire clause "Knowe you foster in your bosome a serpent" was carefully eliminated. There is an interesting false start in l. 106, which begins with a speech-prefix for Lorenzo, even though the Prince is in the middle of a sentence. Finally, and most helpfully, there are four stage-directions in the pages. Unfortunately, they do not give any clue to which theatre or company the author was writing for, but still they yield valuable information. Though the mundane Exeunt at l. 7 is no great help, teares the subscription at ll. 47-48 is much more useful, since it indicates an action which cannot be inferred from the dialogue. Even more important is the direction at ll. 71-72, Hee reades the Prince attentively marking him , a perfect example of the kind of "literary" or "descriptive" stage-directions which Greg and others propose as characteristic of foul papers. Finally, at l. 82 we get a laconic read againe , in the imperative form allegedly characteristic of prompters. As the MS cannot be a prompt-book it is possible to deduce from this direction that the author was familiar enough with the theatre to know the form prompt directions took. A further inference from these directions is that the criteria for attempting to distinguish printed texts set up from foul-papers copy from those derived from prompt copy may have been too optimistic, since this author could obviously write directions that resemble both; presumably, so could other dramatists who were familiar with theatrical practice. These observations by no means exhaust the material available in the MS which confirms and extends our inferential knowledge of foul papers, but will serve to suggest the importance of the MS for study of this kind of dramatic manuscript, and cannot fail to cause thankfulness that, a piece of foul papers having been recovered, it should be so wonderfully informative. One other feature requires brief mention. There are several revisions of a more mundane nature: the author seems to have been troubled by what he may have thought was his old-fashioned spelling: at l. 47 "theare" is changed to "theire" (though "theare" in the sense "there" is left to stand at ll. 24, 33, 126, and 129); at ll. 42 and 100 "heare" was altered to the more conventional "heere". The fact that the author was addicted to correcting words, changing one word to another by making a palimpsest of it (rather than always scoring out and writing afresh) again suggests that the MS was revised, not only in the course of composition, but also subsequent to its initial drafting. However, it is possible that the practice may rather reflect the author's habits of composition. Either way, it would pose a series of near-insoluble problems to a compositor. What can usually be determined under bright light and magnification in 1986, namely which letters were written first, and which written over them, would not have been a practicable matter in the busy and probably ill-lit conditions of a Jacobean printing-shop. One cannot generalize of course, but if a compositor were trying to set from copy such as this (rather than a fair-copy transcript), the practice of correction by palimpsest would surely be reflected in strange readings in the typeset text. It therefore is of more than a little importance that the author be identified, not just for the sake of this MS, but for the light it might shed upon his other writings, in their printed form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authorship Unfortunately, as has been observed, the attempt to identify the author of the MS as Webster ran instantly into controversy. It will be necessary to resume some of the arguments briefly before bringing some other evidence into play and making our own conclusion. Pryor's sale-catalogue attempted to make the case for Webster from a variety of angles. First, he argued on the basis of stylistic resemblance, citing the similarity between Lorenzo's verbal manner and the satiric mode of Flamineo in The White Devil and Bosola in The Dutchesse of Malfy . 13 He explained the connexion between the MS and Shirley's The Traitor by presuming that the former was a source for the latter, and discussed the various opinions extant concerning Shirley's other source(s). He then returned to considering the similarities between the subject-matter and characters of the MS and Webster's two principal tragedies, and also considered other dramatic sources for the MS, such as Hamlet , Marston's plays, and Jonson's Sejanus , (there is a reference to Sejanus in l. 137 of the MS, which might be to the play rather than to the historical character). From these he attempted to date the MS, lighting on the 1606-1609 period. Despite all the territory he surveyed, the only real argument he was able to advance for thinking the play Webster's was stylistic. 14 Unsatisfactory though this may be, it convinced the German critic and translator of Webster, Alfred Marnau, whose long familiarity with Webster's style from a translator's special viewpoint encouraged him to agree with Pryor that the MS is authentically Webster's. Two English scholars, Richard Proudfoot and Muriel Bradbrook, have been much more reserved in their responses. 15 A natural objection to thinking that the play of which the MS is a part is Webster's is that he makes no mention of it anywhere. We know from his Preface to The Devils Law-case that he wrote a play about the Duke of Guise; in the same sentence he refers to "others" in addition to it, The White Devil and The Dutchesse of Malfy . Samuel Sheppard, in some laudatory verses written in 1624-25, speaks of Webster's "three noble Tragedies"; 16 and—presuming the Guise to have been a tragedy—this leaves no room for the play of the MS. However, it is conceivable that the Guise may have been a "bitter" tragi-comedy like The Devils Lawcase , or that Sheppard may have been mistaken. And of course there is no physical evidence (a) that the MS was itself ever finished; (b) that if it was, it was itself necessarily entirely tragic in mode; (c) that the play was entirely one author's work; (d) that even if completed it was ever staged. 17 All that can be said with certainty is that the MS is not all of the play that ever existed (the numeral 2. at the top of fol. 1 r implies beyond reasonable doubt a preceding sheet), and that James Shirley did indeed write a play about these characters. This brings us to the controversy initiated by Shapiro, who declared bluntly, "It should have been obvious to anyone studying the Melbourne manuscript that it is a rejected early version of the second scene of Shirley's The Traitor ", and commented that "readiness to accept, as reliable, 'conclusions' based only on stylistic 'evidence' by 'literary critics' (academic or other) has betrayed generations of undergraduates, and also some seniors." 18 Shapiro's authority is formidable, and his caveat well-taken, but what he declares to be "obvious" is not so to us. His own arguments are developed from two scholarly, rather than literary, bases: that the handwriting of the MS is recognizable as Shirley's, and that the provenance of the MS argues strongly for Shirley rather than Webster as the author. There is a possible connexion between Shirley and the Cokes (set out at length in Shapiro's TLS letter of 4 July): Thomas Coke, Sir John's younger son, was at Gray's Inn at the time when Shirley, who was admitted to the Inn in January 1633/4, was appointed to write the masque, The Triumph of Peace , which was presented in February 1633/4. Thomas wrote in October 1633 about the forthcoming revels, and this interest, combined with the fact that Shirley was probably friendly with other members of the Inn before his admission, perhaps including Sir John Coke the younger, leads Shapiro to the conclusion that "We should not therefore be surprised to find that a sheet of manuscript from an early draft of Shirley's The Traitor was in 1640 lying discarded at Gray's Inn, and used for wrapping up a packet of documents." 19 Certainly this scenario is plausible, but it is not inevitable. Pryor himself believed the MS had been used as a source for The Traitor , and consequently that it must have come into Shirley's hands. Even if it were not exactly a source, there is nothing impossible in Shirley's having in his possession another dramatist's unwanted manuscript on the same subject as his intended play. And even if Shirley himself was not the means by which the MS came into Coke's hands, there are other possible scenarios to account for it. But here we wander into unprofitable speculation. It is preferable to turn instead to the palaeographical issue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Palaeography The MS is written in a mixed hand, chiefly secretary, with a fair number of italian (or italic) forms. Dating such a hand is extremely difficult; the most that can be said is that it is highly unlikely to be earlier than 1600, and (in view of the nature of the document) also unlikely to be later than 1630. But of course if the writer was old, or old-fashioned, it could be later. There is nothing inherently impossible in the writing alone to prevent its being dated around 1610. 20 The best compendium of holographs from the period is Greg's English Literary Autographs , a set of excellent facsimiles of the hands of known authors, and the natural first quarry for comparisons. It is interesting how few of the well-known dramatists failed to leave some scrap of their writing for posterity: Greene, Beaumont, Webster, Ford, and William Rowley are about the only men of note in the period for whom the record is blank. It is much to be hoped that no one will suggest that the MS might be by Greene, Beaumont, or Rowley; even on Shapiro's despised stylistic grounds alone such an attribution seems self-evidently impossible. Ford, actually, is not any likelier; but then, at this level of comparison, neither is Shirley, whose extant dramatic works do not at all resemble the dramaturgy represented by the MS. 21 Of the thirty-seven hands illustrated in the Dramatists volume of Greg's survey, not one looks seriously like the MS. Field's has some general resemblance, but the formation of th is totally different. Shirley, Fletcher, and Middleton are found in Volume 3 of Greg, and our initial reaction was that none of these were possible candidates either. Professor Shapiro's authority, however, demands a re-consideration, and requires a short summary of his published arguments. His assertion that "anyone competent in handwriting of the period will agree" that the MS is in the same hand as that found in Greg, No. XCV(d) is, however, rather extreme (especially in view of the fact that he was relying on the much-reduced facsimile of the first page of the MS printed as a frontispiece to the sale catalogue). 22 His subsequent letter (22 August 1986) draws attention to other documentary evidence. There is an autograph Latin attestation and signature of Shirley's, dated 1623, in an elegant italian hand, from the Hertford-shire County Record office; there is the Bodleian manuscript of his poems (MS. Rawlinson Poet. 88); and from Longleat documents relating to the organization and performance of the masque The Triumph of Peace : these are reproduced in a good modern edition by the musicologist Murray Lefkowitz. 23 This last, Shapiro declared, "puts beyond doubt, should any remain, that [Shirley] wrote the 'Melbourne Manuscript'", and, he maintained, demonstrates that the script found on plate VIII of Lefkowitz's edition is "unquestionably" the script of the MS. We do not agree at all with this asseveration. Part of the difficulty in making any identifications is that Shirley wrote both secretary and italian hand (and its development, the "round" hand), 24 and that much of his italian or round writing is of a formal, calligraphic nature. Like most writers in this period, he often wrote a "mixed" hand, in which secretary forms co-exist with italian, or vice-versa. The Longleat is of this nature: we were not able to see the original of this manuscript, but Lefkowitz's facsimile is quite good. It reveals a script largely italian in its letter-forms, though certain letters are secretary; the letters are cursively formed, but detached rather than linked together. It thus presents so totally different an appearance from the cursive mixed secretary of the MS—as one might say, the entire ductus is different—that we feel that any claim that their scribes were the same should be made, if at all, only with caution and reservation. Comparison of letter-forms alone has been recognized as an inadequate guide to identification of scribes; it is preferable to examine entire lexical units such as words, or at least letter-combinations, as well as considering individual letters. Most of the material on Lefkowitz's plate VIII consists of proper names, none of which occur in the MS, but there is also an inscription, "The figure for | the first going | vp to the state". There are plenty of examples of "for" in the MS, none identical with this; there are four examples of "first", all distinctly different (the Longleat version is almost pure italian): when the MS forms the word the same way, the last two letters are always a digraph, with a characteristically low bar for the t , extended into a tail. There is a clear "state" in l. 24 of the MS, a much less clear "states" in l. 123, and a good "statesmen" in 128. The formation of the st in both ll. 24 and 128 shows that the connexion between the s and the t is formed in the MS with the direction of the pen's movement opposite to that in the Longleat, and the terminal e in the MS is looped, while in Longleat it is in a common secretary form which is found frequently in Shirley, but nowhere in the MS: an opened form, made something like two (modern) c s one above the other. This e is characteristic of the Longleat script. There are indeed some similarities between the letter-forms of the MS and the Longleat: the first word, "The" has a superficial resemblance to the MS's use of the word in, for instance, ll. 2 and 10, but in both of these examples (and elsewhere) the cross of the T is lower than the upstroke of the h . The capital P is strikingly similar, but is not the same: Shirley forms it in two strokes: a descending vertical with a serif to the right or the left, and a loop starting from halfway down the descending stroke and swooping elegantly over the top. The MS makes a P in a single stroke, beginning with the downstroke, making a serif from right to left and then carrying the stroke up and backwards to cross the downstroke and curve over the top of the letter. The word "Page" occurs both in Longleat and in the MS (l. 16, where it is cancelled, but perfectly legible), and these illustrate the difference in the letters admirably; they also show the difference in the letter e . Nor do the capital L s look identical to us: those in the Longleat have a foot which may drop down (as in "W. Lawes"), or curve down then up again (as in "J. Lawes"), or else flat (as in "Laughton"). The MS has numerous capital L s, thanks to the character Lorenzo; the characteristic form of the foot of the letter is a sinuous line, beginning with an upward movement, curving down, and then flattening or curving up again. "Ladies" in l. 69 is a good example, as is the "Lorenz." speech-prefix in l. 49, and the "Loren." prefix in l. 99. This form of the letter is not found in Longleat, much less the form in l. 75, where the foot is begun with a little loop to the left of the descending stroke. The L s in the calligraphic Rawlinson MS are quite different; the two L s on the last two, more current, pages, resemble that in "J. Lawes" in Longleat, but not those in the MS. More important than any other Shirley document, however, is the play The Court Secret , the manuscript of which is held in the library of Worcester College, Oxford. 25 Since R. G. Howarth's work on the play, this has been regarded as a scribal manuscript, to which additions and corrections had been made in a late mixed secretary hand, which Howarth reasonably concluded was Shirley's: 26 it was from the final, secretary-hand page of this manuscript that Greg drew his facsimile, plate XCV(d). We examined the entire manuscript directly, with a full-size photograph of the Melbourne MS to hand, and in our opinion the handwriting of the secretary additions to The Court Secret is not the same as that of the Melbourne. Most of the corrections in The Court Secret consist merely of deletions, but there are some score of secretary-hand interpolations. 27 These differ from each other to some extent partly because of their being crowded into margins and between lines. But they share a family resemblance; some of Shirley's very characteristic letter-forms are present, such as the e noted above. The other e commonly used is a Greek e , and there is an r not dissimilar in shape to it. As has been noted, Shirley's capital P is at first glance very like that of the MS, but is usually made with a flat foot; the MS's P loops back through the descending stroke. The th form varies, but none of Shirley's resemble those of the MS. Shirley's secretary handwriting in the play is very nearly vertical, while that of the MS is much more slanted, though to some extent that is circumstantial, deriving from the cramped conditions in which Shirley was correcting The Court Secret . Instead of the double long s used in the MS, Shirley uses a long s -short s combination (of course the corrections to The Court Secret are later in date than the MS is presumed to be). In the nature of things, there are similarities between the The Court Secret hand and that of the MS. On fol. 10 r of the play, the word "ruine" has a flourish above the e not unlike some of those in the MS; there are other examples. In the additions on the blank final recto (the page Greg reproduced), in the fourth line the double f resembles the MS's way of forming these letters. The words which exist both in the secretary-hand corrections to The Court Secret and in the MS provide the best sources for comparison, and by great good fortune there happens to be a character called Alphonso in both. The name is written in the annotations in The Court Secret on fol. 17 r and three times on fol. 18 v ; each written form is marginally different, but all are basically similar. The MS uses the name twice, and an abbreviated form of it as a speech-prefix once, all in the first six lines. The capital A s of the MS are narrower in their spread than Shirley's; the p is not closed, the h not as looped, and (most obviously) the MS uses a long s where Shirley uses an italian one. Capital A crops up twice again in The Court Secret : on the blank final recto both times it has little serifs; the MS has a number of capital A s, none quite like this. The word "happinesse" occurs in both texts: l. 22 of the MS, and ll. 6 and 9 of the final page of The Court Secret . The writing could scarcely be more dissimilar, with Shirley's neatly looped h s, slightly differently formed, but perfectly consistent double p s, the characteristic "double c" e s, and the long s -short s combination; the MS has an unlooped h , two wild flails for the p s, one normal secretary e and one italian, and a grandly soaring double s digraph, a form of s common in the MS and nowhere to be found in The Court Secret . Theatrical words like "Enter" and "Exit" also occur: the two "Exit"s on fol. 2 r are worth comparing: the t of the first, looped up to the right to form the cross-stroke, is unlike any in the MS, but that of the second is a little more like some of the MS's t s, except that Shirley makes the bar near the middle of the letter, and the MS almost at its foot. Shapiro argues that Shirley, having been the employee of a professional scrivener, Thomas Frith, was trained to write different kinds of scripts fluently. This may very well have been the case, and it is not hard to believe that the elegant letter-forms and controlled tempo of the various examples of script that no-one disputes to be Shirley's, such as the Rawlinson and Longleat manuscripts, look like the work of a man with professional rather than merely school training. This being the case, it is not surprising to find that when Shirley is writing more casually, as in the corrections to The Court Secret , his writing remains relatively tidy and well-paced. It is a long way from such good writing to the characterful but erratic and careless script of the MS, which in our view is unlikely to be the work of a trained scrivener, even at his most insouciant. Shapiro believes that the writing of a document intended for the scribe's eyes only will be ipso facto of a different order of neatness and legibility from any document intended for others to read. This may be true, or it may not: there are historical examples both ways, which of themselves have little bearing on this case. But there is a grave difficulty inherent in the argument, namely, that because the MS is "foul" its letter-forms will necessarily differ to a greater or lesser degree from those in the scribe's formal or public writings. If carried to a reductio ad absurdum , it would appear that Shapiro is asking us to accept the MS as Shirley's because its letter-forms are different from Shirley's. To state it thus is unfair; he, no doubt, would formulate it that the MS letter-forms are recognizable as variants of Shirley's "public" forms, the variation occasioned by the nature of the MS. We feel that in a case like this, the argument is not strong enough to carry conviction. What is needed are several letter-forms or combinations which are absolutely unique to Shirley, and which occur in exactly the same form in the MS. In our opinion, Shapiro has not been able to satisfy this stringent criterion, and consequently, in our judgement, the identity of the scribe of the MS remains open on palaeographical grounds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vocabulary and Spelling A test on the vocabulary of the MS yielded interesting results. There are altogether 553 different words legible in the MS (illegible words and words we were obliged to guess at are omitted from the count), of which 29 are proper nouns and 15 are abbreviations of words which would normally be spelled out in full in a printed text. Eliminating the proper names, and such abbreviations as elsewhere are spelled in full, we are left with a vocabulary of 515 words. A reasonable test of Webster's possible authorship is to compare this vocabulary with Webster's usage, as derived from the concordance. 28 There are cautions to be observed here, since the concordance is based on an edited version of the texts (Lucas's), and while it concords some of the works in which Webster collaborated with other writers, it excludes the uncertain texts ( Anything for a Quiet Life, A Cure for a Cuckold , and others even less likely). Nonetheless, it can yield some raw data. Of the 515-word vocabulary of the MS, 388 words are found in the Webster concordance, an agreement rate of only 75%. At first sight a 25% disagreement rate would seem to rule out Webster's authorship. But the figures need to be refined. In addition to the 388 words which occur, another 59 occur but in different spellings. This leaves 65 words in the fragment which do not occur in the Webster concordance at all, a verbal novelty rate of 12.6%. This seems very large too, but a glance at the concordance will show that Webster enjoyed using words only once or twice. It seemed sensible to concord separately a passage of similar size to the MS from another work, and compare its rate of unique words. This posed some stringent parameters. First, the passage ought to be unquestionably by Webster; second, it ought if possible to derive from foul papers; third, again if possible, it should have been set by a naive compositor, 29 fourth, it should involve subject-matter as close in style to that of the MS as possible. These conditions entailed choosing The White Devil for the experiment, the only unquestionable Webster text for which there is evidence of foul-papers copy, 30 and they entailed choosing a passage from the first few gatherings of the book, which were set by the naive Compositor N; 31 finally we settled on Act I scene ii as being closest in material and manner to the MS. The passage chosen had a rather larger vocabulary than the MS: 595 words, of which only 7 were proper nouns, and none were abbreviations. After eliminating words which were spelled in more than one way, a vocabulary of 579 words was left. 29 of these words (5%) were spelled in ways not elsewhere found in the concordance, and no fewer than 52 words (9%) were unique. 9% of 579 is still not so large a percentage as the 12.6% of 515 of the MS, but it does not inhabit a different statistical world; on the contrary, it argues that there is no reason in the vocabulary to suggest that the MS could not have been written by Webster. Besides, there are other factors. If the number of unique words is expanded to include words that occur only elsewhere in The White Devil , the number rises from 52 to 63, or 10.9% (it is evident that Webster had a tendency to use a special vocabulary for each work). A list of the 65 unique words in the MS follows (diplomatically transcribed), with some comments. alteration anticipation approaching attendant attentively avowed bookish clapperclawe condescending Conspiracie Converts damosell discharging doubtefull easier enacted expecting exhibited Exiles faultie fauorite (and ffauorite) ffauorites fealing firde foster grizlie hearted ieopardie infallible inspecting innovate laconice languishing marking mistresses myselfe mysterie oblation owest pales potle * pots priuado progenie proscription quaffers resounding slight soere (and soe're) spartan sphinx subscription Tauerners thundring unlawfully unvolve veritie vigilant virtue wedded whosoeuer withdrawing A first reaction to this list is that with very few exceptions ("clapperclawe", the latin laconice , "privado" [we now resume the conventional u/v, i/j spellings, and eliminate upper-case, for ease of comparison], and perhaps "unvolve"), the vocabulary is not unusual. Yet the impression is nothing more than that, and, it may be argued, is misleading. For instance, it is remarkable that in this short fragment there are no fewer than thirteen words which do not appear anywhere in Shakespeare: "attentively", "avowed", "condescending", "damosel" (though "damsel" and "damosella" do), "exhibited," "exiles" (though "exile" does), "innovate", "inspecting", "laconice", "privado", "quaffers", "resounding", "taverners", "unvolved"; other words are found in Shakespeare only once or twice. Nonetheless, the feeling persists that the vocabulary is not esoteric: indeed, it is rather surprising that Webster was able to do without some of these words: who would have guessed that "conspiracy", "doubtful", "favourite", "feeling", "mistresses", "myself", "mystery", "slight", and "virtue" did not form part of his vocabulary? Similarly, there are a few words in the MS which seem very characteristic of Webster, such as "intelligencers". But this leads us into stylistic comparisons, which are dealt with elsewhere. A second impression, more persistent, is surprise at the number of verbal nouns in the list: no fewer than eleven. This is the sort of vocabulary feature which is virtually impossible to get statistical evidence upon without either a computer programme (which we do not have) or without very laborious manual searching and counting, which would hardly be worth the effort. So it must remain as an impression that the MS uses more verbal nouns than Webster habitually did. 32 A third impression, confirmed by inspection, is that a number of items on the list are unique only in a limited sense: other parts of the word occur elsewhere in Webster. Some details of these would be in order. It is true that, for instance, not only do "condescending", "fealing", "inspecting" and "languishing" not occur elsewhere in Webster, but neither do "condescend" or "condescension", "feeling" (there are some uses of "feelingly", but chiefly in Northward Ho !), or any forms of "inspect", or "languish". However, "discharge" and "discharged" occur, as do "enact", "exhibition", "exile", "expect", "innovation" (once, in Appius and Virginia ), "mark(e)", "mistresse" (and the usual spelling, "mistris"), "my selfe", "owe", "proscribe" (also once, in Appius ), "resound", "spie", "subscribed", "thunder", "unlawfull", "wed" and "wedding", and "withdraw". This makes the list of unique words sensibly less, and confirms the essential normality of the MS's vocabulary. Let us turn now to spellings. Trevor Howard-Hill's aphorism, "all spellings are compositorial", must be kept very firmly in mind when comparing the spellings of a manuscript with those of printed texts: the raw statistics in such circumstances prove nothing whatever. Nonetheless, for the record, there are 59 words in the MS whose spellings differ from any of those recorded in the Webster concordance: 11.5% of the total. In the same passage from The White Devil , the parallel figures are 29 and 5%. These are larger figures than one would have expected in a printed text, but the high proportion of unique spellings may be attributed in part to the naive compositor, and in part to the large proportion of prose in the scene, which may well have tempted the compositor into some unusual justification-spellings. Rather than list the unique spellings of the MS, it makes more sense to comment on the more significant examples. It will be easier to assimilate these if we arrange them (as it were) as the case for the prosecution against Webster's authorship, and the case for the defence. First, then, the prosecution: the MS's preference for "bee" over "be" (11 to 1) reverses the preferences of the printed texts (11.5 pages in the concordance of "be" compared with 2 pages of "bee"); likewise the MS's invariable "hee" (6 uses) disagrees with the statistics of the concordance (over 12 pages of "he" to 4 of "hee"). "Chaunge" in the MS is not found in Webster, where the word is always "change". "Companie" is always "company"; there is one "els" (as in the MS) to 37 uses of "else". In the MS "growe" occurs twice; in Webster it is always "grow"; similarly the MS uses "hande", Webster "hand". "Lett" is not found in Webster; nor is "myselfe" as a single word (invariably "my selfe"). The MS spells "noe" consistently; in the concordance there are six and a half pages of "no" to six individual uses of "noe"; even more telling is the fact that the concordance prints over eight pages of "so", and no instance of "soe", which the MS uses invariably (four times). "Putt", which the MS uses five times, occurs no-where in the printed canon, where the spelling is always "put"; another word with a doubled terminal consonant in the MS is "sett", which is invariably "set" in Webster. 33 The MS prefers "theare" (four times), a form unused in Webster. "Privat" is always "private" in Webster, and "wrongue" is always "wrong". This is only a selection of the spellings found in the MS which go against the common practice in Webster's printed texts. Cross-examining, the defence properly points out that scribal spellings were, in the early seventeenth century, usually more archaic than compositor's spellings: the doubled consonants of "sett" and "putt", and the silent e at the end of "soe" and "noe" would be the first things a compositor would get rid of. It is interesting that most of the "bee" spellings in the concordance are from Compositor B in The White Devil , an early text in the Webster canon; the remainder derive from the Ho! plays (also early) and from Characters , a book set by compositors who did no other work on Webster. This suggests it is unwise to overlook the importance of house-styling: note for instance that while the MS spells "weele", a form that occurs quite frequently in The Devils Law-case and in Northward Ho! , in Appius and Virginia the usual form is "we'l"; in The White Devil it is "we'le", and in The Dutchesse of Malfy it is "we'll": evidence that many spellings are not so much compositorial as managerial. The defence rounds off its cross-examination by observing that the presence or absence of terminal silent e is too slight a reed to base any serious conclusions upon. Turning now to its own case, the defence presents the following evidence. The MS follows Webster's preference for "hath" rather than "has", which does not appear in it. The combined word "infaith" which the MS uses is sufficiently unusual to remark upon its appearance in The White Devil and the Ho! plays. The MS's spelling "lesse" agrees with Webster's preferences, since "less" does not appear in the concordance; likewise the MS's "read", which appears four times to once for "reade", agrees with Webster's preferences. Anticipating the prosecution's complaint that such random agreements are inevitable, the defence cites the spelling "graund", as an honorific, which unusual form appears three times in the concordance, and "tyme", which to be sure occurs only once in Webster, but that once is in the verses to the portrait of King James and his progeny: verses which were engraved not typeset, and which for that reason may well preserve copy-spellings more exactly. Another similar case is the spelling "eare" (=ere), a form also found in the Portrait verses, and in The White Devil and Westward Ho! , both early texts. The most that a fair judge can say in summing up this evidence is that it is equivocal. There are a fair number of spellings in the MS which cannot be matched in the printed Webster canon, but that fact alone is not at all surprising. The MS itself reveals a number of internal multiple spellings: "all" and "alle" ("alle" is not to be found in the concordance), "be" and "bee", "danger" and "daunger", "do" and "doe", "happie" and "happy", "heare" and "heere", "know" and "knowe", "maie" and "may", "read" and "reade", "recconings" and "reckoning", "run" and "runne", "safetie" and "safety", "theire" and "their", "waie" and "way". A seventeenth-century writer was under no compulsion to be consistent in his spellings, of course; neither was he likely, in a foul papers document like this, to vary spellings in order to fill out the lines. His mental attitude towards spellings thus was the reverse of a compositor's on these two crucial points. On the other hand there are no spelling usages in the MS which match any spectacularly unusual Websterian spelling that could help to clinch the case: disappointing, but not surprising, in view of the small size of the sample. Nothing in the spellings found in the MS and not found in the concordance is so unusual as to be beyond the range of master-printer's or compositor's regularization, though some cases are certainly debatable. For instance, note the MS's spellings "all one" as two words (a form that occurs nowhere in Webster), for "alone" though it is possible that the spelling may reflect a pun, especially in view of the normal "alone" in the third line. Then there is "carreir" ("cariere" and "carreere" once each in The White Devil , and elsewhere not used), "choler" ("choller" once each in The Dutchesse of Malfy and The Devils Law-case ), "curde" (once "cur'd", once "cur'de", thrice "cured"), "hart" (it occurs in Webster, chiefly in the Ho! plays, but the usual spelling is "heart"—note, however, the MS's "hearted"), "hight" ("height" or "heighth"), "hue" ("hew" twice), "howse" ("house"), "shune" (one "shunne", six "shun"), and others less telling. Probably little is to be gained by combing this evidence any more carefully. One must remember that the spellings in printed texts are not only compositorial, but may also reflect scribal practice (where printer's copy was a scribal transcript, as in the case of The Dutchesse of Malfy ; the nature of printer's copy for some of Webster's plays is still an open question): two systems of spelling may well intervene between the author and the printed form, and the likelihood of drawing any correct inferences from such spellings as can be cited is thereby sensibly diminished. The verdict, then, is that while the spelling-structures of the MS differ quite substantially from those found in Webster's published works, collectively the differences do not add up to a decisive case for the rejection of Webster as the author of the MS. Nor, it must be conceded plainly, do they provide any overwhelming ammunition to confirm it. 34 Another subject worthy of brief mention is the punctuation of the MS. In its 144 lines it uses 37 commas, 15 semicolons, 17 colons, 25 periods, 7 question-marks and one pair of inverted commas. 35 This is 101 punctuation marks for 144 lines, or an average of 0.71 punctuation marks per line. It is light punctuation, and as a reading of the transcript will show, not invariably helpful or intelligible punctuation, though often the pointing is vivid and characterful. The punctuation of that part of The White Devil set by Compositor N averaged 1.27 punctuation marks per line (by comparison with the much heavier punctuation, 1.5 marks per line, in those parts of the play set by Compositors A and B). 36 The most that can be said is that the punctuation is not unlike that of the early gatherings of The White Devil , but then as much might be said of any lightly punctuated dramatic manuscript. To put it another way, there is nothing in the punctuation of the MS which is in any way outré , or which cannot be matched in Webster. 37</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Linguistic Tests As noted above, Professor Cyrus Hoy has done more to bring order to the attribution of authorship in the Jacobean era than any other scholar. It is owing to his researches that the respective shares of playwrights in the so-called Beaumont and Fletcher canon can now be discussed with some degree of confidence. Unfortunately, the data on Webster, which Hoy derived from the three major plays, contain some alarming inconsistencies. The survey he made to determine if Webster had a share in The Honest Man's Fortune seemed to establish that Webster had a strong preference for "hath" and "doth" rather than "has" and "does", and that he virtually never used the abbreviation "'em", preferring instead the full form "them", but that he did regularly employ such contracted forms as "i'th'" and "o'th'" (or "a'th") and "'s" for "his", but not the contraction "y'", or "ye" for the second person plural. Strangely, in The Devils Law-case , Webster uses "has" almost exclusively, and uses a few of both "y'" and "ye", a startling degree of inconsistency. 38 It seemed worthwhile to extend Hoy's sample into the other concorded texts. 39 This search revealed that "a'th" and its cognate forms, "a'the", "a'th'", and "ath'" occur 21 times, almost exclusively in The Devils Law-case and The White Devil (there is one usage in Monuments of Honor , and one in the Characters ). "Does" occurs 20 times, all but six in The Devils Law-case ; "doth" 107 times; "'em" only four times, against "them" 382 times; "has" 98 times, all but 15 of which are in Devil's Law-case , against 256 uses of "hath". The contractions "i'th", "i'th'" occur 129 times, "i'th" chiefly in Devils Law-case , "i'th'" in the other works, but at a much lower frequency rate (36 for Devils Law-case compared to 21 of both forms together in White Devil ). "O'th", "o'th'" and "o'the" occur altogether 43 times, only one of which is from Appius and Virginia , and none at all from the Characters . Finally, the "y'" contraction occurs 13 times, as "y'are" 12 times and "y'ave" once; save one "y'are" in Monuments of Honor , all these uses are in Devils Law-case and Appius and Virginia . "Ye" is found eight times, but "you" occurs over 2600 times. The MS agrees with these preferences in using "hath", "them" and "you" to the exclusion of "has", "'em" and "ye/y'"; neither "doth" nor "does" occurs; but most damagingly, none of the Websterian contracted forms is to be found. A closer look, however, reveals surprisingly few places where the contracted constructions could have been used: l. 58 ("in y e "), and ll. 76, 118 and 143 ("of y e "). Besides, of these four only one (l. 118) is in verse, where such contractions are, on the whole, more likely to be used. Still, the plain fact is that they are not used, and prima facie this is a major strike against Webster's authorship of the MS. However, it seemed an obvious step to examine the four pages of The White Devil selected above for vocabulary tests from this linguistic point of view also. Like the MS, it agrees with the general statistics by using "doth", "hath", "them", and "you"; it uses only one of the contracted forms ("ath'/a'the", thrice, in prose passages), and there are at least two places in the scene where a contraction might have been used but was not ("in the"). The relative infrequency of the use of contracted forms in the Webster canon, combined with the fact that he did use uncontracted forms on occasion, means that their absence from the MS cannot be regarded as absolutely ruling out Webster's authorship, in view of the agreement in the case of the more common linguistic preferences. But, once again, it strikes an equivocal note, weakening, not strengthening, the case. 40 Of course there are other verbal and linguistic tests that might be used to explore these questions further, especially the sort of collocational tests of linguistic patterns which computers are now beginning to perform on literary texts. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, we lack the appropriate programmes and facilities to carry out such tests; this must be a matter for subsequent investigation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Subject-matter and Style Despite Shapiro's brusque dismissal of stylistic comparisons, we feel that this subject must be at least considered. The heady old days of "parallel passages" are, no doubt, safely in the past. Yet it would be idle to deny that authors do have a characteristic style and tone, however difficult these may be to define: they write like themselves. Pryor's catalogue was undoubtedly over-enthusiastic in its stylistic comparisons, but we feel that there is an important kernel of truth in his observations which needs reiteration. The MS in many ways is strikingly reminiscent of some of Webster's most characteristic moments, in tone, in subject-matter, in imagery, and in language. By the same token, it does not strike us at all like Shirley, in any of his moods. Professor Richard Morton, also of McMaster University, whose reputation as a Shirley specialist is second to none, was kind enough to comment on this question for us. The characteristic features of the scene are its richly allusive (one might say uncontrollably allusive) and figurative style and its eagerness to find sudden tonal shifts within the episode. Both are most uncharacteristic of Shirley, whose style tends to the placid and who, when he wants to intrude a bit of comic variation, does the decent thing and introduces a comic servant. . . . A further characteristic of the MS is its "rugged" versification [which] is far from Shirley's smoothness (Shirley being a very Waller among playwrights). I would say that given the text as it is, Shirley is one of the last playwrights one would think of as author. There remains the question of its relationship to Act I scene ii of The Traitor . Clearly it is the same lazzo —that is, the episode has the same narrative and character elements. . . . I do not see in the scene any clues that suggest that Shirley was writing with the MS in front of him, or that he was "play-doctoring" it. The two scenes seem to me quite different in intent and effect. Shirley's scene uses the letter as the basis for a formal, almost academic display of rhetorical technique by the putative traitor. The MS uses the occasion for a complex interchange between two equally interesting characters. Shirley keeps on stage a commenting crew of other courtiers (to help the audience figure out what is going on—a characteristic device) whereas the MS isolates the two central figures and thus builds up a strong emotional force out of moving topics such as trust, betrayal, loyalty and love, a force painfully delayed by Lorenzo's embittered comic turn. Shirley, at the beginning of his play, does not want an emotional peak; instead he provides a set-piece of rhetorical and political manipulation. The two scenes seem to me very different; I could not agree that the one is a draft—or, in a more serious way, a source—for the other. 41 By now it seems evident to us that Shapiro's claim for Shirley's authorship of the MS cannot be accepted. Nor, indeed, are any of the other well-known Jacobean dramatists, with the possible exceptions of Marston and Middleton, plausible nominees for authorship on stylistic grounds; and neither of these seems as likely a candidate as Webster. (Both are ruled out by their handwriting in any event). Marston can at least be seen as an influence on the author of the MS (Pryor remarks on it in support of his urging of Webster's authorship), and of course everybody knows that Webster wrote the Induction for The Malcontent when the King's Men performed it in 1604. That much of Marston's style rubbed off on Webster is also a truism; one of the most characteristic products of this influence being the malcontent figure himself: witty, learned, discontented, defensive, changeable in mood and manner. Flamineo in The White Devil and Bosola in The Dutchesse of Malfy are the two great malcontents of Webster's plays. It is clear that Lorenzo in the MS shares all these qualities with them, and that his verbal style is, as Pryor rightly remarked, similar to both these famous figures. Therein, of course, lies the rub: they were famous (Bosola, at least, was a figure in a successful play, and any budding author would have had access to the text of The White Devil , even if he had not seen it), and therefore meet subjects for imitation. But if the MS were written by an author in imitation of Webster's malcontent-style, the imitation is certainly extremely well done. 42 The Prince in the MS is certainly a much less vivid figure, obliged to play the straight man to the protean Lorenzo. Yet as a glance at I.ii of The White Devil (our sample comparison scene) will show, even the mercurial Brachiano was obliged to be rather stick-like when Flamineo was at his most inventive. Like Brachiano at a later point, the Prince boasts of his valor in ll. 8-16; 43 but as his role is essentially passive, it is difficult to find any particular precedent for him. Other plays and playwrights are suggested by the scene to a greater or lesser degree. The scene in Beaumont's The Maid's Tragedy , in which Melantius denies his treason, as well as the plot of that play as a whole (the relation of brothers and sisters to the tyrannical king, for instance) has some resemblance to the MS, and The Revenger's Tragedy and Marston's Fawn have some obvious parallels. Most strikingly, there is an allusion in ll. 137-138 of the MS to Sejanus: this reference could, of course, perfectly well be to the historical figure. Nonetheless, the fact that Jonson's play was printed in 1605 makes it a likelier source for any allusion in another play, especially in view of the line from Sejanus , "By IOVE, I am not OEDIPVS inough, | To vnderstand this SPHYNX" (III, 64-65), which (though an entirely commonplace image) may have suggested the MS's "Not alle the witt I am Commander of | Can make me a wise Oedipus and unvolve | The mysterie of your Sphinx". 44 It is striking that all the works which seem to have influenced the MS date from earlier than 1610. This need mean nothing in particular, but such as it is, it suggests an earlier rather than a later date for the MS. We would like to conclude this necessarily inconclusive section by noting a few of the ways the MS seems to us characteristic of Webster, not claiming that any of these "prove" anything about the attribution; merely that they struck us and that they are worthy of mention. The most obvious of these is, of course the unusual image of the Jacob's staff, which Flamineo alluded to in our sample scene from The White Devil , and which Webster used again in Monuments of Honor ("navigation with a Jacobs staffe and compasse", l. 325). 45 Lorenzo uses the image here in the context of a speech which the most sceptical must agree is in tone and manner very like Flamineo's. Weare it ath' old fashion, let your large eares come through, it will be more easy, nay I will be bitter, barre your wife of her entertaynment: women are more willinglie &amp; gloriouslie chast, when they are least restrayned of their libertie. It seemes you would be a fine Capricious Mathematically jealous Coxcombe, take the height of your owne hornes with a Jacobs staffe afore they are up. ( The White Devil , I.ii. 89-95) What are you leane Epictetus; or have you read Boetius de Consolatione or els Catos sentences; well: it is a Commendable thing in a Prince, I hope you will in tyme write bookes, that the whole world may laugh at you? Yf you growe bookish we must all turn schollers, and every one buie his horne booke; marry those who are wedded may obtaine such volumes by deed of guift without troubling the stationer; When dionisius studied Geometrie, there was not a Courtier but walkd with his Jacobs staffe. (ll. 26-34) Webster was very fond of personifying death, generally in a stoical context. Vittoria proudly claims "I shall wellcome death | As Princes doe some great Embassadors; | Ile meete thy weapon halfe way" ( White Devil , V.vi.220-222); in the same scene Zanche has a similar response, and the stoical greeting of death by the Duchess of Malfy is very well-known. In the MS, the Prince proudly proclaims, "Why yf death weare here | And sett wide ope his jawes I would not shune | The chamber for the grizlie monsters Companie" (ll. 8-10). An image-association of death, soldiers and danger is also found often enough in Webster; it occurs in the MS in ll. 11-16. Treason and its unnatural character is a regular, if hardly exclusive, Websterian key, which in his imagery is often associated with physical disease or with poisonous creatures: "Keepe off idle questions; Treason's tongue hath a villainous palsy" ( White Devil , III.ii.317); "You may be brothers, for treason, like the Plague, | Doth take much in a blood" ( Dutchesse of Malfy , IV.ii.348-349); "Treason, like spiders weaving nets for flies | By her foule worke is found, and in it dies" ( White Devil , IV.i.28-29). These may be compared with the MS: "Can horrid Treason, which for intrailes hath | The bowels of a serpent, and Converts | Into burnt choler what eare he eates" . . . (ll. 35-37). Role-playing is another Webster commonplace (again of course not exclusive to him). The MS's "sett such a face of harmlesse mirth on it" (l. 39) may be compared with "What appears in him mirth, is merely outside" ( Dutchesse of Malfy , I.i.170) and "To put on this feigned garbe of mirth" ( White Devil , III.i.30). The stage-directions of the MS reflect two Websterian modes: the business with the letter, for instance, reminds us that Webster regularly used this stage-device; more significantly, the tone of the direction "Hee reades the Prince attentively marking him" reminds us of the descriptive character of a direction such as "Francisco speakes this as in scorne" ( White Devil , III.ii.50), not to mention a number of instances in the dumb-shows in both tragedies (e.g. "Enter suspiciously, Julio and Christophero", "Sorrow exprest in Giovanni and in Count Lodovico" (both White Devil ), or "in Friers habits, as having bin at the Bathanites" ( Devils Law-case , V.ii.12). Other practices worthy of brief note are such things as Webster's fondness for the use of "why" at the beginning of a phrase (there is a long list in the concordance); two such usages turn up in the MS: "why I hope ffavorites may runne in debt" (ll. 50-51), and "why yf these things should goe by compulsion" (l. 65). Other such usages are "I could wish", which occurs in the MS at l. 76, or the formation of a verb from "to grow" plus an adjective; here "growe wearie" (l. 111); or there is the rhetorical figure of parison: "there are not jewes enough, priests enough, nor gentlemen enough" ( White Devil , III.iii.40); compare the MS's "it shalbe comfort enough, and honor enough" (ll. 66-67). At another level are what might be called "Websterian words", such as "intelligencers", already mentioned, "abhominable" (l. 80, also in White Devil, Devils Law-case, Characters ), or Webster's favourite round number, a thousand (ll. 110, 127; there are 47 uses in the concordance), or the ubiquitous word "devil" (variously spelled) which turns up in the MS as "devill" in l. 113—as good a point as any to stop. Doubtless, many of these usages could be paralleled in other Jacobean dramatists. This is not the point, at this stage of the discussion. Rather, the point is that the MS shares with Webster's work elements of style, tone, manner, verbal usage and vocabulary. And by the same token there is very little in the MS which either of us feel is entirely uncharacteristic of Webster. Such an impressionistic judgement is not, of course, offered as any kind of evidence concerning the authorship of the MS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion We feel that it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions from these studies. To summarize, we have here a MS written in the first quarter of the seventeenth century, by an author who was almost certainly a professional dramatist, whose handwriting ( pace Shapiro) cannot be identified with any of the dramatists whose hands are known, who could write very much in Webster's vein, and who used a great number of expressions and images that Webster employed, who was a well-read man, and a careful, even finicky author. If this author was not John Webster, we would like to know who else meets all these conditions. We mean the question seriously, for if any of Webster's contemporaries were able to do all this, it would be valuable to know it. None of the known dramatists seems at all likely as a candidate, but of course we cannot, on that basis alone, rule anyone out. The number of professional dramatists of whose work nothing survives declines sharply in the Jacobean period, and we do not find it plausible to attribute this MS to an unknown. Our conclusion, bearing all the evidence in mind, is that the attribution to Webster is not impossible, and indeed that the evidence for his authorship is a good deal stronger than that for some of the works which have been attributed in part to him in the past. The Cambridge Webster will, for want of convincing contrary evidence, include some of these doubtful collaborative texts; it will also include, as a "possible" work, the Melbourne Manuscript fragment.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 We would like to thank Lord and Lady Lothian, Lord Ralph Kerr, Lord John Kerr, Professor Richard Proudfoot, Professor Richard Morton, Mr. Osman Azis and Mr. Felix Pryor for their various help in the work that went into preparing this article. Thanks are also due to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for their financial support, to the Huntington Library, and to Mrs. L. Leclair, the librarian of Worcester College, for her special assistance. The facsimiles of the manuscript are reproduced with the kind permission of Lady Lothian and the Melbourne Garden Charities, who also gave permission for the transcription printed in the Appendix to this article to be made. 2 Mr. Pryor has described the finding of the MS and the processes which led him to attribute it to Webster in an article, "From Packet 3 to 'The Duke of Florence'", in The Spectator , 14 June 1986, pp. 34-35. Coke's very extensive correspondence was calendared by William Dashwood Fane for the Historical Manuscripts Commission, who docketed this particular piece of paper as belonging to "Packet 3" (which contained correspondence by Coke dating between 1601 and 1630, and Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke's household accounts for 1602-03), but did not otherwise remark on it. 3 "A Jacobean dramatic fragment", TLS , 13 June 1986, p. 651. Proudfoot is careful in this piece not to endorse Pryor's claim that the MS is Webster's, though he does not reject it either. 4 TLS , 4 July 1986, pp. 735-736. 5 TLS , 18 July 1986, p. 787. 6 TLS , 22 August, 1986, pp. 913-914. Proudfoot objects to some of Shapiro's palaeographical arguments in this letter, concluding "Much, then, as I should like to accept Mr Shapiro's attractive conjecture, I cannot share his confidence that the evidence points unequivocally towards it." 7 It is true that in some ways the Book of Sir Thomas More is "foul", but only in a special sense—namely that it contains newly drafted passages designed to overcome censorship problems. It cannot be considered a "classic" foul papers, defined by Bowers ( On Editing Shakespeare [1966], p. 13) as "the author's last complete draft in a shape satisfactory to him to be transferred to a fair copy". 8 Sketched, the watermark looks like the attached illustration. It is similar to Nos. 12790-92 in Briquet, but not identical (these watermarks have only one handle to the pot). A (necessarily cursory) search through Coke's correspondence at Melbourne failed to reveal any identical paper. We were not, of course, expecting to find any, but it seemed worth while taking a look just in case: since Coke's correspondence is often carefully dated, it might have helped to have established some dating limits for the MS had a dated letter been written on the same paper. 9 Pryor, in his sale-catalogue for Bloomsbury Book Auctions, refers on pp. 11-12 to Bernardo Segni's Storie Fiorentine , which, though it was not published until 1723, was written in the sixteenth century, and circulated in manuscript form. This work could have provided the author of the MS with Lorenzo's double-bluff defence of himself; it also is one of the texts which stress Lorenzo's erudition. Other possible sources include the fifty-fourth "novell", "The Incontinence of a Duke and his Impudencie to Attain his Purpose", in William Painter's translation of the Heptameron , The Palace of Pleasure (which however does not name the characters). Some more detailed account of Florentine history, Segni's or another, must have been used for these details. A good concise account of the sources for The Traitor is found in John Stewart Carter's edition of the play (Regents Renaissance Drama, 1965). 10 The word "grizlie" was also altered at some stage. For ease of discussion, the conventional modifications of the MS's i/j and u/v are made throughout this article, and abbreviations are silently expanded. The transcript of the MS in the Appendix, however, is diplomatic. 11 A small, but telling piece of evidence for date: such a correction is much more likely to have occurred to an author after 1606. Too much weight cannot be attached to this, however, since "'slide" appears only five lines down. 12 "An intimate private friend, confidant; the favourite of a ruler." ( OED ) We are grateful to Professor Shapiro for supplying us with the correct reading of this word. 13 He says of these speeches, "They are written in a style which had no imitators" (Catalogue, p. 7), but this is not true. In the disputed play The Honest Man's Fortune there are several such passages, which read very much in this vein. However, Cyrus Hoy has decisively rejected J. W. Gerritsen's opinion that Webster had a hand in this play: the passages in question are in parts of the play that Professor Hoy attributes to Nathan Field. See "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (IV)", Studies in Bibliography , 12 (1959), 91-116, especially 100-108 and 114. 14 There is one exception: a suggestive point raised concerning an otherwise obscure piece of dramaturgy in The White Devil . Zanche, Vittoria's Moorish maid, has no source so far as her name, race, or sexual enthusiasm are concerned. Pryor points out that Alessandro was known as "Il Moro" because his mother was (reputedly) a mulatto Moorish serving woman. Webster was undoubtedly interested in the misdoings of the Medici family, and, if he were the author of the MS, the association of the family with the Moors might well have suggested these aspects of Zanche, as well as Francisco's (historically improbable) disguise as Mulinassar the Moor in the latter acts of the play. To be sure, Webster could have obtained this information from his reading about the Medicis; in other words, he did not need to write the MS in order to develop these points. But if he had written a play about Alessandro Il Moro, it is plausible that the Moorish connexion would have continued vivid in his mind for his next play about the Medicis. However, this argument depends upon the assumption that the MS pre-dates The White Devil . 15 Private communications. As noted above (note 3), Proudfoot has neither endorsed nor contradicted the ascription to Webster; in his response to Shapiro (see note 6) he declines, on palaeographical grounds, to accept Shapiro's attribution of the MS to Shirley, but does not make any alternative suggestion concerning authorship. 16 Bodl. MS. Rawlinson Poet. 28, stanza 70; see G. E. Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage , V, 1245. 17 It is worth observing that the censor might well have found fault with the material of the scene. For instance, Lorenzo's satirical dismissal of princes who "growe bookish" would very likely have seemed offensive to King James, who fancied himself a scholar; and Lorenzo's scornful rejection of the claims of mistresses upon a royal favourite (ll. 59-70) would not have been tactful during the years of Buckingham's excesses, or shortly thereafter. However, the MS is foul papers, and one cannot say what milder version of these passages might have ended up in the book, when it was ready to be submitted to the Master of the Revels. And one could, without much difficulty, find equally opprobrious passages in the performed and printed works of such dramatists as Marston, Middleton, and Webster himself. Thus although it is possible that trouble with the censor might have prevented the MS from being staged in its present form, on the basis of this fragment alone it is far from a certainty. 18 TLS , 4 July 1986, p. 736. 19 Ibid . 20 Professor Proudfoot's (privately communicated) opinion is that it is likely to be later rather than earlier. The fact that the author capitalized the first word of most verse-lines suggests a later date, but is not a sure guide: there are manuscripts with this feature before 1600, though its universal adoption came later. 21 See below for a further treatment of this question. 22 Miss Mary Edmond, whose researches last decade put the biography of Webster on an entirely new footing, and whose expertise in reading the handwriting of documents of the period is unquestionable, wrote to Lord John Kerr disputing Professor Shapiro's assertion that the MS's handwriting was Shirley's. Unfortunately her letter was not intended for publication. 23 Trois Masques a la cour de Charles I er d'Angleterre: The Triumph of Peace , The Triumphs of the Prince d'Amour, Britannia Triumphans .

Petti, English Literary Hands from Chaucer to Dryden (1977), pp. 20-21, for a brief discussion of the historical development of round hand from the earlier forms. 25 Worcester College MS 120 (Plays 9.21), where it is labelled on the binding Don Manuel . 26 There are interpolations on fols. 6 r and 21 r in a different, vertically-oriented secretary hand; there are also some printed words e.g. on fol. 23 v . None of these seems to be Shirley's. See Howarth's articles in RES , 7 (1931), 302-313 and 8 (1932), 203. 27 Unfortunately, one of the longest additions, on fol. 15 r , is written vertically in the margin, and the letters are so squeezed as to make them unreliable as evidence. 28 A Concordance to the Works of John Webster , prepared by Richard Cornballis and J. M. Harding.

R. Brown, "The Printing of John Webster's Plays (I)," Studies in Bibliography , 6 (1954), pp. 117-128 for the most complete summary so far in print concerning the nature of the copy for The White Devil . Brown concludes that some features of the text are best explained by postulating that the copy was foul papers, or at least that it was an authorial manuscript. 31 See Antony Hammond, " The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop", Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 135-176, in which the naive Compositor N was first distinguished from the two more sophisticated Compositors A and B. * "pottle" occurs in A Cure for a Cuckold , sig. F1 r 32 That the author of the MS actively preferred verbal nouns can be seen in l. 69, where "expectation" has been changed to "expecting". 33 Proudfoot, in his TLS article (13 June 1986, p. 651), observed the frequency of these doubled final consonants. Interestingly (as Professor Shapiro has remarked to us), these are a feature of some of Shirley's manuscripts: there is a large number of them in the Rawlinson, for instance, but of those we noticed, only "sett" "lett" and "gett" are common to the Rawlinson and the MS, and "upp", so spelled in Rawlinson, is "up" in the MS. In the 1646 printed text of the Shirley's Poems , most of these doubled consonants are singled, as one would expect. Thus "Sinn" becomes "Sin", "Penn", "pen", "upp", "up", and so forth. Too much cannot be made of this, since the Rawlinson manuscript was most certainly not the copy for the 1646 edition, but the fact that Shirley, writing his poems, doubled his final consonants frequently, and Humphrey Moseley's compositor, typesetting them, did not, illustrates the point made in the next paragraph about the MS, that such old-fashioned features in printer's copy were among the first candidates for regularization. 34 It would be of great interest to perform a similar comparison of the MS's vocabulary and spelling with Shirley's dramatic work. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no concordance to Shirley. 35 But see the transcription in the Appendix to this article, note 15. 36 For a discussion of the punctuation of The White Devil , see Hammond, op. cit. , pp. 142-144. 37 One instance, of great interest to the Cambridge edition of Webster, is that the MS agrees with the early gatherings of The White Devil in frequently failing to provide terminal punctuation at the end of speeches, or in punctuating them other than with a period. 38 Hoy, loc. cit . 39 The "'s" form for "his" (as in "in's" and other such combinations) does not yield readily to a search in the concordance, and has been omitted in this article. 40 At this point it is important to note that the MS also lacks any of Shirley's most common linguistic habits: his penchant for such formulations as "ha'", "sha'not" and "shan-not", "shat" (="shalt"), "wo'", "wo't" and "wot", "wo'not" and "wonnot", and "d'ee", which are highly idiosyncratic features of his style (see Hoy, op. cit. , pp. 108-110); none of these is to be found in the MS. While on the subject, it is worth noting that the MS does not use Field's most familiar linguistic forms: "ye", an even preference for "them" and "'em", and, like Shirley, a fondness for the contraction "d'ee". 41 Private communication to Antony Hammond, reproduced here with permission and with our thanks. There are three possible explanations of the similarity in subject-matter between the MS and The Traitor : first, as Shapiro proposes, that the MS is a draft by Shirley, which he discarded virtually completely when he came to re-compose the scene in The Traitor . For all the reasons expressed in this article, we cannot accept this option as a satisfactory explanation. Secondly, there is Pryor's view, which is that Shirley actually used the MS as a source for The Traitor . Morton gives good reasons for doubting that this was the case, but we feel that it is not impossible that Shirley was aware of the MS, that its existence may have prompted him to write his very different version of the scene in The Traitor . There is no way of knowing whether this happened, nor any way of telling whether Shirley knew any more of the play of which the MS is a fragment than this single sheet. The third possibility is that the two works are independent: that both derive from the same or similar sources, but that otherwise there is no direct connexion between them. There are enough instances of Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists duplicating play-subjects for this scenario to be plausible. For it to be demonstrated , a much more extensive exploration of source-materials would have to be undertaken. 42 This is not meant to say that such a successful imitation is impossible: as was noted earlier, Field could write a convincing pastiche of this style. But as we have seen, Field is not a plausible candidate as author of the MS. 43 Cf. The White Devil , II.i. 44 Pryor points out that Lorenzo also declares that he has "putt on the Person of sinon" (ll. 142-143), and that Arruntius in Sejanus alludes to the same individual. It is also worth nothing parenthetically that Oedipus is one of the few classical allusions made in the MS that also occurs in Webster ( White Devil , V.i. 197-200). 45 A Jacob's staff was a forerunner of the sextant, a simple instrument used for taking the altitude of the sun, or for surveying purposes. It seems to us significant that in the two examples quoted the instrument should be mentioned in the same context as mathematics ( Devil ), and geometry (MS).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The ampersand is written over "my". 2 "chamber" is written over "roome"; "for" is written over "nor". 3 The word has been altered. 4 The pen was re-dipped in the middle of the word. 5 The word seems to have been altered. 6 The cancellation of "death" was inadvertently extended into "for". 7 The initial T was originally begun as another letter. 8 "And" was written over "But" (we think), and "Can" was written over something else. 9 "What" written over "Nay". 10 Reading uncertain. 11 The s in this word looks as if it were added later. By oversight, the following "eare" was not cancelled. 12 Probable reading. The word may be "suspecting", but if so it has the shortest initial s in the MS. "Inspecting" (=introspective) makes good sense. 13 The word "not" (which originally began with an l) ought to have been cancelled. 14 Probably an abbreviation for "against"; if so, the author no doubt intended to write "against him", but ran out of room at the end of the line and overlooked the necessary pronoun. Professor Shapiro suggests the abbreviation may be for 'a p ar t'; the second letter may indeed be a p written to indicate abbreviation. If so, no pronoun would be missing, though the phrase is not exactly a common one. 15 It is just possible that the "are actually a double beginning to the capital T. 16 The e in this word is written over something else. 17 There are five minims in the word; minim-errors are common enough for us to be certain that "runne" was the intended word. 18 A correction; may have originally read "forcd" 19 A correction. 20 The word "be(e)" has been inadvertently omitted. 21 Word corrected. 22 "fealing" written over "falling". 23 The word originally written was "this". 24 This was begun as another word. 25 Word corrected. 26 Overwritten. 27 This is not a stage-direction, but the last word of Lorenzo's sentence, which could not be squeezed in at the foot of fol. 1 v . The word could be taken as "reads", palaeographically; there is a marked downward tail to the d. But terminal d made with such a final hook is not uncommon in the MS: cf. "should", l. 1; "world", l. 29, and "Oppressed", l. 38, in order of increasing size of the flourish. 28 The "I" written over "y r ." 29 The th written over the ue. 30 "of" written over "is". 31 The word originally began as something else. 32 The l is written over another letter. 33 The l is written over another letter. 34 "hande" is re-created out of a word's whole first letter (under the a) was an l. 35 The line originally began "Lor. why [or] my". Over the second word, "what" was then written, then the word was cancelled. Over "Lor.", "mee" was written. 36 The word may be "Alexander": cf. l. 108. 37 The reading is a guess. 38 Altered from another word. 39 "proue" written over "show". 40 Written over "much", abandoned before the h was finished. 41 Apparent reading. 42 Altered from "that". 43 Altered from "that". 44 "wealth" written over "world". 45 In this word the t has been altered. 46 The C written over the pr. 47 Letters 2-5 of this word altered.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Bibliographical History As a Field of Study by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of scholarship has long been a recognized subject of inquiry in certain disciplines. One thinks immediately of J. E. Sandys's A History of Classical Scholarship (1903-8), Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff's Geschichte der Philologie (1921), and Rudolf Pfeiffer's History of Classical Scholarship (1968-76) and of the considerable body of other work in this area. 1 Scholarship is of course a cultural activity, and the historical study of it forms a natural part of the intellectual history of any period or country. In practice, however, it is sometimes neglected in such histories, perhaps out of a feeling that it is derivative, not primary. But a distinction between creative work and scholarship cannot be maintained, for every effort to establish past events—however disciplined by what are taken to be responsible ways of handling evidence—is a creative act, involving judgments at each step. The same observation applies to the attempt at distinguishing criticism from creative work (and from scholarship). Literary critics (who are not necessarily concerned with history) have occasionally argued that their own writings are on a par with the literature they are ostensibly discussing. Surely, however, the worth of a piece depends on individual performance, not genre: some scholarly or critical essays are indeed more valuable and inspiring than some poems. All verbal works are instances of human creativity, and any of them can reveal how individuals in the past have viewed their own world and their inheritance. I need not belabor the point: the history of scholarship is a significant branch of historical study. Some scholarly fields have had longer histories than others, and it is natural that the younger fields are less likely than the older ones to have been the subject of extensive historical investigation. American literature, for example, did not become an accepted field of academic study until well into the twentieth century, and the history of the field has not yet been vigorously pursued. 2 An encouraging sign, however, was the establishment in 1976 of the Jay B. Hubbell Center for American Literary Historiography at Duke University, which now holds the papers of a number of prominent scholars of American literature as well as the archives of relevant organizations (such as the American Literature Section of the Modern Language Association of America). 3 It is to be hoped that this development will serve as a stimulus to the creation of similar centers in other fields. Bibliography is a field deserving of more historical study than it has received, and a gathering of appropriate materials would no doubt encourage further work. Although the listing of books is an ancient activity, the examination of the physical evidence in books was rarely undertaken until relatively recent times. Bradshaw's work in the third quarter of the nineteenth century has rightly caused him to be regarded as the father of modern analytical bibliography, and the writings of Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg, beginning about the turn of the century, established the importance of bibliographical evidence for the editing of post-medieval literature. The emergence of analytical and descriptive bibliography as recognizable fields is therefore essentially a twentieth-century phenomenon. What this kind of bibliography has achieved is even now frequently misunderstood; but it has such far-reaching consequences for all who read that its story ought to be considered an important chapter in intellectual history. I should like to offer here some reflections on bibliographical history as a field and some indication of what material is available to build on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The various kinds of scholarly endeavor often referred to as "bibliography" are interrelated, and the history of any one of them necessarily impinges on the history of the others. But they represent such diverse activities that they have usually been taken up separately. The history of the listing of books, insofar as it is concerned with listings by subject, is primarily a part of the history of the study of each of those subjects. Trends in such listings, however, along with general considerations of the principles underlying the listing of books, do merit consolidated historical treatment, constituting the history of what is traditionally called "enumerative bibliography" (and has also been called, appropriately, "reference bibliography"). 4 Significant historical work has in fact been accomplished in this area, the best-known examples perhaps being Georg Schneider's Theory and History of Bibliography (translated by Ralph R. Shaw in 1934 from the 1926 edition of the 1923 work), Theodore Besterman's The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography (1935; 3rd edition, in French, 1950), the books of Archer Taylor ( Renaissance Guides to Books , 1945; A History of Bibliographies of Bibliographies , 1955; Book Catalogues: Their Varieties and Uses , 1957 [revised by William P. Barlow, Jr., 1986]; General Subject-Indexes since 1548 , 1966), Sears Jayne's Library Catalogues of the English Renaissance (1956), and Rudolf Blum's "Bibliographia: Eine wort- und begriffsgeschichtliche Untersuchung" ( Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens , 10 [1970], cols. 1010-1246). 5 D. W. Krummel's Bibliographies: Their Aims and Methods (1984) is not only a thoughtful statement in its own right, which will have an important place in any future history of book listing, but also a basic source for the literature of the subject; 6 and the Grolier Club's exhibition catalogue of the same year, Bibliography: Its History and Development by Bernard H. Breslauer and Roland Folter, records the landmark lists that would have to form the basis of any history of the field. Some lists focus more on books as physical objects than on books as conveyors of information; and although the two approaches are not always distinguished in works on bibliographical enumeration, they represent fundamentally different impulses. Even so, a single list can obviously involve both, as when the scope of a list is determined by subject matter and the form of the entries by attention to the identification of editions and impressions. One class of lists concerned principally with books as printed items, not as transmitters of texts, consists of what are often called "imprint lists" or "imprint bibliographies"—that is, lists that attempt to record all printed matter (or all in certain categories) produced within a given geographical area during a particular period of time. Even when such lists contain entries with no physical details, what underlies them is as much an interest in printing and publishing history as in the history of ideas, and those lists are thus relevant to the story of the development of analytical and descriptive bibliography. The famous Short-Title Catalogue of pre-1641 English books, though it tries to keep physical details to a minimum, is a work of physical bibliography, aiming to differentiate editions; and its history is tied up with the history of the Bibliographical Society in London, a society interested in the history of books, not in the production of lists. Similarly, the list now usually called "Goff," recording copies of incunabula in American libraries, has played a major role in the history of the publications of the Bibliographical Society of America. Thus the history of those reference works that take books (rather than works) as their concern forms a branch of bibliographical history distinct from the history of subject lists. But it is not a branch that has been much pursued. Some such works—like the STC itself—include accounts of their own history, 7 and a few essays exist that are useful in tracing the history of these works (principally pieces by those associated with the projects, such as W. A. Jackson and Katharine F. Pantzer on the STC , and Donald Wing and Robin Alston on the short-title catalogues for 1641-1700 and 1701-1800). 8 Furthermore, library catalogues, however minimal their entries, are guides to—and consist of information drawn from—particular copies of books, and they constitute another category of reference work that is of direct concern to those interested in physical bibliography. But for this category, too, there is only a meager historical literature (aside from the books of Taylor and Jayne on early catalogues): the British Museum library catalogue has been best served, with work by Barbara McCrimmon and A. H. Chaplin, and David A. Smith has written well on the National Union Catalog: Pre-1956 Imprints ; there has also been some examination, especially by Dorothy May Norris and Gertrude London, of the history of cataloguing practice. 9 Further historical studies of these kinds of reference works are to be encouraged; the results will be important not only for the history of libraries and of information control but also for the history of the development of bibliographical analysis and description. 10 If the history of bibliography deals not with the history of books but with the historiography of that history, with the story of how that history has been pursued, then the history of libraries might be considered not strictly part of it. For the purchasing and the collecting of books by institutions are—like the production of books by printers and the dissemination of them by publishers and booksellers—stages in the life cycle of books, from the origin of their texts in writers' minds to the reading of those texts by persons who encounter the books. This cycle, from beginning to end (the end often enough leading to a new beginning), is the subject matter of the history of books. Nevertheless, librarians, who naturally influence the course of the history of libraries and collecting, are also scholars of the book: they are part of book history themselves, and in addition they are students of that history. Indeed, the history of all scholarship that involves the use of books is ultimately tied to the history of books (and therefore of libraries). I. R. Willison, in his lecture On the History of Libraries and Scholarship (1980), makes a similar point, observing—and welcoming—a growing recognition of "the historical interdependence of libraries and scholarship" (p. 7). John P. Feather and David McKitterick have reinforced this position in their lectures printed as The History of Books and Libraries: Two Views (1986), the former pointing out that "the history of libraries is . . . part of the larger subject of book history" (p. 14) and the latter concluding, "Far from being divorced from other parts of bibliographical study, the history of libraries is essential to it" (p. 30). It is thus fruitless to try to enforce a sharp dividing line between the history of books and the history of bibliography. But the distinction may still be useful as a framework for thought: it may help one to see, for example, that the biographical study of librarians may often contribute as much to the history of bibliography as to the history of the management of libraries (as much, that is, to the history of the study of books as to the history of the collecting of books). Cases in point are the biographical accounts of Henry Bradshaw, Francis Jenkinson, J. Y. W. MacAlister, A. W. Pollard, W. A. Jackson, and A. N. L. Munby. 11 However one assesses these shifting relationships, the history of libraries, unlike the history of bibliographical reference books, is a well-established field, with its own journals ( Journal of Library History [1966- ] and Library History [1967- ]) and professional colloquia (such as the Library History Round Table of the American Library Association). 12 Its monographic literature includes many well-known broad surveys 13 and many distinguished histories of individual libraries; 14 and some guides to published research in the field have been assembled. 15 But despite the presence of a large literature of library history, the kind of integrated historical work that Willison, Feather, and McKitterick call for is still at its beginnings. These points about the relation of library history to bibliographical history can be duplicated for the history of the antiquarian book trade and the history of collecting by individuals—in a way that they could not be for the history of printing or typefounding or papermaking or binding. Printers, typefounders, papermakers, and binders may also happen to be scholars, but their role in the cycle of book history is connected with the physical production of books, not with receiving or responding to finished books. 16 Dealers and collectors, however—though they, too, play a role in book history—deal with the completed object; and their manner of approaching it makes them bibliographical scholars, in one degree or another, in the very process of carrying out their function in the history of a book. Publishers fall in between, controlling production but also handling completed books. 17 Biographies and autobiographies of dealers and collectors (and often of publishers) are therefore contributions at once to book history and to bibliographical history. Broader historical studies of the book trade and of collecting may of course lean in one of these directions rather than the other, but in either case they remain, by the nature of their subject, a mixture of both. One does not normally think of the historical works on bookselling or on collectors and collecting 18 as studies of bibliographical history. But the greatest broad works in this area—such as John Carter's Taste &amp; Technique in Book-Collecting (1948) and Graham Pollard and Albert Ehrman's The Distribution of Books by Catalogue from the Invention of Printing to A.D. 1800 (1965)—can readily be regarded as making direct contributions to the history of bibliography, for the authors' own interest in the analysis of book structure and their understanding of the importance of bibliographical evidence inform their discussions. 19 In 1977 I attempted to provide a guide to the literature of book collecting, 20 and one can see from a perusal of that essay the extent to which the relevant material can also be considered bibliographical history. The work that bibliographical scholars do, after all, is one of the ways in which books can be used; and those scholars can therefore be seen, along with other readers (and dealers, librarians, and collectors), as an element in the world of books. Viewed in this way, the history of bibliographical scholarship is simply one part of the history of books. How one finally decides to relate bibliographical history to book history and to delimit the activities subsumed under the two terms is less important than having a clear idea of the considerations involved. Historical studies relating to books need not be conceived of as falling into only one of these categories, but writers of them ought to have given thought to the fact that their subjects do involve the intermingling of two separate strands. Scholarship, being historical, is by nature retrospective; but it moves forward through its use of the past and is part of the stream of history. To understand that booksellers and librarians and collectors participate in this double view can only enrich our studies of them, whether we call the results contributions to the history of the reception of books or to the history of bibliographical scholarship. I raise these points not to encourage compartmentalization but to provide a context for thinking about the history of what may be considered the central core of bibliographical study, the part dealing with physical analysis. These other areas are unquestionably parts of bibliographical activity in the broadest sense, and the investigation of the course of their growth merits strong encouragement. But I wish to concentrate here on physical bibliography, which has received far less historical attention and which is central in that all uses of books as conveyors of information presuppose some attitude toward the physicality of books as artifacts. Those who make lists of books and those who sell and buy and read books do not always think through their position on this matter, but the way in which they pursue their work does nevertheless imply a position. Physical bibliography directly confronts the physical evidence in books, working out methods of analysis to reveal information about how books were produced and then assessing the implications of that information for classifying books (in relation to other books purporting to represent the same works) and for establishing texts (understanding how the texts in books have been affected by the means of their production). The development of this kind of analytical bibliography, and of the descriptive bibliography and textual criticism that build on it, is one of the remarkable stories in the history of twentieth-century scholarship. A relatively small number of people have been actively involved in this work, however; and, despite the efforts of some of them to explain its significance to a wide audience, most people who use books (including many of those who regard themselves as scholars) do not understand the field or its relevance to their own interests. One should perhaps not be surprised, therefore, that the history of the field has not been much investigated. But further attention to it would be valuable not only as a contribution to the history of scholarship but also as a way of clarifying the nature of the field for readers who are not specialists. When one thinks about what work of this kind already exists, one is likely to name first the volume published by the Bibliographical Society (London) on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary— The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942: Studies in Retrospect (1945). This excellent collection of ten essays (edited by F. C. Francis) is a particularly fitting product of the Society's jubilee, for the Society was at the heart of the new developments in bibliography in England during the first half of the twentieth century, and the volume provides the best account yet written of the bibliographical history of that period. 21 Besides an essay by F. C. Francis on the history of the Society itself and an important statement by W. W. Greg setting forth a conception of the field that reflects its then-recent history ("Bibliography—A Retrospect"), there are assessments of the work on incunabula (by Victor Scholderer), STC books (F. S. Ferguson), Shakespeare (F. P. Wilson), the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Harold Williams and Michael Sadleir), foreign bibliography (Henry Thomas), and early bookbinding (E. P. Goldschmidt), and of bibliographical work in America (W. A. Jackson). The authors were prominent among those who had made the field what it was, and for this reason the volume is a primary document of importance to future historians; they were also scholars, and their essays display a mastery of the areas covered and a scrupulousness in forming generalizations. The work is not principally one of reminiscence but is an attempt to achieve a balanced view of the recent past, a perspective on activities in which the authors had been involved. Historians inevitably bring some predispositions to their reconstructions of the past, and first-generation historians may understandably bring more of them. Whether or not they in fact do varies from one individual to another, but personal involvement naturally plays a role. In his preface, F. C. Francis says of A. W. Pollard that "it was his genius to bring into the Society's life a personal element, a sense of common adventure, which has been one of its most valuable features and which I hope will never disappear from it" (p. vii). That "sense of common adventure" emerges repeatedly in the volume, as it does in many other writings by members of the circle—such as R. B. McKerrow's An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), which conveys the excitement of research, the exhilarating feeling of being on the brink of significant discoveries. Any historian who deals with this coterie of pioneers should of course aim at capturing the sense they had of opening up new frontiers; but there is no substitute for the way this frame of mind manifests itself in their own writings. The Studies in Retrospect volume is therefore unusual in being both primary documentation and scholarly history. As the former—and it is in fact a key document—it will obviously be of permanent use, regardless of how many other historical accounts are written. As the latter, it is worth citing here not because there is so little else to point to but because some of its essays are outstanding contributions to the history of scholarship and will remain so, no matter how excellent future treatments may prove to be. The volume offers us—as prospective historians of bibliography—a double model, encouraging us by example to write about our own immediate past in a scholarly way and demonstrating an approach to bibliographical history that is applicable to any period. The essays vary considerably in their achievement, but the most celebrated one—and rightly so—is F. P. Wilson's, entitled "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography.'" It is appropriate that his essay (by far the longest) should be the centerpiece of the volume, for his subject is central to the accomplishment of the Bibliographical Society in its first half-century: given the interests of Greg and McKerrow (and, through them, of Pollard), the application of physical evidence to textual problems was most extensively developed and demonstrated in connection with the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, particularly Shakespeare. Wilson's essay has fortunately reached a new audience through its republication in 1970 as a separate volume with a preface by Helen Gardner, who revised the text according to notes left by Wilson and added (in bracketed footnotes) some supplementary commentary of her own. In Wilson's essay, she says in her preface, "The story of the development of Shakespearian textual studies was narrated with a range and ease of reference that sprang from massive learning so fully digested that it never clogged the coherent progress of the narrative and the argument." The essay, she went on, "had the unmistakable note of authority that profound historical scholarship gives" (p. vi). By referring both to "narrative" and to "argument," she is calling attention to what makes historical writing profound. Narratives must be shaped; and the knowledge and insight that cause one to see connections, and enable one to assess previous contributions critically, produce the argument that gives narratives their power to illuminate. Another way of making the same point is provided by her statement that Wilson's essay is both "a contribution to the history of scholarship" and "a valuable introduction for anyone embarking on a study of the problems of establishing Shakespeare's text." Historical work at its best gives readers a view of the past that also instructs them in an approach to the subject under discussion. Wilson's essay was in fact a history of a field—the "new" bibliography (that is, analytical bibliography applied to textual problems)—not just a history of bibliographical and textual work on Shakespeare. Since the time of his essay there has been no similar effort to cover any field, or subfield, of bibliographical study. The paucity of work forces me now to allude to two pieces of my own. I do so not to suggest that they are models of any sort (least of all in comparison with Wilson's essay) but to emphasize how little work has been done and to underscore an approach for further writing. Both are addresses delivered on retrospective occasions, one for the fiftieth anniversary of the Osler Library in 1979 and the other for the centennial of the Grolier Club in 1984. 22 In each case the subject is primarily the development of physical bibliography in the twentieth century, encompassing bibliographical analysis and its use in descriptive bibliographies and critical editions. That each of these pieces covers, at a length appropriate to an address, an area broader than Wilson's indicates the sketchiness of the treatment. Yet what I tried to show were the main lines of change and the principal issues, as they appeared to me. In dealing with author bibliography, for example, I took as central the shift from a reliance on checklists that enumerate points for identification to a greater understanding of the role of descriptive bibliography as publishing history and biography; and I made clear that in my view this shift was a welcome one, away from casualness and oversimplification and toward serious history. 23 Whether or not one agrees with my emphases or my judgments, one will find that I have offered not only a view of the past but also a way of looking at the field and evaluating its products. It is this double concern that I wish to stress, not whatever merits or flaws my own work may have. I hope that others will proceed in this fashion and that we will not have to wait long before my two addresses are supplanted by more detailed accounts. The history of a field is to a large extent the biography of its leading figures, and biographical studies are thus an important genre within the history of scholarship. But here also there is little to point to for analytical bibliography, aside from reminiscences and memorial tributes. I do, however, wish to call attention to three essays, by Paul Needham, Fredson Bowers, and David L. Vander Meulen, that exemplify the qualities I am calling for. Needham's 1986 Hanes Lecture, The Bradshaw Method , examines Henry Bradshaw's contribution to the analysis and recording of the structure of books, reinforcing the often-expressed view that Bradshaw is the founder of modern analytical and descriptive bibliography. Far from being simply a confirmation of what was already known or believed, however, the lecture furnishes new details about the development of Bradshaw's thought, drawn from his notebooks in Cambridge University Library, and redefines the relation of Bradshaw's ideas to those of his successors. One of the remarkable, and exemplary, features of Needham's lecture is that it conveys with great skill a sense of Bradshaw as a person, even while it emphasizes (as the title indicates) Bradshaw's approach to examining books; in Needham's treatment, the two are inseparable. Furthermore, Needham's own mastery of the bibliographical analysis of incunables enables him to evaluate with sensitivity both Bradshaw's practice and its role (or neglect) in later research. When, for instance, he shows 24 that Bradshaw conceived the collational formula to record structure, not signings, he is at once praising Bradshaw's insight, criticizing the frequent misunderstanding of the formula by those who followed, and taking a position on what the formula ought to do. As he concisely says, Bradshaw's work "is not merely astonishing for the age to which it belongs, and worthy of respect and interest on that account. It is a reliable guide to how to study books." Needham's lecture, like Wilson's essay, shows that historical understanding and an informed view of how to move forward are intricately linked. Another essay that demonstrates the same point is Bowers's paper on "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered" ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 6 [1955], 309-324). Although not primarily biographical, this essay analyzes McKerrow's motivations and the scholarly milieu in which his ideas were formed: "Any major work like Prolegomena ," Bowers says, "has behind it a certain climate of thinking, a characteristic point of view which stems from the intellectual position held by its author" (p. 314). Bowers concludes that McKerrow's tendency to restrict the role of editorial judgment (in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare [1939]) was a reaction against what he deemed the excessive liberties taken by nineteenth-century editors and what he saw as abuses of the New Bibliography by J. Dover Wilson. One gains from the essay both an understanding of the origins and evolution of McKerrow's ideas and a point of view regarding proper editorial procedure and its relation to analytical bibliography. The value of the piece as biography grows directly out of the extended thought Bowers had given to editorial matters. A third exemplary piece also deals with a single important work but has a somewhat different focus: Vander Meulen's "The History and Future of Bowers's Principles " ( PBSA , 79 [1985], 197-219) traces the reception of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949) and estimates its role in the future. The essay is the most thorough examination we have of the immediate and later reactions to a major bibliographical work; and Vander Meulen's own considerable experience with, and thoughtful consideration of, bibliographical description enables him not only to analyze tellingly the comments of reviewers and others but also to frame trenchant questions about the future course of descriptive bibliography. He places the Principles in history and suggests, in the process, the validity of the point of view it teaches. If I may refer again to my own work, I should like to comment on one further kind of essay that has not been much practiced. In 1986 I contributed to A Companion to Melville Studies (edited by John Bryant) an essay called "Melville and the World of Books" (pp. 781-835), which I conceived of differently from the usual survey of research. I wanted not only to pay some attention to the history of bibliographical work on Melville but, by including all kinds of research and writing that could be called bibliographical, to show the interrelatedness of all the work. The essay therefore takes up the researches on Melville's book-buying and reading and on the original and subsequent publication and reception of his writings, the efforts to record all the printings of his work and all the commentary on it, and the studies and editions aimed at establishing texts of his works. These various investigations, taken together, deal with Melville's relation to the world of handwritten and printed matter, to the segment of human experience involving the attempt to transmit verbal statements in physical form. Each of these studies contributes, in greater or lesser degree, to an understanding of the cycle that leads from the formation of Melville's ideas under the influence of other writers to the influence of his writings on later individuals who put their thoughts on paper. The never-ending process of returning to documents of the past for the stimulation that produces new insights, to be recorded in their turn in new documents, cannot be effectively studied without the point of view that analytical bibliography affords, for ideas are affected at every step of the way by the physical means of their transmission. As I said in the Melville essay, "It matters what editions, and what copies, of Shakespeare and Rabelais, of Thomas Beale and William Scoresby, Melville read, just as it matters what copies of what editions of his own writings were read by various commentators. The line connecting a copy of a book Melville read to the expropriation or adaptation of its text in one of his own works, and then from a copy of an edition of that work to the interpretation of its text by a critic who read that copy, is a direct one, if only it can be discerned" (pp. 782-783). The line can be extended further, for it obviously matters what copy of what edition of a critic's work is read by a later reader: we need to understand that "all printed texts, those of commentators as well as those of the authors commented on, must be approached with the same alertness to the possibility of variation among copies and the same awareness of how physical processes of production affect texts" (p. 799). One of the advantages of considering together these different kinds of bibliographical work is that it will help readers to question the standard concepts by which material is divided into "primary" and "secondary" and the usual treatment accorded the resulting categories. Surveys of the bibliographical scholarship in particular fields, like surveys of other kinds of scholarship, are a standard scholarly genre, and in a sense they are all examples of the study of bibliographical history. But those that are little more than lists in essay form may be regarded as bearing the same relation to historical writing that checklists bear to descriptive bibliographies. What turns a survey of previous work into a history of scholarship, however, is not so much the extent of the commentary (which is a function of the scale of the piece) but the point of view imbuing the whole. Whether one's subject is the bibliographical work of all kinds on a given topic or the bibliographical work of a single kind on all topics, one will have little insight into the subject without a background of thinking about the transmission of works made of words. Accounts of bibliographical history, like other historical writings, can be only as penetrating as the viewpoints that shape them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The examples of writings on bibliographical history that I have mentioned were chosen to help delineate the contours of the field and to suggest directions for further work. Although the literature of the history of physical bibliography, as a field of scholarly inquiry, is not extensive, there are nevertheless many other writings that could be named. The bulk of them consists of retrospective pieces written by persons who were alive at the time of the events they are discussing—a situation not unexpected in a field that has had its principal development in the twentieth century. But some publications by scholars looking back to periods before their own time do exist. In any case, whatever published material there is serves to show how the field has been thought of and forms a body of literature that future historians will have to know. It may be useful at this stage to give some idea of what that literature consists of. A natural category to begin with is the history of bibliographical societies, best represented, of course, by F. C. Francis's essay ("The Bibliographical Society: A Sketch of the First Fifty Years") in The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942 (pp. 1-22). Two earlier accounts of the Bibliographical Society are also important (particularly the second, by the man who was the Society's guiding spirit for over forty years): Falconer Madan, "The Bibliographical Society," Bibliographica , 2 (1896), 479-488; and A. W. Pollard, "Our Twenty-First Birthday," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 13 (1913-15), 9-27. 25 The Bibliographical Society of America has been treated in two essays, the first by Henry B. Van Hoesen ("The Bibliographical Society of America: Its Leaders and Activities, 1904-1939," PBSA , 35 [1941], 177-202), the second, on the Society's seventy-fifth anniversary, by J. M. Edelstein ("The Bibliographical Society of America, 1904-1979," PBSA , 73 [1979], 389-422); and there is a more specialized piece, on the early years, by Wayne A. Wiegand ("Library Politics and the Organization of the Bibliographical Society of America," Journal of Library History , 21 [1986], 131-157). F. P. Wilson covered "The Malone Society: The First Fifty Years, 1906-1956," in Malone Society Collections , 4 (1956), 1-16; and Edward Born provided an anniversary history of the Gutenberg-Gesellschaft, 1901-1976 (1976). A brief general treatment is Savina A. Roxas's article (headed "Bibliographical Societies, Development of") in the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science (2 [1969], 384-388)—an encyclopedia that includes historical accounts of individual societies, such as Roxas's on the Bibliographical Society (2: 401-405) and J. M. Edelstein's on the Bibliographical Society of America (2: 395-401). A sketch of the growth of bibliographical societies all over the world in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was provided much earlier by G. F. Barwick ("Bibliographical Societies and Bibliography," Library , 4th ser., 11 [1930-31], 151-159), 26 and at the same time Ruth S. Granniss, the long-time librarian of the Grolier Club, wrote on "What Bibliography Owes to Private Book Clubs" ( PBSA , 24 [1930], 14-33). 27 As her essay suggests, any examination of the influence of organizations on the study of books as artifacts must include bibliophilic and typophilic clubs as well as bibliographical societies. The basic works, still not superseded, are, for British clubs, Abraham Hume's The Learned Societies and Printing Clubs of the United Kingdom (1847, 1853) and Harold Williams's Book Clubs &amp; Printing Societies of Great Britain and Ireland (1929); and, for American clubs, Adolf Growoll's American Book Clubs (1897)—supplemented by Florence M. Power's "American Private Book Clubs," Bulletin of Bibliography , 20 (1950-53), 216-220, 233-236—and Lois Rather's Books and Societies (1971). 28 Many individual clubs have published their own histories, such as Clive Bigham's The Roxburghe Club (1928), Nicolas Barker's The Publications of the Roxburghe Club (1964), John T. Winterich's The Grolier Club (1950, 1967), and the collaborative volume The Grolier Club, 1884-1984: Its Library, Exhibitions, &amp; Publications (1984). 29 All these works are useful sources, but there are gaps in the coverage, such as the post-World War II history of the Bibliographical Society and the history of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. And the scholarly history that would consolidate these individual histories into a comprehensive study of the development and achievement of learned societies and social clubs in the field of bibliography remains to be written. A related area is the history of bibliographical journals, which are often produced by bibliographical societies, though there are illustrious exceptions. A. W. Pollard predictably handled the early history of the Bibliographical Society's journal in excellent fashion (" The Library : A History of Forty Volumes," Library , 4th ser., 10 [1929-30], 398-418), and I have discussed its early newsletter ("The Bibliographical Society's News Sheet , 1894-1920," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1967 , pp. 297-307). Pollard's important three-year experiment, Bibliographica , has received some well-deserved attention from Robin Myers (" Bibliographica ," Private Library , 3rd ser., 2 [1979], 86-94). Desmond Flower wrote up the story of his and A. J. A. Symons's Book Collector's Quarterly (" The Book Collector's Quarterly ," Private Library , 2nd ser., 1 [1968], 2-6; 3rd ser., 1 [1978], 39-48), and in that journal he had published an assessment of Oliver Simon and Stanley Morison's splendid Fleuron ("Tradition and Experiment: The Fleuron I—VII." Book Collector's Quarterly , 2 [March 1931], 93-100; see also James Moran, "The Fortieth Anniversary of The Fleuron ," Black Art , 1 [1962], 106-113). The Fleuron and two other journals were given extended treatment by Grant Shipcott in Typographical Periodicals between the Wars: A Critique of "The Fleuron," "Signature" and "Typography" (1980), the published version of a thesis at Oxford Polytechnic; I know of no other book-length study of this kind, examining a group of related bibliographical or typographical journals, and it is to be hoped that the presence of this book will stimulate others to pursue similar topics. Several briefer overviews, however, are available: Ruari McLean, "Some Typographical Journals, 1900-1939," in Liber Amicorum Herman Liebaers (1984), pp. 307-315; Lawrence P. Murphy, "'Published for Book Lovers': A Short History of American Book Collecting Magazines," Book Collector's Market , 4, no. 5 (September-October 1979), 1, 4-10; Claude A. Prance, "Elliot Stock and Some Old Book-Collecting Magazines," Private Library , 3rd ser., 2 (1979), 42-48; and Joseph Blumenthal, "American Book Arts Magazines," Fine Print , 6, no. 1 (January 1980), 4-9. Mention of Elliot Stock causes one to think of books in series, for he is perhaps best remembered as the publisher of "The Book Lover's Library," which in twenty-five volumes (1886-1902) is the most extensive series of books on books yet produced. Prance has also written on this aspect of Stock's career ("The Book Lover's Library," Private Library , 3rd ser., 6 [1983], 132-139); Stock's role as publisher of other bibliographical work in the early days of the Bibliographical Society calls for further examination. (I should call attention here, parenthetically, to the frequency with which the Private Library has been mentioned in the last page or so: the editors deserve praise for the space they have devoted in recent years to the history of bibliophilic publications.) The general subject of such series of books was well surveyed in the mid-1930s by Ruth S. Granniss ("Series of Books about Books," Colophon , n.s., 1 [1935-36], 549-564). Another kind of series—that of lectures—has recently been given some welcome historical attention. The series of Sandars (Cambridge, 1894- ) and Lyell (Oxford, 1952- ) lectures have a significant place in the history of physical bibliography, and David McKitterick has taken the basic first step in studying them by producing The Sandars and Lyell Lectures: A Checklist (1983). In a preface he describes the foundation of the two series, and in the entries he provides references to the manuscripts or typescripts of the lectures when their locations are known (the Sandars have usually been deposited in Cambridge University Library and the British Library) and cites any published forms of them (including summaries in contemporary periodicals). The way is now prepared for someone to undertake a narrative history, and the Sandars series particularly demands this treatment: it was intimately bound up with the early history of the New Bibliography, having been established two years after the founding of the Bibliographical Society and in the same year when Greg and McKerrow entered Trinity College, Cambridge. (The remarkable roll of Cambridge bibliographers and editors—from Bennet and Bentley to Bradshaw, Housman, McKerrow, and Greg, and on to Carter and Munby—gives it a special place in the history of bibliography.) The largest category of the literature of bibliographical history consists of biographical writings. Although there are few book-length biographies, and not many pieces of any length that are critical assessments by scholars who did not know their subjects personally, this literature is nevertheless a rich one because of the high quality of the memorial tributes to the major figures. There is no better way to gain a sense of how the field developed than to read these memoirs; even after a thorough scholarly history appears, they will remain of value for their immediacy in displaying the qualities of mind that shaped the field. Of the five major figures before 1950—Bradshaw, Proctor, Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg—only Bradshaw (1831-86) has thus far been the subject of much scholarship, and he awaits a modern biography that would give appropriate attention to his bibliographical achievements. Two years after Bradshaw's death George W. Prothero published A Memoir of Henry Bradshaw (1888), a long Victorian life-and-letters that emphasized Bradshaw's librarianship of Cambridge University Library. A volume of Collected Papers (edited by Francis Jenkinson) appeared the following year, and in 1904 A. W. Pollard edited "Letters of Henry Bradshaw to Officials of the British Museum" ( Library , n.s., 5: 266-292, 431-442). The next serious work on Bradshaw did not occur until some sixty years later: Wytze and Lotte Hellinga's extensively annotated two-volume edition of Henry Bradshaw's Correspondence on Incunabula with J. W. Holtrop and M. F. A. G. Campbell (1966-78). Because Bradshaw's influence on other scholars resulted more from his correspondence with them than from the publication of essays, his letters are particularly important, and several further selections of them have seen print (e.g., those edited by David McKitterick in Hellinga Festschrift [1980], pp. 335-338, and in Quaerendo , 11 [1981], 128-164). At this time Robin Myers also contributed a basic account of Bradshaw's work on Caxton ("William Blades's Debt to Henry Bradshaw and G. I. F. Tupper in His Caxton Studies: A Further Look at Unpublished Documents," Library , 5th ser., 5 [1978], 265-283). In 1984 Roy Stokes performed a valuable service by editing a volume ( Henry Bradshaw, 1831-1886 ) containing a selection of Bradshaw's work, along with an introductory essay and lists of Bradshaw's publications and of writings about him. 30 (This volume is the sixth in a series called "The Great Bibliographers," published by the Scarecrow Press, the first five being on McKerrow, Pollard, Dibdin, McMurtrie, and Sadleir.) Bradhaw had thus been far less neglected than most bibliographers by the time of the centennial of his death, which was marked by several events: an exhibition at Cambridge University Library; the publication of McKitterick's history of the Library, containing new information about Bradshaw; and Needham's delivery of his Hanes Lecture, the most penetrating discussion of Bradshaw yet written, and a model for historians of bibliography. Robert Proctor (1868-1903), the next great figure in the history of the analysis of bibliographical evidence and a follower of Bradshaw's, was the subject of a memorable obituary essay by A. W. Pollard ( Library , n.s., 5 [1904], 1-34; reprinted in his 1905 edition of a collection of Proctor's Bibliographical Essays ); Pollard also put together a record of "Robert Proctor's Work" (in the same volume of the Library , pp. 192-205, 223-224). In 1951 Victor Scholderer commented on excerpts from Proctor's diary ("The Private Diary of Robert Proctor," Library , 5th ser., 5: 261-269; reprinted in Scholderer's Fifty Essays [1966], pp. 31-37); and recently Barry C. Johnson published a pamphlet, Lost in the Alps: A Portrait of Robert Proctor (1985), which records some new information but seems more interested in the mystery of Proctor's death than in the details of his bibliographical scholarship. Pollard (1859-1944), whose important work first on incunabula and then on Shakespeare made him a transition figure between the nineteenth-century analytical bibliography and that of the twentieth century and whose leadership caused the New Bibliography at first to be thought of as the "school of Pollard," did see into print some fragments of autobiography: "Reminiscences of an Amateur Book-Builder" ( Colophon , part 4 [December 1930]) and "My First Fifty Years" (in A Select Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred W. Pollard [1938], pp. 1-15, and completed by Henry Thomas's "From Fifty to Seventy-Five," pp. 16-20), in addition to Two Brothers: Accounts Rendered (1916, 1917), on his two sons who were killed in the war. Following his death John Dover Wilson wrote a thorough and moving memoir ( Proceedings of the British Academy , 31 [1945], 256-306) and, a quarter-century later, devoted a section of his autobiography, Milestones on the Dover Road (1969), to Pollard ("The Scholar as Saint: Alfred Pollard," pp. 237-249). F. C. Francis contributed an obituary to the Library (4th ser., 25 [1944-45], 82-86), and the Bibliographical Society's annual report in the same issue called Pollard "the creator of the Society as we know it to-day" (p. 101). The 1938 checklist of Pollard's voluminous writings is supplemented in the volume in the "Great Bibliographers" series, Alfred William Pollard: A Selection of His Essays (edited by Fred W. Roper, 1976), which also reprints Wilson's earlier memoir and includes an essay by Roger Leachman (based on his Master's thesis at the University of North Carolina) entitled "Alfred William Pollard: His Influence on Contemporary Bibliography" (pp. 58-77). R. B. McKerrow (1872-1940), who published several of the monuments of the New Bibliography (the edition of Nashe, the Introduction to Bibliography , the registers of publishers' devices and title-page borders, the Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare ), was given a fine memorial tribute by W. W. Greg ( Proceedings of the British Academy , 26 [1940], 488-515) and a checklist by F. C. Francis ( Library , 4th ser., 21 [1940-41], 229-263). Besides the essay by Fredson Bowers mentioned earlier, the only other major publication about McKerrow is the volume in the "Great Bibliographers" series, Ronald Brunlees McKerrow: A Selection of His Essays (edited by John Philip Immroth, 1974), which includes Greg's memoir and a revision of Francis's checklist. Robin Myers has also written an account of the Introduction to Bibliography in her "Key Works in Bibliography" series ( Antiquarian Book Monthly Review , 5 [1978], 8-9, 11). W.W. Greg (1875-1959) produced an even larger body of important work than the others, and with good reason F. P. Wilson called him the "hero" of his account of the New Bibliography. Greg's Biographical Notes, 1877-1947 , written in 1948, were privately printed at the Bodleian in 1960; a checklist of his writings was prepared by F. C. Francis in 1945 ( Library , 4th ser., 26 [1945-46], 72-97, where Francis says that his work was marked "by a singleness of purpose rarely aspired to and practically never attained") and was supplemented by D. F. McKenzie fifteen years later ( Library , 5th ser., 15 [1960], 42-46). F. P. Wilson wrote a substantial memoir of Greg ( Proceedings of the British Academy , 45 [1959], 307-334), and a collection of tributes (by J. C. T. Oates, J. Dover Wilson, Alice Walker, Muriel St. Clare Byrne, Fredson Bowers, and F. C. Francis) was gathered in the Library (5th ser., 14 [1959], 151-174). Greg's A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939-59) has been discussed by Robin Myers as one of the "Key Works in Bibliography" ( Antiquarian Book Monthly Review , 5 [1978], 98-100, 102). In 1966 J. C. Maxwell edited Greg's Collected Papers , incorporating some revisions from Greg's notes. Although there is not much directly biographical writing about Greg, his ideas have been the subject of extensive discussion. Because he made a number of important general statements about the field, as well as basic contributions to the development of thinking about descriptive bibliography and scholarly editing, there is an enormous literature that comments on his work. A large part of what has been written on textual criticism in English since 1950, for example, analyzes his essay "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Most of this writing is not specifically historical in aim; it is the kind of discussion that grows up around any figure whose work is influential—as it has done, indeed, around the other great bibliographers (though Greg seems to be the subject of more of it). But some of the commentary does try, however briefly, to account for the origins or timing of Greg's ideas, 31 and it is of course part of the material that the biographer of Greg must deal with. One may read in some detail about the lives of a few of the other figures active in the Bibliographical Society in its early years, such as J. Y. W. MacAlister (1856-1925), a founder of the Society ( Sir John Young Walker MacAlister: A Memorial for His Family and Friends , 1926—which includes Pollard's memoir originally printed in the Library , 4th ser., 6 [1926], 375-380), Talbot Baines Reed (1852-93), the first Secretary of the Society (Stanley Morison's Talbot Baines Reed , 1960), and Francis Jenkinson (1853-1923), President of the Society from 1900 to 1902 (H. F. Stewart's Francis Jenkinson , 1926). T. J. Wise (1859-1937), President of the Society from 1922 to 1924, has become—as a result of his bibliographical crimes rather than his bibliographical scholarship—the focus of a whole historical industry. The fullest account of the forgeries, as well as the best guide to the writings on the subject, is Nicolas Barker and John Collins's A Sequel to "An Enquiry" . . . The Forgeries of H. Buxton Forman &amp; T. J. Wise Re-examined (1983); John Carter and Graham Pollard also described the "Aftermath of 'An Enquiry'" in an essay published as the epilogue to the 1983 printing of An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets . David Foxon takes up another of Wise's crimes, the removal of leaves from books in the British Museum library, in Thomas J. Wise and the Pre-Restoration Drama (1959). In the midst of all this, there is one essay on Wise's place in the growth of author bibliography (Simon Nowell-Smith, "T. J. Wise as Bibliographer," Library , 5th ser., 24 [1969], 129-141). A contemporary of Wise's, M. R. James (1862-1936), who was active in the Bibliographical Society somewhat later and was one of the inaugural recipients of its Gold Medal in 1929, has inspired a considerable literature (partly because of the interest in his ghost stories), from S. G. Lubbock's A Memoir of Montague Rhodes James (1939; with a checklist by A. F. Scholfield) to the recent books by Richard William Pfaff ( Montague Rhodes James [1980], with a new checklist of his scholarly writings) and Michael Cox ( M. R. James: An Informal Portrait [1983], with a list of writings about James). His reminiscences, Eton and King's (1926), help to paint the picture of Cambridge at an important time for bibliography. (Another contemporary, A. E. Housman [1859-1936], was not a member of the Bibliographical Society, but his textual work should be taken into account along with that of the early members of the Society, and a great deal has of course been written about him.) 32 A figure of the next generation who should be mentioned with this group is J. B. Oldham (1882-1962), whose work on bindings earned him the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society; he is now the subject of a book ( J. B. Oldham, 1882-1962 , 1986) by M. L. Charlesworth, who does not, however, say much about his bibliographical work. A still later member of the Bibliographical Society but a contributor (the only American contributor) to its anniversary volume, W. A. Jackson (1905-64), has been well served by William H. Bond, who in Records of a Bibliographer (1967) presented an admirable biographical sketch and a checklist, as well as a selection of Jackson's essays. A few individuals earlier than Bradshaw can be seen, in one respect or another, as forerunners of modern physical bibliography. Thomas Bennet (1673-1728), whose An Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles of Religion (1715) employs printing evidence derived from collation in considering the authenticity of the opening of the twentieth article, has been discussed both by Strickland Gibson ("Thomas Bennet, a Forgotten Bibliographer," Library , 5th ser., 6 [1951], 43-47) and, in an excellent piece of bibliographical history, by William L. Williamson ("Thomas Bennet and the Origins of Analytical Bibliography," Journal of Library History , 16 [1981], 177-186). The Prolusions (1760) and other writings of Edward Capell (1713-81) have been examined by David Foxon for their role in the development of quasi-facsimile transcription ( Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description , 1970). 33 Thomas Frognall Dibdin (1776-1847) and Thomas Hartwell Horne (1780-1862) may be less easy to relate to modern methods, but their activities and reminiscences (e.g., Dibdin's Reminiscences of a Literary Life , 1836; Horne's Reminiscences Personal and Bibliographical , 1862) are part of what the historian of physical bibliography has to take into account for the early nineteenth century (see also William A. Jackson's An Annotated List of the Publications of the Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin , 1965; and the 1978 volume, Thomas Frognall Dibdin: Selections , edited by Victor E. Neuburg for the "Great Bibliographers" series). An important contemporary of Bradshaw—indeed, one of Bradshaw's principal correspondents—was the printer William Blades (1824-90), championed as "the founder of modern scientific bibliography" by Stanley Morison (who was thinking of the study of typography, not the New Bibliography) in his introduction to Type Specimen Facsimiles (edited by John Dreyfus, 1963 [p. xix]; reprinted with another essay as Letter Forms , 1968). Talbot Baines Reed wrote a memoir of Blades (with a checklist) for the posthumous publication of The Pentateuch of Printing (1891). Blades's work on Caxton and his connections with Bradshaw have been repeatedly discussed, as in James Moran's "William Blades" ( Library , 5th ser., 16 [1961], 251-266), Robin Myers's 1978 article (mentioned above) and her "The Caxton Celebration of 1877: A Landmark in Bibliophily" (in Bibliophily , edited by Myers and Michael Harris, 1986; pp. 138-163), and Lotte Hellinga's Caxton in Focus (1982; see "William Blades," pp. 36-40). Blades's (and Bradshaw's) relations with Tupper are explored in Robin Myers, "George Isaac Frederick Tupper, Facsimilist, 'whose ability in this description of work is beyond praise' (1820?-1911)," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 7, part 2 (1978), 113-134. The next generation after Greg's produced a remarkable group of bibliographers from the ranks of publishers and booksellers. The mentor of many of them was the publisher Michael Sadleir (1888-1957), whose Trollope bibliography appeared as early as 1928; he wrote some "Passages from the Autobiography of a Bibliomaniac" for the great catalogue of his collection, XIX Century Fiction (1951) and was the subject of an amusing piece by Simon Nowell-Smith ("Sadleir Sadleirized," New Colophon , 2 [1949], 135-142). At his death both John Carter ( Book Collector , 7 [1958], 58-61) and Graham Pollard ( Library , 5th ser., 13 [1958], 129-131) wrote tributes, and Simon Nowell-Smith prepared a checklist ( Library , pp. 132-138). Robin Myers made XIX Century Fiction the first work discussed in her "Key Works in Bibliography" series ( Antiquarian Book Monthly Review , 4 [1977], 394-398), and Roy Stokes edited (with introductory essay and revised checklist) a volume on Sadleir for the "Great Bibliographers" series ( Michael Sadleir, 1888-1957 , 1980). No doubt the most celebrated members of this group were John Carter (1905-75) and Graham Pollard (1903-76)—both from the antiquarian book trade—because of their exposure in 1934 of Wise's fabrications through a pioneer use of physical analysis applied to nineteenth-century materials. This aspect of their lives is of course well covered by Barker and Collins in A Sequel to "An Enquiry ." Carter wrote some reminiscences of other parts of his life, such as "Sotheby's of London, New York: The Early Days; Some Egotistical Reminiscences" ( Art at Auction 1970-71 , pp. 34-47), and he supplied a biography of Pollard for Studies in the Book Trade in Honour of Graham Pollard , edited by R. W. Hunt, I. G. Philip, and R. J. Roberts (1975), a volume that also includes a checklist of Pollard's published work. Nicolas Barker wrote substantial memoirs of both Carter and Pollard ( Book Collector , 24 [1975], 202-216 passim ; 26 [1977], 7-28 passim ), and P. H. Muir also recorded some recollections of Carter for the Book Collector (24: 271-276 passim ). Muir (1894-1979), another bookseller-bibliographer closely associated with this group, published an informative autobiography, Minding My Own Business (1956) and was honored on his eightieth birthday with a booklet edited by Laurie Deval ( P.H.M. 80 , 1974); in 1980 Barker wrote an obituary tribute for the Book Collector (29: 85-88), and three years later Muir's widow was responsible for the appearance of P. H. Muir: A Check List of His Published Work (a supplement was added in 1985, and in 1986, under the name Barbara Kaye, she published The Company We Kept , her sequel to his autobiography). John Hayward (1904-65), dominant force behind the Book Collector for seventeen years, was the subject of a particularly evocative group of tributes edited by John Carter ("John Hayward, 1904-1965: Some Memories," Book Collector , 14 [1965], 443-486; also published as a pamphlet). And A. N. L. Munby (1913-74), librarian of King's College, Cambridge, for twenty-seven years and himself a bibliographical historian of distinction in his five-volume work on the collection of Thomas Phillipps ( Phillipps Studies , 1951-60), has been taken up in several memoirs besides those by Barker in the Book Collector (24 [1975], 191-201 passim ) and (with checklist appended) in Munby's Essays and Papers (1978): Patrick Wilkinson, Alan Noel Latimer Munby (1975); Harold Forster, "'Munby Ltd,'" Book Collector , 31 (1982), 331-338; John R. Gretton, "A. N. L. Munby: A Tribute," in Essays in Book-Collecting (1985), pp. 76-80. As these names and citations show, book collecting and antiquarian bookselling intersect bibliography so extensively that most biographies of individuals associated with any of these areas are relevant to a study of the others. For a picture of the bibliographical world of the first half of the twentieth century, one should not neglect, for example, such biographical accounts of dealers as Rosenbach (1960), a detailed biography of the great Philadelphia dealer by Edwin Wolf 2nd with John Fleming, and Dukedom Large Enough (1969), the reminiscences of David A. Randall, who was in charge of rare books at Scribner's in New York while John Carter was Scribner's rare-book representative in London. Similarly, the famous physician-collectors William Osler (1849-1919) and Geoffrey Keynes (1887-1982) have a place in bibliographical history, the former for Bibliotheca Osleriana and Incunabula Medica and the latter for his long series of bibliographies of writers he collected (both were presidents of the Bibliographical Society). For both, we have their own statements about their collecting ("The Collecting of a Library" in Bibliotheca Osleriana [1929]; "Religio Bibliographici" in Keynes's Bibliotheca Bibliographici [1964], earlier published in the Library , 5th ser., 8 [1953], 63-76) and full-length biographical accounts (Harvey Cushing's massive The Life of Sir William Osler [1926] and Keynes's autobiography, The Gates of Memory [1981]), along with some later assessments (particularly Charles G. Roland's of Osler and Nicolas Barker's of Keynes). 34 Dealers and collectors seem to have engaged in more autobiographical writing than have bibliographers, some of it not perhaps immediately related to the concerns of analytical bibliographers but all of it contributing to a picture of that part of the book world in which analytical bibliography exists. 35 And this picture has been extended by a number of scholarly studies of dealers and collectors, some notable examples (besides Rosenbach and Phillipps Studies ) being Wilmarth Lewis's Horace Walpole's Library (1958), Wyman W. Parker's Henry Stevens of Vermont (1963), B. L. Reid's The Man from New York [John Quinn] (1968), Cyril E. Wright's Fontes Harleiani (1971; following his and Ruth C. Wright's edition of The Diary of Humphrey Wanley , 1966), Anthony Hobson's Apollo and Pegasus [Grimaldi] (1975), and Nicolas Barker's Bibliotheca Lindesiana (1977), along with such catalogues as Allen T. Hazen's A Catalogue of Horace Walpole's Library (1969), Gabriel Austin's The Library of Jean Grolier (1971), and Edwin Wolf's The Library of James Logan of Philadelphia (1974). Scholars of typographic history are another class of students of the physical book: the most thoroughly discussed is Stanley Morison (1889-1967), the subject of a biography by Nicolas Barker (1972) and of many shorter memoirs; 36 but volumes of collected essays and Festschriften, usually containing checklists and introductory appreciations, provide a starting point for biographical work on a number of others. 37 In the second half of the twentieth century the dominant bibliographical scholar is Fredson Bowers. He, like Greg, has been the focus of a great deal of commentary; but the most clearly historical pieces that have thus far appeared about him are probably two essays included in "Fredson Bowers at Eighty" ( PBSA , 79 [1985], 173-226; also printed as a separate)—David Vander Meulen's (mentioned above) on the Principles and mine on "The Achievement of Fredson Bowers." A pictorial booklet, A Keepsake to Honor Fredson Bowers , marked the occasion of his retirement in 1974; a checklist of his writings is included in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 531-548, and is supplemented in PBSA , 79 (1985), 221-226. His own tribute to Charlton Hinman ( Book Collector , 26 [1977], 389-391) is worth examining for his comments on the other primary developer of analytical bibliography in this period. Robin Myers has discussed both Bowers's Principles and Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) in her "Key Works" series ( Antiquarian Book Monthly Review , 6 [1979], 362-367 passim ; 8 [1981], 219-223). 38 All these biographical accounts, and the studies of bibliographical societies and journals, provide glimpses—sometimes scholarly, sometimes journalistic and anecdotal—into particular segments of bibliographical history. Such writings form part of the basis, along with the bibliographical work itself, on which more comprehensive histories can be constructed. But very few efforts of broader scope have been attempted. Greg's "Notes on Dramatic Bibliographers" ( Malone Society Collections , 1, parts 4-5 [1911], 324-340; 2, part 3 [1931], 235-238) limits itself to lists (from 1656 to 1812) of English plays—making the point that "a familiarity with the history of dramatic bibliography is often necessary for the criticism of current and received opinions" (p. 324). A true precursor of F. P. Wilson's essay is Percy Simpson's "The Bibliographical Study of Shakespeare" ( Oxford Bibliographical Society Publications , 1, part 1 [1923], 19-53), an excellent piece of work that "attempts to show historically how recent scholarship has worked with effect on the problems of the text of Shakespeare" (p. 49) and sees Pollard as the leading figure. 39 There has been nothing, however, like Wilson's piece since. George Watson Cole, in 1929, published "A Survey of the Bibliography of English Literature, 1475-1640, with Especial Reference to the Work of the Bibliographical Society of London" ( PBSA , 23, part 2: 1-95), which—though it is not a continuous narrative—is a useful (and neglected) work: it consists of a chronological sequence of historical sketches (some several pages in length) of individuals and institutions that have produced important bibliographies, with appended sections listing the bibliographies and reproducing sample entries from them. 40 Some sense of historical development is often conveyed in the introductory comments to scholarly books and articles, but they rarely become full-fledged historical studies. One exception is Morison's long essay "On the Classification of Typographical Variations," prefixed to Type Specimen Facsimiles (mentioned above for its discussion of Blades), a large part of which (pp. xvii-xxviii) deals with the history of typographical scholarship. Foxon's Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (cited earlier for its recognition of Capell) is another rare instance of historical attention to an aspect of physical bibliography, in this case the conventions of title-page transcription. My two essays on twentieth-century bibliographical history are much broader in scope than Wilson or Morison or Foxon but are much less detailed. Obviously this survey of the literature of bibliographical history must be anticlimactic: there are many reminiscences and some detailed studies but very little that tries to pull the disparate parts of the story together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The works that I have alluded to here are only a sampling of what exists—but, I hope, a sampling that suggests the range of the published material and one that includes most of the basic items. Many more books and essays that are retrospective in one way or another could be mentioned, particularly those that are anniversary or obituary tributes to particular individuals. There is a large roster of people, active during the Bibliographical Society's first half-century, who deserve attention, in addition to those already mentioned as subjects of historical writing—among them, G. F. Barwick, R. W. Chapman, W. A. Copinger, Cyril Davenport, E. Gordon Duff, F. S. Ferguson, F. C. Francis, Stephen Gaselee, Strickland Gibson, E. P. Goldschmidt, Konrad Haebler, G. D. Hobson, Falconer Madan, Henry R. Plomer, Charles Sayle, Percy Simpson, Henry Thomas, Edward Maunde Thompson, W. H. J. Weale, H. B. Wheatley, Harold Williams, Iolo A. Williams, F. P. Wilson, and J. Dover Wilson. One can locate obituaries, DNB articles, and the like for these figures and others, just as one can find—through indexes, guides, and patient searches—further bibliographical writings with some historical perspective. Voluminous as this literature is, it is largely the natural by-product of the development of the field, not the result of disinterested scholarly investigation. Of the works that I have named, the majority are personal reminiscences. The field may not be old, but it is old enough that independent judgments concerning the accomplishments of its earlier years are possible. The writings mentioned here, and others like them, should be familiar to all bibliographers, for they show what traditions have grown up in the field and how previous bibliographers have looked at their colleagues and predecessors. But the historian of bibliography, in addition to knowing this retrospective work, must of course return to the bibliographical scholarship itself and to any unpublished material relating to it. The scholarship is not as conveniently indexed as one might wish, and some of it remains hidden in monographs and essays indexed only under the authors of the books analyzed, not under the bibliographical approaches employed. But much of the material is in fact accessible through a series of indexes and guides, 41 though their presence should never cause one to neglect the systematic searching of shelves and of periodicals, a process by which one's sense of the growth of a field will more fully emerge. The whereabouts of the relevant collections of unpublished letters and papers are, as in all fields, less easy to determine. Scholars' papers, when they are preserved at all, are likely to be in the institutions with which they were associated, for such papers are regarded more often as part of institutional archives than as manuscripts of independent interest. As long as the papers are properly cared for, one should perhaps not complain; many scholars do, after all, play prominent roles in their institutions and deserve a place in the collections that support institutional memory. But many scholars (and not always different ones) have taken important parts on the broader stage of international scholarship; and the fact that their papers are often regarded as being primarily of local interest suggests the position that the history of scholarship occupies in the hierarchy adopted by many collectors of manuscripts in institutional libraries. Writing history—the attempt to reconstruct some segment of the past —is always a creative activity. The shapes that historians give to the past are the products of particular points of view and particular selections of details. As we move forward, our sense of how we got to our present location changes, and new versions of the past continually emerge. When the subject of our history is humanistic scholarship, we are looking at individuals who were historians themselves, individuals who chose the study of the past as their way of coming to terms with the world. Historians of science and of belles lettres, painting, music, and the other arts deal with the same kind of individuals, who happen to have taken different routes to satisfy the same creative urge, the urge to place the stamp of human control on what seems to be the chaos outside the mind. Some novelists and scientists may decide that chaos is the ultimate reality, but even then they have imposed a human conception on the exterior world and can thereby feel that in some way they have mastered it. F. C. Francis's reference to the "sense of common adventure" that characterized the Bibliographical Society in its early years can be applied more generally: for all who think about their relation to their surroundings, and endeavor to explain the past or present or future, share a common adventure. Biographies give us the story of that adventure, life by life, showing how creative pursuits relate to the exigencies of living. And the story of a field is a shaped collection of such biographies. The number of lives that have been devoted to bibliography is not large, because the significance of the field, and thus of bibliographical lives, is often underestimated. But the concerns of the field are of fundamental importance to all literate beings: everyone who reads is affected by bibliographical discoveries and concepts, for every text is likely to be altered in the process of its transmission; and a knowledge of how the physical objects that bear verbal messages were produced will influence how one approaches any text. 42 When we write bibliographical history we are adding to the record of human creativity and in the process showing what bibliography contributes to the life of the mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This work is surveyed in Hugh Lloyd-Jones's introduction to Alan Harris's translation of Wilamowitz ( History of Classical Scholarship , 1982). The history of classical scholarship and the history of bibliography are in fact linked, a major connection being the history of textual criticism. Two basic works on the textual criticism of the classics are L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson's Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature (1968, 1974) and E. J. Kenney's The Classical Text: Aspects of Editing in the Age of the Printed Book (1974). See also some of the essays of M. D. Feld, such as "The Early Evolution of the Authoritative Text," Harvard Library Bulletin , 26 (1978), 81-111, and "A Theory of the Early Italian Printing Firm," ibid. , 33 (1985), 341-377. There are a number of biographies of prominent editors of the classics: an impressive recent example is Anthony Grafton's Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship. I: Textual Criticism and Exegesis (1983). See also C. O. Brink, English Classical Scholarship: Historical Reflections on Bentley, Porson and Housman (1986). 2 Although we do have such works as Howard Mumford Jones's The Theory of American Literature (1948, 1965) and Jay B. Hubbell's Who Are the Major American Writers? (1972). 3 The Center is housed in the Manuscript Department of Perkins Library and publishes a newsletter reporting current acquisitions. 4 See Lloyd Hibberd, "Physical and Reference Bibliography," Library , 5th ser., 20 (1965), 124-134. 5 An earlier standard work is Ernest D. Grand, "Bibliographie," in La grande encyclopédie , 6 (1888), 598-682. Besterman's reflections appear in his lecture Fifty Years a Bookman (1974).

Krummel is at present undertaking further work on the history of enumerative bibliography. His forthcoming essay for Library Quarterly , "The Dialectics of Enumerative Bibliography: Observations on the Historical Study of the Practices of Citation," concludes, "The history of bibliography is close to the very essence of the history of learning." 7 The preface to the first volume of the revised STC (1986) concisely recounts the origins and development of the undertaking, describing A. W. Pollard as "the pre-eminent force in bibliographical studies in the first half of this century" (p. vii). 8 Jackson, "The Revised STC : A Progress Report," Book Collector , 4 (1955), 16-27; Pantzer, "The Serpentine Progress of the STC Revision," PBSA , 62 (1968), 297-311; Wing, "The Making of the Short Title Catalogue 1641-1700," PBSA , 45 (1951), 59-69; Alston, "Progress toward an Eighteenth Century STC," Direction Line , 4 (Autumn 1977), 1-15. The ESTC, in particular, has generated a considerable primary literature that will provide material for the future historian: there is the project's newsletter, Factotum (1978- ), its Occasional Papers, and such books as R. C. Alston and M. J. Jannetta's Bibliography, Machine-Readable Cataloguing and the ESTC (1978). Other related projects, like the Nineteenth Century Short Title Catalogue, now have newsletters as well (on this project, see also G. Averley and F. J. G. Robinson, "The Nineteenth Century Short Title Catalogue," Library Association Rare Books Group Newsletter , 22 [November 1983], 15-20). 9 McCrimmon, Power, Politics and Print: The Publication of the British Museum Catalogue, 1881-1900 (1981); Chaplin, "The General Catalogue of Printed Books, 1881-1981," British Library Journal , 7 (1981), 109-119; Smith, "The National Union Catalog: Pre-1956 Imprints," Book Collector , 31 (1982), 445-462 (see also In Celebration: The National Union Catalog, Pre-1956 Imprints , ed.

On the British Museum, see further F. J. Hill, "'Fortescue': The British Museum and British Library Subject Index," British Library Journal , 12 (1986), 58-63. 10 The history of the changing scope of Sabin's Dictionary (which, though a subject bibliography, is also concerned with recording editions and contains a considerable amount of bibliographical analysis) reflects the complex of factors that influence the final form a bibliography takes. See R. W. G. Vail, "Sabin's Dictionary," PBSA , 31 (1937), 1-9; and cf. the article by Thomas R. Adams cited in note 38 below. 11 These works are all cited below. See also Clarence S. Brigham, Fifty Years of Collecting Americana for the Library of the American Antiquarian Society, 1908-1958 (1959); W. A. Munford, Edward Edwards (1963); William L.

Metcalf, Random Recollections of an Anachronism (1980); and Philip J. Weimerskirch, Antonio Panizzi and the British Museum Library (1982). The Scarecrow Press has established a series called "Autobiographies and Biographies of Noted Librarians." A list of "Biographies of Librarians and Library Benefactors" is included in Harris and Davis's American Library History (see note 15 below), pp. 184-218. 12 A historical study of a library reference work is Stuart J. Glogoff, "Cannons' Bibliography of Library Economy and Its Role in the Development of Bibliographic Tools in Librarianship," Journal of Library History , 12 (1977), 57-63. 13 Such as Ernest A. Savage's The Story of Libraries and Book-Collecting (1909) and Old English Libraries (1911), James Westfall Thompson's The Medieval Library (1939) and Ancient Libraries (1940), Raymond Irwin's The English Library (1966), and A. R. A. Hobson's Great Libraries (1970). There are also some good surveys of lesser scope, such as A. N. L. Munby's Cambridge College Libraries (1960, 1962) and Paul Morgan's Oxford Libraries Outside the Bodleian (1973, 1980), or Berthold Ullman and Philip A. Stadter's The Public Library of Renaissance Florence (1972). 14 Such as William D. Johnston's of the Library of Congress (1904), Arundell Esdaile's of the British Museum library (1946), Edmund Craster's of the Bodleian from 1845 to 1945 (1952), Walter Muir Whitehill's of the Boston Public Library (1956), Phyllis Dain's of the New York Public Library (1972), Edward Miller's of the British Museum (1973), Philip Gaskell's of Trinity College (Cambridge) Library (1980), Ian Philip's of the Bodleian in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (1983), and J. C. T. Oates's and David McKitterick's of Cambridge University Library (1986). Some libraries have published substantial accounts in their own journals: e.g., "The Founding of the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery," Huntington Library Quarterly , 32 (1969), 291-373 (and as a separate); William Bentinck-Smith, Building a Great Library: The Coolidge Years at Harvard (1976), originally published in the Harvard Library Bulletin ; and William S. Dix, "The Princeton University Library in the Eighteenth Century," Princeton University Library Chronicle , 40 (1978-79), 1-102. Interim substitutes for full-scale histories have been provided by various anniversary volumes and exhibition catalogues, such as The Houghton Library, 1942-1967 (1967), Major Acquisitions of The Pierpont Morgan Library, 1924-1974 (1974), and The Lilly Library: The First Quarter Century, 1960-1985 (1985), and by chronologies, such as John Y. Cole's For Congress and the Nation (1979). (A broader history in the form of a chronology is Elizabeth W. Stone, American Library Development, 1600-1899 [1977].) 15 Examples for American library history are Michael H. Harris, A Guide to Research in American Library History (1968); Harris and Donald G. Davis, Jr., American Library History: A Bibliography (1978); and the series of state checklists sponsored by the Journal of Library History . 16 Some historical surveys of the scholarship devoted to these areas have been produced. See note 41 below. 17 Listings of currently available books are one kind of reference tool that arises as a by-product of the relationship between publishers, dealers, and buyers; records of copy-rights constitute a similar tool that emerges from legal requirements affecting the activities of publishing and bookselling. Several book-length studies have treated such works historically: Adolf Growoll, Book Trade Bibliography in the United States in the Nineteenth Century (1898) and Three Centuries of English Book Trade Bibliography (1903); R. C. B. Partridge, A History of the Legal Deposit of Books throughout the British Empire (1938); Le Roy H. Linder, The Rise of Current Complete National Bibliography (1959); and Joseph W. Rogers, U. S. National Bibliography and the Copyright Law (1960). See also G. T. Tanselle, "Copyright Records and the Bibliographer," Studies in Bibliography , 22 (1969), 77-124; reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography (1979), pp. 93-138. The history of a related reference tool, auction records, has been discussed by V. H. Paltsits in "The Beginning of American Book Auction Records during the First Quarter Century," American Book Prices Current 1943-44 , pp. xi-xiv. For historical surveys of the work on publishing, see G. T. Tanselle, "The Historiography of American Literary Publishing," SB , 18 (1965), 3-39; and Joe W. Kraus, "The History of Publishing as a Field of Research for Librarians and Others," Advances in Library Administration and Organization , 5 (1986), 33-65. See also note 41 below. 18 Such as John Lawler's Book Auctions in England in the Seventeenth Century (1898), Bernard Quaritch's Contributions towards a Dictionary of English Book-Collectors (1892-1921), Charles and Mary Elton's The Great Book-Collectors (1893), William Y. Fletcher's English Book Collectors (1902), Carl L. Cannon's American Book Collectors and Collecting (1941), and Donald C. Dickinson's Dictionary of American Book Collectors (1986). 19 Other important works of bibliophilic history that reflect a thorough understanding of bibliographical evidence are Seymour De Ricci, English Collectors of Books and Manuscripts (1930); Ruth S. Granniss, "American Book Collecting and the Growth of Libraries," in Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt et al., The Book in America (1939), pp. 293-381; and Edwin Wolf 2nd, "Great American Book Collectors to 1800," Gazette of the Grolier Club , n.s., 16 (June 1971), 3-70. (De Ricci's method of working is described by E. P. Goldschmidt in the Library , 4th ser., 24 [1943-44], 187-194.) John L. Thornton's books ( Medical Books, Libraries and Collectors , 1949, 1966; Thornton and R. I. J. Tully, Scientific Books, Libraries and Collectors , 1954, 1962) deal with the history of both collecting and bibliography. 20 "The Literature of Book Collecting," in Book Collecting: A Modern Guide , ed. Jean Peters (1977), pp. 209-271. 21 This volume has also been discussed by Robin Myers in Antiquarian Book Monthly Review , 6 (1979), 148-153—as part of a series on "Key Works in Bibliography" (other installments deal with Bowers, Greg, Hinman, McKerrow, Sadleir, and Simpson; most are cited individually below). 22 "Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century," in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine: Essays on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Osler Library , ed. Philip M. Teigen (1982), pp. 55-79; and "The Evolving Role of Bibliography, 1884-1984," in Books and Prints, Past and Future: Papers Presented at the Grolier Club Centennial Convocation (1984), pp. 15-31. 23 I have also made these points in two other essays that deal more narrowly with the history of descriptive bibliography: "The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors," SB , 21 (1968), 1-24; "The Descriptive Bibliography of Eighteenth-Century Books," in Eighteenth-Century English Books Considered by Librarians and Booksellers, Bibliographers and Collectors (1976), pp. 22-33. 24 Both in the body of the lecture and in an appendix, "Henry Bradshaw and the Development of the Collational Formula," which is the most detailed historical account of the formula yet written. 25 In connection with studying the origins of the Bibliographical Society, one should take a look at W. H. K. Wright's "The Library Association, 1877-1897: A Retrospect," Library , 1st ser., 10 (1898), 197-207, 245-254. 26 Barwick says that the Bibliographical Society in London "has done more to encourage and develop scientific bibliography than any other in the world," and he makes the charitable observation on the Bibliographical Society of America that "Its work is scientific when necessary, but its scope is very wide." 27 Some of the same material appears in her The Work of a Book Club (1937), a pamphlet that includes a biographical sketch of Granniss by Jean B. Barr (with a list of Granniss's writings). 28 See also A. W. Pollard, "Bibliographische Klubs in England," Zeitschrift für Bücher-freunde , 1 (1897), 99-101. 29 Other examples are the Historical Sketch of the Club of Odd Volumes (1950); Russell H. Anderson's The Rowfant Club: A History (1955); David Magee's The Hundredth Book: A Bibliography of the Publications of the Book Club of California &amp; a History of the Club (1958); Robert E. Spiller's The Philobiblon Club of Philadelphia: The First Eighty Years, 1893-1973 (1973); James Moran's The Double Crown Club: A History of Fifty Years (1974); Philip Ward and David Chambers's "Twenty-Five Years of the P.L.A. [Private Libraries Association]," Private Library , 3rd ser., 3 (1980), 116-122, 160-167; 4 (1981), 73-86; and Stephen Parks's The Elizabethan Club of Yale University and Its Library (1986), with a historical essay by Alan Bell. 30 One should turn to the latter list for a fuller record than I am providing here. For the other figures discussed below, as for Bradshaw, I am selective in my references but always mention checklists of writings by and about them. 31 My survey of the influence of Greg's "Rationale," which includes an analysis of the essay itself, is an example of a historical study that is also part of the analytical literature of the subject. See "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' and the Editing of American Literature," SB , 28 (1975), 167-229; this essay and the two later essays that continued the survey (in SB in 1981 and 1986) are now gathered in Textual Criticism since Greg: A Chronicle, 1950-1985 (1988). 32 A basic work, which appeared shortly after Housman's death, is A. S. F. Gow's A. E. Housman: A Sketch, together with a List of His Writings and Indexes to His Classical Papers (1936); other memoirs, including those by A. W. Pollard and R. W. Chambers, are collected in the Bromsgrove School publication Alfred Edward Housman (1936). The standard listing is John Carter and John Sparrow's A. E. Housman: An Annotated Hand-List (1952, the second of the Soho Bibliographies), now revised by William White as A. E. Housman: A Bibliography (1982). Henry Maas edited a substantial selection of The Letters of A. E. Housman (1971). For a guide to other writings about Housman, see the biography by Richard Perceval Graves ( A. E. Housman: The Scholar-Poet , 1979). (Some works on the history of editing the classics are mentioned in note 1 above.) 33 Before the New Bibliography, the editing of printed texts was not usually based on bibliographical investigations, and the history of earlier editing is therefore on the fringes of bibliographical history. But there has been considerable attention to Capell and other early editors of Shakespeare: e.g., Thomas R. Lounsbury, The First Editors of Shakespeare ( Pope and Theobald ) (1906); R. B. McKerrow, "The Treatment of Shakespeare's Text by His Earlier Editors, 1709-1768," Proceedings of the British Academy , 19 (1933), 89-122; Alice Walker, "Edward Capell and His Edition of Shakespeare," ibid. , 46 (1960), 131-145; S. K. Sen, Capell and Malone and Modern Critical Bibliography (1961); R. G. Moyles, "Edward Capell (1713-1781) as Editor of Paradise Lost," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , 6, part 4 (1975), 252-261. 34 Roland, "'Dry, Dusty, Tedious, Accursed, Hateful Bibliography': Osler and British Bibliography," in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine (see note 22 above), pp. 9-27; Barker, "Geoffrey Keynes," Book Collector , 31 (1982), 411-426 passim . See also Geoffrey Keynes: Tributes on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday (1961), which contains a checklist; and Mary Kingsbury, "Book Collector, Bibliographer, and Benefactor of Libraries: Sir William Osler," Journal of Library History , 16 (1981), 187-198. 35 Some examples of booksellers' recollections (besides Muir's and Randall's): James Lackington's Memoirs (1791) and Confessions (1804), Henry Stevens's Recollections of Mr. James Lenox of New York (1886), Walter T. Spencer's Forty Years in My Bookshop (1923), Charles E. Goodspeed's Yankee Bookseller (1937), Charles P. Everitt's The Adventures of a Treasure Hunter (1951), Maurice L. Ettinghausen's Rare Books and Royal Collectors (1966), Harold C. Holmes's Some Random Reminiscences (1967), E. Millicent Sowerby's Rare Books and Rare People [Voynich, Sotheby's, Rosenbach] (1967), David Low's " With All Faults " (1973), David Magee's Infinite Riches (1973), Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine B. Stern's Old &amp; Rare (1974) and Between Boards (1977), John H. Jenkins's Audubon and Other Capers (1976), Harry W. Schwartz's Fifty Years in My Bookstore (1977), H. P. Kraus's A Rare Book Saga (1978), O. F. Snelling's Rare Books and Rarer People [Hodgson's] (1982), and George Sims's The Rare Book Game (1985). Among collectors' memoirs, at least Henry R. Wagner's Collecting, Especially Books (1941) and Bullion to Books (1942) and Wilmarth Lewis's Collector's Progress (1951) and One Man's Education (1967) should be mentioned. Many valuable shorter pieces also exist—such as the four by Gordon N. Ray that form the first section of the forthcoming volume of his essays, Books as a Way of Life . A unique work in this field is the two-volume set ( Four Oaks Farm, Four Oaks Library , edited by Gabriel Austin, 1967) dealing with the collection formed by Donald and Mary Hyde and with its setting; essays by various hands cover different aspects of the library and the farm, some of those in the Farm volume making particularly clear the social context of scholarship —most notably Mary Hyde's essay on "The Guest Book" (pp. 38-86), generously illustrated with photographs of the visitors. Another essay of Mary Hyde's that conveys this same sense is "Grolier Watching by a Lady, 1943-1966," in Books and Prints, Past and Future (see note 22 above), pp. 1-13. 36 Such as S. H. Steinberg's in Proceedings of the British Academy , 53 (1967), 449-468; James Moran's in Monotype Recorder , 43 (1968); Brooke Crutchley's in Two Men: Walter Lewis and Stanley Morison at Cambridge (1968); those of Nicolas Barker, Douglas Cleverdon, and others in Stanley Morison, 1889-1967: A Radio Portrait (1969); and Douglas Cleverdon's in Stanley Morison and Eric Gill, 1925-1933 (1983). 37 For example, Victor Scholderer's Fifty Essays in Fifteenth- and Sixteenth-Century Bibliography (1966) and Essays in Honour of Victor Scholderer (1970), both edited by Dennis E. Rhodes, and A. F. Johnson's Selected Essays on Books and Printing , edited by P. H. Muir (1970). There is a list of biographical studies of scholars of incunabula ("Inkunabelforscher," pp. xxiii-xxv) in Der Buchdruck des 15. Jahrhunderts , edited by Erich von Rath (1929-36), a revision of which is in progress. 38 Few Americans before Bowers and Hinman have been mentioned here, particularly in connection with analytical bibliography and textual study. The earlier American tradition, which had emerged in the study of Americana, made little advance in analytical bibliography and indeed often neglected the physical analysis of books. For some discussion of this point, see my essay "The Bibliography and Textual Study of American Books," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 95 (1985), 113-151 (esp. 114-125), reprinted in Needs and Opportunities in the History of the Book: America, 1639-1876 , ed. David D. Hall and John B. Hench (1987), pp. 233-271. Some biographical accounts of figures in this tradition are Victor Hugo Paltsits, "Wilberforce Eames: A Bio-Bibliographical Narrative," in Bibliographical Essays: A Tribute to Wilberforce Eames (1924), pp. 1-26; Randolph G. Adams, "Henry Harrisse," in Three Americanists (1939), pp. 1-33; Edward G. Holley, Charles Evans, American Bibliographer (1963); Walter Muir Whitehill, "George Parker Winship," in Analecta Biographica (1969), pp. 1-14; the volume edited by Scott Bruntjen and M. L. Young on Douglas C. McMurtrie: Bibliographer and Historian of Printing (in the "Great Bibliographers" series, 1979); and Michael Winship, Hermann Ernst Ludewig: America's Forgotten Bibliographer (1986). For a historical sketch of the recording of Americana, see Thomas R. Adams, "Bibliotheca Americana: A Merry Maze of Changing Concepts," PBSA , 63 (1969), 247-260. A bibliographer who did regularly record the structure of books was Thomas J. Holmes, bibliographer of the Mathers; his autobiography is The Education of a Bibliographer (1957). 39 Greg also discussed the beginning of analytical bibliography, with special reference to Pollard, in "The Hamlet Texts and Recent Work in Shakespearian Bibliography," Modern Language Review , 14 (1919), 380-385. 40 Among the longest sketches are those on John Payne Collier (pp. 29-32), William Blades (pp. 38-40), William Carew Hazlitt (pp. 41-47), Alexander Dyce (pp. 47-49), and Falconer Madan (pp. 59-61). 41 See B. J. McMullin, "Indexing the Periodical Literature of Anglo-American Bibliography," SB , 33 (1980), 1-17; and G. T. Tanselle, "The Periodical Literature of English and American Bibliography," SB , 26 (1973), 167-191. In addition to the periodical indexes cited in these essays, there are some guides that list monographic as well as periodical contributions, such as T. H. Howard-Hill, Index to British Literary Bibliography (1969- ); Robin Myers, The British Book Trade from Caxton to the Present Day: A Bibliographical Guide (1973); and G. T. Tanselle, Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (1971). For individual areas of book production, there are some guides of uneven quality: B. H. Breslauer's The Uses of Bookbinding Literature (1986) is excellent (with both an essay and a listing), as is Gavin Bridson and Geoffrey Wakeman's Printmaking &amp; Picture Printing: A Bibliographical Guide to Artistic &amp; Industrial Techniques in Britain, 1750-1900 (1984); less satisfactory are the lists of Vito J. Brenni, such as Book Illustration and Decoration: A Guide to Research (1980), Bookbinding: A Guide to the Literature (1982), Book Printing in Britain and America: A Guide to the Literature and a Directory of Printers (1983), and The Art and History of Book Printing: A Topical Bibliography (1984). Irving Leif's An International Sourcebook of Paper History (1978) was given a substantial supplement shortly after its publication: Kate Frost, "Supplement to Leif: A Checklist of Watermark History, Production, and Reproduction Research," Direction Line , 8 (Spring 1979), 33-56. See also notes 15 and 20 above. 42 I am not suggesting that the concepts of bibliography and textual criticism are limited to objects carrying verbal messages; they have often been applied to musical texts and are increasingly being used in connection with films. But the bulk of bibliographical and textual work in the past has focused on the transmission of verbal messages; and there is no indication that verbal messages, in one form or another, will be less central to human affairs in the future.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Does "Text" Exist? by Louis Hay *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No it doesn't": on this note, Jacques Petit concluded the first debate dealing with the production of the text and with literary manuscripts, ten years ago. 1 Looking back, what strikes us about this comment is not so much its provocativeness (or rather resignation?) as simply its date. From this point onwards, the text started generating new questions. At the same time appeared a textual approach, called today genetic criticism ("critique génétique"), and it is interesting to take a closer look at the rapport between these two events. But in order to speak of both genesis and text, we need first of all to redefine these terms, or rather to understand their original meaning. And so we must go back much further than ten years. Historically, the notion of text has undergone a rather remarkable development, beginning with a long period of stability which was followed recently by a brief period of multiple mutations. The former period takes us back to the monastic Middle Ages, when by the 13th century in all European languages the word textus , meaning fabric, became text with the present accepted meaning for that term. At the beginning of the modern age, its meaning had remained unchanged. In the 1786 edition of the French Academy dictionary, it is defined as: "an author's own words, as opposed to notes, commentaries or glosses" ("les propres paroles d'un auteur, considérées par rapport aux notes, aux commentaires, aux gloses"), and the following example is given: "The text of Holy Scripture. It is the pure, formal text. To restore a text." ("Le texte de l'Ecriture Sainte. C'est le text pur et formel. Restituer un texte.") 2 Two contrasting notions are thus sharply distinguished: the text ("the author's own words") as opposed to the gloss ("notes, commentaries"). Each of these notions has precisely defined functions. The text is "pure and formal"—its very form guarantees the pureness of its meaning, and the conditions of social transmission ensure its spiritual legitimacy. At the same time the functions of gloss are defined: phiology guards over the literal accuracy, it has to "restore the text"; the commentary is in charge of meaning. The reference to Holy Scripture reminds us that what is implied in such an arrangement is a distinction between the sacred and the profane. The critical edition, even secularised, has always remained faithful to its original calling—to this day it claims to carry the word of righteousness, and to reinforce the legitimacy of text. The definitions were all the more firmly rooted, given that for centuries they formed the accepted tradition in all European cultures. The German Adelung dictionary echoes its contemporary, the French Academy dictionary: "The words of an author as distinct from their interpretation (. . .) in this way the passages of the Bible underlying the sermon are most specifically considered texts". ("Die Worte eines Schriftstellers, zum Unterschiede zu der Auslegung derselben (. . .) in welchem Verstande besonders die biblischen Stellen über welche gepredigt wird, Texte heissen."). 3 Charles Richardson's dictionary in Great Britain, though of later date, maintains the definition without noteworthy change: "A composition in writing, opposed to the notes or annotations." An example is given from Chaucer: "in plain text, withouten nede of glose", and the authors specify: "Text is technically applied to any passage quoted from the text of Scripture, as a subject of discourse or sermon." 4 This canonical understanding persists unchanged throughout a long period of cultural revolution. More than a century after the French Academy dictionary, Pierre Larousse uses a virtually unchanged definition, despite the generally distinctive perspective of his dictionary: "An author's own writing as opposed to the commentaries (. . .) The text of Holy Scripture (. . .) To restore the text." ("Propres paroles d'un auteur par opposition aux commentaires (. . .) Le texte de l'Ecriture Sainte (. . .) Restituer un texte.") 5 As the only signs of the times, as it were, it cites "the text of Plato" alongside the Bible, and mentions "translations" in contrast to the text. At around the same time, the monumental Grimm Brother's Wörterbuch gives the definition: "the original, fundamental, 'ur'-text, as opposed to the translation (. . .) the substantive words of a piece of writing as opposed to commentaries or interpretations: in the strict sense verse reference (Biblical text) from a sermon or speech." ("der Original-Grund-Urtext im Gegensatz zur Übersetzung (. . .) die Hauptworte einer Schrift im Gegensatz zu den Erläuterungen und Anmerkungen, im engeren Sinne der Grundspruch (Bibeltext) einer Predigt oder Rede.") 6 And leaping ahead one more century to the present day, the same strict frame of reference remained unchanged up until a decade ago. "An author's own words, a law (as opposed to the commentaries)" ("Propres termes qu'on lit dans un auteur, une loi (par opposition aux commentaires)")—thus the definition in the 1964 edition of the Grand Larousse . 7 And in 1973, in the Brockhaus : "the words of a piece of writing or a lecture; Biblical passage underlying a sermon." ("Wortlaut eines Schriftwerkes, eines Vortrags; die der Predigt zugrunde gelegte Bibelstelle.") 8 To the best of my knowledge, the first dictionary to mark a change is Le Robert , where as early as 1966 "literary work" ("oeuvre littéraire") is included in the definition, and "a well-written text" ("texte bien écrit") is used as an example. 9 Such uses are carefully identified as neologisms, however. A good indication of the rapid subsequent development can be seen by comparing the timidity of this entry with Julia Kristeva's imperious statement barely six years later: "We can no longer speak of 'literature' in general, but of the text ." 10 However the entry in Le Robert is interesting because of its date: 1966 also saw the appearance of Structural Semantics ( Sémantique structurale ) by A. L. Greimas, George Poulet's Three Essays ( Trois essais ) and Gérard Genette's Figures I . It is remarkable, too, since this new dictionary was the work of a team of young linguists and semioticians, and the influence of the theories they represented was to be the motor of impending developments. As Roland Barthes later remarked: "It was at the height of structural linguistics (around 1960) that new researchers, themselves often the product of a linguistic training, began to formulate a critical approach to the sign and a new theory of the text." 11 At the same time, the direction of research was to vary from country to country, thus causing the sense of the term to fragment. It was no longer possible to discuss "the text" in an international forum without first establishing one's own definition of the term. In Germany, and to a lesser extent in the United States, a novel assessment arose around editorial enterprises. Attention shifted from the gloss to the text when editors faced the problems of textual genesis by means of the apparatus of variants. It was from this angle that critics like Beda Alleman and especially Peter Szondi in Germany, or Vinton Dearing in the United States and Philip Gaskell in Great Britain, turned their interest to the problems of text production. But at the time there was no exchange with other theoretical approaches—neither the Anglo-American "new criticism" nor the German "Textlinguistik". In France, matters took a somewhat different turn, since a new current of criticism developed based largely on linguistic models. As Barthes put it: "A wide literary field has gone over to linguistics under the heading of poetics (a displacement which Valéry had recognised as necessary)." 12 In this critical approach, the text itself is the focus of attention, situated between "the author's own words" and the eyes of the reader, but considered above all as an autonomous object. The aim of the critic is to build up the text as a scientific object to analyse with precision its constitutive system of forms, significations and functions. Despite its relatively limited lifespan (essentially from the late fifties to the early seventies), this innovative critical movement was to have long-felt consequences. And although, on the level of discourse, systems of textual syntax or semantics could not be established on the analogy of models developed by formal linguistics, a certain number of concepts, such as sign, structure or function, became increasingly articulate in theoretical works that brought about an irreversible renewal in literary criticism. Yet somehow this widespread movement remained closely tied to its first origins, almost as by an umbilical cord. The new critical theory still assumed the classical notion of text, the "pure, formal text", incommensurable and opposed to anything not itself, albeit this opposition was no longer founded on a religious tradition but on an epistemological exigency: the closure of the text. As Michel Arrivé remarked (in 1978, and thus with a certain distance): "In structuralism, the text is considered as a finished product (. . .) categorically distinct from the pre-text and the post-text which remain peripheral (though they are both to be found within the work which thus seems to include the text, the pre-text and the post-text)." He also pointed out amongst the numerous ambiguities of such a postulate the "intricate question of the relations between such terms as discourse, text and narrative". 13 In today's light it is easy to discover the indication of a fundamental problem within this terminological ambiguity: that is to say the application of a new theory to an old object. Once again Roland Barthes was first to recognise the need for a second theoretical step designed to create a new object. In the early seventies, this was the goal of the theory of the text , which takes into account the social dimension by means of historical materialism , and the personality, by means of psychoanalysis . The interchange between these two fields creates a vast theoretical network whose pattern cannot be examined in this paper. One result however was the emergence of the double notion of pheno-text/geno-text, borrowed from Soviet linguists by French semioticians. In 1972 Julia Kristeva was the first to present the pheno-text as "a finished product: an utterance with a meaning". As such it is the empirical manifestation of the geno-text, "an infinite syntactic and/or semantic generation (. . .) which cannot be reduced to the generated structure." 14 In this construction, the deepest reality of the text lies in its productivity, "the limitless possible operations", not in the product itself. With Barthes' neat comment "The Work is in your hand, the text in the language", the terms as originally canonized were completely inverted. The boundaries disappeared, not only between pretext, text and post-text, but also between writing and criticism. Both became subject to infinite significations. Due perhaps to this circularity, the theory of the text provoked a new problematic rather than concrete applications, since it no longer assigned a specific function to criticism. * This situation is in sharp contrast with a second critical approach which also took form at the beginning of the seventies, known as genetic criticism. This second current is contemporary with the theory of the text , and alike deals with the relationship between the text and its genesis, and with the mechanics of text production, the activity of the writing subject. But there, all resemblance ends. Both the method and the object of study of genetic criticism are quite distinct. Its method is the result of extensive empirical work dedicated to authors' manuscripts. It appeared progressively that these documents, under certain conditions, allowed to reconstruct the genesis of writing. Genetic criticism retains from its origins an inductive approach, which builds up general models from a series of concrete observations. As for its object, it has a dual status: it is both a material given, as a document of study, and an intellectual construction, as a pre-text. From the graphic pattern of writing immobilised by the pen and scattered over the page it is possible to reconstruct the process of creation and thought through a fully conceived sequence of analytic operations: deciphering, establishing the chronology, seizing the writing in its moves. 15 In this way, genetic criticism has to consider first the manuscript, then the writing, before finally getting back to the text on a new level. The principal merit of manuscripts is that they demonstrate the limitations and possibilities of genetic criticism. From the outset there are important material limitations: it is impossible to study a nonexistent manuscript. In this regard, Monsieur de la Palice reminds us of the fragile process of text transmission which today we tend to overlook. Our notion of European literature would be radically different however were it not for the fortuitous survival of such unique manuscripts as Pascal's Thoughts ( Pensées ) or the Urfaust by Goethe, Lucien Leuwen or Kafka's great novels. Likewise, how different would it be had we inherited the great works which have disappeared, whose ghost-list we can barely establish? Coupled with the caprices of history are the imponderables of the human mind. Even the most detailed and well-conserved documentation reveals but a fraction of the complicated mental processes to which it bears witness. The ink on the page is not the writing itself. One need only meet a contemporary writer, with evidence in hand from his manuscripts that one has had a chance to study, to be effectively cured of any presumptions one may have had to the contrary. But manuscripts also give a new power to literary critics. They make it possible to examine how the pen works in its irrefutable material presence. In this way they manifest a level of reality to which no speculative interpretation can penetrate and possess a material richness that no effort of analysis can hope to exhaust. This becomes even clearer when we realise that manuscripts by their singular properties force us to change our habits of thought. They force us to take into account the unpredictable, since our knowledge changes every time an important document is discovered or a new technology gives access to previously unknown information. Likewise we must come to grips with their heterogeneity, since they are diverse by nature: sometimes they are the testimony of the original stimulation, sometimes the record of the remote memory like notes, notebooks or diaries; sometimes they document early operations like projects, workplans or scenarios, sometimes they are the instruments of revision such as sketches, early versions and most often rough drafts. Their polymorph structure is yet another challenge, as manuscripts have no respect for the convention of linearity, overflowing the page into multiple spaces. The ways in which the text is laid out on the page, with marginal notations, additions, cross-references, deletions, alterations, in different handwriting styles, and with drawings and symbols, texture the discourse, increase the significations and multiply the possible readings. In extreme cases, a single word isolated by the writing (Jean Levaillant called them "keystones" in reference to the manuscripts of Paul Valéry: to look, shine, incest) 16 can attract the meaning of an entire page. Or in the notebooks for Finnegans Wake , for example, a single iconic mark may determine the theme, the character, or the mythical entity which will govern the function of a certain set of words. 17 It is easy to see how thoroughly our analytic habits are shaken by the very contact with the material of genetic criticism. This is even more the case when we pass from the original material to an intellectual construction. The constitution of the pre-text from handwriting which is both solidified and polymorphous implies a new type of reading which must take into consideration the totality of semantic and semiotic significations to be found in a page of writing. In this way a truly dialectic relationship is established between the document and the pre-text: each transcription of the manuscript is shaped by the vision one has of it, but at the same time this vision has to be modified by the reality of the object to be turned into an adequate representation of it. This relationship and this polarity are evident in the diversity of the methods used to make textual genesis readable. Henri Bonnet and Bernard Brun, in dealing with Proust's manuscripts, try to clear the ground for a continuous reading, thus offering a spectrum of pre-texts in contiguity. 18 On the other hand, Dietrich Sattler attempts to reconstruct the depth of field of genesis in Hölderlin's manuscripts, and presents the witnesses to the stages of revision in their chronological sequence. 19 For Joyce or Kafka, Hans Walter Gabler or Gerhard Neumann both try to embrace these two aspects simultaneously, thus publishing the genesis in its process and the final state of the text side by side or alternately. 20 Each of these choices testifies to the diversity of manuscripts as well as to that of the theoretical options of the editor. But they all mark their distance from the traditional apparatus of variants, abandoning the viewpoint of pure erudition for the problematic of the pre-text. This problematic is obviously multi-faceted. In defining the pre-text as a constructed object, one must accept the existence of a variety of possible constructions—a fact true both for writing theories and for editorial practices. An examination of the scope of such theoretical possibilities would necessitate a general overview of genetic studies, which is not the object of this paper. Rather, in order to clarify the status of the text, alone in question here, we will satisfy ourselves with a look at the two prime analytic models which deal with the two aspects of writing, production and product. Text production brings forth two new types of approach. The first is strictly analytic, attempting to identify and describe the combination of transfers, substitutions, extensions and reductions manifest in manuscripts, in order to apprehend the whole gamut of genetic operations and put them into a system: programmation, textualisation, transformation. The second approach is inductive. Its aim is to trace back these operations to the dynamic forces which actuate them: affective impulses, representations of imagination, linguistic or rhythmic values. . . . The study of the product has more substantial support. Each in turn, new criticism , werkimmanente Interpretation and French structuralism have offered models for examining the forms, significations and effects of the text. The new problem, the implications of which remain unknown, concerns the relationship between the genetic approach and the textual approach, a problem which we will deal with as modestly as possible, beginning with a return to terminology. In 1974 Jean Bellemin-Noël created the immediately successful term "avant-texte", or "pre-text", to encompass the great variety of documents which until then had had no specific nomenclature. 21 Being in full accordance with the creative singularity of the French language, this term gave birth, by symmetry, to a number of subsequent terms, including the still surviving "après-texte", or "post-text". But by creating the pair "text" and "pre-text", the old binary opposition between text and non-text was rekindled, and a theoretical problem articulated. Trying to define this problem, Jean Bellemin-Noël commented in his Essays on Generative Criticism ( Essais de critique génétique (1979)): "The difference between The Text (finished, in other words: published) and the pre-text is that the former offers itself as an entity spellbound in its destiny, whereas the latter holds and reveals its own history." 22 It is clear that this definition, both dense and subtle, favours objective definitions: the text is considered achieved when published, and its own determination—meaning both integrity and durability—is the result of this social destiny. Other factors can also be distinguished in the background: the author's intention which becomes manifest in the act of publication, and the internal coherence of the work, its "unity". We might simply add the act of reading which each time brings the text to existence—and in so doing we rediscover the criteria according to which the text is normally defined: the author, the work, the reader, the society. Each of these elements is the object of much debate, which I shall not attempt to reproduce here. But the difficulty of ascribing a general function to any of them can be understood by a brief look at certain ranges of evidence. Invoking the social aspect of the text means placing it within an historical context, which at the same time brings into question the fluctuation of cultural norms and the variations of our own criteria. We now accept as texts many works which in the 19th century or even at the beginning of this century would have been regarded as mere files (such as the work of Arno Schmidt), rough drafts (the writing of Francis Ponge, for example), or collages of quotations (such as the early work of Philippe Sollers)—not to mention the archetype of Finnegans Wake which was called a "cross-word puzzle fanatic's Bible" by its contemporaries before becoming a prototype for present-day writing. And it is clear that a look at periods other than our own would give similar results. Next to consider the function of reading is even more telling, since it does not exclusively rest in the accidents of history. By its very nature, the act of reading converts its object into a text. It is well-known how Mallarmé conceived of reading in absolute terms, considering any visual focal point as text including the countryside one might see in lifting one's eyes from one's book. But remaining within the written world, we easily mark that it is the act of reading which allows us to go from the manuscript to the pre-text, and which sometimes weakens the distinction between manuscript and text. Such is especially the case when rough drafts are presented for reading—a practice which, with the recent publication of literary manuscripts in editions, now concerns the general public. In turn, the contingencies of history and of reading call into question the structural coherence of the text. This is an objective criterion in so far as it is based on the laws which govern the language. Yet these laws, and even proper grammar, are far better respected in the rough sketches of Flaubert and Proust than in the final texts of Céline or Joyce. Such a consideration does not nullify the criterion of coherence, but rather acts as an incentive to place it in relation to the other variable determining factors. The last among these to be questioned is the writing subject, that is, the author, whose decision it is to cut the umbilical cord of the genesis, ushering the pre-text into the text. The writing subject, of course, is the most evident and perhaps the surest of the criteria for textuality, in that it conjoins an individual determination and a social reality; in any case it is the easiest to handle. But it is not an absolute criterion. Its two constituent parts are far from being always related. Either the author's intention is defeated by economic or political obstacles ("A whole brood of birdlings chirping in my head / Books good for confiscation", as Heinrich Heine put it, making himself the mouthpiece of many of his contemporaries in Germany: A Winter's Tale ), or on the contrary, the work is published against the author's desire, or posthumous desire as was the case with Kafka. But even when such is not the case, the relationship between what is non-published and what is published is as diverse as are the ways of writing: from Claude Simon who destroys his manuscripts after publication, to Julien Gracq who guards them under lock and key; from Aragon who gave his manuscripts to researchers, to Francis Ponge who closes the circle by publishing his rough drafts, thus transforming the pre-text into text. * Clearly none of the criteria of textuality is in itself a constant certain factor, nor can such certainty be established by putting them all together. The history of the text, its internal coherence, the act of reading and the author's design do not constitute a system. We have no four-faced prism which allows us infallibly to consider a given literary work as a text, and the search for such an instrument would undoubtedly be as futile as was that for the ultimate criterion of literariness. Must we simply conclude that the text does not exist? It seems to me that it should be sufficient to agree that there is no absolute definition. And the above-mentioned criteria remain operative as long as we accept them as parameters in a variable field registering ever-differing realisations of the act of writing. Not The Text , but texts. And so I prefer to modify the concept and vocabulary in order to take a new look, not at the opposition between pretext and text, but at the relationship between writing and the written work. Today, this relationship strikes us as being profoundly contradictory, undoubtedly because of the difficulty which we still have in understanding it. As we have just seen, it is impossible to separate categorically the act of writing from the written work. But likewise, it is impossible to confuse them one with the other. Between creative process which operates through repetition, contiguity, extensions and retractions, and the deployment of the text, there is no possible correspondence. On the contrary: experience has shown that the process of writing cannot be conjectured by studying the text to which it nevertheless gave birth. The trip backwards, from the text to the manuscript, is full of discoveries and often astonishment: one's expectations are foiled. The process of writing is of a different nature than the written word. This difference is not disturbing as long as one seeks simply to describe the genetic process. Such an approach is well suited to dealing with heterogeneous conditions, since it functions from a base of displacements, substitutions and transformations, not stopping short at the text itself which is considered only as a stage of the genetic process. It matters little that the text should be seen as the outcome of preceding stages or considered merely within a set of many alternative versions. The difficulty arises when one tries to integrate the generative dimension within the study of the text. It is easy enough to say that the writing is always active within the written work, that "the ghosts of successive books", as Julien Gracq puts it, continue to inhabit the finished work which remains situated "in their light". 23 But how does the writing shed light on the text? And what can the one tell us about the other? Faced with this problem, I will once again make a slight detour by making two comments. The first concerns our reflection—or should I say our lack of reflection?—on the question of the author. The writing subject has little place in modern criticism, fallen into disrepute first because of the banality of biographical commentaries, and subsequently removed from the text by the strict theoretical approach of formal analysis. Yet he resurges today as the subject of new questioning. In dealing with writing, criticism inevitably encounters the moment of the writing itself. It is stretched out between the author's life and the sheet of paper like a drumskin on which the pen beats its message. The echo we receive is but incomplete, yet reveals the complexity of the act itself, not to mention its contradictions. These contradictions come not only from the fact that writing tends alternately (and sometimes simultaneously) towards communicating and holding back, but also from the contiguous use of imagination and meditated calculation. This dynamic opposition creates a polarity configuration which seems to be inherent in writing, a state which influences as much the concepts we use for dealing with the text as it does our understanding of the text itself. To begin with, our concept of the work. For Kafka, for example, we possess a series of notebooks, of "writing" in which he has attempted to delimit and form entities—in other words, "works"—yet with great difficulty, judging by the successive presentation of about fifteen stories, other units of text that remained unpublished, and yet other textual segments for which hesitations even as to their actual status (narrative? aphoristic?) are indicated. Comparably, though in different ways, both the files from which Leiris composes his writing and the manuscripts which Aragon arranged in order to create Théâtre / Roman bear witness to such a conflict between the flow of the writing and the fixity of the work itself. From here we can undoubtedly advance in our consideration of the cohesiveness or fragmentation of an oeuvre —that is to say, the total production of a given author. And of course the concepts of intertextuality or historicity can also be evaluated through an author's working in that it helps us to elucidate the documents, observations and experiences which fed it. Nevertheless this dialectic appears in each author in a different way. Writing subjects are always unique, and this uniqueness constantly causes entanglements in the generalising tendencies of literary criticism. Which means, undoubtedly, that we must diversify our approach in order to understand our subject better—not only in order to take the author into consideration once again, but also in order to consider his writing in a new way. This is the point of my second comment. The analysis of meanings, forms and effects tends to treat the text as a system resulting from one single law, in such a way that none of its parts can be changed without affecting the whole. With this in mind, let us take a look at Paul Eluard's famous poem: Sur mes cahiers d'ecolier On my school notebooks Sur mon pupitre et les arbres On my desk and on the trees Sur le sable sur la neige On the sand and on the snow J'écris ton nom I write your name It is easy to see how this text is triggered off and kept in movement, almost magnetised by one word which appears only as the incipit and excipit of the long poem of 21 stanzas: Et par le pouvoir d'un mot And by the power of one word Je recommence ma vie I begin my life again Je suis né pour te connaître I was born to know you Pour te nommer To name you Liberté. Liberty. What happens when we learn from the manuscript that this word is the result of a late correction (and that the author reveals to us the name of his beloved which was in its place)? Once again the answer will vary according to our approach to the text. For the historian, nothing changes: it was the theme of liberty which accounted for the poem's national success at the time of the Liberation, and no manuscript could change the phenomenon of collective enthusiasm which now belongs to literary history. For the Eluard specialist, interpretation of this work is clarified and verified. The substitution of the words attests to the relationship between the themes—and in this case it is the rapport between life and political commitment which was to determine the course of this poem. From a textual point of view things are more complex. It is true that the laws of structure are upheld: by changing a single word the entire poem is altered. Liberté is neither a variant nor even another version of the poem composed for Nusch—it is a different poem. But at the same time the perspective of genesis shows us that this first, distinct work was one of the possibilities of the text, though it was neither integrated nor subsumed in the second work. In other words, the writing is not simply consummated in the written work. Perhaps we should consider the text as a necessary possibility , as one manifestation of a process which is always virtually present in the background, a kind of third dimension of the written work. In this open (or half-open) space, the work is fatefully tossed between impetuous forward movements and calms of exhaustion, between stammerings and lacunae, from interruptions to unachievements that keep bringing us off course. The text is not annihilated by the weight of its possibilities but rather it stands out as an object which is far more complex than our former conceptions and far more aleatory than our modern ones. The effects of the upheaval caused by genetic criticism are only beginning to be felt. They will undoubtedly be consequential to research in the years to come.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Script, Work and Published Form: Franz Kafka's Incomplete Text by Gerhard Neumann *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My topic is one which extends beyond the field of editorship in the strict sense and impinges on the theory of literary interpretation. For I should like to try to extend the concept of 'incompleteness' beyond the sphere of manuscripts to embrace as well the idea of the literary work and that of its 'published form'. I do not know whether this problem is of general relevance. But with Kafka it seems to me essential to widen the concept of 'incompleteness' beyond what it commonly signifies. This is something of which I have been convinced as a result of my work on the critical Kafka edition. I shall therefore attempt to show how the peculiar nature of Kafka's 'incomplete text' is manifest firstly in the manuscripts, secondly in the way the work is constituted and lastly in the context of those works published in Kafka's lifetime. I believe there is no other author in the German language who offers us greater problems of understanding when we try to define 'text', 'work' and, indeed, 'authorship' itself so as to do him justice. This is essentially a reflection of the peculiar nature of Kafka's creativity which shows itself in what one might call an inner dividedness. I shall explain what I mean by this term. This will mean looking at the problematical nature of his literary production under four headings. Firstly : the ambivalences towards the act of writing, which are very common among modern authors, develop in Kafka's case into conflicting opposites: on the one hand, the uncompromising retreat to a position which affirms the act of writing as something wholly individual and private; on the other, the desire to gain literary fame and to impinge on the world of letters. Secondly : these tensions are made more pronounced by certain dissonances within the historical relation of Kafka's work to its readership. While Kafka largely owes his standing as a world literary figure to his novels, he himself had a very low opinion of them and published none. He believed that, if he were to achieve fame at all, then it would be through his short prose pieces. Thirdly : the conflict attending the transmission of the manuscripts to us, the unrealised intentions of the author with regard to their publication. Kafka's friend, Max Brod, discovered a last will and testament of the author, which reads as follows: Dear Max, perhaps I shall not leave this bed ever again; after this last month of inflammation of the lungs, pneumonia is a fair probability, and not even writing the fact down will avert it—although writing it does have a certain power. For the worst eventuality therefore, this is my last will with regard to everything I have written: Of all that I have written, only the following has any validity: the books: Judgement, Stoker, Metamorphosis, Penal Colony, Country Doctor and the story: Hunger Artist. (The few copies of Meditation can be left, I do not wish to put anyone to the trouble of pulping them, but nothing from the volume is to be reprinted.) When I say that these five books and the story have validity, I do not mean by this that I want them to be reprinted and transmitted to future generations; on the contrary: should they be lost entirely, then this would correspond to my real desire. It is merely that I would not wish to obstruct anyone in their preservation, should he wish to preserve them, since they are, after all, there. On the other hand, anything else written by me that may still exist (whether printed in periodicals, still in manuscript or in letters) to the extent that it is still available or can be recovered by asking the correspondents (you know who most of them are, and . . . has most of the material, and in particular do not forget the couple of note books in the possession of . . .)—all of this is without exception and preferably unread (but I shall not forbid you to have a look at it, although I would really prefer you didn't, and on no account is anyone else to set eyes on it)—all of it is without exception to be burned and I ask you to do this as soon as possible, Franz [P. 316-318] 1 By instructing his best friend to destroy the manuscripts, Kafka effectively placed him in a double bind. By giving Max Brod, whose devotion to him made it likely that he would, in fact, not obey the instruction, the task of destroying the manuscripts, Kafka was really saying: carry out my command by ignoring it . A fourth instance of conflict follows on from this and concerns the production of the texts Kafka actually meant to publish. Kafka himself prepared very few of his own texts for the press. They can be assembled in a single volume of the critical edition ( Drucke zu Lebzeiten ). The remainder of the manuscripts remained unpublished in Kafka's lifetime, and therefore the whole of the rest of his work presents the problems typical of a posthumous edition. Max Brod had a difficult role to play in the process of publication, the more so as his aim was to make as many texts of Kafka as possible into 'works'. He published the novels as if they were complete; he extracted finished or half-finished texts from the manuscripts, gave them titles of his own and thus made them into 'works'. But it had been Kafka's express wish that these texts should never be published, and thus should never be made into 'works' in the classical sense. This is a dilemma that our edition must confront and resolve; but, as well, the dilemma itself must remain a visible reality for the reader. Certain consequences result from this wealth of conflicts. It should, at any rate, be clear that the simple division into "posthumous works' and 'works published by the author' could not do justice to the situation, since in the case of Kafka these two areas are related to one another in complex and subtle ways. I shall attempt to contrive a confrontation of the problems of one area with those of the other. Firstly, the problems of the posthumous edition: It is a peculiarity of Kafka's way of writing that it is governed by the antithetical principles of flux and inhibition, of—if you like: inundation and drought. The alternation of the one with the other was determined not only in the private sphere but also within that which social psychology has made its province. The cultural ritual that is writing includes both possibilities. On the one hand it paves the way to maturity and individual independence; on the other hand, this path to freedom must be learned in school as compulsion and discipline. Whenever Kafka writes, this duality, this contradictory linking of freedom and compulsion, comes into its own. Kafka is a paradigmatic example of the problems of the middle-class individual in his quest for identity—a quest that takes place against the background of a stern pedagogical discipline. Kafka was acutely aware of this himself, and again and again in his work turned a fundamental incompatibility between living and writing into the stuff of his writing. Thus he never tires of expounding the problem of the 'birth of the individual' into society, of the process that leads from the strictures of life within the family into the relative freedom of society at large. Again and again, Kafka poses the question: can artistic creation offer such a path to freedom? One that leads out of the constraints of discourse within the family into a wider social and cultural milieu? This constant antithesis of compulsion and freedom led in Kafka's case to two different forms of production. On the one hand, there is a creative state that is almost unconscious, dream-like, and which results in some texts turning out to be virtually definitive when first written down. On the other hand, there are what I call 'thickets of scratchings out' that spring up when the internal censor has been active and when the thread of creativity has broken and could not be joined again. 2 Secondly, the problems of editing those works Kafka saw through the press: The relationship of script and printed word is, in Kafka's case, particularly fraught with difficulty. While he felt handwriting to be something congenial to the life of the body, he always experienced the printed word as a distancing from the body, indeed as its elimination, which, in turn, leads to the ultimate survival of the script in the transmuted form of the book. An example from Kafka's writing is the text entitled A Dream which belongs to the complex of The Trial . In this fragment, Josef K.'s body sinks into the earth while his name flashes in a strong, ornate script across the tombstone above him. This structure reflects a cultural issue, namely the ambivalent role of writing within the process by which the individual acquires an identity. For this process is guided on the one hand by the body and on the other by a conglomerate of social codes. As an expression of the body, writing appears as something unique, bearing the unmistakable and inalienable stamp of individuality. This is something which, incidentally, accounts for the market prices of autograph manuscripts. The negative obverse of this is the ready reproduction of such unique scripts through the machines we all have at our disposal. From the perspective of society and its codes, writing appears in a different guise: on the one hand, it partakes of the anonymity of social discourse, on the other, it manifests itself in the positive concept of authorship. Authorship means the legitimation of the individual in terms of legal and economic structures. The situation Kafka faces when writing can thus be seen as a general cultural problem. We may describe this as the individual's dilemma as to where to seek or to locate his identity: in the untidy scribblings of the manuscripts or in the 'luxury editions' of which Kafka himself was always so fond. This is the central problem confronting the self that sets out to acquire legitimacy in an age dominated by the written word. Shall it be attained by the purely 'intimate self', defined by the fact that feelings are private and inalienable, and are mirrored as such by the handwritten text? Or shall it be achieved as a 'public individual', determined by the opinions of others and by the effects of one's own printed works within the cultural sphere that guarantees the personal unity of 'authorship'? The real problem of modern authorship can be summed up in the question: how can the one experience of subjectivity be transmuted into the other? How can the fluid situation of the manuscript be converted into the static one of the literary work? In general it is a process of segmentation, of dissecting the script in a way that will be to the advantage of the future work. In this act of dissection the intimacy of the creative flow cannot help but be converted into the public phenomenon that is the literary work. Over the decades, the problematic figure of 'Kafka the author' has been shaped on this basis. It was Max Brod who set the process in motion when he transformed the novels, which Kafka himself thought of as failures, into finished documents and works of World Literature. As against Brod's practice, one must never lose sight of the fact that Kafka put most value on his collections of short narrative pieces. These he arranged carefully within each volume, and thus created new structures of meaning through their positioning. In a sense, this was Kafka's attempt to work against the closed 'work structure' of the individual printed text. He saw this structure, but wanted to re-open it by combining several such texts into a sequence suggestive of a new flow of creativity. Our Kafka edition attempts to do justice to these contradictory factors. I should now like to discuss three areas of our editorial work where they have been significant. The first area is that of the critical apparatus of the edition and our attempt to adapt the reproduction of the text to reflect the different modes of composition, which means, in effect, using both the linear and the stereometric presentation of variants as the need arises. In the last analysis it is the editor's own decision as to which method is appropriate. I offer a simple example to make this clear: B Presentation of variants : 61 20 linear : wie er flüchtig feststellte] &lt;wie (ich&gt;er) flüchtig feststellte&gt; H 61 20 in stages : ___] (1) &lt;wie ich flüchtig feststellte&gt; (2) wie (ich&gt;er) flüchtig feststellte C Interventions of the editor : 61 20 hatte,] hatte feststellte,] feststellte D Edited text : [Page 61, line 20] Olga hatte, wie er flüchtig feststellte, doch den Weg zu ihrem Bekannten gefunden. A second problem which the edition has to face is that of the relationship of the manuscript to the printed text. This means taking account of the dialectical interaction of the flow of creativity, on the one hand, with the closed structure of the finished work as it is manifest throughout the whole of Kafka's work on the other. Here we have adopted the solution of the 'double edition'. Texts which exist both as part of the creative flow within a manuscript and which were also lifted out of it by Kafka himself and prepared for the press are to be printed twice, once as components of a larger context, namely the manuscript, and then a second time as 'works' published separately. One example of this is the famous parable from The Trial Before the Law , which is in the first instance embedded in the manuscript of the novel, but which was also published by Kafka as the only part of the novel to be printed in his lifetime. A third problem is that of representing within the edition the way in which Kafka went about determining the printed form of those works he did publish. The point of view I wish to defend here is that even those texts Kafka was willing to publish do not constitute 'finished works' in the normal sense. Rather, their ordering is meant to preserve the character of the 'open text', as does the manuscript that reflects the process of composition. This is obvious when we consider that all the work Kafka published himself is subject to the dual principles of segmenting and integration. There are various texts which he first published singly, for example in a periodical, then as part of a small group of texts in another periodical, then as part of a collection, and finally as a single text extracted from this complex and republished. The following figure illustrates the second collection of texts which Kafka published himself: A Country Doctor . From it we see, for example, that Kafka first published the two texts Jackals and Arabs and Report for an Academy singly, then together in a periodical Der Jude and finally together with twelve other pieces in the collection A Country Doctor . It is important to recognise that, while each of these texts can be understood by itself, they do have a common field of reference when paired, namely the problem of attaining an identity in the context of cultural systems. As well, we can see them forming an intertextual structure with the other stories in the volume A Country Doctor , and we can try and reconstruct this through precise interpretation. I have, in fact, tried to do this in various essays. 3 As editor, one can only deal with this phenomenon by adding a commentary. One cannot reproduce all the various contexts of a single text in extenso within the edition. It would be far too costly. Therefore we need a commentary to draw the reader's attention to the patterning of themes and motifs created by such juxtapositions. We must ensure that the reader becomes aware of the 'open' character of this collection of texts. This means we must demonstrate its incompleteness. Our edition will endeavour to present the changing configurations of the printed texts as clearly as possible, using tables similar to the one reproduced above. These indications should suffice to show that the problem of the 'open' text, of 'unfinished writing' is present on all levels of Kafka's work. It is evident in the manuscripts in the alternation of the flowing and drying up of the stream of creativity; it is evident in the relationship of manuscript to printed text once we show the process of segmentation; finally it is evident in the way in which Kafka published, that is: in the way he arranged single texts into groups and collections. I should now like to give individual examples of all of these instances, starting with the manuscripts. The first problem is how to show the various stages in the composition of a text, specifically those places where the creative flow dries up and various levels of correction overlay one another. There are two main contexts in Kafka's works where complications occur in shaping the text and where it frequently breaks off: this happens on the one hand, where the text becomes metaphorical and, on the other, where passages of an explanatory or interpretative nature are found. As an instance of the complications that arise from metaphor, I should like to take part of Building the Great Wall of China . The example shows very clearly how the 'incompleteness' of a text is rooted in the difficulty of finding precise metaphors for the ideas seeking expression. In this story Kafka sets out to depict a collective identity, which supplants that of the individuals making up the Chinese people. It was written in that phase of his creativity when he was prone to replace his earlier images of the family and of its power to create identity with fantasies of collective identity. The underlying issue is, once more, that of European subjectivity between the conflicting claims of private and public spheres. It is important to note that Kafka purports to survey these problems with the distanced regard of the anthropologist. Within this fantasy of collective identity, the point is reached where the identity of the people needs to be legitimised. Within our own cultural framework this would normally be achieved by invoking the concept of a purely 'representative' power as it developed within the feudal system: as the 'ideal' subject of the ruler who in turn validates the existence of the other members of the body politic. This idea is expressed by Kafka himself at one point and, significantly, in metaphorical guise. If we take the last stage of the manuscript version and leave aside all previous crossings-out, the text reads: Wenn man aus solchen Erscheinungen folgern wollte, daβ wir im Grunde gar keinen Kaiser haben, wäre man von der Wahrheit nicht weit entfernt. Immer wieder muβ ich sagen: Es gibt vielleicht kein kaisertreueres Volk als das unsrige im Süden, aber die Treue kommt dem Kaiser nicht zugute. Zwar steht auf der kleinen Säule am Dorfausgang der heilige Drache und bläst huldigend seit Menschengedenken den feurigen Atem genau in die Richtung von Peking—aber Peking selbst ist den Leuten im Dorf viel fremder als das jenseitige Leben. Sollte es wirklich ein Dorf geben, wo Haus an Haus steht, Felder bedeckend, weiter als der Blick von unserem Hügel reicht und zwischen diesen Häusern stünden bei Tag und bei Nacht Menschen Kopf an Kopf? Leichter als eine solche Stadt sich vorzustellen ist es uns, zu glauben, Peking und sein Kaiser wäre eines, etwa eine Wolke, ruhig unter der Sonne sich wandelnd im Laufe der Zeiten. If one wished to conclude from phenomena such as these that we have, in reality, no Emperor at all, then one would not be far from the truth. I must say it again and again: there is perhaps no people so loyal to the Emperor as we in the South, but the Emperor derives no benefit from our loyalty. Certainly the holy dragon stands on its little column at the exit to our village and blows, as it has since time immemorial, the homage of its fiery breath in the precise direction of Peking—but Peking itself is much more alien to the people in the village than even the hereafter would be. Could there really be such a thing as a village where house stands by house, covering the fields and stretching further than one can see from our hilltop, with people standing crammed together in the spaces in between? Rather than try to imagine such a city, it is easier for us to believe that Peking and its Emperor are one and the same thing, for instance: a cloud, calmly altering its contours beneath the sun, throughout the passage of the ages. Here, the order of the state derives its legitimacy from an ideological construct disguised as a natural phenomenon: the institution of the Emperor is thought of as a cloud. Roland Barthes has said that it is a trademark of ideologies that they seek to assume the quality of natural phenomena. 4 Kafka never did publish this text. He was dissatisfied with the metaphorical construct and tried various other ways of expressing the derivation of legitimacy before the text was finally abandoned in an incomplete state. We can see this if we look at the state of the variants. The transcription of the text above, beginning with line 7, is accompanied by an apparatus of its variants in the system used in our edition: 7 in die . . . Peking -] (1) in der Richtung in der Peking liegt, (2) in der Richtung [in der] &lt;von&gt; Peking [liegt,] 8 Dorf] Dorfe H 9 wo] [mit] wo H 9 steht,] steht, [weiter als der Bli A ] H 9 Felder bedeckend,] bedeckend Felder, H 10 stünden] [stehen] &lt;stünden&gt; H 11 Kopf?] Kopf (.&gt;?) 11 eine solche] [solche] [ei]ne 1 solche 12 vorzustellen,] vorstellen, H 12 uns,] (1) &lt;etwa&gt; (2) (etwa&gt;uns) 12 und sein Kaiser] &lt;und (der&gt;sein) Kaiser&gt; H 12-13 wäre . . . eine] (1) wäre eine (2) wäre&lt;n&gt; 2 &lt;nur&gt; eine (3) wären (nur&gt;eines) eine (4) wären eines &lt;,etwa&gt; eine 13-14 Wolke . . .

On the second manuscript page, this insertion and the subsequent ones were probably inscribed in the blank space below, under a separating rule across the page (4) Wolke, [ruhig sich wandelnd im Laufe der Zeiten wie Wolken am Sommerabend unter dem Strahl der mütterlichen Sonne.] Absatz &lt;die sich ruhig wandeln im Laufe der Zeiten unter dem Strahl der mütterlichen Sonne.&gt; (5) Wolke, die sich ruhig wandel(n&gt;t) im Laufe der Zeiten &lt;am Sommerabend&gt; 3 unter [dem Strahl] der mütterlichen Sonne. (6) Wolke, [die sich ruhig wandelt im Laufe der Zeiten am Sommerabend unter der mütterlichen Sonne.] &lt;ruhig unter der Sonne sich wandelnd im Laufe der Zeiten.&gt; separated by a rule across the page from the preceding draft sketches; a mark of insertion before ruhig links back to a corresponding mark on the previous manuscript page after Wolken Thus it is clear that Kafka experimented with various metaphors in order to render the process of making the Imperial Power legitimate. First he speaks in terms of a patriarchal system and uses "parental suns". In a second attempt the empire is legitimised in matriarchal terms and so we find "motherly suns". Finally he opts for the natural phenomenon, unembellished, and the imperial institution becomes a "cloud". This passage documents Kafka's attempt to express the nature of familial and social structures by means of a model based on feudalism and shows, as well, its failure: the retreat to a 'natural' model of legitimation. A passage like this reveals the essence of Kafka's 'construct' of middle-class individuality—and does so precisely by the unresolved tensions which are evident here, the vacillation between two different legitimising structures: culture , in the sense that it is an outgrowth of the family and develops into a genealogical ordering; nature , to the extent that it can be exploited to clothe an ideological construct. An example of how Kakfa's flow of creativity may dry up when he is inhibited by his own explanatory mode of writing is to be found in the Report for an Academy . A transcription dramatically emphasizes the nature of the text in the bottom half of the manuscript page; the lemmatisation of the last sentence demonstrates this complication: kommen. Es wird für die Akademie nichts wesentlich Neues beibringen und weit hinter dem zurückbleiben, was man von mir verlangt hat und was ich beim besten Willen nicht sagen kann—immerhin, es soll doch die Richtlinie zeigen, auf welcher ein gewesener Affe in die Menschenwelt eingedrungen ist und sich dort festgesetzt hat.

[Ergibt sich &lt;dann vielleicht&gt;, dass alle vom Tore des Paradieses ab diesen Weg eingeschlagen haben, einer früher einer später desto besser, desto [schlecht A ] schlimmer &lt;dann:&gt; und wir liegen uns alle in den Armen.] H I should now like to illustrate the problems that concern the relation of the manuscript to the published work. I have chosen examples from what are called the "Octavo Note Books" which contain some of the manuscripts later used for the volume A Country Doctor . In this context, there are four different points I must bring out. The "Report for an Academy" is particularly instructive. Kafka tried no less than four beginnings before he produced a version which seemed good enough for him to publish. The difficulties he had were essentially those of narrative perspective. How can an ape, who becomes human so as to survive in a human world, depict the process he has undergone? Let us consider the table on the next page. 5 Kafka's first attempt at the story takes the form of an interview with the impresario of the ape become human (I). The second beginning (II) is an interview with the ape himself. In the third (III) and fourth (IV) attempts the ape addresses a human academy. A fifth beginning (V) takes the form of a letter from the ape's teacher, who has lost his wits as a result of his pedagogical exertions. Only the third and fourth attempts satisfied Kafka as being suitable for publication. All the other perspectives on the story were ruled out, but they still belong to one and the same thematic complex and cannot be separated from it. There is, in addition, what I can only term a 'counter fantasy' concerning an "old man with wings", which is interpolated into the middle of the text ( a ). In it the ape become human is, as it were, confronted by a human being who has become an angel. What concerns me here as editor is the following: the Report for an Academy appears in two different contexts. On the one hand it is interwoven with various other fantasies in the "Octavo Note Books"; on the other it is embedded in the volume A Country Doctor . If the text is to be interpreted adequately, one must make both extended contexts tangible for the reader. Hence the critical Kafka edition will publish the text twice, once as it appears in the creative flow of the manuscript, then a second time within the framework of the collections which Kafka himself published. A further text from the "Octavo Note Books" provides a good demonstration of another problem. It is a text that breaks off during the process of composition, as it were, and which one would falsify as editor if one tried to turn it into a definitive text with the closed quality of a literary work. A feature of this text is that Kafka first planned it as a general observation, then tried to cast it as an autobiographical narrative, but gave up half-way through the process of transforming it. I shall first quote a version of Kafka's text, as it might present itself to the reader if an editor were to turn it into something looking like a finished 'work', and then append an English translation. Eine stinkende Hündin, reichliche Kindergebärerin, stellenweise schon faulend, die aber in meiner Kindheit mir alles war, die in Treue unaufhörlich mir folgt, die ich zu schlagen mich nicht überwinden kann und vor der ich ihren Athem scheuend schrittweise rückwärts weiche und die mich doch, wenn ich mich nicht anders entscheide in den schon sichtbaren Mauerwinkel drängen wird, um dort auf mir und mit mir gänzlich zu verwesen, bis zum Ende—ehrt es mich?—das Eiter- und Wurmfleisch ihrer Zunge an meiner Hand. A stinking bitch, that has had many litters, whose body is already rotting in places, but which meant everything to me as a child, which never ceases following me faithfully, that I can't bring myself to beat and before whose foul breath I retreat backwards step by step and which will nevertheless, if I don't change my mind about beating it, force me into that corner in the wall I can already see, so as to putrefy entirely upon me and with me there, and till the last moment—should I feel honoured?—the pussy, wormy flesh of its tongue on my hand. If we have access to the manuscript and can survey all the variants, then the following picture emerges: 1-2 Eine . . . die] (1) Die Welt ein stinkender Hund, stellenweise schon [verwesend] &lt;faulend&gt;, der (2) [Die Welt] (e&gt;E)in stinkend(er&gt;e) Hünd ( ,&gt;in ) , reichliche ( H&gt;K ) indergebärerin stellenweise schon faulend, d ( er&gt;ie ) 2-3 unaufhörlich . . . und] (1) unaufhörlich &lt;,&gt; [und vor dem i] den ich nicht [ ( [mi]&gt;Zuzu ) ] [Zu] schlagen darf (2) unaufhörlich &lt;mir folgt&gt;, den ich [nicht] &lt;zu&gt; schlagen [darf] &lt;mich nicht überwinden kann&gt; und (3) unaufhörlich mir folgt, d ( en&gt;ie ) ich zu schlagen mich nicht überwinden kann und 3 die] d ( er&gt;ie ) 4 vor . . . schrittweise] (1) vor dem ich schrittweise [nach] (2) vor dem ich &lt;jede seiner Berührungen scheuend&gt; schrittweise (3) vor de ( m&gt;r ) ich [jede] ( seiner&gt;ihre ) Berührungen &lt;ihren Athem&gt; scheuend schrittweise (4) vor der ich [ihre] Berührungen [ihren] &lt;ihre ( n&gt;s ) &gt; Athem scheuend schrittweise (5) vor der ich [Berührungen] ihres Athem scheuend schrittweise 4 rückwärts] [nach] rückwärts 4 die] d ( er&gt;ie ) 5 doch,] doch &lt;,&gt; 5-6 den . . .

He began: "The world [is] a stinking dog, already rotting in places . . ." Thus a judgement about the world was to be made in the form of a metaphorical comparison. In the course of working over the text, Kafka then turned it back into a kind of autobiographical reminiscence. Traces of this process are visible in the grammatical uncertainty that marks two places in the text. If an editor does as Max Brod did and removes these 'grammar mistakes', then he produces a text which the author never intended. We, on the contrary, are of the view that the unfinished quality of the text—by which we mean: the text as process—must be respected, and so the grammatical errors have to appear in the edited text to bring this aspect out clearly. A further problem that comes under the heading of the 'incomplete text' is demonstrated by Kafka's only attempt at drama, namely The Warden of the Crypt —Der Gruftwächter. 6 Kafka revised this long scene again and again and the method he used was to sketch a situation in one of the "Octavo Note Books", cross it out, copy it again with alterations, then cross it out again so as to produce, on a third or fourth attempt, further different versions. The following diagram shows the sequence of texts in the 'Octavo Note Books A to E' and in particular the six stages of composition of The Warden of the Crypt (1-6). Kafka's first editor, Max Brod, conflated these different versions and made of them a text that could be played on stage. He had, as it were, distilled a definitive text out of a series of re-writes by conflating them with one another. But this destroys the 'incompleteness of the text'. Therefore it is our task to present the successive versions in their entirety as a series and as a process—moreover in such a way that the crossings-out are signalled by the edited text, but the reader can still reconstruct all the changes in their proper order. A fourth set of problems centres around Kafka's struggle to evoke adequately what Emile Benveniste calls 'the authorities of discourse', "les instances du discours" in various texts. The text The New Advocate provides an eloquent demonstration of this. There are five different versions of this story, as shown in the diagram above. Kafka first (15) tries a first-person-singular narrative, then one in the third person (16), then one in the second (17). Finally he finds the solution of telling the story in the first person plural (18). If we were to suppress all the earlier attempts, we would be left with only the last, definitive text, which Kafka in fact had published. But it is equally important to document the fact that within the same textual ambience Kafka had three other tries at establishing the point of authority for his creative discourse. Now this is something the 'double edition' can do by printing the same text twice: once in the context of the "Octavo Note Books" where the various stages of composition are clearly revealed, and then a second time in the context of the collection published as A Country Doctor where Kafka himself ultimately placed it. Finally, we should be aware that Kafka also applied the principle of the 'unfinished text' to his own attitude towards publication. Let us look once more at the table which demonstrates what Kafka did when putting together the collection of stories published as A Country Doctor . (Cf. figure 1.) We must recall that Kafka first published many of his texts singly, then in small groups of texts, then in a larger collection and, finally, that a few of them were taken out of the collections again and republished singly. It is very interesting, for example, with regard to the stories in A Country Doctor , that Kafka had previously published thematically related stories separately in groups of two and three—also that he took a text out of the collection at the last moment, in fact from the page proofs, and then subsequently published it by itself in a newspaper. The text is Der Kübelreiter , meaning roughly The Rider on the Pail . What I think is significant is that Kafka tried in this manner to restore the originally fluid and unfixed quality which these texts had possessed in the manuscript stage through their inter-relation with their context and other texts, and to do so again and differently in the printed medium. I have shown that the printed collections have their own unique manner of construction, that they manifest changing perspectives in a play of fantasies of identity,—one which Kafka in the printed version arranged in a new order. But, in doing so, he applied the principle of the 'open text', so as to suggest the flow of creativity rather than that of the definitive, the closed 'work'. To sum up what I have tried to show in this discourse: whereas with many other writers the concept of the 'incomplete manuscript' is only relevant to their posthumous works, in Kafka's case it has to be applied to the whole of his literary achievement. Problems of the 'incomplete manuscript' or the 'open text' confront us not only when dealing with the manuscripts themselves, but they also affect the relation between manuscript and printed text and the separate issue of the structural composition of the printed collections. The dialectical interaction between the flow of creativity and the consolidation of texts into literary works is evident at every stage of Kafka's achievement, both in the intimacy of the autograph version and in the public manifestation of the printed work. His desire on the one hand, to shape closed works that are perfect in themselves, and his contrary desire: to keep the flow of creativity going, constantly interact with one another, and this interaction has its effects at every stage of his literary endeavour, right up to the ordering of texts in the collections he published. We find a similar situation with the work of the German writer Arno Schmidt. He too tried to preserve the open quality of his writing and the process of its composition by publishing his manuscripts with all their corrections in facsimile, thus making of them a 'work' and inscribing them as such in the world of letters. The work in question is called Zettels Traum , i.e. Bottom's Dream . In conclusion, it seems to me that the issues which are so conspicuous in Kafka's work are bound up with the complication of three fundamental concepts which all bear on what we have to understand by 'text' in the modern situation. These are firstly the concept of 'script' or 'writing'; secondly the concept of the 'work' and thirdly the concept of a 'fluid composite' which is never wholly the one nor the other. If one allows only one of these concepts to emerge into the foreground, then of necessity one falsifies the unique textual character of what Kafka produced. If we consider only the aspect of 'script' or 'writing', acknowledging only the flow of creativity, we would certainly reproduce the autograph versions, but we would have excluded the area of 'authorship' as an institution and the communicative function of literature as a social phenomenon. If we only consider the idea of the 'work', then we would do justice to the concept of 'authorship' and its emblem of authority the 'definitive version', the 'Ausgabe letzter Hand' as one says in German, but the questions of textuality and communication would remain unanswered. Finally, if we only look at the aesthetics of potential effect and concentrate purely on the intertextuality of the collections Kafka arranged as the 'fluid composite' of the various textual units, then we would have done nothing to shed light on the areas of manuscript and authorship. So one has little choice but to bring out all three aspects in an edition as the only way of doing justice to one specific understanding of textuality in the sphere of modern writing. Our edition employs various means to achieve this. To represent adequately the 'creative flow' of Kafka's manuscripts the whole of the "Octavo Note Books" are reproduced in a more or less 'diplomatic' version which remains faithful to the visual form of the original. These 'diplomatic' renderings will have on the facing page a facsimile of the manuscript. Then, through sheer fidelity to the principle of authorial approval, we shall print the texts Kafka himself published again in the volume Work Published in his Lifetime and thus do justice to the concept of the 'definitive version'. Then, finally, the edition will set out to demonstrate a third aspect, namely that of intertextuality, and by this I mean the interrelation of texts both in the manuscripts and in the collections. Such interrelations are extremely difficult to indicate typographically and so we must have recourse to commentary, using figures and tables such as I have shown here. This threefold technique should ensure that the edition conveys as complete an impression as possible of Kafka's 'open texts'. The success of this undertaking assumes, of course, that the same person must be both editor and interpreter. Editing is no longer a mechanical task of unquestioning reproduction, but rather the project of combining the skills of interpreting and philological reconstruction so as to do justice to modern concepts of author, work and text. These concepts became increasingly problematical in the course of the nineteenth century, as they developed out of the complications that beset the legendary 'unity of self' of the middle-class individual and today still reflect the problems of identity which are his chronic affliction.</field>

It proved necessary to combine two types of editorial technique: for large segments of text: a linear reproduction, a syntagmatic type of editing, as it were; but in those places where Kafka had made many corrections, we had to apply the principle of reproducing the text by stages, thus pursuing a more paradigmatic method. One might term this 'stereometric' in the sense that it is meant to reveal the stratification of the various levels of the text and thus reproduces the process of composing the text. Wherever these two modes of writing which, in turn, call for two different modes of editing, intersect, two typical kinds of correction appear in Kafka's text: on the one hand the first letter of a word never written out ('Buchstabenansatz': ( K A &gt; G ) eorg), and, on the other, letters and parts of words written over one another ('Überschreibung': ( Brief &gt; Blick ) ). In these two forms the interruption and the resumption of the flow of creativity are manifest. A model for the 'stereometric' representation of variants is offered for Hölderlin's poem Hälfte des Lebens in my essay (co-author Martin Ehrenzeller): "Rudolf Borchardt: Der unwürdige Liebhaber."

      <field name="fulltext">In interpreting the mind of another, the scholar also always interprets his own; and the history of ideas is shaped by ideas as much as by their interpretation. Do these familiar insights, essential for a theoretic foundation of the humanities, also apply to textual scholars? In their endeavour for accuracy in editions, they are said to be more concerned with the letter than the spirit. Normally their "higher criticism" is only conveyed indirectly through editorial technique and in formulaic conclusions. This proper mode of editorial reticence to explicate an understanding of an author and an oeuvre, of literature and literary genre, may easily give an impression that, witnessing to self-imposed pedantry, the editor's work is merely mechanical. But appearances are deceptive. The study of opposing positions in the history of classical and modern textual scholarship teaches a different lesson. The most distinctive standpoints within textual criticism express—amongst other things—the philologist's varying conception of the author, and of his own role as interpreter. This is not surprising. In his task to establish a version of the text which is as authentic as possible, the textual critic often finds himself faced with complex situations holding a multi-valent potential for decision. This gives rise to the question whether and to what extent the individual scholar's faculty of judgement—that is: his perception of the author applied to concrete source situations—may or should be involved in the acts of decision. Positions are divided on this matter between those who fundamentally assent to conjecture and emendation, and thereby indirectly to a realisation of their role as editors in terms of their image of the author; and those who, basically sceptical about textual interference, also consciously refrain from forming a particular image of the author, valuing instead an openness of approach to the author as to their own work. The question which of these attitudes is the correct one can never be answered conclusively. But exploring their grounds can secure a vital interest for the history of textual criticism, provided that this is seen as itself part of a history of ideas and not merely as a record of sample cases to guide editorial decisions. In the field of classical philology, Rudolf Pfeiffer has made a contribution to this manner of historical approach in his History of Classical Scholarship . 1 In the modern languages, where textual scholarship must generally deal with more complex transmissional situations, often incorporating, too, a genetic dimension, there have as yet been only isolated attempts of a similar kind. 2 Along with textual criticism, there are two other areas of responsibility within editorial philology in which it is impossible to work profitably without a conception of the implications of the philological task in question. Firstly: the arrangement of texts and choice of versions; secondly: the evaluation and the presentation of an author's work process. Here, too, the editor confronts the question of his attitude to the author and to himself. The less he commits himself, and thus the more he keeps aloof from forming a consistent understanding of the author and of himself, the closer he may in fact come to the oeuvre and the work process as such —the author's as well as the editor's. The following is an attempt to investigate the ways editors see their role, by analysing their conceptualisations of authorial writing. Instead of the usual pragmatic approach to editors' interpretations (are their text-genetical presentations in keeping with the evidence from extant sources? are they readable and illustrative?) we shall be concerned with the editor's work in the context of a history of ideas. The editorial enterprise is not seen instrumentally, as a means to an end, but as a form of expression meaningful in itself. The authorial work processes, in their turn, will be considered from the same angle, with a view to finding new keys to understanding them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The critical edition—two contrasting concepts In 1899 Wilhelm Dilthey gave a programmatic lecture under the heading "Archives for Literature." It was largely thanks to this lecture that manuscript bequests of poets and writers were approved as archive material and ultimately taken into state care. 3 Dilthey, Schleiermacher's biographer, regarded original manuscripts as an invaluable key to an understanding of their authors. He wanted to see them collected and researched in literary archives. He felt a "human breath" emanating from "drafts, letters, notes" 4 and considered it the joint aim of the appreciative reader and the researching literary historian to comprehend them. "What would we give today to be able to read into the souls of Aeschylus or Plato, through such simple and direct statements" (p. 5). An author's manuscript remains could, as it were, fill in the blank spaces in an author's involuntary self-interpretation of his life philosophy, only partially rendered if "isolated and coolly presented in print" (p. 5). Yet however highly Dilthey assessed the cognitive value of literary manuscripts, for him they were not intrinsically significant—for instance, as witnesses to unknown versions of the text—but indirectly as a part of an entire body of evidence, from which the author's understanding of the world might be deduced. Manuscript archives, accordingly, were not viewed as a preparatory facility for editorial work; on the contrary, such collections would "considerably reduce" the need for printed publication (p. 16). The central historical interest here is not in the work and its genesis, but in the author and his interpreter. It is ultimately the latter's concern—as reader and researcher—to comprehend the existing work of the author; to express this in terms of experience: "to acquaint himself better with his own self." 5 The author is thus possibly better understood by his interpreter than he understood himself, because he was not conscious of his own creative activity. 6 If it be the common goal of authors and interpreters to develop a durable and representative understanding of humanity on the basis of a shared experience of the fundamental conflict between an individual and a social identity, interpretive empathy, according to Dilthey, weighs decidedly on the social side of the scale. With regard to the affirming of one's own intrinsic existence, moreover, the positions of the artist and the interpreter are exchangeable. Dilthey hence always stressed the "homogeneity of intellectual life" ("Beiträge", p. 251). In his theory of the humanities, creative and interpretive activity correspond structurally, receptive contemplation taking precedence over action in both cases. This receptive contemplation is based in an unforced openness and receptivity for external and internal perceptions (e.g., memories)—a view formalised, for example, in Dilthey's much-quoted circular definition of experience—expression—comprehension. Since Dilthey sees the process by which literary expression is shaped as largely unconscious, he grants it little importance compared to actual experience. It is not the ability of expression, but merely the degree of that ability which distinguishes the author from the interpreter. Similarly, it is only the intensity of the powers of mind and intellect by which they differ. The decisive factor here is that literary production is viewed from the perspective of the recipient, who wishes to open or entrust himself to the author. This attitude, profoundly influenced by Goethe and the spirit of his age, has had a sustained effect in German literary studies. It is also evident in the development of the modern Germanist edition—as illustrated by the Weimar Goethe edition and the Stuttgart Hölderlin edition (see below: The reception-oriented editorial concept ). A wholly opposite attitude to the process of literary production underlies the so-called "critique génétique" which has arisen in France since the 1970s and concerns itself with the textual genesis of literary works as evidenced in the original manuscripts. 7 It has developed out of French structuralist literary theory, with which it shares a methodical objectivism concentrated on exploring the text in its spatial/temporal dimensions. What distinguishes it from structuralism is a broadening of the field of observation and vision: behind the text as a closed and semeiological object, its perspective takes in the actual production of the text ("textualisation", "avant-texte", "le texte n'existe pas"); behind the written form ("l'écrit") it views the actual writing ("l'écriture"), behind the printed work the original manuscript. 8 This extension of the critical object to include the original handwritten documents is not only quantitative; it also affects the reader's or interpreter's attitude to the works, now enriched by a "third dimension", 9 to their authors, and of necessity thus ultimately to himself. Exploring a work's textual genesis involves reconstructing the text chronologically and in a multitude of successive states and versions, each discrete and of only relative validity. The reader is thereby presented with a complexity of relations by which to read the text—he may select and combine them at will, exploring a textually structured field according to his combinatory and imaginative powers. "L'organisation du texte sur la feuille, les marginales, ajouts, renvois, less textes croisés [. . .] dedoublent les systemes de significations et multiplient par là les réseaux de lecture." 10 "Critique génétique" objectifies by philological means the tenet of reception aesthetics that in the act of reading the reader imaginatively shapes his own texts. 11 The intellectual appeal of this "approche génétique" to literary works is probably based upon the fact that, perhaps more than any other methodology in modern literary studies, it satisfies the need for subjective self-realisation in constructive activity, providing, as it does, a field for developing analytical techniques, serviceable terminologies or distinct methods of interpretation. 12 It is hence characterized by a tendency towards specialisation and critical self-sufficiency, a kind of "critique génétique pour la critique génétique". Indicative of this tendency is its abstract image of the author, removed into a sort of "instance écrivante". 13 "La notion même d'écrivain se dissout dans l'incertitude" 14 —to such an extent that the concept appears applicable no longer just to single individuals, but also to collectives. 15 This view of the author as the subject of constructive writing operations limited only by the instrumental conditions of his productivity reflects the interpreter's understanding of his own self. It is a view not derived from an objectified image of man serving an inter-subjective exploration of the self as a community being, but from self-determined work in which the decisive affirmation of the individual is embodied symbolically. The extent and intensity of interest in the processes of production as such and their self-determining quality—for authors as well as for readers—is indicative of the strength of a will to self-realisation in the individual striving for liberation from pre-formed social models. From the point of view of intellectual history, it appears particularly significant that there is a common ground between modern critics and modern writers on this point. "On a déjà beaucoup parlé de cette conjonction entre une littérature qui traite de sa propre pratique et une critique qui explore les mécanismes du travail littéraire." 16 Both sides agree that a more suitable route to self-development can be found in productivity than in receptivity. The fact that "critique génétique" hitherto has been concerned mainly with the autographs of those authors who are regarded as the forerunners of modernism: Flaubert, Heine, Proust, Valéry, Zola, 17 also demonstrates this affinity. In the German-speaking world there is, as yet, no line of scholarship comparable to "critique génétique." The Germanist literary scholars bent on systematically exploring the text genetics of literary manuscripts are predominantly editors. Their investigations are hence for the greater part guided by pragmatic interests. The perspectives that "critique génétique" develops independently of practical editing can be found within the German-speaking world in critical editions and in related works of editorial theory. Their main characteristics will be clarified with reference to the Goethe Academy edition and the Frankfurt Hölderlin edition (see below: The production-oriented editorial concept ). The decisive criterion by which to contrast the reception-oriented and the production-oriented editorial concepts lies in the difference of the image that in each the editor coins of the author. In the case of the reception-oriented concept, the author is understood as a person who, in his literary expression, establishes an inter-subjectively recognised identity. Here the author is mainly attributed with a characteristically deliberate, even teleological, attitude towards himself, and hence towards what he and others approve as constituent of a personal self. In respect of such identity, the author and the editor occupy reciprocally exchangeable positions: each is a literary producer and each is also the discerning recipient of such production. Each sees himself as a self (1st person) from the perspective of another self (2nd person) and knows himself as the other (2nd person) for the other. In the production-oriented concept, by contrast, the image of the author is modelled to the assumption that his artistic intent is directed primarily towards his creative work and not towards his own self, which is in principle veiled in obscurity. In respect of this tendency towards an indeterminacy of the personal self, too, the positions of author and editor are reciprocally exchangeable; each relates to himself and to others as a subject (1st person) to the object (3rd person). The relationship of the editor and the author to each other is that of observer and observed creator of self-determined work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The reception-oriented editorial concept Regarding themselves as middlemen between the authors and the reading public, nineteenth-century critical editors exercised a remarkable reticence; they spoke little of their own activity. This is true of Karl Lachmann and Franz Muncker in the edition of Lessing's Complete Works ; of Muncker in the "critical-historical" edition of Klopstock's Odes ; and, above all, of the editors of the Weimar Goethe edition. Precedence of text presentation over the critical apparatus The Preface to this critical Goethe edition in 143 volumes extends to only seven pages, and the information about the numerous manuscripts and prints of the poems in the first volume occupies a mere six pages. The apparatus of variant readings is also maximally concise, being meant as no more than a "critical appendix". 18 The presentation of the texts as the author intended them finally to be given to the public was considered of greater importance than the description of manuscripts and prints or the details of variants and versions. The editors' reticence reflects their decision on what matter they considered more or less worth communicating to the reader. If one recognises two different editorial aims, each attainable on the basis of authentic and authorial records as preserved for modern authors: firstly, to reconstruct the shaping and reshaping process of literary works, and secondly, to define the particular form of a work with which the author wished in the final instance to be publicly identified, it is clear that the editors of the Weimar edition unambiguously gave precedence to the second. The processes of composing and revising a work were merely of historical antiquarian interest to them. 19 Generally cognisant of Goethe's attitude to his literary output as embodied in the last edition of his works which he himself supervised (the so-called "Ausgabe letzter Hand" 20 ), they considered it their moral duty to respect his final intentions almost unconditionally. The serious lack of information within the apparatus, crucially insufficient details about the manuscripts and the selective and isolative rendering of the variant readings 21 have been explained as due to the fact that the "editors of the Lachmann school" 22 were still bound to the model of editorial technique in classical philology. There may be some truth in this, even though, if so, the method has not become outwardly effective—the apparatus, for instance, is not arranged in the form of footnotes. However, the explanation casts underserved aspersions on the pioneers of editing in modern German philology, making them appear as indiscriminate imitators. What brings them close to their colleagues in classical philology is a formal matter: the merely selective consideration of witnesses not chosen as editorial base texts. Yet the reasons for such selectivity differ. In the case of classical philology, the selection serves to justify the critically constituted text and is hence determined by its purpose. In modern editing, by contrast, the author's authentic or authorised text did not require any justification, and the selection of the variants was thus not linked to any objective aim, but was subjectively motivated. This explains the methodological aimlessness of the apparatus in the Weimar Goethe edition. It is determined by "the most respectful consideration for the wider circle of educated readers." 23 "Negligences or mere spelling errors" in the manuscripts are excluded as an unnecessary encumbrance; it is only variation which "is heard in the spoken language and which affects the syllable count and hence, in verse, the metre" that is considered worthy of record. 24 This guiding rule, it is true, is not observed consistently. 25 The apparatus of the Weimar edition has been called a "dead apparatus" 26 by one of its fiercest critics. With regard to individual volumes this is certainly an unfair criticism, but as an overall appraisal it does characterise the curiously functionless nature of the apparatus. The editors can hardly have remained unaware of the obvious difference between transmissional variants (the concern of classical philologists) and the genetic variants integral to the author's own manuscripts. 27 Yet they clearly were at a loss how to deal with these, 28 because they saw themselves primarily neither as textual critics nor as documentary historians, but as readers . This understanding of their role corresponds to their model of the author. The model of the author in the 2nd person—the self-realising author Editorial opinion in the early period of German philology held it to be the author's essential characteristic to be able to communicate his own self through his text, and not to draft and compose a text. According to such understanding, the author is a subject oriented towards listeners and readers (including critics), and observing and assessing himself creatively from their perspective, i.e., in the 2nd person. The editor, in his role as reader and through his endeavour for supra-individual self-determination, represents as it were the other self, the author's partner, and vice versa. The reading stance common to both is evaluative, positively or negatively. The editor's understanding, then, of his own role is modelled on his assumptions about the author. If he views the author first and foremost as a judicious reader of his works, he does not in principle desire to be anything else. He considers everything that links author and reader to be more important than what separates them. If, on the other hand, he sees the author primarily as the producer of his texts, he conceives the editorial task ultimately only in terms of their reproduction from a common ground of subjective creativity. In either case, the mode in which the author is viewed is irreducibly voluntative and at best only approximately suited to given conditions of writing and transmission. If the editor favours the model of the author in the 2nd person, it implicitly follows that he wishes the author to determine in which version and in which order his texts should be edited. In other words: he does not wish to give room to editorial judgement or discretion in these matters. The editor thus sees himself akin to an advocate, an executor of the author's will, before the forum of his readers. This is an attitude obviously determined by ethical principles, since it implies that the writer is taken absolutely seriously as a person and that his intention is respected as the highest editorial principle. The consequences of this kind of editorial ethos as they emerge in relation to the creative and revisional work of the author are: a limited interest in textual criticism and source description on the part of the editor, and a modal misinterpretation of the author's work. The author's intention The author's intention, as is well known, is a fundamental concept much debated in editorial theory. 29 By and large it seems that, despite the problems involved, it cannot be relinquished without negative consequences for critical editing. If it were renounced, if editors were to declare the very concept of authorial intention on principle to be outside their province, discernible expression of such intention would be entirely subject to editorial discretion, if not indeed arbitrariness. 30 Too little consideration however has usually been given to the fact that the notion of authorial intention can be applied in two different ways: as intentio recta (author in the 2nd person) and as intentio obliqua (author in the 3rd person). It is the second way which is relevant to textual criticism. The question here is, whether a text or textual part or particle as transmitted is, or may be considered, intended (meant) by the author. Editorially, the predicate "intended" may on principle be attributed to a specific textual finding or its emendation only when modified as "possibly intended". 31 Yet the "possibility" is subject to many degrees of certainty and probability or uncertainty and improbability, in much the same way as what a third party intends (or means) can only be known on the basis of everyday suppositions. The editor assumes responsibility for adjudicating intention in a manner different from that for his making descriptive statements which can be verified or falsified from the extant textual materials. Whereas the reasoning behind descriptive statements can be completely objectified, if need be with the help of explicit conceptual definitions and rules of procedure, this is not the case with assertions of textual criticism concerning the degree to which a transmitted text can be intended (meant). These are always only partly objectifiable, and the editor can only vouch for them on the basis of an understanding and knowledge which he has gained in his role as reader, interpreter and textual critic. Hence they always hold good only in relation to the editor's familiarity with the author's voluntative and linguistic behaviour. 32 Whereas editorial theory has hitherto been dominated by the reciprocal editor/author relationship in the 1st and 2nd person—the reception-oriented editorial concept—or the one-directional editor/author relationship in the 1st and 3rd person—the production-oriented concept—the implications of the notion of authorial intention may be clarified from a perspective in which the author occupies the 2nd and 3rd person. The author's literary activity displays two sides: on the one hand it fulfills a specific purpose, the production of texts, and on the other hand it is a form of expression, a way of articulating the self in the text. The concept of authorial intention may be differentiated accordingly. The author's intention to produce and communicate a text: what is meant and what is intended Writing, as it transposes conceptualised linguistic utterances into the spatial-visual dimension, is basically an artificial application of the imagination. It necessarily has repercussions on the creative expression, since it renders transitory conceptions permanent. However, the representational mode of linguistic utterances is not altered in their inscription. Hence, writing is not to be equated with acts of direct communication in oral speech that cannot be revoked. This fundamental distinction is not infrequently overlooked, 33 which leads to a modal misinterpretation of texts in autograph. Writing is without doubt an intentional act. Yet is the result of this act, the written text, intended by the author? The answer to this question is open where the author's attitude as reader to the text is indeterminable. Such is in principle the case with all texts he has not (or not yet) published. All that can be said about them is that the author intended them as possible results of his writing, or even that he potentially intended them as definitive and no longer disposable compositions. In respect to such texts, it is more profitable to rephrase the question and ask whether they, as they appear in written form , were meant, or could have been meant, by the author. Whenever one is involved in transposing conceptions into words or into writing, that is, when his own thoughts, and not those of his listeners or readers, are the central focus, it is relevant to ask what is actually meant by what is spoken or written or whether what is spoken or written actually represents what is meant (particularly in the case of an unusually or wrongly spelt word or one that does not seem to fit the context). What is meant is primarily that which is objectively intended. It represents the author's transitory textual resolution which could be explained further as that which he possibly wished to convey or present for reading by what he said or wrote. The textual critic's scope for decision ends at the point where he cannot question what is meant by the author—for instance in the case of two separate autograph versions of a text. Here it is not within his arbitration, in his role as textual critic, which of the two should be reproduced. If the author has actually communicated one version, that is, released the contents and textual composition from his control and submitted it to another's (e.g., a publisher's, who has it printed and distributed), it is true to say that this version is intended by the author. But as what? Not as a text produced, but as a text received, also by others. The communication of a specific text version implies that the author, in his role as a reader, has positively assessed it, with a regard, too, to other readers. This means he has read and approved the text in the interest of other readers, 34 and in doing so he has asked himself whether his inner perception of man and the world (the yardstick of his identity and linguistic mode of utterance) is adequately reflected in it. Is the editor obliged to respect the author's intention to objectify his ideal self? Unlike the author's textual intention (i.e., what is meant), this represents, as it were, a higher degree of intention and is often singled out as the "real", "ultimate" or "final" intention. If this intention can be positively identified, then the editor is indeed obliged to respect it. It concerns, after all, that striving for self-determination and, eminently, for personal identity, to the expression of which literature above all lends itself. However, the editor's respect for the author's identity as objectified in the literary mode does not relieve him of his duty to explore the genesis of the text and exercise his judgment as textual critic on the documents of transmission. It does not allow him to assume the attitude of a merely corrective reader. The editors of the Weimar Goethe edition were of a different opinion. Choosing the "Ausgabe letzter Hand" as their basis, they believed the poet had taken the greatest care and had been conscientiously exact in producing a correct and final revised edition (WA I, 1, p. xix). Erroneously they presumed that Goethe's intention to have his works seen into print accurately with the help of an able philologist 35 had actually had a result corresponding to the intention. They did not recognise that the versions of the text printed in that edition, precisely because they had been painstakingly prepared verbatim et literatim , should editorially have been minutely re-examined to see whether, on that microphilological level, they were as intended by the poet. For it is true that, being the result of a work process, every state of a text, in manuscript or in print, only represents the intended state as a whole , and not in every detail . A text in toto (which means also: a text read) such as that of Goethe's final edition of his works is undoubtedly to be considered authorised by the author; yet this does not apply in partibus (meaning also: to the text as produced)—and especially not to passages where what the author meant can so easily be shown to have been subject to unintentional changes by himself or by his helpers. 36 The crucial question of textual criticism, namely whether a printed text is also the intended one, cannot be ignored a priori or narrowly interpreted with regard either to the accidentals of spelling and punctuation or to individual words. It is independent of the degree of authorisation in the preparatory phases of reproduction. The editors of the Weimar edition exercised textual criticism with extreme reticence. They believed that they were basically entitled only to correct the final edition of Goethe's works, to eliminate obvious errors, but not to submit it to recension. 37 Valuing above all the edition's authenticity, they essentially did not regard it as the result of a work process, but as "the unmediated intimation of the author himself". 38 The editors' decision in favour of the final edition as the basis for their rendering of the text has its fundamental reason neither in textual criticism nor in historical research. The decisive factor for the Weimar editors was the author's self-determining will at the peak of his maturity, i.e., at the stage when his self-reflection in the mirror of his entire literary oeuvre was most consciously developed and his self-distancing ability with a regard for its readers was at its highest. Goethe's final edition represents the "pinnacle" of all his editions in his lifetime 39 in so far as it attests his attitude towards the greater part of his literary oeuvre. It was obviously a complete matter of course for the Weimar editors to choose the poet's final edition and no other as the basis of their own. 40 This indicates that they were always more inclined towards a representation of the receptive-reflective Goethe than to Goethe as a literary producer. Their perception was of the poet who, conscious of his readers, affirmed or rejected what he had written, and not of the author who in writing would to a lesser degree have reflected the reader's perspective. Only from such partisanship could the poet's final edition have been accorded unquestioned canonicity. It is therefore no coincidence that evidence of the writer's work meant little to the editors of the Weimar Goethe edition, as shown in the critical apparatus. Likewise, it is no accident that they misinterpreted such evidence as the involuntary expression of Goethe's mind and intellect, as indicated in their qualifying the final edition of the works as "the unmediated intimation of the author himself". 41 Disregard of the author's work due to modal misinterpretation The great Stuttgart Hölderlin edition is held by German philologists to be exemplary of literary editions avoiding the information deficiency in the critical apparatus for which the Weimar Goethe edition is typical. The textual editor, Friedrich Beissner, records the manuscript variants in their entirety, including even the alterations irrelevant to the actual wording of the text; and he presents them readably. Without doubt, the critical apparatus is thereby significantly enhanced, even though it remains subordinated to the presentation of the text. As before, it is the writer's final and binding word that goes to constitute the edition text. The axiom of the reception-oriented editorial concept to honour " the poet's intention and his right to his work " 42 remains valid. In other words: the author is still granted the decision how his works are to be read. It is however debatable if this is possible in Hölderlin's case to the same extent as it appeared to be in Goethe's. For Hölderlin there exists neither a final revised edition nor "prints of individual works whose wording, since checked by the poet himself, should be binding for the editor". 43 Hölderlin's oeuvre has come to us largely as a legacy of unpublished manuscripts. 44 The editor's determination to let the author decide how his works should be read was therefore to be realised only by means of a text-genetical interpretation of the manuscripts, although these often enough are in the nature of heavily worked-over drafts. Beissner's mode of text-genetical interpretation becomes fully apparent in his method and system of variant presentation. Its essential characteristic is to situate the variants within the context of a reconstruction of the text's chronological development. The main focus is not on individual alterations, but on the representation of successive genetic versions. On the assumption that the author has replaced the earlier version by the later one, the later version is regarded as the one finally intended by him. If one accepts this system of text-genetic interpretation, Hölderlin's ultimate versions may indeed be constructed by stages from the heavily worked-over drafts. Yet is the implicit premise legitimate? Beissner stressed repeatedly that his main concern was to develop from the "spatial confusion" of the manuscripts and their corrections a "chronological order of sequence" of genetic versions of the text. In this way he held that the genetic process could be rendered both presentable and comprehensible as a process. 45 The implicit consequences may be clarified by reflecting that the spatial dimension of an inscription, if irrelevant, can be considered so only from the reader's perspective but not from that of the writer. For the author, the spatiality of the writing importantly conditions his creative linguistic behaviour, enabling him constructively to negotiate his conceptions and their expression. 46 It is with the help of the spatial dimension that he renders his conceptualisations visible and available. He is in control of everything he has recorded in writing—which in turn may influence his imagination—as long as he is able to decide whether it should be retained or not. He can decide for as long as what he has written remains readable and decipherable to him. Deleted or otherwise invalidated passages must generally be taken to be included in such writing. Textual exclusions of this kind should therefore not be taken as definitive, i.e. , as outright annulments, but as provisional deletions. Invalidated wordings within a manuscript must be considered potentially valid if still legible to the author. Conversely, all wordings left valid should be considered potentially invalid . In his genetic representation of the manuscript texts Beissner sacrifices their spatial dimension. The alinear spatiality of draft initiations and alterations is turned into a linear temporality of text stages where each stage is definitively replaced by the next. This conversion is not a matter of mere externals. Rather, it reflects an assessment of the authenticity of the states of an unpublished text in autographs. The editor turns into definitive text what for the author in principle was only potential writing. Hence, the editor's system of genetic interpretation reinterprets the modality of the writing: from being author-related it becomes reader-related. Otherwise the editor's aim to make possible an "actively participating and co-productive view of the work in progress" 47 would indeed remain incomprehensible. It is in a manner the editor who produces genetic readings from the poet's draft fluidities. In so doing, he not only disregards the spatial dimension as something seemingly unimportant. He also neglects the specific productive (constructive) function which writing has for the author as a process of visually recording transitory reflections that acts as a reinforcement of his imagination. He degrades, in effect, the act of writing to a mere external reproductive activity of no importance for its written result, which is paradoxical especially for an author whose manuscripts show that he made superbly constructive use of their spatial dimension in drafting his texts. 48 Favouring the reader's perspective, this edition abandons the fundamental difference between the author's and the reader's evaluation of writing. For the reader, the act of writing as such is unimportant; important is only its outcome in what the writing imparts. Taking writing to be merely a graphic medium of communication, and categorically equating the written and the oral utterance, the reader views the act of writing as a graphic realisation of inner speech. This receptive stance is by extension attributed to the author when it is implicitly assumed that his characteristic and essential activity is to affirm or reject his writing in the reading of it as an articulation of inward perceptions whose content core remains unalterable. In the Stuttgart edition, Hölderlin—like Goethe in the Weimar edition—is primarily understood as an author who positively or negatively evaluates his writing as an immediate projection of his imagined self. The manuscript deletions and changes are not considered in their merely potential quality holding no prejudice for the author's final decision on a given text in publication; they are considered definitive. A deleted or unaltered result of changes is not seen as the last of several textual options, but as the "only possible form" or the "consummate form" of expression. 49 The editor seems to have been aware that this reader-oriented system of interpretation is incommensurate with the nature of authentic textual production, since he justifies his text-genetical representation as setting out the "ideal growth" of the text and not its actual development, which "cannot generally be deduced from manuscripts". 50 This is an acceptable argument under the premise that it is relatively unimportant to know how the author worked, and more important that "organic links" should not be severed. 51 However, the "organic link" between states of textual development is finally seen to be the articulate author reaching out for the perfect expression of his self. 52 The disregard and modal misinterpretation of the writer's work evident in the Weimar edition is thus by no means overcome in the Hölderlin edition, even though its textual editor understood much better how to deal with the manuscripts than did his colleagues of the Goethe edition (Beissner, "Editionsmethoden", p. 73). To summarise: the reception-oriented editorial concept does not promote an interest in an improved understanding of literary work processes. Hence it develops no analytic system, differentiating terminology or representationally adequate model for dealing with text changes in autographs. 53 Philologists who favour this concept are more intent on preparing poet editions for the general reader than work editions for the scholarly user. 54 As far as possible, they eschew specialised editorial professionalism. 55 As long as there are authors who sufficiently clearly lay down their decisions on the versions in which they wish their texts to be read, and as long as there are readers willing to submit their souls to authorial guidance, this editorial concept cannot be considered outdated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The production-oriented editorial concept Whereas Goethe's works were edited in the Weimar edition according to the reception-oriented concept, the first critical edition of Schiller's Complete Works of 1867-1876 provides an early example of the production-oriented editorial concept. 56 Some of its fundamental principles have been applied or at least adumbrated in this critical edition which is more concerned with a "history of Schiller's mind" ( Schiller , 1, p. v) than with the Schiller who, within limits, determined the way in which his work should be read in the individual publications he instigated. (In a short life, it was not given to him to publish his collected works.) For his editors, Schiller's identity as he wanted it to be understood through his works was less important than what he produced in writing during his lifetime. Karl Goedeke, the editor, declared it his primary desire to document Schiller's creative mind in its individual artistic outpourings as set forth both diachronically and synchronically in their order of conception. It was his aim "faithfully to reproduce of each greater or smaller composition the earliest existing form, be it from a manuscript or printed source" ( Schiller , 15, 1, p. v). Not the final authorised version but the earliest available one provided his base text. Moreover, since the aspect of authorial production took precedence over that of communicative self-determination, it was logical that the process of composition and revision should be reproduced as comprehensively and accurately as possible. 57 The record of Schiller's textual alterations (which, in fact, is not complete) shows the endeavour to present them not just as the results of alterations, i.e. , deviations from the edited base text, but as acts of alteration with indications of how the changes were effected. This represents an important step in raising the status of the literary work process, the writer's crafting shop as opposed to his self-sufficient 'thought workshop'. 58 How fundamental a step this was may be concluded from the editor's explicitly formulated insight that it carried consequences beyond the typographical conventions of text reproduction as designed for the readers. "Only photographic reproduction could give an idea of what the writer considered worthy of notation in the course of his work. Only photography, too, could clarify his manner of composition, which deleted letters and font variations do not suffice to illustrate. Yet it seemed an essential task to approximate the creative process as far as this may be visualised through the medium of print." This statement appears in the preface to the last volume of Goedeke's Schiller edition published in 1876 (15, 2, p. vi). Almost a century later, in 1975, the first volume of the Frankfurt Hölderlin edition drew the conclusion for editorial technique from such insight: facsimiles of Hölderlin's manuscripts complementing diplomatic transcriptions of their textual layout and a representation of the textual genesis became an integral part of the critical edition. 59 For a long time the significance of the Schiller edition was not duly appreciated. It never became a model for methodology 60 and barely affected twentieth-century philologists who developed the production-oriented editorial concept. 61 Its most apparent innovation is a reconceived critical apparatus, yet this could not be developed from Goedeke's edition in which the apparatus was outwardly arranged according to the pattern of the apparatus criticus in classical philology. In modern editorial theory and practice the emphasis shifts from the reproduction of the text to the critical apparatus. Equivalence or precedence of the apparatus over the text If the editor sets the chronicler's approach above the reader's perspective, the author's published and unpublished work, the final and the earlier text versions, will rank equal with him. Goedeke was still undecided on this matter. Only Schiller's "youthful attempts" did he qualify wholly as "instances of his development and evidence of the history of Schiller's mind" ( Schiller , 1, p. v). It was not in editorial Schiller scholarship but, remarkably, in a new critical edition of Goethe's works, the so-called Academy edition, 62 that this historical perspective came to be applied most decisively. This is particularly remarkable since for Goethe's works authorised publications exist in great numbers, a situation without parallel for Schiller or indeed any other author in modern German literature. It is a transmissional situation that does not exactly invite a levelling of ranks among the witnesses to the evolution of the oeuvre and its individual parts. The reasons for nevertheless adopting and consistently upholding the historical perspective are mainly conceptual. The Academy edition, in truth, was designed to replace the section of the "literary works" in the Weimar edition. 63 It not only reflects an improved knowledge of the materials and a sharpened awareness of the problematics of textual criticism, it was also intended to convey a different perception of Goethe. 64 The "historical relief of Goethe's poetry, its outer metamorphosis which cannot be separated from its inner metamorphosis" was to be set against the "ahistorical nature" of the Weimar edition. 65 Ernst Grumach, the first editor-in-chief of the Academy edition, took his guidance no longer from the author's final communicated intention but rather from his original one: "It is only the author's original intention—as far as this can be deduced from the manuscripts and the first editions authorised by him—which can reliably inform the constitution of the text" ("Probleme", p. 45). In addition to its critical function of recording and justifying the constitution of the text, the critical apparatus was entrusted with the historical task of "relating a textual history" ( ibid. , p. 47) ranging from preparatory notes to the final version of the revised text. Under Grumach's direction, the "historical relief" of Goethe's oeuvre was to retain its peaks and elevations in the shape of the critically constituted "best" texts in versions "adequately expressing the author's intention". 66 This constitution of the text was of course not to be achieved in the divinatory spirit of a Richard Bentley, but in the historical manner of a Karl Lachmann, taking into consideration "all extant textual witnesses and all factors which influenced the textual history" ( ibid. , p. 6). For this reason Grumach termed the Academy edition a "critical-historical" edition of Goethe's works. 67 The "historical relief" was levelled out by his successors, and the critical-historical edition became an "historical-critical" one. 68 They abandoned the aim of establishing a "best" text. The critical constitution of the text through recension lost considerable importance in favour of a greater respect for the preserved historical form of the text. Corruptions were to be determined only within the context of the base text and were, if possible, to be emended only in relation to a knowledge of that text. The process of recension was to be carried out on the basis of internal evidence only, without recourse to text-genetic knowledge about the author's habitual usages in the language and in his writing. 69 Consequently corruption was adjudicated within the limits of more or less obvious error. This limitation in applying procedures of textual criticism resembles the considered restrictive practices of the Weimar Goethe edition: les extrêmes se touchent . A reserve towards textual criticism is common to editors who see themselves primarily as the author's loyal trustees and those who see themselves preeminently as documentary historians of his work. Grumach's successors indeed only pursued the path he took to its logical end. In defining "the poet's original intention" as mainly binding for the reproduction of the text, Grumach implicitly adopted a critical stance that considered Goethe's creative behaviour as his essential characteristic. The authorised first edition, or indeed the manuscript behind it, seemed closest to the author's immediate production. "That which no longer appertains to the process of poetic composition and revision, the predominantly corrective, intended or unintended alterations in the later printings and editions" was relegated to the critical apparatus. 70 With such partisanship for Goethe in his capacity as producer of texts, the differentiating potential inherent in terms such as "composition" and "revision" was apt to wane. To Grumach's successors, composition and revision, conceptual and revisional work, creative and corrective shaping were all indistinguishably aspects of a textual development resulting equivalently in text or text versions. 71 This in turn made the choice of the first authorised printing or its manuscript source as the base text for the edition questionable as such. It could only be maintained on extraneous grounds, such as an allegiance to the established practice of the Academy edition itself or to that of other editions. 72 At the same time, the basis dwindled for a more demanding type of textual criticism that would take the author's recognisable habits as a guideline, when possible, for the constitution of the text in the case of oversights or transmissional corruption. On the one hand, an attitude equating the author's published texts with the unpublished ones would imply seeing even the published ones essentially as the results of his creative work. Yet if, on the other hand, the published texts and versions are regarded as in essence not intended by the author, the textual critic is deprived of a reliable basis for his judgement. Should he, as editor, follow the linguistic and orthographic usage in the authorised prints, or should he adopt usages deduced from the manuscripts—even though these may vary to an extraordinary degree? The restrictive attitude towards exercising textual criticism evident in the volumes of the Academy edition since 1963 is essentially the editors' own choice. This needs to be emphasised, since there exist also restrictions to textual criticism grounded in objective criteria, e.g., in the case of authors who largely did not publish their work, 73 or in the case of authors characteristically undecided about which of their texts should be published, and in which form; having perhaps written with no view to publication, extraneous and alien as they felt it to be to them. Such authors, to be encountered frequently since the Romantic Age, 74 present such a variety of possibilities of articulation that the editor often feels acute incertitude about whom he is actually dealing with, what the author could have intended and what is to be accounted for as within his potential range. Yet a proper awareness of the author's perspective may still guide the editor towards an unbiassed perception of the textual conditions. Here, then, it is an author himself, as it were, who induces the restrictions of the editor's text-critical faculty of judgment. By accepting them, the editor respects the author's identity as manifest in his creative behaviour. Given that every textual version, regardless of when it originated or how it was transmitted, may have an equal claim to being rendered in extenso , every version, too, deserves the same measure of editorial attention. 75 To the degree that authorised printings and authentic or authorised manuscripts are considered equal in respect of the text they document, their material differences gain significance. The material characteristics of the documents, both textual and bibliographical, which seemed only marginally relevant to the Weimar Goethe edition, have a central information value in the Academy edition. The detailed descriptions of the witnesses selected, which are contained in its apparatus volumes published since 1963, serve largely to justify both the record of texts and variants, and the genetic reconstruction. The record of the variants to the fully rendered text is not only complete, it is also presented by the same semeiographically exact method of transcription as the text itself. With regard to this uniform transcriptional method, the foreshortened record of variants in the apparatus ranks equal with the extensive presentation of the text. 76 The emphasis in both cases is on the attested text rather than the authorially intended one. In its main aim and method, the Academy edition is thus a document edition. 77 Moreover, with regard to the number of witnesses edited, each apparatus volume actually ranks higher than the corresponding text volume. 78 Where a scholarly edition is presented principally as a document edition, the spatial dimension appears more important than the temporal dimension. The text is understood primarily as an autonomous and visually perceptible art object of a semeiographic nature, not as an author's aurally perceptible verbal utterance, as under the reception-oriented editorial concept. Siegfried Scheibe has expressed a sense of this modern editorial conception of the text with welcome clarity: "An editor's aptitude is revealed by his ability first to visualise a manuscript full of corrections as if blank and untouched, in order then to recognise and to infer, as far as possible, how, in discrete stages of composition, the blank pages were filled with the characters and symbols of a 'text', and how parts of this 'text' changed while others remained constant." 79 Scheibe also conceives of the genetic development of a literary work according to such an inscriptional process of textual construction: the genetic stages in the work's development correspond to the textualised states of its pre-versions and versions ( ibid. , pp. 16-17, 28). This is a useful notion of text and text development in editorial terms, since it promotes a semeiographic analysis in close documentary harmony with the reproduction of the textual witnesses. In the Academy edition, it has proved profitable for the handling of the immediate witnesses to Goethe's work and that of his assistants, i.e. , the manuscripts themselves. Their variants are rendered with the greatest attention to differentiating detail. Transcribing the manuscript variants with utmost exactitude, the edition may be said to approximate quite closely Goethe's working procedures; it certainly comes closer to them than does the Weimar edition in its selective apparatus of readings. To be more precise: in its mode of editorial presentation the Academy edition has been adapted to the author's working method by means of a differentiated rendering of the results of the work process: the acts of alteration are captured in their results, and the results in turn are viewed as integral to states or versions of the text. The author's work process is thus properly speaking only indirectly documented and does not itself become the subject of editorial presentation. Deleted passages and the structured spatial arrangement of the text (variants as spatially co-ordinated textual elements) are therefore not identified. 80 Scheibe's concept of text and text development serves in the Academy edition not only as an instrument of editorial analysis, but also as the aim of editorial presentation. The written traces of the author's working procedures seem worth accounting for only in as far as they lead to new versions of the text; what they may mean with regard to the author appears largely irrelevant. The dominant perspective is that of a reader who, provided with an edited text and variants, may combine, as in a puzzle, those versions of the text and strands of text development which at any given moment he desires . In gaining a sense of text production, he is thus brought closer to the author. The model of the author in the 3rd person: the author concealing himself as a producer of texts Introducing the radical historicism of some of the volumes in the Goethe Academy edition means assuming the perspective of the re-producing editor as normative. If all versions of the text which the author has produced or assisted in are declared equivalent in principle, it is wholly for the editor to decide which one he should reproduce in full. Authorial decisions in this matter have no force. The author becomes a subject without intersubjectively binding intentions if what distinguishes the texts he published from those he left unpublished is nothing but their material state in prints and manuscripts. In other words: the obligation of respect for Goethe's decisions as to how he wished readers to understand his works and himself loses its validity. The editor's obligation towards the author is replaced by his obligation towards the scholarly users of critical editions. 81 The ethos of the—modern—editor is thus basically object-oriented, its concerns are the oeuvre and the text. Hence, the demands raised by the supporters of the production-oriented concept for greater objectivity in critical editing are largely, if not exclusively, to be understood as a desire to strengthen its text orientation. 82 They feel responsible mainly towards the users of editions to whom methodologically verifiable information is due about the author's texts and their transmission. 83 The author, on the whole, is reduced to the role of a producing supplier of texts and text versions which editorially creative skill re-produces for all manner of uses. Intentionality is envisaged mainly in the general sense that an author must be supposed to have intended to produce everything he wrote, which is tantamount to rendering the notion of authorial intention irrelevant. 84 The author's willed disposition of intention is conceded only in relation to isolated instances of more or less obvious error. These are also regarded, however, under a perspective that places the author in the position of a third person: is x, y, z intended by him , could it be expected of him ? It stands to the credit of the Academy edition that it has established a terminology providing the most discriminatory editorial instrument hitherto developed. 85 It bears the unmistakable imprint of a double focus on textual production (author) and textual re-production (editor/reader). 86 Two examples may serve to illustrate its inherent focal constraints. Firstly, the editors are ready to admit that they have not succeeded in articulating an "unequivocal" definition of "an author's work (= opus )" ( ibid. , pp. 16-17). The reason is that they have posed the question exclusively from a point of view of editorial text orientation and editorial concerns. Individual and authorially integrated texts of course present no real definition problems. Yet a definition becomes difficult if not ultimately impossible in cases where textual criteria do not exist, e.g. , when an author has contributed to a collaborative publication or revised the texts of others for publication. Obviously his contributive pieces cannot be termed "works". Where should the line be drawn? Should self-contained additions be claimed for the "works"? Yet these may be related to revisions elsewhere for which the author is not himself responsible. The matter cannot be decided solely with reference to the author's producing role. His role as a reader-recipient needs also to be considered. Significant for the author is not only his "work", i.e., the text he has himself composed, but every text, whether written by himself or not, which he can read and affirm as a representation of his life and his self and which he can thus adopt as his own. The corrective revisions for publication and ultimately the published versions themselves of texts by himself or others provide evidence of such authorial attitudes of identification. The author's willed identity appears ultimately disregarded if an edition takes indications of his judicious reading behaviour into full consideration only when recognisable from his self-produced texts but treats them selectively when found in the texts of others. Admittedly, to come into focus at all where only the productive side of the author is relevant, such indications of a judicious receptivity towards his own texts or those of others have to be text-genetically misinterpreted as evidence of productive activity, or else disregarded altogether. If the Weimar edition shows that its editors could make little of a Goethe self-absorbed in the production of his texts, yet much of a Goethe conscious in revision of how they should and would be read, the reverse is true of the editors of the Academy edition. By default of their methodology, they saw little to interest them in a Goethe revisionally shaping public texts. 87 Secondly: the predominance of the idea of the author as a producer of texts has consequences for the concept of authorisation, which becomes directly or indirectly correlated to the author's productive behaviour. Accordingly, the term does not denote the author's affirmative reading of texts as expressions of permanence of his self. Rather, it classifies witness documents as authorially produced or co-produced (holographs or scribal copies with autograph corrections), or else as authorially induced or instigated (scribal copies, prints). Documents demonstrably originating directly or indirectly through authorial activity are regarded as authorised. The purpose of the concept is to distinguish the editorially relevant witnesses from the irrelevant ones. 88 The criterion, however, is helpful only in the case of the non-authentic documents, the scribal copies and prints; that autograph manuscripts are relevant witnesses is self-evident. The concept of 'authorisation' is in truth meaningless for variant selection, though not for genetic reconstruction of texts performed by editors and users of critical editions. The tendency to equate authorially written text and authorised text carries considerable consequences for the assessment of text versions derived from the author's manuscripts. 89 Over-estimation of authorial composition due to modal misinterpretation Within the terminology of the Goethe Academy edition the term "textual version" occupies a position of particular significance. 90 It is defined as follows: "Textual versions are completed or uncompleted executions of a work which diverge. They are related to one another by textual identity and distinguished by their textual variance." Textual variance means a divergence in execution in terms of letters and punctuation. A revised manuscript may hence contain several textual versions (at the base level and the levels of revision). If such a manuscript is a holograph, all the versions contained within it are by definition authorised. What the author wrote is thus equated with what he intended. But what does this mean? Viewed logically, what is, and what can only be intended in this case is an adequate written expression of the author's imaginative perceptions. The distinctions between writing, expression and perception have disappeared, and writing appears equated with language representation. Whereas, under the reception-oriented editorial concept, writing is seen primarily from the reader's perspective as a merely reproductive act, it is the perspective of the writer activating his imaginative powers that dominate here. The author is viewed primarily as a producer recording his perceptions and, in doing so, evoking new ones. He is seen much less as a reader judging the written expression by whether it corresponds to his original perception or not. It follows that even that part of the author's work which he executed primarily in his capacity of reader is regarded as the production of new text. This new text, a version in relation to the earlier one, is by the editor judged to be a newly composed text which the author inscribed by means of variant notation merely to save labour. However, if textual versions really are newly composed texts that only accidentally appear in the form of variants, even these cannot really be variants, i.e. , alternative possibilities of expression, but must be the definitive textual elements of distinct text versions. 91 Such modal misinterpretation of the variants as definitive components of authorial expression in new textual versions leads directly to the situation whereby the process of revision is understood as textual production and is consequently over-estimated. It is a characteristic feature of the reception-oriented editorial concept to assume that what the author ultimately intends is an imagined and affirmable idea of himself as a person, in relation to which his creative ability of expression is secondary. Under the production-oriented editorial concept, the author appears in the inverse role: the primary regard is for the author's creative ability applied as boundlessly as possible; the will to commit ever-changing perceptions to inscriptional permanence is secondary. The notions of an accomplished expression and a perfected work can no longer be held; there remain only versions of the work in temporal succession that each represent new authorial attitudes. Accordingly, the identity of the author whose perceptions continually change finds expression not so much in the work as in the process of perception, i.e., the author's working procedures. It is these that provide the real constant factor in the creative activity, and it was these that the editors aimed to bring to the fore in the Academy edition ( ibid. , p. 15), albeit in such a way that they might be understood as the means of textual production. The Goethe Academy edition tellingly demonstrates that a preference for the author's productive rather than his receptive behaviour typically reflects a time-bound cultural self-image of those involved with literature. As will be clear, it is an attitude which is not suggested by Goethe's works themselves or their transmission, and which is far better suited to the works and manuscripts of more recent poets and writers who more often display a stronger leaning towards the productive function of writing than to the revisional one. In the case of such authors, versions of a work relating to each other in terms of identity and variance are usually scarcer than utterly divergent versions in the nature of independent texts. Hölderlin's manuscripts also appear to reflect a primarily text-producing author. The Frankfurt Hölderlin edition is the only critical edition making a principle of an unrestricted presentation of the author's working procedures by means of manuscript facsimiles and diplomatic transcriptions ("typographic transcriptions"); at its core is a genetic reproduction ("linear representation") of the text. Faithful to its sources, and judiciously incorporating references to their graphics and topography where it synthesizes text by genetically conceived phase divisions, it nevertheless reflects Dieter Sattler's, its editor's, governing interest in the production and re-production of texts. Sattler himself draws attention to the fact that precisely this "process analysis" of manuscript findings and the consequent "textual constitution" are dependent upon editorial interpretation. 92 He also contributes to interpreting this interest in the author's productive behaviour in terms of a history of ideas when he declares for his own edition: "In its approach, it goes beyond the usual aims of literary scholarship in the same measure as it leaves a mental pigeon-holing behind [. . .]. Thus, if this poetry, achieved through self-sacrifice, is no longer given over to be enjoyed, if instead it serves an understanding of the necessity for individual and general opposition to 'imposed laws and their executors', the gain will actually depend less on the artificial end products than on the conditions and steps by which such thinking becomes aware of itself [. . .]. It would be worth relearning the power of thought which moves beyond its own self-sufficiency, the ultimate superiority of individual integrity over systems that survive only by calculated opportunism" ( ibid. , pp. 124-125). This reveals a decided preference for a type of poet who develops his ideas as independently as possible of considerations for others, of readers' expectations or their ability to understand his poetry, and who therefore has little need for self-distancing or self-censorship. It is an authorial condition preeminently attainable in the state of first writing down a text, yet less so in revising it. The genetic reconstruction of texts preserved in manuscript may hence be conceived as a means of penetrating towards the most freely imaginative author who, in this sense, is also the most individual one. His identity is often mysterious, indeterminable, to be reached out for only in such reconstruction. This model of the author reflects the self-image of the scholar definable by his interest in textual genesis. The quality which he values most in the author he claims also for himself, i.e. , a minimal consideration for the community of readers and their wishes, which in turn means the greatest possible degree of individuation and boundlessness of self-being. Interest in supra-individual aims of authors is replaced by the greatest possible openness towards their reproducible procedures of composition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The author's working procedures as a reflection of his sense of self-being Editors who adhere to the production-oriented editorial concept consider it an important task of the critical edition to illustrate the author's working procedures, be it indirectly by documenting and describing the work's entire development and presenting the alterations it underwent, or be it directly by providing reproductions of working manuscripts. However, they do not acknowledge this process of illustrating working procedures as an end in itself. Its principal aim is to serve as a control of the editor's presentation of the text and its variants. This is also the primary function of the manuscript facsimiles and their "typographic transcriptions" for instance in the Frankfurt Hölderlin edition. Even their high degree of documentary authenticity in relation to the author's working procedures is really only to be understood as evidence corresponding to the meticulous reconstruction of the genetic textual conditions. Yet do the writer's working procedures merit observation and documentation only with regard to their text-genetic results? Are they of interest merely by their workshop handling of texts and variants, and not also as the author's medium of expression? In other words: are these procedures valuable only as a guide to new genetic states of greatest possible textual authenticity, and not in themselves as a mode of articulation of the writer who by their means created his texts? In one respect, that of revision, the answer must be in the affirmative. Writers, especially in earlier periods of literary history, have repeatedly insisted how important critical reading and re-reading was for them and the consequent alterations of their texts. Pliny the Younger provides exemplary evidence in a letter justifying the written dissemination of his speeches to readers by describing with what critical care—and advice by friends—he revised and corrected the text of a speech: " Itaque nullum emendandi genus omitto . Ac primum quae scripsi mecum ipse pertracto; deinde duobus aut tribus lego; mox aliis trado adnotanda, notasque eorum, si dubito, cum uno rursus aut altero pensito; novissime pluribus recito, ac si quid mihi credis tunc acerrime emendo; nam tanto diligentius quanto sollicitius intendo. Optime autem reverentia pudor metus iudicant ". 93 Acknowledging an habitual behaviour as important for himself, an author will also regard it as noteworthy in literary colleagues. 94 Lessing, for example, in reviewing Klopstock's Copenhagen edition of Messias , discusses its revisions at great length. As an author turned critic, he holds up many instances of Klopstock's textual changes for demonstration and gives a reason for the trouble he is taking: "Changes and improvements made by a poet like Klopstock in his works deserve not only to be noted, but to be studied with the greatest diligence. By studying them one can learn the finest rules of art; for what the art's masters well choose to observe attains to the force of rules." 95 This was written in 1759, and thus at a time when literary good taste was still acknowledged by writers and readers alike as a bond securing a shared sense of the appropriate. The authors had the task of guiding taste in so far as they took it upon themselves to improve their own artistic sensibility by diligently studying master works of art, and by applying it in turn to their own works to improve the sensibilities of their readers. A writer who wished to be respected within the community of the literate did well to apply the highest degree of literary judgement to his works. The field to exercise his studied artistic sensibility was above all the redaction and revision of his own texts and not their conception or production. This exercise, however, was not a matter of "studium", but of "ingenium" or "genius", an outflow of the individual's powers of imagination and inspiration, and thus largely removed from conscious control. An author who ceaselessly improved his works in accordance with literary good taste thereby announced his claim to being counted among the better authors. 96 The extent of the revisions he undertook in relation to the actual conception and production therefore indicates the degree to which he saw himself as a community being and wished to be recognised as such by others. 97 Where this urge is about equal to the urge for creative individualisation, as for instance with Goethe or Schiller in their classic periods, the relationship also finds expression in the working procedures. Given favourable conditions of transmission, it is relatively easy to distinguish procedural phases: the primarily productive phase of the preliminaries (notes, sketches, plans) and drafts (the drafting of individual segments, first integral inscription of a whole text) on the one hand, and the primarily revisional phase (fair copy, scribal copy, printer's copy, proofs) on the other hand. 98 Such working procedures have a strong and purposeful forward direction even at an early developmental stage. The author begins relatively early after the initial inspiration to work towards an opus , even though he may be gaining clarity about its content and form only as it progresses. The purposefulness of his working procedures mirrors his teleological self-conception; his search for perfection in a literary work reflects his will to a perfection of his personal existence. Despite all possible individual distancing, his powers of imagination are bound to a traditional image of man which he accepts as the highest standard of his existence and self-being. It is not only his creative imagination which is more or less dominated by such self-determination; his entire work as an author is also so dominated. This means that his work is very much oriented towards publication. For the author can only relate positively to himself as a person if he succeeds in objectifying what he recognises as the essence of that self, raising it to permanence and providing for its unlimited internalisation by others. It is thus for the sake both of his literary and, above all, of his personal self-affirmation that this type of author views himself primarily as a community being. In this sense his consideration for the literate reading public is genuine. To the extent that the regulatory power of an objectifiable image of man loses validity for the author's self-conception, his imaginative activity begins to develop its own, and often superior, dynamics. Correspondingly, the creative aspect (the recording, combination and evocation of perceptions) gains significance for his work, while the process of revision loses its functional essence. No longer limited to the revising of completed texts and text segments, it extends to the development of new texts and segments. Revision ceases to be clearly distinguishable from text production, which itself in turn, moreover, becomes increasingly characterised by an over-abundance of immediate, as opposed to retarded, changes. Recent German poets, e.g., Georg Heym, Georg Trakl, Franz Kafka, 99 offer numerous examples of such characteristics in their working materials. Authorial working procedures directed primarily towards productive writing cannot provide a fruitful object for studying an author's artistic will in the sense of the Lessing quotation above. 100 They belong to a type of author less concerned with realising his artistic will or public recognition as a superior writer than with individual self-realisation through the most boundless development of his imagination. The more he opens himself to his imagination and allows himself to be overwhelmed by it, the more his writing loses the quality of a purposeful finite activity divisible into phases such as preliminaries, drafts and revision. It develops a tendency, rather, of becoming a mode of existence with which the author exclusively identifies and in which he would wish to dwell for as long as possible. Baudelaire and Flaubert, those founding fathers of the literature of modernism, really did not wish to be anything but poets. Consequently, their pronouncements on literary work in truth bear witness to their individual lives and are meaningful only to themselves or their intimate friends. Baudelaire, the champion of "gouvernement de l'imagination", 101 records in a collection of notes: "Si tu travaillais tous les jours, la vie te serait plus supportable. Travaille [six] jours sans relâche. [. . .] Je suppose que j'attache ma destinée à un travail non interrompu de plusieurs heures." 102 Flaubert, who called himself "l'homme-plume", 103 often refers to his working procedures in letters. They bore unmistakable traits of obsession, sustained as they were by a "génie de la gestation, une sorte de jubilation, qu'on peut, si l'on s'en prend à l'homme, qualifier de folle ou de perverse." 104 In the course of composing Emma Bovary's seduction he commented: "Que cela continue! car je suis fatigué de mes lenteurs. Mais je redoute le réveil, les désillusions des pages recopiées! N'importe, bien ou mal, c'est une délicieuse chose que d'écrire, que de ne plus être soi , mais de circuler dans toute la création dont on parle." 105 In a similar spirit Kafka records his mood of depression in situations when the imagination failed him in his writing, or that of an intoxicatingly inspiring extasy in moments when it ran free. 106 He appears himself to have sensed a spiritual affinity with Flaubert. Commenting on a few manuscript pages for L'Education sentimentale , he wrote: "The crossed-out pages [. . .] do not represent nights of failing energy. On the contrary, these are the very pages in which he wholly immersed himself, in which he lost himself to every human eye. And even when writing these pages for the third time, he experienced [. . .] this infinite happiness." 107 In his diary, Kafka articulated how much he considered productive writing as the only form of existence commensurate with his self: "When I became aware within my whole organism that writing was the most fruitful direction of my being, everything thronged towards it and rendered void all other abilities, directed towards the joys of sex, eating, drinking, philosophical reflection and, above all, music. I emaciated in all these directions." 108 Writers who find their life's fulfilment in activating their imagination by writing are, as a rule, scarcely able to adopt a clear stance towards the results of their writing. Their relationship to their texts is basically ambivalent. It tends to be positive as long as the texts provide a continued or renewed stimulus for the imagination, yet negative when the animation fails or cannot be experienced any longer. 109 Flaubert copied or rewrote passages from his novels or made "recopiages" (copies of pages of books he had read) to put himself into a productive mood: "Certes Flaubert lit pour se documenter, mais aussi et surtout par débauche imaginative, et ce sont les mots qui le debauchent." 110 And Kafka, clearly, was virtually incapable of substantially improving his short stories in revision. His ability of critical (re-)reading was little developed. Hence, his publications do not express decisions freely taken by himself and specifically relating only to his texts. They are determined, rather, by external factors alien to the author and to the text. 111 The typical uncertainty of the authors mentioned with respect to what their texts might mean to readers taking a receptive attitude towards them signifies their fundamental lack of consideration for a readership altogether. 112 Such lack is not so much involuntary in the individual as a mode of intentional behaviour. The authors—and they are not only modern ones, as the example of Montaigne shows 113 —view themselves primarily as individuals and wish to be seen and accepted as such by others. Their daily existence becomes unbearable to the extent that this self-image is not acknowledged. In the same measure, literary writing assumes for them the significance of an authentic form of existence. Bearing no relation to real persons, it excludes the everyday world from its field of reference, and it is also creative, since the imagination can repress thoughts of an everyday community existence and blot them out in moments of happiness. Documents of a mode of literary writing which, in fulfilling an author's wish to be understood preeminently as an individual, constitutes an essential articulation of his assumed form of life, are in this sense also biographic documents. This is increasingly true: the more significant that productive writing was for the author and the less important its textual results, the greater the indeterminacy or secrecy in his work or being, and the more clearly the work process shows signs of spontaneous inceptions or abrupt conclusions (indiscriminate use of available writing space, such as old letters, café menus, envelopes, pages torn from copybooks). 114 Such manuscript leaves body forth an author's innermost life sphere rather than his workshop activities. They are not merely the sources for "textologists" interested in reconstructing the genetic versions of the text, but witnesses sui generis which crave attention for their own sake.</field>

He terms unpublished versions "potential versions", published ones "actual versions": "The editor should first distinguish between 'potential' and 'actual' versions. Any versions which are not communicated to the public—like drafts or working versions—may be 'potential' works of art" (p. 187). One is reminded of Horace's famous dictum in De arte poetica , 389-390: "delere licebit, / quod non edideris, nescit vox missa reverti." ("You may still delete what you have not published; once escaped, the word knows no return.") 34 It is approximately in this sense that Hans Zeller first defined the term "authorised" (=declared valid by the author) in his article "Textkritik" in Das Fischer Lexikon , vol. 35/2 (Literatur 2/2), Frankfurt, 1965, p. 559. Zeller later adopted the definition of the Goethe Academy edition (see below). 35 Göttling; cf.

"I feel that in all the classics, the reader, whoever he may be, should be treated in such a way that he does not feel the need for any middleman between himself and the author.

The author is attributed with super-human traits in order that one may fully entrust oneself to him. 53 Beissner did not provide a definition of the terms when he introduced the distinction between authorial (Entstehungs-) and transmissional variants (Überlieferungs-Varianten) (see note 27). 54 For the notion of a 'poet edition', see Hans Joachim Kreutzer, Überlieferung und Edition .

"Il existait une sorte d'Éthique de la forme qui conduisait au travail infini. [. . .] On s'éloigne par là des conditions 'naturelles' ou ingénues de la Littérature, et l'on vient insensiblement à confondre la composition d'un ouvrage de l'esprit, qui est chose finie , avec la vie de l'esprit même,—lequel est une puissance de transformation toujours en acte. On en arrive au travail pour le travail. Aux yeux de ces amateurs d'inquiétude et de perfection, un ouvrage n'est jamais achevé ,—mot qui pour eux n'a aucun sens,—mais abandonné ; et cet abandon, qui le livre aux flammes ou au public (et qu'il soit l'effet de la lassitude ou de l'obligation de livrer), leur est une sorte d' accident , comparable à la rupture d'une réflexion, que la fatique, le fâcheux, ou quelque sensation viennent rendre nulle."

Objectiveness in this sense is obviously important for any concept of critical editing. 83 This explains the endeavour to structure the terminology and methodology of editing as comprehensively as possible; cf. for example Hans Zeller, "Braucht die Editionslehre eine Fachsprache?"

Scheibe, "Zu einigen Grundprinzipien", pp. 14-15. 87 In so far as revisional work for Goethe increased with his age, the attitude of the Academy edition to the author and his work might also be characterised by saying that the editors felt closer to the young than to the old Goethe. 88 Cf. Scheibe, "Zu einigen Grundprinzipien", pp. 28-29; the definition recurs with only minor modifications in "Zum editorischen Problem", pp. 18-21. 89 "Author's manuscripts" are in fact defined so as to include both scribal copies and proofs that were authorially revised. 90 Scheibe, "Zu einigen Grundprinzipien", pp. 17-19; "Zum editorischen Problem", p. 28. 91 Substitutional variants are therefore generally viewed as corrections: "All alterations of the basic level (deletions, additions, rearrangements, singly or in combination) as well as alterations of corrections are corrections ."

Verg. 22.) 94 Johann Christoph Wagenseil (1633-1705) had an early opportunity to observe Petrarch's stylistic revisions of his Canzoniere in the autograph preserved in the Vatican library (Vat. lat. 3196), and he quotes at length the library custodian's comments: "It is extremely fortunate that Petrarch only lightly deleted what did not please him, leaving it still legible, so that, both for amusement and gain, one may compare his first and last thoughts and see what he deemed inappropriate and how he improved it. How desirable were it—the custodian added—still to possess in like manner the notebooks of the Greek and Latin poets.

("Literarischer Sansculottismus", first published in Horen , 1795, St. 5; WA I, 40, p. 201.) 97 The classic example of this type of author is Petrarch, whose stylistic improvements to the Canzoniere (see note 94) in some instances extended over many years. ( Cf. Carl Appel, Zur Entwicklung italienischer Dichtungen Petrarcas . Halle, 1891, pp. 20-116.) Apart from the revisions themselves, which aim at harmonious perfection of the lyric utterance, the revisional notes in Latin concerning the need for correction or the degree to which single passages and texts are complete show how much the writing is held in control by a discerning faculty of judgement sensible of effects.

      <field name="heading_text">Some Notes on Letter Editions: With Special Reference to German Writers by Siegfried Scheibe *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The editing of correspondence has increased considerably in the German-speaking countries over the past few decades. Numbers of editions of letters written by and to historic personages were begun, opening up major new materials and sources, especially from the 18th to the middle of the 20th century. In the GDR alone, just to mention that country, letter editions of the following personages are being published: Christoph Martin Wieland, Georg Forster, Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottfried Herder, Adelbert von Chamisso, Heinrich Heine, Alexander von Humboldt, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The special form of a calendar edition of all letters to Johann Wolfgang Goethe should also be mentioned in this context. However, the aforementioned editions are confined to historical and critical letter editions which always comprise both the letters written by a given author and those addressed to him. In addition, numerous collections of letters (partly complete, partly selective) of German and foreign writers, artists, scientists and politicians were published in the GDR in the form of so-called study editions or reading editions on which I do not want to elaborate here. Scholars take a great interest in direct statements made by such persons in letters available to us: they provide important information about the living conditions of these persons and problems relating to their work, comments on other persons from among the author's acquaintances, and, last but not least, information about the period in which the author lived and worked. Such information is hardly available otherwise in such a condensed, although always subjective, form. The host of recent letter editions, e.g. those reflecting the 18th century, will largely add to and differentiate the picture of that period in scholarly research. The interest of the general public in such letter editions, however, is more difficult to estimate. At least the publishers complain about the fact that letter editions which are intended for a wide audience do not sell easily. But I do not want to dwell upon the economic problems that are always associated with letter editions, and historical and critical editions in general. I will deal with some concrete problems we encountered in the editing of letters by and to Georg Forster and Christoph Martin Wieland. They are certainly of significance for the editing of correspondence beyond the two editions and may stimulate the discussion on aspects of letter editing, which has been not so pronounced so far. Dealing with a "letter", we must know first of all what it is, as the postal definition of a letter is not sufficient nor applicable for our purposes. It seems more appropriate to begin with a purely formal definition of the term. A letter could be described as a text which begins with a salutation and ends with a signature. Anywhere in this text there will be a date and the place where the letter was written. This formal definition of a letter, however, is not sufficient to differentiate it from a work composed in the form of a letter. A "literary letter" may also have a salutation and a signature or even a date and a real letter may lack these particulars fully or in part. Hence, the definition of a "letter" must also include criteria relating to its contents such as the following: the letter is addressed to a person who is not in the same place (room) with the letter-writer. The letter contains a message, information or orders which could be given to the addressee orally in about the same way if he were present. And the message, information or orders contained in a letter are only meant for the addressee (and possibly a narrow circle of other persons such as dependants and friends) and the writer did not intend to publish them in this form. So the decisive criteria relating to a letter's contents are its message character on the one hand, and the intimate character of the information on the other. From this we can derive the following summary definition of a letter: By a "letter" we understand written messages, information or orders which are meant to inform other persons (the addressees) and which were not written for publication. As a rule, they have a standard form beginning with a salutation, ending with a signature and frequently containing a date. This definition, for one thing, covers a major part of what we are generally inclined to classify under the term "letter". These things pose no problems when being included in a letter edition, namely (apart from actual letters) notes, postcards, telegrams and other things of this kind, i.e., texts which contain a message meant for an addressee. But in reality we encounter a number of other messages, pieces of information or orders which, as far as their form and structure is concerned, comply with the definition of a letter but which at least give rise to some doubt as to whether they should be classified as a "letter" and thus be included in a letter edition. Some cases in point will illustrate this. Until far into the 19th century, IOUs, bills of exchange, and other business documents were commonly written in the form of letters, which makes them conform to the above-mentioned definition of a letter with regard to contents and form. However, these are usually "letters" we would not send like that today but take a printed form to be filled in instead. If such records were available in the compilation of material relating to a 20th-century author it would not occur to anyone to regard such filled-in forms, e.g. for financial matters, as letters and include them in a letter edition. Other borderline cases are inscriptions in books and entries in autograph books, etc. Just like a letter they also contain a message to the addressee (although autograph book entries are often made in the addressee's presence) and their basic structure is also that of a letter. The message they contain, unlike a message in a letter, does not constitute a piece of information which is valid only for a certain period but is supposed to preserve and confirm the memory of a given person or visitor. On the other hand, there are also actual letters which were written for the sole purpose of lasting remembrance and thus hardly differ from book inscriptions or autograph-book entries as regards their contents. Therefore, when preparing a letter edition, the editor has to make the important preliminary decision of whether or not to include such messages of a letter-like nature. All letter-like records mentioned so far contain statements about the author, his living conditions, his encounters and conversations with other persons, all of which may be relevant to his biography. So it is indeed desirable to present them in an edition in order to make them accessible to research. However, whether to include them in the letter edition itself cannot be said in general but has to be decided largely pragmatically. The decision is relatively easy in the case of a complete edition of all the works of an author planned to comprise volumes with biographical records, records of conversations and other material of this kind: here the records mentioned above may be clearly related to biographical ones and should be printed as such. If, however, a pure letter edition is planned or a complete edition of works and letters where such biographical records would not appear, then it will be harder to decide to exclude this material. Moreover, it is often very difficult to differentiate exactly between such records and actual letters, for various types of records may always mingle in various ways. For instance, among Georg Forster's there are some "pure" letters which contain an IOU or a bill in their text. This gives rise to the question why these financial documents that appear within a letter are included in the edition, while separate such documents are not. Even a restriction to the calendar form (i.e. the paraphrasing of such a "letter") does not leave the editor in a better position, as the calendar version will hardly be shorter than the "letter" itself. It is therefore more appropriate (and makes an interpretation less ambiguous) if the original form of the text is reproduced. But it is not only problems like these that we are often faced with when preparing letter editions. Many of the authors we have to deal with were not "free-lance writers" all their life but often had an occupation where letter-writing was one of their functions. These letters are not private statements by these persons but official notices of an authority, institution, etc. On the other hand, they were also addressed to a private person or another authority, which makes them comply with our above definition of a letter, i.e. they contain messages, information or orders for a specific addressee. And their contents and gist are largely determined by their author, whose individual style can be identified even if he had to adapt it to the set officialese. Such correspondence is mostly known as "official letters". Just like personal statements by the author they are relevant to his biography, often making him appear in a way different from his literary work. That is why the inclusion of such letters in a letter edition should not be precluded from the start. (In the case of Goethe, for example, it is indeed relevant that in the criminal case of a woman child-murderer, as an official person he demanded that she should be sentenced while as a dramatist he pronounced a moral acquittal on Gretchen in Faust .) German letter editions used to do without such "official letters". Meanwhile, there is at least a trend towards including such letters, as the scholarly community wishes to get an impression of the author that is as comprehensive as possible. Goethe again provides an interesting example for developments when it comes to including official letters: there were no such letters in an edition of Goethe's letters published at the turn of the century. In 1949, a series to publish his Amtliche Schriften ("Official Works") was begun. At first the editors believed that they could restrict the series to actual works or "writings", i.e. comments on certain facts with which Goethe dealt in his capacity as a minister in Weimar. Soon they realized that letters should be included as well and eventually they saw that there was an interaction between official and purely private messages and that full understanding was possible only in their overall context. Goethe did not only give official comments on most official affairs. He often used private correspondence as well in order to give his opinion on an official matter, discuss a decision to be made in advance, or provoke a certain attitude towards this matter in other people. And he also used letters with largely official contents for adding personal messages. So the boundaries between Goethe's official and private spheres are fluid. But this is not only true of Goethe if we think of what we do when writing private or official letters. The more intimate the terms on which we are with the addressee, the more statements on private and official occasions mingle, which frequently renders a clear distinction between the two types of messages impossible. Even if there is an alternation between distinctive official and private correspondence to the same person, one letter will often not be understood without knowing the other. If an edition is restricted to private letters, at least the relevant annotations should quote major parts of the official letters in order to explain allusions or statements. However, where this is frequently necessary, the question arises whether a letter edition should not be designed from the start so that it may include both private and official letters, as it was done in the edition of Georg Forster's letters. Another problem case is formed by letters an author wrote in his capacity of "correspondent" of a newspaper or "corresponding member" of an institution. Today these terms are merely regarded as a kind of title without an obligation to correspond, whereas in the 18th century these words were applied in accordance with their meaning: they refer to persons who sent letters with information to a newspaper or institution. In these letters they reported news from the various scientific, cultural or political fields they dealt with or took a particular interest in. This occurs with both Georg Forster and his father, Johann Reinhold Forster, and especially in the period when they lived and worked in England. We hold letters written by them to the Berlin publisher Johann Karl Philipp Spener whose publishing house was responsible for the Haude und Spenersche Zeitung , one of the major newspapers in Prussia. These letters embody normal personal statements side by side with information and news about recent research and research findings in England, about scientific literature and fiction there, about the theatre, about political affairs in England, etc., which were expressly meant to be published in Spener's newspapers. (We find the same in letters by Johann Reinhold Forster to Christian Gottlob Heyne, a professor in Göttingen and editor of the Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen , a journal which did not only publish reviews but also information about recent research both at his own academy and at academies abroad.) As long as such letters are available to us in their original form, i.e. as a mixture of private statements and official information, their inclusion in a letter edition will be beyond dispute. The problem becomes more intractable if there is no record of the letter concerned, while we find a notice in a newspaper or journal which might read: "Our correspondent in London reports the following news", mostly followed by direct quotations. It is irrelevant whether the name of the correspondent appears or whether it can be deduced from the topic and way of presentation. What must be decided is what to do with this text: whether it constitutes a letter to be included in the edition or not. It may be argued in this case that the text in the form available does not comply with our definition of a letter, as it is information meant for a wide circle of readers and written for the purpose of being printed. But this can be countered by saying that this kind of text was not composed directly in the form of a work (an essay, for instance) but that the facts were originally told in a normal letter where personal and general information was integrated. In this respect, this is first of all always personal information, which the publisher of the newspaper or journal never published in full but from which he selected those items that he deemed to be of general interest based on the situation in his country. Since there is enough documentary evidence for the fact that such correspondent news was indeed part of normal letters which no doubt would be reproduced in a letter edition, the news by a given correspondent as quoted in newspapers and journals must also be included in a letter edition. While in all problem cases outlined so far we find a trend towards including records of the kinds mentioned in a letter edition, this may probably be ruled out from the start in the case of what is known as an "open letter". This special form of a letter was definitely written for publication and, as a rule, became known to the addressee only as published. An "open letter" may be considered as a specific type of essay which, just like the "literary letters" mentioned earlier in this paper, was couched in the outer appearance of a letter without being one. I have so far no evidence that an essay published as an "open letter" has ever been sent directly to the addressee as a letter. If, however, this should occur, then this particular letter, which will be on hand as a manuscript or typescript, definitely belongs in a letter edition, while an "open letter" published in this form equally definitely belongs in the edition of the works of the author concerned where all his other "open letters" should be reproduced, too. However, a distinction must be made between this and a form of polemic letter publication which was quite common particularly in the 18th century in connection with a controversy among various writers or scholars. In this case, the rivals initially exchanged private letters which were not meant for publication. Only as the controversy escalated the one, and sometimes also the other, resolved to go public, give a generalized account of the facts and substantiate them by publishing his own letters or those from his rival. Hence, such publications contain letters which definitely belong in a letter edition of the given person, while the summary essays (including the letters reproduced in them) must be regarded as a work and thus belong in an edition of the works even if they are written in the form of an "open letter". I suppose that our definition and the additional remarks have shown what should be included in a letter edition as a "letter". This, however, does not solve all the problems associated with the inclusion of letters in an edition because we must now differentiate between the individual letters of an author. While so far we asked: what is a letter?, we must now answer the question: what is one letter? Here we can start out from the formal definition given at the beginning: a letter starts with a salutation and ends with a signature. Does this rule also apply if a postscript is added? The function of postscripts is to embody additions to a given text of a letter. Hence they are supplements to the actual text of the letter which were usually written after the conclusion of the letter, i.e., after the writer had signed his name. In this respect, postscripts do not alter our formal definition of a letter, the body of which still ends with the signature. However, being supplements to letters, postscripts form a homogeneous whole together with the text of the letter and have to be published along with it. The case is different when a letter to addressee B is enclosed in a letter to addressee A with the request that A should hand over the enclosure to B. Here both the letter to A and that to B must be regarded as independent letters and have to appear separately in the edition. However, it should be indicated for both of them, in the description of the original record or in the annotations, that there is a certain relation between the two, i.e., that the one was an enclosure in the other. The decision becomes more difficult if the letter to B (who might be a relation of A's) immediately follows the letter to A, i.e. if it is written on the same sheet of paper. Here too, the decision whether this is one letter for two persons or two individual letters depends on the formal structure of the text. If the letter to B also contains a salutation and a signature (after the letter to A had been closed with a signature) it should be considered an independent letter and reproduced accordingly. If, however, the letter to A merely ends with a remark such as "And now some words to your wife", after which the text is immediately continued, then the letter should be regarded and printed as a homogeneous whole and the heading inserted by the editor should read "To A and B." The same applies where a letter is meant for two different persons who are possibly even alternately addressed in the text ("To A", "To B", "To both"). Here the formal unity of the letter, limited by the complementary close and signature, which are meant for either addressee, would compel the editor to assume one homogeneous letter and his heading should again be "To A and B". Finally, a special case is formed by those letters of an author where another person added a postscript or, in the reverse case, letters of another person where our author added a postscript. The decision on which parts of a given letter should be printed in the text section of an edition depends on the author to be edited: only his text (or, in correspondence editions, also the text addressed to him) is of primary relevance to the edition. Hence, the postscript added by another person would be completely disregarded when the letter is printed in this section of the edition and likewise only the postscript added by our author to another person's letter would appear whereas the letter itself would not. (In this case the editor should mark it "Postscript to a letter from A to B"). This regulation in this strict form only applies to the text section of a letter edition, for it can be assumed on principle that the author knew the other letter to which he added a postscript and that he also took notice of the other person's postscript to his own letter. Since these other texts may be relevant to the progress of the correspondence with the addressee it is always advisable to print them in full in the annotations or in connection with the description of the record. This is not only important for possible interpretations of relations between our author and the person who wrote the body of the letter or the postscript. It would also be a chance of opening a letter of this person up to the public. (It should go without saying that such complete reproductions of other texts are clearly indicated to the user in an edition's table of contents.) An edition, particularly a letter edition, should always attempt to present as much additional material as possible and reasonable which may give a more distinct picture of the author in the context of his personal circumstances and his period. (Note that I mean primary sources and not comments or interpretations on the part of the editor.) This also applies to the inclusion of letters written by a person close to the author (a relation, a friend, etc.) instead of the author himself. In connection with Georg Forster's Vilnius period, for instance, there are a number of letters written by his wife to her father, where she describes their life, pointing out that her husband has no time to write himself and conveying to her father requests and orders from her husband. Such letters are substitutes for letters not written and contain important personal and general statements which the author would have made himself if he had had the time to write. These facts are lost to research (or could be found only by chance or with difficulty) if substitute letters are not published within the framework of the edition. Although they should not be included in the series of letters of the author, i.e. not in the main section of the edition of this author's letters, they should be reproduced in an appendix to the given volume (with their contents also being reflected in the indexes) so that this important additional material can be used for purposes of scientific research. So far we have dealt with letters the text of which is directly available to us. In this context I ignore all problems arising from the kind of the records available, i.e. whether we have original letters, transcripts made by the author or others, more or less complete and reliable printed copies or only quotations of individual passages in other persons' letters or in autograph catalogues, etc. Nor do I wish to dwell upon the different treatment of these materials in editing and problems arising therefrom. This would be another subject. What remains to be discussed, however, is the question what we editors should do with letters of which there are no records. Because for every author we can assume that at least as many letters have been lost as have been preserved, if not that the number of letters lost exceeds that of surviving letters. In modern German editions it has become common practice to include in the edition also a certain part of lost letters, namely those for which there is direct evidence. On the one hand, this may be welcomed because it increases the number of known letters considerably and it may shed light on persons, as correspondents of the author, whose relations with the author have not been known so far. However, the inclusion of such inferred letters also brings problems, as the user is tempted to assume that now the edition covers all letters the author ever wrote or that were addressed to him. This would be a misinterpretation and the editor has to counter it in advance. But there is another important problem. Since the publication of Briefwechsel Wielands ("Wieland's Correspondence")—where this method was applied for the first time after 1945—it has become the practice in German letter editions that both recorded and inferred letters are put on one level and treated equally. Both types are printed in the text volume in chronological order and numbered equally. This, however, has major disadvantages: the date of an inferred letter cannot be definitely ascertained in most cases; the editor has to confine himself to giving a terminus ante quem instead. Now if a letter which was merely inferred so far is found—and this may happen relatively often despite all efforts to cover the whole material in preparing such an edition—there will at any rate be a discrepancy between the place in which the letter now is proved to have been written and the place were it was so far supposed to have been written on the basis of a vague date. Hence, a letter has to be inserted in the addenda to a letter volume already published in a place not marked before, while there is now a gap in another place which was marked so far. This cannot be avoided even if the editor takes pains to completely reconstruct the correspondence between the author and all his correspondents. It does not bring absolute certainty of the letters actually written either. But also every letter which was hitherto unknown (i.e. neither available as a record nor inferred) or which suddenly appears on the autograph market may entail the inference of a hitherto unknown letter which again has to be inserted subsequently in the order of the text volume already published. These two examples alone make it clear that recorded and inferred letters indeed cannot be considered equal nor treated equally in an edition. That is why their presentation within a homogeneous chronology is rather hazardous and does not provide the hoped-for exact survey of the author's correspondence. Therefore, a method applied to the recording of inferred letters in a number of Slavonic editions seems more appropriate: the two types of known letters are separated and treated differently in accordance with their differing significance. Only the recorded letters are printed in the text section of the edition whereas all inferred letters are referred to an appendix to the respective volume where their identifiable content is described. Thus, changes in the chronology, which may occur due to the finding of a letter which was hitherto merely inferred or due to the inference of other letters, do not have such serious effects on the arrangement and reproduction of recorded letters as in the German editions. Therefore, new or planned letter editions are recommended to apply this method which takes account of the differing significance of the two types of known letters. This method, however, does not affect the fact that it is useful for the user to be exactly informed in a letter edition also about the letters which can only be inferred. It may be important to name the criteria which make the inference of letters possible but also show the limits set to a safe procedure. Letters should be inferred in the following circumstances: —The previous letter contains a notice of reply and mostly a date for reply as well. This date, however, is not always identical with the letter's date as we can see when comparing recorded letters. Obviously the day of writing the reply is often noted as the date for reply, while the letters themselves bear the date of despatch. Hence, such difference may also occur in letters to be inferred and should be taken into account. —A certain letter is mentioned in the subsequent letter (like "In your last letter of 5th May . . ."). In this case, the date of the letter is assured. —The same case, but vaguer indication (like "Your criticism of my recent novel has deeply affected me"). If there is no record of a letter with such criticism, it may be inferred. Usually, unless there are other criteria relating to the contents, the date can only be established as terminus ante quem, i.e. the fact that this letter must have been written prior to the one containing the reply. In favourable conditions a terminus post quem can be given as well; for instance the time when the writer received the said novel as regards our example. —The same case, but an even vaguer indication (like "When I last wrote you about two years ago . . ."). Here only a very vague date can be given, such as "approximately in the summer of 1781". —If letters by the author concerned are concretely mentioned, paraphrased or quoted in letters from second persons to third persons. The date may be mentioned but may also be determined as terminus ante quem or as a vague indication. Particularly in the case of uncertain indications ("about two years ago") it is important and indispensable to know exactly both the author's working method and his general behaviour in order to really infer a letter. As soon as an author is suspected to mention an alleged letter only to justify his long silence no letter should be inferred. However, the disputable fact has to be explained in the annotations to the passage concerned. (We encounter such cases for instance for Bertolt Brecht but also for other authors.) On the other hand, letters should never be inferred in the following uncertain circumstances: —When the author writes that he will write a letter to a certain person tomorrow, soon, etc. If there is no record of the actual implementation of this plan a letter should not be inferred. —When a postal item (a parcel, manuscripts sent, etc.) was not necessarily accompanied by a letter (as in "Thank you for the manuscripts for my newspaper"). If there is no other evidence for a letter or if such evidence were not necessary because of the intimate relationship between the two persons, a letter should not be inferred. —When the letter-writer, without mentioning a letter, refers to information from among the addressee's acquaintances which he may have gained by oral statements by a visitor, a friend, etc. and which thus do not necessarily presuppose a message sent as a letter. —If letters had to be inferred from the mere potential sequence of letters exchanged between two correspondents. In such a case it cannot be definitely ascertained whether it should be supposed that there was no letter, one letter, or even several letters, because even in a continuous correspondence one cannot presuppose that letters were always alternating. In all these cases, the possibility of the existence of a letter which cannot be proved definitely should be indicated, if necessary, only in the annotations to the letter on hand. In connection with the inference of letters we have come across the problem of the truth contained in statements in letters. A separate study would be necessary to make a thorough inquiry into this important subject. What I want to do here in closing is warn against using the record of a letter alone as evidence for the truth of a given statement, because the writer of a letter gives his opinions always subjectively from his own view of things and often does not strive for objectivity. On the other hand, he normally adapts himself to the addressee of his letter, taking account of the latter's potential sensitive points, state of tension with certain people, aesthetic, moral and political conceptions, and filtering his statements accordingly. Where quotations from letters (or from autobiographical writings) are used to prove a fact, not only the writer of this text but also the addressee should be taken into consideration. The truth of a statement can be proved with a degree of certainty not until a similar statement is found in letters to other persons or additionally substantiated by other evidence. To cite one example: Georg Forster's statements about Goethe in his letters to Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi are always cautious and critical. If we only had these commentaries on Goethe by Forster and did not know that in those years Jacobi was at enmity with Goethe (for which Forster showed consideration in his letters to him), we would get a wrong impression of Forster's attitude towards Goethe. Our judgment is clarified as soon as we refer to Forster's statements about Goethe in letters to other persons, thus receiving diversified information on Forster's attitude. Since the presence or absence of letters (and thus, the judgements contained in them) is always dependent on chance, the user of a letter edition should use all those records with a pinch of salt, and critically. Important as information and opinions contained in letters may be, they are never objective reflections of real facts and must not be regarded as such. The editor should raise doubts as to the credibility of a statement in the annotations and, if necessary, point to different remarks which were made to another correspondent and qualify certain statements. However, he should not allow his edition to become an omniumgatherum of contradictory statements by various persons but should rely on the knowledge and ability to differentiate in the users of his edition.

      <field name="heading_text">Editing the Correspondence of Charles Darwin by Frederick Burkhardt *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What i should like to offer on this occasion is an account of the editing of Darwin's correspondence as a venture in applying principles and methods of textual editing to historical documents—in this case, letters— that for the most part were never intended for publication. When the Darwin Correspondence project began, the members of our editorial staff were entirely innocent of any knowledge of the techniques which had been so well developed in literary editing. Their training had been in science or the history of science and they had the typically relaxed and loosely formulated attitude of most non-literary scholars to the texts they were handling, that is to say, their habits and training focussed mainly upon providing the texts, more or less as they found them, with sound explanatory footnotes. At that time, as General Editor of The Works of William James , of which Professor Bowers was Textual Editor, I became acquainted with his work and became convinced that his editing philosophy and techniques should be applied to the Darwin correspondence and I set out to convert my colleagues to the new editorial policy. In accomplishing this, I was powerfully assisted by an advance copy of G. Thomas Tanselle's paper on "The Editing of Historical Documents." 1 That article more than anything else persuaded them of the soundness and indeed the necessity of treating our material according to the standards of modern textual practice. With Professor Bowers' help we then set about writing a style manual for our edition. I should perhaps emphasize that he has no responsibility for any of the shortcomings of our work. Although his paper on the "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants" 2 was our Bible, there is no reason to assume that it was immune to the fate of any bible in the hands of its disciples. Before describing the specific practices and problems we have encountered in our editing, it will be helpful to set down the kinds of documents that constitute the raw materials of the Darwin correspondence: 1. Original manuscripts, mainly holographs on both sides of the correspondence, constitute by far the greatest number of letters. Of the more than 14,000 that have so far been located, roughly 5,000 Darwin letters and 4,000 letters to Darwin are located in the Darwin Archive at Cambridge University. The rest are located in over 200 widely scattered libraries and private collections. 2. Photocopies of about 5,000 letters have been obtained from repositories in some 20 countries. Transcriptions made from these are checked by the editors against the originals, insofar as this is practicable. Most of them are located in readily accessible collections, the largest among them being in about a dozen libraries, including the American Philosophical Society Library, The British Library, and The Royal Society. 3. Manuscript copies made for Francis Darwin when he was preparing his editions of his father's life and letters. The originals were borrowed from the recipients and most have been preserved and located, but a substantial number of the copies are the only versions we have to work with. 4. Published letters form a fourth category. Some of these were intended for publication by Darwin, others are printed mainly in the biographies of contemporaries. Again, in many cases, the originals have been lost. 5. In the Darwin Archive there are several hundred drafts of letters in Darwin's hand. In many cases, the final version has not been found. 6. Memoranda. These are communications from Darwin correspondents containing information about subjects in which he was interested, often sent in response to his queries. These are not in epistolary form, though usually signed. 7. So-called "third-party" letters. These are letters forwarded to Darwin because he had made some request of a recipient acting as an intermediary, or because they contained information about subjects in which he was known to be interested. 8. Letters known only from entries in bookseller and auction catalogues. These range from full facsimile reproductions to paraphrases and summaries. Even from this bare list it is obvious that a proportion of the material available does not lend itself to the preparation of texts that can make a claim to being definitive in the sense that they represent Darwin's final intentions. This is difficult enough with holographs or photocopy versions. When all that is available is a draft, or a published or handwritten copy over which Darwin had no control, the level of editorial intervention and conjecture inevitably rises. With summaries in sales catalogues there is nothing to do but to reproduce them as they are printed, except when there is evidence from other sources that the date, the name of the recipient, or errors of transcription can be supplied or corrected. Before discussing the editing of the holograph letters, which, I am glad to report, form at least 90 per cent of the material at hand, some brief remarks about how we are handling the more refractory kinds of textual material may be of interest. Of these, the texts closest to what Darwin finally wrote are, one may assume, his drafts. These provide some of the most troublesome problems of transcription, not only because they are even more difficult to decipher than his normal handwriting, but because the alterations frequently consist of deletions and interlineations within interlineations containing still other alterations. When the substance and sequence of what Darwin was striving for have been established to an editor's satisfaction, there is the additional problem of rendering the alteration note in a form that will be intelligible. In our computerized typesetting program we originally devised a set of codes for the different types of alterations which enabled the computer to extract and print out an alteration automatically. The codes worked well for simple deletions and interlineations, but when we applied them to more complicated nests of alterations what came out was hopeless gibberish. Although it is no doubt theoretically possible to solve this problem, we became convinced that the note produced would be so complex that the liability to error in production and proofreading would be too great to risk. We have therefore, as a result of this problem, and also because the number of codes needed to deal with all the varieties of alteration became very large, given up on coding for automatic reproduction. We now write the notes out manually, using the system Professor Bowers has employed for The Works of William James . The dependability of the substantive content of Darwin's drafts can sometimes be inferred from surrounding letters to and from his correspondents, but of course in any strict sense, the text Darwin actually sent off in the mail cannot be reconstructed. In some cases it is not even known that a final version was posted. We have nevertheless included all drafts in our edition because of their relationship to his work and his other correspondence. From this one may infer, correctly, that we have adopted a very broad definition in what we consider to be correspondence. The next closest to authentic Darwin texts are the copies of his letters made for Francis Darwin. The copyists he employed were clearly instructed to make completely literal transcriptions of the originals. The first difficulty in editing them arises from the fact that errors in reading Darwin's handwriting were bound to occur in the copies. When Francis corrected them one can usually trust his revision because, having served for years as his father's assistant and secretary, he knew his hand better than anyone else. But the problem is complicated by the fact that, in letters that he decided to publish, Francis modernized the spelling and punctuation of the originals to conform to his or the publisher's style. In such cases the editor can usually retain the copyist's renderings if they conform to Darwin's habits, such as his use of the ampersand or when there is independent evidence from another letter or document that the "corrected" version has departed from what Darwin wrote. There are, as well, instances when both Francis and the copyist were wrong, as for example when both refer to a 'Dr. Hanley', whereas from another letter, and independent research, we can be reasonably sure that the correct name is 'Hawley'. On the whole, however, I believe we can claim that the texts we have reconstructed from the copies have a fairly high degree of reliability in both substantives and accidentals. Letters that exist, so far as we know, only in published form present similar problems. For the most part it is necessary to accept the printed version of the text, but sometimes there is solid evidence from an independent source for changing it. This is the case when obvious misreadings of Darwin's handwriting can be identified from other letters on the same subject, or from other material in the Darwin Archive. For example, in one letter the printer made nonsense of a sentence by reading 'Oracle' when Darwin wrote 'Orache' (a species of weed). Some of the published letters were written by Darwin for publication in periodicals like Gardeners' Chronicle and Nature . With these, our first problem was to decide whether to include them at all in our edition, since many of them might well be considered short informal articles or reports of research despite their epistolary form. In the end we decided to include them because many of them elicited responses, and printing them provided background and context for such related letters. Another case in which the problem is not so much one of editing the text, but whether it should be included in the edition, arises in the case of memoranda sent to Darwin by some of his correspondents. Some memoranda are signed and can with good reason be considered letters that simply lack a salutation and valedictory. Many of them were almost certainly enclosures in letters that were not preserved. Other documents of this kind have the epistolary form but have every aspect of being memoranda in that their content consists almost exclusively of lists of various kinds of data. In the end we gave up trying to be consistent. We have omitted some memoranda because we think that they can be adequately handled by the printed summaries in our Calendar of the correspondence. Others have been included because of the extensive use Darwin made of them. But this practice has now raised a serious problem of space in the case of the letters and memoranda from one of Darwin's most important correspondents, Edward Blyth. Some of these are over 20 folio pages long, full of information on the natural history of India. Some have several pages of notes by Darwin pinned to them. In the year 1855, the correspondence of which I have just been editing, the ten letters and memoranda of the Blyth correspondence total over 150 manuscript pages. As a practical matter, including them makes a serious problem for the length of the volume as well as being a burden to the general reader. We have not yet decided how much to include, nor on what criterion to base the decision. An appendix for the memoranda, using small type, may be an answer. But whatever is decided, if they are omitted from the edition, the full texts of the memoranda will be edited and put on the magnetic tapes that are now being prepared of the entire correspondence with a grant from the Mellon Foundation. Memoranda are only a small part of the correspondence Darwin received and preserved during the 61 years to be covered by the edition. In the early years he saved in their entirety mainly family letters and those from scientists like John Stevens Henslow and Joseph Dalton Hooker, who were close friends. From the letters of others it was his practice to cut out those portions that he thought important for his work in progress, and to file them in portfolios of notes according to their subject matter. After the publication of the Origin he saved a large proportion of the letters he received without making excerpts, discarding only the envelopes. The letters to Darwin are being edited in their final form—that is, without recording alterations, but the spelling and punctuation of the originals have been retained. The editorial problems of this portion of the correspondence are mainly concerned with recording the annotations Darwin made on them. These consist of marginal scoring, underlining, and comments, which are usually brief but sometimes run to several pages. Determining the precise location and extent of the texts to which annotations apply is often a matter of editorial judgment. The annotations, which are transcribed as exactly as possible, are recorded immediately following the texts of the letters. Each comment is located by paragraph and line number, and any alteration Darwin made in writing them has been recorded in formulaic style according to the Bowers system. In this system the final version is printed, and the alterations made in the original version are put in brackets at the places in which they occur. For example an entry that reads: 6.1 See Daubeny ['vol. 1' del ] for *description of volcanoes in [ interl ] South America 6.3 ink means that Darwin noted in ink, in the margin of paragraph six of the letter, between lines 1 and 3, 'See Daubeny vol. 1 for South America' and then deleted 'vol. 1' and inserted 'description of volcanoes in' after 'for'. The asterisk before 'description' marks the beginning of the interlined phrase, which ends at the bracket. Since the vast majority of interlineations are of single words, we have used the asterisk only when more than one word is affected in order to reduce the number of insertions of this intrusive symbol. The final text of Darwin's comment can be read by simply skipping the bracketed material. The "third-party" letters provide no special editing problem other than the decision to include or exclude them. For the period before the publication of the Origin it has been possible to include almost every extant communication to or from Darwin, including the third-party letters that were not intended to be sent to him in the first place. After 1860, however, the volume of correspondence that has been preserved is so great that some selection will have to be made. But all the omitted letters will be transcribed and edited for the magnetic tape record. The Darwin manuscript letters consist of two kinds. The majority are holograph letters, but some are written in the hand of an amanuensis and signed by Darwin, often with emendations or postscripts in his own hand. When the writer can be identified—as is the case with those written by his wife, or his son Francis—this is noted. Since these letters bear his signature, they have been transcribed literally, even though some of the spelling and punctuation is not in Darwin's usual form. Under the circumstances, cases in which an editorial intervention can be justified are rare. The holograph letters pose several difficult and time-consuming problems that are not strictly concerned with establishing the text. Darwin seldom dated his letters fully, contenting himself with a minimal '11th' or 'Monday'. Nor did he generally identify addressees by name unless they were members of the family or intimate friends such as Lyell, Hooker, and Huxley. After envelopes were adopted, they were not usually preserved with the letters. As a result the identity of the recipients of a great many letters must be established from their content, from surrounding correspondence, or from other sources. In establishing the text the major problem is Darwin's difficult handwriting. To decide what he actually wrote, it is frequently necessary to consider his intent from the context, from related letters, or, often, from independent sources. For example, in a letter to Richard Owen, Darwin says he is enclosing a pamphlet on scarlet fever. Gavin de Beer in his transcription made this out to be 'scarlet ferns'. The original seemed to us to be, fairly certainly, 'fever', but it was the knowledge that there actually was a pamphlet on that subject, sent to him by another correspondent, that established the reading beyond doubt. We have had to make decisions of this kind in literally hundreds of cases. Even when Darwin's general intent is clear, there are instances when alternative readings are possible. To take a familiar example, when Darwin clearly intended to write 'ever' but the word looks more like 'even' it is nevertheless correct to transcribe it as 'ever'. But in some cases it is possible that two similar words are equally plausible renderings of what is written. In such cases the rendering adopted is indicated as conjectural with the alternative recorded in the apparatus. For our edition we decided to print in "clear" or "reading" text, in which the alterations are recorded in a separate apparatus from which the original form of the text can be reconstructed. This decision was made because the readers interested in Darwin are varied in background and interests and we wanted to produce an edition for both a general and a scholarly audience. To some extent, this decision made editing the text even more complex, because it necessitated coming to a decision about what could be left in our transcription and still have it a reading text, and what could be removed to the apparatus while preserving the quality and characteristics as well as the authorial integrity of the text as Darwin had left it. With some exceptions to be noted and justified below, we have retained Darwin's spelling and punctuation. As Frank Sulloway has demonstrated, the Darwin correspondence provides very convincing evidence of the importance of preserving the spelling. 3 For instance, during the voyage of the Beagle , some documents can be dated as early or late in the voyage because Darwin changed his spelling of certain words. At one point, probably after reading some of the early voyages of exploration, he suddenly began to spell 'Pacific' with a final 'k'. This furnished part of the evidence that he first arrived at his theory of coral reef formation while he was still in South America, before he had seen any such reefs. Other spellings were changed late in the voyage after he bought a dictionary at Cape Town. Still others, like 'neighbourhead' and 'thoroughily' occur in the correspondence as late as the 1850s. In our edition, some misspellings have been preserved, even when it is clear that they are unintentional, as in 'lawer' or 'reollect, because such errors sometimes indicate haste, excitement, or, in a series of letters, a habit of carelessness in writing to a particular correspondent or on a particular subject. In deciding whether to keep such unintended misspellings in the text, or to correct them silently with a record of the original in the apparatus, the editors have used their judgment as to whether they were of some possible significance. If they are considered innocuous slips, they are corrected and a record of the correction is made in the alterations apparatus. Similar discretion has been exercised in distinguishing between "mendings" and "alterations" as when an 'h' is touched up to make it clearly into a 'k'. Capital letters have been transcribed as they occur except in certain cases, like 'c' and 'm', which are frequently written somewhat larger than normal in the initial letters of words. In these cases, Darwin's, or the writer's, normal practice is followed. Since Darwin frequently capitalized nouns there is sometimes doubt as to his intention in the case of 'C' and 'M'. The capital is then retained. Darwin occasionally wrote an 'a' in a word so that it looks more like an 'e'. Usually this can be treated as a result of haste and corrected silently, but there are cases in which we know the 'e' is part of a misspelled word, as in 'seperate', which occurs often and consistently. Sometimes it is not possible to make a decision based on normal use when the word in question is an unusual one like a species name, or one which occurs very rarely. A recent instance of the latter occurred in transcribing 'Birmingham', in which it was necessary to decide whether the first vowel was an 'e' or an undotted 'i'. In such cases it seems reasonable to give Darwin the benefit of the doubt. In some instances, that are not misspellings in a strict sense, editorial corrections have been made silently. Darwin consistently wrote 'bl' so that it looks like 'lb' as in 'albe' for 'able', or 'troulbe' for 'trouble'. Because this occurs so consistently in different words, the editors consider that it is most unlikely to be misspelling but rather a peculiarity of handwriting, perhaps related to a form of dyslexia. Consequently such words are transcribed as normally written without any alteration being recorded, though the reversal has been signalled in the Note on Editorial Method. Similar treatment has been given to Darwin's habitual slurring in writing 'vey' or 'vy' for 'very', and 'ing' endings as 'ng'. Elsewhere, however, there are words that contain a misformed letter that could affect the meaning. This happens when Darwin has crossed an 'l' so that it looks like a 't'. Usually it is obvious that the letter is intended to be 'l', as in 'stippers' and 'istand'; such non-words have been transcribed with an 'l'. But because it is possible that a 't' could be misinterpreted as a crossed 'l', as for instance in 'meat', all such cases have been recorded in an alteration note. Knowledge of this tendency is sometimes helpful in considering whether a copyist has transcribed a crossed 'l' as a 't'; for instance the proper name 'Staney' in a letter would almost certainly have been intended to be 'Slaney', the family name of Shrewsbury friends. Our most exasperating problems have been concerned with transcribing Darwin's idiosyncratic punctuation. In his early letters Darwin sprinkled his sentences with points, some of which could be intended as periods or full-stops, even though no capital letter follows them. Others can serve grammatically as commas, and, since in Darwin's day commas were used more frequently than now, we have so interpreted many of them in our transcriptions. Some turned out to be bleeds from the versos of the manuscript leaves. But after accounting for as many as we could in some rational way, there were many for which no grammatical function could be conjectured. These have been omitted, with the omissions recorded in the alterations apparatus. Some additional examples will give some notion of punctuation about which decisions had to be made: Inverted question marks, possibly a vestige of his South American days, are not infrequent in the early letters; occasionally commas and semi-colons are reversed; sometimes colons and semi-colons are used where we would use commas; an "equal" sign occasionally serves as a hyphen; semi-colons and other punctuation marks sometimes occur directly under question marks. Commas, well-formed and seemingly deliberate, sometimes occur in places where they serve no purpose. Dashes of varying lengths sometimes serve as periods, and, more often, follow them as well. Sometimes, when they are longer than usual and are followed by a space somewhat longer than usual, and there is a change of subject, this combination can reasonably be taken as a sign indicating a new paragraph. We have dealt with these various idiosyncratic usages by leaving as many in the text as we could without appearing foolish or pedantic, and consigning the rest to the apparatus where being foolish or pedantic does little harm. In lengthy letters of the 1830s, new paragraphs have usually been inserted whenever the subject changes, because it seems reasonable to assume that, before the penny post, space was precious and paragraphing was a wasteful habit. It is, I believe, a common phenomenon that editors working together on complex projects find that they rarely disagree on matters of substance but that the decisions that generate heated differences usually involve punctuation and spelling. This has certainly been the case with the editorial staff of the Darwin Correspondence project. Most of our differences now seem trivial, but one of them may be of some interest. It arose early in our project when we discovered that in Darwin's well-known sentence 'I look at a strong tendency to generalize as an entire evil', the manuscript clearly and unambiguously read 'generatize'. The issue was whether this was a neologism Darwin had invented to describe naturalists who created new species and genera in order to have their names affixed to them as their discoverers. Darwin despised such "species-mongers," and the context, though not strongly supportive, gave some reason to think Darwin might indeed have intended 'generatize'. But we later found so many cases of crossed 'l's, in 'stippers', 'istand', 'capilat' and the like, while no other use of 'generatize' was ever found, that only one editor held out for the neologism. Peace was established by changing the text to 'generalize' and noting the possibility of 'generatize' in a footnote. To commemorate the controversy, one of our editors has named his kitten 'Stippers'. I could cite many other cases that were difficult to settle, but I believe I have produced enough to show the general nature of the problems involved in transcribing and editing Darwin's letters. If we had adopted the straight descriptive or formulaic system in editing, we might have avoided some of the problems, but the resulting text would be extremely burdensome to any but the most dedicated scholars. Using the clear-text system enabled us to preserve to a substantial degree the character and quality of the original, and provided an apparatus that made possible a reconstruction of the changes Darwin made in producing his final version. But the clear-text system also increases the number of problems that have to be solved about authorial intent in deciding what is to be left in the text and what for one reason or another can be put into the apparatus. With the formulaic system, intent must sometimes be considered in deciphering what Darwin wrote, but everything else that he wrote can be kept as it is whether Darwin intended it or not and it is left to the reader to make what he can of the text. With the clear-text system the editor takes on this task for the reader, and thereby increases the risk that subjective and arbitrary interpretations will creep in. In consequence, a clear-text edition of manuscripts like the Darwin letters is close to being a critical edition insofar as the reading text contains corrections made by the editors of Darwin's aberrations and errors. In our editing of the correspondence the general adoption of the Bowers principles and system of transcription provided a uniform and consistent style manual for the editors and proofreading staff. We found no text that could not be transcribed by using it, though we have not yet succeeded in teaching the computer to master it. Most importantly, applying it has demonstrated to us that it has important substantive consequences in faithfully reproducing Darwin's trains of thought, his associative processes, his struggle for clarity of expression, and many other aspects of his writing habits that help us better to understand his mind at work.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Practice, not Theory: Editing J. S. Mill's Newspaper Writings by John M. Robson *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction Recalling his father's educational practice (and theory), John Stuart Mill says: "I recollect . . . his indignation at my using the common expression that something was true in theory but required correction in practice; and how, after making me vainly stive to define the word theory, he explained its meaning, and shewed the fallacy of the vulgar form of speech which I had used; leaving me fully persuaded that in being unable to give a correct definition of Theory, and in speaking of it as something that might be at variance with practice, I had shewn unparalleled ignorance." 1 This lesson was administered in Mill's twelfth or thirteenth year, and, despite his general acceptance of James Mill's authority, he continued to tease out its implications for the rest of his life: it might be said, for example, that his great System of Logic is an extended analysis of theory and practice. And how comforting it would be to say that he resolved the problem, for which of us is not more at ease—in Zion and elsewhere— if our practice can be shown to fit into a sweet theoretical niche. So, in editing Mill's works, from the beginning and it seems forever, we have sought that comfort. But it was and is not to be ours, as the following discussion will demonstrate, and I hope justify. Mill properly qualifies as a polymath, and therefore presents special challenges to editors, not least because his works are of special concern to people of very different interests. 2 He also, if one may be forgiven the word, is polygeneric, and therefore produces even more editorial problems. Mill's longest works went through many revised editions, as did, with fewer changes, his shorter monographs. Even in these apparently benign cases, decisions about the proper treatment of lightly revised texts may be less than ideal for heavily revised ones. His major periodical essays were published in a collection that went from two to three volumes in his lifetime, and to four volumes posthumously; the revisions of these essays vary in scope and kind, almost as much as in subject matter, and there are manuscript texts for only two of them. Most of his essays, however, were not republished and, apart from those portions of some of them that were used in other works, have single versions. Furthermore, he wrote (and kept a record of) over 1700 despatches for the East India Company during his twenty-five years in the Examiner's Office; these are anomalous with any other of his writings, and there is no carefully thought-out guide to editing such materials. And, not to labour the matter, there are, of course, private and public letters, a few journals, and many speeches (debating, public, and parliamentary), all of which might be thought to call for special treatment. Finally, there are comparatively few manuscripts of any kind, except, of course, for the material he did not himself publish, such as letters, journals, and the India Office despatches (a few of which were printed in Blue Books). The mix is not as before—or ever again. The mode moderne , however, calls for at least an appearance of consistency in bringing together a writer's works into a single edition, and so we in the Collected Works of J. S. Mill (twenty-five to date, with five more to come) have adopted principles and methods that we have applied as closely as seemed practicable and wise for each title. 3 Saving the newspaper writings for a late stage tested our will and our skill in ways that we did and did not foresee. In the four volumes those writings occupy, we have included everything of Mill's that appeared in a daily or weekly newspaper, with minor exceptions mentioned below. The articles span more than fifty years, from 1822 when Mill was sixteen years old, until 1873, the year of his death; the subjects range from abstract economics (with which he began) and practical economics (with which he ended), through French and British politics, reviews of music and theatre, Irish land reform, to domestic cruelty, with glances at what seems like everything else lit by the nineteenth-century sun or obscured by its fog. Not questioning the importance of including these items in the Collected Works —though in some ways a heretic, as will become evident, I am not seeking martyrdom by preaching such a dangerous doctrine anywhere, let alone in the holy land—I still can admit that individually they are comparatively unimportant. Mill did not reprint them (again with minor exceptions to be mentioned below), undoubtedly judging them to fall within the area of proscription he defines in his own collection of essays, Dissertations and Discussions . Those excluded from the volumes, he says, "were either of too little value at any time, or what value they might have was too exclusively temporary, or the thoughts they contained were inextricably mixed up with comments, now totally uninteresting, on passing events, or on some book not generally known; or lastly, any utility they may have possessed has since been superseded by other and more mature writings of the author." 4 While recognizing Mill's wisdom in many matters, we are not disposed to heed him here. At the very least, the bulk of these materials gives them very considerable significance. There was, of course, a recognition in Mill's time by people as diverse as Newman, Carlyle, Bulwer-Lytton and Disraeli, that newspapers were becoming extremely important in determining public opinion, and that the determination of public opinion was increasing in importance with the growing power of democracy. Let me cite only Disraeli: "Opinion is now supreme, and Opinion speaks in print. The representation of the Press is far more complete than the representation of Parliament." 5 The campaign against the "taxes on knowledge" gained much of its force from the general belief that the "people" needed the information, political, scientific, economic, artistic, and so on, that could most easily and quickly be transmitted through the daily and weekly press. Indeed, from the sixteenth century to the present, one abiding belief has been the importance to civility and utility of freedom of access through the press to opinions and facts of all kinds. The great campaigns of the nineteenth century used the press effectively and constantly, and though newspapers' significance for scholars of many persuasions has come to be recognized only in the last quarter century, there has been since then an ever-increasing use of newspapers as historical sources for opinion as well as fact. That Mill was as aware as anyone else in his time of the surge of importance and interest is demonstrated by his heavy participation in what could not fancifully be called the "newspaper movement." 6 Indeed, he identified his times as "this age of newspapers." 7 Not all is well in such an age (it is also an "age of transition" to something better), as Mill makes clear in several places. For example, praising his friend W. B. Adams ("Junius Redivivus"), he comments that, in the circumstances, "all he has written, perhaps all he will ever have the inclination or patience to write, will be ephemeral. . . ." 8 More vividly: "The Spartan in the story, who, for the crime of using two words where one would have sufficed, was sentenced to read from beginning to end the history of Guicciardini, and at the end of a few pages begged to commute his punishment for the galleys, would have prayed to exchange it for death if he had been condemned to read a file of English newspapers five years old." 9 Nonetheless, especially in his early years he thought the times were ripe for the kind of education in and stimulation of reform that he could encourage through the ephemeral press. The anonymity it provided gave him the opportunity, so often seized in British life, for authoritative judgments in a favourable context: that is, the authority for the judgments was attached to the newspaper itself, and the principal readers of any newspaper then were those who accepted its general political orientation. Mill was frequently, it should be mentioned, a member of a dedicated team: his leading articles and news reports, for instance, reflect his often intimate connections with the editors, particularly in the 1820s with John Black of the Morning Chronicle and in the 1830s with Albany Fonblanque of the Examiner . And his reviews are not seldom imbued with enthusiasm for his allies' endeavours. Although Mill's later journalism, while still polemical, in general shows more care in developing an authority based on argument than on statement (partly, one may guess, because the anonymity was less guarded, or even absent, because the tone of the newspapers in which he was writing had altered, and because he was both more skilful and more committed to a balanced tone), his opinions then gained from the increased prestige of the big dailies with large circulation. In any case, malgré their ephemerality, newspapers provided Mill early and late with a platform he considered worth mounting, as the bulk of our volumes will all too readily testify.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Description of materials In the volumes will be found 427 items, from 27 newspapers, 17 of them daily, and 10 weekly; however, the greater number, 261, appeared in weeklies, the loading factor being Mill's dedication to the weekly Examiner , especially from 1830 through 1834, resulting in 235 contributions over his lifetime. In fact, after Mill's first few years of writing for newspapers (much of it consisting of letters to the editor of the Morning Chronicle , many of which were probably solicited, or at least guaranteed a place), contributions to weeklies dominate the record through the 1830s, Mill's busiest period as a journalist. Subsequently his contributions to dailies are more common, with leading articles for the Morning Chronicle (in which 114 items appeared) and a variety of letters to editors making up the bulk. In addition to the Examiner , the weeklies (in order of the frequency of Mill's contributions; and where these are equal in number, in the order of date of those contributions) include the Spectator (12 times), the Black Dwarf (4), the Sunday Times (2), the Leader (2), the Republican (1), the Lancet (1), the Reasoner (1), the Weekly Despatch (1), and the Reader (1); the dailies, after the Morning Chronicle , are the Daily News (16), the Globe and Traveller (11), The Times (8), the Sun (2), the News Times (1), the British Traveller (1), Le Globe (1), Le National (1), the True Sun (1), the Guide (1), La Voix des Femmes (1), the Morning Post (1), the Penny Newsman (1), Our Daily Fare (1), and the New York Tribune (1). 10 The distribution over time is important: 42 of the items appeared in the 1820s, 246 in the 1830s, 99 in the 1840s, 20 in the 1850s, 11 in the 1860s, and 9 in the 1870s. Equally significant is the distribution of types: 182 are leading articles, 106 news reports, 72 letters, 47 reviews, 6 obituaries, and 14 miscellaneous articles. 11 Just why I call these important and significant cannot here be explicated, though I trust the reasons for the judgment will be obvious; I should emphasize merely that I am thinking not only of analysis of Mill's career and thought, but also of editing practices. Simply referring to the contents of the volumes as "newspaper writings" disguises some problems. I said above that we have included all of Mill's writings that appeared in a daily or weekly newspaper, with some exceptions. This definition needs refinement in several ways. First, the volumes are part of a collected edition, and have been published towards the end of that edition. When Francis Mineka was preparing Mill's correspondence, he (following Mill) made a distinction that seemed perfectly appropriate at the time, and still has general validity, between "private" and "public" letters, the basis being the intended audience. He excluded "public" letters from his volumes, leaving them for later consideration. We decided to include them here, for all but three of them were designed for newspapers, though not all of them appeared. 12 This decision is based on our unwillingness to leave a few letters, more closely related in genre and form to what is in these volumes, for a miscellaneous volume that will be heterogenous enough without them. Similarly, we included those letters to the editor that failed to be published, because, though some of them are obviously drafts, they were intended for newspaper publication, and almost certainly were sent in fair copy. Another problem arises with articles or parts of articles that were reprinted in newspapers from other of Mill's writings. If one sees these volumes as gathering together the total materials that revealed Mill to newspaper readers, it must be regretted that some very telling pieces are excluded as extracted reprints. But actually no one reader would have been able to see Mill the journalist whole, for most of his writings were anonymous, and they were scattered over such a period of time and so many papers that the likelihood of anyone reading them all is so small as to be negligible. Furthermore, we cannot pretend that we have found all examples of such reprints: the newspapers of the day commonly made extracts of this kind (often with the intention of puffing), and Mill was a popular author. We collated those found with the copy-texts used in other volumes of our edition, though there is no evidence that Mill had anything to do with the text of the reprints; we have found nothing of textual value. Finally, we were reluctant to reprint anything that appears elsewhere in the Collected Works , even though it could be argued that some items should have been saved for these volumes. In particular, and with great reluctance, we excluded letters already published in our volumes of correspondence, often in draft form; according to received theory, these manuscript versions have the greater authority (at least as to accidentals), but the printed versions have greater polish, suggesting a Millian finishing. This criterion has been put aside in a few cases: for instance, Mill used some of his leading articles on agriculture in an appendix to his Principles of Political Economy ; these were collated for the text of the Principles , and the substantive variants are given there. But it seems appropriate to give the original versions in the Newspaper Writings , because they are part of a series, not all of which was used in the Principles , and because the rewriting altered the form of the argument, if not markedly its substance. And we reprinted two other items, Mill's obituary of Jeremy Bentham (1832) and a petition for free trade (1844), believing that we were mistaken in including them in appendices to earlier volumes, where they lose part of their appropriate contexts. These cases of exclusion and inclusion are, it will be seen, special to our situation. Also special is the confidence with which we can identify these items as Mill's. How many of them could we have been able to call his were it not for the survival of a copy of the list he kept of his published writings? 13 Alexander Bain, Mill's closest disciple, whose detailed knowledge is shown in his slight but informative biography, 14 using the information in Mill's Autobiography , some now unrecoverable family memories, as well as his practised judgment, was able to identify the larger proportion of Mill's early writings in monthlies and quarterlies, but could do little to pin down his newspaper writings. Similarly, F. A. Hayek, to whom is attributable the revival of interest in Mill after World War II, and who had a good eye for Mill's work, dismissed the series, "The Prospects of France," signed "S," one of Mill's common identifications, as not being in his style, and failed to find another signalled by a reference in one of Mill's letters. 15 The surviving private correspondence would lead with considerable certainty to a few items, and some others (especially letters to the editor in the latter part of his life) are signed either with his name or with initials or pseudonyms that—provided one somehow came across the items—would permit identification. But I much doubt whether we would have found more than 25% without his surer guidance. Confirmation of the list, so far as the important early writings in the Examiner are concerned, is found in a bound set of that newspaper in the collection of books from Mill's library housed in Somerville College, Oxford. 16 On the front flyleaves of all but the 1830 volume Mill listed his own articles, and (for the volumes for 1831-33) enclosed the parts of the text by him in inked square brackets. Also he made some corrections in ink. For the most part these three sets of information confirm the other, independent list, but the Somerville material enabled us to add some items to Mill's corpus. Other evidence, such as the correspondence, signatures, and internal connections with identified items, enabled us to add a few more. Also, Mill's list included only published writings; we have, as mentioned above, included the meagre number of unpublished letters intended for newspapers that remain in manuscript. We have scanned the likely sources for further items, especially for the years after 1865, because Mill's list contains a very disturbing if excusable note: "From this time [presumably after April 1865, the date of publication of the preceding item] no memorandum has been made of my letters which have appeared in print: numbers of my public or private letters having found their way into newspapers, of all of which (I believe) the original drafts have been retained in my possession." 17 In total, we added only 27 items to Mill's list: 10 of these (mostly in Mill's later years) have signatures; 7 come from the Somerville College Examiner ; 5 are unpublished holographs; 3 are identified by external evidence and 1 by internal; and 1 is an ambiguous entry in MacMinn's edition. 18 Therefore, while we are pleased to have added any to Mill's list, it remains the vital source. With all our experience, we should have greatly underestimated and underrepresented his journalism without it; it is, we say with full understanding of the implications, impossible to search carefully through the files of nineteenth-century British newspapers to find Mill's writings. We envy, as all editors must, the reliance of Dickens' scholars on the devoted and loving efforts of myriads of readers over the past century who have found, by accident as well as design, the trails of Dickens in tangled banks of Darwinian complexity—but Mill was not Dickens, and Mill scholars, avid as they are, do not have the devotion of Dickensians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Treatment 1. Organization Though the general principle governing the division of materials amongst the volumes of the Collected Works is thematic, there are strong generic marks that make the universal application of such a rule ridiculous: for the special purposes of anthologies it is sensible to isolate parts of Mill's System of Logic , for instance, but to dissect that tome and store its bits in bottles labelled "the syllogism," "abstract method," "ethics," "political theory," etc., would be quite irresponsible. So the rule has been applied only to materials, usually periodical essays and short monographs, that are of a length permitting combination within thematic volumes. Within these volumes, a chronological order is followed, although sub-themes could have been used to combine essays. In the Earlier and Later Letters chronology was followed without much hesitation, for the other main option, grouping by correspondent, is of value only when there is a large mass of letters and when both sides of correspondences are substantial; neither of these conditions is sufficiently filled in Mill's case. I mention these obvious matters only to explain the background to our decision to organize the newspaper writings (and also the journals and speeches that will make up Volumes XXVI-XXVIII) in chronological order. Materials as heterogenous as these generally resist division into themes or subjects, though in Mill's case the newspaper writings provide, as indicated above, two major subjects: French politics in the early 1830s and Irish land in the late 1840s. However, so densely grouped chronologically are these two sets that they cohere even within an ordering by date. Furthermore, some other groupings would be objectionably arbitrary, and there would be a ragtail remnant. This decision makes it difficult to break the material into coherent units that would serve as "chapters." Since few users of the volumes will read them through from beginning to end, in fact these aids to ease are not essential; nonetheless we introduced breaks into timely intervals that will at least allow the table of contents to be followed without strain; and indeed because of the relation of Mill's journalism to patterns in his life and to external events these "chapters" actually have thematic and sub-generic affinities that are explored in the Introduction. For each item we provide a title, a headnote, the text, and footnotes. Since all decisions are questionable, some mention of the choice of titles is desirable. It might be thought that, like letters, newspaper writings need no titles; however, many of Mill's were entitled, whether by him or not, and the titles provide an index to the material, as well as making each piece easier to identify in short form. When a title appears on the copy-text (or on another version of the text that Mill oversaw), it is used, even though there is a likelihood that a large number of them were not chosen by him. The guides to identification mentioned above, Mill's bibliography of his writings and the copy of the Examiner in Somerville College, provide many titles in his own wording or a modification of it. For example, in his bibliography Mill uses two main wordings in listing his news reports on French politics: "summary of French affairs" and "summary of French news"; in the Examiner he normally lists each of these same items as "Article on France": for convenience we adopted "French News" with a bracketed serial number for all of them. In the case of the series on Ireland, which he lists in his bibliography as being on "Irish affairs," we drew from the contents of the articles a more descriptive title, "Condition of Ireland," again with serial numbers to distinguish them one from another. In both these cases the serial numbers are editorially added; in a few cases ("The Spirit of the Age" being the best known) Mill or the newspaper provided numbers for series: to indicate the difference, we used roman numbers for those in the copy-text and arabic for those editorially supplied. A few titles derive from references to the articles by Mill in letters, and finally some, in addition to the "Condition of Ireland" series, are editorially supplied as appropriate to the contents and genre. The reviews, for example, which are normally headed in the copy-text by bibliographical identifications, are headed in our text by the author's name and the short title of the work under review. The obituary notices are (in conformity to Mill's occasional usage) headed "Death of" the deceased. Beneath the title is given the provenance and date of publication of the item, while the headnotes indicate, as briefly as is compatible with some obeisance to stylistic decorum and grace, the place of the item in relation to others in the volumes, and the minimal historical information needed as background (a broader scope is given in the Introduction, and more detail in the footnotes). Each headnote also gives the evidence that the item is by Mill and the reason for the choice of title. The context in the newspaper from which it is extracted is sketched (location within a section, general headings, for instance), and finally any information about the choice and treatment of the text (the general account of editing practices is given in a separate Textual Introduction). Appendices include a speech Mill translated for the Examiner , the French version of the article intended for the National that appeared in the Monthly Repository , the English translation of a speech by Enfantin that Mill prepared for the Examiner , the English version of the unpublished letter intended for La Voix des Femmes , an obituary of Francis Place that is dubiously attributed to Mill by George J. Holyoake, and lists of editorial interventions, as well as our Index to Persons and Works and an analytic index. Also we provide indexes to items according to their original provenance and to their signatures. 2. Copy-text For most of the items in these volumes, the selection of copy-text is Hobson's choice: that or none. As indicated above, Mill did not reprint any of his newspaper writings in the three volumes of Dissertations and Discussions that appeared in his lifetime, and only a few appeared in other versions. In only 19 cases are there competing versions: 10 appeared in part in other writings of Mill's (3 of these in the posthumous fourth volume of Dissertations and Discussions , and 1 of these also in a pamphlet and a printed version of a lost manuscript), 5 appeared in more than one newspaper, 2 have surviving manuscript versions, and 2 exist in both English and French versions. These last we included in both versions; the others, almost all of them different in kind, are printed with notes indicating the variants, and with explanations of the choice of copy-text (almost invariably the newspaper version, for that is the volumes' mandate). One matter troublesome to our consciences that will be a nightmare to editors of twentieth-century newspaper writings is that of editions. In the 1830s the Examiner (our principal source) often, but apparently not always, went through two editions, which are not clearly marked as such. We have tried to compare the two versions, without finding anything but occasionally different page numbers for Mill's articles. (One of the letters published in Earlier Letters from the Examiner had the signature "M" removed in the second edition.) But collections of nineteenth-century newspapers, even the indispensable British Library collection, seldom include different editions, and location lists are at best embryonic if not unconceived; it would be an immense task, well beyond our powers, to locate all possible existing editions of the issues in which Mill's writings appear. 19 And—once again let me show the traitorous flag—I wager that our main audience will not judge us wanting in this respect. In these circumstances, the editor's task is much lightened. But of course some emendations are called for in the interests of accuracy, consistency, and easy reading. 20 The texts are flawed in most of the ways typical of their genre: characters are dropped or broken, sorts are mixed or lacking, compositors are (by inference) inexperienced or careless, and Mill's hand has (again by inference) been misread. Also, some conventions of the genre and the period are not consistently followed in the originals, and if reproduced would be annoying to readers in the late twentieth century. While we list the emendations in an appendix, they are so numerous and in the main so trivial that we cover many of them in general categories, and correct silently. 21 For example, except when the correction was indicated by Mill or when there is a possible ambiguity or when one such correction is contained within a more significant one, we do not list but only describe in the Textual Introduction the following: 1. Dropped and misplaced characters, including misplaced or absent word space (e.g., we do not list the corrections of "discharge sthe" to "discharges the"; "o fchildren" to "of children"; or "allthose" to "all those"). 2. Missing or misplaced French accents, including those on proper names. This is a more contentious matter, but Mill's French was, though not perfect, very good, and undoubtedly better than that of most compositors, who, moreover, seem often not to have had the types (or enough of them) to hand. (In this context, one may mention that the habit of setting names in small caps meant that accents usually could not be indicated.) And there is inconsistency in nineteenth-century practice, which also differs in unpredictable but disturbing ways from twentieth-century usage. 3. French proper names. Once more Mill's knowledge suggests that at least many of the variant spellings were introduced by compositors, though one cannot know, and occasionally more than one spelling was acceptable. Our decision was to avoid the annoyance rather than keep the anomalies, so, for instance, we always give Louis Paul Courier (never Courrier), Casimir Périer (not Casimer or Pérrier), Jacques Laffitte (not Lafitte), Odilon-Barrot (not Odillon or Barrott), and (to illustrate what are more clearly compositors' errors) Cormenin (not Cormerin), and Cauchois-Lemaire (not Cauchors-Lemaire). We also cut through the hyphen knot in French forenames by printing them as separate names. 4. Initial majuscule / minuscule changes. These were made sparingly and only to make individual passages (not the volumes as a whole) consistent, on the grounds that Mill's hand is not infrequently ambiguous in this regard for some letters, and that the change in these specific words cannot be seen as emphatic. Other emendations not signalled in the apparatus result only from the desire for easy reading without any implication of error in the copy-text. For example (and most of these apply throughout the edition, not merely in these volumes), monarchs are identified in the form "Louis XVI" rather than in any other way (e.g., "Louis the Sixteenth"), other ordinal abbreviations are regularized ("22d" becomes "22nd"), names in small caps are given in upper and lower case, italics are substituted for small caps used for emphasis except when the small caps are themselves italicized (in which case they are retained in roman), and abbreviations for monetary units are always italicized ("50l." becomes 50 l. "). The styling of different newspapers is also not preserved, so, for instance, the salutation in letters to the editor is always given as "Sir,—", the square brackets sometimes given around such sub-headings as "[From a Correspondent]" are deleted, and the publishing information in the headnotes and headings is regularized. 3. Apparatus In addition to the variant notes mentioned above, two kinds of footnote are appended to the items. Those from the copy-text, that is, Mill's own (with occasional notes by the editors of the newspapers) are signalled by the series *, +, etc., beginning anew in each item. Those editorially supplied (the great bulk of the notes) are signalled by separate series of arabic numbers for each item. In accordance with the practice throughout the edition, we attempted to identify in these notes all Mill's allusions to people and references to and quotations from written works and speeches, trying to specify where possible the edition he used or may be presumed to have used; to his notes we added (in square brackets) missing identifications and corrected mistaken ones. In the other volumes (excepting the correspondence) we avoided as assiduously as our consciences demanded and as our desires would permit adding any other information in notes, believing that Mill's texts were still almost as transparent as when first read. But newspaper writings are, like correspondence, much more time- and place-bound, and so we indulged our readers and ourselves (though still hounded by conscience) by giving explanatory notes of historical and biographical (as well as bibliographic) kind. The adequacy of these is of course for others to judge, but I should say we aimed a little higher than James Mill, whose confidence in his readers was considerably greater than ours; in one not untypical note he says: "See the writings of Kant and his followers, passim ; see also Degerando, and others of his school, in various parts of their works." 22</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion These matters indicate that we have been thinking of our audience. I have speculated much on the curious mix of folk who are interested in John Stuart Mill, but I need not attempt to characterize them here, the relevant point being that they provide a differentia of our edition. More significantly for other editors, though even vaguer, is the consideration of future audiences. Scholarly editors, though they of course feel a special warmth for those who rush out to buy copies hot from the cold type, know that their volumes will sit quietly on shelves for most of their lives—that is, the lives of the volumes, which should be much longer than those of their transitory midwives. (Which of us who habitually gives presents to family members thinks seriously of giving copies of our textually sound editions to them?) So we have tried to design our treatment for the fit few who will want to know all about Mill in ages to come. What will they (or she or he) need to be told? It certainly is safe to assume that future readers will not know more about nineteenth-century England (or France, or Ireland) than do our contemporaries. And how much do the latter know? To make a worst-case assumption is not practicable, for it would entail more effort, time, and money than we can supply; it is also uncharitable, and we are essentially an eleemosynary profession. As indicated above, we have made what is almost a best-case assumption in the earlier volumes of the edition (excepting the letters), but here believe it unfair to well-intentioned readers. Somewhere in between lies the optimum case, which is related to our judgment of ourselves as representatives, even if not typical, of those to buy and to come; we are not adequate par nature , however, because in seeking for what we do not know but think should be known we modify necessarily our understanding of what we did know or thought we knew—here is a common but undiscussed analogy to the quantum uncertainty principle. Many hours were spent in discussion, decision, revision, as well as in search, and the results are certainly not perfect: like the strenuous Victorian strivers whom we emulate, we are seeking a personal best, not a perfect "10." What we have had to do is compromise, taking into account our resources, abilities, and the all-too-frequent inaccessibility of what we hoped to find. All this is somewhat obvious, and might be taken for a counsel of despair. What I have earlier said about the text will suggest the same comment. But the despair will be such only to those who seek a comprehensive theory. Let me be confessedly open: in certain circumstances, theory is merely practice with the hard bits left out. It is wisely said that hard cases make bad laws; the history of law-making and -breaking in the last quarter century, when this maxim has often been scorned, indicates, at least to me, its validity. And editing is made up of hard cases. 23 James Mill's view, expressed in my opening quotation, puts the bald position that we repudiate. My confidence in our attitude may be explicated by an anecdote. Some years ago, Claude Bissell, then President of the University of Toronto, began to explain its long-standing college system; after a few moments, an Irishman stopped him, saying: "That's all very well in practice, but it won't work in theory!" Subsequently we had a President who tried to make it work in theory, and now it doesn't work at all. Even Jerome J. McGann, in his thought-provoking Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983), where he raises many of the issues I am troubled about, though his is a literary corpus, feels compelled still to search for an encompassing theory, though his examples indicate quite clearly that such a theory would be empty of useful advice. I am not saying, let it be clear, that one can manage without principles: these we have established, and have tried to follow for twenty-five years with all the diligence and care we can muster—but also with what commonsense and experience we can preserve. All editors worth their ink try to get it right. But what is "it"? And what if there is no "right"? I hold with Edmund Burke that circumstances alter cases, and—though he did not bother to say so—that in editing all cases are different. 24 Not all are significantly different, of course, and there is much that each of us can learn from others. My debts are very great, though my repayments may not seem worth the cost of collection. As I have said, perhaps arrogantly, the differences between works are obviously relevant to the procedures used in editing them; certainly arrogantly I am implying that this obviousness has not always been obvious enough. In brief, and using categories I have employed elsewhere in discussing rhetoric, one should take into account (though not equally or in all cases) the particularities of the author, the audience, the purpose, thesis, and subject, the genre, the occasion (time and place), the "resistance" to communication, and the argument (in the broad sense)—and should recognize, as relevant, the fact that each and all of these may be, in fact likely are, plural, and that in many cases the ostensible and the actual are not identical. Of these, the most significant in our case are those of subject and audience. Mill is seldom "literary" in the narrow sense, and when he is, writes as a critic, not as an author of imaginative works. Consequently, his audiences are seldom, in their primary interests, literary. What matters for them is not what matters for close students of Elizabethan drama or seventeenth-century lyric poetry or nineteenth-century fiction. Philosophers, political scientists, economists, historians: all should care about the accuracy of what they are reading, and usually they can be persuaded that it is important to know just what basis a text has. But their span of attention for such matters is very short, and they insist on pressing on to matters that concern them more. They will, within reason (their definition of reason) humour the textual editor, but they will not offer reverence. So, trying to serve them, one must take into account their reasonable expectations (our definition of reasonable). And one must recognize the different value that minor variants have in non-imaginative prose, compared with those in Shakespeare's plays and Byron's poetry. Let me mention just one other of these rhetorical considerations, that of single authorship. Quite apart from any undetected surgery by the editors of the newspapers, there is an unresolved problem about the part played by Harriet Taylor (later Mill) in several of the leading articles and letters to the editor dealing with justice and domestic cruelty. The entry in Mill's list of his published writings says of a leader dated 10 February 1846: "a joint production—very little of which was mine" (MacMinn, p. 59). Thirteen subsequent entries for newspaper writings of the 1840s and 50s contain similar comments, one of which (for 28 August 1851) is upsetting: "This, like all my newspaper articles on similar subjects, and most of my articles on all subjects, was a joint production with my wife." 25 Several items in these volumes that are not specifically described as "joint productions" certainly can be inferred to be covered by this blanket of vague dimensions, and a few, including some of the manuscript texts, even though they are in Mill's hand, almost certainly have two authors. Even to mention the applicability of the other rhetorical variables to our practice is here impracticable. My main purpose in alluding to them is to indicate that we accept the sad inevitability that our edition cannot be either definitive or a sure guide for others. It may be that ours will be the last (as it is the first) comprehensive edition of Mill's writings, though of course some of his works will probably be reedited if more evidence comes to light and when fashions change. But the market is not bullish: even some of our most popular volumes are now out of print, though the edition is not yet completed, and I cannot foresee a time when it will be thought useful to begin again de novo on a parallel endeavour. (I am not overlooking such possibilities as electronic and microform editions.) We are also guilty of not paying sufficient attention to the considerations that D. F. McKenzie has been insisting on in recent years. There can be no doubt that the form in which a work appears affects its received meaning. His argument is always telling, and it applies with special force to newspaper writings, for newsprint affects all the rhetorical variables. Certainly a case could be made for facsimile reproduction of texts, and I for one would be happier at least part of the time if we had taken this route. But I would not be happy all of the time, for many of the texts would be illegible, and the impossibility of reproducing each of the defining qualities (the feel of the paper, the textual "surround," and so on), make the ideal unattainable; and if it were practicable, it would in many respects be annoying to most readers. Furthermore, we are not the original audience, and cannot realize fully, even with the exact artifacts in front of us, that audience's sensibilities and expectations (which of course were not uniform). Nonetheless, one should make some attempt to make the reader constantly aware of the original form through comment and reproduction of the textual context—and as many illustrations as the price will admit. As I have said, even if our edition, or let us say more specifically our volumes of Mill's newspaper writings, were definitive (taking out of the account the mistakes that we have made), I do not think it should serve as a model for others. The conditions that I have described make it necessarily different. Of course our practice will, if reasonably "right," offer suggestions to others, just as the practice of others has been of help to us. Our main effort, however, has been, and has properly been, to make Mill's writings available in a reliable form, and a form clearly explained, to those who wish to read him. That we have contributed little to the theory of editing will, we hope, be at least partly offset by our contributing something to its practice (sins and silliness included), but if finally and fully offset, it will be by our fulfilling our primary intention of satisfying our real and ideal scholarly audiences' desire for a clean and wholesome Mill.</field>

The items are attributed to the papers for which they were intended, so the unpublished items are included; one piece, intended for Le National , in fact appeared in the Monthly Repository because the former paper ceased publication before the letter could be printed. 11 The table below shows these two distributions combined: 1820s 1830s 1840s 1850s 1860s 1870s Leaders 5 86 78 10 0 3 News Reports 0 106 0 0 0 0 Letters 29 6 13 9 9 6 Reviews 4 34 7 1 1 0 Obituaries 0 6 0 0 0 0 Miscellaneous 4 8 1 0 1 0 12 Two of these are letters written in the early 1850s for publication in connection with the dispute over publishers' restrictive practices; the other is a draft concerning the Westminster election of 1865, enclosed in a letter to Edwin Chadwick, and obviously intended for public use, though we have not found it in a newspaper. 13 The manuscript in the London School of Economics, edited by Ney MacMinn, et al. , as Bibliography of the Published Writings of J.

We there describe the three volumes for 1830 and 1832-33; subsequently we located two more, for 1831 and 1834. 17 MacMinn, p. 96; he points out that in fact three further items are listed (see pp. 98, 99). In fact, drafts of all those located in newspapers have not evidently survived; however, some clippings of letters are in the Mill/Taylor Collection in the London School of Economics. 18 One item in Mill's list remains unlocated: "An article on wages and profits, capital and prices, which appeared in the Edinburgh Times of May 1825" (MacMinn, p. 6). We believe we have correctly identified, however, "A short letter on which appeared in the Morning Chronicle of 1824" ( ibid. ) as "Effects of Periodical Literature" (26 Dec. 1824). 19 Cf. the more elegant phrasing of Fredson Bowers, with reference to the texts in Vol. V of The Works of Stephen Crane (1970), "Foreword," p. ix: "That the newspapers of this country [the U.S.A.] have been exhausted would be an idle hope. . . ." 20 For an interesting account of informed judgments on a literary newspaper text, see James B.

"The Text of the Virginia Edition," p. xvii: "This aim [of establishing the text in a form as close as possible to the author's final intentions] compels the editor to treat each work as a unit, with its own separate textual problems." This dictum is repeated on p. xviii with specific reference to newspaper writings. 25 MacMinn, p. 76.

      <field name="heading_text">The Unity and Authenticity of Anelida and Arcite : The Evidence of the Manuscripts by A. S. G. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Modern scholarship has perhaps been less conscious than it should of the fragile bases for some of our assumptions about the Chaucer canon. Were it not for Chaucer's own testimony in the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women and the Retractions to the Canterbury Tales 1 Chaucer's oeuvre would appear rather slimmer than it does. For example, neither the Book of the Duchess nor the House of Fame is attributed to Chaucer in any of the surviving manuscripts. And of the twelve manuscripts of the Legend of Good Women , only one ascribes it to Chaucer, Bodleian Arch Selden B. 24, a manuscript so unreliable textually, that its claims might, in isolation, make one ponder the claims of another witness, Bodleian Rawlinson C. 86, which credits one of the Legends to Lydgate. 2 Even Chaucer's own accounts pose problems which cannot be resolved. We cannot now identify a number of works he claims. 3 And we continue to wrestle with problems of canonicity unresolved by Chaucer's testimony, in shorter passages like lines 31-96 of the Book of the Duchess , 4 or the concluding roundel of the Parliament of Fowls , 5 or of various links in the Canterbury Tales . 6 And on a larger scale, recent scholarship has raised questions about the authenticity of the Canon's Yeoman's Tale 7 and the Tale of Gamelyn . 8 Then there are works not specifically mentioned by Chaucer at all but which have been accepted into the canon on various grounds. Into this category fall many of Chaucer's lyrics, and at least one more substantial work, Anelida and Arcite . I have recently re-examined the manuscripts of this poem and come to the conclusion that the received views of its authorship and unity merit some reconsideration. Anelida and Arcite is invariably printed by modern editors as a single, incomplete, poem of 357 lines, by Chaucer, and divided into two related parts, the first, The Invocation and Story (lines 1-210) and the second, the Complaint of Anelida (211-350) followed by a brief unfinished continuation (351-357). An examination of the manuscripts casts doubt on all these editorial assumptions. The authorship of Anelida and Arcite has never been seriously questioned. 9 Skeat speaks of the "internal evidence" as "completely satisfactory" linking it with other poems, like the Book of the Duchess and the House of Fame about which "we need say no more." 10 And he does not. Robinson simply announces categorically that the poem "is of undoubted authenticity." 11 It will, I trust, become clear why it is simpler to respond to the evidence by categorical assertion than reasoned analysis. But it is worth considering the factors that have led to its being so unhesitatingly accepted into the canon. Some of these are clear. It is on a subject that links it to a known work of Chaucer's, his Knight's Tale . It has the incremental weight of every printed edition from Caxton onwards behind it. And the metrical virtuosity of the Complaint itself has consistently excited admiration. 12 In addition, the work was also a relatively popular one during the fifteenth century. It survives in twelve manuscripts. 13 Of Chaucer's shorter poems only the Balade de Bon Conseil (twenty-two manuscripts), Lak of Stedfastnesse (fourteen manuscripts) and the ABC (thirteen manuscripts) occur in more. There may be adventitious reasons for such survival in these other cases. The brevity of the first two makes them good "fillers" in fascicular manuscripts, which assemble collections of Chauceriana. And the appeal of the ABC seems somewhat inflated by its appearance in five manuscripts of the Middle English prose translation of Deguileville's Pelerinage de la Vie Humaine . 14 Anelida and Arcite is thus fairly distinctive among the shorter works ascribed to Chaucer in its appeal to fifteenth-century readers, a circumstance which, together with its intrinsic merits and its general collocation with genuine works of Chaucer, has perhaps created a predisposition not to enquire too searchingly into its antecedents. Of the twelve manuscripts of Anelida and Arcite , only three include any ascription to Chaucer: 15 British Library Additional 16165, Trinity College Cambridge R.3.20 and British Library Harley 372. At first glance, such testimony might seem impressive compared to the contemporary attributions for other works included in his canon. And the fact some important manuscripts, such as Bodleian Library Fairfax 16, do not attribute it to Chaucer, is not of overmuch weight, since Fairfax, although of considerable textual importance, only ascribes a few lyric texts specifically to him. It must be stressed, however, that none of the manuscripts is very early, and most are quite late. The earliest one is possibly British Library Additional 16165, which cannot, however, be before 1422-23. 16 Trinity R.3.20 cannot, on internal evidence, be much before 1430 but was probably compiled before 1437. 17 Fairfax 16 and Tanner 346 have been dated from the second quarter of the fifteenth century. 18 Harley 372 has been dated at about 1450 (Brusendorff, p. 190n). Harley 7333 was probably begun c. 1450-60 but was "continued for many years." 19 ( Anelida and Arcite comes about half way through.) Longleat 258 was probably done about 1460-70 (Seeton, p. 92). Huntington HM 140 is somewhere between 1450-80 (Manly/Rickert, I, 434). Most of the others are very late in the fifteenth century: Digby 181 has been dated c. 1483-85; 20 and Pepys 2006, Bodley 638 and Cambridge University Ff.i.6 are probably later than that. 21 It may be worth pointing out that Anelida and Arcite does not appear in the first early Chaucerian anthology, Cambridge University Gg.4.27, made in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. Possibly the two earliest manuscripts are those written by the mid-fifteenth century scribe, John Shirley: British Library Add. 16165 and Trinity, Cambridge R.3.20. In addition, a further text, Harley 7333, seems to derive from a lost Shirley original; this manuscript was probably written in a house of Austin canons in Leicester (Manly/Rickert, I, 214-218). Shirley himself remains one of the more enigmatic figures in fifteenth-century publishing history. We possess a relatively large number of manuscripts which he copied as well as several that clearly derive from originals which he wrote. But the purposes of his manuscript production have resisted confident analysis. He has been termed "one of England's earliest publishers," 22 and conversely, an earnest antiquarian, whose transcriptions were made for private pleasure. 23 But whatever his motives, his Chaucer attributions have proved of considerable significance in establishing the canon. For example, he provides either unique or corroborative authority for attributing Chaucer's Complaint Unto Pity, Complaint to his Lady, The Complaint of Mars, The Complaint of Venus, Womanly Noblesse Truth and others. 24 The Shirley connection is of particular importance because it gives the greatest weight in support of the attribution of Anelida and Arcite to Chaucer: Shirley attributes it to him in both the Additional and Trinity manuscripts. In conjunction with the attribution in Harley 372 this might seem more than sufficient evidence to leave the poem secure within the canon. But, in fact, the implications of all these attributions are less clear than might appear initially. To clarify why this is so, it is necessary to briefly consider how the poem appears in the manuscripts, and, in particular, what light is shed by a consideration of the content, order and title of the poem as evidenced in them. It should perhaps be stressed that neither the content nor the order of Anelida and Arcite in modern editions is that of the majority of the manuscripts, particularly the early ones. This is strikingly demonstrated by the manuscripts Fairfax 16 and Bodley 638. These manuscripts are closely related textually. They both present the main divisions of the text in reverse order. That is, the Complaint (lines 211-350) appears before lines 1-210. Both these manuscripts agree in describing lines 211-350 as "The complaynt of feyre Anelida on fals Arcyte." Fairfax simply repeats this title for lines 1-210. But Bodley characterizes these lines as "The boke of feyre Anelida and fals Arcite." Such an anomalous ordering is not easy to account for, except by an assumption that the poem as we now conceive it was only available to these copyists as two separate parts, not necessarily related or sequential. There is in both these manuscripts a concluding rubric that suggests some link between these two parts: after line 210 (here the actual last line of the poem), line 211 is used as an explicit referring back to the antecedent Complaint (see Appendix, nos. 3 and 7). But what this explicit signifies is unclear. If it were some instruction about the sequentiality of the portions of the text, it is puzzling that the scribes did not implement it in their copying. It seems that their exemplar consisted of two distinct components that they were disposed to believe were non-sequential: Complaint and the narrative portion of the text. The validity of this unambitious hypothesis can be demonstrated in other manuscript contexts. Thus in what is likely the earliest surviving version of Anelida and Arcite , Additional 16165, Complaint and narrative portions once again appear in reverse order, but this time completely separated. On folios 241 v -243 v occurs "The compleynt of Anelyda," more or less lines 211-350. Later, on folios 256 v -258 v occurs a defective version of lines 1-210. These lines are titled "Balade of Anelyda Quene of Cartage made by Geffrey Chaucer." It is, moreover, clear that the Complaint portion came to enjoy a distinct existence separate from the rest of the poem. For example, in four of the twelve manuscripts lines 211-350 (or 357) appear as a separate poem: Trinity, Cambridge, R.3.20, Pepys 2006, Cambridge University Ff.i.6 and Huntington Hm 140. In all these manuscripts these lines are designated as "The compleynt of anelyda," and this designation is also given to these lines in manuscripts that contain a consecutive text of lines 1-350, British Library Harley 372 and 7333 as does Longleat 258 (lines 1-357). Bodleian Digby 181, which also has a consecutive text, describes lines 211-357 as "litera Anelida regine." And other manuscripts, while not differentiating the second half of the text by heading, do so in other ways. Thus Tanner 346 leaves a substantial space between lines 210 and 211. Several points emerge. In the first place, the evidence of rubrics emphasizes the scribes' apparent sense of the two parts of the poem as distinct entities. And the evidence of the manuscripts themselves suggests the initial separateness of these entities in the forms in which they were available to scribes. This is clearly the evidence of the earliest surviving copies, Shirley's Additional 16165 and his Trinity R.3.20 (which contains only the Complaint), and the Fairfax/Bodley ones, as well as of the other copies which only include the Complaint. In fact, only five of the twelve manuscripts transcribe the complete poem consecutively, more or less in the order we now read it in modern editions: Harley 372, Harley 7333, Digby 181, Tanner 346 and Longleat 258. And, as I have noted, all these differentiate between the two parts either by rubrics or in other ways. These points have an obvious bearing on the matter of attribution. For there is no manuscript that unambiguously ascribes the entire poem to Chaucer. Of the two Shirley attributions, one, in Additional 16165, credits Chaucer with the first part of it; the other, in Trinity R.3.20 gives him the second half (the only part that occurs there). And Harley 372 has opposite the last line of the poem (line 350), the name "Chaucer" in the hand of the scribe. The evidence I have presented suggests that this last attribution cannot be confidently extended to encompass the entire poem. (There are other reasons for some scepticism about this Harley attribution to which I will return.) The extent to which any attribution can be reasonably held to cover the entire poem also bears on the last stanza (lines 351-357), and, in particular, the question of the poem's supposedly unfinished state. Doubts have been expressed from time to time about the likely authenticity of these lines, 25 which are, of course, the basis for any belief that the poem is unfinished. There are obvious grounds for suspicion. This stanza obscures the parallelism of lines 211 and 350 ("So thirleth with the poynt of remembraunce . . . Hath thirled with the poynt of remembraunce"), the symmetry of which might seem to mark a formal ending. More compellingly, lines 351-357 appear in only four manuscripts: Longleat 258, Digby 181, Cambridge Ff.i.6 and Tanner 346. None of these attributes the poem to Chaucer. Only Tanner 346 is relatively early. And Tanner has a cryptic note opposite the beginning of this stanza—"Belliger." What this note means is unclear. But it does seem to represent an attempt to make a discrimination of some kind between this stanza and what precedes it. In sum, the evidence for the authenticity of these lines is very insubstantial. But perhaps the most puzzling aspect of lines 351-357 appears to have escaped consideration. That is, not the question of their authenticity, but the reason why they are there at all. If any effort was made by someone other than Chaucer to continue the poem beyond line 350, why was it done in such a desultory, undeveloped way? Fifteenth-century copyists were evidently capable of writing links or conclusions to Chaucer's poem when they felt it necessary. How, then, is such a clumsy and aborted effort to be explained? A possible explanation may lie in the ordering of the earliest forms of Anelida and Arcite . As I have noted, both Fairfax and Bodley transpose the main portions of the poem, and Additional 16165 also separates them. It may be possible that lines 351-357 were originally a clumsy attempt to link the second part of the poem (211-350) to the following first part (1-210). There are grounds that could lead a copyist to believe this was a reasonable thing to do, if confronted with two apparently separate but topically related poems. The reference in line 355 to Anelida's sacrifice to Mars provides a link to the opening line of the poem ("Thou ferse god of armes, Mars the rede"). And this opening stanza, with its prayer that Mars "my song contynue and gye" (6), could be read as implying the precedent nature of the Complaint (lines 211-350). A copyist might have felt it appropriate to insert a transitional passage to make clearer this relationship. Such a passage would presumably have been added to an exemplar on a separate sheet, and could, in the course of transmission, easily become misplaced or overlooked. Hence its survival at the end of Anelida and Arcite in some manuscripts and its omission in others. Such an argument rests on a sense of the original fragmented state of the transmission of the early exemplars of Anelida and Arcite . The strange ordering of the text of the Complaint in Additional 16165 appears to support such a view. 26 It seems that it took some time for it to achieve a stable transmitted text, reflecting the order and content as these appear in modern editions. The uncertainty of the earliest surviving manuscripts with respect particularly to order leaves few grounds for believing that the modern ordering of the text corresponds to Chaucer's intentions. What we appear to have are two originally separate texts which fifteenth century scribes came gradually to amalgamate to form the poem we now call Anelida and Arcite . 27 There remains the question of authorship itself. I have already pointed to the ambiguity of the attribution in Harley 372, which cannot be confidently held to extend to the whole poem but which may only be intended to cover the Complaint. The other two attributions to Chaucer appear in the Shirley manuscripts, Additional 16165 and Trinity R.3.20. Looking at these attributions together, certain things are immediately puzzling. In Additional, where the two parts appear separately and reversed, only the first (lines 1-210 in fragmentary form) is ascribed to Chaucer: "Balade of Anelyda Qwene of Cartage made by Geffrey Chaucyer" (f. 256 v ). This is the only clear attribution of these lines to Chaucer in any of the manuscripts. The second part (211-350) appears alone in Trinity where it is described as "þis compleynt of Anelyda Qweene of Cartage . . . englysshed by Geffrey Chaucier." But in the Shirley-derived Harley 7333, both parts appear consecutively; neither is ascribed to Chaucer. Thus, while at different times he credits each part of the poem to Chaucer, at no point does Shirley ascribe all of it to him. And, in what was probably his last transcriptional effort involving it, the preparation of the exemplar from which Harley 7333 derives, he ascribes none of it to Chaucer. It is clear, as I have shown, that in the two manuscripts Shirley actually copied, Additional 16165 and Trinity R.3.20, Shirley believed that the separate parts of Anelida and Arcite were wholly separate poems. It seems that his information about both of them was less than reliable. Thus his rubric for the narrative portion of the poem (1-210) in Additional, "Balade of Anelyda Qwene of Cartage made by Geffrey Chaucyer" (f. 256 v ), contains two inaccuracies (the poem is not a balade and Anelida was not queen of Carthage). It also, as a statement, stands in marked contrast to the prolixity of Shirley's rubrics in the Trinity and Harley manuscripts and elsewhere. The rubric therefore can be placed in contexts of inaccuracy and possible uncertainty which do not serve to strengthen the credibility of Shirley's unique attribution. The rubrics for the Complaint itself in Additional are also curious. Here Arcite is characterized (uniquely) as "chiualrous." 28 And it again (together with Trinity) agrees against all other witnesses (including the Shirley-derived Harley 7333) in describing Anelida as "Qweene of Cartage" (rather than "Hermonye" as she is represented in four other manuscripts—including Harley 7333). Such contradictions between Shirley's own manuscripts and the one derived from his activities, Harley 7333, indicate that he had access to conflicting sources of information for his various copies, and that by the time he was preparing the exemplar for Harley 7333 he seems to have rejected information he had utilized when he was copying Additional. It is certainly the case that Shirley appears to have rejected any textual authority he may have once felt to inhere in Additional 16165. In the case of lines 1-210 he appears simply to have rejected Additional completely by the time he came to prepare Harley 7333's source text. There are (very roughly) some eighty substantive variants between the two for the 131 lines they have in common. 29 Harley includes one stanza omitted in Additional (141-147). And the degree of variation often amounts to virtual rewriting; for example, in Additional lines 188-9 read: For she ne graunted him hope ne esperaunce Of no kyns grace for al his attendaunce In Harley 7333 these lines become For sheo ne graunted him in hir lyvynge No grace whi he hathe noo luste to synge The readings of Harley 7333 seem generally superior to those of Additional for this part of the text. In the case of the Complaint (211-350), matters are somewhat more complex. Three Shirley-related manuscripts survive. In the probable earliest, Additional, the text appears in a unique, wholly anomalous order. Apart from the question of order, there are about thirty-five substantive variants between this text and the one in Trinity. Again, these are often striking in their extent. Thus line 318 in Additional reads I am so mased þat I dey which becomes in Trinity Haue I ought sayde out of þe waye And line 332 as it appears in Additional is To loue me best vntil þat I deye while in Trinity it is ffor to be truwe and loue me til yee deye Harley 7333 has a high degree of agreement with Trinity against Additional (it agrees with Trinity, for example, in lines 318 and 332 above). It does, however, include lines 265-268, which do not appear in either Trinity or Additional. And it does have about twenty-five substantive variants of its own from either of these manuscripts. It seems probable that the Harley text is a conflation of Trinity with some other source that also, of course, included lines 1-210. The range of witnesses Shirley seems to have employed suggests a dissatisfaction with the forms of the text to which he had access at particular times. On the evidence of its use in Harley 7333, he appears to have felt the later Trinity text preferable to the Additional one; and in the exemplar for Harley 7333 he rejected Additional for the text of lines 1-210 in preference to the unidentified further source. This repudiation of Additional in Shirley's subsequent scribal activities with Anelida and Arcite does raise substantial questions about the canonicity of the poem in general, and lines 1-210 in particular. As I have noted, Shirley provides the sole unambiguous authority for these lines in Additional. The curious form of this attribution, its evident incorrectness in some particulars, and its subsequent omission in Harley must leave the authenticity of these lines open to substantial doubt. It is also noteworthy Shirley did not credit Chaucer with the authorship of the Complaint in Harley 7333 after he had done so in the Trinity manuscript. If this indicates some subsequent denial of a belief in Chaucer's authorship it is worth recalling for a moment the authority to be attached to the only other manuscript ascribing any part of the poem to Chaucer, Harley 372. As I have noted earlier, the name "Chaucer" appears opposite line 350 in this copy. If it is uncertain how much of the poem this ascription was intended to cover, it is also uncertain whether the ascription of any of it can be held to be inherently reliable. Harley 372 is a fascicular or "booklet" manuscript. 30 The fascicle that contains Anelida and Arcite also contains a copy of the Middle English version of La Belle Dame Sans Merci that is unique among the extant witnesses in ascribing this poem to Sir Richard Roos. 31 The conjunction of this unique ascription with the ascription of some (unclear) portion of Anelida to Chaucer suggests that either the copyist has access to some unusually authoritative source or to one that was very unreliable. It is unclear which is the case. In Harley 7333 Shirley also established for the first time in his dealings with the poem a consecutive text of lines 1-350. In the light of Shirley's other efforts with the text, such a decision must be seen once again as part of his continuing effort to make sense of the manuscript evidence as it became available to him. It seems probable that by the time he came to prepare the exemplar for Harley 7333 he had become aware of other, conflated orders linking the distinct poems that now form Anelida and Arcite , such as those represented in Tanner 346 and Harley 372. But it is clear that he was not in a final way convinced that the whole work was by Chaucer, and he may possibly have come to believe that none of it was by him. External testimony serves to confirm at least his suspicions about lines 1-210. The earliest attribution of Anelida and Arcite to Chaucer apart from Shirley's is that in the Prologue to Lydgate's Fall of Princes , probably begun c. 1432; here Lydgate offers a lengthy discussion of the Chaucer canon, which adds several works to Chaucer's own accounts. Among these is Off Anelyda and of fals Arcite He made a compleynt, doolful &amp; pitous 32 The characterization of the poem as a "compleynt" is suggestive since this characterization is reserved almost exclusively for the second part of the poem. 33 To sum up: an examination of the manuscript evidence suggests that the incomplete work we call Anelida and Arcite and credit to Chaucer is, in fact, not incomplete, and is not one poem but two, only one of which was possibly written by Chaucer. It seems likely that the part of the poem which is now lines 1-210 was grafted on to a different poem which may have been, but is not certainly Chaucerian. 34 The evolution of the organization of these texts and the evident uncertainty about both organization and attribution can be traced through the sequence of surviving witnesses, particularly those copies connected with Shirley and the Fairfax/Bodley ones. More generally, what these arguments suggest is some of the ways in which manuscript evidence, evidence of compilation, textual transmission and presentation (especially, in this instance, the rubrics and divisions of a text) can be employed to call into question editorial and critical assumptions about the nature of the received text. Anelida and Arcite provides a clear demonstration that the text itself often cannot be considered profitably in isolation from the manuscript contexts in which it appears. And a consideration of such manuscript contexts may help, in the present instance, to achieve a clearer understanding of how this poem came to achieve a status during the fifteenth century that can be shown to be non-authoritative and may even be non-canonical.</field>

Edwards, "Lydgate Manuscripts: Some Directions for Future Research," in Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England , ed. D. Pearsall (1983), pp. 19-22. 25 See Brusendorff, p. 260, who dismisses these lines as a "spurious addition" and concludes that "there is no reason to believe [the poem] not to have been finished." 26 A particular problem in regard to the ordering of the Complaint is lines 290-298. These lines are omitted in all three Shirley related manuscripts (Additional, Trinity and Harley 7333), as well as in the Pepys and Huntington manuscripts. Their omission in these manuscripts provides an indication of the rather confused transmission of exemplars of this part of the poem. I hope to explore the early textual history of Anelida and Arcite in a subsequent study and to consider the issue of the authenticity of these lines. 27 In her Chaucer: A Bibliographical Manual (1908), p. 356 E. P. Hammond observes that "the independence of the Complaint, originally . . . becomes a possible question," on the basis of its appearance as a separate work in a number of manuscripts. She evidently believed both poems were by Chaucer. 28 In contrast to the Shirley derived Harley 7333 which stresses his "feyned chere doublenesse and flateryng." 29 Additional has lost two leaves containing 79 lines of the text; see further, Appendix. 30 On this term see Pamela Robinson, "The 'Booklet'. A Self Contained in Composite Manuscripts," Codicologica , 3 (1980), 46-69, and Ralph Hanna III, "Booklets in Medieval Manuscript: Further Considerations," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 100-111. 31 See further, Seaton, p. 83. 32 John Lydgate, Fall of Princes , ed. H. Bergen (1924), I, 320-321. 33 Fairfax 16 and Harley 372 both describe both parts of the poem as "complaints"; see below, Appendix. 34 Lines 204-210 are open to some suspicion. The preceding stanza, lines 197-203, provides a concluding summation to the narrative. Lines 204-210 offer a rather clumsy link that is, at best, unclearly related to what follows, particularly in the announcement that "She caste her for to make a compleynynge / And with her owne hond she gan hit write" (208-209). It is noteworthy that there is no indication in the Complaint itself that it is a letter (the only verb Anelida uses to describe her activity is "singe" (348)).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Editorial Method and Medieval Translations: The Example of Chaucer's Boece by Tim William Machan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a recent article in Studies in Bibliography , D. C. Greetham demonstrated how a medieval translation can be stemmatically reconstructed by consultation of the translation's source. 1 Greetham's argument is a persuasive one, and it is doubly important for it advances editorial theorizing about a type of text which, judging from the number of surviving examples and manuscripts, was enormously popular in the Middle Ages but which has not attracted the attention of most modern textual critics. Indeed, the tradition of editorial discussion of medieval English texts has in large part been a reflection of the so-called canon of English literature: certain works, authors and genres have been central to editorial theorizing, while many other works and genres have been all but ignored. Moreover, for the canon of editorial discussion, as for the canon of English literature, literary preference, not textual significance, has typically determined which texts merit inclusion. But whatever the aesthetic value of romances and narrative poems, to which most textual critics have addressed themselves, if the unique character of the medieval conception of a text is to be determined, the hundreds of translations, commentaries, and religious and scientific treatises need also to be considered. Editorial discussion of the textual complexity of these works will provide a complementary insight into the textual identity of medieval literature and thus may in turn indicate refinements in current editorial procedures. Accordingly, in this paper I will examine the textual complexity which confronts the editor of still another type of translation. Greetham's editorial method is not applicable to this type, represented by Chaucer's Boece , because of the problems attendant upon the translation's sources, the translator's techniques, and the scribal transmission of the text. In the "Retraction" to the Canterbury Tales Chaucer labels "Boece de Consolacione" a "translacion," and the fact that the Boece is a "translacion" has informed both textual and critical judgment. Since Boethius wrote the Consolatio in Latin, it was reasoned, Latin—specifically the text preserved in ninth-century manuscripts—was what Chaucer translated. From this perspective, H. F. Stewart's assessment that the "inaccuracy and infelicity" of the Boece "is not that of an inexperienced Latin scholar, but rather of one who is no Latin scholar at all" 2 is not surprising. While an attitude like Stewart's may have been a factor in Skeat's editorial procedure, 3 their contemporary Mark Liddell, in his edition for the Globe Chaucer, acknowledged that Chaucer used Jean de Meung's French translation as well as the Latin original. 4 The textual situation of Chaucer's sources is still more complex, however, for it is recognized today that Chaucer's sources included the "Vulgate" Consolatio (a distinct redaction that developed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries), a French manuscript which contained many idiosyncratic readings found in Besançon MS 434, the commentary of Nicholas Trevet, and perhaps the gloss tradition associated with Remigius of Auxerre. 5 With these identified sources it might seem that editing the Boece would be patently easy: simply compare the Boece readings with their sources and choose the best reading. The troublesome words here, however, are in fact "sources" and "best," but it is with the first word that I am immediately concerned. While we have identified Chaucer's source texts, we have not identified Chaucer's source manuscripts, and the distinction between text and manuscript is of paramount importance when assessing medieval translations. Cambridge University Library MS Ii.3.21 has long been known to have a Vulgate Consolatio which contains a number of unique readings reflected in the Boece . But many other readings indicate that this manuscript is not identical to the one Chaucer used. At 1p4.114, for instance, most Boece manuscripts read "decrets and . . . Iugements"; the corresponding Vulgate reading in C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 is "iudiciis," while the French reading is "juigemens." 6 The older Latin Consolatio , however, reads "decretis," and this reading must underlie Chaucer's "decrets." Similarly, Besançon MS 434 cannot be identical, or even very similar to, Chaucer's French manuscript, for at times, when Chaucer is clearly following the French, its readings are so confused as to be unintelligible. Moreover, the French manuscripts have been classified in two distinct branches, and though Chaucer's French source almost always follows the α branch of the French tradition—and Besançon MS 434 is an α branch manuscript—there are a handful of occasions when a b reading seems to underlie Chaucer's translation. Thus, at 1p5.47 all Boece authorities read "tribulaciouns"; the corresponding Latin is "tumultus" and the corresponding French of the α branch "turbacions." The b branch, however, reads "tribulacions." My point here is that the certainty and objectivity of the one-to-one correspondence implied by "source" may sometimes be only apparent. Quite obviously the Boece had sources, and equally obviously we have a fairly good idea of what those sources were. But a "fairly good idea" is not the same as "exact knowledge." Chaucer's Latin text evidently had an unattested combination of Vulgate and traditional readings, while his French text presumably contained an unrecorded mixture of a , and perhaps b , readings. If we do not know the exact Latin and French manuscripts which Chaucer used, then there must be a degree of doubt about the source of every individual reading in the Boece , even if the Latin of C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21, for instance, would seem unequivocally to be the source of a given reading. And this degree of doubt is magnified by Chaucer's method of composition. In composing the Boece , as I noted above, Chaucer used the Vulgate Consolatio , Jean de Meung's translation, Nicholas Trevet's commentary, and a few Remigian glosses. If one sits down with the manuscripts of these works—and for this purpose any of several manuscripts will do—and compares them to Robinson's or Skeat's editions of the Boece , one discovers that the Boece is a close translation in the sense that almost every phrase in the Boece is a translation from one of the four sources. But two additional points need to be made here. First, though Chaucer referred to his composition as a "translacion of Boece de Consolacione," his actual method involved much more than what Boethius wrote. In fact, Chaucer was translating from what might be called the Consolation tradition which accrued to Boethius's original text. To the Middle Ages, the Consolation was a work of moral philosophy, and then as now any intelligent and knowledgeable individual had a personal stake in moral philosophy. It is unremarkable, if not inevitable, that medieval readers grew less interested in the form of the Consolatio than in its content and that the content of "Boece de Consolacione" came to include a variety of reworkings of and commentaries and glosses on Boethius's thought. The second point which needs to be made about Chaucer's use of his sources is that though the Boece is a close translation, it is a close translation of a "source" which exists only by implication. That is, Chaucer himself, as he was translating, in effect created his source by selectively combining portions of the tradition he called "Boece de Consolacione" in order to represent the content of Boethius as he understood it. While Chaucer's procedure has general trends, his movement from source to source is not inevitably predictable. In many cases, thus, along with the uncertainty of what Chaucer's sources read must go the uncertainty of which source text he was translating. 7 Chaucer himself can add little certainty to the textual complexity of the Boece and its sources, for he does not state why or for whom he composed the translation. Moreover, there is good reason to believe that the Boece is only a penultimate draft ( Techniques , pp. 111-124), and if this is the case, then the textual picture is clouded even more. Chaucer clearly was interested in understanding Boethius's ideas and in exploring language; his primary concern was not stylistic artistry ( Techniques , pp. 85-110). Thus, although in the "Retraction" he does acknowledge "oure Lord Jhesu Crist and his blisful Mooder, and alle the seintes of hevene," it would have been impossible for him to have incorporated into the Boece the consciously authorial posture expressed in the well-known lines at the end of the Troilus : And for ther is so gret diversite In Englissh and in writyng of oure tonge, So prey I God that non myswrite the, Ne the mysmetre for defaute of tonge. (5.1793-96) 8 One might well ask: Since to Chaucer "Boece de Consolacione" meant not the form of Boethius's Consolatio but the content of the Consolation tradition, would Chaucer have demanded the accurate preservation of his text? Or would he have expected, or at least not been surprised by, a similar emphasis on content among his readers, who had as much right as Chaucer did to attempt to express Boethius's ideas? 9 Whatever Chaucer's expectations, the Boece authorities—ten manuscripts and two early printed editions which evidently derive from no longer extant manuscripts—embody a remarkable amount of scribal alteration. Assuming for the moment that the editor knows what Chaucer wrote, one is able to say that from the time it left Chaucer's pen the Boece was subject to complex transmission. In C. U. L. MSS Ii.1.38 and Ii.3.21, the two manuscripts which most consistently preserve what Chaucer probably wrote, as well as in several others which occasionally join them in readings, there is unexpectedly a cluster of Kentish dialectal forms in the middle of Book Two. 10 The language of these manuscripts is elsewhere East Midlands, and since it is improbable that Chaucer suddenly used Kentish forms in a non-poetic context, the implication would seem to be either that the archetype experienced a sudden and temporary change of scribes or that it was initially transmitted in a fragmentary fashion. In either case, one has reason to believe that Chaucer's text had undergone some scribal alteration before the earliest manuscripts. Within these manuscripts, in any event, scribal alteration is clear. In some cases, isolating the scribe's contributions from Chaucer's can be quite simple. For example, a body of lexical glosses accrued to and was transmitted with the text of the Boece , and occasionally in the later manuscripts these glosses constitute doublets with the words they originally glossed. 11 The scribal readings are similarly easy to identify in Bodleian Bodley MS 797. The scribe of this manuscript consistently modernized syntax and lexicon—"forsaken" for "forleten" (1p6.65), for instance—and the more archaic forms found in other manuscripts are certainly Chaucer's. But while it is often relatively easy to identify the basic lexicon of the Boece , it is sometimes quite difficult to identify by means of the source the authorial particle words in a group of variants, in part, perhaps, because Chaucer himself seems to have been inconsistent in his usage. 12 In a given clause, for example, it is virtually impossible to predict which preposition Chaucer used—if he did indeed use one. For instance, at 3m1.1-2 all authorities save one read "lat him first delivere it of thornes"; C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 reads ". . . fro. . . ." The Latin is "liberat arua prius fructibus," while the French reads "il le delivre avant des espines." Elsewhere, Chaucer uses "delivere" with both "of" and "fro," and so the authorial reading here is problematic. The difficulty of determining whether Chaucer used a preposition at all is nicely indicated by the following two examples, where the existence of readings with and without prepositions as translations of the same source renders the authorial form moot. At 2m5.23 C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 and British Library MS Add. 16165 read "mountaigne Ethna"; the remaining authorities read "mountaigne of Ethna." The corresponding Latin is "Aetnae," and the corresponding French "montaigne Ethna." At 2p6.5-6, however, all authorities save one read "mountaigne Ethna"; C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 reads "mountaigne of Ethna." Here the Latin is again "Aetnae," but the French has an entirely different construction. These problems are multiplied when a series of prepositions is involved. For instance, at 3p2.34-35 C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 alone reads "the entencioun of desiringes and of werkes"; the other authorities read ". . . and werkes." The Latin is "actuum uotorumque . . . intenti," and the French is "l'entencion des fais et desiriers," so that either English reading is, again, an acceptable and potentially authorial translation. It is also nearly impossible to predict how many negatives Chaucer used in a verb phrase. At 2p4.2, for example, all authorities save one read "ne I may," which matches the Latin "nec . . . possum." C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 reads "ne I ne may," which matches the French "ne je ne puis." But at 3p1.11-12 three authorities, including C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21, read "I am nat agrisen of hem"; two authorities, including C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38, read ". . . ne am . . ."; and four authorities read ". . . nam nat. . . ." All three of these readings would match Latin "non perhorresco" and French "je ne les redoubte . . . nient." These variations obviate any conclusions about whether Chaucer's negative constructions derive from the Latin, the French, or his own idiolect. Similar difficulties surround both pleonastic "that" after the conjunction "whan" and articles before many nouns. For instance, at 2m1.1 all authorities save one read "Whan"; the reading of C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21, which Skeat overlooks, is "Whan that." The Latin here is "cum" and the French "Quant." At 2p2.10, however, all authorities save two read "Whan that"; B. L. MS Add 16165 and Bodleian Bodley MS 797 read "Whan." The Latin and French are again, respectively, "Cum" and "Quant." The uncertainty about the use of articles is illustrated at 2m5.23, where C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 and National Library of Wales MS Peniarth 393 read "of mountaigne"; the remaining authorities read "of the mountaigne." The Latin has no directly corresponding phrase, while the French reads "de la montaigne." At 2m8.16 all authorities save two read "knitteth sacrement"; B. L. MS Add 16165 and Bodleian Bodley MS 797 read "knitteth the sacrement." The Latin reads "sacrum . . . nectit," and the French "enlace le sacrement." While in poetic texts, which have been the focus of editorial theorizing for medieval literature, editorial decisions in these matters can rely, sometimes controversially, on metrical criteria, we do not yet know enough about Chaucer's prose stylistics to say what forms he as a prose writer and translator preferred. Yet the structures just discussed are basic to the unity and character of any piece of prose. Doublets are also basic to the character of the Boece , and these present difficulties as well, for in many cases some of the manuscripts have only half the doublet. When both the single word and the doublet are contextually appropriate, Chaucer's reading is certainly not manifest, since even if we knew Chaucer's exact source, we do not know how he translated it. At 2p7.30-31, for example, C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 and the authorities closely related to it read "thinken ye to manifesten your renoun"; C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 and the authorities closely related to it read ". . . manifesten or publisschen. . . ." Either reading is appropriate for Latin "de peruulganda fama . . . cogitatis" and French "penéz vouz de vostre renommee monteplaier." Similarly, at 3m3.1 the first group of manuscripts reads "a river," while the second group reads "a river or a goter"; the corresponding French and Latin are, respectively, "un gort" and "gurgite." Here one might argue that "goter" is due to a perceived connection—the words are in fact etymologically unrelated—between it and French "gort." But, again, if one relies on the sources alone, one cannot know whether in this passage the perceived connection was made by Chaucer or a scribe who had access to the French text. Indeed, since some scribes clearly did have access to Latin and French texts, the variants often present several acceptable translations of both the Latin and the French with no a priori way of distinguishing among them. Earlier I suggested that the logical way to edit the Boece would seem to be to compare it to its sources and choose the best reading. I then objected to the word "source"; now I would like to object to the word "best." "Best" in what way? The objective of an editor of the Boece is not to prepare an edition of an accurate translation of Chaucer's sources. Nor is it to prepare an edition of an artistically successful translation, for as I noted above, in the Boece , unlike in his poetry, Chaucer's primary concern was not literary artistry. The objective of the Boece editor is to recover Chaucer's particular version of "Boece de Consolacione," and this version is sometimes inaccurate and infelicitous. Many of the Boece scribes, as I implied earlier, were knowledgeable and intelligent. Like Chaucer, they were interested in the conglomeration "Boece de Consolacione"—the Consolation tradition—and they could produce readings which are aesthetically or semantically superior to Chaucer's. But the editor of the Boece , or of any similar work, cannot lose sight of the fact that the desired text is not always the same as the most pleasing one. 13 Faced with uncertain sources and occasionally unadjudicatable readings, the editor of the Boece finally asks: Is there a text in this text? Most editorial problems are rooted in what Chaucer and his contemporaries understood by "Boece de Consolacione." The reference is not to the specific form and content which Boethius produced but to an undulating, living tradition which Boethius inspired. Though Chaucer did write one text, the nature of the Consolation and the latitude of Middle English prose led his scribal readers to alter the text according to their own perceptions of the Consolation tradition. Ironically, the fact that the Boece is a translation both eliminates many of the fundamental problems the editor of a narrative poem or romance confronts and creates many others he does not. In the editing of any translation the source text is not a panacea, for even if the exact manuscript source is known, we frequently still do not know how the translator would have proceeded or even if he would have translated accurately; a given Boece reading, for instance, may be due to a Chaucerian misperception—either of the form or of the meaning of a source word. In these circumstances, the modern critic can never know precisely what Chaucer's sources read or how he represented them. Moreover, the nature of Chaucer's sources restricts editorial emendation at the same time it invites it. For given the composition of the Boece , an individual reading may have arisen from any one of four sources. There may be several variants for the Boece reading and for each of the four source readings. It is also possible to conjecture a source reading to justify any one of the Boece variants; and it is possible to conjecture a Boece variant to justify any one of the source readings. Thus, an editor who employs even a mildly eclectic method in this textual situation opens up a Pandora's box of readings, whereby the Boece and its sources can be formed and reformed in any number of uncontrolled ways. Rather than a panacea, indeed, the source text can be every bit the blandishment Chaucerian metrics can be. The textual situation of the Boece requires, then, a best-text method, and the two best texts, as was noted above, are C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 and C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21; indeed, one or the other of these two manuscripts has served as the base manuscript for every modern critical edition of the Boece . In a sense, the former manuscript is clearly superior, for its text is often the more readable because its readings are often the easier. For example, in the reading at 2p7.30-31 (cited above), C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 in effect glosses "manifesten," which modern dictionaries indicate was a rare word in Chaucer's day, with the more familiar "publisschen." Similarly, at 4p4.19 C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 reads "power" for the unusual and rare verbal noun "mowinge," found in C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 and all the other authorities. A thorough comparison of the textual qualities of the two Cambridge manuscripts is not possible here, but it can be said that it is the very textual refinement of C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 which, given the way medieval readers tried continually to adapt and improve the Consolation in general and the Boece in particular, suggests that the text of C. U. L. MS Ii.1.38 embodies scribal editorialization of what Chaucer wrote. C. U. L. MS Ii.3.21 is the more authoritative manuscript, then, but it is certainly not without error, and in editing it an editor must of course draw on the evidence of Chaucer's sources. In a passage largely indebted to the French, for instance, the authorial reading in a given group of variants is likely to be that which most closely resembles the French. And the sources can aid in the correction of the order of a group of sentences which were jumbled in transmission or explain why a clause present in the Latin but not the French, for example, is also absent in the Middle English; thus, the clause which Skeat supplies from Caxton's edition at 4p6.188-189 and which does not occur in any of the manuscript authorities is almost certainly not Chaucer's but Caxton's translation of the Latin, for the corresponding French, which Chaucer follows throughout this passage, also lacks the clause. But in all doubtful cases priority must be given to the reading of the base manuscript as it stands; otherwise, if an editor of a text like the Boece employs Greetham's method, he runs the risk of producing a text possibly better than, and certainly different from, the one Chaucer wrote. 14 By way of a conclusion I would like to stress two general observations which emerge from a discussion of the textual complexity of the Boece . The first observation is that the textual identity of a work of medieval literature is dependent both on what the author intended and on how the original audience approached the work. The Boece manuscripts are what they are because Chaucer's concern in the translation was primarily with meaning and language, not with literary artistry, and because for both Chaucer and his readers the Consolation was a living text which invited reader involvement. It is this textual identity which finally must determine the method an editor employs. The second observation which emerges from a discussion of the Boece is that a coherent picture of medieval textual attitudes can develop only from consideration of the many types of literature which existed in and were peculiar to the Middle Ages. If textual discussion is motivated by literary preference, many of the works which characterize the Middle Ages will remain only textual oddities. Indeed, the aesthetic quality of individual works is in fact irrelevant in the construction of significant textual generalizations about medieval literature. We need to explore and explain translations, commentaries and treatises as well as poems of love.</field>

In a typical problem involving the particle words, all the variants are acceptable Middle English, with some of them matching the Latin and others matching the French.

Hudson's discussion of the Wycliffite scribes' improvement of their text through consultation of the Vulgate (pp. 159-161).

      <field name="heading_text">The Origins and Production of Westminster School MS. 3 by Ralph Hanna III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Westminster School MS. 3 is a squat and thick volume, in a late fifteenth-or early sixteenth-century binding of brown leather. The codex, written on vellum, contains eighteen main text items, with two later additions; excepting one of these additions, a lyric, the contents are entirely pieces of Middle English religious prose. 1 The volume belongs within a large but amorphous class of Middle English codices which provide one-volume libraries of the religious life for lay use. But some of its more interesting codicological features provide clues to its modes of production, and these may render it interesting within a more general context. To facilitate an analysis of the production, I begin by presenting a modified description of Westminster 3. At the left of the page, I note the quires which comprise the volume and the number of leaves in each; toward the right, I identify the texts which fill these quires. quires 1-8 8 1) "þe Pater Noster of Richard Ermyte" (Jolliffe M.3b, IPMEP 150) 2 9 8 "þe Pater Noster" concluded 2) (ff. 68-72) the Wycliffite commentary on the Ave Maria (Wells Rev.

The manuscript lacks signatures (three partial ones occur in quire 28) but has catchwords at the ends of quires where the text is consecutive. On the basis of features identified by Pamela Robinson as typifying production in booklets or fascicles, 8 the text appears to divide into a series of seven separate units: I = quires 1-9 (identifiable by the remaining blank side at the end and by the possibility that the short text 2 has been copied in as a filler) II = quires 10-13 (identifiable by possibility that the brief unique text 5 has been copied in as a filler) III = quires 14-17 (identifiable by the remaining blank leaf at the end) IV = quires 18-20 (identifiable by the extension of the final quire to accommodate text runover) V = quires 21-23 (identifiable by the remaining blank side at the end and by the small final quire to accommodate text runover) VI = quires 24-26 (identifiable by the originally blank final leaf) VII = quires 27-30 (identifiable by the blank leaves at the end) Further evidence not associated with quiring supports such a view. The booklets reflect the activity of three scribes, all of the early fifteenth century: the first copied five booklets in anglicana formata, the second Booklet VI in bastard anglicana, and the third Booklet VII in textura. 9 In addition, scribe 1's Booklet IV differs in format from the remainder of his copying: within a text area 130 X 90 mm. he writes thirty-two lines per page in Book IV, as opposed to his normal 130 X 80-85 mm. frame containing twenty-four lines. 10 This information, while it does not exhaust what may be gleaned from a physical inspection, 11 gives the essential data about the preparation of the text. But although it explains the book's production artifactually, it leaves unanswered a variety of questions. Why does Westminster 3 have the shape it does? How did the materials provided by the three separate scribes come to be joined? Why did the first scribe prepare his work in separate fascicular units? And where did all three scribes get their materials? What kinds of sources did they rely upon? Ultimately, these questions about textual production implicate one in questions about basic medieval literary history, the availability of works and the form(s) in which those works circulated. In the remainder of this essay, I want to address these questions briefly, using the tools of analytical bibliography and dialectology. 12 One set of questions can be answered very easily—at least as regards certain separable parts of the volume. That is, even rather perfunctory investigations will quickly convince one that the materials copied by scribes 2 and 3 are of a highly localizable sort; put otherwise, they reflect two different narrow traditions. Both sets of texts—item 16, The Mirror of St. Edmund ; and items 18 and 19, the fused Form of Living and Ego Dormio —turn out to belong to limited recensions of the texts they represent. In the case of The Mirror , one is dealing with a translation not widely attested, at least in its full form; with the Rolle epistles, a peculiar scribal redaction of relatively narrow dispersal. I would suggest an immediate inference to be drawn from this fact: scribes 2 and 3 each worked on texts of limited circulation—and a circulation quite separate from other portions of Westminster 3. One should, I think, conclude that a substantial cause of the discontinuous structure of the Westminster manuscript reflects simply this fact, that booklets were generated only as exemplars became available. Further, excepting some minor tailoring, not all a matter of economics but some of it an effort at placing thematically related works together, booklet divisions in the text correspond to distinctions of source. As an example of the kind of study which underlies this abbreviated account, I want to examine the transmission of one of the Rolle epistles in some detail. Booklet VII, as has been previously recognized, 13 provides evidence for a well-known deviant text of Rolle's epistles. In Rawlinson A 389, two copies of the work Ego Dormio occur. One of these (ff. 77-81), published by C. Horstman in the late nineteenth century, introduces numerous variant readings into the apparent Rolle original, as found in Cambridge Univ. Library Dd.v.64. The second copy, found later in Rawlinson (ff. 96 v -99) fused to the end of a deviant version of Rolle's Form of Living , plainly comes from a version like the first Rawlinson text; however, it was not transcribed from the first Rawlinson copy. This second text seems to be a verbatim transcript, the foot of each page being marked "corrigitur," a sign that the text has been rechecked against its archetype. Given some substantial variations in the two Rawlinson copies, the archetype of the second Rawlinson text cannot likely have been the first Rawlinson text. 14 This version of Ego Dormio fused with Form occurs in a very few codices of limited geographical provenance. Rawlinson A 389 (R) can be associated firmly with Lichfield, both by its language and by the fact that it belonged to canons of Lichfield at the turn of the sixteenth century. The same version of Ego Dormio also appears in a pair of manuscripts from a nearby West Midland locale, north Worcestershire—Bodleian Eng. poet. a.1 (the Vernon ms., V) and British Library Additional 22283 (the Simeon ms., S). These two mammoth miscellanies, both the size of monastic lectern bibles, share common exemplars for most of their contents. In addition to these three codices and to Westminster 3 (W), the text also occurs in a manuscript which Smith and McIntosh tell me was copied by a north Warwickshire scribe—Paris, Bibliothèque Ste. Geneviève 3390 (G). 15 The relations of these five manuscripts are fairly easy to untangle, and the variants show W rather distantly connected to the remainder of the manuscripts. Agreements of RSVG in readings probably erroneous occur extremely frequently, perhaps seventy times in the sample I have collated, about two-thirds of the Ego Dormio . 16 And within this grouping, S and V, probably copied from a common exemplar, share a number of unique readings; more frequently, they share readings with R (nearly thirty examples). Only the G text agrees in error with W to any extent—about eight readings. 17 G's agreements with W, a few provocative unique readings, and its avoidance of numerous specifically RSV errors suggest one of two situations. On the one hand, G may simply resemble W because it provides readings of a better version of the archetype than that available to RSV. On the other, its scribe may have had access to two archetypes—one which provided the readings shared with RSV, as well as a second and better copy which, like W, avoided many of these readings and provided some readings shared with W. One can represent this situation by the following stemma, only a single part of the complicated descent of Rolle's epistles: The dotted line indicates the possible G conflation. In any event, the text of W appears completely isolated: its only close congener G is more likely to have borrowed from an archetype resembling W than to be primarily descended from it. This material is provocative, because western connections for surviving manuscripts probably from exemplars related to those used in composing Westminster 3 pop up at every turn. Here collation of texts demonstrates that the Westminster Ego Dormio is most closely related to the Warwickshire Ste. Geneviève copy. Further examinations of textual relations, exercises like that I have described above but refrain from repeating in detail, indicate that the nearest textual relatives of Westminster 3 works almost invariably come from the southwest midlands. Excluding short items, Booklets I, II, V, VI, VII, and the first item of IV share this bent. Booklet I has been investigated more thoroughly than any other portion of the manuscript. The Pater Noster exposition attributed to Richard Rolle (item 1) is one of only two Westminster works to appear in an edition which analyzes all the manuscript evidence. In the case of this work, the most extensive in the entire codex, Florent Aarts has presented quite unequivocal conclusions: "Textually these two manuscripts [Westminster and Sidney Sussex 74] form a very close group. Since they avoid each other's errors, they cannot have been copied from each other, but there can be little doubt that they derive from a common ancestor, which must have contained a fairly accurate text." 18 The Sidney Sussex copy, again, is identified by the Edinburgh dialect project as a Warwickshire codex. The other fully edited text in Westminster 3 is the Benjamin Minor (item 4) which takes up most of Booklet II. Here the preponderance of indirect evidence suggests some connection between Westminster and Arundel 286. The evidence remains indirect, since Westminster is a twin of Cambridge Univ. Library Ii.vi.39; both these texts and Arundel belong to the same large branch of generally inferior copies. 19 But two factors point toward connections with the Arundel copy—a pair of other texts shared with Westminster and the sometimes erratic behavior of the scribe who copied relevant portions of the Arundel manuscript. Arundel provides two other texts which also appear in Westminster, for both of which it appears the closest textual relative. This manuscript contains a copy of the standard decalogue (item 3), which shows some correspondences with Westminster in what, so far as I can tell, are unique readings. 20 And the manuscript also includes the only other known copy of "A noble tretys of maydenhode" (item 13). In both cases, the connections may remain tenuous, but this reflects certain peculiarities of the Arundel scribe. This scribe is perhaps better considered an editor than a mere copyist. Virtually all the texts I have examined have been subjected to considerable rewriting. Most frequently, this takes the form of excisions and abridgement; somewhat less often, the scribe provides summarizing paraphrase to keep the argument of his texts afloat. 21 Thus the decalogue tract has been severely condensed, a factor which makes even the small number of agreements with Westminster particularly significant; the tract on virginity has been subjected to similar summarizing procedures. In this context, one might consider that the Arundel version of Benjamin Minor , a reasonably accurate reproduction by this editing scribe's lights, differs from Westminster, not because copied from a different archetype, but because of the Arundel scribe's freedoms. In any event, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that Westminster relied on an archetype like that available to Arundel for the contents of two booklets (II and IV). This common archetype again suggests western connections, since the Arundel scribe is another Warwickshire copyist. 22 Booklet V is devoted to a single text, a rather strange decalogue tract. Instead of offering sustained moral analysis of the precepts of Exodus 20, this discussion typically gives a translation of the biblical injunction and then illustrates that injunction by biblical translation and paraphrase alone. Unusually, this text relies not simply upon concordance of parallel precepts elsewhere in Scripture but upon lengthy biblical narratives designed as examples to illustrate the sins the decalogue names. So far as I know, there are only two other copies of the work: Laud Misc. 656, a late fourteenth-century collection of biblical histories, comes from Oxfordshire, another potential western connection for a Westminster 3 text, while the later Trinity copy is in the hand of Stephen Doddesham, monk of Sheen. 23 Booklet VI proves relatively easy to localize, since the full text it transmits does not appear widely. However, this text does appear to have been at least marginally popular in some fifteenth-century circles. Only three full manuscripts of this translation of St. Edmund's Mirror are known; however, there are several excerpted versions—one, a pair of lengthy extracts from the total text; others comprised of small segments chosen for their instructional purport. 24 Collation of sample passages from the full versions allows fairly unambiguous conclusions. The Additional ms. appears, on the basis of a number of unique additions and the avoidance of errors shared by the other texts, to be independent. Although this codex shares a number of erroneous readings with Westminster, on inspection these reflect independent coincidence, rather than genetic relationship; they include stripping prefixes from verbs and eliminating apparently repetitive phrases. In contrast, Westminster agrees considerably more frequently with Bodley 416 than with Additional (a ratio of about 2.5 to 1), and many of these shared errors are apt to have been genetically transmitted. The Huntington fragments clearly have been edited and rewritten; although a number of readings not in other copies appear potentially authorial, they may equally be examples of inspired scribal editing. 25 Because it lacks any signs of the additions, Huntington appears copied from an exemplar resembling Bodley and Westminster. Again, the closest surviving text is western: the forms of Bodley 416 are mixed, but, as Smith tells me, "certainly West Midland, perhaps Warwickshire." Thus a quite substantial portion of the materials available to the copyists of Westminster 3 seems to have come to them from a southwest midland source. In discussing these "western" portions of the codex, I have ignored two short texts which appear interspersed with these materials—item 2 (in Booklet I) and item 5 (in Booklet II). It is now time to bring them from the periphery to the center of discussion. These texts do not share the western antecedents of the materials which surround them, and indicate some minimal tailoring of independently conceived booklets to form the completed codex. I have already noted the apparent reliance of Westminster 3 and Sidney Sussex 74 upon a common exemplar for the Pater Noster tract at the head of the volume. Sidney also contains a copy of the Wycliffite Ave Maria (item 2): it occurs there twenty-odd folios after the conclusion of Pater Noster . However, if one examines the manuscript variants for this text, one finds that the Westminster 3 copy is not only closely related to that found in Sidney Sussex; in fact, the Sidney Sussex is the least closely related of all the copies. Three of the texts—Westminster, Bodley 938, and Corpus Christi College Cambridge 296—agree in a variety of readings against Sidney; of these eleven appear significant. Moreover, within the three-manuscript group, Bodley and Westminster agree against the other texts in a substantial number of erroneous readings. 26 In fact, the Westminster copy seems to have been derived from the same exemplar as was Bodley 938, some ancestor of which lies behind four texts in Booklet III (items 6, 8, 11, and 12). Apparently Westminster scribe 1 felt that analysis of basic prayers belonged together and used an exemplar which provided the central contents of another booklet to fill out a partially blank quire elsewhere. Similar decisions appear to occur elsewhere in the volume. Thus, the same supply of filler to avoid a blank occurs at the end of Booklet II, where the text is unique and perhaps even composed for the occasion. 27 And the joining of like thematic material also explains the provision of a section of Pore Caitif which discusses virginity to conclude booklet IV, otherwise devoted to a lengthy tract on the subject. The treatment of this Pore Caitif excerpt indicates one of the favored procedures of scribe 1. Much of the form his work takes appears predicated upon copying texts into booklets which depend upon available exemplars. But factors involving the potential joining of booklets into a full codex also operated. The example of the three texts which may have come from an exemplar shared with Arundel 286 is here instructive. Although he was working from a single source, the scribe divided materials from it between two different booklets. This looks like a content-oriented choice: two of the texts were of general relevance, the third concerned with a more specific topic, virginity. Moreover, the two texts which comprise Westminster Booklet 2 appear in Arundel 286 as adjacent but in reversed order—although that may not have been the original order in Arundel or in its (and Westminster's) shared exemplar. By reversing them, scribe 1 managed to create a situation in which the common decalogue tract might be brought into juxtaposition with Booklet 1: he thus established a codex-opening sequence which analyzed proverbially basic documents of the spiritual life: pater noster, ave, and decalogue. Moreover, this content-driven arrangement may also explain the separate appearance, at the end of scribe 1's portion, of a second decalogue tract. The very different rhetorical approach of this text, with its emphasis on connecting individual morality with salvation history through exemplary biblical anecdotes, may have rendered it intrusive in the earlier part of the codex. Thus, even as production went on piecemeal, dependent largely upon exemplar availability, the scribe appears to have been careful not to foreclose absolutely some important options: working through booklets, he was permitted a certain flexibility which eventually enabled him to impose a logical and thematic ordering on contents, even at a point before the codex might be considered as some unified whole. Booklet III is the messiest portion of the codes, but the issue of its sources is potentially soluble. As I have noted above, four of the texts are shared with Bodley 938, and for three of these (8, 11, 12), collation shows that Bodley and Westminster 3 share an archetype not available to other copies. 28 However, for the fourth of the texts, the popular Visitacio Infirmorum (item 6), Bodley is not clearly the source, and Westminster shows connections with a group of manuscripts which have this text and others in booklet III, including Bodley, Laud Misc. 210 (one of two surviving copies closest to Westminster for item 10, which does not occur in Bodley) and University College 97. 29 In addition to this shifting of closest textual relatives, contents of the fascicle do not neatly correspond with the contents of any surviving manuscript. I have already noted Bodley's failure to provide item 10 (while the text does occur in UCO and Laud). But given the fifty-odd surviving copies, item 7 is untraceable (and because it is a common extract, not necessarily from the same source as item 14). 30 Item 9 survives elsewhere in only two manuscripts otherwise unrelated to Westminster 3. The appropriate inference seems that one here sees the remains of a rather large miscellany of texts, now only selectively extant (according to the choices of individual patrons or editors) in a congeries of manuscripts. At this stage in the argument, however, no one will be surprised to discover that these texts could have come to the Westminster scribe from a western source. UCO, as Doyle has shown, is most probably from western Worcestershire and from exemplars also available to the Worcester scribe of the Simeon manuscript. 31 Most (ff. 20-93 v , 98-168) of the composite Laud MS. again shows the forms of Warwick, and others perhaps those of Worcester itself. (However, other portions are by Cambridge and Lincolnshire scribes.) In contrast, Bodley displays mixed dialect forms and is not precisely localizable; but, the spellings of Cambridge Univ. Library Ff.vi.31, Part II, ff. 43-99 v , copied by the same scribe, show less contamination from his archetypes and are those of Huntingdonshire. The Huntingdon forms are provocative, since they generally accord with the dialect of Westminster 3. That is, the main scribe of the manuscript has been placed by the Middle English Dialect Survey in the Soke of Peter-borough. Although hand 2 is a mixture which has as yet resisted analysis, hand 3 is similar to the first and is described by McIntosh as "extreme southern Lincs on the edge of the Soke." Thus these scribes write that kind of East Midland which the dialect project has elsewhere associated with the forms of early version Wycliffite bible manuscripts. 32 At this point one faces, I should think, something of a quandary. The dialectical similarity of the language of two of the three Westminster scribes should, I think, conduce one to think of all three as a team, although one with unequal shares: scribes 2 and 3 essentially provided piecework to accompany a much greater amount of work by scribe 1. Thus the booklets of the manuscript could reflect a bit of production economy, shared work, perhaps of a temporary team, making the copying proceed apace. And this division of labor would explain the diversity of exemplars used—the subsidiary scribes got archetypes unneeded for the copying of other, more extensive portions. But the apparent nature of these archetypes is surprising: the localism of the Westminster scribes' language does not accord with that of their sources, especially the persistent western flavor of many manuscripts most closely related to their product. Here I think that one may run up against a problem inherent in all dialect studies, whether medieval or modern. When I read a version of this paper at a scholarly conference I amused my audience by pointing out to them that I have never learned to speak anything remotely confusable with standard English and have persisted for years with a local dialect. 33 I also pointed out that through vicissitudes of family history, this is not the dialect of my birth-place; and that through further vicissitudes, I happen now to speak it near my birth-place. But, because of other accidents (in this case, large-scale social movements), my speech is no longer thoroughly outré in its current context: indeed, certain features gain support from a variety of dialects spoken in inland southern California and parts of the southern San Joaquin Valley (generally misdenominated "Okie"). I happen to speak this way, not because of geography, but because of birth: this happens to be the dialect of my mother's birth-place and has been reinforced by spending a substantial portion of my childhood in that locale. I would suggest that the various disparities uncovered in this study of the origins of Westminster School 3 might be resolved by considering similar situations. First, maps prepared by the Middle English Dialect Survey clearly show that what is being identified are phonetic variants transcribed by copyists: the isoglosses produced closely resemble those on mappings of modern phonetic variation. 34 In consistent cases, these, I would suggest, reflect birth dialects, or (what comes to much the same thing) spelling systems inculcated during scribal training which impose on apprentice writers preferred spellings corresponding to the phonetic forms of the local dialect. Scribes vary in spelling because they follow a general rule to "spell phonetically," but what they are spelling is the English they hear themselves speaking. However, as my personal anecdote suggests, the spellings only identify the scribe's birth dialect. They localize family origin. Dialect maps do not recognize migration of any sort: scribes may practice their craft in areas far removed from their place of origin, and their books may wander far from the place where they were copied. In effect, source does not identify provenance. This view allows, I think, a convenient hypothesis about the origins of Westminster 3. Any hypothesis does have to account for an impressive coherence of data: that this manuscript was copied by scribes apparently of central East Midland origin and that they had access to a succession of texts apparently of western extraction. The easiest hypothesis is that these two provincial groups had some kind of loose association in some single center, not one necessarily associated with either dialect. Here one might conjecture three different possibilities. Agreement with Sidney Sussex 74 for the Pater Noster tract (item 1), as well as the inclusion of some texts often considered vaguely Wycliffite, might place the composition of the codex in that central East Midland Lollard manuscript factory of which Anne Hudson keeps providing hints. 35 Alternatively, the binding stamp on the Westminster 3 boards, first used in the 1480s in Cambridge, might suggest that provincial center; 36 such placement might take into account the large number of texts shared with Bodley 938. But the best likelihood is provided by the known provenance of the manuscript: f. 231 bears the inscription "Amen per Ricardo Cloos the wiche is owner of this bouke anno 1472." As Doyle has pointed out, Richard Close is known from the accounts of St. Mary at Hill, London, 1483-1502, and was a frequent warden of the parish. 37 And although his name does not appear in Paul Christianson's lists of persons associated with the book trade, it is barely possible, as Doyle noted, that he was involved in book production. 38 There is one unfortunate limitation on such speculations: the inscription on f. 231 was probably written no earlier than the 1530s. However, given its meticulous copying of a Richard Close monogram (or some variety of merchant's mark) it appears inexplicable unless done by a family member, perhaps copying from another of Close's manuscripts. However uncertain this information, it nonetheless implies the simplest explanation of the manuscript and its origins. It allows one to suppose the Westminster scribes were participants in that well-documented migration from the central East Midlands to London, and that they executed the codex there. Their texts could then have come either from a western customer, who had access to and provided the copyists with exemplars from home, or from some geographically equivalent route—an equally provincial western scribe or stationer, say, who could supply exemplars. Certain aspects of this discussion should be of general relevance in approaching other Middle English manuscripts, especially religious miscellanies. First, Westminster School 3 exhibits two underlying causes of booklet production which have yet to receive analysis equivalent to that accorded features purely codicological. In this codex, booklets reflect exemplar supply: typically the scribes began copying in new booklets when they switched from one source to another. Further, booklets in this manuscript also show efforts at grouping materials within thematic or rhetorical ranges. Second, this codex illustrates another, insufficiently examined feature, that booklets, without extensive physical tailoring, may receive adjustments designed to "codicize" them, to fit them neatly together into larger, more coherent sections so as to create a full codex. Finally, my discussion of scribal dialects should provoke further thought on the migration of copyists and codices. A further conclusion strongly suggested by my discussion is the need in Middle English studies of a new type of critical edition. Customarily editions are text-centered: that is, they choose for central objects of study single works which they abstract from manuscript context. 39 I do not wish to argue that anyone should want to print a bad text, simply because it appears in one manuscript or another. But I hope that I have suggested that the combination of works which a single manuscript offers could be a perfectly sound basis for a series of critical texts with full apparatus. Such an edition would, I think, reveal a good deal about the nuts and bolts of literary history—a history which is not exhausted simply by study of source-receiver relations or of themes and styles but includes transmission and reception as well. Particularly useful would be what such an edition would have to tell about the very raison d'être of manuscript copies, for all manuscripts are involved, however covertly, in procedures of canonization, of creating literary tradition by providing (groups of) "accepted works."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix I: Brief manuscript descriptions I offer here descriptions of those manuscripts which have figured prominently in the argument above: all those which I have shown are directly related to Westminster School 3, together with a pair of relevant texts, one of considerable importance (Rawlinson A 389), a second perhaps more closely related than I have been able to ascertain (Royal 17A.xxvi). The descriptions are deliberately summary and directed to contents, scribes, and textual arrangement; I have gone to some pains to indicate the presence of fascicular production. In discussing foliation, I ignore fly-leaves devoid of textual material. All contents are English unless noted. I endeavor to be brief; thus I identify texts also in Westminster 3 simply as "W item x," give only accepted modern titles, and use references to one of the standard bibliographical tools cited in n. 2 above, with preference for IPMEP. I have generally not included references to descriptions in published library catalogues unless they are particularly outstanding or the only available printed account. Beyond the courtesies noted above, I am particularly indebted to the librarians who have enabled me to look at these texts, those at Cambridge Univ. Library, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, Bibliothèque Ste. Geneviève, and the Henry E. Huntington Library (the last especially for permission to print HM 502 as base in Appendix II).

(numbered to 278, 3 and 47 repeated), 177 X 123 mm. (writing area 137 X 77+ mm.). In anglicana. 26 lines per page. Collation: 1-35 8 . Regular signatures in the first halves of quires; catchwords (none on f. 23 v ). The manuscript has three sets of partially overlapping signatures: (1) quires 4-35 (ff. 24-278) are signed +, 2-32 on the first leaf; (2) quires 1-3, 26-35 (ff. 1-23, 199-278) are signed a-n ; (3) quires 12, 14-16, 18-25 are signed f , h-k , m-t (implying a-t = ff. 47 bis-198). Items 1-7 (ff. 1-23) probably comprise a booklet, although the concluding text is incomplete. However, this division is not fully descriptive of production. Rather, the manuscript reflects two separate plans which are indicated by the signatures. Originally, there were two booklets (set 2 of signatures above). In the process of adding a third booklet (ff. 24-), the editor seems to have discovered Pore Caitif : originally he copied only a single one of the tracts from this work (item 9, ff. 39 v -) as part of an ongoing and somewhat miscellaneous production. (For a different view, based on works intruded into Pore Caitif in other mss., see Mary Teresa Brady, Traditio , 10 [1954]:533-536.) But eventually, the decision was made to include the full text (item 16, ff. 117 v -), and this change of plan is reflected in set 3 of the signatures (which begin at the second quire containing this extracted piece). Some other tailoring, now invisible, may have gone on: a full and consecutive series of signatures (set 1) was imposed on the whole but ignoring the first booklet (still separate?). Other work to effect a smooth join may have involved suppression of a quire which stood in the place of the current 26 and recopying of the current 27. 1. ff. 1-10 a tract of basic instruction (the Pecham program); it may include a variety of short pieces known separately elsewhere, e.g. Jolliffe F.21, G.4e. 2. f. 10 rv "Four things been needful" (Jolliffe I.9). 3. ff. 10 v -13 A Short Rule of Life (W item 12). 4. ff. 13-16 "Some proverbs of Solomon," biblical excerpts. 5. ff. 16-17 v a brief tract on the Decalogue. 6. ff. 17 v -23 further biblical excerpts, ending with lengthy citation of Levit. 26. 7. ff. 24-35 v the Wycliffite commentary on the Pater Noster (IPMEP 604). 8. ff. 35 v -39 v the Wycliffite commentary on the Ave (W item 2). 9. ff. 39 v -50 the initial tract, on the creed, of Pore Caitif (Jolliffe B). 10. ff. 50-56 "Three things destroy this world" (IPMEP 170). 11. ff. 56-58 The sixteen conditions of charity (Jolliffe G.4e). 12. ff. 58-59 v a tract on charity (Jolliffe G.25). 13. ff. 60-62 a tract on the ten plagues of Egypt (cf.

      <field name="fulltext">Appendix III Below I provide a transcription of the unique and unpublished Westminster text 5 (ff. 103 v -104 v ). How men schulden be pacient in tribulacioun and euer triste in goddis helpe and neuer forsake truþe, noiþer for liif ne for deeþ . "Þe lord is my li3t," or he þat 3yueþ me li3t, "and myn helpe; whom schal I drede?" as who seie noon. "Þe lord is defendour" or mayntenour "of my liif; of whom schal I quake" for fere? As who seie of no man. 1 Vpon þis lettre seiþ seynt Austyn to | comforte cristen men in persecucioun, 2 "An erþely emperour envirouned and defendid by men of armes þat ben frele and deadly wrecchis holdiþ hym sikir fro his enemyes and bodily perelis. Mich more a cristen man" in persecucioun for truþe of Goddis lawe or good liif schulde holde hym sikir in Goddis proteccioun and drede not enemyes, siþ God hymsilf and his hooly aungelis ben wiþ Goddis seruaunt ny3t and day to teche hym, comfort hym, and strengþe hym þat no man ne feend may ouercomen hym but by his owne cowardise, for þei mowen not dye, ne be ouercomen, ne faile to helpe at nede as it is beste on alle sydes. Þerfore seiþ God by Dauiþ to a ri3tful man, 3 "I am wiþ hym in tribulacioun; I schal delyuer hym and glorifye hym." And Iesu Crist seiþ to hise apostlis, 4 "I am wiþ 3ow in alle dayes vnto þe eende of þe world." And Seynt Iame techiþ in his epistle þus, 5 "My breþeren, deme 3ee all ioye whanne 3ee fallen into dyuerse temptaciouns," þat is bodily persecucioun for þe truþe of Goddis lawe. And resoun schulde stire men to þis triste and ioye in God siþen God is eendeles my3ty, eendles witty, and eendeles ful of good wille. He wil best ordeyne fort'o' meyntene his truþe and his seruauntis and kan best do it, | and no creature may lette hym of his ordenaunce. Þerfore seiþ Seynt Poule, 6 "God is feiþful," or trewe, "þat schal not suffre 3ow to be temptid more þan 3ee mowe bere, but schal make purueyaunce" of grace and helpe "with temptacioun." Þerfore as Poule seiþ, 7 "Blessid be God and fadir of oure lord Iesu Crist, fadir of mercy and God of al comfort, þat comfortiþ vs in al tribulacioun." For certis as no creature may destroye God, so no creature may destroie fully his lawe. But as bi þe grete peyne and deeþ þat Crist suffride whanne Iewis gessedyn þat þei hadde fully destroied hym and his techyng, boþe he and his techyng weren more magnyfied and glorified, so whanne worldly wrecchis ful of pride, ypocrisye, and couetise wenen to stoppe most Goddis lawe, it schal be knowyn and magnifyed, and þei next confusioun as þe wickid Iewis weren. And al þe persecucioun and sclaundre þat comeþ to Goddis trewe seruauntis schal turne hem to good, as holy writ seiþ, to exercise of pacience, mekenes, and brennyng charite and hi3e blisse in heuen, maugrey alle þe feendis of helle and all þer false mynystris. Þerfore no man grucche þof God suffre his law born doun for a litil tyme, for þei boþe schul rise þe strenger and more glorious. For no creature may, ne can, ne wil ordeyne or cast for magnifiyng of his lawe and seruauntis as God doiþ. Þerfore be euery man trewe to þe deeþ, and he schal haue þe corowne of euerlastyng liif as God seiþ in þe apocalips, 8 "for all þat wil pytously lyue schullen suffre persecucioun." Explicit .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * In the preparation of this paper, I've profitted from some kindnesses beyond the ordinary. Mr. John Field, the librarian at Westminster School, was unfailingly generous in giving me access to the manuscript during the end of a busy term. The Research Committee of the UCR Academic Senate provided me with funds which have underwritten the research behind the paper; these allowed me to visit Westminster School and other libraries with manuscripts related to the project. As he has done for many, A. I. Doyle has offered valuable counsel and, in moments of depression, encouragement. Sally Horrall forced me to develop the paper by commanding that I read a version of it at the Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo, 1986. Finally, my colleague Robert N. Essick and friend Jeremy J. Griffiths have read through several drafts; the paper is generally the better for their many suggestions about matters of presentation. 1 For descriptions, see: most extensively, Neil R. Ker, Medieval Manuscripts in British Libraries, Vol. I: London (1969), pp. 422-424 (a few confusions in the physical description, p. 424, seem to reflect Ker's revision of his numbering of text items); also F. G. A. M. Aarts ed., Þe Pater Noster of Richard Ermyte (1967), pp. xi-xiii (note also Aarts's frontispiece, which reproduces f. 2 v of the manuscript); and Phyllis Hodgson, Deonise Hid Diuinite , EETS 231 (1955), pp. xvi-xvii. 2 I identify the contents by reference to the following standard bibliographical tools: P. S. Jolliffe, A Check-List of Middle English Prose Writings of Spiritual Guidance (1974); John Edwin Wells, A Manual of the Writings in Middle English 1050-1400 (1916, with nine supplements, 1919-51); the revision of Wells (hereafter "Wells Rev."): J. Burke Severs and Albert E. Hartung eds., A Manual of the Writings in Middle English 1050-1500 (1967-); Anne Hudson, "Contributions to a Bibliography of Wycliffite Writings," Notes and Queries , 218 (1973):443-453, supplements the last on Wycliffite items; R. E. Lewis, N. F. Blake, and A. S. G. Edwards, Index of Printed Middle English Prose (1985); and Rossell Hope Robbins and John L. Cutler, Supplement to the Index of Middle English Verse (1965). Titles in quotation marks are from the manuscript's rubrics; titles italicized are those given by modern editors. 3 The text is printed from the Simeon copy (British Library Additional 22283) by W. Nelson Francis ed., The Book of Vices and Virtues , EETS 217 (1942), pp. 316-333. For this title and a preliminary list of copies, see A. L. Kellogg and Ernest W. Talbert, Bulletin of the John Rylands Library , 42 (1960):365 (not superseded by a different set of categories proposed by Anthony Martin, Bulletin of the John Rylands Library , 64 [1981]:201-202). For some further copies, see The Index of Middle English Prose, Handlist I (1984), p. 35. 4 The text is printed from Harley 1022 and Bodley 938 by C. Horstman, Yorkshire Writers , 2 vols. (1895-96), I:158-161. 5 So far as I know, this unpublished tract is found elsewhere only in Laud Misc. 656 and Trinity College Cambridge B.14.54; I describe its rather unusual explanatory techniques below. 6 Several Middle English Mirror translations have been printed: see Yorkshire Writers I:219-240 (from Lincoln Cath. 91), 241-261 (from the Vernon ms.); and J. H. L. Kengen ed., Memoriale Credencium (Univ. of Nijmegen diss., n.d.), pp. 205-236. For manuscript distribution of this unpublished version, see below, n. 24. 7 For editions of the Rolle epistles, see Yorkshire Writers , I:3-61; and Hope Emily Allen, English Writings of Richard Rolle (1931), pp. 60-72, 81-119. Quires 28 and 29 have been reversed in binding but are marked so that the transposition is clear to the reader (A i on f. 212 v matches A i at the head of quire 28, and B ii on f. 228 v answers B ii at the head of quire 30). 8 "The 'Booklet': A Self-Contained Unit in Composite Manuscripts," Codicologica , 3 (1980):46-69; and see her important extensions of these ideas, Studies in the Age of Chaucer , 8 (1986):224. See also Hanna, "Booklets in Medieval Manuscripts: Further Considerations," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986):100-111. 9 I adopt the terminology developed by M. B. Parkes, English Cursive Book Hands 1250-1500 (1969). 10 Indeed, even greater adjustments must take place on the concluding f. 162 v to finish within the quire. On that final side the writing area extends to 175 X 90+ mm., all the way to the page foot, and there are forty lines. 11 More, for example, could be written about scribe's 1's inks and pens. For example, ff. 1-32 are in a black ink; the shade shifts to a bright brown for ff. 32 v -97. On f. 98 the ink is again black and remains so through the Benjamin minor ( i.e. , to f. 103 v ); thereafter it becomes light brown, with a few black patches until f. 136. The final portion of this scribe's text, ff. 137-80, is written in a very light brown ink. This information indicates at least that item 5, identified on other grounds as potentially filler, was not copied as a piece with preceding materials; similarly, Booklets IV and V stand out from the remainder. 12 For information on Middle English dialects and the provenances of the individual manuscripts discussed, I am enormously indebted to Prof. Angus McIntosh and Dr. Jeremy J. Smith for their generosity with information. 13 See Margaret G. Amassian and Dennis Lynch, " The Ego Dormio of Richard Rolle in Gonville and Caius MS. 140/80," Mediaeval Studies , 43 (1981): 218-249, esp. pp. 218-220. 14 I cite materials only from Ego Dormio , since the Westminster 3 text of Form of Living appears extensively paraphrased and thus does not provide the most useful evidence for discovering the archetype of the work. Examples of loci where the first copy of Ego Dormio in Rawlinson A 389 (R1) differs from Allen's textus acceptus include (the lineation is that of her English Writings ): *1 Þai] Þe R1; *2 herken] helde þi eeren R1; *3 I] þat I haue set at þe bygynnyng of my writynge I R1; *5 wirkand] and oþer deed doynge R1; 6 es] om.

The readings I star may well be those of Rolle's original; one might replace them with the following additional errors: 62 þis worlde and] om. R1; 64 sownes] semes and is R1; 66 and joy] om. R1; 67 in] of R1; 71 have and] om. R1; 73 wyt] wryte R1; 77 Forþi] For R1; 80 of þis worlde] om.

Ker, Medieval Libraries of Great Britain , 2nd edn. (1964), p. 115; and his "The Migration of Manuscripts from the English Medieval Libraries," Library , 4th ser. 23 (1943):1-11, esp. pp. 4-5. See also A. I. Doyle, "A Survey of the Origins and Circulation of Theological Writings in English . . .," 2 vols. (Cambridge diss., 1953), II:143-147. For Vernon and Simeon, see Doyle, "The Shaping of the Vernon and Simeon Manuscripts," in Beryl Rowland ed., Chaucer and Middle English Studies in Honour of Rossell Hope Robbins (1974), pp. 328-341; and Robert E. Lewis and Angus McIntosh, A Descriptive Index of the Manuscripts of the Prick of Conscience (1982), pp. 73, 103. 16 Of the thirty-eight R1 variants cited in n. 14, twenty appear in the same form in all copies of this recension: in the second Rawlinson text, Westminster 3, Vernon, Simeon, and Ste. Geneviève. The exceptions, most of them variants clearly derived from the R1 reading, usually involve all these copies in agreement and include: 1 Þai] Þow; 2-3 it es] I fynd; 16 lufe] þe lufe of; 27 a sterne] þe starres; 32 mykel] mykel god W, cf. god mychel serued rest ; 40 and] þat RSV, and þat W; 40 another] any oþer WR, mony oþere SG, in moni oþere V; 44-45 stabil . . . byrnande] stably loue hym ( om.

Appendix I below provides descriptions of Ste. Geneviève 3390 and of other manuscripts closely associated with the production of Westminster School 3. 18 Aarts, Pater Noster , p. xxiv; pp. 57-101 present a selected corpus of variants, 155-159 a single passage from all the manuscripts in parallel. 19 For Hodgson's discussion of the textual transmission of Benjamin , see EETS 231, pp. xx-xxii; group B, to which both Westminster and Arundel belong, includes nine of the twelve witnesses to the text. 20 I have collated fully eight manuscripts, seven which seem on the basis of contents most likely to have some relation to Westminster, and one "wild card." I cite the text of Simeon from EETS 217 (see n. 3 above) by page and line number (which I have supplied). Readings unique to Westminster and Arundel are (the variant shared by the two manuscripts follows the lemma): 320/15 þe foorme or] om. ; 322/34 agree in transposing phrases; 327/3 alle] om. ; 331/4 bere] add fals; 331/13 wilne ne] om. In addition, both texts agree uniquely with Royal 17A.xxvi at 324/33 worschupe] worschipyng; 326/22-23 And þei þat so don] whose doiþ; and with Ste. Geneviève 3390 at 326/1 fleo monslauhtre in alle þinges] om. with further rewriting. Royal, Westminster (with Arundel), Ste. Geneviève, and University College Oxford 97 appear genetically related, perhaps Royal and UCO most closely. My collation suggests that the printed Simeon text is probably a more adequate rendition of the original than any of these, although it includes about thirty unique and erroneous readings which a critical edition would remove. The other copies which I have collated are Laud 210 (a small fragment, beginning at 332/23) and Huntington HM 744. 21 An excellent introduction to the foibles of this scribe is available in Angela Barratt, The Book of Tribulation , Middle English Texts 15 (1983), esp. pp. 11-12 and 16-18. The Arundel version of this work cannot be collated with other copies; Barratt's full presentation of the text, pp. 134-143, facilitates comparison with other manuscripts of BT . See further Helen M. Moon, Þe lyfe of soule (1978), pp. xvi, xix, lxxxix, for discussion of the Arundel scribe's handling of that text. 22 So also Barratt, p. 36, quoting McIntosh and Smith's collaborator, M. L. Samuels, "central Warwicks., somewhat south of Coventry." 23 For Laud 656, see Doyle, in David A. Lawton ed., Middle English Alliterative Poetry and its Literary Background (1982), pp. 93 and 143, n. 17; and M. L. Samuels, "Langland's Dialect," Medium AEvum , 54 (1985):239. Doyle is also responsible for the identification of Doddesham with the Trinity copy; see also his initial discussion of Doddesham's work, "A Survey," II:183. 24 The other full manuscripts are British Library Additional 10053 and Bodley 416. Huntington HM 502 has two extensive chunks from this work, and excerpts from those chapters which present basic instructional materials from the "Pecham program" appear in British Library Additional 60577; Harley 2398; Cambridge Univ. Library Ff.ii.38 and li.vi.43; Trinity College, Cambridge B.14.50 and R.3.21; Edinburgh Univ. Library 93; and Queen's College, Oxford 324. See Edward Wilson, The Winchester Anthology (1981), pp. 32-33. 25 Because this text remains unedited, the lengthy demonstration here appears as Appendix II. 26 I have not examined the Norwich ms. (described Ker, Medieval Manuscripts III [1983], p. 521). Within the group Westminster-Corpus-Bodley, WB agree in error seven times; the only other two-text variants are four examples of BX and three of SB. Only one BX variant appears potentially genetic, rather than merely coincidental error. As the description in Appendix I will suggest, the Sidney text (not in the same fascicle as the Pater Noster ) came from a separate exemplar. The Westminster 3 scribes had variable access to multiple exemplars used by related codices—with Sidney and UCO 97, apparently access to the exemplar behind one booklet only; with Arundel 286 and Bodley 938, access to exemplars distributed by those other scribes among separate fascicles. See also n. 30 below. 27 Because the work is very brief, I print it in full as Appendix III. 28 Doyle long ago, on the basis of contents and similarities of format, suggested connections between Bodley and Westminster; see "A Survey," II:25-27. In item 8, elsewhere entitled "The Short Rule of the Life of Our Lady," Westminster agrees almost word for word with Bodley for the entire brief text. In "A tretis of weddid men," Westminster and Bodley share thirty-six erroneous readings, a total in excess of the sum of all other two-text agreements in error (Westminster and the fragmentary Cambridge Univ. Library Ii.vi.55 err together four times; Bodley and Ii, five times; Harley 2398 and Bodley, four times; Harley and Ii, four times; Westminster and Harley, twice). Corpus Christi College Cambridge 296 appears largely independent of the other copies, although it frequently (perhaps thirty times) appears to err; I have not seen this manuscript's text of "A schort reule of lyf." Among the remaining copies of this work (item 12), Bodley and Westminster agree ten times in error; Westminster and Harley 2398, twice; Bodley and Harley, three times. Laud Misc. 174 appears independent of these copies; apparently, from the sparse collations in Arnold, it agrees with Corpus in several of these independent readings. 29 There are thirteen manuscripts of this version of the Visitacio , of which I have fully collated seven (Westminster, UCO 97, Bodley 938, the fragment in Laud Misc. 210, Harley 2398, Royal 17A.xxvi, and Cambridge Univ. Library Nn.iv.12). There are very few agreements involving small numbers of copies: these seem to suggest that Bodley, Royal, and Westminster are genetically related (BR agree seventeen times in error, BW five times, all three seventeen times). Harley and Cambridge, UCO and Laud also seem to form distinct genetic groups, but the exact nature of transmission is rendered opaque by large and shifting numbers of erroneous agreements involving four and five manuscripts and at least ten "scattering" variants involving three manuscripts. In the brief tract on love (item 10), few erroneous agreements occur. Westminster, Laud, and Harley 2385 share four errors; within the group Laud and Harley agree in error three times, Westminster and Harley once. The only other "substantial" group of erroneous agreements (two errors) involves Laud, Harley, and Douce 246. 30 Bodley 938 has the full Pore Caitif , but the text is not related to that of either Westminster excerpt. This is not surprising, since codicological evidence suggests that Pore Caitif was added to Bodley at a point after use of the exemplars shared with Westminster 3. See Appendix I. 31 A. I. Doyle, "University College, Oxford, MS 97 and its relationship to the Simeon Manuscript (British Library Add. 22283)," in Michael Benskin and M. L. Samuels eds., So meny people longages and tonges (1981), pp. 265-282. Doyle, "A Survey," II:39-40, independently of dialect evidence, associated Laud Misc. 210 with Streynsham, Worcester. 32 See McIntosh, quoted by Aarts, p. lxxix. 33 Sometimes taken as typical of the bizarrities of this speech-form is the thoroughgoing distinction of vowels in can and can't : although the former has the normal vowel found in all American dialects, the latter has the vowel of cane . I am grateful to Linda E. Voigts for drawing this crime against the language to my attention. 34 See the three extensive maps in print: two for various western forms of "she," in Morton W. Bloomfield and Leonard Newmark, A Linguistic Introduction to the History of English (1963), p. 221; and in Barbara M. H. Strang, A History of English (1970), p. 420; and for forms of "church/kirk," in Charles Jones, An Introduction to Middle English (1972), pp. 212-213 and foldout opposite p. 196. 35 See most recently the discussion in English Wycliffite Sermons I (1984), pp. 192-202. 36 The binding stamp was identified by Ker, Medieval Manuscripts , I:424. On the Unicorn Binder, see further J. B. Oldham, English Blind-Stamped Bindings (1952), plate I, stamp 3; and G. D. Hobson, Bindings in Cambridge Libraries (1929), pp. 40-43. 37 See Doyle, "A Survey," II:27; and "University College," pp. 271 and 279, n. 47. The records of St. Mary at Hill have been published in EETS 125, 128; references to Close appear at pp. 30-34, 126, 142-143, 146, 170, 182, 183, 205, 207, 214, 232, 245. 38 See the accounts for 1494/95 (EETS 125, p. 214): the wardens enter a payment of 3 s. 4 d. to "Richard Close for j. bokskynne." This sounds an excessively large payment for binding, but that is presumably what Close was contributing (even if the text is taken to mean "buck-skin"). 39 Interestingly, in her edition of The Book of Tribulation , Barratt provides an excellent analysis of the Arundel scribe's treatment of that work; but her silence suggests that she remains unaware that many texts in the codex show similar handling.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">An Epitaph for Richard, Duke of York by Richard Firth Green</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On December 30, 1460, Richard, duke of York, together with his second son, Edmund, earl of Rutland, was killed fighting against the supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou at the battle of Wakefield. In cruel mockery of the duke's regal aspirations the victors displayed his head, wearing a paper crown, over the main gate of the city of York; his body (along with Rutland's) was buried at Pontefract. An epitaph for Duke Richard, written in French apparently by a contemporary, was printed by Thomas Wright from a single manuscript copy (B.L., MS. Harley 48, fol. 81 v ) in 1861. 1 Wright's remains the only edition of this poem, despite the fact that at least two other manuscripts—College of Arms, MS. M3, fol. i v (known as "Ballard's Book"), and B.L., MS. Stowe 1047, fol. 217 r (the historical collections of Francis Thynne) —contain copies of it. These two manuscripts, in fact, not only provide important information about the text of the poem itself, but also raise some interesting textual and bibliographical questions about it. The epitaph in question refers to York's son Edward as the current ruler (line 21) so it can hardly have been written at the time of the duke's actual death (Edward IV was not crowned until March, 1461), but the Harley version gives no other indication of its date, and those historians who have noticed it at all seem reasonably enough to have assumed that it belongs early in the new decade. 2 A reference to Edward's "beaulx enfans" (line 24) in Thynne's version, however, makes it clear that the epitaph cannot have been written earlier than 1467 (when his second child was born), and, in fact, four lines which are omitted by Harley, but which both the other manuscripts preserve (lines 25-28), make it possible to date the poem with even greater precision. These lines allude to Edward's pious respect for his father's wish to be buried at Fotheringhay, and there can be little doubt that the epitaph was written at the time of the removal of the duke's bones from Pontefract and his reinterment, together with the body of the earl of Rutland, in the family vault at Fotheringhay College, an event which took place at the end of July, 1476. 3 Simple piety was by no means Edward's only motive in reinterring the bodies of his father and brother. The king was well aware that such a public display of filial duty could not but strengthen his own claims to the throne in the eyes of the people, and accordingly he spared no expense to produce a dazzling display of dynastic propaganda. 4 A splendid procession, led by Richard duke of Gloucester and including four bishops and two abbots, took eight days to convey the bodies from Pontefract to Fotheringhay. On the hearse lay an effigy of the duke of York "w ith an angill stondyng in whitt holdyng a crowne ou er his hede In tokyn that he was kyng of right," above which hung a twelve-foot high cloth "with an Image of oure lord sittyng on a Raynbowe betyn in gold hauyng on eu er y cornar a scochyn of his armes of ffraunce &amp; englond quarterly." 5 Some idea of the scale of the proceedings is given by the fact that the reinterment was followed by a feast for perhaps as many as twenty thousand guests, with alms distributed to five thousand poor. 6 The epitaph for the duke of York is linked to this ceremony not merely by its mention of Fotheringhay and by its emphasis on the legitimate claims of York's descendants, but also by the strong indication in its second line ("ycy gist la fleur de gentilesse") that it was written to be displayed over the tomb itself. Familiar from Claudio's epitaph to Hero—"Hang thou there upon the tomb, | Praising her when I am dumb" ( Ado. V. iii. 9-10)—the fashion for displaying such funerary verses can be traced well back into the fifteenth century. An epitaph in English for Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (d. 1447), appears to have been designed for just such a purpose; 7 toward the end of the century Caxton reports that beside Chaucer's tomb was to be found "wreton on a table honging on a pylere his Epitaphye maad by a poete laureat"—a monument Caxton himself had apparently had set up; 8 over a hundred years after Henry VII's death (in 1509) his tomb, according to John Weever, was still "compassed about with verses, penned by that Poet Laureat (as he stiles himselfe) and Kings Orator, Iohn Skelton." 9 Unfortunately, none of the accounts of the duke of York's reinterment mention such funerary verses, nor are they included in a surviving English inventory of the trappings of the hearse—presumably because they would have had little material value. 10 Scofield has identified the author of the epitaph for the duke of York—clearly a much less skilled poet than John Skelton—with Chester Herald (I: 123), but though the author may well have been one of Edward's officers of arms, there are reasons for questioning this particular ascription. B.L., MS. Harley 48, written in a late fifteenth-century hand, was certainly copied by a Chester Herald (very probably Thomas Whiting, who held that office from c.1473-c.1495, and who was actually present at the duke of York's reinterment), 11 since "Chestre le herault" is written on the inside of the original vellum wrapper, and this signature appears after three of the items in the manuscript: an account of a tournament fought by Philip de Lalaing in 1462 (fols. 53 v -77 v ), the description of the reinterment of Richard of York (fols. 78 r -81 r ), and the epitaph (fol. 81 v ). The first of these, however, was evidently copied, not composed, by Whiting (though it is just possible that its author was his predecessor as Chester, John Water), 12 and errors and omissions in the other two make it very unlikely that either is an autograph. 13 Neither line 22 nor 24 of the Duke of Yorks epitaph in Harley looks authentic; the second, in particular, appears to be a scribal attempt to make sense of a semilegible exemplar. If the Harley version of the epitaph may well have been copied by an eyewitness to the ceremony, the same might equally be claimed for the College of Arms copy. An inscription on fol. i r of College of Arms, MS. M. 3. reads "This boke was bought of the wydow of Marche king of armes by gartier Roy darmes des anglois A o VI to Regis Henrici septimi" (i.e. 1490/1). The March King of Arms referred to here was William Ballard, who seems to have copied much of the volume (including the York epitaph) in his own hand. 14 Unfortunately, the date at which Ballard assumed the office is uncertain, but if it was, as Wagner claims, c. 1475, he would have been the March King of Arms mentioned in both French accounts as present at the Fotheringhay reinterment. 15 However, he is as just as unlikely as Chester to have composed the epitaph himself; the blunder "ffornie ai" for "Fodringey" (line 27) would hardly appear in an autograph, even if we allow that the omission of line 29 is a possible slip for an author copying his own work. The final copy of the York epitaph was made over a hundred years after the reinterment. Francis Thynne compiled his volume of historical notes (B.L., MS. Stowe 1047) between 1562 and 1602, and his habit of periodically recording the date on which he made an entry allows us to show that he copied the duke of York's epitaph (fol. 217 r ) between 1587 and 1589. 16 Thynne's copy, which gives the only complete version of the poem and provides by far the most reliable text, is an excellent illustration of the principle of recentiores, non deteriores ; by the same token, it invites us to try to explain the superiority of so late a copy over those made by two of the author's contemporaries (possibly even his colleagues). None of the three witnesses to the text of the duke of York's epitaph is descended from either of the others. Obviously neither the Harley (H) nor the College of Arms version (A) can have been copied from Stowe (S), since they predate it; equally, A and S are independent of H (which lacks lines 25-28), and H and S are independent of A (which lacks line 29). The fact that A and S agree against H at lines 30 and 33 (whereas H and S never agree against A, except in insignificant details) might be held to suggest that these two are descended from a lost intermediary, but the existence of three readings (lines 1, 22, and 24) in which none of the witnesses agree (even though in the last two A and S are closer to each other than to H) seems to imply that all three are descended from a single archetype. 17 Is it too farfetched to imagine that this archetype was the copy hanging over York's tomb, and that A and H at least were copied from it at, perhaps, no more than one remove? Such a hypothesis might help to explain the large number of errors in these two copies, since conditions would have been far from ideal at the time their exemplars (presumably the field notes of an officer of arms) were made. S, however, could hardly have been taken down directly from the original copy where it hung over the tomb, for by Thynne's time that part of the church had fallen into decay. William Camden, whose Britannia first appeared in 1586, writes of Fotheringhay, "Ricardus Dux Eboracensis eius [Edward, duke of York's] e fratre nepos qui apud Wakefeld occubuit, eiusq ue vxor Cecelia Neuill magnifica sepulchra habuerant, quae simul cum superiori parte ecclesiae fuere subuersa" [Edward's fraternal nephew, Richard, duke of York, who fell at Wakefield, and his wife Cecily Neville had had magnificent tombs which have been destroyed together with the upper part of the church]. 18 This destruction was a consequence of the dissolution of the monasteries (Fotheringhay being a collegiate church), and an inventory made by the king's commissioners at that time proves the tomb and its trappings were then still intact: "It em a old penon of changeable sylke w ith the Armes off y e Duke of Yorke. It em a fair herse cloth of blak tyssew &amp; blak velvet. . . . / It em a pece of blak buckram wi th a painted fygure of god sytting on y e raynbow. . . . / It em a faire herold es cote of gold of tharmes of Ingland the ground velvet." 19 The possible routes by which an accurate copy of the duke of York's epitaph might have come into Thynne's hands are many. He might, for instance, have found it in a herald's commonplace book or even visitation (though his own formal association with the College of Arms did not begin until 1602, when he was created Lancaster Herald); more probably, he could have stumbled on a copy made by someone of antiquarian sympathies at the time of the dissolution, or even on the original itself, somehow preserved from destruction. In this regard, there is the intriguing possibility that his own father William Thynne, controller of Henry VIII's household, might have come across it in the course of his search for Chaucer manuscripts: "[he] had comissione to serche all the liberaries of Englande for Chaucers works, so that oute of all the Abbies of this Realme (whiche reserved anye monumentes thereof) he was fully furnished with multitude of Bookes." 20 The duke of York's epitaph, now that we can be sure of its date and the circumstances under which it was written, is not without historical interest. To give only one example: its enthusiastic account of the duke's French campaigns, particularly his operations around Pontoise (lines 11-14), 21 becomes more significant when read in the light of his son's continental expedition and the peace, regarded by many as an ignominious one, made by him at Picquigny (1475). A new edition of the poem, supplying the gaps in Wright's text and correcting its errors, seems therefore worth including here. Since Thynne's copy, however he came by it, is by far the best, I have based my text on the Stowe manuscript (S); departures from it are given in square brackets, and all significant variants in the Harley (H) and College of Arms (A) manuscripts are recorded below. Expanded abbreviations have been italicized; punctuation and capitalization are editorial.

[Amen] [Translation: Be it remembered by all noble hearts that here lies the flower of courtesy, the great duke of York, Richard by name, royal prince, famous warrior, wise, brave, of virtuous life, who truly loved loyalty without malice. In many lands he was proved lawful descendant of the crowns of England and France; in parliament held at Westminster he was properly acknowledged and found to be the true heir. And as regent and governor of France, he kept Normandy free from trouble; he crossed the river at Pontoise; he drove off the French king and his dauphin. He established such government in Ireland that he ruled the country peacefully. For a long time he was protector of England; he loved the people and was their defender. He had a noble line of children (whom God save) of whom the eldest is called Edward, who is the true king and conquered his birthright; he acquired it through great effort and danger. He is sole ruler to this day. He has fine children—God keep them from harm! And this king as a sign of his goodness, knowing his father had resolved that his body should rest at Fotheringhay, had him most nobly buried thus. This noble duke died at Wakefield; under flag of truce, evil rushed upon him, in the year [14]60, the 30th of December; he was fifty years old, as is recalled. Praying God and his most sweet Lady that his soul may rest in paradise. Amen.] Variants: Title ] om . AH. 1 En memoyre soit] om.

Keen, England in the Later Middle Ages: a Political History (1973), p. 456; and T.B.

Rowe (1986), p. 109. 3 The possibility that lines 25-28 in the other two manuscripts might represent a later insertion seems to be ruled out by the fact that the Harley 48 copy of the epitaph is itself immediately preceded by an account of the Fotheringhay reinterment—virtually conclusive evidence that this ceremony was the original occasion of the poem's composition. 4 There are three separate accounts of this ceremony, two in French (B.L., MSS. Harley 48, fols. 78 r -81 r , and Harley 4632, fols. 123 r -125 r ) and one in English (B.L., MS. Addit. 45131, fols. 23 v -24 r ); none has been printed in full. A detailed summary of the first is, however, to be found in Cora L. Scofield, The Life and Reign of Edward the Fourth , 2 vols. (1923), II: 167-168, while a less satisfactory paraphrase of the other two is in Francis Sandford, A Genealogical History of the Kings of England (1677), pp. 373-374. 5 B.L., MS. Addit. 45131, fol. 24 r . An inventory of the trappings of the hearse (College of Arms, MS. I. 11, fol. 188 v ) describes the image on the cloth as "o ur lord sytting on the dome"; cf. the Last Judgment painted by Rogier van der Weyden ( c. 1443-46) in the Hôtel-Dieu at Beaune, which shows Christ seated on a rainbow. 6 B.L., MS. Harley 48, fol. 81 r . Harley 4632 estimates "bien de quinze a seze [m] p er -sonnes Repues aux despens du Roy et y eust quarante pipes de vin [i.e. over five thousand gallons] partans du scellier du Roy celle Iournee" (fol. 125 r ). 7 R.H.

Harley 48, fol. 78 r and Harley 4632, fol. 125 r ). Anthony R. Wagner's suggestion ( Heralds and Heraldry in the Middle Ages , 2nd ed. [1956], p. 108, fn. 2) that the copyist of MS. Harley 48 was Richard Chester is unconvincing. 12 G.A.

An experienced officer of arms like Whiting, an eyewitness to the ceremony, would surely have been able to provide these names; on the other hand, if he were copying someone else's account after a lengthy interval, his memory might well have failed to supply them. 14 Anthony R.

      <field name="heading_text">More on the 1532 Edition of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso by Conor Fahy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In October 1986, after I had returned the corrected proofs of my note on the definitive edition of Ariosto's Orlando furioso (Ferrara, Francesco Rosso, 1532), published in Studies in Bibliography , vol. 40, 1 I was able to examine two further copies of this edition, in the library of the Musée Condé, Château de Chantilly, Chantilly (Oise), near Paris. 2 The Musée Condé was established by Henri-Eugène-Philippe-Louis d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale (1822-1897), fourth son of king Louis-Philippe of France; the library consists essentially of the duke's private collection, formed in the second half of the nineteenth century, mainly in England, during a period of exile following the Revolution of 1848. One of the new copies is printed on vellum. In the hand-written catalogue of printed books available for consultation in the library, which is based on notes made by the duke himself, it is stated that this copy was purchased in Berlin for the sum of 5,000 francs; in a note inserted in the volume, probably also compiled by the duke, the name of the bookseller is given as S. Calvary and the date of purchase 1877. On the title-page, and on the verso of the last leaf, there is a half-erased inscription, in which it is nevertheless still possible to read the words: ". . . Congregat. Oratorij Neapolis". This is enough to identify the copy as that which belonged to the Neapolitan intellectual Giuseppe Valletta (1636-1714), and which passed in 1727, with others of his books, to the Biblioteca Oratoriana of that city, where it figured in the old library catalogue, compiled before 1736, after which date it disappeared from view, and has not been identified since. With the four vellum copies included in the list appended to my note of 1987, we are now back at the figure of five surviving copies on vellum, originally claimed by Van Praet, but subsequently disputed by authorities on Ariosto, because of the disappearance of the Valletta copy. 3 Even more interesting and important is the second Chantilly copy, on paper, the inspection of which has enabled me to tie up several of the loose ends of my previous note. In the printed catalogue of early editions in the Musée Condé, compiled by Léopold Delisle, the copy is stated to be on large paper, and is implicitly identified with the large-paper copy owned in the nineteenth century by the Italian bibliophile Gaetano Melzi. 4 This identification is undoubtedly incorrect. The Melzi large-paper copy is no. 10 in my list; its pedigree is impeccable (the present owner's uncle bought it from Melzi's descendants), and it has a facsimile titlepage, as described by Melzi. Delisle was probably led astray by the fact, indicated in the duke's hand-written catalogue, that the Chantilly paper copy had formerly belonged to the English collector Frank Hall Standish, who bought some books from Melzi in 1821. These, however, were incunables and Aldine editions, which Melzi was disposing of to make room for the collection of editions of chivalric epics which he was planning to start; in any case, he did not buy the largepaper Furioso of 1532 until 1830 at the earliest. 5 Delisle was right, however, in describing the Chantilly copy as a largepaper one. The dimensions of the bottom and outer margins are almost identical with those of copy no. 10, and substantially greater than those of the copy in sheets, now in Verona. 6 Further, like copies 9 and 10, it has the cancellans of sheet inner A, and the corrected state of every forme, sharing with copy no. 9 the sole exception of having the incorrect state of the second round of correction in the inner forme of sheet inner G, whereas copy no. 10 has the correct state of both rounds. In the excellent conditions of light which obtained during my visit, I was able to distinguish the watermark of the paper used, a fleur-de-lys, with a countermark of a cross surmounting the letters C D. During a subsequent visit to Italy, I re-examined copies 9 and 10, and several others, with particular reference to the paper, and now present the results of this further work, which corrects and augments some of the findings published last year, with implications for two of the three heads under which I considered the printing of this edition, namely, the question of the cancelled sheet, and the existence of perfect copies. 7 Surviving paper copies of the 1532 Furioso can be divided into two groups, according to the paper used. The larger group, comprising sixteen copies (copies 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in my list) can conveniently be characterized as the anchor watermark group. In point of fact, the single most common paper used in this group (30 sheets, or almost 50 per cent, in the Verona copy, which, being still in sheets, permits easy and accurate examination of the paper) has no watermark at all, but almost all the other sheets have some version of the anchor watermark inscribed in a circle, surmounted by a further element, such as a star or a cross. 8 None of these papers has a countermark. The dimensions of the sheets of the Verona copy are approximately 44 X 32 cm, that is to say, foolscap size, what the medieval Italian paper trade called reçute . 9 All sixteen copies contain a variable number of formes in the incorrect state, and all sixteen belong to Debenedetti's Type I, that is, they have the cancellandum of inner A. The smaller group consists of three copies, copies 9 and 10 in my list and the paper copy at Chantilly. All three have the same paper, with the fleur-de-lys watermark and the cross and letter countermark, and this paper is used for every sheet. The Bologna copy (no. 9) has presumably been cropped; even so, the dimensions of its outer and bottom margins are slightly larger than the corresponding dimensions of the Verona copy. The outer and bottom margins of copy no. 10 and the Chantilly copy are consistently larger by several millimetres than the Verona copy measurements. Clearly, the fleur-de-lys paper is larger than the anchor papers, though it scarcely seems big enough to belong to the next traditional Italian size, that of mezane , approximately 51.5 by 34.5 cm. 10 All three copies have no formes in the incorrect state, except that, as has already been said, copy no. 9 and the Chantilly copy do not have the second round of correction, comprising one authorial variant, in the inner forme of sheet inner G. Finally, all three copies belong to Debenedetti's Type II, that is, they have the cancellans of sheet inner A. In addition to these two groups of paper copies, there is also a group of vellum copies, nos. 8, 11, 12 and 23 on my list, and the vellum copy at Chantilly. As I reported in my previous note (p. 76, n. 13), these copies were at first sometimes printed with the uncorrected state of the forme, but after gathering G they always have the correct state. The Chantilly copy, like copies 8, 12 and 23, has the cancellandum of sheet inner A; copy no. 11, the presentation copy for cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, son of the duke of Ferrara, thus remains the only surviving vellum copy to have the cancellans of this sheet. Using the evidence provided by this grouping of surviving copies according to the material on which they were printed, it is possible to draw some further conclusions about the printing of the edition. These conclusions, of course, like those advanced in my previous note, are subject to the limitations of the inductive reasoning on which they are based, limitations about which, after D.F. McKenzie's famous article in this journal in 1969, no bibliographer can be in any doubt. 11 McKenzie's salutary illustration of the dangers of over-confidence does not, however, lessen the fact that hypothetical conclusions based on inductive reasoning, and consisting of a judicious weighing of the available evidence, are the stuff of which historical reconstructions are made, and there can be no forward movement in historical knowledge without them. The following observations are advanced in this spirit, accompanied by the unwritten proviso: "unless further evidence emerges to the contrary". It seems that from the outset the printer of this edition, doubtless with the knowledge, indeed, probably on the instructions of, the author, distinguished in the printing of each forme between two sorts of paper copies, those, the majority (probably the vast majority), on unwatermarked or anchor-watermarked paper, and those, the minority (probably a small minority), on larger paper with the fleur-de-lys watermark, making sure that the latter never went through the press until after the correction of the forme, which, in this edition, as I argued in my note of last year, was a normal procedure. Only one hiccup seems to have occurred in this arrangement, in the inner forme of inner G, where the large-paper copies seem to have been actually on the press when printing was stopped to incorporate a second round of correction, in the form of a significant re-writing of a whole line (Canto XII, st. 85, l. 8, G6r a24 in the edition, from Sempre è in timore, e far contraria via to Teme, e di far sempre contraria via ). The disposition of copies in this variant—two of the large-paper copies, all the vellum copies and only two of the anchor paper copies with the incorrect state, and all the other copies, including fourteen anchor paper copies, with the correct state—shows that the large-paper copies did not necessarily go through the press at the very end of the press run of each forme. None the less, it is interesting that, from the start, more care was taken over the text which went into the large-paper copies than over that contained in the vellum copies. This care over the text of the large-paper copies is further emphasized by considering the other main difference between copies of this edition, the presence, in the large-paper copies, and in one of the five surviving vellum copies, of the cancellans of inner A. This contains, as I argued in my note of last year, the definitive text of the 78 stanzas in question. I commented: "One has to admit, however, that if Type II [the cancellans ] of sheet inner A was a cancel, intended to correct an oversight which had left some early pages of the text linguistically and stylistically disfigured, it was a very unsuccessful one. Of the twenty-four surviving copies listed in Appendix A only three contain the cancellans . I have no satisfactory explanation of why this should be so" (p. 82). The discovery of the Chantilly copy on paper now suggests the missing explanation. Unless and until a copy appears with the cancellans on anchor paper, we must assume that the cancel was never intended for such copies. While it seems to have been conceived of as applying to such of the vellum copies as had not already left the printing house, or the city, at the time of production (which must have been after all the rest of the edition had been printed), as far as paper copies were concerned it was a cancel for the large-paper group only. The vellum copies were clearly intended for Ariosto's masters and patrons; while considerable care was taken over the text, what mattered most here was the quality of the material. The anchor-paper copies, with their aleatory combination of corrected and uncorrected states, and the cancellandum of sheet inner A, were equally clearly meant for sale to the public. For whom were the large-paper copies designed? Adopting and expanding a suggestion of Debenedetti, I take this group of copies to have been planned ad usum auctoris et amicorum suorum , a readership expected to be fully capable of appreciating the nuances of style and language involved in the final corrections made to the text of Ariosto's work while it was printing. The qualitative difference in the paper used for the two groups of paper copies is not such as to exclude the possibility that the motive for using different paper for the smaller group was essentially practical, to aid the pressmen to recognize, by the size of the paper, the group of copies which they were on no account to put through the press, in the printing of each forme, until after there had been an opportunity for the correction of the type. It is tempting, or would have been to a previous generation of Renaissance scholars, to interpret the relegation of imperfect copies of the 1532 Furioso to the group intended for sale to the general public of readers as a sign of the aristocratic disdain of the court poet Ariosto, dedicated to "art for art's sake", for the approval of the common reader, whom he did not expect fully to understand his airy fantasies, and so was not concerned if they were presented to them in an imperfect text. I wonder, however, whether it is not more consistent with the disenchanted realism which we have now come to accept as a profounder characteristic of the "King of Court Poets" to suggest that the division of paper copies of the 1532 Furioso , as set out above, is simply a recognition by Ariosto both of the human error to be expected in the complex operation of bringing his long poem to print, and of the irrepressible nature of his desire to emend his text up to and beyond the last possible moment. 12 It is interesting to note that a somewhat similar division of copies occurred in the first printing, in 1528, of another Italian classic, Il libro del Cortegiano , by Baldassar Castiglione, though whether accompanied by significant textual differences nobody knows, since the edition in question, printed in Venice by the Aldine press, has not been subjected to bibliographical analysis. Castiglione, a Mantuan nobleman, was appointed Papal Nuncio to the emperor Charles V in 1524, and spent the rest of his life in Spain, dying there in 1529, so that he was not in Italy when his edition was published. In two letters to his steward he described the sort of edition he wanted, and gave instructions for the disposal of the copies. There were to be 1000 "ordinary" copies, plus thirty on "carta reale". He was to pay for 500 of the ordinary copies, plus all thirty of the second group; one hundred of the 500 ordinary copies belonging to him were to be retained for distribution to his friends, and the others sold in Italy through booksellers to recoup his expenses. The thirty copies on "carta reale" were presentation copies for Castiglione's patrons and his more distinguished friends, of whom he provided a list in his second letter (the king of France, the Pope, the duke and duchess of Mantua, etc.). In this letter he also enquired tentatively about a copy on vellum which his steward had asked the printer to prepare for him, if possible; modern scholars have suggested that this copy was intended for Charles V. While the vellum copy, if it ever existed, has not reappeared in modern times, copies of the 1528 Cortegiano on different sorts of paper certainly survive: in the British Library, the King's Library copy (pressmark: 31.g.9) is on larger and heavier paper than the Grenville copy (pressmark: G.2458), and is about twice as thick, though it has the same collational formula; it is presumably one of the thirty copies on "carta reale". 13 Finally, I would like to correct an error in my note of last year, which is relevant to my contention that Ariosto was presented with proofs of each forme or sheet of the 1532 Furioso . In my note (p. 80, n. 19) I stated that some autograph fragments of the material added to the 1532 Furioso had survived, but not the copy sent to the printers. In fact, among these fragments, as Debenedetti realised, there are indeed some leaves which served as printer's copy, comprising almost the whole of one of the additional episodes, the story of Olympia. The signs of the casting-off of copy are clearly visible, including erroneous calculations later corrected. 14 There are numerous differences between the text of these autograph pages and that printed in copies of the 1532 edition. Some of these, concerning abbreviations, capitalisation and punctuation, could be due to the compositor; but others involve linguistic and stylistic choices, similar to those displayed in many of the press-corrections in the volume, and in the cancellans of sheet inner A. The crucial cases are those relating to parts of the text carried on formes of the 1532 edition which are already known to have been press-corrected. As an example, I take the inner forme of sheet inner E. There are two press-variants in this forme, the uncorrected state, which I give first, being found in four anchor-type paper copies, against all the rest: E5v a34 Et fatto / E fatto ; and E5v b13 vn tempo data / vn tempo io data . The autograph manuscript has the reading of the uncorrected state in both these cases; elsewhere in the parts of the text corresponding to the pages of this forme it has some twenty linguistic and stylistic variants with respect to all surviving copies of the 1532 edition (e.g. Canto IX, st. 50, l. 1; E5v a17 in the edition: (autograph) Il padre: li fratelli / (edition) Mio padre, e miei fratelli ). 15 In these cases the change is clearly authorial, and since it is not the result of press-correction, it can only have been instigated during a previous process of proof-correction, which, if it was thought to be necessary for new material neatly set out in a clearly written manuscript, would a fortiori also be likely to be thought necessary for those parts of the text——the vast majority—where the exemplar was a copy of the 1521 edition heavily corrected.</field>

Van Praet, Catalogue de livres imprimés sur vélin, qui se trouvent dans des bibliothèques tant publiques que particulières (1824-28), II, 109-10, lists the location of the five copies as: "1. Dans la Bibl. Barberini, à Rome [copy no. 11 in my list]; 2. Dans celle de Vicence [copy no. 8]; 3. De M. le comte Garimberti à Parme [copy no. 12]; 4. De M. Giuseppe Valletta, à Naples [the Chantilly copy]; 5. Le cinquième a passé en Angleterre [presumably copy no. 23, brought to Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century by Giuseppe Baretti for the Irish peer James Caulfeild (1728-1799), fifth viscount and first earl of Charlemont; see C. Fahy, "L'esemplare già 'Charlemont' dell' Orlando furioso del 1532", Lettere italiane , 14 (1962), 441-450]". The major Italian bibliography of the chivalric epic, however, gives only four vellum copies, conflating Van Praet's fourth and fifth copies; see [G. Melzi], Bibliografia dei romanzi e poemi cavallereschi italiani; seconda edizione corretta ed accresciuta (1838), 117. 4 See [L. Delisle], Chantilly: le Cabinet des Livres: imprimés antérieurs au milieu du xvie siècle (1905), 28. 5 For Standish's library, see Chantilly: le Cabinet des Livres , xxii-xxxii. Standish, a Francophile, bequeathed his collection to the king of France. His books passed to the duc d'Aumale on the death of Louis Philippe in 1850. For the acquisition by Melzi not earlier than 1830 of a large-paper copy with facsimile title-page, see G. Melzi-P. A. Tosi, Bibliografia dei romanzi di cavalleria in versi e in prosa italiani (1865), 38-39. 6 On this copy, see now C. Fahy, "A Copy in Sheets of the Orlando furioso of 1532", La Bibliofilia , 88 (1986), 189-193. 7 For the convenience of readers who may not have vol. 40 of Studies in Bibliography to hand, the 1532 Furioso is a quarto in eights, collating A-Z 8 , a-h 8 ; it has nearly 300 press-variants, disposed from beginning to end of the volume, and affecting three-quarters of the formes required to print the text, and there is a cancel involving the inner sheet of gathering A. 8 See "A Copy in Sheets of the Orlando furioso of 1532", 191-193, and n. 10. A further visit to Verona has slightly altered my appraisal of the watermark situation in that copy. I now think that four, not two, different versions of the anchor mark inscribed in a circle are represented in its paper, the two new marks both having two barbs on the anchor fluke, not one; one of the new marks is surmounted by a six-pointed star, the other by a three-petalled flower. In addition, there is a hat watermark in both sheets of the final gathering, so reducing the number of unwatermarked sheets from 32 to 30. There are thus six different identifiable types of paper represented in this copy, and I have found a seventh, watermarked with the letters N B inscribed in a circle, in one sheet only of two other anchor paper copies. Doubtless the unwatermarked paper and all the anchor papers were part of the 400 reams that Ariosto bought from Salò for the printing of this edition (see SB , 40 [1987], 75, and n. 10). The anchor inscribed in a circle was a widely used watermark in Italy; the version with a single barb is Venetian, and so is the hat; see C. M. Briquet, Les filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier dès leur apparition vers 1282 jusqu'en 1600. A Facsimile of the 1907 Edition with Supplementary Material by a Number of Scholars (1968), I, 40-41; 222-223; and marks 588-589; 592; 484, 493; 544; 3401-08. 9 Briquet, Les filigranes , I, 2-4. 10 Briquet, loc. cit. The mark found in the 1532 Furioso is similar to a group of sixteenth-century Venetian marks illustrated in Briquet (7280-7302), though none of these has a countermark. 11 D. F. McKenzie, "Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices", SB , 22 (1969), 1-75. 12 Despite the fact that it is reasonable to hypothesize the existence in this edition of three subgroups of copies, each with a different destination, I do not think there are any grounds for describing them as separate issues of the edition. The identity of the sub-groups was apparent to the printers and to the author, and their destination was known to the latter, and possibly also to the former. But none of this information was displayed on the copies, or otherwise made explicit, except in so far as the material on which they were printed of itself differentiated them in the eyes of users. Nor are the subgroups entirely discrete as bibliographical units: as has already been said, there is one incorrect state in some copies of the large-paper group, and the vellum group has both cancellandum and cancellans of sheet inner A. 13 Castiglione's letters to his steward, Cristoforo Tiraboschi, were published in an English translation by J. Cartwright, Baldassare Castiglione, the Perfect Courtier: his Life and Letters 1478-1529 (1908), II, 373-378. The Italian text was published in 1851, from originals which have remained in private hands. The appearance of the relevant volume of the critical edition of Castiglione's correspondence, now in course of publication, may help to resolve several small problems caused by the 1851 text and Julia Cartwright's translation. Another large-paper copy belonged to the Trivulzio family (Margherita Trivulzia, contessa della Somaglia, was one of the distinguished friends mentioned in Castiglione's second letter), and is now presumably in the Biblioteca Trivulziana, Milan; see A. A. Renouard, Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde, ou Histoire des trois Manuce et de leurs éditions; troisième édition (1834), 105. In Italian, "reale", applied to paper, normally has the same meaning as the English "royal". However, the large-paper copies of the Cortegiano are certainly not on paper of the size normally designated as "royal". Unfortunately, satisfactory documentation of the precise meaning, or meanings, of the terminology of printing and allied crafts in Renaissance Italy is singularly lacking. 14 A facsimile edition of the greater part of these fragments, which are now in the Biblioteca Comunale Ariostea, Ferrara, was published in 1904 by G. Agnelli (L. Ariosto, I Frammenti autografi dell' "Orlando Furioso "); two further leaves of the fair copy of the Olympia episode, which had become separated from the main part of this section long ago, and are now in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, were published in facsimile in the same year by G. Lisio, "Autografi ariosteschi", in Da Dante al Leopardi: raccolta di scritti critici, di ricerche storiche, filologiche e letterarie, con facsimili e tavole, per le Nozze di Michele Scherillo con Teresa Negri (1904), 387-390. All the fragments were edited with introduction and notes by S. Debenedetti in 1937. 15 I have been rigorous in including in my count only variants which cannot reasonably be attributed to anyone else but the author. The total number of variants between the manuscript and the printed edition in this forme, excluding those involving abbreviations, which were very common both in written and in printed Italian in the first half of the sixteenth century, is 131.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"Foul Papers" and "Prompt-Books": Printer's Copy For Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors by Paul Werstine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is received opinion among late twentieth-century editors that printer's copy for Comedy of Errors , first printed in the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, was Shakespeare's "foul papers" as annotated (sparsely) by a bookkeeper. According to G. Blakemore Evans, for example: "the manuscript behind the F1 [First Folio] text seems to have been some form of Shakespeare's autograph, probably his 'foul papers.' There is also perhaps some slight evidence of a book-keeper's hand in a few stage directions. . . . That the manuscript could ever have served as a prompt-book, however, seems highly unlikely, because there is a good deal of confusing variety, ambiguity, and inconsistency in the form of the speech-prefixes, and Luce [the 'Kitchen wench'] is once referred to as Nel, Luciana as Juliana." 1 This view had been developed by E. K. Chambers and W. W. Greg in opposition to J. Dover Wilson's complex theory of a text assembled from actors' parts (with reference to a plat or plot) and then revised. 2 The Chambers-Greg position has been challenged only once, and then only in part. R. A. Foakes, editor of the new Arden edition (1962), attempted to trace to Shakespeare's manuscript and to the printing house the few errors and duplications that Chambers and Greg assigned to the theatrical annotator (pp. xiii-xv). I find Foakes's argument convincing and believe that it can be further developed. I shall argue that the Chambers-Greg identification of copy as annotated "foul papers" has never been effectively demonstrated, that the evidence for it has been eroded by study of the printing of the Folio, and that its final articulation by Greg in the Shakespeare First Folio , which most subsequent editors have almost slavishly imitated, misrepresents what he himself has taught us about theatrical manuscripts in Dramatic Documents of the Elizabethan Playhouses (2 vols., 1931). I believe that Comedy of Errors exemplifies the following generalization recently offered by Professor Bowers concerning "what Greg called 'the general character' of the manuscript from which a Shakespeare print was made": "So important is the subject for one's total information about the text that almost every editor these days feels it incumbent to discuss the question at some length in his introduction. I must say, however, that except in a few clearcut cases the evidence is subject to such varying interpretation and in its history has had such reversals of opinion . . . that insufficiently rigorous standards have governed the usual discussion and little conviction may result." 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I As always, Greg sought clues to the nature of the underlying manuscript in the stage directions of the printed text. But when, like Greg, one addresses the stage directions of Comedy of Errors with questions about whether their origin is authorial or theatrical, one finds that they offer divided testimony. Some provide information essential to a reader, but not strictly necessary to the book-holder in an acting company: ' Enter Adriana, wife to Antipholis Sereptus, with Luciana her Sister' ; ' Enter Adriana . . . and a Schoolemaster, call'd Pinch' (TLN 273-274, 1321-22). 4 These may have been written by the author with a view to guiding his company through the play when he first read it to them, or they may have been directed either by the author or some other agent (perhaps a Folio "editor") toward a post-production reading audience. Another of the directions is indefinite in its reference to the number of actors taking part in a scene: ' Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him: Hee strives ' (TLN 1394-95). Now this, we might think, is almost certainly authorial, for it compares closely to authorial directions in the extant dramatic manuscripts The Book of Sir Thomas More ('Enter [t]hree or foure Prentises of trades' [Malone Society Reprint (1911), l. 453]) and The Launching of the Mary ('Enter Lo. Ad: [Lord Admiral] wth .2. or .3. attendant es ' [Malone Society Reprint (1933), l. 1216]). Yet such comparison is possible only because the manuscript directions survived transmission through the hands of theatrical book-keepers; both More and Launching are listed as "prompt-books" by Greg himself ( Dramatic Documents I, 243-251, 300-305). Thus even though the call for 'three or foure' in Comedy of Errors may originate with the author, its appearance in the printed text does not necessarily rule out the possibility that printer's copy was a theatrical manuscript, rather than the author's "foul papers." A third kind of stage direction in Comedy of Errors names properties that may have been of interest to a book-keeper and so perhaps suggests his hand, although these directions, too, may well be authorial, since Shakespeare was so familiar with the needs of the stage: ' Enter Angelo with the Chaine '; ' Enter Dromio Eph. with a ropes end '; ' Enter Antipholus Siracusia with his Rapier drawne, and Dromio Sirac ' (TLN 955, 1288, 1440-41). On the whole, the stage directions in Errors offer no decisive evidence for editorial identification of printer's copy either as an authorial manuscript or as a theatrical playbook. 5 There are certainly authorial touches, but these could have been transferred to a playbook. As Greg wrote in Dramatic Documents of the Elizabethan Playhouses , "It is time we asked the question: What treatment did the book-keeper mete out to the author's stage-directions? The answer is that as a rule he left them alone" (I, 213).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In quest of the nature of printer's copy for Errors we must then turn, to quote Evans again, to the "variety, ambiguity, and inconsistency" in the naming of characters in the stage directions and speech prefixes. What chiefly separates us from Greg in evaluating these is the detailed reconstruction of the printing of the Folio that Hinman has provided and that has been modified by subsequent investigation. 6 The most significant part of this bibliographical project, for our purposes, has been the discrimination of three compositors at work on Folio Errors and the identification of their pages and columns. The order in which the pages were printed and the stints of the three typesetters are as follows: Compositor Page or Col. TLNs Act, scene, line 7 D H3v 616-742 III.i.1-81 (Hinman, Howard-Hill, Werstine) C H4a 743-808 III.i.82-III.ii.22 (Howard-Hill) D H4b 809-874 III.ii.23-83 C H3a 486-549 II.ii.92-154 (Howard-Hill) D H3b 550-615 II.ii.155-219 B H4v 875-997 III.ii.84-IV.i.15 C H2v 354-485 II.i.78-II.ii.91 (Howard-Hill) B H5 998-1127 IV.i.16-IV.ii.21 D H2a 230-288 I.ii.65-II.i.14 C H2b 289-353 II.i.15-77 (Howard-Hill) D most of H5v 1128-1234 IV.ii.22-IV.iii.51 C lower H5vb 1235-1254 IV.iii.52-71 (O'Connor) C H1va 100-164 I.i.97-I.ii.2 (Howard-Hill) D H1vb 165-229 I.ii.3-64 B H6 1255-1381 IV.iii.72-IV.iv.93 C H1 1-99 I.i.1-96 (Howard-Hill) B H6v 1382-1503 IV.iv.94-V.i.37 B I2v 1889-end V.i.400-end B I1v 1631-1760 V.i.159-282 B I2 1761-1888 V.i.283-399 B I1 1504-1630 V.i.38-158 As a general rule, one can trace to copy inconsistencies that are found in the work of more than one of the compositors—for example, the failure, on all but a few occasions, to distinguish between the speech prefixes for the two Antipholi until both are onstage at the same time. By the obverse of the same rule, inconsistencies that are concentrated in the work of just a single compositor need not be attributed to copy, unless the compositor was demonstrably incapable of introducing them himself; an example is Compositor B's apparent refusal to distinguish between the speech prefixes of the two Dromios, in contrast with the regularity with which both Compositor C and Compositor D maintained the distinction. Most—but by no means all—of the inconsistency in Errors probably does derive from printer's copy, although editors have exaggerated its quantity and seriousness to support Greg's position that printer's copy cannot have been a playbook. Four major characters (the Antipholi and the Dromios) and six minor ones are affected. Antipholus of Siracusa is called ' Antipholis Erotes ' or ' Antipholis Errotis ' in stage directions until the scene now numbered III.ii, when he becomes ' Antipholus of Siracusia '. Antipholus of Ephesus is called ' Antipholis Sereptus ' in the opening stage direction of II.i, but thereafter becomes ' Antipholus of Ephesus '. Neither the use of Latinate epithets nor the spelling Antipholis is compositorial, for Compositors C and D each used both spellings— Antipholis and Antipholus —and both kinds of naming. 8 As editor after editor has shown (however inadvertently), it is easy to overemphasize the ambiguity arising from this variety in naming. 9 Indeed no ambiguity at all could have arisen in the theatre from the naming of Antipholus of Ephesus as 'Sereptus' in the opening stage direction of II.i because he does not even enter in this scene—Adriana, who does enter, is merely being identified, superfluously from a theatrical point of view, as ' wife to Antipholis Sereptus ' (TLN 273). The only ambiguity that a book-keeper might have encountered would be in determining whether the character called, in the printed text, 'Antipholis Errotis' or 'Erotes' who occupies the stage for most of the first two acts is to be identified as 'Antipholus of Siracusa' or as 'Antipholus of Ephesus', each of whom must get on stage and off during the last three acts. But the extent to which this particular inconsistency would even have been a problem for a putative book-keeper is difficult to determine. We now have only the opaquely corrupt Latin 'Errotis' and 'Erotes'—both spellings obviously errors and probably Compositor C's, if not a scribe's—for whatever Shakespeare may have originally written. 10 A putative book-keeper may well have had the correct Latin before him, which may have designated the character in question in a quite unambiguous way. In spite of the corrupt Latin in the Folio, no editor has ever had any difficulty associating Antipholus 'Errotis' with Antipholus of 'Siracusa'. This association is enforced by an important theatrical consideration, the so-called "law of reentry"; the 'Antipholis Errotis' who exits with Luciana and Adriana at the end of Act Two cannot be the 'Antipholus of Ephesus' who enters with Angelo and Balthaser at the beginning of Act Three. It may be dangerous for editors to assume that they have so much more expertise in interpreting theatrical texts than did the companies who performed them. Yet editors make just such an assumption when they assert that printer's copy for Folio Errors cannot have been a playbook because of such a minor ambiguity—and one that may well have been compounded or even introduced only when the play was printed. Whatever the terms of the distinction, the Antipholi are distinguished from each other in stage directions for their entrances by all three compositors. There are only two exceptions; these are Compositor B's only attempts to reproduce the entrances together of Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant Dromio of Ephesus: ' Enter Antipholus Ephes. Dromio from the Courtizans '; ' Enter Antipholus, and E. Dromio of Ephesus ' (TLN 995, 1665). Neither attempt is quite satisfactory, the first hanging the modifier 'Ephes.' between the names it may modify, the second leaving Antipholus unmodified and duplicating the modification of Dromio. Since both directions were set by a single workman, he is the likely source of such confusion, which therefore can hardly be taken to indicate the nature of his copy; the other two compositors, who presumably used comparable printer's copy, did manage, after all, invariably to reproduce unambiguous entrances for the Antipholi, and so did Compositor B on all but two occasions. But in the speech prefixes the Antipholi are rarely distinguished from each other until they meet for the first time in the last scene. Then Compositor B, who alone set type for the last scene, invariably used ' E. Ant .' for Antipholus of Ephesus and ' S. Ant .' for Antipholus of Siracusa. There are two reasons why we cannot credit B in this scene with imposing the necessary distinction on the prefixes: never before in the play did Compositor B attain anything close to consistency in preserving a distinction between the Antipholi in speech prefixes—what a compositor fails to do in one place he can hardly be credited with doing in another; and furthermore, earlier in the play, the distinction is occasionally found not only on B's pages, but also on those of his fellow compositor, D—what is common to the pages of two different compositors would seem more likely to derive from copy than from the independent intervention of two different typesetters. 11 Indeed it is quite impossible to attribute to Compositor D addition of the initial E to the five E. An(t)(ti). speech prefixes that he set in the first column of page H3v because this was the first column of the play on which he worked, and so he could not have known yet that there were two different characters both named Antipholus , between whom it might be necessary to make a distinction. So it would appear that copy occasionally made a distinction between the Antipholi in speech prefixes even when it was not strictly necessary to do so, and that copy maintained a consistent distinction between the speech prefixes of the two characters on the only occasion that matters in the theatre, the occasion when they are on stage at the same time in the play's last scene. What editors display as a most serious ambiguity in printer's copy is the single instance very early in the play (TLN 409) when Antipholus of Siracusa is designated by the speech prefix ' E. Ant. ', the speech heading later associated only with Antipholus of Ephesus. It is more likely, however, that Compositor C introduced this form under the influence of the name Antipholis Errotis that he had seen in the stage direction he had last set into type (TLN 394), and so this anomalous speech prefix cannot be assumed to derive from copy. 12 Compositor C was the only compositor to encounter in stage directions the Latinate form that he reproduced as Errotis or Erotes and the only one to typeset a speech prefix for Antipholus of Siracusa as E. Ant. ; anyone who wished to trace the speech prefix to copy would have to dismiss this conjunction of evidence as mere coincidence. 13 Whereas the lack of any consistent distinction between the Antipholi in speech prefixes until absolutely necessary in the last scene probably originates with printer's copy, failures to distinguish between the Dromios in speech prefixes are comparatively rare, and most of them probably compositorial in origin. Dromio of Ephesus is always identified as such in entrance directions; Dromio of Siracusa is merely Dromio only twice in entrance directions (TLN 162, 1476). The first lapse is probably Shakespeare's, since it involves the character's first entrance in the play , but, in the order of printing , it involves the second and last entrance set for him by Compositor C, who had previously used the unambiguous designation Dromio Siracusia (TLN 401). The second lapse is hardly a lapse at all: ' Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe ' (TLN 1476) must refer to the Siracusian pair who had left the stage only a dozen or so lines above (TLN 1461). Two of the Folio compositors almost invariably distinguished between the Dromios in speech prefixes, using ' S. Dro. ' and ' E. Dro. ' (' Dromio.', 'Drom.', 'Dr. '). Compositor C's pages contain thirty-five examples of these forms, Compositor D's forty-eight. Compositor C omitted the distinguishing initial only three times, Compositor D five times. In numerical terms then these two compositors maintained the distinction 91% of the time. Compositor C's three omissions form a sequence at the end of II.i that stretches from the bottom of column H2b into the top of column H2va (TLN 352, 355, 358). Earlier in this scene, in column H2b, Compositor C set ' E. Dro. ' six times (TLN 320, 324, 328, 333, 335, 347). Since column H2va was already in type before the compositor turned to column H2b, the sequence of omissions does not correspond to the sequence of his typesetting, and so he was probably not responsible for the omissions. It would seem instead that Shakespeare never bothered to include the distinguishing initials for Dromio of Ephesus' last three speeches in this scene, and that Compositor C merely followed copy. Five times in Compositor D's pages a speech is headed simply ' Dro .' Three times the omission of distinguishing initials on Compositor D's pages may have been caused by justification of long lines. The most convincing example concerns the last speech prefix that Compositor D set at the bottom of column H4b (TLN 872; see Fig. 1); here the first line of the speech is so tightly set that there is much less white space to the left and to the right of the speech prefix than is ordinarily found in D's work, and no room for the usual initial. Although the first line of Dromio of Siracusa's penultimate speech in the same column is much more generously spaced, the suspicion still may arise that Compositor D again left out the S in order to justify the line (TLN 868; see Fig. 1). A third instance of Dro. alone as a prefix in a long line occurs immediately after the entrance of ' S. Dromio ' near the top of the first column of page H5v (TLN 1136; see Fig. 2). Since, as I will discuss later, there is a possibility that speech prefixes were sometimes omitted from copy immediately after such entrances, perhaps Compositor D alone was responsible for the choice of the form Dro. here—a choice that he may have taken when he came to justify the line. In two other cases, however, Compositor D may have reflected copy in setting Dro. alone as a speech head; neither of these instances displays any evidence that the exigencies of typesetting interfered with the faithful replication of copy forms (TLN 179, 550). Printer's copy may not then have been perfectly consistent in distinguishing between the Dromios in speech prefixes—only nearly perfect, to judge by the work of Compositors C and D. The longstanding editorial impression that printer's copy was far from perfect in this regard is based primarily then on Compositor B's pages. Until the last scene, when the appearance of the Dromios onstage together makes distinction mandatory and when Compositor B scrupulously maintained the distinction, his pages contain only eighteen examples of the initials S and E in speech prefixes for the Dromios, compared to thirty instances of Dro. alone. That is, Compositor B made the distinction only 38% of the time, in sharp contrast to Compositor C and D's 91%. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the breakdown of the distinction in the printed text merely reflects a comparable breakdown in copy for the last half of the play, which was chiefly the work of Compositor B alone. But B's stint overlaps those of C and D, B having set pages H4v-5 and 6-6v, C and D having shared page H5v. While on pages H4v-5, Compositor B maintained the distinction only three of a possible twenty-three times, Compositors C and D kept it up eighteen of nineteen times on page H5v—the single exception on TLN 1136 probably arising, as has already been noted, from a lack of space for the initial S in a long line. It seems likely then that whoever wrote what became printer's copy for the Folio was, with isolated exceptions such as I.ii and the end of II.i, generally careful to distinguish the Dromios, but his care had little effect on Compositor B. Printer's copy seems to have been much less consistent in the naming of five of the six minor characters whose names editors have cited as evidence that Folio Errors is based on "foul papers." It is true that none of the alleged confusion surrounding these five can be compositorial in origin, but again editors may have overstated the difficulties. (1) Egeon is never called by his proper name in either stage directions or speech prefixes. Yet in both his entrances, he does appear under the same unambiguous designation—' the Merchant of Siracusa '; he is ' Marchant ', ' Mer. ', or ' Merch. ' in the speech prefixes of the play's first scene, and first ' Mar. Fat. ' (Marchant Father) and then simply ' Fa. ' or ' Fath. ' in the speech prefixes of the last scene (TLN 2, 4, 30, 35, 101, 127, 160, 1599, 1671, 1761, 1771). The shifts in his speech prefixes do not, however, produce further ambiguity in the designation of speakers; instead they serve, in the play's final scene, to distinguish Egeon from the nameless 'Merchant' who is also a speaker in this scene. (2) A second minor character enters as ' Angelo the Goldsmith ' and ' Angelo ' in Act Three, but simply as ' Goldsmith ' twice in Acts Four and Five (TLN 617, 955, 981, 1466). His speeches are prefixed ' Angelo. ' or ' Ang. ' during his initial appearance, but in Acts Four and Five the prefix becomes ' Gold. ' (TLN 715, 783, 956-972, 988-1071, 1467-1869). There is no other goldsmith in the play, however, and no other Angelo; here we have some inconsistency in naming but no ambiguity. (3, 4) A third minor character, the ' Marchant ' who speaks to Antipholus of Siracusa in I.ii as ' Mer. ' (Compositor C's preference, TLN 163) or ' E. Mar. ' (D's preference, TLN 187, 195), is in no way distinguished from a fourth character, the ' Merchant ' who speaks in the last two acts set by Compositors B and D (TLN 981, 982, 1038, 1045, 1056, 1466 and so on). But it is so obvious that the two characters cannot be the same that no one before Alexander Dyce in his 1857 edition saw the ambiguity as serious enough to warrant editorial interference. (5) Three names are used for the 'Kitchen wench' ('Luce', 'Nell', and 'Dowsabell'), but on her single entrance she is invariably called ' Luce ' both in the stage direction and in the speech prefixes (TLN 679-704). Since the names Nell and Dowsabell are found only in dialogue references to her when she is not onstage, one wonders why her various names have ever been cited by textual critics as a reason that printer's copy could not have been a theatrical manuscript, since this inconsistency has no bearing on performance (TLN 900, 1099). 14 (6) Finally, a sixth variant name arising from the substitution of ' Juliana ' for Luciana in column H4a (TLN 786-787) is almost certainly compositorial. Compositor C probably misread ' Luciana ' on seeing it for the first time here in the first column of the play that he set into type. From the inconsistencies just recorded, Greg, in The Shakespeare First Folio , drew what I believe is too strict a conclusion: "since it is difficult to believe that the confusion in the character names and prefixes would have been tolerated in a prompt-book, it would seem that the manuscript [behind Folio Errors ] was most likely foul papers" (pp. 201-202).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III To evaluate Greg's categorical statement we need to summarize the "confusion" in Errors that cannot be discounted as a probable consequence of printing and compare it to what can be observed in the manuscripts that Greg himself designated "prompt-books." The most serious confusion in the copy for Errors seems to have been the variant identification of Antipholus of Siracusa, first, only with Latinate epithets (corrupted to 'Errotis' or 'Erotes' in the Folio) and, then, only with the place-name 'Siracusa'—different designations for the same character. A far less serious example of the same thing arises with the variants ' Angelo the Goldsmith ', ' Angelo ', and ' Goldsmith ' in entrance directions. Yet neither of these compares to what we find in the manuscript of Thomas Heywood's The Captives , one of Greg's "prompt-books" (Malone Society Reprint [1953]). There a figure enters three times under the clear designation 'Lord de Averne' but comes on a fourth time as simply 'the knight' in an entrance direction (ll. 869-870, 1306, 1721, 2464). But the theatrical annotator of Heywood's manuscript would apparently have been satisfied with even less uniformity and specificity than Heywood offered: when the annotator recopied the direction for de Averne's first entrance, placing it in the left margin for greater visibility, he reduced the name to a simple 'Lo:' (l. 868). The same play has what may be a single character named 'gripus the ffishermann', as he is called when he enters at line 2850 (compare ' Angelo the Goldsmith '). Yet the various names of this figure are so problematic that Arthur Brown, who edited the manuscript for the Malone Society, had to reserve judgment about Gripus's identity (p. xiv). Gripus may or may not be one of the '2 ffishermen' who enter at line 904; he does seem to be 'the ffishermann' whose appearance is called for at line 1907. In this context, the variable designations of Antipholus of Siracusa and Angelo the Goldsmith in Errors would scarcely forbid us from thinking that Folio copy may have been a theatrical manuscript. Nor would the use of the generic name ' the Merchant of Siracusa ' for Egeon in entrance directions. In Errors and in Greg's "prompt-books" characters also enter under designations that could apply just as well to other characters in the same plays. Dromio of Siracusa is simply ' Dromio ', also his brother's name, when he first enters. The two different merchants in Errors each enter as ' a Merchant ' or ' Marchant '; nevertheless, it would require a concerted effort to mix them up since one is found only in the play's first scene and then only in the company of Antipholus of Siracusa and the other, on both his appearances in the last two acts, in the company of Angelo the Goldsmith. In the playbook Edmond Ironside there are two Archbishops, Canterbury and York (Malone Society Reprint [1928]). The latter does not make an appearance until the beginning of Act Three; there was little effort expended then to distinguish Canterbury from York until that time. Although Canterbury is called 'Archbishope of Canterburye' in the first direction for his entrance, the next time he is just 'Arch: Bish:' and the next 'ArchB' (see the entrance directions in ll. 1, 385, and 564); on these occasions, he appears only in the company of Canutus. When the two Archbishops appear together in Act Three, and thereafter, they are always distinguished from each other by name. There is no more need to distinguish Canterbury from York when he appears alone in the first two acts of Edmond Ironside than there is to specify which of the nameless merchants enters in Errors , since in both cases the characters' identities are established by the groups in which they appear; Antipholus of Siracusa has his merchant, Angelo his; in Edmond Ironside , Canutus has his archbishop (Canterbury). To grant the possibility that printer's copy for Folio Errors could be a "prompt-book," Greg requires that it display a level of gratuitous precision in the identification of characters that exceeds that found in an extant "prompt-book" which is thoroughly representative of that class of manuscript. The same is true of Greg's implicit demand for uniform and distinctive speech prefixes for each character throughout a printed text before he will allow printer's copy to be a "prompt-book." The frequent use of Ant. for both the Antipholi until they appear together in the last scene, the occasional use of Dro. for one or the other of the Dromios on their separate entrances, the use of Mer. for Egeon in the first scene, for Antipholus of Siracusa's merchant in the second, and for Angelo's merchant in the last two acts all sink Folio Errors below Greg's expectations. So do the variant speech prefixes for Egeon— Mer. , Mar. Fat. , and Fath . But some speech prefixes in Greg's "prompt-books" are themselves neither uniform nor distinctive. In Henry Glapthorne's The Lady Mother , the steward Alexander Lovell speaks as 'Lo:' (or simply 'L:') until line 1919, after which, in violation of any principle of uniformity, 'Alex:' is used for the rest of the play (Malone Society Reprint [1959]). In John a Kent and John a Cumber , the speech prefix Iohn is always used for John a Kent, even when he shares the stage with John a Cumber (Malone Society Reprint [1923]). This is hardly an example of the use of distinctive speech prefixes in "prompt-books." Nor are "prompt-book" speech heads necessarily uniform even within a single scene. In The Lady Mother , Sir Hugh speaks both as 'Sr Hu:' and as 'Re:' for Recorder (ll. 2204-2570), a shift much harder to follow than Egeon's change from Mar. Fat. to Fath . In a "prompt-book" we might expect at a minimum to find clear distinctions among speech prefixes when the characters to which they refer are onstage at the same time, but such is often not the case. For example, an entrance direction in The Launching of the Mary calls for the presence of '1.2.' committeemen—presumably it means "committeeman 1 and committeeman 2" (l. 142). In the scene that follows this entrance direction, some speeches are prefixed 'Com: I.', but others, including two very long ones, are headed 'Com:' or 'Committ:'—a heading that could designate either one of the committeemen (ll. 216, 255, 278, 280, 284, 349). Similar ambiguity in speech prefixes arises in The Captives in a passage beginning with an entrance direction calling for the appearance of three women, 'Ashburne . . . his wyffe. Palestra Scribonia. . . .' The first speech prefix employed in this scene is the thoroughly ambiguous 'woman', which can be seen to refer, only upon examination of the speech and the reply to it, to Ashburne's wife. No such problems obtrude in Folio Errors , which can therefore be said to exhibit, in some respects, a clarity in the designation of characters that surpasses what is to be found in extant "prompt-books." By 1955, when Greg published The Shakespeare First Folio , he seems to have forgotten how much inconsistency was tolerated in playbooks. His judgment of the possibility of theatrical provenance for the manuscript behind Errors in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942) seems closer to the mark: "the text is generally clean, and at this early date it is particularly dangerous to dogmatize. Perhaps a tolerably careful author's copy may have been made to serve on the stage with a minimum of editing" (p. 140).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Although Greg came to believe by 1955 that printer's copy for Errors could not have been a playbook, he continued to argue, following Chambers, that copy contained annotations by a book-keeper. In early formulations of this argument, both Greg and Chambers had relied upon slight evidence of (1) duplication and contradiction in three stage directions and (2) discrepancies in the spellings and forms of characters' names between the initial speech prefix in a scene and later prefixes. The first of the discrepancies in speech prefixes they cited is found at TLN 163, where the initial speech prefix for the Merchant is ' Mer. ', although later in the scene he is called ' E. Mar. ' The other two such anomalies affect Dromio of Siracusa's entrances at TLN 1073-74 and TLN 1135-36. In each case, his first speech, to be delivered immediately upon his entrance, is prefixed by ' Dro. ', but the rest of his speeches in each scene are prefixed by ' S. Dro .' Greg reasoned that since, in the Folio, speech prefixes were twice omitted after entrances of single characters who spoke as soon as they came onstage (TLN 1183, 1641), then Shakespeare habitually omitted speech prefixes immediately after entrances. The omissions were then, in Greg's opinion, repaired by a book-keeper whose hand can be traced through the discrepancies in forms and spellings. Greg may well have been right to argue that Shakespeare omitted some speech prefixes, but there is no need to invoke a book-keeper to account for the variant forms ' Mer. ' and ' E. Mar. ' or ' Dro. ' and ' S. Dro. ' The Mer. / E. Mar. variants seem to be merely compositorial. Compositor C set the entrance direction ' Enter Antipholis Erotes, a Marchant, and Dromio ' near the bottom of his column H1va. He also set the prefix ' Mer. ' immediately after the entrance; whether he copied the prefix or supplied it in its absence from copy we cannot know. Compositor D, however, was the one who set column H1vb, which contains the only two other speeches by this merchant, both prefixed ' E. Mar. ' Since the variant forms were set into type by two different workmen, it would be superfluous to invoke two different hands in the copy as well—one the author's, the other the book-keeper's—merely to account for the variants. In the other two cases ( Dro., S. Dro. ), the discrepancies very probably did result from omission of speech prefixes after entrances, but the omissions could have been repaired by the compositors—there is no need to postulate a book-keeper's hand in the transmission of the play. 15 By 1942 Greg had abandoned, without explanation, this half of his case for a book-keeper's hand in the copy for Errors and had come to rely solely upon the errors and contradictions in three stage directions. He suggested that the book-keeper added ' Exeunt omnes ' to the stage direction at TLN 1898-99 to produce the contradiction: ' Exeunt omnes. Manet the two Dromio's and two Brothers '. However, such contradictory stage directions appear in plays identified by Greg as set from "foul papers" that could not be demonstrated to have passed through a book-keeper's hands. Foakes has cited parallels from 3 Henry VI (' Exeunt. | Manet Richard .' TLN 1646-47) and Coriolanus (' Exeunt | Manet the Guard and Menenius .' TLN 3329-30), and even closer parallels are to be found in the first quarto of Titus Andronicus , in which the stage direction ' Exeunt Omnes ' (TLN 374) is contradicted by Titus' remaining on stage, and in the Folio Antony and Cleopatra with ' Exit omnes . | Manet Enobarbus, Agrippa, Mecenas ' (TLN 880-881). The second stage direction cited by Greg as evidence of a book-keeper's annotations is split between the two columns of page H6v. The bottom of column H6va reads, ' Runne all out ', a direction repeated in part in the second line of H6vb: ' Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted ' (TLN 1445-47). Greg blamed the book-keeper for the alleged duplication, but Foakes offered an alternative explanation: The fact that the passage . . . is split between the foot of one column and the top of another needs to be taken into account; it may be that the author wrote one direction in the right margin of his manuscript, but divided it because of its length into two lines, 'Runne all out / as fast as may be, frighted,' then, in the accident of printing, and of the division between columns, the direction was split into two and attached to different lines. If so, the 'Exeunt omnes' could be the compositor's addition to make sense of 'as fast as may be, frighted'. (pp. xiv-xv) The first half of this apparently split stage direction appears in the direction line of the first column. Since no other stage direction in the Folio Comedies section is located in the direction line, it would appear that Compositor B was ready to take extraordinary measures to avoid setting a marginal stage direction at the top of a column. For this reason, he would not have completed the direction begun at the bottom of column H6va with the top line of column H6vb. That is, if Foakes (and Greg) are right in believing that Shakespeare wrote only a single stage direction, it is probable that Compositor B would have split it in two to avoid the typographical blemish of a marginal stage direction beginning a column. It would be a lucky hit if Foakes's explanation represented precisely what happened in Jaggard's shop in the early 1620's, but the unusual position occupied by this stage direction forbids an editor from using it to draw inferences about the nature of printer's copy. My only reservation about Foakes's account is the possibility that Shakespeare himself could have written both directions as they now stand. ' Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted ' closely resembles the following stage direction in the First Folio text of The Taming of the Shrew : ' Exit Biondello, Tranio and Pedant as fast as may be ' (TLN 2490). The Shrew , like Errors , has long been thought to have been printed from Shakespeare's "foul papers" as annotated by a book-keeper, but since The Shrew direction is not a duplication, it is regarded as authorial in origin. No other text contains as close a parallel to ' Runne all out ', which no one has doubted is Shakespeare's, although TLN 840 of the fragment of the first printing of 1 Henry IV might be mentioned: '. . . they all runne away . . . .' This fragment is believed to have been printed either from "foul papers" or from a transcript of them. The last erroneous stage direction charged to the book-keeper by Greg is the redundant ' Enter Antipholus, and E. Dromio of Ephesus ' (TLN 1665) already discussed. Since no other evidence in Errors suggests a book-keeper's annotation of printer's copy, this error, too, might better be charged to Compositor B, especially since the same compositor apparently had some difficulty with the only other entrance direction that he set for these two characters: ' Enter Antipholus Ephes. Dromio from the Courtizans ' (TLN 995). In my view it is time that editors abandoned Greg's speculations about a book-keeper's annotations in the printer's copy for Errors —for lack of evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V What then is the nature of the manuscript underlying the Folio text of Errors ? This question, it seems to me, must go without an answer. Certainly Greg's attempt to resolve the problem in terms of a "rigid dichotomy" between "foul papers" and a "prompt-book" fails in part because he characterized "prompt-books" as exhibiting a regularity in the identification of characters in stage directions and speech prefixes that was not achieved until the edited texts published in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Once the effects on the Folio Errors of its passage through the printing house have been discounted, comparison of the variety, inconsistency, and ambiguity in the naming of its characters with the standards achieved in playbooks actually used to guide Renaissance performances has indicated that the alleged confusions in Folio Errors do not, in spite of Greg's later belief, eliminate the possibility that Folio Errors could have been set from such a playbook. Yet there is no positive evidence in the printed text of theatrical annotations such as would be found in a playbook. As a consequence, Folio Errors resists secure classification in either of Greg's categories for printer's copy—"foul papers" or "prompt-books." 16 Such is the case, I suspect, for a good many printed plays of the English Renaissance. Textual theory and editorial practice that rest on putative identification of printer's copy in Greg's terms are probably then grounded only in sand.</field>

Stanley Wells (1972), p. 183; and Evans in The Riverside Shakespeare , quoted at the beginning of this paper. In The Complete Works, Original Spelling Edition (1986), editors Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor appear to follow this tradition in asserting that the First Folio text "is probably based on Shakespeare's own papers" (p. 291). In their General Introduction, they list the following as indications that these papers "in a rough state" served as copy for some printed plays: "loose ends, duplications, inconsistencies, and vaguenesses" (p. xxxiii). The version of this paper cited in the forthcoming Textual Companion to the Oxford Shakespeare is an earlier one presented at the Shakespeare Association of America meeting of 1985. 10 Chambers suggested that Errotis and Erotes were misreadings of Erraticus or Errans , and Sereptus a misreading of Surreptus (p. 312). 11 E. Ant. ( Anti. , An. ) stands for Antipholus of Ephesus in speech prefixes in TLN 619, 633, 638, 641, 662, 1666, 1673, 1680, 1691, 1742, 1755, 1777, 1851-1901, as does Eph. Ant. (TLN 1005). S. Ant. ( Anti. ) is the speech prefix for Antipholus of Siracusa in TLN 815, 1448, 1822-1903. 12 Perhaps the word Errotis represents C's misreading of copy—hence I write "that he had seen." 13 The following facts may provide a larger context for this conclusion: the entrance of ' Antipholis Errotis ' at TLN 394 was the first entrance for one of the Antipholi that Compositor C set into type. For the character's first speech, Compositor C used the prefix ' Ant. ' (TLN 395). (Whether he took over this form from copy or supplied it himself we cannot know; although, as I shall later discuss, printer's copy may have sometimes omitted prefixes before the speeches of characters whose entrances immediately precede their speeches, we can scarcely assume that copy always omitted prefixes in such cases.) In the middle of Antipholus' speech, Compositor C set the entrance of ' Dromio Siracusia ' (TLN 401). Then on TLN 408 he set the speech prefix ' S. Dro. ' and only then, on TLN 409, E. Ant. Perhaps then Compositor C was influenced to set E. Ant. for Antipholis Errotis by his copy's use of S. Dro. for Dromio Siracusia . There is independent evidence to be presented shortly that copy did ordinarily distinguish between the Dromios in speech prefixes. 14 Nell is used for a pun on 'an Ell' and Dowsabell is not even used as a proper name by Dromio in the only speech in which it appears. 15 The view challenged in this paragraph is reported by Chambers as originally Greg's. It would be wrong to suppose that the omission of speech prefixes for speeches delivered by characters entering alone immediately upon their entrances is a definitive characteristic of "foul papers." In the manuscript "prompt-book" of Charlemagne there is an exactly contrary example: Ric . I'm easlye chydd from tumulde; but deare Sr Ent alofte tell me in pryuatt howe yow darre mayntayne it | Whisper, Enter Ganelon yonder a stand es , consultinge wth my foes | Ganelon alofte (Malone Society Reprint [1938], ll. 2131-33) The theatrical annotator has recopied from the right margin to the left the direction for Ganelon's entrance, but in the course of doing so he has incorporated the speech prefix 'Ga' that originally stood in his manuscript into his duplicate of the entrance direction as the first two letters of 'Ganelon'. Here then a speech prefix is omitted as part of the process of theatrical annotation, not as a consequence of an author writing "foul papers" currente calamo . 16 There are, of course, still other categories of printer's copy for English Renaissance plays, most notably intermediate scribal transcripts of "foul papers" that may preserve many features of the original papers. Yet so many of the same features survive in contemporary playbooks that I find it impossible to distinguish, in the case of printer's copy for Errors , among "foul papers," an intermediate transcript of "foul papers," and a playbook.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Evidence for Dr. Arbuthnot's Authorship of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" by Dennis Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In September 1726, Mary Toft, a young, illiterate woman from Godalming, Surrey, announced that she was giving birth to rabbits. Her claim was taken seriously by a large number of people, including members of the medical profession, and for two months the affair was the subject of intense interest and speculation in London. In December, Toft confessed that her story was a lie, and London suddenly was innundated with satires ridiculing those gullible enough to have been taken in by the woman: sarcastic factual accounts, facetious accounts that claimed to be factual, mock suicide notes, false confessions, poems, ballads, engravings, pamphlets, and squibs. Among this flood was "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," a short poem poking fun at some of the men involved in the Mary Toft affair. The poem circulated in manuscript and was not published until 1730, anonymously, in A New Miscellany . Marjorie Hope Nicolson and G. S. Rousseau have called attention to what they took to be an eighteenth-century attribution of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" to Dr. John Arbuthnot. 1 However, they did not press for Dr. Arbuthnot's authorship of the poem. Since Nicolson and Rousseau have written, a new, very early attribution has come to light, and this, together with internal evidence from the poem, allows us to argue that Dr. Arbuthnot very probably wrote "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i The attribution cited by Nicolson and Rousseau is to be found in a scrapbook held by the Royal Society of Medicine, "Toft (Mary), the celebrated pretended Breeder of Rabbits. A Collection of 10 Tracts relative to this most extraordinary Imposture, with a few MS. Extracts" (L. 7. C. 24/19582). This scrapbook contains printed pamphlets, handwritten copies of songs and poems, and extracts from newspapers and books, all relating to the Mary Toft affair. Among these is "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," transcribed, according to a note at the foot of the page, from A New Miscellany . In the upper right-hand corner of this copy of the poem, someone has written "by John Arbuthnot." Unfortunately, too little is known about this attribution to use it to establish Arbuthnot's authorship of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," for neither the attributer nor the date of the attribution can be determined with any certainty. The first page of the scrapbook has this statement of provenance: "Sam. Merriman M. D. Half Moon Street purchased this volume at the sale of Dr. Combe's Books for £ 3.10.0." Underneath, in a different hand, is written, "I succeeded to it at a cost of £ 2.5.0 S. W m . J. Merriman M. D. Charles Street Westbourne Terrace." Dr. Combe is Charles Combe, M. D. (1743-1817). He received a degree of doctor of medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1783 and the next year was admitted by the College of Physicians a licentiate in midwifery. In 1789, he was elected physician to the British Lying-in Hospital where, in 1810, he was appointed consulting physician. Dr. Combe was a scholar and antiquarian (he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1771 and to the Royal Society in 1776). On his death, much of his valuable materia medica was acquired by the College of Physicians. 2 Sam. Merriman, who purchased the Toft scrapbook on Combe's death, is Samuel Merriman, M. D. (1771-1852). Like Combe, he specialized in midwifery. In 1808, he was appointed physician-accoucheur and, in 1815, consulting physician-accoucheur to the Westminster General Dispensary, and he later held a similar position at Middlesex Hospital. Like Combe, too, he was a scholar: he wrote about the history of his profession and collected biographical information on medical and scientific men. S. W m . J. Merriman, to whom the Toft collection passed next, is Samuel William John Merriman (1814-1873), the son of Samuel Merriman; in 1847, he was appointed consulting physician to the Westminster General Dispensary and, in 1849, physician to the Royal Infirmary for Children. 3 Shortly after his death, the scrapbook was acquired by the Royal Society of Medicine, where it has continued to be held to this day. 4 It is difficult to know which of these three men made the attribution—or, for that matter, whether any of them did. The transcription of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" was done in a careful hand and obviously was meant to be a permanent item in the scrapbook. The handwriting is nothing like Combe's. It could be Samuel Merriman's, but there are sufficient differences between the careful hand of the transcript and the specimens of the casual hand of Merriman that I have seen that I cannot be certain. The question of the handwriting aside, the elder Samuel Merriman is the most likely of the three men to have trancribed the poem. He took considerable interest in the Mary Toft incident, making extensive notes on the affair and publishing an article in The Gentleman's Magazine in which he identified the medical men involved in the case whom Hogarth satirized in his print Cunicularii . 5 And transcriptions of other Mary Toft material in the scrapbook appear to have been made by him. Still, since the evidence of the handwriting is not conclusive, we cannot be certain that he is the one who copied "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" out of A New Miscellany . And further, the younger Merriman's hand is very much like his father's, so conceivably the transcription could be his. 6 At any rate, whoever transcribed the poem did not necessarily make the attribution. The attribution was made sometime after the poem was copied. It is in pencil, scrawled aslant the page, thus spoiling the neat appearance of the ink transcription. It appears to have been written hurriedly, perhaps with an unsteady hand or on an unsteady surface. As a consequence, it is difficult to determine whether the hand that wrote the attribution was the hand that made the transcription. To my eye, there is nothing in the short, carelessly scrawled phrase "by John Arbuthnot" that allows us definitively to identify it with the hand of any one of the three men or to exclude the possibility that any one of them may have written it. There are other complications to the matter of who made the attribution. First, the attribution could have been added after the scrapbook passed from the hands of the younger Merriman. Secondly, it is possible that the Toft scrapbook was owned by someone other than Combe and the Merrimans. The Mary Toft incident occurred in 1726. Charles Combe was born in 1743, and even if he began collecting the material as a young man, the earliest he would have come into possession of it would have been nearly forty years after the event. The printed tracts in the scrapbook were published between December 1726 and February 1727, and by their nature they were ephemeral. Combe's being able to gather all these fugitive tracts piecemeal so long after their publication is less likely than his obtaining an already existing collection, one made much nearer the events of 1726. 7 If some previous form of the scrapbook did exist, the transcription of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" could have been added as early as 1730 (when the poem was published in A New Miscellany ) and the attribution made any time thereafter by someone who possessed the transcription before Dr. Combe. In short, the attribution found in the Royal Society of Medicine scrapbook is of dubious value. On the basis of the handwriting alone, we must conclude that it was written by an unknown person at an unknown time. Even if we assume that it was made by the elder Samuel Merriman, who of the three men took the most active interest in the Mary Toft affair, he probably did not transcribe the poem until he acquired the scrapbook in 1817, nearly one hundred years after the event. Whatever the case, it is impossible to know on what basis "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" was attributed to Dr. Arbuthnot. There does exist, however, an earlier attribution, one made by a man whose identity we know and made on a date we can be fairly certain of. Among the papers of Dr. James Douglas in the Hunterian Collection at the University of Glasgow is a transcription of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" (Douglas Papers D336). It is written on both sides of a single sheet. One side contains the first stanza of the poem, and beneath it is written "Bunnys Dad by Dr Arbuthnot." On the other side are the remaining four stanzas and, in the upper right-hand corner, "Deb r 16. 1726." With the exception of the title and accidentals, the poem is identical to "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" as published in A New Miscellany . The poem, the attribution, and the date are in Douglas's distinctive hand. Douglas's attribution must be taken seriously, for he was deeply involved in the Mary Toft incident and he was in a position to know if Arbuthnot wrote "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife." When Mary Toft first claimed to be giving birth to rabbits, she duped a local surgeon, John Howard, who moved her near his home in Guildford so he could observe her closely. Soon reports about the monstrous births began to reach London. By November, rumors had grown so numerous and interest so intense that George I sent two representatives to investigate the woman's story, first Nathanael St. André, surgeon and anatomist to the Royal Household, and several days later Cyriacus Ahlers, surgeon to His Majesty's German household. The two came away with opposite opinions, St. André believing that Mary Toft's births were truly monstrous, Ahlers thinking the whole business a fraud. George I sent St. André to Guildford again, this time accompanied by Sir Richard Manningham, a physician then much in vogue, to bring the woman to London. Mary Toft arrived in London on 29 November and was lodged at Mr. Lacy's bagnio. St. André immediately called in Dr. Douglas to examine her. Douglas was one of the most respected anatomists and men-midwives in London. He had already received a handsome gift from the king for his anatomical researches, and within a year he would become Physician Extraordinary to Queen Caroline. Member of the Royal Society, Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, friend of Cheselden, Mead, and Sloane, later teacher of William Hunter, Douglas embodied professional respectability. But if St. André had called Douglas into the case to bolster his own position that Mary Toft was giving birth to rabbits, he was severely disappointed. Douglas disbelieved her claims from the beginning and had said so publicly. Manningham, too, thought that the affair was a cheat, and the two doctors joined to expose the woman. Luckily, on the evening of 3 December, the porter at the bagnio was caught trying to sneak a rabbit to Mary Toft. She had, he admitted, bribed him to do so. Douglas and Manningham used this evidence to press her to confess. At first she resisted, but on the morning of 7 December she gave in, and by the ninth she was in Bridewell. 8 The incident, however, was scarcely over. Trying to disentangle themselves from the affair, the medical men began to bring out explanations, accusations, defenses, and disclaimers. This spectacle of "the Gentlemen of the faculty," as one newspaper put it, "flinging their bitter pills at one another, to convince the world that none of them understand any thing of the matter" 9 was too much for the London public, who began to suspect that the doctors had been taken in by the fraud or, even worse, had had a hand in perpetrating it. Immediately the town was awash in satires, and nearly every-one who had been involved in the affair was attacked. Even Manningham, who was instrumental in bringing Mary Toft to confess, was ridiculed, jumbled together with the likes of the credulous St. André and Howard. "Shake 'em all in a bag," remarked one wit, "and the best will come first." 10 Douglas, however, escaped being satirized. But he became apprehensive when Manningham published on 12 December An Exact Diary of what was observ'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey . 11 Douglas considered himself to be misrepresented in Manningham's pamphlet, and he started writing his own version of events, which he eventually published as An Advertisement Occasion'd by Some Passages in Sir. R. Manningham's Diary Lately Publish'd . In the process of drawing up this self-defense, Douglas began to collect much of the printed Mary Toft material and to copy advertisements, extracts from newspapers and pamphlets, and satirical poems. Among these was "Bunnys Dad by Dr Arbuthnot." Douglas's date of 16 December must refer either to the day he copied the poem or to the date on the manuscript he copied from. 12 Did Douglas know that Arbuthnot wrote the poem? The two men were acquainted, both having left Scotland to become respected members of the small circle of London physicians. And Arbuthnot, like Douglas, took an interest in the happenings in the bagnio. On 3 December, Lord Hervey wrote to Henry Fox that "I was last Night to see [Mary Toft] with Dr. Arbuthnot." 13 Arbuthnot was at the bagnio earlier that same day, too, and we are fortunate enough that in one of his early drafts of An Advertisement Douglas recorded a meeting on that day between himself and Arbuthnot: "Friday nothing remarkable, but that in about noon I was denyd admittance when I wanted to see her, Mr Howard and Mr St Andre being both abroad; Sir Richd Manningham (which I thought lookd very strange) justifyd the maid in refusing to open the Door. This I told Dr Arbuthnot &amp; others who was by that I was affraid something was hatching who were all of my opinion." 14 None of this proves that Dr. Arbuthnot wrote "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," of course. But when Douglas attributed the poem to him, an acquaintance who was privy to the details of the Mary Toft affair, he could have done so on the basis of something more substantial than a blind guess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii For more evidence that Arbuthnot in fact did write "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," we must turn to the poem itself. I print it here in its entirety, I believe for the first time since 1730. 15 THE Doctor search'd both high and low, And found no Rabbit there, But peeping nearer cry'd, Soho , I'm sure I have found a Hare. THEY all affirm'd with one Accord, When they had search'd her thorough, That Bunny's Dad must be a Lord, Whose Name does end in Burrough: FOR Lords, as well as other Men, Can do but what they can, Engend'ring little Monsters when They cannot get a Man. WHIP, said Sir Thomas , whip the Slut, It is a Breach of Peace, That Woman any thing should put But P-----s in that Place. WHISTON, much plainer than his Creed, These Beasts in Scripture saw; But as the Story proves, indeed. It was Apocrypha. The poem, obviously, is highly topical, in some instances so much so as to be obscure. But the four men mentioned in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" and the reasons for their inclusion in the poem suggest something about who may have written it. This internal evidence is not conclusive, but it does confirm that Arbuthnot is a likely candidate for the authorship of the poem. Nicolson and Rousseau have identified two of the men in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife." The lord "Whose Name does end in Burrough," they suggest, is Charles Mordaunt, third Earl of Peterborough. The person referred to and the precise meaning of the joke in these stanzas are the most obscure in the poem, so our conclusions must be extremely tentative. Still, Nicolson and Rousseau are probably correct. No other lord "Whose Name does end in Burrough" fits the description of the lord here, but the references to monstrosity could point to any number of incidents in the life of the eccentric Peterborough. Nicolson and Rousseau suggest that the allusion is to his unconventional liaisons with Anastasia Robinson and Henrietta Howard. Perhaps. But the linking of "Lords" in the third stanza to the suggestion of impotence (monstrosity conventionally being explained as resulting from enervated sexual power) may point to Peterborough's notorious opinion that the House of Lords was almost utterly impotent. 16 Or the "Monsters" simply could be a more general reference to Peterborough's freakish, unpredictable, and often fruitless behavior—behavior that was the subject of affectionate joking among Arbuthnot and his fellow Scriblerians. Swift admitted that even those who knew Peterborough "have not known how well to describe him," and he acknowledged him to be "restless and capricious," "A fine Gentleman I vow to God, but he wants Probity." 17 Pope described him as a man who "will neither live nor die like any other mortal," 18 and Arbuthnot, referring to his perpetual rambling as well as his quixotic personality, called him "a Knight errant." 19 What is particularly odd is the fact that Peterborough should be mentioned in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" at all. He appears to have played no role in the Mary Toft incident, and he is not referred to in any of the other Toft satires. If the lord in these stanzas is indeed Peterborough, his appearance here may suggest either that the author of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" used the occasion of the poem to turn away from the incident itself for more private banter or that he was closely enough acquainted with Peterborough to know of something he did or some statement he made during the incident, perhaps alluded to here, but now lost to history. 20 If either of these is the case, such a gesture would not be inconsistent with Arbuthnot. Since "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" was not published until four years after it was written, the poem probably was meant for limited circulation only, and this, together with the clearly good-humored nature of the portrait of the lord, gives these two stanzas the air of an amiable private jest. Arbuthnot was particularly intimate with Peterborough at this time, and he was not averse to rallying his friends, much more pointedly than this, and in print. 21 The second person Nicolson and Rousseau identify is the Whiston of the last stanza. He is, of course, William Whiston, scientist and religious controversialist. And when the author of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" said that Whiston interpreted Mary Toft's rabbits as "Beasts in Scripture," he was stating a fact. Whiston argued that, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, Mary Toft truly had given birth to rabbits and thus had fulfilled the prophecy of 2 Esdras 5: 8 that "menstrous women shall bring forth monsters." He did not actually publish this opinion for the world at large until 1750, almost twenty-five years after the event, in Part III of his Memoirs , but it is clear that he was sharing his views among his acquaintances during the early weeks of December 1726: in his Memoirs , he reports that he had discussed them at the time with Samuel Molyneux, who had been involved in the Mary Toft incident from the beginning, regularly had visited the bagnio, and in the last week had helped bring about her confession; and Whiston's prophecy (or at least a garbled version of it) was well enough known to be lampooned in one other Toft satire besides "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife." 22 Since Whiston was a highly controversial figure whose religious heterodoxy and intellectual eccentricity had created a large audience eager to criticize him, 23 it is a bit surprising to find his views mocked in only one of the Tolf satires besides "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," and perhaps this implies that his millenarian prophecy was known only to those who frequented the bagnio, to people like Molyneux—or, like Arbuthnot. Whether or not this is the case, the satire on Whiston in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" is typical of the satires on him written by Arbuthnot and the Scriblerians. Indeed, Whiston was one of their favorite targets, and they mocked him at every opportunity. For instance, when Whiston and Humphrey Ditton proposed to help mariners determine the longitude by anchoring ships at each degree of the meridian and firing rockets at noon, the Scriblerians gleefully lashed out at him. The proposal was so patently foolish that Arbuthnot complained that it had spoiled a satire on Whiston he had planned, though in fact several versions of Arbuthnot's attack on Whiston's project ended up in the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus . 24 The Scriblerians mocked the project again in "Ode, for Musick, of the Longitude," and Arbuthnot made fun of it one more time in his Humble Petition of the Colliers . Arbuthnot's jibe at the longitude project in The Humble Petition reveals why he and the Scriblerians distrusted Whiston so much. In The Humble Petition , a group of lower-class artisans, believing that "certain virtuosi disaffected to the government" are "gathering, breaking, folding, and bundling up the sunbeams by the help of certain glasses" in order to create a monopoly and "throw the whole art of cookery into the hands of astronomers and glass-grinders," petition the government to prohibit all "catoptrical cookery." They except from their proposed ban "the commanders and crew of the bomb-vessels, under the direction of Mr. Whiston for finding out the longitude." 25 Arbuthnot is making fun of the project of the longitude here, of course, but by associating Whiston with a lower class which hysterically builds theories of catastrophe on a paucity of facts, he is accusing him of vulgar credulity: this is the charge he and the Scriblerians most frequently made against the man. For the Scriblerians, Whiston's credulity was particularly evident in his two obsessions, scientific system-building and millenarianism. In 1696, in A New Theory of the Earth , Whiston had constructed an elaborate theory of the structure of the earth and claimed that the Flood had been caused by the collision of the earth with a comet, a theory which he augmented in subsequent editions of A New Theory and in other works. By 1714, he was asserting that the comet that had caused the Flood was the same one that had appeared over England in 1680, and he suggested that at its next appearance it would destroy the earth in a conflagration. Whiston had strong millenarian views which he expressed frequently, and he held numerous heterodox religious beliefs, which caused him to be banished from Cambridge and brought to trial for heresy, but it was this theory of the comet that the Scriblerians repeatedly turned to when they satirized him, for it epitomized for them his enthusiasm and credulity in both science and religion. 26 Arbuthnot was suspicious of these tendencies in Whiston quite early. In his 1697 Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge , he referred to him as an "ingenious Writer," but in spite of the politeness of the phrase Arbuthnot here ranked Whiston with Woodward and other system-builders who "exclud[ed] the Philosophy of Second Causes" and explained the phenomena of nature by appealing to the "wonderful" and the "miraculous." 27 Arbuthnot laughed at Whiston's millenarianism and his fascination with the "wonderful" again in a letter to Swift in which he claimed mock-seriously that he could not share Swift's political concerns because he was "convinc'd that a comet will make much more strange revolutions upon the face of our globe, than all the petty changes that can be occasiond by Goverts &amp; Ministrys and yow will allow it to be a matter of importance to think of methods to save ones self &amp; family in such a terrible shock when this whole earth will turn upon new poles &amp; revolve in a new orbite." 28 As Whiston's theories became more notorious, Arbuthnot and the Scriblerians ridiculed him more openly. Swift satirized him in his depiction of the Laputans' fear of comets in Gulliver's Travels . 29 He was attacked in two other Scriblerian works. God's Revenge Against Punning turns his millenarianism back on itself by claiming that recent national disasters, all foretold by eclipses and comets, are "the Chastisement of a Sinful People" for the " Socinianism , Arianism , and Whistonianism " which have "triumph'd in our Streets." 30 And he is mocked one more time in A True and Faithful Narrative when, at the appearance of a comet, he predicts "the Period of all things is at Hand." 31 Here, once again, his millenarianism is associated with the unthinking, enthusiastic gullibility of the lower classes. Finally, in the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, Whiston's theory is glanced at twice, once in Martin's invention of "Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is to approximate toward the Earth," and again in the millenarian prophecy that "some Comet may vitrify this Globe on which we tread." 32 This last prophecy, delivered as part of an encomium to the monstrous Lindamira-Indamora, slyly identifies Whiston's theory with the kind of popular credulity that is attracted to wonders, monsters, and prodigies. Thus, it is similar to the criticism of Whiston's irrationalism in The Humble Petition and, for that matter, to the attack on his fondness for monsters and prodigies in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife." Indeed, the satire on Whiston in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," with its emphasis on his millenarianism and his penchant for rushing to an irrational conclusion on the basis of wonders and portents, is perfectly consonant with the way he was treated satirically by Arbuthnot and the Scriblerians. The other two men in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" can be identified, one with certainty, the other with a high degree of probability. Neither one irrefutably points to Arbuthnot as the author of the poem, but both suggest that whoever wrote it was probably, like Arbuthnot, present at the bagnio. The "Sir Thomas " of the fourth stanza is, without question, Sir Thomas Clarges, Justice of the Peace. When the porter was caught trying to sneak a rabbit to Mary Toft, Clarges was called to the bagnio. He "strictly examined" Mary Toft, but she denied any guilt. Clarges was infuriated and wanted to put the woman in Bridewell immediately. Since both Douglas and Manningham wanted her under continual observation at the bagnio so that they could get irrefutable proof that she was a fraud, they "earnestly press'd Sir Thomas Clarges that she might not be sent to prison." Manningham spent much of the next two days trying to temper Clarges's wrath, and in his Diary he recorded enough of his maneuvering that we can get a good sense of how angry Clarges was and how he treated Mary Toft: On Monday the 5th, I gave my Opinion to Sir Thomas , concerning Mary Toft ; and lest he should commit her to Prison, I spoke to several Persons of Distinction, and the next Day wrote to the Honourable Mr. Molyneux to assist me in that Affair, . . . After some Difficulty, I prevailed with Sir Thomas Clarges to let her remain in the Custody of the High Constable of Westminster , at Mr. Lacy's Bagnio, till the Cheat should be found out, . . . On Tuesday the 6th, Sir Thomas threaten'd her severely, and began to appear the most proper Physician in her Case, and his Remedies took Place, and seem'd to promise a perfect Cure; for we heard no more of her Labourlike Pains. 33 Clarges's behavior could have been known by the public at large after 12 December, the day Manningham's Diary was published, but the pointedness of the satiric portrait in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" and the fact that Clarges is not mentioned in any of the other Toft satires may suggest that the portrait was drawn by someone who had witnessed Clarges's anger rather than by someone who had pieced it together from the scattered remark in Manningham's pamphlet. Finally, the "Doctor" of the first stanza is, I think, Douglas himself. Whoever he is, the "Doctor" appears to be meant for someone who at first either disbelieved Mary Toft or who could find no evidence to support her claims (he "search'd both high and low, / And found no Rabbit there") and then, "peeping nearer," changed his opinion ("I'm sure I have found a Hare"). St. André, Howard, or Ahlers cannot be meant here, for they were all surgeons, not doctors, a distinction of title rigorously adhered to during this period. And, in any case, they did not behave at all like the doctor in the first stanza. St. André and Howard had believed Mary Toft from the outset, and they foolishly stuck to their opinion until she confessed. Ahlers, on the other hand, thought she was a fraud from the beginning, and he published a scathing attack accusing her and Howard of collusion. Ahlers rarely appeared in the Mary Toft satires, and he was never accused of credulity. 34 Manningham's is a special, and rather strange, case, one that disqualifies him from being the "Doctor." When he went with St. André to bring Mary Toft to London, he examined her and found, as he admitted in his Diary , that the uterus seemed "to contain something of Substance in its Cavity." Throughout Mary Toft's pretended labor in the bagnio, he continued to insist that "something would soon issue from the Uterus ." 35 What exactly he meant by "something," Manningham never made clear. He probably thought that she had found some way to convey parts of rabbits into her uterus, but judging from the satiric attacks on him, nearly everyone interpreted him to mean that from first examining her he had thought that her births truly were monstrous. Whatever his true beliefs, Manningham was seen as a man who had given, as one newspaper put it, "too much Credit to the Cheat," 36 and who had done so consistently, from beginning to end. He was satirized in John Byrom's "A Horrid and Barbarous Robbery" and the anonymous "Mr. P--- to Dr. A-------t." In "St. A-d-é's Miscarriage," he was lumped together with the foolish St. André ("St. A-d-é, Sir Richard, who've made such a Pother, / What would you not give these Rabbits to smother"). All of these poems make fun of his credulity, and none suggests that at one time he disbelieved her and then changed his mind. 37 Of all the medical men involved in the Mary Toft affair, Douglas tallies best with the "Doctor" of the first stanza. (The fact that Douglas transcribed "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" and that this copy is found among the materials he had gathered for writing his self-defense suggests that he, also, thought he was the doctor alluded to.) That Douglas was the butt of satire may seem surprising, for he had made known his disbelief before Mary Toft had been brought to London, and the whole time she was in the bagnio he had worked assiduously to expose the fraud and to make her confess. But Douglas's good reputation was stained by events that occurred on 4 December. By then, Mary Toft had been in London for five days. Although she had been in "labor" almost constantly, she had delivered nothing. The porter of the bagnio had been caught the previous evening. The hoax was about to collapse. On the morning of 4 December, however, the case developed in an unexpected direction, the details of which Manningham recorded in his Diary : On Sunday the 4th Instant, about Eleven of the Clock in the Morning, Dr. Douglass and my self did carefully examine her Belly, when we perceived a Swelling a little above the Os Pubis , such as we had never felt there before, it was long, and, as we apprehended in the Cavity of the Uterus , which we observ'd had little or no Motion, this we could not account for; we each of us examined the Vagina , and found it clear as before, the Os Uteri soft and spread, . . . About Three in the Afternoon, the Pains, like Labour Pains, came on again: I touch'd her as before, and Dr. Douglass , Dr. Mowbray , Mr. Limborch the German Surgeon and Man-Midwife, who were then present, did the same; and we agreed, that the Nature of the Pains were such, and so violent, as we apprehended something would soon issue from the Uterus ; and this we declared in the hearing of many Persons of Distinction, who were then present: And I well remember, the Room being very full, I desired if there was any Person present willing to examine her, that they would do it then while her Pains were upon her. Accordingly, several Persons did examine her, and declared to the same Purpose: After having received several Pains, they, together with the other Symptoms of approaching Labour, vanished on the sudden, as formerly. 38 Having seen St. André, Howard, and even Manningham ridiculed because of their real or suspected credulity, Douglas was upset when he read this passage. Douglas thought that Manningham had misrepresented him, making him appear to have changed his mind, abandoning his initial disbelief and accepting the truth of Mary Toft's claims. He set about writing An Advertisement Occasion'd by Some Passages in Sir R. Manningham's Diary as a truculent defense of himself: I am said to have apprehended that the Swelling which I perceiv'd on Sunday Morning, was in the Cavity of the Uterus, by which, if he means that I apprehended it to proceed from any Animal, or Part of an Animal, either formed or lodged in that Cavity, I can very positively assert, that I was fully convinc'd of the contrary, and never express'd any thing like it. . . . I am said to have agreed with the other Physicians, &amp;c. then present, in apprehending that something would soon issue from the Uterus. Whether these Gentlemen either did apprehend, or said they apprehended any such Thing, I leave to them to determine; but that I agreed with them in these Apprehensions, I utterly deny. It may indeed be true, that being then so much us'd to Mr. St. Andrè 's and Mr. Howard 's positive Way of talking about every thing that related to this Woman, I did not immediately express my Dissent to what they said . . . and from thence, . . . I imagine he had concluded that I was of the same Opinion with them. If this be not the Case, his Memory must have fail'd him, or he has mistaken the Voice of some other Person in the Room for mine; . . . 39 Douglas's self-defense had the predictable result. Within days of his publishing An Advertisement , he was made the target of the satiric poem "A Shorter and Truer Advertisement By way of Supplement, To what was published the 7th Instant. Or Dr. D--g--l--s in an Extasy, at Lacey's Bagnio, December 4th, 1726." And this poem portrayed Douglas in precisely the same way as the "Doctor" in the first stanza of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" is portrayed: as the metaphor of religious conversion suggested by the "Extasy" of the title implies, the poem depicts Douglas as one who, seeing the swelling on 4 December, suddenly was converted from a skeptic to a true believer: HAVE I my Fingers? and have I my Eyes? Or are my Senses fled through much Surprise? There's something sure! must quickly come, From out of Mary Toft her Womb . SEE here! just above the Pubes , Either in Womb , or in th' Tube is A Huge Swelling , within her Belly, Which I'm amaz'd at, let me tell ye! . . . A Birth ! a Birth ! is now at hand, Come in without delay; Nay, come good SIRS, this Moment in, Or I will run away . . . . THESE were my very Words, express , Tho' I've indeed deny'd 'em; And much like these, I do confess, I've often said beside them. This attack on Douglas did not appear until after the excitement about the Mary Toft incident had died down and the public had shifted its attention elsewhere. Douglas published An Advertisement in early January 1727, and "A Shorter and Truer Advertisement" did not come out until the middle of the month. 40 The fact of the matter is that, before "A Shorter and Truer Advertisement," Douglas was not even alluded to in any of the Mary Toft satires. He had, after all, let it be known early on that he thought she was a fraud. In the newspaper reports and factual accounts, which tended to concentrate on the early stages of the hoax and not its final days in the bagnio, he was rarely mentioned. The "accusation" in Manningham's Diary is mostly the product of Douglas's over-sensitivity; even had Manningham meant to imply that Douglas changed his opinion on 4 December, the charge was not made directly, and the insinuation (if such, indeed, existed) was lost in the midst of the more spectacular revelations Manningham made in his pamphlet. By not publishing An Advertisement until early January, Douglas had not made himself vulnerable to attacks until after most of the satires had been written and interest in the incident had nearly exhausted itself. For the general public, those who were not intimately acquainted with the details of what happened in the bagnio, Douglas simply never became a person to mention, let alone satirize. But for those who were in the bagnio, Douglas's actions on that day were well-known. There was a nasty altercation. A witness accused Douglas of being a conspirator and swore out a deposition, a version of which Douglas recorded. It is clear that in the eyes of the accuser, and presumably in the eyes of others, on 4 December Douglas had acted like a true believer: That Dr D-----s on Sunday morning ye 4th Instant after Examining Mary Tofts told ye D. of Mont: &amp;c. That he was Astonishd at ye Bulk he felt betwixt ye Umbilicus &amp; Os pubis, that he had circumscribd it wt his hands, That he cd scarce believe his own Senses, that He wisht others of ye profession wd satisfie 'emselves of it &amp;c. That in ye Afternoon at 5 ye same day, He, wt Many others; atccouteurs, after touching &amp; narrowly strickly Examining her, came into ye foreroom &amp; publickly said she had all the Symptoms of an Approaching delivery, and all wou'd be over in half An hour. 41 It is remarkable that these events of 4 December, which caused such a stir in the bagnio and which were so ripe for satire, never became known to the general public until well over a month after they occurred. Perhaps others there were less certain than the unnamed accuser that Douglas had come out in support of Mary Toft; perhaps Douglas was not seen as fair game until he published his self-defense in early January. Whatever the reason, Douglas's supposed "conversion" appears to have been known only within the circle of medical men and those who were present at the bagnio during the first week of December. The fact that the writer of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" was aware of the incident a month before it was revealed to the public in "A Shorter and Truer Advertisement" suggests once again that he was privy to the happenings in the bagnio, either as an eye-witness or as someone who was acquainted with those who were eye-witnesses. This does not point to Arbuthnot conclusively, though it makes him a plausible candidate for the authorship of the poem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iii If the appearances in the poem of Peterborough, Whiston, Clarges, and Douglas indicate that Arbuthnot could be the author of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," other facts about the poem—facts about its publication and about its satiric theme, strategy and style—are all consistent with his habits. "His imagination was almost inexhaustible," remarked Lord Chesterfield, "and whatever subject he treated, or was consulted upon, he immediately overflowed with all it could possibly produce. It was at anybody's service, for as soon as he was exonerated he did not care what became of it; insomuch, that his sons, when young, have frequently made kites of his scattered papers of hints, which would have furnished good matter for folios." 42 The story of his sons and their kites, whatever its literal truth, epitomizes what is known about Arbuthnot's writing and publishing habits. Arbuthnot, Chesterfield went on to say, was not "in the least jealous of his fame as an author." He seems to have been so unconcerned whether or not he was credited with his own works that he let them pass for those of others and even foisted their authorship on friends as a kind of practical joke ("Dr. Arbuthnot is a strange creature," said Pope; "he goes out of town, and leaves his Bastards at other folks doors"). 43 He often allowed his pieces to circulate in manuscript, not pressing them toward publication, and when they did come out in print, they were usually unrevised and published anonymously. 44 "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" shares all these characteristics: passed in manuscript (as evidenced by the Douglas copy), not published until four years after it was written, and then unrevised and anonymously. Stylistically, too, "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" is similar to Arbuthnot's work. Typically, his satires are occasional, and structurally they are shaped by the event itself or by the free play of wit over the particular historical circumstances that have occasioned the satire. Arbuthnot's lack of structural control—or his lack of interest in asserting such control over his material—has been remarked on by almost all of his critics, who characterize the movement of his satires as digressive, desultory, and casual. 45 Even in The History of John Bull , where one would expect a structural coherence and unity because of its historical frame, its narrative line, and its allegorical method, Arbuthnot's idiosyncratic digressiveness has sent some scholars to the looser models of Menippean satire in an attempt to find a source of his style. 46 At his best, Arbuthnot is superficially similar to Swift: both work in a rapid, centrifugal movement, encompassing more and more targets; but, unlike Swift's satire, Arbuthnot's tends not to have that centripetal countermovement which creates a vertiginous sense of dove-tailing, giving the reader the impression that amidst the rapid proliferation of targets, they are all the same target, sharing common psychological aberrations or identical moral failings. Arbuthnot's targets seem just to proliferate. His mind, as one of his critics has observed, was "keenly alive to the next thing, but not to the unity of all things," 47 and typically his satires are structured serially, drifting from satiric butt to satiric butt, one related to the other by little beyond the fact that they all exemplify a highly generalized "foolishness." Such, too, is the movement of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife." As the alternative title to the poem, "Bunny's Dad," shows, there is no center or focus here. The poem is really a series of four discrete satiric portraits, one simply yielding to the next, building to no discernible structure or unity, each developing its own point or joke. Finally, "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" reflects preoccupations that are central to Arbuthnot's works. Arbuthnot's overriding drive in almost all his non-satiric writing was to eschew the eccentric, the idiosyncratic, and the esoteric and search for simple, commonsensical principles of order or explanation. "The Reader must not be surpriz'd to find the most common and ordinary Facts taken notice of," he said, defending his methods; "many important Consequences may be drawn from the Observation of the most common Things." 48 In this pursuit of the quotidian explanation, Arbuthnot's impulse was to regularize the anomalous, to prefer the usual to the extraordinary, or to perceive the orderly in the aberrant, the explicable in the apparently wonderful and miraculous. In his first published work, Of the Laws of Chance , he showed how the seemingly incalculable vagaries of chance could be reduced to mathematical reasoning and subjected to orderly rules; in An Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge , he mocked system-making that relied on the evidence of the wonderful and miraculous, creating explanations "contrary to the Laws of Nature, and . . . the Philosophy of Second Causes" 49 ; in "An Argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the Births of both Sexes," he demonstrated that an apparent statistical anomaly in birth rates was actually proof of an over-arching regularity in nature; in An Essay on the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning , he argued for the importance of mathematics on the grounds that it revealed the "simple and natural" laws that direct all physical phenomena, "applicable even to such things as seem to be governed by no rule." 50 "There are two things common to all Mankind," Arbuthnot observed, "Air and Aliment," 51 and it is utterly characteristic of him that the only two medical works he wrote were An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies and An Essay Concerning the Nature of Aliments . And it is utterly characteristic, too, that in these two works he rejected all esoteric explanations, finding the reasons for health and disease not in "occult or extraordinary" causes, but in the "Common Properties" of things we eat "daily by Pounds" or breathe "inwardly every Moment." 52 One can see gestures of this profound habit of mind even in his last work, Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights and Measures , where he attempted to systematize the chaos of Greek, Roman, Hebrew and other Near Eastern weights and measures by reducing them to an English standard of equivalents. One reason for studying mathematics, Arbuthnot argued, was that it "frees [the mind] from prejudice, credulity, and superstition . . . by giving us a clear and extensive knowledge of the system of the world." 53 Given his commitment to the idea of nature as an orderly process governed by simple laws, it is not surprising that in his satires he repeatedly attacked prejudice, credulity, and superstition and how they turned the mind away from the observation of the regularity of nature to a fascination with its putative miracles and anomalies. Credulity and superstition, according to Arbuthnot, were rooted in the mind's "incapacity to be moved or delighted with anything that is vulgar or common," 54 and thus one of his favorite targets was the witless admiration of wonders, prodigies, and monsters. In works which he wrote with his fellow Scriblerians, those who seek wonders are marked for special ridicule: Whiston, of course, who builds elaborate cosmogonies from the single anomaly of a comet; Fossile, in Three Hours After Marriage , who proves himself a credulous fool in his enthusiasm for curiosities and monsters; Cornelius and Martin Scriblerus, both of whom are "in daily pursuit of the Curiosities of Nature," fascinated with its "grand Phænomena"—that is to say, with its oddities like earthquakes and monstrous births, not with its simple regularity. 55 In satires which Arbuthnot wrote himself, he also ridiculed the love of wonders, which he saw as springing from irrationality and ending in hysteria and social disruption. In The Art of Political Lying , he listed appeals to "the prodigious" as one of the best ways to manipulate a gullible public into heightened passion and political factionalism. 56 In The History of John Bull , he made the same point in the allegorical figure of "Discordia," who retails stories of "Blazing-Stars, Flying Dragons, and abundance of such Stuff," spreading "Tales and Stories from one to another, till she had set the whole Neighbourhood together by the Ears." 57 He consistently portrayed Whiston as beginning in mindless wonder at an oddity of nature and ending in a socially disruptive millenarian frenzy. Arbuthnot satirized the attraction of the prodigious once more, this time by turning to a human monster, Lindamira-Indamora, in the Double Mistress episode of the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus . Arbuthnot had a major, perhaps the principal role in writing this episode; there exists a manuscript fragment in his hand, with corrections of Pope. 58 And certainly the episode plays out the themes that mark Arbuthnot's attitudes toward the prodigious: its appeal to irrationality (here, Martin's confusion of intellectual curiosity and sexual desire) and the resulting over-emotionalism and social discord (the battle among Martin, Mr. Randal, and the Black Prince and the legal, medical, and theological squabbles that follow). Given Arbuthnot's temperament and his habitual sentiments, "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" easily could have come from his pen. The fact that an illiterate country woman had duped so many educated Londoners for so long with her tale of monstrous births obviously would appeal to a man confident of the regularity of nature and so alive to the absurdity of the wonderful and prodigious. Too, the near-hysteria of the reactions of the characters in "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife"—Clarges's anger, Whiston's millenarianism, Douglas's abandonment of his professional skepticism for unthinking enthusiasm—mirrors Arbuthnot's attitudes about the emotional effect of monsters, miracles, and anomalies. And, perhaps most importantly, the author of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" has gravitated to those instances of the greatest social discord in the Mary Toft incident, when people were "set . . . together by the Ears," as Arbuthnot described the result of a credulous belief in prodigies: Whiston's apocalyptic predictions, the struggle between Clarges and Manningham and Douglas over how to proceed with exposing the fraud, and the day of 4 December when Douglas gave the impression that he sanctioned the monstrous births, thus setting off a chaotic and acrimonious debate. Did Arbuthnot, then, write "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife"? The evidence is not conclusive. But Douglas attributed the poem to him, and he was in an excellent position to know if Arbuthnot had written it. The probable reference to Douglas in the first stanza and, to a lesser degree, the references to Clarges and Whiston in the fourth and fifth stanzas, suggest that the writer of the poem knew first-hand what happened in the bagnio or was privy to the stories that were making the rounds among the medical men. Arbuthnot visited the bagnio, and what he did not witness for himself he could have learned from his medical colleagues. The attack on Whiston's millenarianism and what appears to be the good-humored tweaking of Peterborough—both in terms that were common among the Scriblerians—also point to Arbuthnot. The facts about the publication of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife," its loose, serial style, and its satiric themes are all markedly similar to Arbuthnot's works. And the exquisite sense of the ludicrous in the poem is something that could have come from the pen of Arbuthnot—something, in fact, like what had come from his pen in the Double Mistress episode of the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, where, too, a monster provokes learned and professional men into exposing their own foolishness. Until more evidence is brought forward, I think that we must take Douglas's attribution seriously and consider Arbuthnot's authorship of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" a strong possibility.</field>

In an early draft of his reply to Manningham, dated 12 December, Douglas remarked that the Diary was "published this day" (Douglas Papers D330). 12 This allows us to date the composition of "The Rabbit-Man-Midwife" fairly accurately. As I will show below, the first stanza refers to an incident that happened on the afternoon of 4 December and the fourth alludes to the actions of Sir Thomas Clarges, who first entered the case on the evening of the same day. Thus, the poem was written between 4 and 16 December 1726. 13 Hervey to Henry Fox, 3 December 1726, Hervey MSS. 941/47/4, pp. 28-32, Suffolk Record Office, Bury St. Edmunds. 14 The numerous drafts of An Advertisement are gathered together in the Douglas Papers D330. In the manuscript, it is clear that Douglas had in mind Arbuthnot in particular. He originally wrote, "This I told Dr Arbuthnot who was by" and then added "&amp; others" above the line. This passage was considerably altered by the time An Advertisement was published: "But the most remarkable Thing that occurr'd to me that Day, was, that having desired to visit the Woman, I was denied Admittance, Mr. St. Andrè and Mr. Howard being both abroad. I told several Gentlemen, then at the Bagnio, that I was afraid some new Monster was breeding; and went away with a Resolution to return no more" ( An Advertisement Occasion'd by Some Passages in Sir R. Manningham's Diary Lately Publish'd [1727], p. 15). 15 A New Miscellany (1730), p. 33. 16 "What are the Lords? a few in Number, only possess'd (as one Author has it) of an imaginary Dignity ; they represent nothing but themselves, and so can have no addition of Strength but from themselves; they are in no Circumstances which make them popular, but rather remain a Mark for Envy: the greatest part of them are poor, and none of them are possess'd of a dangerous Wealth; they have no Holdings which procure them Dependencies; they are possess'd of no Castles, or strong Places, nor have they any Being as to Action, but at the power of another; that is, when consider'd as a Body, they are dissolvable at pleasure: and can there be a Description of more harmless Creatures?"

An anonymous defender of St. André, "who knew him intimately . . . for the last twenty years of his life," remarked: "Though he was disgraced at Court [because of his role in the Mary Toft incident], he was not abandoned by all his noble friends. The great Lord Peterborough , who was his patron and patient long before he went to Lisbon , entertained a very high opinion of him to the last." (The defense, signed "Impartial," was first published in The Public Advertiser , 1781, reprinted in The Gentleman's Magazine the same year, and reprinted once again in the third edition of John Nichols, Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth , from which I quote, p. 467.) The statement by "Impartial" is certainly correct, though I have not been able to establish how early the two men knew each other. Peterborough was cared for by St. André during the last few years of his life (see Joseph Spence, Observations, Anecdotes, and Characters of Books and Men , ed. James M. Osborn [1966], I, 114-115; and William Stebbing, Peterborough [1890], p. 220). Peterborough was on friendly terms with him in 1735, when he wrote a letter to Pope from St. André's apartment in Bath ( Correspondence of Pope , III, 468), and it is extremely likely that he was acquainted with him much earlier since St. André was known within the Pope circle and had treated Pope for a cut hand he had gotten in a coach accident a few months before the Mary Toft incident ( Correspondence of Pope , II, 399-400 and 402-403; and George Sherburn, "An Accident in 1726," The Harvard Library Bulletin , 2 [1948], 121-123). 21 For Arbuthnot's close friendship with Peterborough, see George A. Aitken, The Life and Works of John Arbuthnot (1892), esp. pp. 120, 147, 150-53, 161, and 166. For Arbuthnot's willingness to tweak his friends, see his muted satire on Garth and his rather more harsh treatment of Harley in The History of John Bull , eds. Alan W. Bower and Robert A. Erickson (1976), pp. 67, 63, and 86. 22 Whiston's prophecy and his account of his discussion with Molyneux are in Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Mr. William Whiston. Part III (1750), pp. 110-122. The lampoon on Whiston is one sentence: "The learned Mr. Wh---on takes her to be the Whore of Babylon , with seven Heads and ten Horns; which the Divines of our Church have always interpreted to be the Church of Rome " ( A Philosophical Enquiry into the wonderful CONEY-WARREN; lately discovered at Godalmin near Guilford in Surrey [1726], p. 2). 23 For a discussion of the contemporary reactions to Whiston, see John Redwood, Reason, Ridicule and Religion: The Age of Enlightenment in England, 1660-1750 (1976), pp. 37, 118-119, 123-124, 130, 165-169, 182, 204-205, and 209-210. 24 "[Whiston] has at, last publish'd his project of the longitude; the most ridiculous thing that ever was thought on, but a pox on him he has spoild one of my papers of Scriblerus', which was a proposal for the longitude not very unlike his to this purpose, that since ther was no pole for East &amp; west that all the princes of Europe should joyn &amp; build two prodigious poles upon high mountains with a vast Light house to serve for a pole Star. I was thinking of a calculation of the time charges &amp; dimensions. Now you must understand his project is by light houses &amp; explosion of bombs, at a certain hour" (Arbuthnot to Swift, 17 July 1714; Correspondence of Swift , II, 70). The two jabs at Whiston in the Memoirs are Martin's "Method of discovering the Longitude by Bomb-Vessels " and his project "to build Two Poles to the Meridian , with immense Light-houses on the top of them; to supply the defect of Nature, and to make the Longitude as easy to be calculated as the Latitude" ( Memoirs of the Extraordinary Life, Works, and Discoveries of Martinus Scriblerus , ed. Charles Kerby-Miller [1950; rpt. 1966], pp. 167-168). 25 The Humble Petition of the Colliers , in Aitken, Life and Works of Arbuthnot , pp. 375-378. 26 There is no complete scholarly study of Whiston. Discussions of his religious and scientific theories can be found in Redwood, Reason, Ridicule and Religion ; Frank E. Manuel, Isaac Newton, Historian (1963); and Katharine Brownell Collier, Cosmogonies of our Fathers (1934), pp. 109-124. Whiston's religious ideas were scored by the Scriblerians in "Ode, for Musick"; Swift attacked him as one who "denies the Divinity of Christ" in Mr. C----ns's Discourse of Free-Thinking ( The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift , ed. Herbert Davis et al. [1939-68], IV, 31, 34, and 36); Pope referred to his "wicked Works" in "An Epistle to Henry Cromwell, Esq;" ( The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope , ed. John Butt et al. [1939-69], VI, 25.) Two works are invaluable for detailing the reactions of the Scriblerians to Whiston: Nicolson and Rousseau, " This Long Disease ," pp. 133-87; and Ernest Tuveson, "Swift and the World-Makers," Journal of the History of Ideas , 11 (1950), 54-74. 27 An Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge (1697), pp. 9, 8, 31, and 13. 28 Arbuthnot to Swift, 6 August 1715; Correspondence of Swift , II, 184-185. 29 Prose Works of Swift , XI, 148-149.

I have been able to find only two mentions of Ahlers in the Mary Toft satires, and neither charges him with believing her. In the anonymous Much Ado about Nothing: Or, a Plain Refutation of All that has been Written or Said Concerning the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming (1727), he was briefly glanced at as "a fumblfisted fellar" who hurt Mary Toft when he examined her (p. 16). He appeared once more in the anonymous "A Song of the Rabbit Breeder" as the man who angered St. André by not believing the story. 35 An Exact Diary , pp. 9 and 24. 36 The London Journal , 17 December 1726. 37 Much Ado about Nothing also attacked Manningham, but it attacked him for his barbarous treatment of Mary Toft (Manningham had threatened her with a painful operation unless she confessed). Finally, Hogarth satirized Manningham in his print Cunicularii , but he appears to be attacking him for his credulity, not for changing his mind about Mary Toft. I have discussed this point in "Three Characters in Hogarth's Cunicularii —and Some Implications," Eighteenth-Century Studies , 16 (1982), 24-46. 38 An Exact Diary , pp. 23-25. 39 An Advertisement , pp. 33-35. 40 The first notice of An Advertisement is in The Daily Post , which announced it as "This Day is published" 11 January 1727, but it probably came out a few days earlier, as is implied by the title of the reply to it, "A Shorter and Truer Advertisement By way of Supplement, To what was published the 7th Instant."

      <field name="heading_text">"Hesiod" Cooke and the Subscription Game by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While in Edinburgh on Sunday 15 August 1773 Samuel Johnson, engaging in what Boswell described as "some animated dialogue," touched, upon other matters, on Thomas Cooke, "who translated Hesiod, and lived twenty years on a translation of Plautus, for which he was always taking subscribers" ( Life , ed., Hill-Powell, V. 37). The Hesiod was published by subscription in 1728; one volume of the Plautus , containing the translation of the Amphitruo , in 1746, an interval of some eighteen years. During this period Cooke, although all his life impecunious, turned out a sizeable body of hackwork so that Johnson's remark need not be taken literally. Cooke incurred Pope's displeasure and so won a very minor place in the Dunciad (B ii 138), but that is another story. The fullest account of Cooke is by Sir Joseph Mawbey in the Gentleman's Magazine , 1 but Sir Joseph evidently was unaware that two of Cooke's letters had been published in the December 1791 European Magazine (pp. 406-407). 2 There they are preceded by a headnote which states, among other things, that "he is said, in the Biographia Dramatica [1782], to have been singularly skilful in the art of procuring subscriptions to his publications, particularly of a translation of Plautus, of which only one volume was printed in 1746. The following letters from him to Mr. Mackercher and Mr. Annesley, are printed from the originals in his own hand writing, now lying before us." Nothing is said in the Biographia Dramatica biographical sketch of Cooke about his skill in getting subscriptions, but in the account of his translation of the Amphitruo the editor, Isaac Reed (almost surely responsible for the letters in the European Magazine of which he was editor in everything but name), repaired that omission: Mr. Cooke is said to have been better versed in the art of collecting money by subscription, than any of his contemporaries. He always procured the earliest intelligence of a young nobleman returned from his travels, an heir lately come of age, or a rich Creole newly landed. On the receipt of such information, he conducted his attack as follows: He first waited on my Lord, Sir John, or the Esquire, and solicited and received the single subscription of perhaps a guinea. Soon after, he paid a second visit to the same person, pretending to have been but recently informed of his uncommon genius and his zeal to promote the interests of learning, and therefore intreated the honour of dedicating his work to him, which was to be done at the expence of five guineas more. Having obtained this permission, and the cash, his dernier resort was to call on his patron a third time, representing the necessity of prefixing a copper-plate with his arms to the intended dedication. For this piece of service his usual tax was ten additional guineas. By such contrivances he was known to have picked up no inconsiderable sums, especially as he practised the same stratagem on many people, without the least design of inscribing a work to any of them, or even publishing the piece advertised in his proposals. (1782. II. 15) With this as background, the letters, dated March 24, 1744, take on added interest and relevance. I quote them in their entirety; the first was to Mr. Mackercher. Sir You have my thanks for your subscription to my Plautus, and particularly for your favour in doing it without any solicitation; and I shall look on myself as the person obliged, if you will be so kind as to accept of my volume of original pieces, and some smaller things of mine, one of which is a play, which was acted this winter at Drury-lane Playhouse * . I will soon do myself the honour to wait on you, to encourage you to visit my small but pleasant habitation. I have sent to Mr. Annesley by the same messenger, making a request to him, the compliance with which. I believe, will not be to his dishonour or disinterest; and my extraordinary regard to his peculiar fate makes me desirous of his compliance with my request. I am Sir, Your obliged, and most obedient Servant, THOMAS COOKE. South Lambeth , March 24, 1744. P.S. I have inclosed in my letter to Mr. Annesley the preface to my Plautus, which I believe will not be disagreeable to you to look over. The second letter was to Mr. Annesley. Sir, After returning you and Mr. Mackercher thanks for the favour of your subscriptions to my Plautus, I beg leave to submit a request to you, which nothing but my very sincere wishes for your future success and felicity should induce me to make. Having prepared the ten volumes of my edition and translation of Plautus's Comedies, I am determined to pay a public mark of respect to ten persons, with very disinterested views; by addressing a volume to each of them, and without the usual aims of addresses of that sort, being resolved to admit of no return, in whatever manner offered. All that I intreat is, that those persons will be so good, as promoters of the work, towards embellishing it, to favour me with their contributions for a set of copper-plates for each respective volume, for which I have agreed with an eminent engraver for five guineas a set. What I propose by this method is, to defray the expences of my copper-plates, and at the same time to indulge the pleasure, which will be a great one to me, of paying a peculiar tribute of regard to ten persons who I think deserve those tributes. Eight persons (among whom are the Earls of Chesterfield and Godolphin, and Admiral Vernon) have been so kind, on the first application, as to favour me with their contributions for a set of copper-plates each; and I assure you, that it will give me a singular pleasure, to raise a monument of my regard to you, before a volume of an edition and translation of one of the finest ancient authors, and for the reasons which I have given in my address to you, which I have enclosed that you may see what I propose to print; and I make this request to you with the less reserve, as I scorn the expectation of any future advantage from it; and I assure you, that I should with great pleasure do any offices of regard to you in my power. I beg your acceptance of a Prologue and Epilogue of mine on Shakespeare and his writings, which were spoke last winter † , and of a Play of mine which was acted last December. I have enclosed my preface to my Plautus, that you may see at what vast expence of time, trouble, and charge I have been in this work; and I beg the return of the preface because it is part of a set on ordinary paper. When business will permit, and the days shall be tempting, I should be proud to see you and Mr. Mackercher here. I have enclosed a receipt to you for a set of copper-plates; and the favour of your contribution by my servant, shall meet with such returns as I believe will not be disagreeable to you, from Sir, Your obliged, and most humble, and most obedient Servant, THOMAS COOKE. South Lambeth , March 24, 1744. P.S. I shall be glad to print the dedication to the Earl of Anglesea, which I should rejoice to have confirmed time enough for my volume. I have little doubt that the two editorial notes are Reed's. It will be noted that the copper-plate ploy appears in both accounts, although the price varies. But what is of greater interest is the fact that Cooke is linking Daniel Mackercher and James Annesley with the Earls of Chesterfield and Godolphin and Admiral Vernon in his quest for subscribers to the copper-plates. Cooke claims to have eight of the ten dignitaries subscribing for the copperplates, one for each of the contemplated ten volumes of the Plautus ; Mackercher and Annesley would round out the number. Daniel Mackercher was involved in the ultimately unsuccessful attempt of James Annesley to establish his legitimacy as son of Lord Altham and hence the inheritor of his father's title and estates. One hundred and seventy persons subscribed to the Hesiod ; seven hundred and eleven, to the Plautus . The subscription list to the latter reads like a list of the peerage and the eccesiastical hierarchy, with a sprinkling of military men, members of the theatrical and musical world, and foreign celebrities. Among the new subscribers were William Beckford, the Reverend Mr. Thomas Birch, Edward Cave, "Colley Cibber, Esq.", Peter Collinson, Dr. Conybeare, Matthew Concannen, "Mr. Dodsley," Henry Fielding, George and James Fox, David Garrick, George Frederic Handel, John James Heidegger, Dr. Benjamin Hoadley and the Reverend Mr. John Hoadley, Daniel Mac-Kercher (of course), Charles Macklin, Dr. Richard Mead, Edward Moore, Richard Nash (2 sets), Ambrose Philips, William Popple, Samuel Richardson, Jacob Tonson, Jonathan Tyers, Vice Admiral Vernon, Paul and William Whitehead, Charles Hanbury Williams, and "Mrs. [Peg] Woffington." Cooke had spread his net far and wide in eighteen years.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">From the Westminster Magazine : Swift, Goldsmith, Garrick, et al. by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over the past few years I have had published a number of articles on or deriving from eighteenth-century periodicals, largely but not exclusively in Studies in Bibliography . 1 As before, I am still on the lookout for that which has gone unnoted or has long been forgotten. The Westminster Magazine, or Pantheon of Taste (hereafter WM ) was first published in January 1773 and ended publication in December 1785, microfilm of the thirteen volumes being made in 1973 by University Microfilms of Ann Arbor, Michigan. While scholars working before 1973 were able to consult some volumes of the periodical in scattered locations, I am not sure that any of these scholars was able to consult all the volumes. Thus, Mary E. Knapp used the first volume of the WM in her Checklist of Verse by David Garrick (1955), but no other, with the result that at least twenty-five more entries might have been included for appearances of verse by Garrick in the WM . 2 In the 1779 WM (pp. 459-461) a memoir of Garrick has an appended footnote which identifies his earliest contributions to the Gentleman's Magazine , poems in the volume for 1740 on pages 460, 461, 462, 464 and eight verses added to a poem by Gilbert Walmesley (p. 567). This last is not in Miss Knapp's Checklist , nor is a poem on p. 462 of the 1740 Gentleman's Magazine , a poem which she lists only in its autograph form in the Folger (#8a), i.e. Garrick's answer to some verses by L. (Mr. Logie) to Chloe. 3 Number 364 in Knapp, Garrick's "Prologue for the Benefit of the Theatrical Fund of the Drury Lane Theatre," appeared in many periodicals, but its appearance in the WM in 1776 (p. 327-328) is overlooked in her Checklist and in an article devoted solely to that poem. 4 Number 199 in the Checklist is Garrick's own epitaph; it appears in the Whitehall Evening-Post for March 2-4, 1779 and can be read in an "extra-illustrated set of [Arthur] Murphy's Life [of Garrick], and [Garrick's] Private Correspondence , X. 170, newspaper clipping, with letter dating verses, August 1777. [Tom] Davies, Life [of Garrick], (1781), II. 400" (p. 32). The epitaph is not included in the two-volume collection of Garrick's poems published by George Kearsley in 1785. Unless the index to the definitive biography of Garrick is incomplete, there is no mention of the epitaph or the circumstances leading up to it. 5 Now, those not fortunate enough to have access to the few places where the text of the poem is available may be grateful for the opportunity afforded by the WM for 1779 (p. 162). I quote both the head-note and the poem. In August, 1777, Mr. Garrick, accompanied by his neighbour and friend, Mr. Hen. Hoare, of the Adelphi, made a visit to Mr. Hoare, of Stourhead, in Wilts. Being particularly charmed with the Grotto, he said he should like it for his burying-place; upon which one of the company wished him to write his own Epitaph; which as soon as he returned to the house, he did. Extempore. Tom Fool, the tenant of this narrow space, (He play'd no foolish part to chuse the place) Hoping for mortal honours e'en in death, Thus spoke his wishes with his latest breath. "That Hal , sweet-blooded Hal , might once a-year, Quit social joys to drop a friendly tear; That Earle , with magic sounds that charm the breast, Should with a requiem teach his soul to rest; Full charg'd with humour, that the sportive Rust Should fire three vollies o'er the dust to dust ; That Honest Benson , ever free and plain, For once shou'd sigh, and wish him back again; That Hoare too might complete his glory's plan, Point to his grave and say—I lik'd the man." Hal is identified in a footnote as "Henry Hoare, jun. Esq. of the Adelphi Buildings;" Earle, as "Benson Earle, Esq. of Salisbury"; Rust, as "John Rust, Esq."; Benson as "John Benson, Esq."; and Hoare, as "Henry Hoare, Esq. of Stourhead." Benson Earle is William Benson Earle who became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 March 1773, and John Rust's connection with Garrick is demonstrable from the fact that there are two extant letters from him to Garrick, written on January 7 and 17, 1777, the same year as the visit to Stourhead. I find no reference to John Benson in the Stone and Kahrl biography nor in Garrick's letters. 6 Incidentally, the index to Miss Knapp's Checklist lists Number 199 as a reference for Henry Hoare, but there is no mention of him there, and the reader who knows nothing of the circumstances of the epitaph is left in ignorance. Henry Hoare is mentioned only once in the Stone and Kahrl biography of Garrick and there simply as neighbor and acquaintance (p. 121). The WM date for the anecdote, August 1777, will serve to correct the conjectural 1776 date of letters 1035 and 1039 in Little and Kahrl. Nor will one find any reference there to the "Verses from Sir Thomas Mills to Mr. Garrick, on receiving his Portrait painted by Mr. Dance" printed in the 1776 WM (p. 271), or to Sir Thomas Mills himself, who died on 28 February 1793 at Mary-le-bone ( European Magazine , 1793.i. 240). Further, the 1779 WM (p. 461), in a bibliography of Garrick's writings, states that he wrote some pieces in the St. James's Chronicle under the name of Oakley. I believe there is no mention of this, nor any attempt to locate the pieces in question, in any of the literature on Garrick. In addition to the reprinting of poems by Garrick, the WM printed an anecdote about him which is absent from Stone and Kahrl. If it is true, it is sufficiently interesting for inclusion in any account of Garrick. The March 1779 WM (p. 120) printed an anecdote of Garrick's "first appearance in the character of Richard III at the Theatre in Goodman's-Fields" which had him so hoarse at the end of the second act that he could not have gone on had not a gentleman present behind the scenes "having luckily a Seville orange in his pocket" gave it to him, with the result that he finished the part to great applause. But, "had it not been owing to this trifling incident, we might have been deprived of the greatest ornament the British, or perhaps any other stage ever acquired." Incidentally, Tom Davies and Arthur Murphy, early biographers of Garrick, evidently did not know the anecdote. The WM would not, of course, be of more than passing interest, if all one could glean from it was the Garrick material. And there is bigger game. Assuredly, one of the pleasures derivable from the turning over of the pages of old periodicals is the discovery of completely forgotten pieces, usually by minor writers, even obscure ones, for the works of major writers have usually surfaced because of the researches of many scholars. And when one comes upon an attribution in one of these periodicals to a major author the chances are excellent that the piece in question is not his. But there is always the off-chance it may be his. So very much has been written about Jonathan Swift that one is understandably chary of attributing a new piece to him, but the WM has not had wide exposure, and the attribution, a tentative one, is by a correspondent to that periodical and not by me. I refer to "A Humourous Description of Mortality, Said to be wrote by the Late JONATHAN SWIFT, D.D. DEAN OF ST. PATRICK's, DUBLIN." I quote the whole, depending upon others more knowledgeable about Swift's prose to render a decision. As you have been pleased very generously to honour me with your friendship, I think myself obliged to throw off all disguise, and discover to you my real circumstances; which I shall with all the openness and freedom imaginable. You'll be surprised at the beginning of my story, and think the whole a banter; but you may depend upon its being actually true; and, if need were, I could bring the Parson of the Parish to testify the same. You must know then, that at this present time I live in a little sorry ( a ) house of clay, that stands upon the waste as other cottages do; and, what is worst of all, am liable to be turned out at a minute's warning. It is a sort of copyhold tenure, and the custom of the manor is this: for the first thirty years I am to pay no rent, but only do suit and service, and attend upon the ( b ) Courts, which are kept once a-week, and sometimes oftener; for twenty years after this, I am to pay ( c ) a Rose every year; and further than this, during the remainder of life, I am to pay a Tooth (which you'll say is a whimsical sort of an acknowledgment) every two or three years, or oftener if it should be demanded; and if I have nothing more to pay, "Out" must be the word, and it will not be long ere my person will be seized.—I might have had my tenement, such as it is, upon much better terms, if it had not been for a fault of my great ( d ) grand-father: he and his wife together, with ( e ) the advice of an ill neighbour, were concerned in robbing an ( f ) orchard, belonging to the ( g ) Lord of the Manor, and forfeited this great privilege, to my sorrow I am sure; but, however, I must do as well as I can, and shall endeavour to keep my house in tolerable repair. My ( h ) kitchen, where I dress my victuals, is a comical little roundish sort of a room, somewhat like an oven; it answers much to the purpose it was designed, and that's enough. My ( i ) garrets (or rather cock-lofts) are very indifferently furnished; but they are rooms which few people regard now, unless to lay lumber in. The worst part of the story is, it costs me a great deal every year in ( k ) thatchings; for, as my building stands pretty much exposed to the wind and weather, the covering you know must decay faster than ordinary; however, I make shift to rub on in my little way, and when ( l ) rent-day comes I must see and discharge it as well as I can. Whenever I am turned out, I understand my lodge, or what you please to call it, descends upon a low-spirited creeping ( m ) family, remarkable for nothing but being instrumental in advancing the reputation of a great Man in Abchurch-lane*; but be this as it will, I have one snug ( n ) apartment that lies on the left side of my house, which I reserve for my chiefest friends: it is very warm, where you'll always be a welcome guest; and you may depend upon a lodging as long as the edifice shall be in the tenure and occupation of J.S. P.S. This room that I value so much, was set on ( o ) fire once, and my whole building in danger of being demolished, by an unlucky ( p ) boy throwing his lighted torch in at the window, the casement happening to be open.-----I must not forget to tell you. that the ( q ) person who is sent about to gather our quit-rents before-mentioned, is a queer, little, old, round-shouldered fellow, with scarce any hair upon his head; which grotesque figure, together with his invidious employments, makes him generally slighted, and oftentimes much abused. He has a prodigious stomach of his own; whatever he gets, it goes all into his unrighteous maw, which makes a fool of the Ostrich for digestion; he is continually exercising his grinders upon one thing or another, and yet he is as poor as a rake, and by that means goes so light that he is often at a man's heels before he thinks of him; he is very absolute and ready in executing his commission; and has a relation, one ( r ) Tide a Waterman, that is full as saucy and peremptory as himself. If you meet with either of them, and cry out "Stop a little," the devil a moment they'll stay. (1780, pp. 70-71) I append the footnoted explanations of the allegory: a (The body.), b (Divine Service.), c (The colour from his cheek.), d (Adam and Eve.), e (The Devil.), f (Paradise.), g (Jehovah.), h (His Stomach.), i (His Head.), k (Clothes.), l (His death.), m (The worms.), n (The heart.), o (By love.), p (Cupid.), q (Time. This description is elegant, and the slighting and abusing Time, the Teeth of Time, and Man's abuse of the precious jewel, even when he is at his heels, i.e. Death, reminds me of a line I have somewhere seen, "Every moment of Time is a monument to God's Mercy."), r The Author, no doubt, had the old Proverb in his Thought, viz. "Time and Tide will stay for no Man." A "great Man in Abchurch-lane" is explained as "Probably alluding to some Physician or Quack Doctor, resident in that place, who might at that time be famous for curing those vermin in the body." Whoever wrote these notes, and it was not the author, was right. In Swift's The Importance of the Guardian Considered "Mr. John Moor the Apothecary at the Pestle and Mortar" is mentioned (VIII. 9 in The Prose Works , ed. Herbert Davis and Irvin Ehrenpreis), but not otherwise identified. He is, however, the worm-powder man. See Pope's poem, "To Mr. John Moore, Author of the Celebrated Worm-Powder," (Twickenham ed., VI, 161-164) with its reference to " Abchurch-Lane " l. 33, and the note thereupon naming the Pestle and Mortar. George Lyttelton, first Baron Lyttelton, friend of Pope, patron of James Thomson and David Mallet, and to whom Fielding dedicated Tom Jones , has been called "A Minor Augustan" by his modern biographer. 7 His poems were included in that collection of English poets for which Dr. Johnson wrote the Lives , and of those poems Johnson wrote that "they have nothing to be despised and little to be admired. . . . His little performances, whether Songs or Epigrams, are sometimes sprightly and sometimes insipid. His epistolary pieces have a smooth equability, which cannot much tire because they are short, but which seldom elevates or surprizes" ( ad finem ). In any event there is one poem by him in the WM which does not appear in any collection I have seen. It is titled "On Good Humour," with the first line "Tell me ye sons of Phoebus, what is this," and was said to be "[ By the late Lord Lyttelton]" in the April 1774 number (p. 431). Charles James Fox is better known to historians than to students of literature, but he was no exception to the rule that most educated men of the eighteenth century could turn their hand to verse, often of the occasional kind. I wish to call attention to three of his verse efforts that appeared in the WM . The first to appear, in the June 1775 number (p. 325), is titled " Upon Mrs. C--E. By Mr. C. F--X," beginning "Where the loveliest expression to features is join'd" and continuing in similarly complimentary vein. Frances Crewe, daughter of Fulke Greville, married John Crewe in 1766 and soon became a famous Whig hostess and politician. 8 Next chronologically is "An Invocation to Poverty. Said to be written by the Hon. Mr. C. F-x, after the Reflexion on his Penury, thrown out in the House of Commons last Sessions by Mr. Ad--s," in the August 1776 number, "Oh! Poverty! of pale consumptive hue" (p. 440). The poem was also printed in the Sept. 1776 Gentleman's Magazine (p. 428), without "by Mr. Ad--s" and again seven years later in that same periodical (p. 379). The editors of the WM , possibly influenced by the Gentleman's Magazine reprinting, also reprinted the poem in 1783 (p. 585). In the winter of 1773-74 Fox owed some £140,000 in debts, his father finally bailing him out. 9 The only "Mr. Ad--s" in the House of Commons at this time has to be William Adam (no "s") with whom Fox fought a duel on November 29, 1779, in Hyde Park ( DNB ). Fox suffered a slight wound and remarked, "I should infallibly have been killed, if Mr. Adam had not been using government powder." The last of the three poems also has a political atmosphere. It is the "Epistle from the Hon. Charles Fox, partridge-shooting, to the Hon. John Townshend, cruising" in Jan. 1780 (p. 46), a long, three-column affair beginning "While you, dear Townshend, o'er the billows ride" and full of political allusions. The DNB states that Henry Fox's marriage to the daughter of Charles, second Duke of Richmond, was "secretly solemnised at the house of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, the Lady's parents having refused their consent." The March 1773 WM (p. 221) contained the following poem, which I quote in full, since it is not in the three-volume collection of the works of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams. The Review, Written on George II. By Sir Charles H. Williams. Serene the morn, the season fine, Great G--e advances on the plain To view his troops and concubine, The godly blessings of his reign! The trumpets sound, the colours bound, The fields all blaze with arms; Thus Trojan true the Tacticks shew, And Helen all her charms. The God of War and Love by turns Preside upon his phiz; One while you'd think for war he burns, Another while for Miss. You'd think when he surveys his men, He'd waste the world for fame; And that he'd people it again, When he surveys his dame. 'Tis all a farce, and nothing more; This am'rous martial Knight Age won't allow t' enjoy his W--e, Nor courage let him fight. In 1737 George II, on the advice of the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State, sent some one other than Hanbury Williams on a diplomatic mission to Naples, despite Sir Robert Walpole's advocacy of young Williams's claim. 10 Possibly this was the reason for The Review . Another possible reason was the King's displeasure at something for which Hanbury Williams expected praise. 11 When the 1773 Johnson-Steevens Shakespeare was published Philip Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, evidently sent a set to a young lady of his acquaintance, for the November 1773 WM (p. 668) includes a poem titled "Verses sent to a Young Lady, with the New Edition of Shakespeare. By the Right Hon. the Earl of C--.", beginning "Poet of Nature, thou whose boundless art," a thoroughly conventional piece of versification and literary appreciation. Some three years later, May 1776, two poems attributed to him appeared (p. 327), one entitled simply "Verses by the Earl of Chesterfield," beginning "Chlorinda still rejects my hand"; the other, "By the Same," beginning "Let social mirth with gentle manners join." One imagines that the key words in the opening line are "social" and "gentle," the Earl being notoriously hostile to more unseemly mirth. Next to coming upon new pieces, one is almost equally excited by the discovery of textual variants in known pieces. The WM for June 1773 (p. 388) printed a poem, "On the Day of Judgement. By Dr. Swift, and not published among his Works," the text of which differs radically from the accepted text. Sir Harold Williams makes no reference to the WM text, but writes of a version which he has ignored: "The faulty version printed in The Friend , London, 1773, ii. 75-77, is the outcome of imperfect memorizing, and may be ignored." 12 The Friend , a little elementary research reveals, is an error for " The Friends, or original letters of a person deceased . Now first published from the manuscripts in his correspondent's hands [sic], 2 vols. 12 mo. published by Bell," where on page 77 of the second volume the poem appears in Letter LXXX, enclosing a letter from Dublin College, signed F. A. Among other things, F. A. writes "As Swift never gave a Copy of it [the accompanying poem], it has been only preserved in Memory, by a few Friends of his, ever since, to whom he had privately repeated it. From one of whom, Mr. Rochfort , I, this Morning, received the oral Tradition ." Swift numbered members of the Rochfort family resident in Dublin among his friends, it is true, but unluckily I can discover nothing about the author of The Friends . The work attracted very little attention, the reviewer for the Monthly Review remarking "We suppose the letters are what the Editor seems to mean by the term original ; for (though the Writer was not destitute of abilities) we have found nothing very surprizing or interesting in them" (XLVIII, 321). F. A. from Dublin College cannot be Francis Annesley, thrice mentioned in Swift's correspondence and a graduate of Trinity College Dublin in 1682, the year Swift matriculated there, but he might be another Francis Annesley who matriculated in 1719. 13 In any event, the error in the title of the work has been corrected, the possible (even probable) identity of F. A. has been suggested, and I now append the text Sir Harold chose to ignore, as The Friends , from which I print the text, is a rare work, and the WM on film or in the original is not always easy of access. With undigested thoughts opprest, I sunk from Reverie to Rest. An horrid vision seiz'd my head; I saw the graves yawn up their dead; Jove arm'd with terrors ope'd the skies, The thunder roars, and lightning flies; While each pale spectre hangs its head, Jove nodded, burst the clouds, and said,---- "You whom the various Sects have shamm'd, "And come to see each other damn'd, "As Priests have threaten'd (tho' they knew "No more of my decrees than you) "The world's vain business now being o'er, "Such Dogmas may prevail no more; "I 'gainst such Blockheads set my wit: " I damn you all !----Go, go, you're bit." Recourse to Sir Harold's edition reveals that the above text has readings in common with other versions of the poem, i.e. "sunk" in l. 2, "yawn" in l. 4, "The" in l. 6, and "whom" in l. 9. Given the various versions of the poem that exist, that in The Friends should have been included in Sir Harold's collation. From one text to another. The April 1774 WM (pp. 205-207) prints Oliver Goldsmith's poem Retaliation with some textual variations from the received text in Arthur Friedman's edition of Goldsmith's works (1966), IV. 352-359. A headnote to the poem reads, How the following poem by Dr. GOLDSMITH stole into print, we cannot tell, as it was only intended by the Author for the laugh of a convivial party who belonged to a Club at the British Coffee-house , and only three or four copies were given by the Doctor to his most intimate friends. The incorrectness of the versification will shew that the Author never intended it for the public eye in its present form. This jibes with Goldsmith's statement, as reported by William Cooke, that he had given copies to various friends (Friedman, IV. 346). Retaliation , like Swift's Day of Judgement , has had a checkered textual history (Friedman, IV. 346-348), but the WM text has not hitherto played any part in that history. Variants in the WM text in lines 37 (he's fit), 41 (play), 55 (wrangling), and 69 (left) derive from errata , but those in lines 83 (While), 92 (Scotchmen [twice]), 99 (ill judge in), 123 (receiv'd), 128 (one om. ) and 129 (this) are, with one exception, either wrong or of no substantive importance. The possible exception is in the use of "Scotchmen" twice in line 92, since it comes at the end of a series of plurals. "Scotchman" can, of course, be considered a generic plural. There is a nice question, then, about the treatment of texts such as the two discussed, i.e. should they be totally ignored, mentioned only, or collated? I obviously do not believe they should be ignored. I am not sure what, if any, significance to attach to the attention paid to Goldsmith's work in the WM . Arthur Friedman writes, Goldsmith's last four essays appeared in the first and third numbers of the Westminster Magazine , published 1 January and 1 March 1773 . . . all four essays were reprinted in Essays and Criticisms, by Dr. Goldsmith (1798) on the authority of Thomas Wright, who, according to John Nichols, 'printed the "Westminster Magazine" in which he marked the Writer of every article in a copy which probably still exists.' (III. 205) Wright's attributions, while a number of them are incorrect (Friedman, III. 88), are valuable in fixing the canon of Goldsmith's writings, and it was almost surely Wright who influenced the editors of the WM to include so much of Goldsmith's work and material on him. Friedman reprints "The History of a Poet's Garden" from the January 1773 WM ; the "Essay on the Theatre; or, a Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy" (Jan. 1773); "The History of Cyrillo Padovano, The Noted Sleep-Walker" and A Register of Scotch Marriages," both from the March 1773 WM . In addition to these, in order of appearance in 1773: "Humorous Anecdotes of Dr. Goldsmith" (pp. 176-177), partial answer to the "Essay on the Theatre" by K.W. [William Kenrick?] (pp. 193-194), a "Critique" of She Stoops to Conquer (pp. 217-218), and the Prologue and Epilogue to that play (pp. 223-224), all in March 1773. In 1774: "Literary Anecdotes of the Late Dr. Goldsmith" (p. 167), William Woty's "Epitaph" on Goldsmith (p. 207), a four-line laudatory poem on him (p. 263), the poem "Retaliation" with its head-note (pp. 205-207), and Goldsmith's "Epilogue" for Mr. Lewes, in the character of Harlequin (p. 263). In 1775, an extract from the life of Beau Nash (pp. 478-479); in 1776, "Observations on a Simile in Dr. Goldsmith's Deserted Village ," i.e. "So some tall cliff" etc. (p. 432); and in 1777, some more anecdotes (p. 456) and Garrick's poem "Upon Dr. Goldsmith's Characteristical Cookery" (p. 665). None of the above, which would come under the heading of "Writings about Goldsmith," is included in Samuel H. Woods, Jr.'s Oliver Goldsmith, A Reference Guide (1982). 14 And then there are other bits and pieces. Dr. Johnson's Dictionary is such a formidable affair, more than 3000 pages in the two folio volumes of the revised 1773 edition, that few have been hardy (or foolhardy) enough to analyze its contents to any great extent. Any detailed or statistical information about it should, therefore, be very welcome. Helen Louise McGuffie records that in the WM for March 1776 "Leveller" essay number 14 "Includes a brief burlesque of SJ's diction," 15 but unaccountably fails to notice in the same issue (p. 136) another, much more interesting piece on Johnson. A correspondent who signed with four asterisks wrote, While Political Writers are estimating the national debt, or enumerating our forces by land and sea, a friend of mine, a great Philologist *, has employed himself in computing our literary forces; that is, the words which compose the English language, those which are derived from Greek and Latin, and more especially those which are borrowed from the French—with whom we have had a constant literary intercourse for above seven hundred years, ever since the introduction of the Normans under William the Conqueror. The following list exhibits a distinct view of the words derived from the French by Bailey and Johnson, under each respective letter of the alphabet: Johnson [Nathaniel] Bailey Difference. P 692 894 202 C 434 831 397 I 424 675 251 S 387 641 254 R 372 467 95 A 290 495 205 M 287 442 155 T 264 418 154 F 235 351 116 D 216 531 315 U 200 277 77 G 182 249 67 B 169 263 94 E 159 359 200 L 159 191 32 H 106 201 99 O 92 166 74 N 91 122 31 Q 41 51 10 K 7 9 2 W 5 28 23 Y 0 2 2 Z 0 3 3 ---- ---- ---- ---- 4812 7670 2868 The Philologist friend is identified in a footnote as "The Author of a Dictionary of Proverbs lately published for Broke in the Strand," but I can find no record of the bookseller Broke or Brook(e) in the Strand, nor have I discovered a dictionary of proverbs of around this date. The rest of the letter to the WM is a rather spirited albeit facetious defence of the English language against words taken over from the French. Johnson is praised for his omission of many Gallicisms; Bailey is labelled a "laborious Etymologist." Professor McGuffie (p. 201) includes a "'Letter signed C. Risp.' Writer reports on number of borrowed words in the Dictionary " in the WM for January 1777 (p. 25). The nature of her work obviated against any more elaborate digest of the letter, yet the literature on the Dictionary , abundant as it is, contains few pieces as detailed as this letter and that for March 1776. C. Risp writes, Having, in my leisure hours, carefully perused Dr. Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, curiosity prompted me to mark the number of words, which are supposed to be derived from other nations. If you will be so obliging as to give the following List a place in your Magazine, you may probably entertain some of your numerous Readers, and will particularly oblige Your Correspondent, C. RISP.

Risp concludes, "I shall only add, that there is, upon a general computation, about 40,000 words in Johnson's Dictionary, out of which I have only reckoned 15,784 derivatives. The rest are adjectives, adverbs, compounds, or substantives, formed by analogy." Faute de mieux , one may use the statistics in these two letters as a base of departure for further possible study. 16 William Richardson, Professor of Humanities at Glasgow, is principally remembered, when remembered at all, for a series of essays on Shakespeare's characters, with a very few more on other aspects of Shakespeare's plays and on the drama in general. His chief effort in this area was his Essays on Shakespeare's Dramatic Characters of Richard III , King Lear , and Timon of Athens , with an Essay on the Faults of Shakespeare , 1783, 1784, 1785. He had analyzed the character of Hamlet in an earlier volume, published in 1774, and provided additional observations on that character in the 1783 volume. What has gone unnoticed is that parts of the essays on Hamlet, Richard III, King Lear, and on Shakespeare's faults appeared, respectively, in the January, February, March, and August numbers of the 1784 WM . All are signed "W. R." The question arises: Why did Richardson, if indeed it was he, although he was alive and could protest the use of parts of his essays and his initials, submit these pieces to the WM ? And do these parts therefore represent what he thought the essential arguments for the various essays? The essay on Hamlet (pp. 36-39) consists of all but the first and last paragraphs and sections four and five (of five sections) of the additional observations on that character. The critical observations on Richard III (pp. 70-72) consist solely of the first three and last two paragraphs, approximately one third of the original essay. More perplexing is the last sentence of the observations on King Lear (pp. 121-123), the first ten paragraphs (approximately two-thirds) of the original essay, for it reads, "Some further remarks on the distinguished character will conclude these observations in our next number," a promise that was not kept. Finally, and most puzzling, is the essay "On the Imperfections of Shakespeare. In a Letter to the Editor of the Westminister Magazine" (pp. 404-406). First, there is a change in the original title which had "Faults" instead of "Imperfections." Second, the assumption that this was written for the WM , i.e. "In a Letter to the Editor. . . ." Third, the concluding sentence: "Perhaps a future occasion, you will have some further remarks on this subject, from W. R.," another unkept promise. The essay in the WM consists of paragraphs nine through twelve of the original essay. While all this may not be unique in editorial practices in eighteenth-century English periodicals, it is certainly very rare and raises a number of unanswered questions. Who wrote for the WM ? According to two friends of Isaac Reed, both of whom wrote biographical accounts of him, Reed began to contribute biographical articles to the WM about 1773 and continued to do so until about 1780. 17 None of these biographical articles has been identified. Indeed, Nichols's statement, "The biographical articles are from his pen" (p. 80), if taken literally, means that all the biographical articles are Reed's. Reed, according to the same authorities, also wrote biographical articles during this same period for the Gentleman's Magazine and the European Magazine , although the latter did not begin publication until 1782. One of Reed's earliest manuscripts is a collection of "Anecdotes of Sundry Eminent Personages—1765," 18 and he both collected biographical material and published biographical accounts much of his life. Among other biographical compendia are the fourteen Lives he added to a 1790 edition of The Works of the English Poets , the collection for which Dr. Johnson had written the original Lives . And, of course, he was the editor of the 1782 Biographia Dramatica . Both as biographer and inveterate play-goer he was much interested in actors and actresses. As an editor of the works of various literary figures, he was equally interested in men of letters. And hence, while for the most part identification of specific biographical contributions may be impossible, the fact that so very many of these accounts in the years from 1773 to 1780 are of actors, actresses, and writers suggests Reed was, as both Nichols and Bindley noted, contributing rather considerably to the WM in these years. In the years from 1773 through 1779, of eighty-four biographical accounts that were the lead contributions thirty were of actors, actresses, and men of letters, and of that number ten were of actors and actresses. There were no such accounts in 1778 and 1780 and only two in both 1781 and 1782, evidence, I believe, of Reed's declining role in the WM and his prominent part in the establishment of the European Magazine which published its first number in January 1782. For the record, however, in the last three years of the WM there were biographical accounts of two actresses, two actors, and of Samuel Johnson. Of some possible evidential value is the fact that the accounts of Tobias Smollett and Sir John Hill in 1775 (pp. 225-228, 628-630) and of Mrs. Elizabeth Griffiths and Henry Carey (1777, pp. 451-453, 567-568) are repeated in part, and in part verbatim, in the 1782 Biographia Dramatica edited by Reed. Nor is it without significance that one of the biographical accounts in 1775 is of a man, Isaac Madox, of whom Reed had compiled a brief life. 19 However, Reed wrote biographies of Paul Whitehead, Charles Churchill, Robert Lloyd, and Samuel Johnson, among others, for the 1790 seventy-volume edition of Johnson's collection of the English poets and these bear little resemblance to the biographical accounts of those poets in the WM . Indeed, the sketches of Churchill and Lloyd are by a friend and not by Reed. Reed used C. D., i.e. Isaa c Ree d , as a signature for a series of contributions to the European Magazine . 20 The August 1779 WM (p. 413) includes a letter signed C. D. introducing a passage from Johnson's life of Edmund Smith, the same letter with the same signature having appeared on July 31, 1779, in the St. James's Chronicle , the periodical with which George Steevens, Reed's close friend, was intimately associated. 21 Reed's, is then, the only name one can confidently identify as a major contributor to the WM . A few, very few, remaining pieces must come under the heading of miscellaneous information. Thus, a memoir of Bishop Richard Hurd in the May 1781 WM contains a bibliography of his writings (p. 229) which includes "Discord: A Satire, 4to 17----", not elsewhere attributed to him. The British Library catalogue of printed books lists an anonymous 1773 quarto, "Discord. A Satire [In Verse]," which is almost positively the work attributed to Hurd and which must now be included in any discussion of Hurd's career. In November of this same year a contributor pointed out for the first time that Henry Layng, on the evidence of certain lines from one of his poems, quoted in a footnote (p. 633), had helped Pope in his translation of the Odyssey . Austin Warren, in 1932 in an article in the Review of English Studies , brought up the matter of Layng and Pope's translation, quoting a contribution to the May 1793 Gentleman's Magazine (pp. 391-392) by Thomas Park in which the relevant lines from Layng's poem, "The Epistle to Lady Charlotte Fermor," are quoted. 22 But Park had been anticipated by twelve years by the anonymous contributor to the WM . Finally, a five-installment critique of Thomas Otway's Venice Preserved in the 1775 WM , simply signed "W.", should be mentioned, as I did not find it in the literature on Otway. 23 While I do not think it remarkable as criticism, it, like other pieces in the WM that I have discussed, may be grist to somebody else's mill.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Richard Edwards, Publisher of Church-and-King Pamphlets and of William Blake by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richard Edwards was a member of the great book-selling family of Edwards of Halifax whose shops flourished from 1749 to 1826 in both Halifax and London. The founder of the firm, William Edwards (1722-1808), built up a flourishing business in Halifax specializing in second-hand and antiquarian books. He was also a book publisher in a small way, but he was best known as a creator of fine bindings, and the styles of bookbinding he created or perfected are what most connoisseurs associate with the name of Edwards of Halifax. William Edwards had four sons who entered the bookselling business: James Edwards (1756-1816), the best known and most successful member of the family, whose extraordinarily fashionable bookshop in Pall Mall flourished from 1784 to about 1800, when he retired, rich and contented; John Edwards (1758-92), who was in partnership with his brother James in the Pall Mall shop until his death in Paris in 1792 and about whom very little is known; Thomas Edwards (1762-1834), who kept up the Halifax shop very successfully from his father's death until he retired about 1826; and Richard Edwards (1768-1827), who established a second Edwards bookshop in New Bond Street by 1791, published some ephemeral pamphlets and two important illustrated books, and retired from business into obscurity about 1798, just when his most important books were first reaching the public. He is a minor member of an important book-binding, book-selling and publishing family, a man with few claims upon the attention of posterity—except that about 1794 he commissioned William Blake's 547 extra-ordinary folio illustrations to Edward Young's Night Thoughts and published the first part of the text with forty-three engravings by Blake in 1797. This was by far the largest commission Blake ever received, and it had crucial effects upon his life, his art, and his poetry. It offered him a real possibility of fame and fortune, it vitally affected his long manuscript Prophecy called Vala or The Four Zoas (?1796-?1807) written at just this time, and its commercial failure, after Blake had invested in it more time and energy than he could well spare from the work of the world, helped him to determine to leave London and the great world and independence for the seaside village of Felpham and dependence upon one man and obscurity. The man responsible for these effects upon the work and life of the great painter and poet deserves to be better known. Considering the contemporary fame of his father William Edwards and his brothers James and Thomas Edwards and the tardy fame of his extraordinary edition of Young's Night Thoughts (1797) with William Blake's designs, Richard Edwards remains a surprisingly shadowy figure. Except for his distinguished family and for his one act of publishing genius, surpassing that of any other member of his family and probably of any other commercial publisher of his time, Richard Edwards did very little which warrants the attention of posterity. The interest of his career focuses upon his brief and sensational patronage of William Blake—and upon the contrast of this act with the rest of his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bookseller, and Civil Servant Richard Edwards, the last of the eight children of William Edwards, was born in Halifax near four o'clock in the morning of 16 March 1768 and baptised by Mr. Ralph at Northgate End Chapel, like the rest of his siblings, on 17 April. 1 He doubtless grew up near and in his father's bookshop, and by the time the name of the firm was expanded to William Edwards and Sons, Booksellers, early in 1780, when he was eleven, his career in the book trade was probably determined. Presumably he helped out in the shop, wrapping parcels and running errands, and he is likely to have worked in the Edwards of Halifax bindery as well. It may have been about 1789, when he was twenty-one, that Richard Edwards came to London. It seems likely that the young man worked with his brother James at 102 Pall Mall for a time, to learn London ways and to meet London booksellers and bibliophiles. The imprint of Edwards &amp; Sons, Pall Mall or Messrs Edwards, 102 Pall Mall on six publications of 1790-91 2 may imply that the two brothers were acting together as publishers then. It is clear at least that before the end of 1791 Richard "was placed by his father as a Bookseller in [ 142 New ] Bond Street", 3 then as now a very fashionable milieu. His imprint from this address appears on books published from January 1792 through 1798, and he is listed here in Kent's Directory for 1795-97 and in Lowndes's Directory for 1799 but not in that of Kent for 1800. No contemporary reference to the shop by customer or competitor is known. The best, indeed practically the only, indication of the stock which Richard Edwards offered in his shop is contained in the four-page list of "Books [ which ] may be had of R. EDWARDS, Bookseller, No. 142, BOND-STREET ", which was printed integrally with the first edition of De Coetlogon's Human Reason (1792). This also offered in general ☞French Books of Reputation regularly imported.—Foreign Books of Prints, and Antiquities, and Books of History, Science, &amp;c. in all Languages, may be had as above, of the best Editions, and in the most elegant Variety of Bindings. The forty unpriced works included books in French, Italian, Latin, and Greek, and illustrations of ruins, medals, birds, insects, and voyages. Perhaps the most striking feature of Richard Edwards's shop-list is "the most elegant Variety of Bindings" in which the works are offered. Presumably many were bound for Richard Edwards, some of them perhaps in Edwards of Halifax style. Certainly he arranged to have books bound in the Edwards of Halifax style, for a set of the ten-volume Description of England and Wales (1770-75) and Young's Night Thoughts (Rivington, Longman, Dilly, Dodsley, Cadell, Otridge, 1787) were bound in Edwards of Halifax Etruscan calf with orange-grey tickets indicating that they were "Sold by / R. Edwards / —N. 142— / NEW BOND STR. t " 4 This is an ambitious list for a young bookseller in his first year of independent business, but it is not at all in the same class as James Edwards's first Catalogue when he was opening his shop in 1785. And it appears to be the only catalogue of his shop which Richard Edwards ever issued. On 22 January 1793, when he was twenty-four, "Mr. Edwards, of New Bond-street, [ was married ] to Miss Chapman, of Exton, co. Rutland." The fact that the ceremony was recorded in The Gentleman's Magazine (LXIII [Feb 1793], 184) among Marriages of Considerable Persons suggests that Richard Edwards was known then at least to the book world and to John Nichols, the editor of The Gentleman's Magazine , if not to the beau monde. No child from the marriage is known, and it seems likely that his wife died young, perhaps in late 1797 or early 1798. Whatever the cause, Richard Edwards gave up publishing and bookselling some time after June 1798, the latest date in his imprints, when he was thirty. He became instead a civil servant, through the good offices of Earl Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty and perhaps the greatest book-collector of his day. Richard Edwards may well have had book dealings with Earl Spencer at 142 New Bond Street; it would be pleasant to think that his contact with Earl Spencer came when he sold him a splendid coloured copy of Young's Night Thoughts (1797)—and pleasanter yet to believe that James or Richard gave the book to Earl Spencer in gratitude for the appointment. It is more likely, however, that the appointment came through James Edwards, who had been crucially important in the formation of Earl Spencer's collection. 5 Richard Edwards "relinquished business about 1799, on being presented by Earl Spencer to the appointment of Head Registrar of [ the Vice Admiralty Court of ] Minorca". 3 The island had been captured from Spain in November 1798; the order to the Judge of the High Court of Admiralty to prepare the necessary patent for Richard Edwards is dated 1 April 1799; and he sailed for the Mediterranean in June. According to this Patent, he was constituted Registrar and Scribe of the Acts, Causes, and Businesses whatsoever . . . in the Vice Admiralty Court within the Island of Minorca . . . together with all and every the Fees, Salaries, Incomes, Regards, Rights, Profits[,] Commodities, Emoluments, [ and ] appurtenances . . . 6 —probably his income was derived largely or entirely from Fees rather than from Salaries. He may not have stayed very long or profitably in the island, for in a document dated 1 August 1799, presumably at Mahon, Minorca, I Richard Edwards Esq. r do hereby . . . appoint D. Peter Ramis, to be my Deputy as aforesaid, during my pleasure herein only . . . . and to receive all Fees, Emoluments, Salaries, benefits, rights and regards whatsoever unto me belonging, as fully and intirely as if I myself were present . . . for the which Fees, Emoluments, &amp; c the said D. Peter Ramis is and shall be accountable unto me weekly, reserving unto himself . . . one fourth of the whole . . . . 7 Thus the office of Registrar seems to have been farmed to Richard Edwards, who in turn entered into a share-cropping agreement with Don Pedro Ramis. The dates suggest that Edwards entered into the agreement almost as soon as he reached the island, and he may have left the island within weeks of his landing. At any rate, he can have profitted from the avails of his office for scarcely as long as three years, "till the surrender of that Settlement [ on 14 June 1802 under the Peace of Amiens ]. Unfortunately his residence in a tropical country brought on a liver complaint, from the effects of which he never recovered." 3 If, as the document above suggests, he was in Minorca only a few weeks, he must have contracted his tropical liver complaint very quickly indeed. When he returned to England, at least by mid-1802, he may well have been broken in health, though he lived another quarter century. High Elms, from which Richard Edwards was married 8 and in which he lived for several years, was off the St Albans Road, just North of London, at Watford. The house was near St Albans—and it was probably there that his brother James about 1800 "began to enjoy the calm retirement of the country, in the neighbourhood of Old Verulam." 9 It must have been about this time that he inscribed "Richard Edwards High Elms" on the first drawing of each of the great folio volumes of Blake's watercolours to Young's Night Thoughts . Richard Edwards had retired twice by the time he was thirty-five. He may have had a pension when he retired from government service in ill health, but he must have lived chiefly on his considerable personal fortune. He resided for a number of years at High Elms, but in his will of 12 August 1822 he described himself as "Richard Edwards late of High Elms in the county of Hertford but now residing in the City of Bath Esquire." His persistent liver complaint may have induced him to leave cool, damp England for "Saint Omers in ffrance", where he added codicils to his will on 16 July 1822 and 28 March 1825 and where he died 10 October 1827 "of chronic inflammation, in his 59th year. . . . He has left a widow and five sons, to lament the loss of a most affectionate husband and father". 3 In his will he left most of his (unspecified) property to his "dearly beloved wife Mary", including the "furniture pictures . . . vases trinkets Jewels China . . . wines books carriage . . . [ and ] the use of all my Silver plate" plus the use of the house in du Poiroir Street, St. Omer. He directed that £3,000 should go to each of his daughters and his father's gold watch to his eldest son. The rest of the property, evidently controlled by his marriage settlement, was to go to his sons, the interest thereof to "be paid to my said dear wife so long as she shall continue my Widow". 10</field>

For a few of these works, Richard Edwards was merely the co-publisher of a book probably initiated by his prosperous elder brother James (No. 28-29, 34), and in later years he joined a few congeries independent of his brother (No. 24, 36). However, for most of them Richard Edwards acted a remarkably independent rôle: For nine of them he is the only publisher (No. 3-4, 6, 12-13, 22, 25-26), for fourteen more the titlepage says the work was Printed for R. Edwards (No. 2, 5, 7-11, 14, 18, 23, 30-32), and in three more (No. 17, 20, 28), Richard Edwards's name is listed first in a congery, in defiance of the apparent convention that booksellers were named in chronological order of their membership in the City companies. For most of these works, the chief commercial initiative and risk was probably that of Richard Edwards. This is not to say, of course, that most of these works are of independent or significant importance. An unusually high proportion (fifteen of thirty-seven) appeared anonymously. Seven of Richard Edwards's publications (No. 1, 4, 15-17, 19, 27) are so fugitive that no copy appears to have survived in The British Library, Bodley, the hundreds of North American collections covered by The National Union Catalog , The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue, or anywhere else I have looked. At first, 1792-93, the works he initiated were very modest in size (only five are over one hundred pages) and in price (averaging 2 s 3 d ), and the highest price of a work for which Richard Edwards bore the prime responsibility was £1.5.0, or £1.1.0 for the first part (the only part printed) of Young's Night Thoughts (1797), one of the last works he issued. Perhaps his first act in the publishing business was to establish his own journal, the Magazin des Savans: or Literary Miscellany , in part to puff his own publications. A proposal was evidently issued in the late Autumn of 1791, to which a correspondent replied on Christmas day in a letter published in the January 1792 number. This first number was probably accompanied by the engraved titlepage indicating that it was " Printed for R. Edwards N.142 . New Bond Str. t &amp; Halifax Yorksh e &amp; J. Parsons Paternoster-Row ". 12 The editor gave his name as James Merlin, but this may be a pseudonym, perhaps for Richard Edwards. The editor of the Magazin des Savans had a strong biographical bent and sponsored, if he did not write, the accounts of Dr John Brown, the Duchess of York, the Duke of Argyll, the Earl of Bute, and the King of Sweden. The author of biographical anecdotes of the Duke of Argyll was so " violently indisposed " [in April 1792] that he could not continue the biography in the May number, and this indisposition may have given the restive co-publishers an opportunity to reorganize their somewhat infirm journal. In the June issue there was an abrupt change of publisher and, apparently, of editor. A letter to Literary Correspondents in the June issue announced great improvements in the manner of arrangement and variety of matter, several series were abruptly discontinued, the title was altered on the typeset titlepage (probably issued with the June number) to Monthly Register of Literature, or Magazin des Savans , and in Vol. II-III (July 1792-Feb 1793) the Magazin des Savans title was dropped entirely. Coincident with these changes, Richard Edwards, whose name appeared on the engraved titlepage and in the imprint for May 1792, disappeared from the imprint for June 1792 and thereafter, being replaced by J. Owen as publisher in Piccadilly opposite Bond Street. The coincidence of change of style (?and editor) and change of publisher suggests that Richard Edwards was at least closely associated with the editor of the Magazin des Savans , if he was not himself the editor, as well as the publisher, and that the putsch which removed him (or his protégé) as editor drove him from among the publishers as well. The Magazin des Savans was neither very enterprizing nor very interesting as a journal. From the dedication to Her Royal Highness the Princess Frederica-Charlotta-Ulrica-Carolina, Duchess of York and Albany, Princess Royal of Prussia, &amp;c.&amp;c.&amp;c. to its anecdotal biographies of monarchs and noblemen, it had decidedly aristocratic tendencies. It clearly proposed to teach and inform through its monthly moral essays ("on Moral Honesty", "On Gaming", "on Natural and Political Liberty", "on Pride"), its sections on Antiquities and on Arts and Sciences, and in its historical extracts from foreign and domestic publications, and to delight with anecdotes, engravings, and poetry. One of its poetical correspondents was "W. B.", whom one would like to think was William Blake, then working for Richard's brother James on engravings for Stedman's Surinam , though no verse by him was printed in the Magazin des Savans . The journal's sentiments were benevolent rather than political, as in the constitution proposed for the African colony of Bulam, later published in Wadstrom's generous Essay on Colonization , Part II ([?J. Edwards], 1795). The closest approaches to politics in these first four numbers are in the account of the trial of a Gordon rioter (1780) and a speech by Fox (two pages) balanced by Burke's reply (nine pages). The works seem derivative even by the standards of magazines, with sections in the first four numbers copied from Barrett's History of Bristol , Coxe's Travels , Col. Humphry's life of Putnam, speeches of Burke and Fox, the New York Daily Advertiser , The Times , and the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy (to name only those which are identified explicitly). Despite the French title, which might have alarmed anti-Jacobins, the only explicitly Gallic subject is the two-page list of "New Books just Imported" from France which appears in the last number bearing Richard Edwards's imprint. It was probably not a very profitable journal, as its brief life and departing publishers may suggest, and today it is very uncommon, no complete run of it having been located. The first part (24 pp.) of the anonymous History of the Reign of George the Third was published by Richard Edwards and John Parsons with the April number of their Magazin des Savans . Richard Edwards may have been the author of the History , for the publication of the book ceased in April 1792, after 24 pages, when Edwards lost control of its vehicle of publication. Almost all Richard Edwards's publications advertise their Church and King fervour. In his most prolific years, 1792 and 1793, when he published nineteen works, Richard Edwards gave no author on the titlepages of eleven of them, and eight were by the vocal royalist Charles Edward De Coetlogon. It seems at least possible that one or more of the anonymous works is by Richard Edwards. Among the works which he initiated or was a prime mover in, only Merigot's Views and Ruins in Rome (1796-98) and Young's Night Thoughts (1797) are works worthy of much remark. A few details about Richard Edwards may be gleaned from these works. He was probably a private friend of his chief author, Charles Edward De Coetlogon, and he seems to have been one ("R. E.") of the "small circle of [ five ] friends" who signed the dedication to De Coetlogon's Human Reason (1792), along with Charles De Coetlogon himself ("C. D."). He was evidently the editor or author of several of his own publications, such as the Magazin des Savans (Jan-May 1792), History of the Reign of George the Third (1792), Tracts . . . from the Sommers-Collection (1795), Merigot's Rome (1796-98), and Young's Night Thoughts (1797), and he probably entered into his publications in this respect more extensively than any other member of his family. He was evidently on friendly terms with others of his authors besides De Coetlogon, and Vancouver wrote the Advertisement to his Enquiry into . . . Poverty (1796) in his shop. Young E. D. Clarke was in such a hurry to publish his Tour (1793) that he did not read the proofs for it—presumably Richard Edwards did so for him. Richard Edwards doubtless had his share of difficulties with his authors and books. De Coetlogon "hoped the Booksellers will wa[ i ]ve their usual profits" in sales of his Patriot King (1793) for the benefit of the exiled French clergy, and most copies of Clarke's Tour (1793) were "destroyed or lost", evidently at the instigation of their embarrassed author. Most of these works are, of course, remarkably fugitive. Doubtless they were of sufficient interest to contemporaries to return the publisher's investment on most of them but scarcely justifying another edition or the attention of posterity. A few of Richard Edwards's publications were in the public domain, such as Mrs Head, The Pious Mother (1650, 1793), Tracts . . . from the Sommers-Collection (1795), Strutt, Dress . . . of England , I (1796), and Young's Night Thoughts (1742, 1797), but most originated with Richard Edwards. Only three achieved popularity sufficiently rapidly to justify a second edition by Richard Edwards—Alexander, Croup (two editions, 1794), [De Coetlogon] Human Reason (two editions, 1792), and Anon., Address to both Houses of Parliament (2nd Edition, 1796)—but several were later reprinted by other publishers: Anon., Ten Minutes Caution (1792), Bigot de Saint Croix, Histoire de la Conspiration (1793), Cooke, Conversation (1796), Strutt, Dress , Vol. I (1796), [Symmons] Inez (1796), [Merigot] Views and Ruins in Rome (1796-98), Vancouver, Voyage (1798), and Young's Night Thoughts (1797). In the last list, the works of importance are Strutt's Dress , Merigot's Rome , Vancouver's Voyage , and Young's Night Thoughts , and of these Richard played an important rôle only in Merigot and Young. It is a small list, rather narrowly focused on politics, history, and religion, but there are a few publications of a more liberal or practical interest. Richard Edwards's commercial independence as a publisher is noteworthy. He published fifteen works entirely by himself, and he called on the assistance of other publishers for only ten. Further, he never published with the same group twice. In all, Richard Edwards had twenty-three co-publishers for the works he initiated, but with fifteen of these he was associated only once, and six of them (including Edwards of Halifax) were provincial booksellers. He appeared twice or more with only eight of them, but these were the most distinguished in the list, including Debrett (four times), James Edwards (four), Edwards of Halifax (two), Egerton (two), Rivington (four), Robinson (two), and White (three). It is striking that he only cooperated in publishing with his brother James in 1796-98, after he had finished his apprenticeship, as it were, in the second half of his publishing career, and that these are among the more respectable and non-political of his publications. Richard Edwards was not often associated with distinguished publishers, but during the latter part of his career he was in better company. Richard Edwards had comparatively slight interest in the appearance of his volumes during most of his career. In the majority of them the typography and presswork are, at best, indifferent, and in only six of 1793-1797 is the identity of the printer even recorded: No. 13 ([John Lane] At the Minerva Press), No. 20 (J. Brook of Huddersfield), No. 22 (Sampson Low), No. 27 (J. Nichols), No. 29 (At the Philanthropic Reform), and No. 30 (R. Noble). Of these, Richard Edwards probably had little to do with the production of No. 20, 22, 27; Sampson Low is a distinctly humble practitioner of his art and mystery; and the Minerva Press was notorious for the intellectual and typographical slovenliness of its publications. Of the works for which Richard Edwards bore a prime responsibility, only Merigot's Rome (1796-98) and Young's Night Thoughts (1797) are ambitious or distinguished in appearance. Not only were Richard Edwards's publications not elegant in appearance; most of them were not even illustrated. Only six works which he originated had plates, and most of these were negligible: Magazin des Savans , I (1792): 11 plates, mostly technical—portraits and music—rather than beautiful; Wrangham, Reform (1792): 1 plate, a learned joke; De Coetlogon, Reflections . . . on the Murder of Louis the Sixteenth (1793): a sentimental frontispiece; Clarke, Tour (1793): 11 aquatints, mostly unsigned; Merigot, Views and Ruins in Rome (1796-98): 62 handsome and ambitious aquatints; Young, Night Thoughts (1797): 43 plates designed and engraved by William Blake. Only in the last years of his publishing career was Richard Edwards much concerned with the elegance or beauty of his publications, and it is chiefly for these that he should be remembered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Great Illustrated-Book Publisher : Merigot's Rome (1796-98) The first ambitious and illustrated work on which Richard Edwards's name as publisher appeared was A Select Collection of Views and Ruins in Rome and Its Vicinity Executed from Drawings Made Upon the Spot in the Year 1791 . 13 The work was probably issued in fifteen parts each containing four plates and a sheet of letterpress. The drawings appear to be by Vien, but most of the commercial enterprise and labour were J. Merigot's who aquatinted and published the plates. The first twelve engravings, dated 1 March 1796, bear only Merigot's name as publisher, but after this brave start, enough for three numbers, there was a seven-month pause. Probably Merigot, like other ambitious engravers such as William Blake, had discovered that his time, talent, and modest financial resources did not permit him to act effectively as publisher at the same time that he was actively producing his books for sale. To make the work commercially successful, he had to bring in someone with capital and publishing experience, and Richard Edwards, who apparently expected to publish the first part of Young's Night Thoughts in June 1796 (the date on half the plates), may have been eager to participate in such an ambitious undertaking. The risk to himself must have been comparatively slight, since Merigot was providing designs and engravings, the raison d'être of the book, and the chief additional expenses for a single part were for setting a sheet of text and buying paper on which to print plates and text. Probably after the Spring of 1796, Merigot provided the engraved copperplates for his Views and Ruins in Rome and Richard Edwards (and later others) paid for paper, setting the text, printing, paper covers, sewing, labels, warehousing, advertising, and selling the work in parts—a total probably considerably less than Merigot's fair wages as an engraver. Four more numbers, bearing the imprint on the plates of J. Merigot &amp; R. Edwards, were issued in October (No. 4-5), December 1796 (No. 6), and February 1797 (No. 7-9). Perhaps the titlepage to the first Part of the work, dated 1797, appeared with No. 7. 14 There was then a long hiatus of just over a year, during which Edwards must have been busy with the Night Thoughts again. His integral Advertisement to the Night Thoughts is dated 22 December 1796, and the rest of its plates with imprints after June 1796 are dated in January, March, and June 1797. It was only after the first part of the Night Thoughts was published in November 1797 that work seems to have begun again on Merigot's Rome . There was a renewed burst of activity with Merigot's book in the Winter and Spring of 1798; No. 8-10 were published in February, No. 11-13 in March, No. 14 in April, and No. 15, the last for Part I and probably with its half-title, in June 1798. On the completion of Part I of Merigot's Rome , with its sixty-two large, handsome plates, Richard Edwards's connection with the work apparently terminated. Indeed, it may have finished a little before then, for the undated engraved half-title, probably issued with No. 15, bears the imprint only of J. Hearne, who has no other known connection with Part I. By then Robinsons and White, who with Richard and James Edwards had published the Part I title-page dated 1797, were probably in control, perhaps having bought Merigot's share in the work (on condition that Merigot continue to make the aquatints at piece-rates). Richard Edwards may have divided his share with his brother James, who also appears on the 1797 Part I titlepage. When James Edwards went out of business about 1799, his share of Merigot's book went to his successor R. H. Evans of Pall Mall, and that of Richard went to James Edwards's old friend Faulder. The Part II titlepage of [?June] 1799 thus bears the imprint of Robinsons and White (as in the Part I 1797 title-page) and of Faulder and Evans (in place of Richard and James Edwards). The new consortium obviously found the work profitable, for it was repeatedly reprinted on paper watermarked 1806, 1815, 1818, and 1821-24 with various misleading undated titlepages, one of which carried the name of Richard Edwards long after he had gone out of business. Merigot's Rome was regarded as a vendible asset also in the Edwards family, for Thomas Edwards offered three copies in his 1815 catalogue, four in that of 1818, and four (including "the Original Drawings") in that of 1826. Richard Edwards's recorded connection with Merigot's book was entirely creditable, and it is likely to have been profitable as well—at least it must have been profitable to his successors, who reprinted it repeatedly. It seems likely, therefore, that Richard Edwards's termination of his part in the enterprise came about simply because he was leaving business. His motives probably did not include dissatisfaction with his share in Merigot's book. It may have been that Earl Spencer owed James Edwards a favour for his part in the acquisition for Lord Spencer of County Reviezki's library, and Richard Edwards profited from it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Young's Night Thoughts (1797) Richard Edwards was in 1794 a publisher of very modest ambition and accomplishment. He had published only one work costing more than 3 s (Clarke's Tour at 10 s 6 d ) and only two works with more than two plates or 250 pages ( Magazin des Savans and Clarke's Tour , each with eleven plates). Most of his works were conservative political and religious pamphlets of little note except to their authors and publisher. However, great changes were in the air in 1794. The standards of British typography, book design, and binding had made enormous strides in the previous three decades and now rivalled those of France and Holland and Italy. In particular, book illustration had been radically transformed by Alderman Boydell's great Shakespeare Gallery (1786-1805) and by his chief rivals, Macklin's Poets' Gallery (1788 ff) and Bible (1791-1800), and Bowyer's Historic Gallery (1792-1806) of illustrations to Hume's History of England . These great undertakings, costing tens of thousands of pounds apiece, involved most of the great English painters of the day, with commissions of up to £1,000 for a single painting, all the great line engravers in England, who were paid up to £800 for a single folio plate, and the best printers such as Bensley and Bulmer. Type, ink, and printing houses were created for the purpose. Each publisher had a fashionable Gallery to which the public flocked to see the annual exhibitions of specially commissioned huge paintings, and each sustained public interest by issuing their works in parts over more than a decade, at a cost to the subscriber of up to £105 (for Boydell's Shakspeare). There were a number of illustrious illustrated folio publications which grew up in the shadows of these giants, such as Boydell's Milton (3 vols., 1794-97), his edition of Farington's History of the River Thames (1794, 1796), and Thornton's Flora (1797-1807), but they were only seriously rivalled by one other British illustrated literary work, and that was the edition of Young's Night Thoughts undertaken by the twenty-six-year-old publisher of cautious commonplaces, Richard Edwards. There was a striking incongruity both between Richard Edwards's previous publications and his public obscurity as compared to those of the titans whom he was challenging, and between the craftsman of genius whom he commissioned to make all his designs and all his engravings, William Blake, as compared to the scores of famous Royal Academy painters and engravers employed to illustrate Bowyer's Hume, Boydell's Shakspeare, and Macklin's Bible. William Blake was an extraordinary choice for such a Church-and-King publisher as Richard Edwards. For one thing, Blake made his living as an obscure engraver of other men's designs—he was not and could not be a Royal Academician. Before the Night Thoughts was published in 1797, he had signed his name to only twelve designs for four commercially published books, 15 and of the most ambitious and recent of these, a translation of Burger's Leonora (1796) rivalling that published by James Edwards, a caustic reviewer remarked that the figures represented "distorted, absurd, and impossible monsters", exemplifying "the depraved fancy of one man of genius, which substitutes deformity and extravagance for force and expression, and draws . . . imaginary beings, which neither can nor ought to exist." 16 For another thing, Blake was a political and religious radical who wore the white cap of liberty openly in the streets of London, who deplored the unimaginative singularity of "One King, one God, one Law", 17 and who was in fact tried for sedition in 1804. It is difficult to believe that William Blake and Richard Edwards had much in common politically, religiously, morally, or socially. Finally, even as an engraver Blake was not widely admired or even known in 1794, though he was then thirty-seven and near the height of his power as a line-engraver. Before 1794, he had made engravings for about thirty commercial books issued by six different booksellers (eleven of them published by Joseph Johnson), but very few were in folio size, he had received no commission for an engraving, much less for a design, for the great Galleries of Boydell, 18 Macklin, and Bowyer, and he had never been named with honour as an engraver in a review. Indeed, though he had illustrated his own works profusely, he had never made a substantial series of designs for a major literary work. 19 It is, therefore, not easy to see what drew William Blake and Richard Edwards together. They did, however, have a number of interests in common. Both were artists and craftsmen who specialized in copying work by other men to decorate books. Blake's chief commercial patron before 1795 was Joseph Johnson, who was a good friend and commercial colleague of James Edwards, and in 1792 and 1793 Blake was engraving sixteen or more plates for J. G. Stedman's Expedition to Surinam which was published by Joseph Johnson and James Edwards. Further, Blake was particularly intimate during these years with Henry Fuseli, 20 who was a close friend of both Joseph Johnson and James Edwards, and whose ambitious edition of Milton, with plates by (inter alia) William Blake, was announced by Johnson and Edwards in 1791. It would not be at all surprising if Blake were known to Richard Edwards through Henry Fuseli, with whom Richard Edwards must have been acquainted because of his brother, or through Joseph Johnson, with whom he published books in 1794 and later, or through James Edwards—or through all three. Whatever the origin of the connection of the two men, it resulted in the most ambitious commercial work either ever undertook, one which rivalled the very greatest illustrated literary works of that time, or almost any other, in England, those published by Boydell, Macklin, and Bowyer. We may be able to guess a little more confidently at the reasons why Young's Night Thoughts was chosen as the vehicle of their collaboration. Beyond the motives given by Edwards in his integral advertisement, we may remark that Charles Edward De Coetlogon, for whom Edwards had published eight books in 1792-93, had also published an illustrated edition of Young's Night Thoughts (London: Chapman, 1793). It seems extremely likely that Edwards was aware of this edition and was influenced by it and by De Coetlogon to commission illustrations to Young's Night Thoughts himself. Another incentive for the project was probably Richard Edwards's acquisition of a set of first and early editions of the nine parts of Night Thoughts (1742-45), "the Author's own copy" 21 with "The Author's signature" on "the blank leaf". 22 The first intention may have been merely to make an elaborately extra-illustrated copy. 23 If an engraved edition had originally been in contemplation, it is unlikely that they would have used the uniquely valuable author's copy as their text, with all the necessary hazards from an engraver's inky fingers. Further, there would have been little point in making hundreds of extra designs, far more than could ever be published, or in colouring the ink outlines elaborately. But such colouring and such profusion would be perfectly appropriate for an extra-illustrated work. A little later James Edwards's good customer Richard Bull added thousands of extra-illustrations to the Macklin Bible (1791-1800) for his daughter Elizabeth, 24 and John Gray Bell added some ten thousand designs to another set of the same work. 25 Blake himself made a series of 116 watercolours in 1797 in illustration of Gray's Poems (1790) for his good friend John Flaxman—and the method of mounting the text leaves in larger leaves for the designs is just like that used by Edwards for Young's Night Thoughts . It may not have been until the Night Thoughts were well under way that publication of them was thought of. The beginning of the project was probably in 1794. Thomas Edwards, who later offered the watercolours for sale, wrote that Blake "was employed for more than two years" on the drawings, 26 presumably before the book was published in November 1797 and probably before the first plates were dated in June 1796. Each text leaf—over 260 of them—was laid in a window cut into 1794 / J Whatman paper, c. 12” X 16”, for Blake's watercolours, and, probably after the watercolours were completed, these in turn were set into windows of yet larger Imperial folio leaves with an ornamental ruled border round the design-leaf. The pages were consecutively numbered in brown ink, lines to be illustrated were ticked (sometimes two per page) in the margin in pencil by Edwards (or Blake), 27 and Blake set to work with extraordinary energy, making an average of five designs every week for over two years. When Blake had finished the 537 huge watercolours surrounding the text on each side of the leaf, two splendid separate designs were removed from their places in the sequence to form frontispieces (see Pl. 1 here), and the designs were sumptuously bound by Benedict in red morocco "extra", with the leaves gilt. After Richard Edwards had returned from Minorca in 1802, he wrote in each volume "Richard Edwards High Elms", the name of the house he seems to have shared with his brother James. Blake asked £105 but was paid £21 for his work, or about 9 d for each design. This is indeed a "despicably low" price, as J. T. Smith called it 28 —Blake was paid a guinea a design by his faithful patron Thomas Butts in 1799—but it is at least possible that Blake exceeded his commission in the number of drawings he produced. It seems unlikely that Richard Edwards and Blake would have begun on such an heroic scale, and Blake, as the more impetuous of the two, may well have been carried away by his enthusiasm for Young while Richard Edwards stuck to his original bargain for payment. Blake may also have been looking forward to the commission for the engravings. That Blake did not regard himself as ill-used is indicated by the fact that he went on to make engravings for Richard Edwards—and he did not grumble about Edwards in his letters and Notebook as he did about other patrons of the time such as Joseph Johnson, William Hayley, and R. H. Cromek. The drawings themselves are astonishing (see Pl. 1). As Thomas Edwards wrote enthusiastically in 1826: It would be difficult, if not impossible, to convey to those at a distance and who have not seen this magnificent Work, an adequate, or even a faint idea of the singular nature of these most extraordinary and sublime conceptions of our Artist . . . . To embody . . . and give it [ Young's poem ] a visible form and reality, required the skill of a great Artist, and the poetic feeling of the original author combined. . . . It may truly be averred, that a more extraordinary, original, and sublime production of art has seldom, if ever, been witnessed since the days of the celebrated Mich . Agnolo , whose grandeur and elevation of style it greatly resembles, and this alone , if he had left no other work of merit, would be sufficient to immortalise his name, and transmit it to posterity, as that of an Artist of the very highest order. This was the late Mr. Fuseli's opinion. 29 Young's meditative poem was, of course, one of the most popular in an age fascinated by death, but it had not previously been illustrated in an important series of designs. Indeed, before Blake's were published in 1797, the only significant illustrations of it were those by his friend Thomas Stothard, conceived after Blake had begun his series and was well through his engravings, and published in 1798. Blake's series remains not only the greatest suite of designs for Young's poem but the only important one ever undertaken. It is also one of the great series illustrating any author. The watercolours were enormously important for Blake in a number of ways. For one thing, they formed the largest commission in terms of number of drawings he had received—or for that matter was ever to receive. For another, he used in them ideas already mooted in his own works in Illuminated Printing and drew on them in many of his later works. 30 For another, his most ambitious Prophecy, Vala or The Four Zoas , over four thousand lines, was written at just this time (?1794-?1807), and its subtitle, "A Dream of Nine Nights", indicates its structural relation to the nine Nights of Young's poem. (Much of Vala was written on proofs for the Night Thoughts engravings.) For another, the Night Thoughts watercolours must have occupied his time to the exclusion of more profitable labour, and it is notable that his own publications in Illuminated Printing cease in 1795, not to be resumed until 1804 or later. His commissions from other booksellers had resulted in an average of seventeen plates a year for books dated 1790-93, but in 1794-96 they averaged just five. And the watercolours were probably the occasion for one of his most extraordinary experiences: As he told Thomas Phillips, who was painting his portrait in 1807: I was one day reading Young's Night Thoughts, and when I came to that passage which asks "who can paint an angel," I closed the book and cried, "Aye! Who can paint an angel?" A voice in the room answered, "Michael Angelo could." "And how do you know?", I said, looking round me, but I saw nothing save a greater light than usual. "I know ," said the voice, "for I sat to him; I am the arch-angel Gabriel." "Oho!" I answered, "you are, are you: I must have better assurance than that of a wandering voice; you may be an evil spirit—there are such in the land." "You shall have good assurance," said the voice, "can an evil spirit do this?" I looked whence the voice came, and was then aware of a shining shape, with bright wings, who diffused much light. As I looked, the shape dilated more and more: he waved his hands; the roof of my study opened; he ascended into the heaven; he stood in the sun, and beckoning to me, moved the universe. An angel of evil could not have done that —it was the arch-angel Gabriel. 31 We do not know when Edwards commissioned Blake to engrave his designs for the Night Thoughts or what the terms of the agreement were. It seems likely that their agreement was a cooperative one, Blake to provide designs and engraved copperplates, Edwards to pay for setting the text in type, for paper, printing text and then designs (on the same leaves), labels, collation, putting the leaves in wrappers, stitching, warehousing, and advertising—though there was precious little advertising. Such agreements were not uncommon then or later. On 18 October 1795 Alderman Boydell "recommended to Northcote to join with some engraver and share profit &amp; loss [ of Northcote's ten designs of 'The Progress of Virtue and Vice' ] with him as the only way of proceeding now.—Northcote talked of exhibiting them." 32 Joseph Farington, who reports this proposal, had a similar arrangement with Boydell for his History of the River Thames (1794 [i.e., 1796]), paying the mere author of the text (William Combe) on a daily basis—which, as it happens, ate up all the profits. Farington reported on 18 July 1800 that his friend the artist Robert Smirke was going to ask the engraver William Daniell to "execute the Aqua Tinta part of the Plates He proposes to do of subjects from Tom Jones.—I thought it wd. be a good plan &amp; that He might offer William Daniell a fourth of the property for his trouble." 32 James Edwards's collaborators E. &amp; S. Harding were engravers who organized books of views or portraits and then persuaded publishers to share the expenses of publishing with them. William Hodges had such an arrangement for his Select Views in India (1794) and Travels in India (1793) published by James Edwards, which Richard Edwards is very likely to have known about, and Blake's own engravings for Job (1826) and Dante (1824 ff.) were published on a cost-sharing arrangement with John Linnell—though Blake was paid first, and the profits did not materialize until long after his death. Indeed, Richard Edwards's arrangement with the engraver Merigot for his Select Collection of Views and Ruins in Rome and Its Vicinity (1796-98) is very likely to have required Merigot to provide designs and engravings and Richard Edwards to pay the other expenses. Such an arrangement would explain a number of anomalies in the Night Thoughts (1797). For one thing, there is no reference at all on the titlepage to engravings, which to posterity seem the very raison d'être of the edition, and there seem to have been fewer copies of the "Explanation of the Engravings" printed than of the rest of the work—or at any rate some copies lack it. This is what one would expect if the work were to be issued both with and without the engravings—and at least one copy has survived without engravings. 33 Perhaps the arrangement was that Richard Edwards should sell the unillustrated state, for which he had paid all the expenses, and that either the profits or the copies of the illustrated state should be shared with Blake. As a sharer of the risk, Blake would thus have no more cause to repine at the lack of profit than Edwards. Both had, in any case, expected to be rewarded chiefly in fame—and neither lived to see this expectation realized. Yet another indication that responsibility for the text was peculiarly Richard Edwards's may be seen in the fact that one copy was printed on vellum, as in a number of James Edwards's publications, and that it lacks the illustrations (Sotheby, 27-30 June 1906, lot 685). For another thing, Edwards says emphatically in his integral Advertisement that "he has shrunk from no expence in the preparing" of "the present edition". If, as seems likely to me, this statement applies to the printed text but not to the cost of the engravings, it might not be much of an exaggeration—though in excluding the plates it is somewhat disingenuous. Lack of advertising and faulty register and collation aside, this is in most respects a sumptuously and expensively produced publication on the best folio paper, with generous margins, handsomely printed by Noble. If, on the other hand, the statement applies to engravings as well as to text, it leans on the far side of hyperbole to prevarication. Neither the £21 of which we know nor any other plausible payment to Blake is likely to have provided him with fair engraver's wages for his extraordinarily extensive labour. Blake eventually made forty-three engravings (see Pl. 2)—and expected to make about 107 more. At a very modest £5.5.0 each for these outline folio plates, 34 he should have expected £225.15.0 for those he engraved (plus the cost of the copper). It is exceedingly unlikely that Richard Edwards's expenses for the rest of the work came to anything like this total. "All expenses" for seventy-seven and a half sheets of Clarke's Tour (1793) cost Richard Edwards and his co-publisher £140, perhaps excluding the expenses of the eleven aquatints, while there were only twelve and a half sheets of text in Night Thoughts plus one of separate engravings. It is true that thirty-nine pages had to be printed twice, once with text and once with engravings, and that printing from engravings costs a good deal more than printing from type—but printing a short run, say 250 copies, was likely to be one of the smallest expenses of a book, much less than for paper, composing the text—or engravings. The speculator whose investment was heaviest in Young's Night Thoughts (1797) was probably William Blake, and his risk and eventual loss in cash and fame were probably a good deal larger than those of Richard Edwards. When the decision was made to publish some of Blake's Night Thoughts designs, the watercolours in the first four Nights (only) were examined to mark which should be "Engraved". 35 Since the box in which the text appeared in both the watercolour and the 1797 edition was slightly closer to the inner margin than to the outer, Blake had to know, before he began his engravings, whether a design appearing on (say) a recto in the watercolours would be on a recto or a verso in the new printed version; if it were to be on a verso, the design would have to be reversed in the engraving (as happened ten times). The text had to be very carefully estimated (cast off) to determine how many pages there would be and where each page of the text would end, and, probably then, the selected watercolours were inscribed "[ To be ] Engraved" or "[ To be ] Engraved reversed". 36 (This casting off was fallible, for the engraved designs on pp. 25, 40, and 63 illustrate text on the previous pages. It may have been such a defect in casting off which caused the omission in 1797 of the last 58 lines of text for Night II, including the text for the engraving on p. 41.) Many but not all the designs published in 1797 are thus marked, and two (No. 63 and 107) so marked among the watercolours were not engraved. There was similar confusion with the text printed in 1797, for pp. 20 and 61 there have asterisks identifying a line illustrated, but no engraving appeared for that line. There are a number of major differences between the folio engravings for Young's Night Thoughts and those for Boydell's Shakspeare, Macklin's Bible, and Bowyer's Hume. For one thing, all the Night Thoughts plates were designed by the same artist, all were copied (and sometimes altered) by the same engraver, and the artist and engraver were the same man. For another, the designs were integral with the text, printed on the same pages, not scattered penuriously on separate leaves. For another, a far higher proportion of text is illustrated in Young's Night Thoughts (1797) than in any of its rivals. For another, Boydell's, Macklin's, and Bowyer's plates were highly finished engravings—or at least they were advertised as such—whereas Blake's were outline engravings only (though they were not advertised as such). A highly finished folio plate took months or even years to engrave—Blake's for Hogarth was two years in progress—and it would have been quite impossible for Blake to give high finish to the forty-three plates published in 1797, not to mention the 150-200 intended for all nine Nights, within the time that a bookseller could afford to wait. A special advantage of outline rather than highly finished engravings was that they could be more easily and effectively hand-coloured, and such colouring may have been part of the original intention (as E. J. Ellis, The Real Blake [1907], 83, suggests). Certainly Blake did colour a number of copies of the published edition (see below), though he very rarely did so for his other commercial book illustrations 37 —many of which are highly finished engravings. Perhaps the plan was always for Blake to be given copies of the Night Thoughts to colour, as part of his share of the profits of the work. The colouring of these engravings, creating a luminous beauty like that of the watercolours, adds an aesthetic dimension to the Night Thoughts never contemplated by Boydell, Macklin, and Bowyer and makes Blake's coloured Night Thoughts plates rarer, more extraordinary, more valuable, and more beautiful than the works of his more expensive and famous rivals. Boydell and his great competitors had to coordinate the work of painter, engraver, and proof-printer. Blake worked far more efficiently and expeditiously by doing all this work himself; the artist never had to wait for the engraver to take the plate to a proof-printer, for he pulled the proofs himself. Seventy-one proofs for Night Thoughts have survived, including three or four of some plates, revealing extraordinary and important changes in the engravings, and almost certainly there were more proofs. The savings in time and money achieved by having the artist take his own proofs were probably important. And probably most important of all, they mean that the same hand and imagination were responsible for all the preliminary stages of the engravings. Indeed, it is even possible that Blake printed the finished engravings in commercial quantities himself, as he did the quarto plates for Hayley's Life . . . of William Cowper (1803-04). If so, his earnings thus may have been substantial. At the standard rate of 6 s per hundred pulls, the cost of printing two hundred and fifty copies each of forty-three plates would have been £32.5.0, a sum equal to perhaps six months income for the Blakes in some years. The best way to encourage patrons to subscribe to such an edition was to let them see specimens, and Boydell had his Shakspeare Gallery, Macklin his Poets' Gallery, and Bowyer his Historic Gallery 38 to display their designs to be engraved—though they never had so many as 537 unpublished designs to show at once. It was probably for this purpose that a copy was made of one of the Night Thoughts designs on vellum, 39 perhaps to exhibit at the shop of James Edwards in Pall Mall or of Robert Bowyer in Pall Mall, where "Specimens may be seen". Presumably the original watercolours themselves were to be seen in the shop of Richard Edwards in Old Bond Street, and it would not be surprising if some of the watercolours were put on display at the Royal Academy Library, as Blake's designs for Blair's Grave apparently were in 1805. 40 At any rate, they were seen by a surprising number of Royal Academicians. Evidently it was at first expected that the Night Thoughts would be published in June 1796, and 71% of the plates with imprints bear the date of 27 June 1796. The chief known advertisement for the work is a little flyer which probably appeared early in the year: EDWARDS's MAGNIFICENT EDITION OF YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS. EARLY in JUNE will be published, by subscription, part the first of a splendid edition of this favorite work, elegantly printed, and illustrated with forty very spirited engravings from original drawings by blake. These engravings are in a perfectly new style of decoration, surrounding the text which they are designed to elucidate. The work is printed in atlas-sized quarto, and the subscription for the whole, making four parts, with one hundred and fifty engravings, is five guineas;—one to be paid at the time of subscribing, and one on the delivery of each part.—The price will be considerably advanced to non-subscribers. Specimens may be seen at edwards's, No 142, New Bond-Street ; at Mr. edwards's, Pall Mall ; and at the historic gallery, Pall-Mall ; where subscriptions are received. 41 The Prospectus promised four Parts with 150 engravings in all. While at first it may seem surprising that the first Part should have contained four of the nine Nights, the text for these four Nights forms only a little more (28.7%) than 25% of the whole work anticipated in the Prospectus. In the 1797 text, eighty-eight pages of text have thirty-nine engravings (44% of the text-pages have illustrations), plus eight pages of new preliminaries and four frontispieces. These eighty-eight pages represent 61% of the 144 pages of Nights I-IV in the 1740s editions which they were copying. It seems plausible to expect that these proportions would have been maintained in successive Parts of the Edwards edition of Night Thoughts . By extrapolating from these proportions, we may calculate that the four Parts of the Edwards edition of Night Thoughts would probably have been formed as follows: Part Nights Preliminaries Pages of text Percentage of pages Plates Frontispieces One I-IV 8 88 28.7% 39 4 Two V-VI 2 69 19% 30 2 Three VII-VIII 2 85 28.3% 37 2 Four IX 2 73 23.5% 32 1 --- 14 315 99.5% 138 9 (Edwards omitted the two extra pages of Preliminaries in the original Night I and presumably therefore would have omitted the two extra in Night V, the four extra in Night VI, and the six extra in Night VII.) This would have given a total of 332 pages (including one blank page at the end of Parts Two through Four) and 147 plates, totals which are in reasonable conformity to the Prospectus advertisement for "four parts, with one hundred fifty engravings". Notice also that the Prospectus says that the engravings are "to elucidate" Young's poem, not merely to embellish it; this is indeed an ambitious claim. Finally, notice the extraordinarily modest cost of the undertaking: £5.5.0 for 150 large engravings and about thirty sheets of text. Boydell's Shakspeare, Macklin's Bible, and Bowyer's edition of Hume's History of England cost far more than this, up to £105 for Shakspeare, with far fewer plates, though they had much more text (eleven volumes for Shakspeare) and highly finished engravings rather than just outlines. The 1797 Night Thoughts was an extraordinary bargain for those with guineas to spare. However, few book-lovers had guineas to spare just then. Blake's acquaintance the engraver Abraham Raimbach lamented "the abject and almost expiring state to which the fine arts had been reduced" about 1796; "Everything connected with them was, of course, at the lowest ebb". 42 The English war with France had not only cut off the crucial export trade in illustrated books but had caused inflation and a general calling in of credit. The Night Thoughts was advertised and published at a time peculiarly difficult for the arts of luxury. It may have been the flyer for the Night Thoughts which helped to stimulate the first recorded responses among artists. Joseph Farington may have been thinking of Blake's watercolours when he wrote on Friday 19 February 1796: "West, Cosway &amp; Humphry 43 spoke warmly in favour of the designs of Blake the Engraver, as works of extraordinary genius and imagination.—Smirke differed in opinion, from what He had seen, so do I." 32 Blake's good friend Nancy Flaxman, the wife of the distinguished sculptor, certainly was well informed about Blake's project, if not about his poet, for she wrote on 16 March 1796: apropos of Young[,] Edwards has inserted the letter press close cut of Y oungs [Night Th del ] into the large margins making a folio Size[ ; ] this a friend of ours is ornamenting with most beautiful designs in water colours[.] The man who does it, is himself a Native Poet [&amp; an Artist del ] &amp; sings his wood notes [unfettered by any rule del ] whose genius soars above all rule[ ; ] twill be a very lily of the valley [a mountain daisy del ] or the meadow queen, twill be in short the choicest wild flower in Linneas System. Tell in your next the name of it—I never read the Bard in question &amp; have him not in my collection, but [soon I will both read &amp; possess. I have hopes it will be publishd e'er I am much older for del ] from what little I have seen in his writings they seem like orient Pearls at random strung. 44 Her expectation that the Night Thoughts would be "published e'er I am much older" seems to confirm the presumption that it was to be published in June 1796. Another such confirmation comes in the diary of Joseph Farington, who wrote on 24 June 1796: Fuseli called on me last night &amp; sat till 12 oclock. He mentioned Blake, the Engraver, whose genius &amp; invention have been much spoken of. . . . Blake has undertaken to make designs to encircle the letter press of each page of 'Youngs night thoughts.['] Edwards the Bookseller, of Bond S tr employs him, and has had the letter press of each page laid down on a large half sheet of paper. There are ab t 900 pages. 45 —Blake asked 100 Guineas for the whole. Edwards said He could not afford to give more than 20 guineas for which Blake agreed.—Fuseli understands that Edwards proposes to select ab t 200 from the whole and to have that number engraved as decorations for a new edition.— 32 Notice that the £21 seems to be for the drawings only; the proposal to publish the designs is subsequent—and probably separate. It would be pleasant to think that it was Blake's inventions for Night Thoughts which "have been much spoken of". Whatever Edwards's expectations, only twenty-two of Blake's plates were finished by June 1796, and publication could not take place then. Six months later, Edwards believed the first part was ready, he wrote an Advertisement which was published in the book, and he may even have had the text set in type, with the titlepage date 1797. His Advertisement was a curiously muted affair: ADVERTISEMENT In an age like the present of literature and of taste, in which the arts, fostered by the general patronage, have attained to growth beyond the experience of former times, no apology can be necessary for offering to the publick an embellished edition of an english classick; or for giving to the great work of Young some of those advantages of dress and ornament which have lately distinguished the immortal productions of Shakspeare and of Milton. But it was not solely to increase the honours of the british press, or to add a splendid volume to the collections of the wealthy, that the editor was induced to adventure on the present undertaking. Not uninfluenced by professional, he acted also under the impulse of higher motives; and when he selected the Night Thoughts for the subject of his projected decoration, he wished to make the arts, in their most honourable agency, subservient to the purposes of religion; and by their allurements to solicit the attention of the great for an enforcement of religious and moral truth, which can be ineffectual only as it may not be read. From its first appearance in the world, this poem has united the suffrages of the criticks in the acknowledgement of its superior merit. . . . The principal charges which have been urged against this poem, and which in some degree may have affected its popularity, are the dark tints of its painting; and the obscurities which occasionally occur in it to retard the progress of the reader. . . . On the immediate subject of the present edition of this valuable work the editor has only to say that he has shrunk from no expence in the preparing of it; and that to make it as worthy in every respect as possible of the public favour has been the object of his particular and solicitous attention. It has been regarded by him, indeed, not as a speculation of advantage, but as an indulgence of inclination;—as an undertaking in which fondness and partiality would not permit him to be curiously accurate in adjusting the estimate of profit and loss. If this edition, therefore, of the Night Thoughts be found deficient in any essential requisite to its perfection, the circumstance must be imputed to some other cause, than to the oeconomy or negligence of the editor. Of the merit of Mr. Blake in those designs which form not only the ornament of the page, but, in many instances, the illustration of the poem, the editor conceives it to be unnecessary to speak. To the eye of the discerning it need not be pointed out; and while a taste for the arts of design shall continue to exist, the original conception, and the bold and masterly execution of this artist cannot be unnoticed or unadmired. Dec. 22d. 1796. This is an odd piece of puffing, clearly aiming at the lofty judiciousness appropriate to a National Edition. Edwards seems to solicit comparison with the "dress" (?typography) and "ornament" (designs) of the Boydell Shakspeare and Milton, and he appeals, as they did, to national pride, as we might expect from his lex et rex publications. His interest in making the work "subservient to the purposes of religion" is also consonant with his religious pamphlets of 1792-93. He devotes several paragraphs to a discussion of the merits of the poem, oddly stressing its "dark tints" and "obscurities", and he only reaches "the immediate subject of the present edition" in the penultimate paragraph and then chiefly to say that the editor (and publisher) cannot be accused of "oeconomy" or "negligence". 46 Blake's engravings are mentioned only in the last paragraph because "the editor conceives it to be unnecessary to speak" of the designs, whose "original conception, and . . . bold and masterly execution . . . cannot be unnoticed or unadmired." The discrete double negative yet makes a bold challenge to contemporary taste, however. As Blake wrote about 1810, "from all Quarters" he had heard the accusation, "'he can conceive but he cannot Execute'", 47 and it was common to allege that what Lamb called his "wild designs" show "less of art than genius". Edwards's claim that Blake's "execution" was "bold and masterly" echoed Blake's opinion but not the public's. Such an unconventional conclusion by a publisher striving for conventionality suggests that he had been advised in this point by some friend of Blake's, such as Fuseli. But, believing that Blake's designs "cannot be . . . unadmired", Edwards was surely negligent not to give some indication of what is admirable in the most expensive and important feature of this edition. Their spiritual daring, their artistic originality, their brilliant commentary upon Young's poem, man, and God surely deserve at least passing remark. The explanation for such silence may lie in an English reluctance to speak about art—great art should speak for itself—and the greatest illustrated books of the day rarely devoted much space to praising their engravings. The difference was that Boydell, Macklin, Bowyer, and others had previously focused attention exclusively upon the designs of their famous painters through exhibitions and through catalogues and reviews of those exhibitions. The Night Thoughts designs by the obscure William Blake were known to the general public only through two very brief advertisements—and through the engravings themselves. About the time Edwards wrote his account of the Night Thoughts , he placed an advertisement or notice of it in the first volume of the Monthly Epitome and Catalogue of New Publications , I (Jan 1797), 79: Young's Night Thoughts , with Etchings and Engravings, in Four Parts, Atlas sized 4to. to Subscribers 51.5s to Non-subscribers 61.6s. (Part I. in a few days.) Edwards , Bond-street . The reference to "Etchings and Engravings" may mean that Edwards wished to press forward to publication even with plates which had been etched with needle and acid but not yet engraved with the burin (his separate flyer of June speaks only of "engravings"), but if so he was disappointed, for the plates bear dates of January, March, and June 1797, and the work was not published, apparently, until November. The only information in the Monthly Epitome not in the June flyer is that the price to Non-Subscribers was £6.6.0—previously the sum was not specified. Once again a Night Thoughts advertisement seems to have stimulated gossip about it in the artistic world. On 12 January 1797 Farington, Hoppner, Stothard, Rigaud, and Opie met on Royal Academy business at Wright's Coffee House, and Farington recorded in his Diary: "We supped together and had laughable conversation. Blakes eccentric designs were mentioned. Stothard supported his claims to Genius, but allowed He had been misled to extravagance in his art, &amp; He knew by whom [ Fuseli ]. 48 —Hoppner ridiculed the absurdity of his designs, and said nothing could be more easy than to produce such.—They were like the conceits of a drunken fellow or a madman. 'Represent a man sitting on the moon, and pissing the Sun out—that would be a whim of as much merit.'—Stothard was angry mistaking the laughter caused by Hoppners description.—" 32 The work was apparently published in the Autumn of 1797, when James Edwards sold a copy to William Roscoe, as he indicated in his bill of 2 January 1798: "Nov 6 . . . Young's N. Tho t.s N o. 1/1 £ /1 s /. 1 Sub. 1/1. [£]2.2—". Nancy Flaxman may have been referring to the publication of the book when she wrote in early November 1797 to "My Good Friend" "Signora B—" that her previous epistle, which never arrived, probably "contain'd to the best of my Remembrance an Account of Some designs made by a friend of ours for your favorite Bard—Young[.] Blake is the artists name, ' Native Poet he['] &amp;c one who has sung his wood notes wild—of a Strong &amp; Singular Imagination[ ; ]—he has treated his Poet most Poetically—Flaxman has employ'd him to Illuminate the works of Grey for my library—". 49 There was no review of any kind, and the work may scarcely have been published. Perhaps Richard Edwards was distracted in the Winter and Spring of 1798 in publishing the parts of Merigot's Rome , which had been suspended (January 1797-January 1798) while Night Thoughts Part I was published. At any rate, no sale of or immediate reaction to it is known, and thirteen years later Crabb Robinson reported that the Edwards edition of Night Thoughts "is no longer to be bought, so excessively rare has it become". 50 (By this he presumably meant that it was no longer available from the dealers of whom he first enquired.) Within a few months of the publication of the Night Thoughts , Richard Edwards probably knew that he was going out of business. In 1796 he had been involved in the publication of four very ambitious illustrated works—Strutt's Dress Vol. I ([?July] 1796-[?Feb] 1797), Merigot's Rome Vol. I (Oct 1796-Jan 1797), Young's Night Thoughts (announced for June [?1796]), and Vancouver's Voyage (announced May 1797, published August 1798)—but this was apparently too much for him to manage. He suspended publication of Merigot's Rome (January 1797-January 1798) and abandoned Strutt's Dress (by March[?] 1797) while the Night Thoughts was being completed (Jan-Nov 1797), and Night Thoughts may have been suspended in its turn when Merigot's Rome Vol. I was resumed (Feb-June 1798). He evidently withdrew from Vancouver's Voyage in May 1798. By mid-1798 Richard Edwards withdrew from publishing Merigot's Rome and probably from bookselling entirely. When he was going out of business, he needed to dispose of his stock. The obvious buyer was his brother James, but already, by 3 November 1797, James had determined "to reduce my Stock to a very complete private Library". 1 Richard may have chosen to sell his stock of Night Thoughts to R. H. Evans, James Edwards's successor in 1799, who became the publisher with Blake of Hayley's Designs to A Series of Ballads (1802) or to Faulder, to whom he evidently sold his share of Merigot's Rome . Certainly the remainder of the Night Thoughts (1797) did not turn up in the sales of his brothers James and Thomas in 1799, 1804, 1815, 1818, 1826, and 1828. When Richard Edwards was disposing of his stock, he is likely to have given some copies of Night Thoughts to Blake in payment for his engraving work, and Blake in turn coloured and sold several of them. Copies with elaborate and sometimes wonderfully beautiful colouring were sold to Blake's contemporaries Thomas Butts (his chief patron in 1794-1810), Mrs Bliss (sold in 1826 for £4.4.0), Sir John Soane, Thomas Gaisford, Samuel Boddington, George John Spencer (Earl Spencer), "W. E." (?William Ensom), and John S. Harford Jr. 51 Coloured copy Q is inscribed "This Copy was coloured for me by M r Blake / W. E." and Copy R (Harford's): "This copy col rd by W. Blake". The colouring in some examples may have been repeated from Blake's master copy by Mrs. Blake or others, for Copy C is signed "W. Blake" and identified "as pattern", presumably as the model for colouring other copies, and there are at least two patterns of colouring in copies of Young's Night Thoughts , one of c. 1797 and one of c. 1805. If a number of copies of Night Thoughts did pass into Blake's possession, he would have had little difficulty accommodating them when he had a whole house to himself in which to range in Lambeth in 1790-1800 but would have had considerable difficulty transporting them to and from Felpham, where he lived 1800-1803, and storing them in his small flats in London on his return (1803-27). One reason for the difficulty contemporaries experienced in purchasing Blake's Night Thoughts may have been the fact that Blake had no appropriate London shop or house from which to sell them; if he did receive a number of copies at once, he probably had to keep them in a warehouse. Probably one of the most important copies he coloured was that for Earl Spencer, the greatest English collector of his day and a special customer and friend of James Edwards, who was responsible for Richard Edwards's appointment in Minorca. James and Richard Edwards both had special reason to be grateful to Earl Spencer, and his copy was made extra special not only in its colouring but in its binding and in having duplicate, uncoloured engraved titlepages to compare with the coloured ones. 52 Blake had hoped for fame from his Night Thoughts engravings, but, though he must have been paid significant sums for colouring the engraved outlines, he was disappointed in the public response to the book—or rather in the lact of response. On 26 August 1799 he wrote to his friend George Cumberland: I live by Miracle . . . . For as to Engraving in which art I cannot reproach myself with any neglect yet I am laid by in a corner as if I did not Exist &amp; Since my Youngs Night Thoughts have been publishd Even Johnson &amp; Fuseli have discarded my Graver. . . . [ William Blake's Writings , (1978), 1529] The work to which he had devoted years of his time and the best of his genius was a failure in the marketplace and with the critics. There were so few accounts of it during the lifetimes of its publisher and illustrator that they may be recorded in detail. On Sunday 10 March 1811 Crabb Robinson "shewed W[ illiam ]. H[ azlitt ]. Blake's Young. He saw no merit in them as designs" ( Blake Records [1969], 229). Crabb Robinson himself found Blake so remarkable that he wrote an article about him for the first issue of the German periodical called Vaterländisches Museum , in which he said that the engravings are of very unequal merit; sometimes the inventions of the artist rival those of the poet, but often they are only preposterous translations of them, by reason of the unfortunate idea peculiar to Blake, that whatsoever the fancy of the spiritual eye may discern must also be as clearly penetrable to the bodily eye. So Young is literally translated, and his thought turned into a picture. Thus for example the artist represents in a drawing Death treading crowns under foot, the sun reaching down his hand, and the like. Yet these drawings are frequently exquisite. We hear that the publisher has not yet issued a quarter of the drawings delivered to him by the artist and has refused to sell the drawings, although a handsome sum was offered him for them. 53 The "handsome sum" refused for the drawings may be estimated by the £300 asked for them in the 1821 catalogue of Richard Edwards's brother Thomas, though this was reduced to £52.10.0 in his auctions of 1826 and 1828—and still found no buyer. One of the few enthusiasts for the book was Thomas Frognal Dibdin, who wrote: "there are few books of which I love to turn over the leaves, more assiduously and carefully, than 'Young's Night Thoughts,' emblazoned by his [ Blake's ] truly original pencil." 54 In a schoolboy text of Virgil, the editor R. J. Thornton said that "The Illustrations of this English Pastoral are by the famous Blake, the illustrator of Young's Night Thoughts, and Blair's Grave" ( Blake Records , 271), and Charles Lamb identified Blake in a letter of 15 May 1824 as "a most extraordinary man . . . whose wild designs accompany a splendid folio edition of the Night Thoughts." 55 Two final comments of 1830, three years after the deaths of the illustrator and publisher, indicate the ambivalence towards the designs still felt by men of taste a third of a century after they were issued. The first is by Allan Cunningham: "Some of those designs were in keeping with the poems, but there were others which alarmed fastidious people; the serious and the pious were not prepared to admire shapes trembling in nudity round the verses of a grave divine. In the exuberance of Young there are many fine figures; but they are figures of speech only, on which art should waste none of its skill." 56 Whatever faults modern eyes may discover among the beauties of Blake's designs for Young, we are not now normally so reluctant to tolerate shapes trembling in nudity in illustration of exuberant figures of speech. Cunningham's ambivalence is expressed at greater length in Edward Bulwer Lytton's anonymous "Conversation with an Ambitious Student in Ill Health" published in the New Monthly Magazine , XXIX (Dec 1830), 518-519: L. . . . I saw a few days ago, a copy of the 'Night Thoughts,' which he [ Blake ] had illustrated in a manner at once so grotesque, so sublime—now by so literal an interpretation, now by so vague and disconnected a train of invention, that the whole makes one of the most astonishing and curious productions which ever balanced between the conception of genius and the ravings of positive insanity. I remember two or three [ of his illustrations ], but they are not the most remarkable. To these two fine lines— 'Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours, And ask them what report they bore to heaven;' he has given the illustration of one sitting and with an earnest countenance conversing with a small shadowy shape at his knee, while other shapes, of a similar form and aspect, are seen gliding heavenward, each with a scroll in its hands. The effect is very solemn. Again, the line— 'Till death, that mighty hunter, earths them all,' is bodied forth by a grim savage with a huge spear, cheering on fiendish and ghastly hounds, one of which has just torn down, and is griping by the throat, an unfortunate fugitive: the face of the hound is unutterably death-like. The verse— 'We censure Nature for a span too short,' obtains an illustration literal to ridicule.—A bearded man of gigantic statu[ r ]e is spanning an infant with his finger and thumb. Scarcely less literal, but more impressive, is the engraving of the following:— 'When Sense runs savage, broke from Reason's chain, And sings false peace till smother'd by the pall!' You perceive a young female savage, with long locks, wandering alone, and exulting—while above, two bodiless hands extend a mighty pall, that appears about to fall upon the unconscious rejoicer. A. Young was fortunate. He seems almost the only poet who has had his mere metaphors illustrated and made corporeal. [ Blake Records, 401-402 ] No great number of copies of Young's Night Thoughts (1797) was ever in circulation, 57 and Richard Edwards seems scarcely to have attempted to advertise or sell it vigourously. His lassitude about it may have been connected with his personal situation, leaving off business within the year. Few buyers sought for the work, and some of those who did, like Crabb Robinson, had great difficulty finding it. Commercially, the book must have been a failure. As the sparse comments quoted above suggest, it was scarcely a critical success either. Hazlitt the art critic "saw no merit in them as designs", though Dibdin the bibliographer loved looking at the engravings. Most who looked at the designs with care probably thought, as Crabb Robinson, Allan Cunningham, and Bulwer Lytton did, that they were both "preposterous" and "exquisite", at once "grotesque" and "sublime". Almost a century passed before there was an extended and appreciative commentary on the designs, by F. J. Shields in Gilchrist's Life of William Blake (1880), and another century passed after that before all the watercolours were published in a book together, many for the first time (1980). It has been left for the present generation to conclude that Blake's designs for Young's Night Thoughts are among the greatest imaginative feats of that or any age—and that the career of the publisher who called them forth is worth recording in detail. Richard Edwards is a minor member of an important family of booksellers, bookbinders, and publishers. What we know of his shop, his pamphlets, and his career indicates a man not remarkable for ambition, taste, energy, or accomplishment. We do not know when he encountered Blake or why he patronized him—but we do know that his patronage elicited from one of the most astonishing geniuses of the age almost a quarter of his surviving watercolours and by far the most ambitious of his commercial undertakings. The paradox of Richard Edwards's deserved obscurity before 1795 and his apparently unwitting brilliance in commissioning Blake's Night Thoughts designs is as wonderful in its way as the paradox of Blake's grotesque and sublime engravings themselves.</field>

I cannot easily account for his address given in the obituary in the Leeds Intelligencer , 25 Oct 1827: "after only a few days' illness, Richard Edwards Esq of Weybridge, Surrey, youngest son of the late William Edwards of Halifax" (Hanson, p. 275B). Perhaps the information had come from George Payne of Weybridge, who identified Richard Edwards's handwriting in the codicil of his will. 11 See also James Edwards's Catalogue (1785), Bolton, History of . . . Fungusses , II (1798), Bible prospectus (1790), The Book of Common Prayer (1791), M.D., Sacred Poetry (1790), Pinkerton, Medallic History (1790), Carr, Poems (1791), Bibliotheca Parisiana (1791), and Dutens, Table [?1790] published by Edwards &amp; Sons, or by Messrs Edwards, Pall Mall. 12 By May 1792 the publishers Edwards and Parsons had been joined by five others. In all, eighteen publishers were listed in the magazine (seven of them in the provinces), though never more than eleven at once. 13 He was one of four publishers of Joseph Strutt's Dress and Habits of the People of England Vol. I, Parts 1-?8 ([July] 1796-[?Feb 1797]), but the chief publisher of Strutt was probably his brother James. Richard Edwards's name does not appear on the prospectus for Strutt Part 9 (?March 1797) or on the title-page of Vol. II ([?Oct] 1799). 14 This Part I 1797 titlepage is something of an enigma, for it bears (in addition to that of R. Edwards) the names of two publishers ([James] Edwards of Pall Mall and Robinsons of Paternoster Row) who are never recorded on its plates, and it omits all reference to Merigot, whose name is on all the plates with dated imprints. 15 Not counting, of course, his own works in Illuminated Printing, such as Songs of Innocence (1789), The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (?1790-93), and The Book of Urizen (1794) which he coloured and sold in such small numbers that no more than a dozen copies of most have survived. 16 British Critic , VIII (Sept 1796), 277—see Blake Records (1969), 54-55. The design reprobated illustrates Night Thoughts but is not from Blake's suite of designs for Richard Edwards. 17 Book of Urizen (1794), pl. 4—see William Blake's Writings (1978), 243. 18 Blake did engrave one small folio duplicate plate for the Boydell Shakspeare in 1799, and he had made a splendid folio engraving for Boydell after Hogarth's Beggar's Opera painting in 1788. 19 His great series of illustrations for the works of other men were all in the future: Young (1794-97), Gray (1797), The Bible (1799 ff.), Milton (1800 ff.), Job (1818-26), Bunyan (?1824), and Dante (1824-27). He had engraved six of his own rather tame designs for Mary Wollstonecraft's Original Stories published by Joseph Johnson in 1791. 20 "When Flaxman was taken to Italy [ 1787-94 ], Fuseli was giv'n to me for a season", Blake letter of 12 Sept 1800 ( William Blake's Writings [1978], 1537). The anonymous "Explanation of the Engravings" in the 1797 Night Thoughts has been tentatively attributed to Fuseli (e.g., in Blake Books [1977], 638). 21 1826 and 1828 Thomas Edwards catalogues; the 1821 catalogue refers to "the Author's original Copy", singular. 22 1821 Thomas Edwards catalogue (not repeated in those of 1826 and 1828): "The Bookbinder from inattention lost the blank leaf with the Author's signature." Since there was only one "Author's signature" in the nine parts, presumably in Night I, we may wonder whether Nights II-IX had belonged to Edward Young, particularly since some are not first editions. 23 As Hanson suggests (p. 266).

The 1821 catalogue says "they occupied nearly two years of the time" of Blake, and the unreliable Allan Cunningham says vaguely, "The name of Blake now [ 1794 ] began to be known a little, and Edwards, the bookseller, employed him to illustrate Young's Night Thoughts" ( Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects [1830], II, paragraph 19—see Blake Records [1969], 487). Note that Richard Edwards apparently published nothing in 1794 save Alexander's Croup , probably initiated by James Edwards. 27 Occasionally the line asterisked in the 1797 text as engraved is not the same as the line ticked for the same design in the watercolour. In the text with the watercolours, some lines are underlined, corrected, or annotated in crayon. 28 J. T. Smith, Nollekens and His Times (1828)—see Blake Records (1969), 461. For the £21 price, see Fuseli's comment on 24 June 1796 below. 29 10 May 1826 Thomas Edwards sale, lot 1076; the opinion of "the late Mr. Fuseli" (d. 1825) is not recorded elsewhere. Thomas Edwards's 1828 catalogue, lot 1130, said: " It is scarcely possible to present the collector with an adequate, or even faint idea of the singular nature of these most extraordinary and sublime conceptions of the artist. . . . In point of composition and design, the present production is certainly superior [ to his designs for 'Blair's Grave'], and is alone sufficient to immortalize the name of Blake as an artist of the highest order ." The designs were first made publicly visible when they were given in 1929 to the British Museum Print Room, but they were not reproduced all together until 1980, when scores were reproduced for the first time in William Blake's Designs for Edward Young's Night Thoughts, ed. D. V. Erdman, J. E. Grant, E. J. Rose, &amp; Michael Tolley (1980). 30 For designs similar to those in Night Thoughts , see William Blake's Writings (1978), 5, 8, 13, 40, 96, 230, 633, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1119, 1138, 1157, 1234, 1241, 1292, 1728. 31 Allan Cunningham, The Cabinet Gallery of Pictures (1833), I, 11-13—see Blake Records (1969), 183; the paragraphing is mine. 32 Quoted from the complete transcript of The Diary of Joseph Farington , ed. K. Garlick &amp; A. Macintyre, Vol. I-VI (1978-79), mostly verified from the manuscript in the Royal Library, Windsor. 33 See "Young's Night Thoughts (London: R. Edwards, 1797): A New Unillustrated State", Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly , XIV (1980), 34-35, describing a copy with the initials J E which may have belonged to James Edwards. 34 Blake was paid £5.5.0 apiece for his much smaller outlines for Flaxman's Iliad (1805) and Hesiod (1817), and on 19 Aug 1841 Flaxman wrote to T. H. Whitaker that "outline . . . engraving including the Copper plate will cost 6 Guineas if done by M r . Blake the best engraver of outlines" ( Blake Records [1969], 152, 579-80, 233). 35 A single engraving for Night V was offered in the William Blake catalogue (?1930) of Francis Edwards (no relation to Edwards of Halifax), but it has not since been traced. 36 We may be fairly confident that Blake had not seen the 1797 printed text before he began his engravings, for had he done so he surely would have filled the blank spaces on the short pages at the end of each Night. In the engravings for these pages, the boxes left for the text are much larger than the text in them, leaving ugly, irrelevant blank windows. 37 Blake coloured one set each of Hayley's Ballads (1805), Virgil, Pastorals (1821), and his own Job (1826) but did not do so for his other series of engraved designs in commercial books: Mary Wollstonecraft, Original Stories (1791), Burger, Leonora (1796), Hayley, Designs to A Series of Ballads (1802). Numerous copies of Stedman's Surinam (1796; 1806; 1813) including Blake's engravings after Stedman have been commercially coloured (not by Blake), and an advertisement claimed that the plates in The Wit's Magazine (1784) including those by Blake, were available in colour, but none has been recorded, and Blake is unlikely to have coloured them in any case. A copy of Blake's designs to Blair's Grave (1813) with "hand colored" engravings is recorded by Robert N. Essick, "New Information on Blake's Illuminated Books", Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly , XV (1981), 13, without identification of the hand which coloured the plates. 38 D. V. Erdman et al seem to think that The Historic Gallery belonged to James Edwards ( William Blake's Designs for Edward Young's Night Thoughts, I [1980], 87). 39 See R. R. Wark, "A Minor Blake Conundrum", Huntington Library Quarterly , XXI (1957), 83-87; the fine copy was probably not made by Blake, for the walking staff has been unaccountably omitted from the naked pilgrim's upraised hand. The vellum text is that of 1797 in a variant (probably proof) state, most of the differences being in capitals. 40 Blake Records (1969), 169, 172, 192-193. It is notable that they were not exhibited at the Royal Academy annual exhibitions, perhaps because the Royal Academy then excluded watercolours as they did later. 41 Quoted from the original in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera in Bodley; see Blake Records (1969), 59. 42 Memoirs and Recollections of the Late Abraham Raimbach, Esq. Engraver , ed. M.T.S. Raimbach (1843), 22; see Blake Records (1969), 58. 43 Ozias Humphry was an important collector of Blake's works—he may just have acquired a number of them (see "Ozias Humphry, William Upcott, and William Blake", Humanities Association Review , XXVI [1975], 116-122)—and Richard Cosway was a friend of Blake's, but there is no known direct connection between Blake and Benjamin West or Robert Smirke. 44 British Library Add. MSS 39,780, f. 212; the letter is a draft, and the recipient is unidentified. 45 Edwards seems to have provided 900 pages (450 half-sheets) of 1794 J Whatman paper, but, as there were only 537 drawings requiring 269 half-sheets, there should have been some 362 pages or 181 half sheets left over. This surplus Blake used for proofs of the engravings of Night Thoughts (47 leaves in Vala , 24 in Harvard) and, presumably after 1797 when it was clear that no more engravings or proofs would be needed, for the fair copy of his Vala (19 leaves), for his Gray designs about 1797 (58 leaves), and perhaps for printing his own illuminated works (over 100 leaves in Visions of the Daughters of Albion [copies F, G], America [A-B], Europe [A, C], and Urizen [B, D]). This presumes the accuracy of Farington's report of what Fuseli remembered, and this is somewhat suspect, since the flyer mentions 150 engravings and Fuseli 200. 46 He must, however, be responsible for the unexplained omission of a block of 58 lines of Young's poem. 47 "Public Address" in Blake's Notebook , p. 25—see William Blake's Writings (1978), 1052. Thomas Edwards's 1821 catalogue repeated Richard Edwards's claim: "This work is, perhaps, unequalled for the boldness of conception, and spirit of execution [ i.e. , spirited execution?] exhibited in the masterly designs of Mr. Blake." 48 "Many People are So foolish [ as ] to think they can wound Mr Fuseli over my Shoulder[ ; ] they will find themselves mistaken" ("Public Address" in Blake's Notebook p. 53—see William Blake's Writings [1978], 1033). 49 British Library Add. MSS 39,790, ff. 3-4, undated (watermark: 1795) and unaddressed; in the letter she says she has seen the Hares on their return from France and Germany—and the Hares reached London by 1 Nov and stayed there until 4 Nov 1797 (J. C. A. Hare, Memorials of a Quiet Life [1872], 127-129). 50 [Crabb Robinson] "William Blake Künstler, Dichter, und Religiöser Schwärmer", Vaterländisches Museum , I (1811): "gar nicht mehr in Buchladen zu haben, so wie überhaupt äusserst selten geworden ist", echoed by F. A. Ebert, Allgemeines Bibliographisches Lexikon , II (1830): "nicht mehr im Handel zu habend und äusserst selten ist" (tr. A. Brown [1837]: "no longer to be met with in the market and is extremely scarce"—see Blake Records , 453, 441, 375-376). Crabb Robinson did buy a copy of Blake's Night Thoughts on 27 Dec 1810 for £1.11.6 ( Blake Records , 578), slightly more than the £1.5.0 per Part advertised. 51 See Blake Books (1977), 642-646, 956-957, recording the provenance of twenty coloured copies; two more are known, one in Detroit Public Library and one in private hands. Un coloured copies were owned by Blake's contemporaries William Godwin, Joseph Thomas, Robert Scott, Louis or Nicholas Schiavonetti (96 loose plates), William Thane (a copy of Blair's Grave extra-illustrated with plates from Young), and Caroline Bowles (later Southey) ( Blake Records [1969], 41n3, 166, 193, 227n1, 398n1). 52 Blake etched a private portrait of Earl Spencer about 1813. 53 Blake Records , 433; Ebert ( op. cit. ), echoing Robinson again, says that Blake's designs for Young, "although very unequal, are yet often of superior merit, but express the unfortunate idea of wishing to interpret Young literally" ( Blake Records , 376). Far from issuing 25% of Blake's designs, Edwards had published only about 8% of them. 54 T. F. Dibdin, Reminiscences of a Literary Life (1836), 784-789—see Blake Records , 243. In his Library Companion (1824), 734, Dibdin wrote: "I love to read that portion of the poem, published in folio form, with the bizarre but original and impressive ornaments by Blake" ( Blake Records , 289). 55 Blake Records , 284. The obituary of Blake in the Gentleman's Magazine , XCVIII (Oct 1827), 337-338 ( Blake Records , 356) was the only one to take note of his designs for Night Thoughts . 56 Allan Cunningham, Life of Blake in his Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1830), II, paragraph 19—see Blake Records , 487. Cunningham speaks of "poems", plural, because the Night Thoughts was originally issued as nine self-contained poems. 57 In a fairly extensive search on five continents, I have located over seventy copies in public collections, and perhaps there are no more than two or three times this total in private hands. It is by no means a rare book, but it is not common.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Faulkner's 1962 Gold Medal Speech by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Faulkner delivered his last public acceptance speech in New York City on May 24th, 1962, less than six weeks before his death. 1 The occasion was the awarding to him of the Gold Medal for Fiction by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Academy of Arts and Letters. Recalling the ceremony, the distinguished critic Malcolm Cowley assessed Faulkner's speech with prescient, almost prophetic intuitiveness: "Faulkner's acceptance . . . had a tone of retrospection, of lament for the dignity and freedom of the past, that was not exactly new for him, but that seemed to have a new resonance. He compared his own gold medal with those that used to be awarded to products displayed at Leipzig, St. Louis, and other world's fairs." 2 Indeed, if Faulkner's tone, as conveyed in a prose style which by then had long become synonymous with his name, was "not exactly new for him," its "resonance" was. But at that time, neither Cowley nor any other individual except the one man who had collaborated in writing Faulkner's acceptance speech, could have known that its resonance owed a substantial measure of indebtedness to the typewritten draft from which Faulkner had drawn his thematic inspiration: a version of the speech composed at his own suggestion by Faulkner's young friend, Joseph L. Blotner, assistant Professor of English at the University of Virginia during and after the academic years of 1957 and 1958 when Faulkner was Writer-in-Residence at that institution. Nor, for that matter, at the time he was drafting his version of the speech Faulkner would utilize, could Blotner himself have realized he would be co-conspiring in a pattern to which Faulkner had resorted at least twice before. Only during the last years of the sixties, while Blotner was gathering information for Faulkner: A Biography , would he discover that Faulkner previously had sought the assistance of Abram Minell in penning his October 2, 1959, speech to the 7th Annual Conference of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO; and that two years prior, Faulkner had coerced Duncan Emrich, Cultural Affairs Officer for the State Department's International Educational Exchange Service in Greece, into writing the speech he would deliver on March 28, 1957, upon receiving the Silver Medal of the Athens Academy. 3 Clearly, during the last twelve years of his life, Faulkner seemed to regard literary, civic, and humanitarian accolades bestowed upon him as perfunctory and ephemeral afterthoughts or footnotes to his writing career. And, with few exceptions, the obligatory oratory which was required for him to win deliverance from each award ceremony would be as tediously bothersome and uninspired to compose as it appeared painful for him to deliver publicly. Yet, with uneasy resolve, out of patriotic or professional sense of duty, he repeatedly acquiesced to conventional, formal protocol. If only a few of his public utterances, most notably his Nobel Prize, "Never Be Afraid," and "Delta Council" speeches achieved oratorical and rhetorical eloquence worthy of universal acclaim, the others, at least, were idiosyncratically Faulknerian in prose style, tone, and attitude; even one like the 1962 Gold Medal speech upon which he had unabashedly collaborated. Faulkner predictably was here a fastidious craftsman striving to make his prose uniquely, distinctively, his own, despite the highly derivative nature of its motifs and image clusters. Indeed, in this case, his most compelling task was to impose his "Faulknerian" style on the imitation in which the draft had been written. Accomplishing this required four revisions before he could feel satisfied that he had adequately transmuted Blotner's original into his own personal expression. Actually, the document from which Faulkner initially worked, a two-page ribbon typescript with corrections in blue ink, was Blotner's revised draft of his own initial two-leaf, three-page, blue-ink holograph rendering. On the verso of the second leaf of this holograph, Blotner has written the following explanatory comments referring to the diarylike pencil notations he had made on this same page twenty-five years before: "I made these pencil notes after William Faulkner told me, on one of his periodic visits to my office in the English Department in Cabell Hall at the University of Virginia, that he had to write an acceptance speech when he received the Gold Medal for Fiction from the National Institute of Arts and Letters. This was April 27, 1962. When he said 'I hate to swot up a speech for that Gold Medal,' I volunteered to write one for him. I wrote the draft version in blue ink and then gave him the black ribbon typescript version when he visited my office again on May 4. When he returned on May 8, he gave the typescript back to me and the carbon typescript of his final version of the speech. 'Here's your copy,' he said. 'Maybe you can make some money out of it sometime.' He delivered the speech on May 24, 1962 in New York." I acquired these three documents from Joseph Blotner in early April 1987. A phone call to Ms. Nancy Johnson, Librarian of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, was rewarded by a letter confirming that the Academy did have on file the ribbon typescript of Faulkner's Gold Medal speech for 1962. 4 The accompanying xerox copy proved to be identical to the carbon typescript Faulkner had given Blotner on May 8, 1962, except that the Academy's copy carried in Faulkner's hand in blue-black ink the superscription, "Speech of William Faulkner for May 24th." Regarding the speech, Ms. Johnson wrote: "I looked through the correspondence files again and there is nothing at all to indicate that there was any other version of this speech. Miss Geffen's requests for an advance copy apparently went unanswered. It seems that Mr. Faulkner brought this typescript with him and left it here following the award presentation." In point of fact, the complete census of extant manuscripts of Faulkner's 1962 acceptance speech upon receiving the Gold Medal for Fiction numbers seven documents, of which six are textually variant. The Brodsky Collection contains Joseph Blotner's three-page holograph original draft [A] and his revised two-page, hand-corrected, ribbon typescript [B]. The one-page, blue-ink holograph manuscript which Faulkner himself drafted after reading Blotner's text and adopting it as his prototype [C], and two sequentially advancing one-page authorial ribbon typescript revisionary drafts with holograph corrections [D &amp; E] are part of the Faulkner Collections at the University of Virginia's Alderman Library. 5 The last typescript version in this sequence, the one-page ribbon copy [F] from which Faulkner read to its attending members, and then deposited there, resides in the files of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. The carbon typescript [G] of this reading version, formerly in the possession of Joseph Blotner, is located in the Brodsky Collection. 6 Transcribed below in order of composition are Blotner's ribbon typescript version [B], Faulkner's holograph first attempt at composing his own rendition [C] on the basis of [B], followed by the carbon typescript [G] of the final version revised from [E]. Joseph Blotner's text is presented without textual apparatus but incorporates all his intended deletions and additions as though it were a fair-typed copy. Faulkner's holograph is transcribed according to a system invented by Fredson Bowers for dealing with alterations in manuscripts. 7 The typed final version is transcribed as delivered, its typed revisions (no hand alterations) listed as footnotes. A full collation of all variants (except typos) in [D] and [E] is appended keyed to the final version [F-G], which for convenience of reference has been printed line-for-line with the original. All listed revisions in [D] and [E] are in ink unless specified as typed, and the listing includes all deletions and additions to enable the documents to be reconstructed. To this collation has been added for the reader's convenience in following the progress of the revision the variants in the final text of the holograph [C] but its alterations—being noted in the transcript itself—are not included descriptively in the collation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[B] Blotner's Typescript Version / Brodsky Collection This award is to me a source of double pleasure, in that it is not simply a recognition of work done over long years in a demanding craft, but also because of itself apart, by its name and nature, it recognizes, I think, qualities most worthy of the artist's striving and man's cherishing. The substance of which the tangible embodiment of this award is formed can suggest many things: a system of finance, a long-gone politician's frenetic oratory, or the self-induced catastrophe of a mad king. But in the present context it suggests to me other, utterly different things. It is redolent of the past, of those distant days of quasi-innocence when the world's fairs at which medals were awarded were rare and almost magical happenings and not giant commercial enterprises occuring more often than presidential elections. It suggests not just the faded airs and rotogravures that record the vanished splendor which briefly crowned St. Louis or Leipzig. It evokes the qualities they celebrated, immortalized thereafter on labels identifying everything from great vintages to nonpareil pickle relishes. I think that those gold medals—and their cousin-german counterparts, the shining blue ribbons that glittered on the tables of myriad forgotten county fairs—recognized qualities which, though they are still present today when the earth is worked like a mine and the factories begin to be worked by machines, were more clearly seen and more highly honored than they are today. Apart from the old testamental virtues, venerated in colony and frontier, these qualities cluster around the idea of individuality of a kind of excellence compounded of resourcefulness, independence, and complete uniqueness. So, today when roads get shorter and neighbors closer, needs better provided for and range more circumscribed, it seems to me a good time to remember the qualities denoted by the gold medals of the last century. And I think it is vital for them to be a part of the artist and his work—for him and for those who read it—individuality and independence, to go beside the other qualities in the hierarchy that makes up man's best virtues, the pride and pity, the honor and compassion that sustain him in his life.</field>
