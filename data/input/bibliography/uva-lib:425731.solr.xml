      <field name="heading_text">A Description of Descriptive Bibliography by G. Thomas Tanselle *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1923 R. Austin Freeman published "The Apparition of Burling Court," one of his Dr. Thorndyke stories, in which the learned doctor, journeying by train out of London with his companion, examines a book en route. 1 "First," we are told, he made an exhaustive examination of the cover; scrutinised the corners; inspected the bottom edges and compared them with the top edges; and compared the top and bottom head-caps. Then he brought out his lens and examined the tooling, which was simple in character and worked in "blind" —i.e., not gilt. He also inspected the head-bands through the glass, and then he turned his attention to the interior. He looked carefully at both end-papers, he opened the sections and examined the sewing-thread, he held the leaves up to the light and tested the paper by eye and by touch and he viewed the writing in several places through his lens. (p. 831) Although it is not Thorndyke's purpose to write a bibliographical description, he is engaging here in some of the analysis required to produce such a description; and his companion, who narrates the story, does present us with the beginnings of a physical description. The cover, he says, is "rusty calf," the paper "laid," with "very distinct wire-lines but no water-mark" (p. 832). Some of the physical features of the book arouse Thorndyke's suspicion: the fact that the edges and joints of the binding "are not more worn than the sides" and that the leaves are not more oxidized at the edges but "are equally discoloured all over" (p. 834). When he and his companion return to his laboratory, they test the paper further and find that it consists of "Mechanical wood fibre, with some esparto, a little cotton and a few linen fibres." "Then," Thorndyke concludes, "it is a modern paper. Mechanical wood-pulp—prepared by Keller's process—was first used in paper-making in 1840. . . . and esparto was not used until 1860" (p. 835). The paper was made more than twenty years after the purported date of the writing in the book. This fictional episode anticipates by eleven years a famous real-life announcement of the similar detection of a bibliographical crime. When John Carter and Graham Pollard published in 1934 their evidence for condemning as spurious certain pamphlets by nineteenth-century authors (now known as the Wise-Forman forgeries), the presence of esparto in the paper was a major element in their demonstration (along with an analysis of the type faces). 2 One is not surprised to learn that in the same year Carter mentioned the Dr. Thorndyke stories in a pioneering essay on the collecting of detective fiction. 3 The more significant link between the two discoveries of forgery, however, is the recognition—illustrated by both—of the role of physical evidence in evaluating the status of written and printed language. Thorndyke was concerned with a handwritten book and Carter and Pollard with printed pamphlets, but in each case the starting point for a critical approach to the language conveyed by an artifact was an examination of the physical characteristics of that artifact. The results are not often so dramatic as the revelation of forgery; but the possibility of forgery, always present even if not always likely, underscores the way in which our assessment of the relative reliability of texts is tied to our evaluation of all the evidence present in the artifacts carrying those texts. Even when a manuscript or printed book is authentic as a whole, some of the clues it contains to its own production history may call into question various elements of the text or suggest how textual errors might be corrected. Texts come to us either through oral tradition or in tangible form as parts of physical objects; and the investigation and recording of all that can be learned about such objects is thus fundamental to the appreciation of a major segment of our cultural heritage. What has come to be known as descriptive bibliography is a genre of writing that aims to set forth the physical characteristics and production history of the objects that we call books. 4 That such a type of historical writing exists should not seem surprising. Artifacts that survive provide our tangible link with the human past, and they must all be of intense interest to anyone concerned with that past. It seems natural that human beings should pore over the objects they inherit, noting down their measurements, colors, and designs and attempting to read in them the story of their production and the meanings they held for their producers—just as Belzoni, in Emerson's words, "digs and measures in the mummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes." 5 We regard it as perfectly normal that people write verbal accounts of the physical properties of paintings and drawings, buildings and sculptures, vases and goblets. Because these works of art and craft use physical media, any comments on their physical characteristics are comments on their artistry as well and are thus a form of art criticism. Books, however, are not as commonly approached in physical terms, as constituents of material culture, since they exist largely for the purpose of transmitting verbal (or musical or choreographic) texts; 6 and many persons who wish to read and appreciate those texts do not consider the physical aspects of books relevant to their concerns. As the narrator of the Thorndyke story noted, "An ordinary person would have opened the book and looked through the contents" (p. 831), not examining its physical features, which would not be regarded as part of its "contents." People use the word "book" to refer to a verbal work more often than to a physical object. A few years ago the comic strip Nancy showed Sluggo writing the phrase "Rectangular, smooth and heavy," whereupon Nancy disdainfully comments, "When it says 'Describe the book,' I think they mean the story." The suggested superciliousness of her remark implies that any sensible person ought to know how irrelevant the shape and feel of a book are. Like the average person, she sees the ambiguity of the term "book" and yet immediately dismisses one of its meanings. The fact that the cartoonist expected this exchange to amuse his readers reflects his assumption that they would side with Nancy in finding Sluggo's response naïve. Sluggo's final comment—"I thought that one sounded too good to be true"—reinforces another aspect of the standard attitude by implying that the description of physical details is mechanical and straightforward—that is, "easy"—in contrast to the supposedly more difficult and challenging task of accounting for plot, characterization, and ideas. 7 This cluster of misconceptions is the greatest obstacle that descriptive bibliographers face in explaining their work to an audience larger than their fellow specialists; indeed, so widespread are those misunderstandings that even some bibliographers themselves seem to be unaware of the full significance of what they are doing. Most readers, if they pay any attention at all to the physical features of the books they read, do not connect those details to their attempt at associating meaning with the verbal texts they find in the books. (This failure to see the significance of the physicality of texts is equally characteristic of those who believe that meanings are lodged in texts by authors and those who believe they are placed there by readers.) Presumably many readers do recognize—or would quickly do so if they gave thought to the matter—that the design of any book is worthy of study as a reflection of the taste of its time, as an indication of the stature of the author and genre represented in it, and as a clue to the nature of the audience expected for it. They would then assume that specialized studies of these matters must exist but that such work constitutes a byway of literary history, not a field of central importance to the majority of readers of books. In the first of these assumptions they would be correct, but not in the second. A large number of descriptive bibliographies do exist, recording—in varying degrees of detail—information about the paper, typography, layout, binding, and structure of particular books and thus bringing together in orderly fashion some of the evidence on which histories of printing and publishing practices, of graphic arts, of authors' careers, and of reading tastes must rest. In performing this task, they obviously make a valuable contribution to scholarship; and in recent decades the growth of l'histoire du livre , the historical study of the impact of books on society, has from time to time brought increased attention to the kinds of details that have long been examined by bibliographers. 8 But if descriptive bibliographies served no further function, their neglect by most readers would be understandable. The information they provide, however, is intimately related to evaluating the texts of the books described, and texts are what readers are interested in. The very arrangement of most descriptive bibliographies of authors reflects an emphasis on texts, for the commonest plan is to take up successive printings and editions of one work before moving on to the next work. Chronology of an author's whole career yields to a series of separate histories of the presentation of the texts of particular works—in each of which chronology may be further violated by treating together the successive printings of one edition (the copies resulting from one setting of type or act of keyboarding) before proceeding to the printings of the next edition. The classification—into editions and printings—of all copies of books purporting to present the text of the same work is a basic function of descriptive bibliographies and a prerequisite for the study of textual history. Although textual relationships do not necessarily coincide with the chronology of editions (since any edition may of course be based on a text other than that of the immediately preceding edition), a knowledge of what editions and printings exist is the starting point for any study of the textual history of a work, and thus for any historical approach to the reading and interpretation of that work. Some bibliographies contain details about textual variants, and some have left such information to the editors of scholarly editions, who naturally must report it. This situation reflects the symbiotic relationship between descriptive bibliographies and scholarly editions: both rest on the same research, the same body of physical evidence. The texts of printed books are physical, consisting of inked letter-forms on paper or a similar surface; and studies of books as physical objects cannot logically avoid reporting on the texts in them. On practical grounds, however, they may sometimes legitimately omit such details in order to avoid duplication, if a thorough edition has already accounted for the textual variants or is about to do so. Under other circumstances, if bibliographers fail to comment on textual variants, both within and between editions, one must suspect them of not understanding the relation of physical evidence to reading. Some bibliographers, despite their having elected to spend substantial portions of their lives recording physical details about books, share with the bulk of the human race a confusion about how books work, about where verbal statements (or musical or choreographic ones) actually exist. This confusion is symbolized by what goes on in many research libraries, where in one part of the building brittle books are microfilmed and the originals discarded, while in another area, usually called a department of "rare books" or "special collections," books are housed with great care, regardless of how brittle they are, in an effort to preserve them. The former activity implies that photocopies of texts are equivalent to the originals and thus ignores the role of physical evidence in reading; the gathering of material into "rare-book" rooms, on the other hand, seems to suggest a recognition of the importance of artifactual evidence. The two activities rest on contradictory assumptions, and the library profession has been no more successful than the reading public in constructing a coherent rationale that encompasses them both. 9 There can in fact be no way to justify on rational grounds the notion that some artifacts are intrinsically less deserving of preservation than others or that the reading of the physical evidence in books is irrelevant to the reading of the texts in them. The fame of an author and the market value of a book, two linked factors that determine much of the content of "rare-book" collections, have nothing to do with the process of reading or the usefulness of books as historical evidence. Reading the text of any book—whether it consists of notations for words, sounds, or movements—must entail the reading of all the evidence the book contains, not simply the inked notations on its pages. Those notations, after all, are not in most cases ends in themselves but rather the means for reconstructing works of language, music, or dance; and any evidence that can help one to judge the accuracy 10 of those notations is relevant to the ultimate aim of experiencing works , not simply particular texts of them. The uncritical acceptance by most readers (including literary critics) of the texts that happen to be present in the particular copies of books they are reading implies a belief that literary works exist within books and thus reflects a failure to distinguish works from texts. The only works that can reside in physical form are those that use tangible media, as works of painting, sculpture, and architecture do; in those cases physical objects are indeed the works, and sometimes works of this kind, such as engravings or lithographs, do occur between the covers of books. But works that are sequential rather than stationary, as verbal, musical, and choreographic works are, obviously employ intangible media and thus cannot exist as physical objects; in these cases, physical objects like books are used as a means of preserving instructions for the repetition of the works—a means that, despite its potentiality for error, is likely to be more reliable than oral tradition. 11 Books themselves are works of graphic art and may of course be studied as such; but a large majority of them are also utilitarian objects that serve to convey written directions for recreating dances, pieces of music, and verbal statements (including the ones we call literature). Those directions, not being the works themselves, may at any point be inaccurate reflections of the works; and every feature of the objects carrying such texts—whether present by design or by chance—is potentially significant for judging how those texts came to be what they are and why they were interpreted as they were in the past. Historically minded readers—those interested in readers' responses as well as those interested in authorial intention—along with those not interested in any historical approach must read all the physical clues that books have to offer, not just the inked letterforms, in an effort to decide how the texts should—for their purposes—be constituted. This kind of critical reading (different from what is commonly meant by "critical reading") does not convert literature into a tangible art (though there are of course instances of mixed-media works, like concrete poems, that do combine the verbal with the visual). Rather, this reading of physical evidence provides the basis for freeing oneself from the limitations of particular objects, from the contingencies of the single past moment reflected in each artifact. All readers, regardless of their degree of interest in history, must equally face the possibility of altering the texts they encounter, even though the arguments by which they reach their decisions on the matter may be very different. It is for these reasons that descriptive bibliography, by recording and analyzing the physical features of books, contributes directly to the process of reading and is thus a crucial cultural activity. The gradual growth in the understanding of the connections between physical and intellectual aspects of books—between the processes of book production and the states of texts—is one of the fascinating (and neglected) stories in the history of thought. It is largely a story of the twentieth century, though foreshadowings can—as in any history—be located. The textual criticism of manuscripts goes back to antiquity, and from time to time over the centuries editors have used some of the physical characteristics of manuscripts (such as spacing and lineation or shifts in ink and handwriting) to support arguments for needed textual corrections. This flickering recognition of the significance of physical evidence in reading was not readily transferred to printed books—understandably, because textual scholarship in the early centuries of printing was primarily directed toward writings that had been initially disseminated in manuscript form. By the eighteenth century, however, some scholars began to look at the earliest printed books as examples of printing. Michael Maittaire, Joseph Ames, William Herbert, and G. W. F. Panzer, in their various works that spanned the century, arranged incunabula by year or by printer, rather than by author or genre of writing, and thus emphasized the artifactual aspects of books. 12 Thomas Bennet in 1715 used typographical evidence (such as the spacing and damage of types) to order several sixteenth-century editions (the variously titled 1571 editions of the "thirty-nine articles of religion"). 13 The editing of Shakespeare, which was undertaken several times in the eighteenth century, also directed some attention to the details of specific printed editions, and one Shakespeare editor, Edward Capell, engaged in the practice of transcribing printed title pages, indicating line endings and imitating type styles—a practice that became, more than a century later, a standard feature of bibliographical description. Because the function of these typographical exercises was not clearly articulated, it has been easy for some people to regard them as instances of "mere antiquarianism." 14 But antiquarianism is never "mere," even if some antiquarians do not have a conscious and coherent rationale for their activities: an interest in the details of artifacts, as reflected in Capell's transcriptions, indicates a sense, however undeveloped on a conscious level, of the fundamental role that objects must play in forming our sense of the past. The evolution of bibliophily from the collecting of works (that is, any copies of the texts of selected works) to the collecting of texts (that is, specific copies) is at once the triumph of antiquarianism and the prerequisite for the serious study of the transmission of verbal works. 15 Among the precursors of twentieth-century descriptive bibliography, the most important by far was Henry Bradshaw, librarian of Cambridge University from 1867 to 1886. His approach to books and manuscripts was founded on a study of their physical structure, of the way sheets had been folded to form the conjugate leaves that made up the sewn gatherings in them; he explored the relation of this structure to the texts on the pages thus formed, and in the early 1860s he developed a collation formula to express concisely the number of conjugate leaves in each gathering of a book and the number of sheets (or part-sheets) required to make up those leaves—a formula that, modified by Greg and Bowers, is still in use today. He also demonstrated that one could classify incunabula as to source and date by examining the characteristics of the typography in them, not only the types themselves but also the peculiarities in their deployment, and in this activity he foreshadowed some of the compositorial studies of later analytical bibliographers. 16 After his death in 1886, his insights and methods affected the work of several scholars—as can be observed before the turn of the century in the collation formulas of Falconer Madan and W. A. Copinger and, most notably, in the identification of the printers of fifteenth-century books by Robert Proctor. 17 The Bibliographical Society, founded in London in 1892 with Copinger as president, became the organized force that stimulated the growth of this approach to books; under its aegis, a great triumvirate of bibliographical scholars, A. W. Pollard, R. B. McKerrow, and W. W. Greg, led many others to see the connection between the physical and intellectual aspects of books and to help develop during the first half of the twentieth century a field that came to be called the "New Bibliography." 18 The work of these scholars, motivated in large part by an interest in establishing the texts of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, involved such analytical practices as the tabulation of variant spellings and of identifiable types in an effort to link sections of text with particular typesetters and to determine the order in which pages of type had been set and printed. This kind of work is now usually called "analytical bibliography" and is associated in many people's minds with scholarly editing, not with printing and publishing history or with descriptive bibliography. Yet any conclusions that can be drawn about printing-shop processes from clues found in books are contributions to printing history, and analysis of physical details must underlie the description of the physical product as a whole. 19 Analytical bibliographers need not have as their goal the writing of full-fledged descriptions, but descriptive bibliographers must always engage in analysis (and examine previous relevant analyses). Analytical bibliography results in specialized articles and books; descriptive bibliography results in comprehensive accounts. The intimate connections between them, and between each of them and editing, are epitomized in the work of Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg: their textual interests led them to establish patterns not only for analytical bibliography but for descriptive as well. Pollard and Greg presented a pioneering paper on descriptive bibliography to the Bibliographical Society in December 1906; Pollard published another basic essay the following year; Greg produced a classic piece on the collation formula in 1934; the two of them framed the half-century with magisterial descriptive works containing important introductions, Pollard's first volume of the British Museum incunable catalogue (1908) and Greg's bibliography of the pre-Restoration English drama (1939-59); and McKerrow, in An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), provided what turned out to be the most widely read and cited treatment of bibliographical description before mid-century. 20 It was from this tradition that Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description emerged in 1949. Bowers's great book was a creative synthesis, consolidating what had gone before and adding to it. Every statement in the book presupposes the value of descriptive bibliography as a branch of historical scholarship and affirms the importance, for the study of the past, of placing on record the details that characterize the various objects called books. As Bowers says at the outset, a descriptive bibliography treats a series of books "so that the relations of their texts are clarified and the method of publication of all forms of each individual volume is determined" (p. 16, in italics); a bibliography aims "to present all the evidence about a book which can be determined by analytical bibliography applied to a material object" (p. 34). 21 His book provides a model both for thinking about the subject at large and for handling the multitude of individual situations that can arise: it is the central document of its field, and not likely to be supplanted. Its arrival on the scene was not greeted with unalloyed enthusiasm, however, and the misgivings it aroused in some people are profoundly significant for understanding the peculiarly divided history of the field. 22 The key illustration is perhaps offered by the March 1953 meeting of the Bibliographical Society in London, where Geoffrey Keynes delivered an address, "Religio Bibliographici," summing up his "aims and beliefs as an amateur." 23 One might have expected Keynes, as the author (at that time) of eight acclaimed bibliographies and the president of the society that had fostered the growth of scholarly bibliography, to welcome Bowers's book; instead, he held it responsible for a "shadow which seems in recent years to have descended over our amiable bibliographical discipline." The publication of the Principles , he said, "brought home to our consciousness the fact that what we had thought in our innocence was a pleasant, if sometimes exacting, pastime, was in fact a prime example of 'pure scholarship,' to be pursued with the mind of a detective, the spiritual temperature of an iceberg, and the precision of a machine" (p. 374). 24 Although Keynes did wish to contribute to "the sum of knowledge" (p. 391), he did not, strangely enough, seem to understand that any bibliographer, amateur or professional, with such an aim must strive to work at the highest level of precision and rigorous thinking—nor did he see that this approach does not exclude humanity from the work. 25 His complaint that academic bibliographers "exaggerate the claims of bibliography until it comes to be an end rather than a means" (p. 377) 26 illustrates the unresolved dilemma in his own mind: he felt that " bibliophily is not enough " (p. 386) but held back from making it the basis of "pure scholarship," not fully realizing that bibliophily and scholarship coalesce when one understands the artifactual basis for historical study. 27 Whether scholarship is an end in itself is a fruitless question that can be asked in every field of endeavor; but Keynes seemed unable to conceive of bibliography as scholarship in the first place. If Bowers represents par excellence the tradition of descriptive bibliography as historical scholarship, Keynes symbolizes another strand that runs through the history of the field. The division is not really between professionals and amateurs but between those who do and those who do not bring to books an understanding of the fundamental importance of the physical evidence in all artifacts. The contrast between Bowers and Keynes in the mid-twentieth century echoes the contrast between Bradshaw and Richard Herne Shepherd in the 1860s. Shepherd published in 1866 a little volume entitled Tennysoniana , which may perhaps be regarded as inaugurating the era of what came to be called "author bibliographies"; 28 it presented in a concise listing the information a Tennyson collector was presumed to require, with scarcely any attention given to the details of bookmaking. In the same year Bradshaw prepared a catalogue of the early Cologne books in the Bodleian, noting their typographical characteristics and using collation formulas to record their physical structure. 29 Descriptive bibliography thus became a divided stream: the study of physical details as historical evidence was associated with early books, while simultaneously books by nineteenth-century authors, just then becoming attractive to collectors, were treated in brief checklists aimed at providing the titles to be collected along with the occasional notation of points that supposedly distinguished first from later printings. When Bradshaw in 1870 made his famous statement that the study of physical details in books is like "a branch of natural history," with the output of a press being a genus and each book from that press a species, he noted that the study of "palaeotypography" had previously been "a dilettante matter." 30 A similar contrast could be made between his work and the initial approach to the study of nineteenth-century books, which became the new dilettantism. The contrast was not simply between two levels of sophistication or between the serious and the frivolous but between two basically different approaches to books: on the one hand, the concept of bibliography as history, as a means of uncovering the past through artifactual evidence; on the other, the idea of bibliography as a guide to collecting, with little thought given to the fact that even in this role it could not be effective without thorough historical research. Falconer Madan in 1908 symbolized the depth of this split by his concept of "degressive bibliography," for he was a serious bibliographer of early books who nevertheless believed that later books did not require extensive treatment. 31 This idea has not yet vanished from the scene, but the history of descriptive bibliography is the story of the gradual triumph of the methods that stem from Bradshaw. It would be hard to imagine a more concise statement of the rationale for Bradshaw's approach than the response A. W. Pollard made in 1903 to James Duff Brown's attack on physical bibliography: "so long as literature in order to be communicated has to take material form," Pollard said, "so long will it be to the advantage of the little world which cares for literature that every point which concerns this material form should be carefully and thoroughly investigated." 32 Before the 1920s, however, there was scarcely any more direct challenge to the checklist approach to modern books. Shepherd's several listings were joined in the 1880s by similar lists from F. J. Furnivall, Charles Plumptre Johnson, Beverly Chew, John P. Anderson, and others. 33 In 1886 H. Buxton Forman's The Shelley Library was a step forward 34 and led directly into Thomas J. Wise's long series of bibliographical volumes, running from the Ruskin in 1889-93 to the Byron in 1932-33. Wise was enormously influential in establishing the author bibliography as a special genre of publication; he was a pioneer in examining the structure of nineteenth-century books and providing signature collations for them (which he did after 1901), and his bibliographies helped to publicize the importance of preserving nineteenth-century books in the original publishers' paper and cloth covers rather than in custom-made leather bindings. Like his predecessors in this field, however, he intended his bibliographies to be no more than collectors' guides and indeed used them to glorify his own collections, which he implied should set the standard for others. 35 The beginnings of a different point of view can be seen in E. T. Cook's statement, in his 1912 bibliography of Ruskin, that a bibliography "contains the life-history of an author's work" (p. xx). Another significant step was taken in 1916 in Henrietta C. Bartlett and A. W. Pollard's A Census of Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto, 1594-1709 , which built on the bibliographical analysis in Pollard's epochal Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909) and which recognized the importance of later editions and of examining all surviving copies. 36 And Wise was directly criticized a few years later in Reginald Harvey Griffith's two-volume bibliography of Pope (1922-27), a further demonstration of the necessity in an author bibliography for examining multiple copies of every printing and for providing detailed evidence to support conclusions. 37 Additional important adjustments to the old point of view in the 1920s came from three other bibliographers. Iolo A. Williams, in his Seven XVIIIth Century Bibliographies (1924), noted "typographical peculiarities" even if they occurred in every copy he examined, thus recognizing that bibliographies serve more functions than mere identification. 38 Michael Sadleir's bibliography of Trollope (1928) made clear, by pronouncement and by practice, that the analysis of "book-building" caused bibliographies to be contributions to the history of publishing; the Trollope was, Sadleir said, "not only a reference work for collectors of that particular author but also a commentary on the book and publishing crafts of mid-Victorian England" (p. ix). 39 Frederick A. Pottle's Boswell bibliography, the next year, emphasized the biographical significance of bibliographies, stating that "a thoroughgoing application of the principles of scientific bibliography to the whole of a literary career" is a fruitful way "of coming to understand the character of the author" (p. xviii). These three works are landmarks in the process by which the descriptive bibliography of post-Renaissance authors evolved into a scholarly pursuit. An instructive measure of the slow progress of this evolution is offered by Keynes's famous series of bibliographies, from the Donne in 1914 to the Henry King in 1977. 40 The series invites comparison with Wise's, for both consist of substantial volumes based on the bibliographers' own collections: if Keynes's reflects a general rise of bibliographical standards in its superior scholarship and technique, it does not represent much of an advance in bibliographical thinking, given Keynes's sense of division between scholarship and bibliophily. A better way to view the development of descriptive bibliography in the 1930s and 1940s is to examine several serious bibliographies by other scholars, such as Thomas J. Holmes's series on the Mathers (1931, 1940), Francis R. Johnson's Spenser (1933), Robert E. Spiller and Philip C. Blackburn's Cooper (1934), H. L. Ford's Shakespeare 1700-1740 (1935), William M. Sale's Richardson (1936), Thomas F. Currier's Whittier (1937), Hugh Macdonald's Dryden (1939), Thomas H. Johnson's Jonathan Edwards (1940), J. E. Norton's Gibbon (1940), Anthony J. and Dorothy R. Russo's James Whitcomb Riley (1944), 41 and Allen T. Hazen's three works on Johnson and Walpole ( Samuel Johnson's Prefaces &amp; Dedications [1937], Strawberry Hill Press [with J. P. Kirby, 1942; revised 1973], and Walpole [1948])—all of which exemplify descriptive bibliography as historical scholarship. 42 From the time of Bowers's Principles —1949—onward, advances came at an accelerated pace, if in isolated instances. Beginning in 1951, the series of Soho Bibliographies, despite its unevenness, became an influential and largely beneficial model; 43 and several later series (particularly those published by the University of Pittsburgh Press and the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia) 44 have continued to set high standards. Among the bibliographies (both within those series and independent of them) that can serve to illustrate new directions are Richard L. Purdy's Hardy (1954), with its accounts of composition as well as publication history; 45 Matthew J. Bruccoli's Notes on the Cabell Collections at the University of Virginia (Virginia, 1957) and Warner Barnes's Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1967), with their identifications of printings based on evidence discovered through use of the Hinman Collator; Norma Russell's Cowper (1963) and Edwin T. Bowden's Irving (1989), with their sections of narrative history; William W. Kelly's Ellen Glasgow (Virginia, 1964), with its grouping of printings into plate families; William B. Todd's Burke (Soho, 1964) and Donald D. Eddy's John Brown (1971), with their thorough recording of press figures; D. F. McKenzie's Cambridge University Press 1696-1712 (1966) and William S. Peterson's Kelmscott Press (Soho, 1984), with their extensive use of printers' archives; Joseph Schwartz and Robert C. Schweik's Hart Crane (Pittsburgh, 1972) and George W. Crandell's Ogden Nash (1990), with their attention to later impressions; Alan Tyson's Beethoven (1963) and James L. W. West III's William Styron (1977), with their reports of textual variants; David L. Vander Meulen's Dunciad (Wisconsin dissertation, 1981), with its details on presswork and paper; and David Gilson's Jane Austen (Soho, 1982), with its extensive notes on typography (by Nicolas Barker). Many other effective bibliographies were published during this period, 46 including several that manage to treat extremely large bodies of material with great detail—such as Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939-59), C. William Miller's Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia Printing, 1728-1766 (1974), and Patricia Lockhart Fleming's Upper Canadian Imprints, 1801-1841 (1988). 47 And simultaneously a number of studies of descriptive theory and techniques were appearing to supplement Bowers's Principles , particularly in regard to post-Renaissance books, the concepts of issue and state , and the treatment of paper, type, illustrations, and publishers' bindings. 48 What becomes apparent as one follows this story 49 is the increasing attention to physical details for their own sake, the increasing recognition of the necessity for recording the physical characteristics of artifacts as the first step in reading the past through those artifacts. Books inevitably contain clues from which one can read, in greater or lesser detail, the history of their manufacture and of the relations between the authors and publishers involved in their production. When these details are supplemented by information from printers' and publishers' archives, authors' letters, copyright records, magazine and newspaper advertisements, and other external documents, one begins to see how the study of books as physical objects, as commercial products, illuminates literary history by shedding light on the behavior of authors, publishers, and readers. Bibliographies conceived in this way can serve the function of quick reference, for purposes of identification, more reliably than brief checklists; but they serve many other functions as well and can be read with profit by anyone interested in biography or intellectual history. 50 This understanding of descriptive bibliography as history, as a genre of historical writing, implies certain requirements for bibliographical procedure. It entails, first of all, the examination of multiple copies of every impression of a printed book (from any period), for every copy is a separate artifact and thus a separate—and unique—source of evidence. If one's object is to describe an edition as a whole, not simply a single copy, the only basis for such generalizations is a knowledge of the individual items that make up the edition—ideally every surviving copy, but at least, in instances where the survival of a large number of copies makes that goal unrealistic, an extensive sampling. And later editions are just as deserving of such treatment as are the firsts, for they have their place in publishing and textual history. 51 Furthermore, the characteristics to be described are the ones that existed at the time the books were released for sale; any features (a binding, perhaps, or the absence of certain leaves) that date from a later time are part of a different story, the post-publication history of individual copies rather than the history of the production and publication of the entire edition. 52 Descriptive bibliographers thus do not simply record the details of extant objects; rather, like other historians, they interpret the evidence in surviving materials for the purpose of reconstructing the past. It follows that conclusions drawn from the analysis of physical evidence ("analytical bibliography") are essential to descriptive bibliography—and that textual variants, being physical differences between copies of an edition or between editions, are a part of the body of evidence to be considered. Information located in external documents forms an important part of a thorough account, but its status as secondary evidence—as far as the books themselves are concerned-must be kept clearly in mind. These ideas, which are the outgrowth of a hundred and fifty years of bibliographical thinking, constitute a sound basis for responsible work in book history. Yet they are still resisted by some people. Nothing better illustrates the persistence of the split that has characterized descriptive bibliography throughout its history than the continuing reluctance, on the part of some prominent bibliographers, to regard descriptive bibliographies as anything more than collectors' guides to the classification of copies of books. 53 A generation after Keynes's address, for instance, another president of another bibliographical society took up the same theme. Herman W. Liebert, speaking before the Bibliographical Society of America, issued "a plea for the re-direction of the course of bibliography away from its prevailing tendencies and back toward an older kind" (p. 10). 54 In his view the presence of Greek letters in collation formulas reflects a desire for mystification, and the use of collating machines and gutter measurements leads to "atrophy of the judgment" (p. 18). 55 It cannot be denied that some people—in all fields, not just bibliography—feed their self-importance by using arcane terminology and inflicting masses of undigested detail on the public. Liebert is right to deplore such behavior, but it is sad to see him regarding precision and elaboration as signs in themselves of self-aggrandizement or an abdication of the responsibility for making critical judgments. 56 The reason to employ collation formulas is that in many instances they are clearer and more easily usable than long paragraphs in words would be; describing in some fashion the structure of the gatherings is essential, and when formulas can help, it is foolish to be put off by their quasi-mathematical appearance. As for lists of such details as shifting or damaged types, they must—like all details in good writing—be integrated into the description as a whole; but their mere presence is not cause for alarm, since there can be no a priori dividing line between appropriate and inappropriate levels of detail. For Liebert, extensive detail can drive "all the fun . . . out of the enterprise" (p. 14). But surely there is more fun, more satisfaction, for bibliographer and collector alike, in subjugating a greater multiplicity, in accommodating and ordering a larger portion of the welter of complexities that inhere in every situation. 57 Willfully ignoring the articulation of such detail trivializes bibliographical research and makes it unfit to serve even the modest function that Liebert sees for it—as when he says that the "true bibliographer . . . works for the people (librarians, collectors, book-dealers) who seek to assemble the materials for scholars of many sorts" (p. 23). 58 To him, the study of books as physical objects is "a valuable adjunct to literary and historical research" (p. 19)—"valuable," to be sure, but an "adjunct" nevertheless. His failure to recognize that bibliography is historical research and that book collecting is scholarship undercuts his wish to promote the useful roles and the pleasures of both activities. 59 The most poignant defect of the line of thinking that includes Keynes and Liebert as its major exponents is the tendency to regard the detailed study and description of physical objects as unhumanistic—as a technical specialty far removed from, if not inimical to, the love of literature. A classic statement of the position is Liebert's: "The book as physical object is consequential to the humanist for what it contains. . . . and the recitation of the facts of its production, when they reveal nothing about its contents, belongs to the history of technology" (p. 19). It is true that the majority of books are utilitarian containers; but since what they contain is the evidence through which we can approach verbal or musical or choreographic works, and not the works themselves, there can be no details of their production that are irrelevant to evaluating that evidence and thus to reconstructing and experiencing those works. The history of technology is inseparable from the history of the arts, all of which are transmitted either directly or indirectly by manufactured objects—objects, that is, made by human hands. I would therefore rewrite Liebert's sentence as follows: "The book as physical object is consequential to the humanist because it was made by human beings." 60 All artifacts are important as the principal class of evidence for reconstructing what human beings were doing and thinking in the past. Descriptive bibliography is a quintessential humanistic discipline because it rests on that irreducible fact. It begins—where we all must begin if we wish to approach the past—with the objects that have come down to us. Traditionally descriptive bibliographies have focused on one category of objects, those that carry symbolic renderings of intangible media like language, musical sounds, and dance movements. Thus they recount the lives of writers, composers, choreographers, printers, and publishers from the perspective of the documents that constitute the tangible residue of their achievements. 61 In the process, bibliographers evaluate those documents by every means available, internal and external, and thereby instruct their readers in how to read, in how to go about recreating—as each reader must—the intangible works represented by the texts of the documents. And by so doing, bibliography provides a model for other endeavors, since nearly all historical accounts, whether organized according to individual lives or other groupings of events, are exercises in assessing physical evidence. 62 Sometimes oral tradition is available, but more often we have to use—or decide it is preferable to use—tangible evidence, found in such objects as books and computer disks, statues and urns. We live in a network of artifacts, which significantly affect our existence, our approach to the present as well as to the past. As Nancy Hale said of the objects in her mother's studio, they "seem worlds in themselves," each one "speaking of a real time, a real place." 63 The reality that we create from artifacts can be a view of the past, or it can be a view of the present. We each form our present this way, at least part of the time, simply from being surrounded by artifacts; but some of us also wish to try to glimpse the human past through the fragments of it that remain, and as a result to see into the present from a new perspective. No one knows better than descriptive bibliographers the power of objects to suggest the past; and no one is more aware of the evanescence of things, of the destructiveness of time, than bibliographers who confront cracked and faded bindings, torn and stained leaves, or incomplete and disheveled copies of once-splendid books. Yet through such relics we build up our visions of the past; and the recorded details of those relics—however manifold, however minute, however technical—contribute to the richness and comprehensiveness of our conception of the lives and ideas that have preceded our own. If we are interested in the human past, and the role it plays in the present, descriptive bibliography tells a story that we have to understand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper was delivered as an Engelhard Lecture on the Book at the Library of Congress on 13 September 1991. 1 The story originally appeared in the March 1923 number (55: 269-281) of Pearson's Magazine (London) and was first collected in The Puzzle Lock (London, 1925; New York, 1926) and then reprinted in The Famous Cases of Dr. Thorndyke (1929), pp. 818-852. The latter text is cited here. (The periodical text contains slightly less physical description—with no reference, for instance, to "wire-lines" and "water-mark"—but it does include the explanation of dating paper from the presence of esparto. I am grateful to Richard Colles Johnson for calling my attention to this story.) 2 The original edition (1934) of An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets was reprinted in 1983 with corrections and an epilogue by Nicolas Barker and John Collins, who also published at the same time a companion volume, A Sequel to "An Enquiry." 3 "Detective Fiction," in New Paths in Book Collecting , ed. Carter (1934), pp. 33-63 (see p. 46); the essay was separately published the same year, under the title Collecting Detective Fiction (but with the original pagination), in Constable's "Aspects of Book-Collecting" series. 4 Verbal texts can be conveyed by other physical vehicles, of course, such as clay tablets, microfiche, and computer disks. The precise form that a physical description takes is obviously determined by the particular characteristics of the physical objects being described. Whether one uses the term "descriptive bibliography" to encompass the physical description of all objects carrying verbal, musical, and choreographic texts—or only those in codex and broadside form—is far less significant than whether one recognizes the importance of describing all such objects, since all physical forms have an effect on the texts they convey. I focus here on descriptive bibliographies of books in codex and broadside form because I am describing the field of descriptive bibliography as it has developed, not because there is any reason that descriptive bibliographies should not take up other vehicles of textual transmission as well. 5 "History," in Essays &amp; Lectures (Library of America, 1983), p. 241. 6 Anthropologists, folklorists, art historians, and others who have developed the field of "material culture" have generally not included books in their conception of artifacts or used physical evidence from books. This point is illustrated by Jules David Prown's "Mind in Matter: An Introduction to Material Culture Theory and Method." Winterthur Portfolio , 17 (1982), 1-19, which provides an overview of the field. An example of a writer who does see books in terms of other artifacts is F. N. L. Poynter, who in his Howell and Zeitlin &amp; VerBrugge Lecture, Bibliography: Some Achievements &amp; Prospects (1961), speaks of our "passion for preserving every record and relic of man's past, whether it be an old book or manuscript, a prehistoric stone implement, a Nubian temple, or an 18th century house which is threatened with demolition"; he says, "Historical research involves the critical investigation of original sources of knowledge, that is, the books, documents, and manuscripts and all the physical remains of the past which have survived to our own time" (p. 18). (On the difference between, on the one hand, verbal, musical, and choreographic texts in books and, on the other, visual works [or reproductions of such works] in books, see note 11 below.) 7 This strip, drawn by Jerry Scott (succeeding Ernie Bushmiller), was syndicated by United Features Syndicate on 22 March 1986. (I am grateful to Harrison Hayford for calling it to my attention.) The same theme also recently appeared in a New Yorker drawing by Benoît van Innis (18 March 1991, p. 39): the caption reads, "The author was most informative about his latest novel," and the drawing shows a man pointing out to two other men the details of a diagram of a book, with the cover labeled "red" and the measurements of the height, width, and thickness indicated. 8 Although some scholars studying the social history of books have recognized the role that physical evidence must play in their work, others have regarded the detailed analysis of such evidence as merely a narrow (and even unproductive) specialty. One of the most effective concise replies to this view appears in David L. Vander Meulen's Engelhard Lecture, Where Angels Fear to Tread: Descriptive Bibliography and Alexander Pope (1988): the position, he says, "ultimately is at variance with inductive logic itself, rejecting the evidence required for sound generalizations. Among bibliographers a steady source of bemusement is the scholars who think mysteries would be solved and careers established by the discovery of a document about the publication of a book but who meanwhile reject available evidence by ignoring the even greater insights that copies of the book themselves provide" (p. 10). The seminal book in the field of l'histoire du livre is Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin's L'Apparition du livre (1958), translated into English by David Gerard as The Coming of the Book (1976). For an introduction to some of the issues raised by this development and for further references, see John Feather, "Cross-Channel Currents: Historical Bibliography and l'histoire du livre," Library , 6th ser., 2 (1980), 1-15; my Hanes Lecture, The History of Books as a Field of Study (1981); and the collection of papers entitled Books and Society in History , ed. Kenneth Carpenter (1983). 9 For further discussion of this point, see my Malkin Lecture, Libraries, Museums, and Reading (1991), and "Reproductions and Scholarship," Studies in Bibliography [ SB ], 42 (1989), 25-54. In a review of Joel Myerson's bibliography of Emerson (1982), Albert J. von Frank discusses what he sees as "two audiences of text-centered and book-centered interests" and asserts that "bibliographical theory has developed in the direction of satisfying students of the book or, rather, students of the history of the book" instead of students of texts. Unquestionably many bibliographers have slighted textual matters, but "bibliographical theory" is surely not responsible, since the main direction of twentieth-century bibliographical theory is a growing recognition of the interconnections between physical evidence and verbal works. It is not incorrect to claim that in general there have been "two distinct audiences" for bibliographies in the past, but to say that they have "largely unreconcilable expectations" (as opposed to "unreconciled" expectations) is to suggest that the two interests are conceptually or theoretically separate—and thus to perpetuate an old confusion. See "Emerson Bibliography: History and Audience," Review , 9 (1987), 189-203 (esp. pp. 202-203). 10 That is, accuracy according to whatever standard is selected. "Accuracy" of texts has traditionally meant conformity to authors' intentions (though precisely how authorial intentions are to be defined has never been agreed upon); but in recent years considerable attention has been devoted to texts as social products that emerge from the collaborative process of publication and thus embody the intentions of a number of persons. For a survey of such issues, see my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," SB , 44 (1991), 83-143. 11 For further exposition of these ideas, see my Rosenbach Lectures, A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989), and Libraries, Museums, and Reading (see note 9 above). I emphasize, here and below, the process of reading the physical texts of certain works in intangible media (those media that can feasibly be represented by notation in books), because the relevance of the physical form in which such texts are conveyed is not widely understood. Visual material may of course also form part (or all) of the "content" of books, but naturally there is little misunderstanding of the necessity for studying original prints as physical objects, whether or not they are housed in books. There may, however, be some misunderstanding about the status of reproductions of works of painting, sculpture, and architecture in books: in the first place, they may be accepted as original works of visual art in their own right and are then no different from other original prints; but if they are approached as reproductions, they resemble the printed and handwritten texts of verbal, musical, and choreographic works in that they are not the works themselves, but they differ from the physical representations of intangible works in that they are simply reminders of works that can be located in physical form elsewhere, not essential pieces of evidence for the act of approaching and experiencing those works. (Visual art, of whatever kind, appearing in books must obviously be accounted for in bibliographical descriptions; see my "The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books," SB , 35 [1982], 1-42.) 12 See Maittaire's Annales typographici (1719-41); Ames's Typographical Antiquities (1749; augmented by William Herbert, 1785-90); and Panzer's Annales typographici (1793-1803). 13 Essay on the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion (1715). See Strickland Gibson, "Thomas Bennet, a Forgotten Bibliographer," Library , 5th ser., 6 (1951), 43-47; William A. Jackson, Bibliography &amp; Literary Studies (1962), pp. 5-6 (reprinted in Records of a Bibliographer , ed. William H. Bond [1967], pp. 211-222 [see pp. 214-215]); and William L. Williamson, "Thomas Bennet and the Origins of Analytical Bibliography," Journal of Library History , 16 (1981), 177-186. 14 David Foxon, in his Howell and Zeitlin &amp; VerBrugge Lecture, Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), traces the use of title-page transcription to Capell's Prolusions (1760 [1759]) and believes that the practice was "born of his typographical ingenuity, probably reinforced by an antiquarian interest in the appearance of the original title-pages" (p. 13). See also note 53 below. 15 Thomas Hartwell Horne, writing in the ear of bibliomania following the Roxburghe sale of 1812 (the era chronicled voluminously by Thomas Frognall Dibdin from 1809 to 1838), implied these connections, however indistinctly, by treating as part of "bibliography" both the subject classification of works and the examination of the physical structure of books; in An Introduction to the Study of Bibliography (1814), he explains how sheets are folded to produce different formats and how chainlines in the paper can assist in identifying format, and he says that a "knowledge of the forms of books" helps "to prevent confusion in describing editions" (p. 288). In the autumn of 1852 Augustus De Morgan wrote a piece entitled "On the Difficulty of Correct Description of Books" for the Companion to the Almanac for 1853 (pp. 5-19); although by "description" he did not primarily mean physical description, he did discuss some of the problems (such as incorrect dating) that require attention to physical details. It is significant (given the activities of bibliographical societies and clubs at the turn of the century [see note 17 below]) that De Morgan's essay was reprinted three times in 1902: as a pamphlet by the Bibliographical Society of Chicago, with notes by Aksel G. S. Josephson; in the June 1902 number of the Library Association Record (4: 247-273), with an introduction by Henry Guppy; and as a pamphlet (reprinting the latter) by the Bibliographical Society of Lancashire. For some commentary on the historical importance of De Morgan's essay and on his other work, see A. N. L. Munby's Howell and Zeitlin &amp; VerBrugge Lecture, The History and Bibliography of Science in England: The First Phase, 1833-1845 (1968), pp. 9-13; Munby quotes De Morgan in 1847 as saying, "The most worthless book of a bygone day is a record worthy of preservation." 16 The best account of Bradshaw's bibliographical achievement is Paul Needham's Hanes Lecture, The Bradshaw Method (1988), which contains an appendix on "Henry Bradshaw and the Development of the Collational Formula" (pp. 24-33), tracing Bradshaw's formula (in the form "abcdefgh8/2;") back at least to April 1861. (Cf. note 29 below.) The other basic works for a study of Bradshaw are George W. Prothero's A Memoir of Henry Bradshaw (1888) and the two collections of Bradshaw's writings— Collected Papers , ed. Francis Jenkinson (1889), and Henry Bradshaw, 1831-1886 , ed. Roy Stokes (1984). Stokes provides lists of Bradshaw's writings and of writings about him, including the several publications of his letters (see also Needham's first footnote for a concise overview of this material). Some unpublished letters of Bradshaw, particularly those addressed to William Blades beginning in 1859, show the early development of his ideas, as Needham has pointed out (pp. 14-17); Blades's role in this correspondence and his published work in The Life and Typography of William Caxton (1861-63), praised by Bradshaw, make Blades another formative influence on the early development of analytical and descriptive bibliography. 17 See the first volume of Madan's Oxford Books , entitled The Early Oxford Press (1895 [the early pages were printed in 1889]; cf. his "On Method in Bibliography," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 1 [1892-93], 91-102); Copinger's "Incunabula Virgiliana," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 2 (1893-94), 123-226; and Proctor's An Index to the Early Printed Books in the British Museum, with Notes of Those in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (1898). Systematic attention is given to collation by gatherings (and the examination of other physical features) in M. A. Einsle's chapter, "The Art of Describing and Cataloguing Incunabula, and the Method of Collecting Them," in Henri Bouchot, The Book: Its Printers, Illustrators, and Binders , ed. H. Grevell (1890), pp. 322-365 (though there is no suggestion here of a formula for recording signature collation, other than to say that "deviations from the usual system of signing must be expressly specified" [p. 335]). Cf. John P. Edmond, "Suggestions for the Description of Books Printed between 1501 and 1640," Library Association Record , 3 (1901), 133-142. Collation reports in the form "A-K, in fours" appear in several early Grolier Club publications, such as Catalogue of Original and Early Editions of Some of the Poetical and Prose Works of English Writers from Langland to Wither (1893) and Catalogue of an Exhibition of First and Other Editions of the Works of John Dryden (1900), as well as in Victor H. Paltsits's 1903 bibliography of Freneau. In 1899 John Ferguson listed "the signatures" and "the collation" among the features that are "now included in book description" (see p. 10 of "Some Aspects of Bibliography," Publications of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , 4 [1899-1900], 1-102; published separately in 1900); significantly, he also stated, "Just, then, as biography follows from the existence of human beings, bibliography is the result of the existence of printed books. Bibliography is, in fact, the biography of books" (p. 9). 18 An admirable survey of the accomplishments of that half-century is F. P. Wilson's "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography,'" in The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942: Studies in Retrospect (1945), pp. 76-135; a revised edition of it, edited by Helen Gardner, appeared as a separate volume in 1970. For a briefer treatment of a longer period, see pp. 61-68 of my "Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century," in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine: Essays on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Osler Library , ed. Philip M. Teigen (1982), pp. 55-79; and for references to writings about the prominent figures in this movement, see my "Bibliographical History as a Field of Study," SB , 41 (1988), 33-63. 19 I have attempted to demonstrate how analytical bibliography contributes to printing history in "Analytical Bibliography and Renaissance Printing History," Printing History , 3.1 (1981), 24-33, and to assess the controversies over the validity of analytical endeavor in "Bibliography and Science," SB , 27 (1974), 55-89 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 1-35). The best introductions to analytical bibliography, which are also landmarks in bibliographical history, are Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963) and Fredson Bowers's Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). For references to some prominent illustrations of the relevance of physical descriptions to cultural and intellectual history, see my Libraries, Museums, and Reading (see note 9 above), note 13. (See also Vander Meulen's comment quoted in note 8 above.) Roy Stokes's summary accounts of descriptive bibliography emphasize the underlying role of analytical bibliography: in The Function of Bibliography (1969), he says, "No description of any value can possibly be produced until the critical analysis of the book has been completed" (p. 96, in the chapter on "Descriptive Bibliography," pp. 96-117); and in "Descriptive Bibliography: Its Definition and Function," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 18 (1979), 19-25, he says, "Descriptive work is fundamentally the recording in accurate, convenient, and understandable form of the results of analysis" (p. 19). Adrian Weiss, who has developed an important concept of font analysis that can contribute to the identification of Elizabethan and Jacobean printers, sees such analytical work explicitly as part of descriptive bibliography, as well as of editing: see, for example, his "Bibliographical Methods for Identifying Unknown Printers in Elizabethan/Jacobean Books," SB , 44 (1991), 183-228 (esp. pp. 183-187). Evidence concerning the identity of printers, he says, is "an essential component of a bibliographical description" (p. 185)—because "The purpose of descriptive bibliography is to record two kinds of information about a book: its physical characteristics and corresponding inferences about its printing history; and other details which may contribute to the general understanding of early printing" (p. 184). 20 Pollard and Greg, "Some Points in Bibliographical Descriptions," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-8), 31-52 (reprinted in Alfred William Pollard: A Selection of His Essays , ed.

Greg's statement, a few years earlier, that bibliography involves "the complete investigation of the material construction of the books enumerated and the whole history of their production"—that is, the "life-history of books" ("Bibliography—A Retrospect," in The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942 [see note 18 above], pp. 23-31 [quotation from p. 27]). (Cf. Ferguson's 1899 statement in note 17 above.) 22 For a splendid analytical account of the reception of Bowers's Principles , see David L. Vander Meulen, "The History and Future of Bowers's Principles ," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [ PBSA ], 79 (1985), 197-219 (reprinted in Fredson Bowers at Eighty [1985], pp. 25-47). In the same gathering of essays, I offered my evaluation of Bowers's contribution to descriptive bibliography: see "The Achievement of Fredson Bowers," esp. pp. 181-184 (reprint, pp. 9-12). Another book of 1949 dealt with the same subject as Bowers's under the title Standards of Bibliographical Description and consisted of three Rosenbach Lectures delivered in 1947 by Curt F. Bühler, James G. McManaway, and Lawrence C. Wroth, who had exchanged ideas with Bowers and whose recommendations are not always in line with his; their lectures, as Vander Meulen points out, include responses to Bowers before the publication of Principles , and Bowers's book, in turn, responds to their lectures. Also in 1949 appeared a second printing of J. D. Cowley's Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing , originally published in 1939; intended for library-school students, it contained the most extensive summary of descriptive practices before Bowers. 23 "Religio Bibliographici" was first published in the Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 63-76; it was reprinted as the introduction to the catalogue of Keynes's library, Bibliotheca Bibliographici (1964), pp. ix-xxiii, and then as an appendix to his autobiography, The Gates of Memory (1981), pp. 373-391 (the text cited here). In the autobiography Keynes comments briefly on his approach to bibliography (pp. 308-310) and describes the meeting at which he delivered this "friendly attack on the Bowers school of analytical bibliographers" (asking for "less pedantry and more humanity"): "It chanced that Professor Bowers was present at the occasion. I was glad that he accepted the address in the spirit in which it was meant, complaining only that he had not thought of the title himself" (p. 309). Six years later Bowers referred to the attitude reflected in this address as "the very reverse of scholarly" ( The Bibliographical Way [1959]; reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [1975], pp. 54-74 [see p. 66]). This exchange was no doubt in F. N. L. Poynter's mind in 1961 when he offered his own views regarding the "mixed feelings with which his [Bowers's] work was received" (see Bibliography: Some Achievements &amp; Prospects [see note 6 above], pp. 9-11. In 1971 Frank Francis quoted a long passage from "Religio Bibliographici" as part of an account of the split in bibliography between "uncompromising" scholars and "amateurs" or "dilettanti"; see "A Bibliographical Ghost Revisits His Old Haunts," Library Chronicle of the University of Texas , n.s., 3 (1971), 29-44 (the second Lew David Feldman Lecture, reprinted separately in 1972 [see pp. 13-14]). 24 Bowers took note of this kind of sentiment when, in "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography and Literary Studies" ( PBSA , 46 [1952], 186-208; reprinted in his collected essays [see the preceding note], pp. 37-53), he recognized "the frankly admitted nostalgia for the good old days before the tabby cat of bibliography grew into a tiger" (p. 39). Keynes replied, "I wish to maintain that even a 'tyger, tyger, burning bright' in the bibliographical forests is not the only beacon that beckons the contemporary bibliographer. The old tabby cat, innocent of streamlined brilliance, can still be well worth stroking by our firesides" (pp. 384-385). Bowers's cat metaphor also underlies Paul S. Dunkin's Bibliography: Tiger or Fat Cat? (1975), which continues Dunkin's criticisms of Bowers begun in his How to Catalog a Rare Book (1951; rev. ed., 1973); my own examination of Dunkin's position appears on pp. 39-41 of "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing," SB , 30 (1977), 1-56 (reprinted in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 37-92 [see pp. 75-77]). The latest reference to the cat metaphor occurs in Nicolas Barker's obituary of Bowers ( The Independent , 15 April 1991): describing Bowers's view of the former lack of rigor in his field, Barker says, "Bibliography was a domestic cat, purring by the library fireside, when it should be a tiger, stalking its prey, the vera lectio , in the jungle of printed texts." 25 He believed that, as a result of Bowers's book, "the rest of us are inclined to feel that we have been chastised with scorpions because we are not all Gregs or even imitation Gregs" (p. 375). Bowers did not, of course, mean to imply that there is "no place for the humbler bibliographical practitioner dealing with problems of less transcendent importance"; rather, he was saying that, whatever the subject matter ("transcendent" or not), it should be addressed with the greatest rigor attainable. Keynes failed to recognize that aiming to be anything less than an "imitation Greg" is not to do justice to the field or to one's potentiality as a human being. It is therefore hard to know how to take his statement at the end that "there is a place for more than one kind of bibliographer" and that "Each kind must maintain the highest standards of his craft" (p. 391)—for his earlier distinction between different kinds of bibliographers was based on different standards, different degrees of approach to what he calls "pure scholarship." 26 They behave in this fashion, he says, because they find themselves "in the company of scholars, who need to be convinced that bibliography really has serious claims on their attention," and therefore "they instinctively react by behaving as a small persecuted minority" (p. 377). There are people in all fields who for such reasons overstate the significance of their own work; but they are not the best representatives of their fields, and their presence should not stand in the way of an objective assessment of the scholarly method required in those fields. 27 The superficiality of his view of artifacts is indicated by his assertion that "Stamp collecting is an amusing game, but it is essentially sterile" (p. 386). 28 These lists focused on contemporary or near-contemporary authors. A few similar listings, dealing with authors of earlier centuries, had previously been published—e.g., John Wilson's Shaksperiana (1827), which includes (pp. 41-69) a list of the quartos and collected editions of Shakespeare's plays. As early as 1880, some criticism of previous lists was implied by Ralph Thomas (writing as "Olphar Hamst") in Aggravating Ladies: A List of Works Published under the Pseudonym of "A Lady," with Preliminary Suggestions on the Art of Describing Books Bibliographically ; he objects, for instance, to any abbreviation of title-page wording (p. 20) and complains about the confusion between format terms and size (pp. 24-25). 29 See his "Memorandum No. 1," The Printer of the Historia S. Albani (1868)—reprinted in his Collected Papers (see note 16 above), pp. 149-163, and in Stokes (see note 16 above), pp. 106-126—where he states (p. 152 or p. 109) that "the descriptions here given, so far as they relate to books preserved at Oxford, are only portions of a similar catalogue, which I made in 1866, of about 100 quarto books, all printed (apparently) at Cologne, before the introduction of printed signatures, and all preserved in the Auctarium of the Bodleian Library." He gives a description of his style of collation report (pp. 150-151 or p. 108), which here takes the now-standard form—e.g., "a b c 8 d 6 " (p. 156 or p. 114). At about the same time, William Frederick Poole was using typographical evidence (running titles and signatures) in preparing his edition (1867) of Edward Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence ; see William Landram Williamson, "An Early Use of Running Title and Signature Evidence in Analytical Bibliography," Library Quarterly , 40 (1970), 245-249. 30 See his "Memorandum No. 2," A Classified Index of the Fifteenth Century Books in the Collection of M. J. De Meyer, Which Were Sold at Ghent in November, 1869 (1870), reprinted in his Collected Papers (see note 16 above), pp. 206-236 (quotations from p. 221). The key passage, one of the landmarks of bibliographical writing, is worth quoting in full: "The method of arranging these early books under the countries, towns and presses at which they were produced is the only one which can really advance our knowledge of the subject. This is comparatively easy with dated books, though there is no safeguard against the misleading nature of an erroneous date. But the study is of little use unless the bibliographer will be content to make such an accurate and methodical study of the types used and habits of printing observable at different presses, as to enable him to observe and be guided by these characteristics in setting the date of a book which bears no date on the surface. We do not want the opinion or dictum of any bibliographer however experienced; we desire that the types and habits of each printer should be made a special subject of study, and those points brought forward which shew changes or advance from year to year, or, where practicable, from month to month. When this is done, we have to say of any dateless or falsely dated book that it contains such and such characteristics, and we therefore place it at such a point of time, the time we name being merely another expression for the characteristics we notice in the book. In fact each press must be looked upon as a genus , and each book as a species , and our business is to trace the more or less close connexion of the different members of the family according to the characters which they present to our observation. The study of palaeotypography has been hitherto mainly such a dilettante matter, that people have shrunk from going into such details, though when once studied as a branch of natural history, it is as fruitful in interesting results as most subjects" (p. 221). 31 "Degressive Bibliography," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-8), 53-65. The term "degressive bibliography" has become widely used, in a broader sense than the one intended by Madan, to mean the practice of varying the amount of detail in entries treating different categories of books. An instructive exchange of letters on the subject appeared in the Times Literary Supplement on 4 and 11 August and 1 and 22 September 1966, pp. 716, 732, 781, 884; the most thorough discussion of it occurs in Fredson Bowers's "Bibliography Revisited," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 89-128 (reprinted in his collected essays [see note 23 above], pp. 151-195), which points out that abbreviation of reported detail should not imply abbreviation of research. Cf. my "The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies," SB , 37 (1984), 1-38 (esp. pp. 25-28); and "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), 1-12. 32 See "Practical Bibliography," Library , 2nd ser., 4 (1903), 144-151 (Brown), 151-162 (Pollard; quotation from p. 161); reprinted in Roper (see note 20 above), pp. 86-97. Brown's aggressive polemic is yet another indication of how strong the resistance has been to the study of physical evidence: "It is a remarkable thing that bibliographers . . . should spend all their time squabbling about type-founts and the merely material side of books. . . . The value of detailed registration of pages, signatures, watermarks, sizes by paper-folds or centimetres, blank leaves, and all the other etceteras of exact collation, never struck me as being more than a dreadful waste of time, save as regards very old books. . . . but to see bibliographers seriously quoting such scraps of the obvious, in the case of comparatively modern books, regularly paged and easily identified, is really a solemn sham. It is an endeavour to provide with a series of formidable looking symbols a simple art which would be ever so much more rational if stripped of all this pseudo-scientific garnishing" (pp. 145, 149-150). Pollard's witty and effective reply affirms (in response to Brown's agitation over the description of blank leaves) the importance of knowing book structure in all instances ("I must confess myself to a preference for being told whether even a modern book which begins on the third leaf of a sheet has lost a half-title and a portrait, or only two pieces of white paper" [p. 155]), and it explains briefly why "the historian of literature and the critical editor must rely greatly on the help of bibliographers if they are to do justice to their subjects, and avoid serious errors" (p. 160). Brown repeated his attack on the "almost painful accuracy and exhaustiveness" of the "'natural history' method" in A Manual of Practical Bibliography (1906), pp. 61-63: "If any of the items set out with so much care were variable, one could appreciate the value of so much patient industry, but as the same editions of a book never vary from one another, save in regard to imperfections or misplaced sheets or leaves, it must be confessed that most of the descriptive collation in cases like this is a sheer waste of time, money, and space." 33 By the early 1880s, Shepherd had treated Tennyson (1866), Ruskin (1878), Dickens (1880), Thackeray (1880), Carlyle (1881), and Swinburne (1883). Among the other lists of the eighties were Furnivall's of Browning (1881-84), Johnson's of Thackeray and Dickens (both 1885), Chew's of Longfellow (1885), and Anderson's appended to biographies of Rossetti, Dickens, and the Brontës (all 1887), of Scott (1888), and of Byron and George Eliot (both 1890). The best examinations of the early "author bibliographies" (showing their relation to collecting trends) are provided by Michael Sadleir's "The Development during the Last Fifty Years of Bibliographical Study of Books of the XIXth Century," in The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942 (see note 18 above), pp. 146-158 (which includes a list of such works from 1868 to 1914 [pp. 148-149]), and by John Carter's Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting (1948), esp. Chapters 2 and 3. (Ferguson [see note 17 above] also gives a list of early author bibliographies on pp. 91-95.) Here and later, I normally cite author (or press) bibliographies simply by the name of the bibliographer, the name of the author (or press) treated, and the year; full citations of many of these bibliographies (often with references to reviews) can be found in the lists of British and American author bibliographies in (respectively) T. H. Howard-Hill's Bibliography of British Literary Bibliographies (1969; supplemented by his Shakespearian Bibliography and Textual Criticism , 1971) and my Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (1971). 34 On Forman, see Nicolas Barker and John Collins, A Sequel to "An Enquiry" (1983), pp. 23-42 (esp. pp. 30 and 33 for the Shelley bibliography). 35 Wise's bibliographical volumes fall into two sequences, the bibliographies (all but one published by 1920) and the descriptive catalogues of his author collections (published mainly in the 1920s): the succession of bibliographies dealt with Ruskin (substantially the work of James P. Smart, 1889-93), Robert Browning (1897), Tennyson (1908), Coleridge (1913; supplemented 1919), Borrow (1914), Wordsworth (1916), the Brontës (1917), Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1918), Landor (1919), Swinburne (1919-20), Conrad (1920; revised 1921), and Byron (1932-33); the catalogues (primarily reprinted, with revisions, from The Ashley Library [11 vols., 1922-36]) covered Shelley (1924), Swinburne (1925), Two Lake Poets (1927, dealing with Wordsworth and Coleridge), Byron (1928), Conrad (1928), Landor (1928), the Brontës (1929), the Brownings (1929), Dryden (1930), and Pope (1931). Simon Nowell-Smith has assessed Wise's achievement in descriptive bibliography in "T. J. Wise as Bibliographer," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 129-141; see also Michael Sadleir's perceptive comments in his essay for the Bibliographical Society's jubilee volume (see note 18 above), pp. 151-152, 155-156, and John Carter's Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting (1948), pp. 15-16 (noting that Wise lacked "a disinterested wish to arrive at the truth"). 36 The entry for every edition gives a signature collation, the measurement of the type-page, and the catchwords of the first page of each quire, as well as the physical characteristics of each copy. The relation of this detail to textual study is taken for granted in the substantial introduction (which is omitted in the 1939 edition expanded and revised by Bartlett). See also Bartlett's Mr. William Shakespeare of 1922. 37 Some discussion of the dispute between Wise and Griffith appears in my "The Descriptive Bibliography of Eighteenth-Century Books," in Eighteenth-Century English Books Considered by Librarians and Booksellers, Bibliographers and Collectors (1976), pp. 22-33 (see pp. 24-26); and in Vander Meulen's Where Angels Fear to Tread (see note 8 above), pp. 6-7, 11-12, 18, 21. 38 Ten years later Williams published another important bibliographical work, Points in Eighteenth-Century Verse (in Michael Sadleir's "Bibliographia" series, which carried the significant subtitle "Studies in Book History and Book Structure"); in an introductory essay, he said, "I have tried to state each case, as known to me, fully, and to give the reader every facility for coming to an opposite conclusion to my own if he considers my reasoning faulty" (p. 35). 39 Sadleir later reinforced these views about the place of publishing history in bibliography: see "The Development during the Last Fifty Years of Bibliographical Study of Books of the XIXth Century," in The Bibliographical Society, 1892-1942 (see note 18 above), pp. 146-158. The importance of Sadleir and his circle in the history of bibliography is suggested by Dan H. Laurence's reference to him as "that annunciatory angel Michael Sadleir" in his Engelhard Lecture, A Portrait of the Author as a Bibliography (1983), p. 12. 40 Keynes treated Donne (1914; revised 1932, 1958, 1973), Blake (1921), Thomas Browne (1924; revised 1968), William Harvey (1928; revised 1953), Jane Austen (1929), Hazlitt (1931; revised 1981), John Evelyn (1937; revised 1968), John Ray (1951), Rupert Brooke (1954; revised 1959, 1964), Robert Hooke (1960), Timothie Bright (1962), Siegfried Sassoon (1962), William Petty and John Graunt (1971), George Berkeley (1976), and Henry King (1977). Keynes also published a bibliography of George Cumberland in the Book Collector , 19 (1970), 31-65. 41 And the other three volumes in the Indiana Historical Society series, Dorothy R. Russo's George Ade (1947) and Dorothy R. Russo and Thelma L. Sullivan's Booth Tarkington (1949) and Bibliographical Studies of Seven Authors of Crawfordsville, Indiana (1952). These bibliographies, produced under the patronage of Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., reflect advice from Jacob Blanck (whose other projects for Lilly include a bibliography of Harry Castlemon [1941] and the Bibliography of American Literature [1955- ]). Blanck's belief in the importance of publishing history in bibliography is expressed in The Title-Page as Bibliographical Evidence (1966). See also pp. 16-17 of my "The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors," SB , 21 (1968), 1-24. 42 John Carter, writing in 1948, declared that during the seventy-five-year development of author bibliography "perhaps a score of really first-class performances have been achieved" ( Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting , p. 107). 43 The Soho series, published originally by Rupert Hart-Davis and later (as of 1976) by Oxford University Press (with revisions of earlier titles sometimes published elsewhere), was initially supervised by an editorial board consisting of John Carter, John Hayward, W. A. Jackson, and A. N. L. Munby. The series contains Allan Wade's Yeats (1951; revised 1958, 1968), John Carter and John Sparrow's Housman (1952; revised 1982 by William White), A. E. Gallatin and L. M. Oliver's Beerbohm (1952), Geoffrey Keynes's Rupert Brooke (1954; revised 1959, 1964), John J. Slocum and Herbert Cahoon's Joyce (1953), Cecil Woolf's Norman Douglas (1954), Woolf's Frederick Rolfe (1957), Leon Edel and Dan H. Laurence's Henry James (1957; revised 1961, 1982), B. J. Kirkpatrick's Virginia Woolf (1957; revised 1967, 1980), Keynes's Siegfried Sassoon (1962), Cosmo Gordon's Lucretius (1962; revised 1985), Richard Fifoot's Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell (1963; revised 1971), Warren Roberts's D. H. Lawrence (1963), Miriam Benkovitz's Ronald Firbank (1963; revised 1982), Donald Gallup's Pound (1963; revised 1983), Philip Gaskell's Foulis Press (1964; revised 1986), William B. Todd's Burke (1964; revised 1982), Kirkpatrick's E. M. Forster (1965; revised 1968, 1985), Keynes's Berkeley (1976), Kirkpatrick's Edmund Blunden (1979), David Gilson's Austen (1982), Laurence's Shaw (1983), Richard Lancelyn Green and John Michael Gibson's Conan Doyle (1983), William S. Peterson's Kelmscott Press (1984), and Kirkpatrick's Katherine Mansfield (1989). The significance of the Soho series is suggested by Dan H. Laurence, who says that modern author-bibliography has been "inspired and influenced in large measure by the emergence" of the series ( A Portrait of the Author as a Bibliography [1983], p. 6 [cf. p. 12]), and by Anthony Rota, who criticizes bibliographies that depart from the arrangement of the "Soho formula" ( Points at Issue: A Bookseller Looks at Bibliography [1984], p. 10). An earlier indication of the influence of the series is "The Soho Recipe," Times Literary Supplement , 25 October 1963, p. 876. 44 The "Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography," beginning publication in 1972 with an advisory board consisting of Fredson Bowers, Matthew J. Bruccoli, William R. Cagle, and Charles W. Mann, includes the following: Joseph Schwartz and Robert C. Schweik's Hart Crane (1972), Bruccoli's F. Scott Fitzgerald (1972; supplemented 1980; revised 1987), J. M. Edelstein's Wallace Stevens (1973), Jennifer McCabe Atkinson's O'Neill (1974), Ernest C. Stefanik, Jr.'s John Berryman (1974), Bruccoli and Richard Layman's Ring Lardner (1976), Craig S. Abbott's Marianne Moore (1977), C. E. Frazer Clark, Jr.'s Hawthorne (1978), Bruccoli's John O'Hara (1978), Joel Myerson's Margaret Fuller (1978), Bruccoli's Raymond Chandler (1979), Layman's Dashiell Hammett (1979), Bruccoli's James Gould Cozzens (1981), Raymond R. Borst's Thoreau (1982), Myerson's Emerson (1982), Bruccoli's Ross Macdonald / Kenneth Millar (1983), Myerson's Emily Dickinson (1984), Bruccoli and Judith S. Baughman's Nelson Algren (1985), Carol Johnston's Thomas Wolfe (1987), Rodger L. Tarr's Carlyle (1989), Bruccoli and Baughman's James Dickey (1990), and Stephen Garrison's Edith Wharton (1990). The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, publishing through the University Press of Virginia, began in 1978 to label its bibliographies as belonging to the "Linton R. Massey Descriptive Bibliography Series": Joe Maynard and Barry Miles's William S. Burroughs (1978), Candace W. MacMahon's Elizabeth Bishop (1980), James A. Grimshaw, Jr.'s Robert Penn Warren (1981), Stuart Wright's Randall Jarrell (1986), Wright and J. L. W. West III's Reynolds Price (1986), and Wright's Peter Taylor (1988). In the two decades before 1978, the Society had published several descriptive bibliographies, such as Frances Joan Brewer's Cabell (1957), William W. Kelley's Ellen Glasgow (1964), and B. C. Bloomfield's Auden (1964; revised 1972 by Bloomfield and Edward Mendelson). Other recent series are the "Pall Mall Bibliographies," published by Dawson (Folkestone, Kent), and the "St. Paul's Bibliographies," published by the firm of the same name (Godalming, later Winchester). The "Pall Mall" series includes A. F. Allison's Thomas Lodge (1973) and Robert Greene (1975) and M. R. Perkin's Abraham Cowley (1977). The "St. Paul's" series, which is made up of bibliographical studies (and reprints of such studies) in addition to descriptive bibliographies, has recently been organized into subseries, such as the "19th Century Writers Series" and the "20th Century Writers Series," which contain reprints (with addenda) and revisions of descriptive bibliographies published earlier (some in the Keynes and the Soho series) as well as new works—including (among those not previously mentioned) Tom Dunne's G. M. Hopkins (1978; original 1976), Michael Collie and Angus Fraser's George Borrow (1984), Collie's George Gissing (1985; original 1975), Fred H. Higginson's Robert Graves (revised 1987 by William P. Williams; original 1966); Philip M. O'Brien's particularly noteworthy T. E. Lawrence (1988), and Peter Eads's H. E. Bates (1990). (See also note 41 above.) 45 Purdy's Hardy receives well-deserved praise as a "landmark" in Dan H. Laurence's A Portrait of the Author as a Bibliography (1983), p. 13. And Marjorie G. Wynne calls it "one of the most useful, substantial, and innovative studies of a major modern author," placing Purdy "in the forefront of bibliographical scholarship," in her obituary of Purdy in the Yale University Library Gazette , 65 (1990-91), 118-120. 46 I am not attempting to list all of them here, but I shall name a few more that are notable in one way or another (and not mentioned elsewhere in the present essay): R. W. Gibson's Bacon (1950) and More (1961); Leslie N. Broughton, Clark S. Northup, and Robert Pearsall's Browning (1953); Philip Gaskell's Baskerville (1959; revised 1973); Audre Hanneman's Hemingway (1967; supplemented 1975); Edwin T. Bowden's Thurber (1968); Daniel Heartz's Pierre Attaignant (1969); Sidney L. Gulick's Chesterfield (2nd ed., 1979); Leon Voet's Plantin Press (1980-83); Joan Crane's Willa Cather (1982); R. A. Sayce and David Maskell's Montaigne (1983, on the Essais ); and Jay A. Gertzman's Lawrence (1989, on Lady Chatterley's Lover ). Two outstanding descriptive catalogues of collections are Allan Stevenson's volume of the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt (Vol. 2, 1961) and Joan St. C. Crane's Robert Frost: A Descriptive Catalogue of Books and Manuscripts in the Clifton Waller Barrett Library, University of Virginia (1974). 47 There are many subject or imprint bibliographies that provide some physical detail (such as title-page transcriptions and signature collations) for a large number of books; I single these three works out here as excellent examples of the much smaller class of bibliographies that offer even more detailed descriptions of extensive quantities of books. (The category of "short-title catalogue" obviously aims for abbreviated description; but Katharine Pantzer's great revision [1976-91] of the first "STC"—A. W. Pollard and G. R. Redgrave's A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475-1640 [1926]—makes explicit in many entries the extensive analysis that underlies such bibliographies at their best.) On the relation of subject and imprint bibliographies and "short-title catalogues" to descriptive bibliography, see my "The Evolving Role of Bibliography, 1884-1984," in Books and Prints, Past and Future (1984), pp. 15-31 (esp. pp. 23-27); and "The Bibliography and Textual Study of American Books," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 95 (1985), 291-329 (reprinted in Needs and Opportunities in the History of the Book: America, 1639-1876 , ed. David D. Hall and John B. Hench [1987], pp. 233-271)—which recognizes the lack of attention to book structure in the tradition of recording "Americana." 48 Three of these were by Bowers himself: "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 1-22; "Bibliography and Restoration Drama," in Bowers and Lyle H. Wright, Bibliography: Papers Read at a Clark Library Seminar (1966), pp. 1-25; and "Bibliography Revisited" (see note 31 above). (All three are reprinted in his collected essays [see note 23 above], pp. 111-134, 135-150, 151-195.) He also made some trenchant comments on descriptive bibliography in other essays, such as "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography, and Literary Studies" (see note 24 above), pp. 43, 48-51; "The Bibliographical Way" (see note 23 above), pp. 65-68; and "Four Faces of Bibliography," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 10 (1971), 33-45, reprinted in his collected essays, pp. 94-108 (see pp. 100-103). Two comprehensive post-1949 treatments of descriptive bibliography are Greg's 1959 introduction to his pre-Restoration drama bibliography (see note 20 above) and Allan Stevenson's 1961 introduction to the second volume of the Hunt catalogue (see note 46 above), pp. cxli-ccxliv. Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), though it contains only a brief chapter on the writing of bibliographical descriptions (pp. 321-335), provides essential background for any examination of books as physical objects. The two dozen other major studies supplementing Bowers's book—by Gavin D. R. Bridson, Willem Daniel Margadant, Allan Stevenson, David L. Vander Meulen, and me—are listed in my "A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary," SB , 40 (1987), 1-30 (see pp. 3-5). A more extensive list appears in my course syllabus, Introduction to Bibliography: Seminar Syllabus (Literature G4010, English Department, Columbia University, 12th revision, Fall 1990; distributed by the Book Arts Press, Columbia University School of Library Service, 1991), pp. 49-52. (Some of these essays, and some others, were reprinted by John Bush Jones in Readings in Descriptive Bibliography [1974].) Some thoughts about current directions in author bibliography, and their relation to publishing and textual history, are offered by David McKitterick in "Author Bibliographies," Book Collector , 32 (1983), 391-393, 395-396, 399-402, 405-406, 409-410. For a superb account of what present-day descriptive bibliography at its best involves, see Vander Meulen's Where Angels Fear to Tread (see note 8 above); and for two model reviews of descriptive bibliographies, see Vander Meulen's review of Gilson's Jane Austen in PBSA , 79 (1985), 435-442, and B. J. McMullin's review of Bettye Thomas Chambers's Bibliography of French Bibles (1983) in Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 10 (1986), 1-24. 49 I have summarized the story briefly on three retrospective occasions: "Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century" (see note 18 above), pp. 68-74; "The Evolving Role of Bibliography" (see note 47 above), pp. 17-23; and "Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942," in the forthcoming volume commemorating the Bibliographical Society's centennial. I have also attempted to tell the story in more detail for two areas, American authors and eighteenth-century British authors: "The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors," (see note 41 above); "The Descriptive Bibliography of Eighteenth-Century Books" (see note 37 above). See also my "Bibliography and Science" (see note 19 above); "The Literature of Book Collecting," in Book Collecting: A Modern Guide , ed. Jean Peters (1977), pp. 209-271 (esp. "Bibliographies and Checklists," pp. 234-248); and "The State of Bibliography Today," PBSA, 73 (1979), 289-304 (esp. pp. 297-300)—reprinted in The Bibliographical Society of America, 1904-1979: A Retrospective Collection (1980), pp. 542-557 (esp. pp. 550-553). 50 The role of bibliographies as biographies is suggested by the title of Dan H. Laurence's Engelhard Lecture, A Portrait of the Author as a Bibliography (1983). Laurence (author of two Soho bibliographies, on James [with Leon Edel, 1957, 1961, 1982] and Shaw [1983]) points out how the modern bibliographer has "assumed the mantle of the biographer" (p. 13), engaging in "the graphic recreation of the subjects' lives in the context of their professional business involvement and experience; of their struggles and frustrations and yearnings reflected through commercial intercourse" (p. 17). (Laurence is rightly intolerant of the volumes listing collectors' "points" that appeared in the 1920s and 1930s, but he does not do justice to the real value of "points" in the serious examination of physical evidence [cf. pp. 11-12].) Another treatment of the biographical aspects of descriptive bibliography is Scott Bennett's "The Profession of Authorship: Some Problems for Descriptive Bibliography," in Research Methods in Librarianship: Historical and Bibliographical Methods in Library Research , ed. Rolland E. Stevens (1971), pp. 74-85—in which Bennett conceives of a bibliography of Howells as telling "how he made a living as a writer—what sort of life he made" and bringing us "nearer to that man and to the world in which he lived" (p. 84). Cf. note 60 below. 51 See my "Non-Firsts," in Collectible Books: Some New Paths , ed. Jean Peters (1979), pp. 1-31. 52 On this point, see my "The Concept of Ideal Copy ," SB , 33 (1980), 18-53. For a thoughtful, if brief, discussion of the relation of checklists of works to descriptive bibliographies of physical books, see D. W. Krummel, Bibliographies: Their Aims and Methods (1984), pp. 34-36 ("The Physical and Intellectual Book"). 53 For example, Donald Gallup, the author of widely praised bibliographies of T. S. Eliot (1952; revised 1969) and Ezra Pound (1963; revised 1983), has stated, "Special details necessary to distinguish between states or issues of particular books may be added here and there without the bibliographer's being obliged to encumber the whole bibliography with data which for most of the books would be superfluous"; more specifically, he claims that "Collation by signatures is unnecessary for most contemporary books except in special cases" and asserts that for modern books an indication of leaf size is "of little use to anyone" and that title-page transcriptions "would seem seldom to be essential" if photographic reproductions were supplied. See his "'Boobliography' and Ezra Pound," Texas Quarterly , 10.4 (Winter 1967), 80-92, reprinted as On Contemporary Bibliography with Particular Reference to Ezra Pound (1970); the quotations are from pp. 20, 8-9, of the latter text. (Gallup is called the "most revered of contemporary bibliographers" by Anthony Rota in Points at Issue [see note 43 above], p. 11.) Another example is David Foxon, author of a distinguished bibliography, English Verse, 1701-1750 (1975), which provides signature collations (usually) and notations of watermarks (sometimes) but not quasi-facsimile title-page transcriptions; in his Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), he disparages such title-page transcription because it is generally not necessary to identify editions. I have responded to the arguments of Gallup and Foxon in "Title-Page Transcription and Signature Collation Reconsidered," SB , 38 (1985), 45-81 (which includes references to other discussions of these two subjects). 54 Liebert, who had been president of the Bibliographical Society of America in 1964-65, delivered this talk, under the title "Bourbon Old-Fashioned Bibliography," at the BSA annual meeting on 26 January 1973. He had earlier delivered it, under the title "Bibliography Old &amp; New," as the third Lew David Feldman Lecture in Bibliography at the University of Texas; it was published in the Library Chronicle of the University of Texas , n.s., 4 (1972), 11-22, and as a separate in 1974. Page references are to the latter publication. 55 On the first point, he says, "The purpose of all this is to assume the cloak of the wizard and to support esoteric professional standing" (p. 11). On the second: "I think the fad for machines has pushed it [bibliography] past the point where judgment of the significance of data is more important than the accumulation of them" (p. 18). 56 He does favor "investigative work" if the resulting data are digested and shown to be meaningful (p. 20). But the presence of numbers seems to trigger an automatic response: "some recent bibliographies are more like tables of logarithms or tides" (p. 20); "Bibliographers do not need to hide behind an assumed cloak of scientific professionalism by the use of numbers and tables and symbols. Let them go honestly about their work" (p. 21); "Let us not seek to establish the worth of our studies or our own professional status by resort to a scientific apparatus of symbols, mensuration, and statistics" (p. 24). An egregious recent example of this point of view is John Byrne's review (blatantly entitled "Sense over Science") praising J. Howard Woolmer's bibliography of the Poetry Bookshop (1988) for its lack of "mumbo-jumbo" and "quasi-chemical formulae," asserting that the "foremost requirement [of a bibliography] is an incontrovertible identification of the item to hand" ( Times Literary Supplement , 10-16 March 1989, p. 247). 57 David Vander Meulen, after examining seventy-five copies of one edition of the Dunciad (and eight hundred altogether) and recording more details than any other bibliographer (of any author) has probably ever recorded, speaks of "the alluring joy of the work" and "the thrill of the chase," and he concludes, "Bibliography is fun" ( Where Angels Fear to Tread [see note 8 above], p. 28). Liebert compares bibliographers with biological taxonomists, who he says fall into "splitters" and "groupers" (pp. 15-16); but the "splitters" do not always, as Liebert suggests, create categories based on irrelevant evidence, and the work of the "groupers" must be regarded as superficial if it does not accommodate the complications produced by the "splitters." 58 The "fundamental purpose" of a bibliography, he believes, is to tell people "what edition it is that they have" (pp. 11-12). His praise of favored bibliographies takes this form: "They have told me everything I have needed to know about the books of which they treat, and nothing that I did not want to know" (p. 20). An appropriate reply (made in a different context) comes from D. W. Krummel: "The best way to kill bibliographical scholarship is to persuade readers that citations that fail to expose bibliographical details still tell them all that they need to know" ("Citing the Score: Descriptive Bibliography and Printed Music," Library , 6th ser., 9 [1987], 329-346 [see p. 345]). 59 Although William P. Barlow, Jr.—in his Engelhard Lecture, Book Collecting: Personal Rewards and Public Benefits (1984)—says that "Collectors are not scholars" (p. 21), the tenor of his remarks as a whole shows that his approach is indeed scholarly (cf. his explanation for acquiring multiple copies: "not only to provide a copy of each known state but to search for unknown states" [p. 10]). 60 Liebert does say later that books are "parts of men, and usually the only surviving parts of those men" (p. 25); but in the same sentence he says that books are "not sterile, inert entities that can be fully contained in a collational formula," as if those who use formulas, or examine books as "machine-produced items of merchandise," thereby ignore the connection of books with human beings. On this point, as on so many others, David Vander Meulen is exemplary: as a bibliographer of Pope, he certainly uses collation formulas and investigates book production in detail, and he believes that the process brings him "not only closer to the minds and actions of those who manufactured the books but also, ultimately, into the presence of Alexander Pope himself" ( Where Angels Fear to Tread [see note 8 above], p. 28). 61 Of course, the achievement of a printer actually consists of physical objects, and descriptive bibliographies of printers, like catalogues raisonnés of painters, provide verbal accounts of visual end products rather than of objects that serve as intermediaries. 62 The process of reading letters, diaries, or business records—like the process of reading poems and novels—requires an attempt to understand every feature of the objects conveying the texts. 63 "What Haunts Thee in Fond Shapes," in The Life in the Studio (1969), pp. 3-12 (quotations from pp. 9 and 7). This exquisitely crafted piece is a classic expression of the evocative power of objects.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Editing Piers Plowman B: The Imperative of am Intermittently Critical Edition by Robert Adams *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">". . . they very often found mistakes in their exemplar where, so far as can now be discerned, none actually existed. . . . [T]he wording of the exemplar seemed less good than they themselves could make it." G. Kane "Two things there are, upon which the very Basis of all verbal Criticism is founded and supported: The first, that the Author could never fail to use the very best word, on every occasion: The second, that the Critick cannot chuse but know, which it is. This being granted, whenever any doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, first that the author could never have us'd it, And secondly, that he must have used That very one which we conjecture in its stead." A. Pope When George Kane published his edition of Piers Plowman A in 1960, he readily acknowledged the necessity—in certain situations—of allowing one's copy-text to stand unrevised by critical scrutiny (152-156). The cases in question were those where the ambiguity of the textual evidence, or the evenness with which it was balanced, or its paucity, prevented the attainment of a valid critical reading. Fortunately, however, relatively few textual problems in A seemed to him of such obscurity as to preclude editorial discrimination. By 1975, when Kane and E. T. Donaldson published their edition of the much longer B version, even fewer situations appeared to require a merely passive assent to copytext. Now the editors believed themselves able to correct the inferred B archetype by comparing it to parallel passages in A and C , the earlier and later versions of the poem. 1 Thus they hoped to restore not only many substantive readings garbled in the extant manuscripts of B but also the minutiae of the authorial style, which scribes had tended to blur through the process of repeated copying. This attempt at restoration led them to displace many strongly attested B manuscript readings. Shortly after the appearance of the Kane-Donaldson edition of B , several reviews expressed skepticism about this feature of the editors' approach, as well as about what the reviewers took to be an undisciplined application of eclectic methodology in general (e.g., Turville-Petre, Pearsall, Fowler). Since that time, however, only Lee Patterson and Charlotte Brewer have examined the matter extensively. Patterson's discussion, though acute in noting some of the incompatible philosophical assumptions behind the Athlone project (71ff.), is broadly enthusiastic and sounds rather naive in its notion that Kane can somehow validate his editorial practice on an abstract plane where it remains mystically immune to particular falsifications (65, 68-69). 2 Eclecticism as an editorial approach may indeed be unimpeachable by any number of examples of its imprudent application, but surely the only yardstick for measuring the success of a particular editor's practices—and the only one that Kane himself will accept (1975, 220; 1989, 185)—is our estimate of the percentage of correct reconstructions in his text. By contrast, Brewer's assessment of Kane-Donaldson is both sharper in tone than Patterson's and more consistently insightful concerning the specifics of their editorial decisions but may miss the mark in its categorical rejection of Kane's editorial criteria and the means by which they were formulated (89; see Appendix 1 for a detailed review of Brewer's argument). Meanwhile, the Athlone editions have established themselves as the definitive scholarly texts of Piers Plowman , with the first two volumes having been reissued in 1988 and the Russell C version imminent. In the course of its success, the Athlone project has managed to bequeath its brand of eclecticism to a number of later editors, some of whom have applied the method with a full measure of Kane's boldness but with little of his intuition and philological expertise. Yet it has also stimulated, among certain younger medievalists, an unfortunate distrust of all "eclectic" approaches to textual editing (e.g., Bowers). Reacting against the sometimes feigned, sometimes exaggerated empiricism of the Athlone B version, yet also attuned to a stylish nihilism prevalent in recent literary criticism, these scholars have sensed an erosion of the epistemological confidence necessary for systematic discrimination of textual variants and have begun urging, in effect, a return to "best-text" editions of medieval works (cf. Kane's description of this movement: 1988, 195-196). Their efforts to act as go-betweens in contemporary theory's courtship of indeterminacy are sometimes inadvertently seconded by older scholars whose skepticism about critical editions is more pragmatic than programmatic—grounded in plentiful, sad experience of the very real limitations circumscribing any attempt to recover authorial text from a complex scribal tradition. For such disillusioned veterans it is enough if the version in question can be claimed as historically credible, as an example of "what actually was read by the poet's near-contemporaries." The current penchant for studying scribal versions—and treating scribal errors as instances of medieval literary criticism (cf. Windeatt, passim , and Pearsall 1985, 103, with Kane 1988, 194)—attests to the same skepticism. Such factors also probably account, in part, for the extraordinary popularity of Jerome McGann's approach, which defines the production of literary meaning as a collective, public endeavor (with the author at the center of a complex matrix of influences) rather than as an isolated act of creative self-expression (47-48, 81). Where Piers Plowman is concerned, the most tangible manifestation of this textual relativism is seen in recent efforts implicitly questioning the established classification of the extant manuscripts into three discrete versions (Pearsall 1985, 99-100; Bowers). 3 Much of this study may likewise seem—to those whose predilections are described above—aimed at undermining the possibility of any critical edition of Piers Plowman B. Nevertheless, I am generally in agreement with the Athlone editors in regarding the aforementioned trend as an unhealthy one (Kane 1989, 208). My own outlook is moderately eclecticist 4 and my only quarrel with Kane and Donaldson, though a very extensive one in its ramifications, concerns the level of evidence necessary to displace copy-text or archetype with a hypothetical reading. Essentially, the problem with Athlone is this: while Kane allows in theory for the possibility that available textual evidence may be inadequate to support any critical judgment, in practice he and Donaldson rarely refrain from making such judgments and seldom impose on themselves exacting standards of evidence. Instead, they prefer to shift the burden of proof to the B arche-type, whose authority they find it convenient to impugn. Though Kane admits that scribes did, in fact, frequently copy accurately (1960, 126), he and Donaldson also know that the extant copies of B point to an archetype that contained many undoubted errors and therefore feel entitled to treat these witnesses (even when they all agree among themselves) as guilty until proved innocent. Usually the B manuscripts can establish their veracity (in cases where the versions overlap) only by their happening to agree with the version of the text chosen by Kane in his edition of A or with the version reflected in their preferred C manuscripts (Huntington MS 143 and BL MS Add. 35157). Failing that, the editors feel completely free to choose between B variants without regard to attestation and on grounds that sometimes appear to be little more than ad hoc rationalizations (cf. 1975, 163, concerning the primacy of "discrimination as a determinant of originality . . . above that of attestation"). A more candid and disciplined approach would begin by acknowledging that a considerable number of the paradigmatic textual situations in Piers B are so fraught with ambiguity as to preclude isolating any single variant with recognizably superior claims to originality. 5 Oftentimes the Laud or Trinity reading seems altogether plausible, but other witnesses offer one or more similarly credible competitors. In some of these cases, a close inspection of all aspects of the problem will tip the scale; nevertheless, frequently the Laud or Trinity reading can be supplanted only by arbitrarily preferring one particular hypothesis and ignoring comparable ones that might be adduced in favor of the copy-text or the inferred B archetype. In a second class of situations, the archetype is obviously corrupt, but one can readily suggest three or four possibilities that would suit all of the requirements of the text for meter, alliteration, style, and sense. In either of these circumstances, attempting to rationalize a chosen reading purely on the basis of eclectic principles seems futile and tends to undermine the authority of the method in its proper sphere. In instances of the first sort, one should simply follow the copy-text, or correct it, where necessary, to conform to the archetypal reading. As for examples of the second kind, a patently defective archetypal reading certainly cannot be allowed to remain in our edited text; one of the more acceptable readings must be selected, but the reader should be informed—in the textual notes—that the choice was, within the range of possibilities available, arbitrary rather than reasoned. Then the other viable emendations may be listed and evaluated. 6 To do otherwise tacitly invites the reader using our text to overlook difficulties rather than to confront them. There is, of course, no special authority residing in any single lection of the inferred archetype of a medieval poem with such a confused textual history as that which must lie behind Piers Plowman . Even so, a neutral base of this kind serves two modest but essential purposes: it fulfills the editor's practical need for a consistent source of merely viable readings (in the numerous instances where a more probable variant cannot be located) while also reminding editor and reader alike that the critical task is not primarily speculation but adjudication—and that adjudication can only operate in the presence of sufficient evidence. Hence the best feasible text of Piers Plowman B would be one that had been critically scrutinized throughout but whose synthetic readings 7 were confined to cases where significant differences of likelihood between variants may be discerned. When offered by the editor, a synthetic reading (whether purely conjectural or not) should establish its rights by its superior "fit" in the immediate or general context, or by its ability to account for the erroneous production of its competitors, or by its greater conformity to the accepted norms of contemporary literary usage (grammatical, lexical, or metrical) and, where possible, by its correspondence to undoubted samples (or, at least, statistical profiles) of our author's own corpus. Ideally, it should also be able to show a plausible pattern of attestation in its favor. 8 Such appeals must assume the burden of proof rather than shifting it, in the manner of a French prefect, to the documentary defendants. 9 As long ago as 1960, Kane would have found this kind of editorial policy rather timid-something less than a true eclecticism. Thus he comments in the prolegomena to A that If the obligation to correct occasionally is accepted, the scope of textual criticism cannot thereafter logically be restricted, but will have to extend to all variants, since to set a limit to it at any point requires an exercise of judgment at least as arbitrary as any undertaken during comparison of variants. (146-147) Implicitly lumped together in this argument are two very different editorial policies, both of which are repudiated by Kane but without sufficient distinction having been drawn between them. The first is that of the editor who prints from a single manuscript (except where its contents are manifest nonsense); the second is that of the editor who scrupulously examines all of his textual evidence but who refrains from drawing quibbling distinctions between virtually equal variants and thus often must follow his archetype or copy-text faute de mieux . Whatever Kane might have thought of the latter approach thirty years ago, his own well-known audacity and rigor were considerably tempered, during the editing of A , with prudence and flexibility. Yet by the time that he and Donaldson produced their edition of B some fifteen years later, the bolder side of his editorial persona had won out. It is only natural to wonder why this occurred. Finding an answer may gain us some valuable insights into the ruminations of perhaps the greatest modern editor of medieval vernacular texts, as well as an enhanced appreciation of the perils inherent in all eclectic editing. In seeking such an answer, we must begin with an understanding of the crucially different textual traditions embodied in the A and B manuscripts. Apparently, it was a failure, early on, to appreciate the full import of this difference that led Kane to develop, in the editing of A , habits of mind, specific editorial practices, and even particular textual commitments that would serve him poorly during the B project. 10 Seventeen authoritative manuscripts of the A version survive, arranging themselves, roughly, into one family of six (T, R, U, D, Ch, H 2 ), one family of four (E, A, M, H 3 ), two pairs—(V, H) and (W, N)—and three unrelated manuscripts, J, K, and L. This arrangement is complicated by that fact that W appears to become part of the AMH 3 group in Passus 9-11 (after E has lapsed) and by the general tendency observable in all of these groupings for convergent variation (whether by inspired correction, contamination, or mere coincidence) to obscure truly genetic relationships. Faced with the task of editing these manuscripts by recension, Knott had sought to explain away the self-contradictory evidence of his A collations by positing a considerable number of changes of exemplar in the copying process (402-403, 412); but surely Kane is correct in objecting that the means by which this state of affairs came about is less important than its consequences: while the basic family relationships seem secure, they are contradicted so frequently that, lacking a gift of clairvoyance, editing by classical recensionist principles is simply impossible (1960, 84-85, 114). The salient factors in this situation are, therefore, (1) that we have a rich variety of witnesses so arranged that they provide at least three or four independent sources of testimony for almost every point in the text of the poem, but (2) that those witnesses quite frequently disagree with each other over a fairly wide spectrum of textual possibilities (even within putative families), so that (3) the archetypal reading is often open to some doubt but, where inferable, generally sounds cogent, stylistically effective and, thus, very likely to be authorial. Furthermore, no single manuscript, even T (Kane's copytext), is sufficiently free from corruption to make a "best-text" edition plausible. The circumstances could scarcely be more favorable, or more challenging, for applying the methodology of "eclectic" discrimination. Like the A version, Piers Plowman B is represented by well over a dozen manuscript witnesses. As in the case of A , most of these are from the fifteenth century though they tend, on the whole, to be datable earlier in the century than the A manuscripts. While two manuscripts of B and an authoritative printed text 11 date from the sixteenth century (G, S, and Cr respectively), between four and six may date to the last years of the fourteenth century (W, Bm, Bo, C, and perhaps L and R). By contrast, only MS V—and Z for those who reject its status as a separate version—among the A witnesses has a claim to comparable antiquity, though at least two others, the AC splices T and Ch, are thought by Doyle to have been written "in good anglicana formata of c. 1400" (46). Though the number of authorities for the text of B is, then, roughly the same as for A —sixteen as opposed to seventeen—and of approximately the same vintage, the text to which they bear witness could scarcely be more different in its editorial status. For one thing, the family relationships among the B manuscripts are much more defined and predictable, though trivial convergent variation is frequent (a persistent phenomenon in all three versions of Piers ) and sometimes obscures them. Moreover, there are, in general, far fewer substantive variations between the text of B in any two of its manuscripts than is true of A . 12 A cursory glance through the bands of lemmata at the bottoms of pages in both Athlone texts will suffice to validate this point. This sounds very promising for the possibility of editing by recension; and in fact much of the archetype of B is recoverable (cf. Kane 1989, 212; 1948, 5) by a loose kind of recensional formula, viz., when mss W, L, and R agree in a reading—especially if supported by M, G, Cr, or Hm—one can usually be fairly certain that the reading thus attested was found in the common parent of all the extant B manuscripts. Unhappily, it is precisely here that B begins to pose problems unparalleled in the A tradition. While A almost always provides three or more discrete witnesses to its readings, the hypothetical stemma of B offers—at best—only two lines of independent testimony regarding its point of origin. Of these, Schmidt's limb alpha is witnessed by a mere two manuscripts, one of which has suffered sporadic losses of text (R) while the other (F) is notably eccentric and heavily sophisticated. At times, therefore, our glimpse of the common B parent is limited to a single reliable viewpoint (that of beta = W, Hm, Cr, G, Y, O, C 2 , C, Bm, Bo, Cot, L, M, H), and the security of any inferences about its nature is always qualified by our never having more than two angles of vision. Far more serious in practice, however, is a second difficulty. The inferential archetype of the extant B manuscripts, though definable with greater consistency and certainty than that of A , was obviously corrupt to a significant degree. This is especially clear in the second half of the poem (Passus 11-20), where comparisons with parallel passages of C reveal more than 50 failures of alliteration alone. 13 Moreover, this common ancestor of the surviving B copies tended to lapse occasionally into lumps of two or three lines of flat, prosy paraphrase. Of course obvious versification errors also occur with some frequency in the A tradition, but they are much more troublesome in B because of the narrowness of the stemma and the tendency for such faults to affect all witnesses. B , therefore, if approached conventionally and by itself, is deceptively easy and rather less glamorous to edit than A , affording fewer opportunities for clever reconstructions or discriminations of variants; but the resultant text will reflect some significant archetypal blemishes that cannot possibly be effaced unless one is willing to undertake an almost continuous collation of the text with those of the other two versions. Kane had been unwilling to follow such a method when editing A , and for a very good reason. As he had correctly perceived then, emending any version of an authorially revised document on the basis of such collations depends on the editor's being able to ascertain whether the passage in question has been subjected to small, sporadic changes by the author. But accurately judging the ephemeral indecisions of a poet who died some six centuries ago is, in many instances, impossible. As Kane himself points out, In theory all variations of corresponding lines in the three versions might afford indications of a common, presumably unrevised original form of such lines. In practice the intrinsic likelihood that the authorial revision responsible for the major differences between versions will also have introduced smaller differences, makes it impossible to say of many lines whether their various forms in the three versions originated with scribe or author . The editor of any version is thus restricted to the evidence of the variants in manuscripts inferentially descended from the archetypal copy of that version. He will employ the evidence of variants from other versions only in certain special circumstances . . . . (1960, 147, n. 1; italics mine) Yet when Kane and Donaldson came to edit the B version, they found themselves entangled in well over 1,000 "special circumstances," nearly 700 of which involved them in replacing an archetypal B -version reading with one from A and/or C. Kane realized that such a massive number of exceptions constituted a de facto change of editorial policy and admitted as much in a tersely worded note to the prolegomena of the Athlone B edition: "The editor of A now considers that he allowed insufficient weight to readings from other versions in his editing, and that his earlier view of the situation . . . was mistaken" (75, n. 15). Was the inferential B archetype patently defective to a far greater degree than even the Athlone editors had initially suspected? Hardly. A four-year study of these myriads of "special circumstances" has convinced me that considerably fewer than half can safely be presumed to attest to archetypal B corruption. A startling number of the remainder exemplify tiny and trivial differences whose relative authenticity Langland himself would have been hard pressed to certify. How one chooses to handle cases of palpable and significant archetypal errors (comparison with A and C does reveal over 250 such instances in B ) will invariably pose a number of difficulties for any editor of this multi-versional poem; had Kane and Donaldson simply failed to anticipate this problem, which is particularly acute in the B version, there would have been no need for this survey of their work. But such is not the case. Hundreds of the purported errors listed in their chapter on "The Archetypal B Manuscript" show signs of special pleading, of having been martialed in behalf of a viewpoint already formulated. Why would the Athlone editors have been drawn to exaggerate the defects of an admittedly less-than-perfect B archetype? To see why that course was tempting, we must review briefly the theoretical and practical commitments that Kane had made in the 1950s while editing A . Faced with the impossibility of editing A by recension, but having at nearly every point a rich variety of witnesses to its text, Kane had opted to evaluate each set of A variants purely on its own merits. In doing this, he had the advantage of certain heuristic tools of analysis developed by earlier eclectic editors from working with classical texts and the New Testament (Kenney 21-74), where stemmatic reconstruction usually lacked feasibility. According to one of these rules of thumb (the lectio brevior ), when faced with an amorphous group of variants one should generally favor the briefer reading. The assumption here is that scribes tend to be more verbose and emphatic than authors. Similarly, one should prefer difficult or obscure readings (the lectio difficilior ) to obvious or easy ones on the assumption that scribes are less likely than authors to employ hard words or constructions, whether the difficulty be lexical or grammatical. On the contrary, their tendency will be to smooth out authorial usage into predictable syntactic frames and commonplace phrases and perceptions (Kenney 43; Kane 1960, 130, n. 2, citing Griesbach). Thus, all else being equal, one should give greater weight to variants that reflect archaic or unusual linguistic usage than to their more obvious competitors. In general, the assumption underlying the use of these tools is that spurious readings will tend to distinguish themselves from genuine ones by the ease with which they may be accounted for as having arisen from those genuine ones, either deliberately or subconsciously, by one of several processes familiar in the copying of all handwritten texts. Of course neither of the aforementioned principles has any compelling logical force in itself; but they seem sufficiently rooted in common sense and observation to provide an editor with a means of assessing probabilities in cases where little or no other evidence can be summoned (a frequent problem with both classical and biblical texts, in which early witnesses are rare and contamination is not). In attempting to apply and extend these rules of thumb, Kane initially measured their usefulness against a controlled sample of textual situations in A where manuscript evidence overwhelmingly favored a particular variant and where, in consequence, there was little doubt about authorial intention. He was encouraged by the discovery that they did, in fact, appear to predict originality successfully in many instances (127). So accurate did they seem that he came to believe these principles could be used even to overrule the manuscripts in selected cases where the latter plainly supported an easier or more explicit reading (148-149, 158). In other words, he employed a limited base of textual evidence to formulate canons that would allow him to overrule majority attestation in other circumstances. As Kane summarizes the entire process, one must apply to textual cruces "the knowledge of characteristic scribal behaviour gained from passages where the direction of variation is scarcely in doubt, hoping by this means to establish presumption of originality among available readings" (146). Brewer has argued that, in doing this, Kane involved himself in circular reasoning (75ff.). 14 Whatever hypothetical force such an objection may carry, in practice Kane seems on fairly solid ground: many contemporary scientific theories are developed in the same way and for the same purpose, viz., to allow us to filter out anomalies from the very body of data which underlies our hypothesis. One might add that, in the case under discussion here, two (theoretically discrete) bodies of data are involved (readings from the A tradition—whose stemma is very broadly based—and readings from the B tradition—whose stemma is never based on more than two inferred witnesses). Thus Kane and Donaldson do not necessarily contradict themselves in using majority readings in A to formulate principles by which they can often reject majority-attested B lections. 15 A more serious theoretical objection is that Kane's reasoning perpetually flirts with the fallacy of converse accident. 16 He and Donaldson begin by inferring (validly, I believe) that principles undeniably illustrated in hundreds—if not thousands—of textual situations apply generally throughout the poem; however, they then proceed to apply these heuristic devices inflexibly and pervasively, as though the fact of their general relevance guarantees their applicability to particular cases, regardless of the uniqueness of those cases. Moreover, they frequently seem to opt for the first hypothesis that occurs to them and overlook the possibility that two or more competing eclectic principles of explanation may require weighing against each other. While Kane is quite correct in noting that textual editors always must settle for less than strict proof (1960, 148), his account of his procedures in editing A sometimes appears to imply that the mere act of explaining how a rejected reading might have arisen is tantamount to establishing that it did arise that way. Likewise, at certain points, the discussion leaves one with the impression that Kane believes in a form of the "coin-toss" fallacy of classical probability theory: that our being able to account for one set of problematic variants by means of some particular eclectic principle actually increases the likelihood that the same principle can be validly applied to the next, unrelated crux (e.g., 1960, 127-128, 145). To be sure, Kane avers, near the end of his prolegomena to A , that each crux is unique and that he has tried to prevent any of his "various resources for determining originality . . . from becoming rules" (165); readers must judge for themselves how far either of the Athlone editions actually embodies this strategic concession. My own impression is that neither does very well but that the problem remains almost wholly theoretical in A , whereas its consequences are more tangible in the B edition. The reason for the difference resides in the fundamentally different textual situations typical of the two versions. In A we frequently encounter such a wide range of viable variants, variants showing little or no correlation with assumed stemmatic relationships, that one is reduced to the bare necessity of choosing between them on the basis of some rationally plausible and consistent principle, however slender. With B , on the other hand, where the range of variants is customarily narrow and the common parent often easily inferrable, more substantial and contextually specific evidence is necessary to support a non-archetypal lection since a rebuttable presumption of authenticity, however minimal in many cases, attaches to any reading shared by the putative progenitors of B's alpha and beta limbs. In formulating eclectic principles for editing A , therefore, Kane skirts serious theoretical difficulties; but it is hard to see what other general approach would have worked better, if one were to do more than merely publish a facsimile of MS T. In truth, no editor who aims at recreating an authorial text can avoid repeatedly using some set of heuristic principles. The greater danger is entirely practical: recognizing the specific contexts where these tools are likely to be helpful and what their limits are. Although they are sometimes spoken of as if they were predictive and prescriptive rules resembling the laws of Newtonian physics, the usual principles of eclectic editing are, in their actual application, retrospective and descriptive, like the laws that explain historical phonological changes. When we are confronted with a lection that we suspect as scribal, these rules offer us some typical patterns of scribal behavior that may account for the unauthentic production of that lection. But they can seldom give us more than marginal assurances that the word or phrase in question did in fact arise in any particular way, and they can never predict in advance exactly what will happen when a given scribe confronts a designated piece of text. Instead, they provide a probability-based confirmation of suspicions that we have already entertained on other grounds, whether stylistic, grammatical, or historical. Ideally, they should act as a check on editorial intuitions of originality by causing us to question whether our favored reading could plausibly have stimulated scribes to generate its rejected competitors; but all too often they are in fact dragooned into rationalizing such intuitions. This happens because these rules tend—especially in hard cases—to be highly context-specific and easily reversible; that is, they often represent opposite sides of the same editorial coin. Thus, if we have ill-advisedly chosen a very precise and vivid phrase as authentic, we will be strongly tempted to dismiss another plausible variant as scribal for its tendency toward blandness or flatness (Kane 1960, 134) or even censorship (138). Conversely, if we have been taken in by an actual case of scribal censorship or euphemism, we will easily defend our choice by labelling its more striking competitor "overemphatic" and "lacking in subtlety." Consider, for example, the famous crux in B Passus 7 concerning Piers's resolve to change his manner of life: does he swear to be less busy about his bilyue (as Kane and Donaldson emend on the basis of two A manuscripts) or about his bely ioye (as all B manuscripts uniformly attest)? Leaving aside the question of authorial revision (which can hardly be ruled out in this case), one way of addressing the issue is to ask whether bely ioye seems overemphatic to us (hence the work of a vulgarizing scribe) or whether bilyue seems somehow euphemistic and vague (produced by the vulgarizing scribe's brother—the timid, flaccid scribe). 17 As with the issue of comparative emphasis, deciding which of two readings is the more difficult can frequently become perplexing. In a given set of variants, one word may be much rarer lexically, but its competitor may, as part of the phrase before us, reveal a subtler or richer meaning or a less typical syntax. 18 Though recognizing that "hardness" may be of various kinds, Kane and Donaldson occasionally underestimate the potential complexity of such situations and tend to prefer lexical "hardness" above all (see Appendix Two). In other instances, we find ourselves in situations where there is little doubt as to which of several choices constitutes the harder reading but where it is often problematic—as Kane himself notes—to distinguish a harder reading from a variant "that make[s] nonsense or present[s] 'some perverse and distorted grammatical complication'" (1960, 159). 19 Thus the judgments we must make are in fact controlled by a three-value logic, not a bipolar one. Harder readings must be distinguished not only from easier ones but from impossibly hard ones. In sum, the categories of common scribal error help only to authenticate our decisions; they do not make them for us, except in the easy cases where we would not have needed them anyway. 20 For the most part, Kane's edition of A qualifies as a consistent and rigorous example of critical reasoning in employing these standard tools of eclecticism, but it is by no means clear that he ever articulated to himself the exact nature of the practical dangers that his intuition was usually avoiding. This may partially explain why he and Donaldson are less fortunate in employing these tools in their editing of B . Another of the snares encountered by the Athlone editors in working with B is also foreshadowed in Kane's A version: reductivism. Kane tended to approach A 's cruces monistically, viewing virtually all textual anomalies as consisting of a single correct reading to be discerned plus a host of erroneous ones to be eradicated. It is probably true that the entire Greg-Bowers tradition of eclecticism vaguely encourages such an unrealistic expectation, but Kane and Donaldson did little to resist it. The consequences are twofold. First, since in the majority of ordinary cases a single correct lection does indeed lie hidden behind the garbled readings of the various witnesses, editorial monism lures one into believing that that original lection (however nugatory the difference between it and its competitors) can nearly always be ascertained and that one's duty lies in doing so. And no sooner has one decided that monosyllabic adverb X is slightly likelier to be authorial than its rival, Y, than one also notices that Y's occurrence may be accounted for in terms of some familiar category of scribal error. So great is our relief at having successfully drawn such a fine distinction that we are disinclined to ask whether our favored choice might likewise be dissolvable in the same critical acid—much less to ask whether the total mass of textual evidence indicates that our author was indifferent to the tenuous distinction that we have just made and might, in fact, have used the two monosyllabic adverbs interchangeably. Thus, where editorial modesty would dictate simply following some base manuscript for indeterminable cases of this kind, our text instead becomes hypercritical and claims more for itself than is feasible. 21 This is the only objection that I would register, for example, against Kane's and Donaldson's editing of the last two passus of B , where they use a number of readings from C manuscripts to repair the B archetype. Precisely because the C manuscripts reveal that there has been no substantive change in these passus—and thus authorial revision can be no factor—Kane and Donaldon were entitled to infer that C sometimes preserves a better state of this section of the B text than that reflected in the B manuscripts. In a large majority of cases involving Passus 19 and 20, then, their inferences seem astute and certainly carry a preponderance of likelihood if not inevitability. But even here common sense tells me that they have occasionally gone too far, as when they imagine themselves able to decide between to ( C 21.164) and for to ( B 19.164) in the b-verse "Iesu to / for to seke." At least one of the C manuscripts, Camb. Ff.5.25, agrees on this reading with B and the difference is far too tiny to attempt to resolve by classical eclectic analysis anyway. 22 The same exact variants are discriminated by Kane and Donaldson at B 19. 360/ C 21.360 in the phrase "Conscience to / for to teche." Similar cases, approximately a dozen in all, are decided with equal confidence, including such spidery fine dilemmas as preye versus And praye ( B 19.357/ C 21.357), to þe versus to ( B 19.197 / C 21.197), and or versus or ellis ( B 20.228 / C 22.228). The second consequence of editorial monism is that it predisposed Kane to discount the possibility that some variants in the extant A manuscripts may be authorial variants. 23 Granted our awareness that Langland repeatedly revised his poem over a period of many years, what more likely than that some of the better pairs of variants in surviving copies of A reflect ambiguities in the author's own mind and copy? Yet Kane effectually rejects this hypothesis. Why? Because it creates untidy problems to think about. Such a utilitarian attitude is patent in his offhanded and grudging acknowledgment that Where two variants leave nothing to choose between them the possibility of both being authorial must be allowed, however little it helps the editor . But the number of such instances is diminished by knowledge of the several typical scribal responses to copy. The frequency of variation in the A manuscripts is, as a principle, to be explained without reference to the undemonstrable hypothesis of . . . extensive revisions by the author. . . . (145; italics mine) This description makes it sound as though we are obliged to opt for a known fact (scribal error) over an undemonstrable hypothesis (authorial revision), but the truth is that, where Langland is concerned, both factors seem equally certain in general yet sometimes difficult to distinguish in particular cases. What we cannot assume a priori (cf. Kane 1988, 184) is that we know which of these factors is likelier to be at work in producing a specific set of variants. We can only guess at that as we come to have a feel for the unique features of each successive textual situation. In essence, authorial variation as an important factor in the determination of A readings appears to have been ruled out categorically rather than case by case. 24 To have done otherwise would have risked exposing the fragile contingency of the usual tools of critical analysis—designed, as they are, to ferret out no more than a single authorial reading uniquely embodied in distinctive language. By the time work began on the editing of B , therefore, Kane and Donaldson were already committed to a system and a text. First, they were committed to testing variants by means of some double-edged but venerable eclectic principles that had proved quite valuable in editing A . These techniques tend to yield more ambiguous results with B , where one has not only to speculate on the usual scribal motives for departing from copy but also on possible authorial motives for fiddling with the phrasing of A . If the variant in question is relatively inconsequential and isolated, determining its authenticity can be troublesome. Secondly, Kane and Donaldson were committed to a pair of procedures that were quickly to prove incompatible when applied to B (that is, a rigorous analysis of all relevant textual evidence versus a cautious refusal to employ evidence from other versions of the poem). The problem here was that their collation of B was revealing, as already noted above, a sizeable number of corruptions in the archetype of the extant B copies. Hence the temptation to invoke readings from the other versions, even if it made a mess out of logic and their prior methodology. Finally, they were saddled with a whole host of specific textual choices already made in editing A —choices that (so they seem to have believed) would have to be defended in B , however poorly attested there, since identical or virtually identical lines often occurred in that version. Though these difficulties must perforce be described separately, they actually constituted three facets of the same editorial challenge: how to evaluate and deal with minute, sporadic authorial revision. None of these problems appears to have been anticipated, and the failure to do so probably has a fairly obvious explanation: when Kane was editing the A version during the 1950s, there seemed to be no need for a close and continuous monitoring of the lectional evidence from parallel passages in the other two versions. In many cases he appears to have had only vague ideas of the attestational array or the various lectional possibilities in B and C . Nevertheless, not sloth but serious editorial scruples caused this state of affairs. To have done otherwise would have been to tamper with the jury of his own mind by introducing inadmissible evidence. 25 After all, he had already decided concerning these parallel passages that it would be "impossible to say of many lines whether their various versions originated with scribe or author" (147). Hence, "the readings of the B -version and . . . those of C , can never be treated as primary authorities in determining originality for A " (157). One can easily imagine Kane's and Donaldson's discomfort, therefore, when they began to examine their B collations. The evidence they found there must often have seemed concocted by a malicious fate to expose the inadequacies of the reasoning adopted in Professor Kane's edition of A . Wherever there were parallel passages, the problem kept cropping up: a lection endorsed as authorial in A would turn out to be only weakly supported in B . In fact, in far too many instances it was altogether unsupported. Instead, presenting itself with unanimous or near-unanimous witness, would be a completely different reading—sandwiched into an alliterative line otherwise indistinguishable from one in A . So what was the difficulty? Cannot authors fluctuate in revising their work, even where relatively polished phrasing is concerned? Yes, to be sure, but, as the Athlone editors must have realized, in this matter degree is everything. Hence they were willing to concede that a limited amount of trivial authorial variation does occur between the versions of Piers . Not to have done so would have seemed too self-serving. They would have had to rewrite hundreds of tiny examples like that in B 7.171, which reads, "That Ioseph was Iustice Egipte to loke ." Its analogue in the A -version reads identically except that the last stave word—unanimously supported by the A manuscripts—is kepe . In C we find the very same line, but now its final stave word is saue . Hardly a major issue of style or substance, but in this example Langland exhibits the same self-doubts and fussiness, or inattention to detail, that afflicts the rest of us at times. 26 A similar case occurs in Passus 10 of B , but here Kane and Donaldson felt obliged to intervene. Will's friendly reception at the home of Clergy is being described and the Dreamer tells us that there "Was neuere gome vpon þis ground, siþ god made þe worlde / Fairer vnderfongen" (230-231). An unexceptionable set of verses? So one might imagine; but in the A version Langland appears to have written "siþ god makid heuene" (173). In these circumstances the editors emended B to conform to A and tried to convince themselves that B 's choice for its final stave word constitutes a stale scribal substitution whereas A 's phrase is so much fresher as to preclude the possibility of Langland's having written both. Thus although occasional examples of minute versional variation could be passed over with a judicious silence, Kane and Donaldson could not acknowledge the authenticity of a sizeable number of such petty changes—changes that frequently seemed to result in no measurable improvement of the line and sometimes appeared to weaken it. If they had conceded the reality of this state of affairs, they would have been undercutting the mystique of a specially privileged authorial sensibility (cf. Bowers' recent assessment of Hoccleve's many inconsequential revisions). And this kind of mystique was essential in guaranteeing the monistic inevitability of the process by which Kane had discriminated scribal variants in A . 27 But sometimes the problem was even more acute. A considerable group of these troubling but strongly attested B lines that differed in small ways from the equivalent lines in A turned out to differ specifically in that they embodied readings that had already been rejected in the editing of A , readings that then had seemed to Kane either not quite so good or less broadly attested than the readings that had been adopted. The unique features of many dozens of these lines are clearly archetypal in B , and in a majority of these cases no one would ever have suspected these B readings of having scribal origins. Nevertheless, Kane and Donaldson presumably feared that to allow them into the Athlone B version would have invited mockery of the eclectic principles by which these same readings had been rejected in A , where their occurrence had almost always been attributable to some known category of scribal error. 28 This is, in fact, exactly why Kane and Donaldson could not leave the second of my two aforementioned examples as they found it in the B manuscripts, for they knew that one of the A manuscripts, Ch, also reads "seþ god made þe world" rather than "siþ god makid heuene" at this point. Consequently, denial of this lection's authenticity in B was almost a foregone conclusion: to allow it to pass there would be to concede that revising authors and erring scribes can sometimes change texts in ways that are either attributable to the same causes or, at the least, indistinguishable in their results. 29 Identical motives appear at work in their treatment of a tiny variant in B 3.284. The archetype of the b-verse of this line read: "for kynde wit me it tauʒte." Kane and Donaldson choose to excise the direct object, it , on grounds that the phrase is awkward and excessively explicit. They prefer Kane's choice from the A version: "for kynde wit me tauʒte." Most readers would fail to see how the editors can justify a change of this sort on such slender grounds. Would Langland himself have noticed such a change? But once more, what is really at stake is more subtle than the perennial editorial myopia that causes each of us to imagine himself able to distinguish fly specks invisible to others. In this case the problem is that a whole set of A manuscripts (T, R, U, D, Ch, H 2 ) had read " it me tauʒte" and Kane had already disallowed that possibility as stylistically inferior. Unfortunately, because he lacked a computerized record of his choices, Kane's prodigious memory here failed him; hence on several later occasions in the poem—notably, passages where A offers no reading and thus no potential embarrassment—he and Donaldson were quite willing to allow that the authorial usus scribendi might encompass such structures as "me it + transitive verb." In fact, at Passus 18.351 they allow the very phrase, "me it tauʒte," as authorial. Similar considerations may explain the extraordinary respect shown by Kane and Donaldson for the most eccentric of the B manuscripts, Oxford Corpus Christi MS 201 (known as F). Since nearly 100 of their emendations in B depend on this manuscript alone, the editors are obliged to opine that F's scribe had access to a B manuscript superior to the archetype of the extant copies and that he occasionally corrected himself from that source. In reality, there is no doubt that the F scribe was sophisticating, that he collated and at times conflated several copies with his own exemplar. One such copy may well have been an exceptional B manuscript, but the evidence adduced by Kane and Donaldson seems easier to account for on a more mundane supposition, one already noticed by Schmidt: i.e., F agrees many times with the Kane A version against the other B manuscripts because at least one of its conflational sources was an A manuscript (275). 30 Significantly, Kane and Donaldson invoke the authority of F in 67 different instances where an A version reading agrees with it, but in cases where there is no corresponding A line (that is, over nearly 70% of B 's text!), they use it only 31 times to displace the common B reading. In only 17 cases out of the 98 where they substitute F for B x do they employ it with support exclusively drawn from C manuscripts (the other 14 cases concern passages not found in either A or C ), and in only 8 of these examples is the F reading clearly identical with the C archetype. The real proof of the pudding is seen in how often Kane and Donaldson cite F as the basis for their emendation but then actually choose a reading from Kane A that is similar to but not identical with F. 31 It is also worth noting that, in 32 out of the 67 aforementioned cases where the editors invoke an isolated F reading because of its support for the text of Kane A , one or more A -version manuscripts supports the generic B reading that Kane and Donaldson are seeking to efface! Were Kane and Donaldson, therefore, simply deceived in imagining that the A and C versions could be used to purge archetypal corruption from B ? Should they have held steadfastly to the versional impartiality and agnosticism announced in the A version? Not altogether. In some cases they must surely be correct. There are, for example, about a dozen occasions where, when B is defective in alliteration, a stave word found in both the other versions may confidently be supplied. Out of a total of some 150 instances in the Athlone edition where A and C agree against B and are used to emend it, approximately half are necessary or probable. Some of the other half are highly improbable and many fall into the category of "possible, but far from necessary and having no more intrinsic probability than the B archetype's alternative." An example of a close call occurs in Passus 10.5a, where Kane and Donaldson emend B to conform to A and do so with some plausibility. Here the archetypal B manuscript must have read, "'Wel artow wis,' quod she to wit." By contrast, the A version archetype read, "'Wel artow wis, wit,' quod she." No great matter is involved here, but it seems somewhat unlikely that, having once composed a syntactically tight, effective half-line like A 's, Langland would later have written the looser, more awkward phrase of B . Moreover, it is easy to explain how the process of copying could have started from the reading in A and ended up producing the version seen in the B archetype. In fact, it is already apparent among the A manuscripts, no less than three of which agree with the B archetype. Four other A manuscripts read the verse, "Wel artow wis, quod she" and altogether omit the vocative "wit" from the verse. Apparently, the omission resulted from eyeskip, with the phrase "wis, wit" causing "wit" to be dropped. Then other scribes, sensing the need to clarify the person being addressed in this line, restored the reference by means of a following prepositional phrase, "quod she to wit ." As Greg observed long ago, the easier it is to account for a mistake, the easier it is to suppose that the mistake may have happened more than once (1927, 20, n. 1). Thus Kane must have felt fairly secure in invoking the principle of coincidental convergence to explain archetypal B 's agreement here with a rejected A -version reading. Even this example, however, is less clear than it first appears because it looks as though the C archetype also may have read "quod she to wit." When faced with this possibility we can, of course, continue to invoke the principle of coincidence. If we do, we will say, " A and B scribes made such an error, so why not the archetypal C scribe as well?" In an unknown number of cases, such a line of defense must be correct, and it will always protect our hypothesis from direct falsification. However, when summoned in the face of every attestational embarrassment, it has the correlative effect of progressively eviscerating our theory's probability. On the other hand, if we forego this defense of the proposed emendation, we are left contemplating two distasteful possibilities: (1) that some scribe in the A tradition inadvertently made the line better than it was originally; or (2) that after scribal corruption had occurred Langland either failed to notice or was content to accept the inferior reading in B and C and thus conferred upon it his implicit blessing (cf. Russell 1962, 42-43). The second of these alternatives looks somewhat more probable, but it forces us to ask ourselves whether our editorial duty includes rescuing our Wordsworth from apparent lapses of attention and taste, 32 or whether our duty is to the work he produced, however inferior it may have been (in isolated instances) when compared to his own earlier effort. 33 In posing the issue of our editorial allegiance, I am not aiming to beg the question at stake with Kane, viz., "to what degree does the inferential archetype of the extant B manuscripts adequately represent Langland's original of that version?" But our judgment about this matter cannot be held hostage to programmatic notions about our author's customary excellence; instead, it must be continuously reformulated in the light of each textual situation. We will, to be sure, eventually arrive at a general view of this relationship, but it can never be allowed, as Kane and Donaldson appear to have done on many occasions, veto power over the unique specifics of the particular variant array. There are, of course, dozens of cases where the evidence for interversional emendation is stronger than in the aforementioned example. 34 But B 10.5a still represents, with all of its deceptive simplicity, a fairly typical locus for editorial intervention. Unfortunately, many of the targets for this activity in the Athlone edition of B seem much less warranted. In situations where only A and B share a line, my calculations suggest that nearly 80% of the Kane-Donaldson emendations from A are unnecessary and show little or no superior probability. It might seem that, wherever both of the other versions agree against B in reading a shared line, we would be fairly safe in emending; but things are seldom so simple. Even if we put aside the intrinsic likelihood that Langland must sometimes have changed his mind in revising from A to B , only to change it back again while reworking B to C , 35 we are left with many cases that are hardly transparent or compelling. Sometimes the agreement of A and C is itself the questionable product of a tenuous chain of inference. That is, similar arrays of variants may exist in all three versions but with strikingly different proportions of attestation. Having chosen one of these in editing A , the editors are inclined to choose the same variant in C , however weakly attested; then, in spite of their aversion to stemmas, they vote these two inferential archtypes against a nearly unanimous B reading. 36 Convergent variation thus transmutes the most intransigent lemmata into clarity. Above all, Kane and Donaldson are unwilling to allow that Langland might occasionally have lapsed into revisions of merely scribal quality in B , only to repent and rediscover the merits of his more felicitous original in C (cf. Kane 1989, 210-211, concerning the "postulate of excellence"). And yet our own experience as writers demonstrates every day the probability of just such an occurrence. Another curious feature of the Athlone methodology is how little scope it appears to grant to contamination as a factor in explaining some of the suspicious situations where a variant strongly attested in one version will also appear in two or three isolated copies of another. Of course Kane was well aware of gross lateral transmission between the versions and documented dozens of instances (1960, 30-31) in which whole groups of authentic B or C lines are somehow injected into A -version copies. When this happens, an editor's obligation to his version is clear: he must excise the alien material. However, neither Kane nor Donaldson ever really addressed the problems posed by the same phenomenon when it occurs on a smaller scale than that of the line or paragraph. 37 Potential cases of micro-contamination were usually interpreted by Kane as instances of coincidental convergent error, with the preferred variant (i.e., that chosen in his edition of A ) being original to all versions and the rejected one having arisen spontaneously in each version through independent scribal error. 38 Donaldson, by contrast, once seems to have accepted the possibility of considerable memorial, if not collational, micro-contamination (1955, 183)—and, by implication, the idea that more than one variant in a given set might be authorial—but provided no guidance for detecting the phenomenon or dealing with it. Yet the likelihood is that such micro-contamination did happen—repeatedly but unsystematically. The early copyists betray no realization that the poem exists in three different, autonomous versions. 39 The most that can be said for them is that they were aware that some of the circulating copies were longer or more complete than others and that some seemed to contain better readings than others. The survival of numerous interversionally spliced copies attests both to this scribal ignorance and to their employers' demands for the fullest, most accurate text of the poem available. These two factors alone make it probable that some of the more complex sets of shared A / B / C variants result from individual lections (both authorial and scribal ones) having passed between manuscripts of different versions (cf. Kane 1960, 55, n. 1, where Housman's claim for sporadic lectional contaminations in Juvenal manuscripts is cited). How often it happened is less clear. We know that it took place in the sixteenth century, and there is every reason to believe that it occurred in the fifteenth as well. Among the A manuscripts, MS Harley 6041 (H 2), a composite AC manuscript, shows numerous (usually trivial) marginal and interlinear "corrections" throughout in a different, later hand and ink. These interpolations all come from an unknown B manuscript. The extraordinarily high percentage of isolated, archetypal B readings in MS Society of Antiquaries no. 687 (M, another A -version copy) suggests that something similar happened to one of its ancestors. The same may be true of the now famous MS Bodley 851 (Z). 40 I have already mentioned that a process of this kind probably influenced MS F of the B tradition. The combination of many inconsequential agreements—and some highly significant ones—between early parts of B MS G and the A tradition (against the evidence of all other pure B manuscripts) invites the hypothesis that a similar process of sporadic microcontamination affected one of G's ancestors (viz., its exemplar for Prologue-Passus 7). 41 As for the most blatant of these cases, the evidence of his ink suggests that the sixteenth-century corrector of H 2 set himself the task of marking this manuscript for medial pauses (by reference to another copy already so punctuated) and scribbled interlinear corrections only when his eye happened to notice interesting discrepancies between H 2 and his checking copy. Presumably the corrector used a manuscript of B for this task not because he had a deep interest in the subtleties of Piers Plowman textual variation but because it was the copy most readily available to him. From our perspective it would seem worse than counterproductive to proof a copy of one version of a poem against a copy of a different version, but such cross-checking of the text of Piers Plowman versions can be done more easily than might be imagined. The trick lies in the macaronic character of the poem. As a rule, the hundreds of Latin tags are set off by rubricated or stylized lettering, making them readily useable signposts to specific parts of the poem's three recensions, in which many passages are closely parallel. We can observe the scribe of MS Hm 114 (or one of his predecessors) doing this very thing in the copying of Passus 3 of B . The gist of his text leaves no doubt that his primary source here was of the second version of the poem. Moreover, at this early stage in his work he has not begun the wholesale mixing of batches of lines from each version that characterizes the later passus of his copy. But several times we catch him consulting parallel passages of an A and a C manuscript and adding to his copy a Latin scriptural citation not found in the B archetype. 42 Doing this leads him to notice small differences of phrasing in the English text, and occasionally to contaminate his exemplar, as when he alters "Yiftes or yeresyeues bycause of hire Office(s)" ( B 3.100) to "Gyftes or presentes in ʒougþe or in elde" (cf. A 3.89). Although MS K of the A version parallels this line in Hm 114 perfectly, it seems likely that the substitution in these two manuscripts of "presentes" for "yeresyeues" (which is archetypal in both A and B ) is the product of mere coincidental convergence, an illustration of the process whereby scribes sometimes create the illusion of textual affiliation by choosing identical easier synonyms in eliminating hard words. On the other hand, the occurrence of "in ʒougþe or in elde" in Hm 114 requires a different explanation. Here there is no doubt that the phrase in question is archetypal in A but illegitimate in B , which reads "bycause of hire Office(s)." Someone in the Hm 114 tradition found this very distinctive—though bland—reading in an A copy and, for whatever reason, thought it more authoritative or appealing than the B reading it replaces. Perhaps he was dubious of the metricality of the B archetypal line (= aaa/ xy). 43 His motive may have been as simple as an illegible patch of copy in his exemplar, but similar small examples in this and other manuscripts sometimes seem explainable only in terms of the uneven whimsy of a poetaster. 44 Ironically, the same process appears to have happened the other way round with MS W of the A tradition. Someone in the transmission history of this manuscript chose to evict the native A reading ("in ʒouþe or in elde") in favor of the B reading ("bycause of hire Offices"). Thus the existence of the same pair of alternative readings in two versions of Piers does not automatically prove the presence of any error at all, nor the accidental convergence of scribal inadvertencies; rather both versions will, on the odd occasion, have originally contained a separate authorial reading and each in turn will have been deliberately "corrected" (i.e., contaminated) from the other tradition. This same state of affairs occurs at times on a larger scale. That is, an A manuscript (or several of them) will have acquired the B version of a particular passage, while one or more B manuscripts will reproduce the A version of the same passage. For example, at B 3.51-62, manuscript pair R/F omit the B version and read instead three lines that correspond to the A version of this passage. Conversely, MS N of the A tradition witnesses the much longer passage original to B/C ! Various explanations are conceivable for this example, including mere coincidence. 45 But with some sets of interversionally shared variants, one cannot rule out the possibility that, at an early stage of transmission, a heavily revised authorial foul copy (with ambiguously marked interlinear and marginal afterthoughts) was repeatedly used, both as exemplar and checking copy. 46 If, in fact, this took place, it would follow that some of the contamination is authorial in origin. Under such circumstances, especially where versional exchanges of individual words or brief phrases are concerned, the bipolar logic of the Athlone method breaks down; so it comes as no surprise to see that the editors will have none of this. Adducing lateral transmission is all very well when one is explaining the impossibility of genetic recension within a given version (Kane 1960, 53-114 passim ), but the three versions are conceived of as hermetically sealed off from each other—at least at the level of the individual lection. After all, only such a theory of independent vertical transmission will allow tacit re-introduction of stemmatics at a later stage so as to emend B by mechanically voting A and C against it. Much of the discussion hitherto merely elaborates in a theoretical context points made by various reviewers more than a decade ago. My final point, however, has never before been addressed. As soon as we accept random lateral transmission as a significant (though far from exclusive) cause of the shared variants mentioned above, 47 another methodological difficulty comes into clear focus: Athlone B 's massive application of interversional stemmatics must partially—if unconsciously—hinge on an obscure and unprovable hypothesis concerning the three versions' order of publication. The Kane-Donaldson operational assumption was that publication order corresponded to compositional order (which, since Skeat's work, has been confidently established as A&gt;B&gt;C ). Yet only George Russell has ever articulated anything resembling a detailed description of this hypothesis—perhaps because it seemed so obvious and commonsensical to his colleagues. 48 Having overestimated (in my view) the role of coincidental convergence in producing parallel sets of variants among the three versions, Kane and Donaldson seem to have attached little importance to the question of publication order. All that one needed to know for editing a poem whose versions were genealogically discrete in vertical descent was the order in which the author had composed them. But if intermittent, often trivial, microscopic contamination did characterize the early scribal history of the versions, collating A and C variants against B to find B 's archetypal errors (though far from valueless or impossible) would require more sophisticated and cautious methods than those actually applied. 49 Similarly, if the versions were not released in the same order in which they were composed, scribal perceptions of the relative authority of their divergent readings might well have differed from ours, and the direction of influence (i.e., for memorial as well as collational contamination) might not coincide with what we would expect from compositional order. Of course any discussion of this kind must remain speculative, for—barring the discovery of fresh manuscripts—relevant evidence concerning the actual order of publication of Piers A, B , and C is slim and ambiguous. One clue—dialect distribution of the extant copies—seems compatible with the Athlone hypothesis but can hardly be said to strengthen it. 50 Several others, equally slim, raise doubts about it. Thus Doyle's recent paleographical study of the manuscripts concludes that the oldest extant manuscripts are of the B and C versions, not of A (36 and passim ; cf. Parkes's estimate of Trinity College, Dublin, MS 212 cited in Kane 1985, 912). In both cases we possess a significant number of manuscripts apparently produced before the end of the fourteenth century. Surviving copies of A , on the other hand, seem noticeably later than we might have expected for a "first edition": all but Vernon and Bodley 851 clearly consignable to the fifteenth century and many to its middle or latter half. 51 Similarly intriguing is the fact that A copies were, on at least four separate occasions, completed by splicing them to C conclusions but never, so far as we now know, by using B (cf. Kane 1988, 181, 186 for the view that this circumstance is merely accidental). And yet B appears to have circulated more widely than C. Many extant B copies show a multilayered complexity of dialects typical of London production (Samuels 240-241) but also indicative of a wider circulation (and more extensive recopying) than that achieved by the C version, whose pattern of dialect distribution is tightly focused in the southwest Midlands (cf. Russell's opinion, n. 48 above). Concerning C 's range, Samuels observes: "That such a distribution could have been the work of a colony of western immigrant scribes in London seems unlikely in the extreme. . . . Such a concentration of C-MSS in dialects of the south-west Midlands is unlikely to have come about without an authorial presence in the area, and Skeat's view that the author returned to Malvern in later life is thus shown to be highly probable" (240). What, then, are we to make of the anomaly that puzzled Russell, viz., that B , which has always been the most popular version of the poem, reveals a remarkably homogenous—though uneven—text and a tightly bifid stemma (perhaps suggesting a tradition that never consisted of many manuscripts)? The answer that seems best to account for these facts is that B was not only the earliest version of the poem released (indeed the only one sanctioned by the author himself) but that the reproduction of its text was, in the beginning, rigidly though unintelligently controlled by some presumably non-authorial agency (cf. Kane-Donaldson 42, on the production of Bm/Bo/Cot). Despite the obvious deficiencies of that text, B quickly achieved something like a canonical status (modern parallels easily suggest themselves). This status allowed its unique readings—the bad as well as the good—in later decades to infect, in both subtle and blatant ways, various manuscripts of the other versions—especially A copies (since C remained largely confined to a small and remote region). Nevertheless, it survives in slightly fewer copies today than the less influential A and C versions because of the greater volatility in London literary fashions, which must have made it look much more outdated (and controversial?), by the middle of the fifteenth century, than its cognates would have seemed in Norfolk or Herefordshire. 52 To conclude, though one cannot place much weight on the slender clues provided by paleography and dialectology, they do at least suggest an alternative hypothesis concerning publication, one that seems fully as likely as the one taken for granted in the Athlone project. Namely, that A (though representing an earlier state of the poem than B ) was, because of its fragmentary nature, virtually unknown (may not even have circulated among a coterie) and passed with Langland's other papers and the incomplete C version into the hands of a literary executor. 53 Kane and Donaldson are themselves inclined to believe in the existence of such an executor (127). If such a set of circumstances occurred, and the transmission histories of A and C were in the beginning briefly intertwined 54 (the only A manuscript with numerous Worcestershire dialect features is Vernon, the oldest), then one of the reasons why surviving A and C manuscripts often seem textually closer to each other than to B would have nothing to do with their "superior" quality. Another problem that this might partially account for is the commonly occurring situation where only A and B parallel each other and where a reading of the B archetype is reflected in one or more of the A manuscripts. As noted above, the Athlone methodology assigns the usual cause of this phenomenon as "coincidental convergent variation" and archetypal B is therefore convicted of corruption. A likelier explanation in some of these cases is that scribes already familiar with the earliest published version (i.e., B ), reacted against different readings they found in A and replaced them from memory or by deliberate collation with B readings. 55 Such an explanation is far from all-encompassing and should not be construed as a monolithic replacement for coincidental convergence. 56 Rather, it is grounded in the realization that similarly suspicious textual situations can arise from a variety of causes, some of which do not diminish an archetype's credibility. Such an approach allows us to acknowledge that, in most cases, Kane was probably right about the correct reading of the A version, but it also affords to B the customary assumption of innocence denied it by the Athlone editors. That is the essence of my methodological reservation about the entire Athlone project. Certainly one would be remiss to aim at merely reconstructing the archetype. In essence, Skeat did that. And Professor Kane is assuredly right when he reminds us that perfection is not a viable alternative. Whatever method we adopt, and however flexible we are in adapting it to unanticipated situations in our text, we will sometimes err. But in editing as in law it seems essential that we decide in which direction we will err—either by convicting some of the innocent or by letting some of the guilty go free. I think far less offense is done to the integrity of our author's text and to our own daily experience of the complexities of composition by the latter policy than by the former. I would not be understood to be invoking the analogy of an American criminal trial and to be insinuating that the archetype must be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt before emendation occurs. Civil procedure's requirement of a preponderance of the evidence is all I would ask. But the burden of proving should be on the editor, not the archetype.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix 1 Charlotte Brewer believes that Kane's entire approach to editing A is vitiated by his having based it on two defective premises: (1) that only one variant in a given set can be authorial and (2) that an accurate description of scribal usus scribendi can be formulated by generalizing from cases where originality is not in doubt (i.e., in practice, those instances where one variant's correctness is vouched for by a sizeable majority of genetically unrelated witnesses). Concerning (1), Brewer notes the intrinsic likelihood that some of the "better" rejected variants in extant A manuscripts may reflect minute authorial revision within the A tradition. Regarding (2), she objects that Kane's method is circular since he begins by appealing to attestation but then uses the principles derived from these examples to repudiate attestation in other cases. Her second objection (discussed on p. 15 and in accompanying n. 14) seems, to me, to misconceive the relationship between data and hypothesis. As for the first, Kane was surely ill-advised to dismiss the possibility of authorial variation within the A tradition but I cannot concur that this (1) undermines his entire method or (2) necessitates a complete re-editing of A according to the principles applied in Athlone B (these two assertions cohere rhetorically but are probably incompatible logically). Clearly, Brewer's most forceful argument for authorial variants having survived in extant A manuscripts lies in the fact that certain minority A readings are also widely supported in B and/or C. There are, then, perhaps slightly more than 300 separate instances (out of 2,441 lines) where Kane's editing of A would have benefited theoretically from collating the lectional evidence of the other two versions in the way that he and Donaldson did for B. Nevertheless, in only a comparatively small number of these cases does such a comparison reveal strong likelihood that Kane's choice of readings in A was wrong. In many, the manuscript evidence suggests instead that the author of B either incorporated scribal readings from an imperfect A copy that he was using or coincidentally revised away from his original A reading in the same direction already chosen by one or more A scribes. In such examples, therefore, minority A readings would indeed be witnessing to authorial variation, but not to authorial variation within the A tradition. In other instances, Kane's preferred explanation for all of these phenomena is probably correct, viz., that some A scribes coincidentally erred in the same way that the archetypal B and/or C scribes erred and thus the appearance of authorial variation is an illusion. In still others, isolated lectional contamination of A manuscripts by hypercorrection from B/C seems the likeliest explanation (see p. 32 ff.). Finally, some cases (especially, pairs of roughly equivalent A variants in lines unparalleled in B/C ) appear to invite Brewer's hypothesis of authorial indecision (or "retouching") within the A tradition. However, positing the existence of an extensively (albeit sporadically) revised exemplar of A as the primary means to account for "good" minority variants in surviving A manuscripts appears to violate the principle of economy; after all, these variants themselves are the only real evidence that such a document ever existed and yet most of them can be accounted for on other grounds (including later authorial production in known, extant revisions of A , e.g., B and C ). Since Brewer has conceded Kane's judgment that the surviving manuscripts of A all derive from a single basic draft of that version (78), and differs from him only in suggesting that certain rejected variants may have originated from intermittent authorial "retouching" of that draft, one must ask what set of editorial results she would have preferred to Kane's? Do the manuscripts in which these rejected variants most commonly occur (viz., the EAMH 3 , WN, and VH families) faithfully reproduce the poet's "revised" choices? That seems indeterminable, for the occurrence of these variants follows no consistent pattern such as might imply that these manuscripts all derived from a single "retouched" document. Furthermore, the only common features to these variants are (1) that George Kane rejected them for Athlone A and (2) that many of them also appear in Bodley 851 (Z) and B . The notion of authorial variation within A appears, thus, to have minimal practical impact since it comes down to the idea that Kane's reading is usually defensible, but so—on some occasions—is another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix 2 Some Athlone rejections of archetypal B variants as "easier" readings exhibit a rather casual disregard for the distinctive features of versional context. Thus at 5.195 the B archetype presumably read, " And in a tawny tabard of twelf wynter age." Kane and Donaldson emend this to read, " In a [torn] tabard of twelf wynter age." The truly striking emendation, "torn" for "tawny," has a very good chance of being right. But what has happened to the archetype's "And"? The answer is that this conjunction is not found in the archetypes of either A or C. The editors have accordingly suppressed it as a symptom of the well-known scribal tendency toward explicitness and parataxis. However, they have also overlooked key differences between the versions here that make this judgment less than apt. First, the A version lacks the three lines immediately preceding B 5.195, the most important of which is B 5.194: "Wiþ an hood on his heed, a hat aboue ." C , on the other hand, has a near-equivalent which reads "With his hood on his heued and his hat bothe ." By contrast with C , archetypal B ends line 194 with a locative preposition ("above") and begins line 195, if unrevised from A , with another locative preposition ("In"). The combination is awkward and momentarily disrupts the reader's perception of what is being described: "Is Avarice's hat tucked into a tabard that he wears on his head?" The addition of "And" breaks this clumsy syntactic pattern and prevents the misreading. So Kane and Donaldson were correct in sensing that its purpose was "smoothing." But they were probably wrong in imagining that we owe this helpful touch to a scribe's intervention. When Langland came to revise B to C , he noticed a way to clarify the relationships here without sacrificing tightness, viz., by changing "above" to "bothe." The change forfeits very little in vividness and enables him to do without the clarifying conjunction introduced in B. Surely such small progressive changes are exactly what we should expect of an author? An apt illustration of how one can overlook contextual complexity while seeking to apply the criterion of the "harder" reading is provided by B 6.179. Archetypal B here read "Ne hadde Piers wiþ a pese loof prayed hunger to cesse," while AC presumably read the b-verse of the same line, "preyed hym byleue." At first glance one is strongly inclined to endorse the choice of Kane and Donaldson to emend B ; its phrase sounds inferior by comparison and is certainly more explicit. Moreover, it eliminates an obsolescent word, byleue , replacing it with a commoner synonym, cesse . Our initial verdict begins to seem doubtful, however, once we notice that the line(s) immediately following this phrase have been revised extensively in both of the later versions. In A , this phrase describes the first of a series of actions Piers takes to protect the folk against Hunger. Grammatically, the format is of a familiar contrary-to-fact sort, cast in the past subjunctive: "Had Piers not done x, and y, and z, and had the physician not done q, they [the folk] would have been dead etc." By contrast, in B all of the stipulations separating the first subjunctive (Had not Piers prayed Hunger to cease) from the conditional conclusion (they would have been dead) are excised. The larger effect is almost certainly beneficial. Some vivid details are sacrificed, but the stylistic result seems tighter and the key idea of the passage (massive death avoided) now seems more forcefully presented. Unfortunately, the elimination of the intervening A material, where Hunger's name is reasserted, obscures the reference point of hym in preyed hym byleue ; thus Langland revised the phrase so as to make it more explicit. But when he re-examined this passage in revising to C , he still appears to have been dissatisfied; and the dissatisfaction seems to have been with the wording rather than the ideas. Now he chooses to restore the key phrase from A, preyed hym byleue , which is obviously stronger on its own merits than B's preyed Hunger to cesse . But he is able to do so because he has once again decided to tinker with the following line, a plea cast in direct address from Piers to Hunger ("Haue mercy on hem, Hunger, etc.") so as to clarify the auditor's identity by re-asserting his proper name (cf. B 's "'Lat hem lyue,' he seyde"). Why did Kane and Donaldson fail to note these small points? For one thing, there are countless thousands of such details in every passus—too many for any editor ever to feel certain he has observed them all. But, more important here, I suspect, was their tendency to focus too exclusively on lexical rarity (i.e., the obvious superiority of byleue to cesse ). This matter rendered the entire phrase suspect in their eyes. They might well have asked themselves, "Why would an author replace a relatively rare word with a more common one in his first revision, only to revert in his final revision to the more archaic term with which he began?" In one sense, such a question is unanswerably complex and is far from being the rhetorical question (with an obviously negative answer) that they appear to have imagined it. On the other hand, one superficially plausible answer may be supplied immediately, viz., that the B version, unlike A and C in this regard, specifically addresses a London audience and shows many more concessions to the lexical limits of such an audience than A (begun either before or shortly after the author had taken up residence in the capital) and C (whose surviving manuscripts strongly suggest that he had by then retired to his native region). At any event, dozens of simple variants between the versions raise this same issue, but Kane and Donaldson appear never to have considered it from any perspective but the most narrowly editorial. A final example of this sort, where presuppositions of textual corruption in B have caused Kane and Donaldson to overlook subtle differences between versions, occurs at 9.17. Archetypal B here read, "Ac þe Constable of þat Castel þat kepeþ al þe wacche ." Athlone alters this to "Ac þe Constable of [þe] Castel þat kepeþ [ hem alle ]." Once more B has been brought into line with A and C ; "al þe wacche" is rejected as an "easier" reading. Presumably this phrase seems more obvious or explicit to Kane and Donaldson than its cognate, but that is merely another way of saying that it is slightly more vivid and appropriate as well. It seems doubtful that they would ever have replaced it on purely eclectic grounds; rather, it is the victim of covert recensionist reasoning. Two limbs of a trifid archetypal super-stemma have been voted against it and an eclectic rationale has been invoked to legitimize, and conceal, this process. Once more, however, the editors have failed to note significant distinctions between the versions. As in the case discussed above, B has enhanced the A -version passage by several details (in three new lines) before we reach the line in question. Specifically, B tells us that "Dobest is aboue boþe, a Bisshopes peere; / That he bit moot be do; he [boldeþ] hem alle ; / [By his leryng is lad þat lady Animal ]" (14-16). C preserves the first and third of these added lines but cancels the second. The explanation, then, for the shift from "hem alle" to "al þe wacche" to "hem alle" once more is found in the addition of the three new lines in B (the second of which ends with "hem alle") and the ensuing cancellation of one of them in C. Langland appears to have sensed the awkwardness of the repeated line endings in B and accordingly changed the latter (line 17) to "al þe wacche." When he dropped B 9.15 from the C version, he reverted to "hem alle" in the later line since no problem of repetition now existed.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The author wishes to thank Professor Ralph Hanna for an extensive critique of this paper and for many suggested improvements that have been incorporated into its argument. Thanks are also due to Thorlac Turville-Petre, Ian Doyle, and Charlotte Brewer, with whom exchanges on this topic have always been delightful as well as instructive. Responsibility for all judgments rendered here is, of course, exclusively my own. An earlier version of this paper was delivered as the inaugural R. E. Kaske Memorial Lecture at Cornell University, 9 November 1989. Funds for manuscript research were provided by the American Philosophical Society. 1 Some plan for systematically emending B from A and C had been intimated by Grattan and Chambers—and by Elsie Blackman—long before Kane ever came to the Athlone project (cf. Chambers 1910, 27; Blackman 1918, 518; and Chambers and Grattan 1931). 2 Patterson's inexperience with applied editorial reasoning is revealed in his inapposite critique of Anne Hudson's discussion of the notorious "bilyue/bely ioye" crux (215, n. 28). The logical force behind the principle of difficilior lectio is considerably dissipated when one is examining a set of variants where there is an a priori likelihood that more than one variant is authorial (cf. n. 18 below). Likewise naive is Patterson's notion of the role of hypothesis in the natural sciences, where—he tells us—"a theory can be disproven only by a better theory" (69). To the contrary, the history of physical science is strewn with theories wrecked by mere observation of embarrassing phenomena whose hypothetical position was not satisfactorily ascertained for decades or even centuries (Kuhn 66 ff.). 3 Those who doubt Skeat's "three-version" account of the Piers Plowman textual history often cite with approval Donaldson's own offhandedly skeptical remarks from thirty-five years ago: "I sometimes wonder whether the C-text, the B-text, and even the A-text are not merely historical accidents, haphazard milestones in the history of a poem that was begun but never finished, photographs that caught a static image of a living organism at a given but not necessarily significant moment of time" ("R and F" 211). Despite their engaging frankness, these remarks obscure some important distinctions between the extant textual states of Piers . Thus A 's particular state of truncation seems to result from a cause that is neither accidental nor fleeting, viz., a major structural (and personal?) impasse that eventually forced the author to rethink and expand his whole plan. On the other hand, B has all the appearance of a finished (albeit not final) form of the poem. By contrast with both of the earlier versions, C manifests the incompleteness and indeterminacy typical of interrupted labor (Russell 1962, 44-45) and does indeed resemble the random snapshot of Donaldson's analogy. 4 In terms of the labels sometimes applied in New Testament text editing (Fee 174-175), my position roughly corresponds to "rational" eclecticism whereas Kane's coincides with "rigorous" eclecticism. 5 Cf. Donaldson's 1955 comments (presumably withdrawn later) regarding certain cases where the majority B reading parallels the reading of A and C but the minority B reading is perfectly acceptable as well: "These involve a substitution of similars so exact that there seems little to choose between them, even if the choice were put up to the poet himself " (196; italics mine). Later in the same discussion, Donaldson notes that "In no case is there anything to choose between the variant readings despite C's support of the majority: intertextual comparison on this level is futile " (196, n. 43; italics mine). Also cf. Tim Machan's recent evaluation of the same factor (the indeterminacy of the textual micro-organism) in his discussion of variants in Chaucer's Boece (192-193). 6 Kane and Donaldson seldom see several emendations as equally probable (cf. the discussion of their editorial monism on pp. 20-22), so the second kind of problem is rarely discussed. However, it is exemplified in their refreshingly candid treatment of 19.442 (a case discussed by Fowler [38-39]), which in Skeat (19.439) and all the B manuscripts read: "And god amende the pope · that pileþ holykirke." By contrast, Athlone reads: "And [Piers] amende þe pope, þat pileþ holy kirke." It is obvious ( pace Fowler) that the alliteration of the line has suffered damage at the level of the archetype, and indeed beyond the level of the archetype since C also reflects this reading. However, there is almost no clue as to the proper way to repair the damage. In their discussion of this crux, Kane and Donaldson readily concede not only that their offering of "Piers" is purely speculative but that they themselves can suggest at least five other appropriate and likely emendations . Four of the five that they mention ("god haue pite on," "god pardon," "god make parfit," and "preie god amende") would have enjoyed (in my view) at least one advantage over their favored one, viz., preserving the line's essential meaning—which we have no cause to believe corrupt. The editors admit that, in the circumstances, "our decision is . . . arbitrary" (208). 7 I would define these as readings predicated on rejection of the copy-text or even of the archetype itself, depending on the available evidence in a particular textual situation. 8 Plausibility must always be assessed in terms of what we know about the genetic relationships among surviving witnesses. Thus in the case of Piers Plowman B , a plausible pattern of attestation might involve no more than one or two manuscripts, provided that key manuscripts supported our preferred reading. 9 Readers familiar with contemporary editorial theory will recognize a number of broad similarities between my proposed methodology for rationing emendations (with its correlative notion of the burden of proof) and that of Hans Zeller. Like my assessment of Kane-Donaldson, Zeller's critique of the Greg-Bowers approach to eclecticism focuses on the inability of that system to deal realistically with the multiple authorial variants so frequently encountered in works extant in several "authorised" versions (and its consequent tendency to produce contaminated scholarly editions). Nevertheless, my own thinking on these issues evolved independently of Zeller's influence, before I was familiar with his work—from the purely practical necessity of trying to re-edit Piers B. Moreover, his adherence to copy-text would, in application, be rather more conservative than my own—and for reasons that he well understands (240, n. 13): a nineteenth-century printer's fair copy makes for a much more consistent source of "authorised" readings than any late medieval vernacular manuscript, which, almost by definition, has suffered from contamination as well as all the usual scribal inadvertencies. 10 Whatever may have hindered him from adapting his A methodology to B 's markedly different (and more restrictive) textual circumstances, it is certainly not my intention to imply that Kane was poorly informed , at the outset of his work, regarding the actual key differences in the textual traditions of A and B. His 1948 discussion, though brief, makes clear that he was very well aware of these (5). 11 In referring to the Crowley prints of 1550 as "authoritative," I am, of course, rendering no judgment on the relative authenticity of their text. My intention is solely to acknowledge them as a source not descended from any other extant copy and therefore capable (at least collectively) of independent testimony concerning the readings that once may have existed in the archetype. In that respect they are no different from any of the other surviving manuscripts of Piers B . 12 The obvious exceptions are the sophisticated MS Oxford Corpus Christi 201 (F), the thoroughly modernized MS Sion College Arc. L.40 2/E (S), and the heavily contaminated MS Hm 114. 13 This unevenness suggests that archetypal B may have been copied by two scribes or derived from two exemplars, one of which was much weaker than the other. 14 It is ironic that Brewer brings against Kane substantially the same objection (i.e., petitio principii ) that Kane had earlier offered to classical recension. In neither case does the objection seem conclusive to me, but it underscores the problem of circularity implicit in all editorial reasoning and should remind us of the perils of any method when applied inflexibly. The pure recensionist believes that he can discover the controlling genetic relationship among his extant documents by concentrating on test cases where the relationship seems especially clear. He then merely surmises that in the more difficult or obscure cases the same fundamental relationship usually subsists. Such suppositions fly in the teeth of common sense and experience, which attest that many medieval documents are of contaminated parentage and that shared errors in them often occur through coincidence rather than affiliation. Despite its obvious differences, Kane's method involves a strikingly similar sort of rigid inductive generalization. By concentrating on sets of variants where originality seems indisputable, Kane believes that he can discern reliable, uni-directional scribal habits (a paradigm as idealized as any stemma) and thus resolve by appeals to usus scribendi the same textual anomalies that the recensionist would dissolve genetically. Yet such a programme offers its own offenses to common sense and experience, which aver that real scribal habits (as opposed to those described in manuals for editors) can go in several directions unpredictably, cancelling out or contradicting each other: "one may not assume scribes always to have gone in one direction" (Fee 185). Kane tries to place the recensionist in a logical box by asking why, if he is able to detect error without his stemma (and he must do so in order to develop the stemma in the first place), he doesn't just make all such decisions empirically, as the eclecticist would. But the question may be turned around on him, as Brewer does in essence, by asking why, if he must employ patterns of attestation to formulate his rules for scribal error, he doesn't just use attestation all the time, like a sensible recensionist or "best text" editor would. An illuminating recent discussion of ways to escape from the methodological circle faced by all editors may be found in Hoyt Duggan's "Langland's Dialect and Final - e ," 160-170, esp. 163. Also cf. his "The Evidential Basis for Old English Metrics," 157-159. 15 Brewer has generously conceded this point to me—a matter of frequent past discussion between us—in her recent assessment of Kane's work (77, n. 10), and she is quite right in also noting that Kane and Donaldson never explicitly avail themselves of such a defense. I think they took it for granted. She, however, believes that they became completely skeptical about the value of majority attestation during their editing of B (thus undermining the principles behind Athlone A ) and cites as evidence their statement that "unanimous attestation even in several traditions [is] by no means surely reliable evidence of originality" (129). Nevertheless, it seems clear to me that this statement applies, not to the unreliability of broad patterns of attestation throughout the manuscripts of the three traditions but rather to the tenuousness of even the most massive attestation as proof in any single case . 16 Lee Patterson seems momentarily oblivious to the existence of this fallacy, offering in defense of Kane-Donaldson a line of reasoning that involves both a tautology and an unintended parody of Kane: "this edition validates each individual reading in terms of every other reading, which means that if some of the readings are correct, then —unless the editorial principles have in an individual instance been misapplied— they must all be correct (69; italics mine). 17 It should be noted that this example is merely illustrative of a type of problem; in choosing to emend B 's bely ioye with A 's bilyue , Kane and Donaldson do not pose the question between these variants so simply as I have done here. For them the issue is indeed involved with the principle of authorial subtlety versus scribal overemphasis, but it is also bound up with a related question of possible mislineation in B x at 7.129-130 (i.e., they believe that by foweles has been transposed to the end of 129 when its proper position is, as in A , at the opening of 130). Such an error, if it occurred, would have necessitated scribal adjustments to both the head and tail of line 130. They conclude, therefore, that bilyue and bely ioye are equally authorial in both versions but that B x has dropped the subtler reading, bilyue , that properly attaches to Piers; has promoted the more emphatic one, bely ioye , from its original position (descriptive of the "foweles" of 129/30) to replace bilyue ; and has smoothed the resultant truncated line with worldes blisse (of dubious metricality). Cf. Anne Hudson's observations on this crux in her essay on "Middle English." 18 See, for example, my discussion of baches versus bankes ( B 5.514) in "Editing and the Limitations of the Durior Lectio," Yearbook of Langland Studies 5 (1991), 7-15. In many instances where Kane and Donaldson invoke the "harder reading" to reject a B variant that I accept as authentic, the difference between us has less to do with the respective merits of the readings than with our assessments of the general textual situation. Often I would agree with their choice—if we had sufficient reason to believe no authorial revision had taken place. Among such cases, I would include 5.554 ("he"/"wy"), 6.190 ("dryue awey"/"ditte out"), 7.146 ("in þe"/"euene"), and 9.178 ("togideres"/"ysamme"). Unfortunately, we can never have that kind of security (unless we adopt the programmatic meliorism of Greg—cf. n. 24 below) since the surviving evidence suggests a pattern of sporadic and unpredictable revision, with some passages receiving only isolated, small changes while others were completely rethought. 19 The obvious case is that of Haukyn's wife . See Alford, "Quotations," 89-94, and Alford, "Review of Kane and Donaldson," 1003, for possible theological ramifications of this reference and for a discussion of how the Athlone editors arrived at their mistaken conclusion that "wife" is impossible. 20 Cf. Fee's discussion (194-197) of the many instances in New Testament textual criticism where one eclectic test (e.g., usus scribendi ) may yield results that contradict those derived from another (e.g., which reading best accounts for the others?). In such examples, a "rigorist" will either follow an ad hoc rule of priorities or will resort to whim. 21 Consider, for example, Kane's treatment of such a clichéd and indifferent variant pair as ful/wel . These two adverbs occur in phrases like "And seide ful/wel softely," "wel/ful pensif in herte," "þriueþ wel/ful late," and "in a wel/ful perilous place." For all four of these examples, as well as two others, the unanimously attested B archetype reads ful . But Kane had chosen wel when editing each of these in the A version. Ignoring the impossibility of making any meaningful distinction between these two words on grounds of their intrinsic value, he managed to convince himself that ful was more emphatic than wel and thus always more likely to be scribal. Consequently, though a majority of A -version manuscripts also support ful in each of these instances, Kane chose wel as the authorial lection in that earlier edition. Therefore, when he edited B he had no choice but to veto all of these archetypal occurrences of ful . Not to have done so would have been to invite speculation about the accuracy of his judgment in editing A . There is, nonetheless, at least one instance in B where Kane and Donaldson allow ful , 6.109: "Oþere werkmen þere were þat wroʒten ful faste." Here, for some reason, Kane had chosen ful in the A version (though against 6 A mss attesting to wel ) and thus had to choose ful in B . If he hadn't found it there among the B variants, he would have been forced to conclude that B was corrupt. 22 On the other hand, if one accepts (as I do in general) the results of Hoyt Duggan's and Thorlac Turville-Petre's recent application of metrical and syntactical analysis to the editing of Middle English alliterative verse (e.g., Turville-Petre, "Editing," 155ff.; Duggan, "Alliterative Patterning," "The Shape of the B-verse," and "Notes Toward a Theory," passim ), it may be possible—in certain cases—to judge the competing claims of such tiny variants as those discussed above with some probability of success. Should Kane and Donaldson prove (by the yardstick of these newly devised criteria) to have guessed rightly more often than not, it may enhance their reputation for intuition but it can do nothing for their editorial method, whose rules are inapplicable to this level of analysis. 23 Cf. Brewer. One must, however, distinguish between variants in A manuscripts that are "authorial" because they originated (or were authorially endorsed for the first time) in Langland's B or C revisions and variants that are "authorial" because they reveal unresolved alternatives unique to the A tradition itself. The latter situation seems fairly inconsequential when compared to the problem involving variants shared with B or C , but it may, nevertheless, comprise several dozen cases. 24 An aversion to the notion of authorial variants is one of the most important threads running throughout Kane's illustrious career as an editor. First voiced in 1960 in the prolegomena to Piers Plowman A , his reluctance to concede the widespread existence of such variants—and to grapple with consequent complexities for editorial philosophy—is still apparent in two recent essays, one on the Manly-Rickert edition of the Canterbury Tales and the other on the two versions of the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women (which includes his unconvincing efforts to reclassify many variants in the Gg 4.27 text of the Legend as scribal). Yet he is hardly alone in adopting this viewpoint. In his essay on Manly and Rickert, Kane assures us that "when the author made a change he had an object in view and that it has been realized" (1989, 203); this merely restates an idealist editorial assumption traceable back to Sir Walter Greg, viz., that any authentic authorial variants will prove themselves genuine by their excellence and that the burden of proof is on their shoulders rather than the editor's: "a later variant that is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which no motive can be suggested , should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the text" (1966, 387; italics mine). Without apologizing for the inherent meliorism of this approach, one must, nonetheless, acknowledge that Greg's principle was formulated for dealing with a particular sort of problem (Elizabethan plays surviving in more than one edition) and that he explicitly excludes from its purview all cases where "complete re-writing" is involved. Unfortunately, Piers Plowman B overlaps Greg's categories since it exists as a complete rewriting of A but offers in addition many instances of isolated, minute revisions. John Bowers has proposed "hostility to authorial variants" as a defining characteristic of the entire last generation of English and American editors and sees it as a reaction against their own predecessors' credulity in such matters (445-447; cf. Hanna's evaluation of the work of George Pace on "Truth"). However that may be, authorial revision (with the resulting multiplication of "authorised" variants) constitutes a stumbling block to the theoretical framework of traditional eclecticism since it undercuts a major enabling hypothesis: the uniqueness of creative genius, for which there can never be more than one best way of phrasing a particular thought (cf. Pope, headnote). Zeller suggests that this misconception stems from a failure to appreciate the fundamentally different ways that authors and readers approach a given text: "The exegete presumes that the author's text arose not by chance but of necessity, that it is unique, unrepeatable, artistically complete, a text of maximum significance. Similarly the editor searches in the transmitted text for the one authentic text, in comparison with which all else will be textual corruption. . . . For the author on the other hand a text is something to be created by selection from the semantic inventory of the language, from the quantum of synonyms. . . . In the end the author has made a decision one way or the other, but he could have decided differently. For him creative writing does not mean necessity, but the possibility of variation" (258). 25 Ironically, Chambers and Grattan—by contrast—had decided long ago that it was essential (where possible) to establish the authorial text of B (whose author used a much better A manuscript than any now extant) before one could establish the text of A (1931, 1-2). 26 I owe this example to Schmidt, 274. 27 Cf. Pearsall, who derides the "belief in the poet as the practitioner of a divine mystery, attentive to the significance of very minute differentiation of wording" (1985, 99). While Hanna quite rightly contrasts the idiosyncratic nature of Langland's style to the purely stereotyped qualities of King Horn —in arguing that the difficilior lectio is more applicable to the former than the latter (1985, 937)—it also remains true that the compositional habits of any alliterative poet, however sophisticated, operate within a framework of stylized, formulaic, and even clichéd phrasal patterns. Many of these variations are probably attributable not to fussiness but to the author's attention having been focused at a higher semantic level than that of the individual word. Thus, even in the case of a Langland, our use of the lectio difficilior must be cautious, for this rule assumes a self-consciously bookish author (e.g., Vergil, not Homer) weighing every syllable (cf. Russell 1962, 43: "no medieval author in the alliterative tradition would have felt sufficiently strongly about the minutiae of his line structure to attempt a word-by-word check of his manuscript"). 28 Despite solemnly avowing that his purpose "is not to cast doubt upon [Athlone B 's] . . . editorial procedures," Patterson shrewdly puts his finger on this pattern of self-vindicating textual choices. He notes that when one compares A to B and C together, the latter versions appear to have corrupted A (if we accept Kane-Donaldson verbatim) at a rate of 1 mistake per 14 lines. However, when A is compared to B alone (in passages not found in C ), the rate of B corruption would appear to jump to 1 mistake per 1.3 lines! How, wonders Patterson, can one credit the apparent implication of these and other relevant figures, which would suggest that B by itself is ten times more corrupt than when it shares readings with C ? After all, when B and C alone are compared (where A has no reading), C shows a rate of superior originality that amounts to only 1 reading per 25 lines. Patterson concludes that A is thus being granted by Kane "a quite remarkable degree of originality . . ." (217, n. 52). 29 Unlike Charlotte Brewer, I incline to think the vast majority of Kane's A choices are valid and that one is not entitled to infer their wrongness there merely because they are likely to be wrong as emendations in B/C . It seems preferable to concede that revising authors do sometimes independently hit upon—and at other times simply endorse—changes, whether felicitous or merely fluid, already chosen (perhaps unconsciously) by their copyists (cf. Zeller 250-256, for examples from nineteenth-century German poetry). Pearsall implicitly concurs, noting that "An intelligent contemporary editor, with an intimate knowledge of his poet's language and idiom, may hit upon readings that seem preferable, not only to him and his modern counterpart, but that might even have been preferred by the poet himself if he had thought of them" (1985, 95). 30 In a number of cases, such as 10.142 (Kane A = [1] "dore" [2] "asid"; MS F = [1] "dore nail" [2] "aside"; B x = [1] "deeþ and" [2] "arere"), only isolated agreements with A can be detected within an F text otherwise clearly B in origin. In discussing these cases Schmidt seems more flexible than Kane but similarly reluctant to acknowledge the likelihood of micro-contamination (lateral transmission at the level of the trivial isolated phrase or even the individual word) and thus cannot bring himself to reject altogether the hypothesis of F's having occasionally been proofed against a (now lost) superior B manuscript (280). And yet B MS C 2 's having been visibly "corrected" to the A readings at 10.142—which it shares with F (cf. my discussion of the "correction" of A MS H 2 )—probably attests to the presence of such micro-contamination. Chambers and Grattan allege B 19.236-237 in suggesting that F also occasionally contaminated his copy from a C manuscript (1931, 6). 31 Notable examples of this phenomenon include those cited by Kane and Donaldson at 8.49, 8.80, 8.103, 8.112, 9.33, and 10.142. In the last two instances, I also would support an emendation based on F; nevertheless, their treatment of each of these cases makes clear that F functions for Kane and Donaldson less as a witness to authorial B than as an excuse for printing Kane A . Cf. E. C. Colwell's scathing observation concerning the practice of "rigorous" eclecticism in editing the New Testament: "Such an editor relegates the manuscripts to the role of supplier of readings" (cited in Fee 179). 32 In the authorship controversy, it was Professor Manly who appealed to a standard very like Kane's "postulate of excellence" in arguing that the man who wrote the powerfully vivid and figurative Skeat A/B Prologue lines 11-16 could not possibly have spoiled it with the drearily explicit expansion found in the analogous lines of C . More circumspect, Chambers and Grattan contented themselves with observing that "we should ourselves hesitate to say how far it is inconceivable for an author, in revision, to spoil his own work" (1931, 11). 33 Hans Zeller's approach to the editorial problem posed by such extensive authorial revisions seems astute: "for the production of a new version the source of the elements which the author uses in the text is immaterial; it does not matter whether the variants are original or extraneous, misprints . . . or variants introduced by a publisher's editor. In other words, for the elements of a text to be authoritative, and thus for the text itself to be authorised, it is not necessary to assume that the author recognised extraneous elements included in the text (compositor's errors and editorial intervention) as such; he may have regarded them as original text. The necessary condition for our establishment of text is only that he should have registered [i.e., endorsed] the readings in question (256; italics mine). Zeller goes on to observe that our judgment that the author of a revised version did, in fact, "register" its characteristic readings represents "a generalisation made on the basis of the demonstrable cases" (256). He then concludes by drawing this distinction between his own method for treating such matters and that of Greg: "we assume that the demonstrable and the undemonstrable cases are fundamentally the same; that is to say, we assume that the author took note of individual readings in the text which formed the basis of the revision. . . . The contaminating edition, however, . . . assumes rather that the [revising] author not only ignored the misprint [= scribal error] as such, but also the whole of the passage in question including wording, etc., unless the opposite can be proved; thus it is assumed that the two cases belong to two fundamentally different categories, but that the demarcation line between them coincides with the borderline between the demonstrable and the undemonstrable. I cannot imagine how one could account for this agreeable coincidence" (257). 34 Examples of defective B passages convincingly emended by Kane and Donaldson from the other two versions of Piers may easily be found in all three possible sets of circumstances, viz., from A alone (e.g., 3.36, 3.71, 6.219, 6.249, 7.164, 8.43, 9.32, 9.123, 10.109, 10.166, 10.189, 10.207, and 10.353); from C alone (e.g., Prol. 201, 2.84, 3.316, 3.341, 5.152, 5.181, 5.329, 5.508, 11.233, 11.372-373, 12.204, 13.95, 15.98, and 15.102); and from A and C in tandem (e.g., Prol. 41, 1.165, 1.200, 3.222, 3.223-224, 5.47, 5.190, 5.617, 6.26, 7.96, 7.148, 7.180, 8.22, 9.7, 9.190, 10.54, 10.176, and 10.384). 35 Kane (and before him, Chambers) was aware of this possibility but discounted it (1948, 9, n. 2). 36 For example, at B 2.10, Kane-Donaldson reads 'in' from AC , while B reads 'wiþ'. But some A and C manuscripts agree with the unanimous B lection. The same situation occurs in many other cases, viz., B Prol.217 ('bondage' AC ; 'bondemen' B ), B 1.103 ('ʒeftis' AC ; 'siluer' B ), B 2.128 ('abigge' AC ; 'abiggen it' B ), B 3.117 ('What' AC ; 'To wite what' B ), B 3.210 ('men mede' AC ; 'mede to men' B ), B 4.106 ('Lepe' AC ; 'For lope' B ), B 5.214 ('softe' AC ; 'oute' B ), B 5.220 ('beste' AC ; 'beste ale' B ), B 5.514 ('baches' AC ; 'bankes' B ), B 6.20 ('werche' AC ; 'to werche' B ), B 6.92 ('my catel' AC ; 'catel' B ), B 7.175 ('passiþ' AC ; 'passed' B ), and B 10.55 ('take' AC ; 'and taken' B ). 37 In his most recent discussion of Piers textual questions, Kane offers an illuminating, though much too brief, survey of the problem of minute scribal correction—and thus contamination—between different limbs of the same version (1988, 187-188) but seems to overlook the possibility of the same phenomenon occurring interversionally. Hanna draws our attention to the potential complexity of such problems when he notes the difficulty in deciding whether the scribe of Hm 114 corrected trivial errors in his exemplar from free guesses or an independent source (127). 38 Examples of multi-versional lections where coincidental convergence seems, to varying degrees, less likely than micro-contamination include the following ones shared by A and B alone: B Prol.36, where B x + MS H of A = 'Feynen' versus 'Fonden' of A x; B 1.103, where B x + MSS R, U, and E of A = 'siluer' versus 'ʒeftis' of A x; B 2.160, where B x + MS M of A = 'bad hem alle' versus 'alle' of A x; B 3.41, where B x + MS E of A = 'bedeman' versus 'baudekyn' of A x; B 5.126, where B x + MSS E, A, M, and H of A = 'þe beste' versus 'good' of A x; B 5.214, where B x + MSS E, A, M, and H 3 of A = 'oute' versus 'softe' of A x; B 6.16, where B x + MSS M and H 3 of A = 'comaundeþ' versus 'wile' of A x; B 7.17; where B x + MSS H, M, and K of A = 'þe heiʒe' versus 'here' of A x; and B 9.179, where B x + MSS A, M, H 3 , W, and H 2 of A = 'þe same' versus 'riʒt also' of A x. Those found in passages shared by all three versions include B 1.165, where B x + MSS E and H of A = 'bygynneþ' versus 'comsiþ' of A x/ C x; B 2.200, where B x + MSS A, M, and W of A = 'þyng' versus 'tresour' of A x/ C x; B 3.222, where B x + MS M of A = 'teche children' versus 'kenne clerkis' of Ax/ C x; B 3.223-224, where B x + MSS D, E, and M of A misdivide 323 by adding the beginning of 324 to it and MSS E and M then pad the ensuing short line with the same filler phrase used in B x; B5.190, where B x + MSS A, M, and H 3 of A (presumably contaminated in their shared ancestor since their sibling, E reads a distorted version of the same phrase) = 'eiʒen as a blynde hagge'/'eyne blynd as an hagge versus 'eiʒen' of A x/ C x; B 5.303, where B x + MSS H, N, and V of A = 'Hastow (ouʒt) in þi purs' versus 'Hast þou' of A x/ C x; B 6.5, where B x/ C x + MSS E, A, M, and H 3 of A = 'and (also) sowen (it) after' versus 'scribal omission of entire b-verse' in A x; B 10.54, where B x + MS K of A = 'a tale ouþer tweye' versus 'how two slowe þe þridde' of A x/ C x. Because no complete critical edition of C is yet available, it seems imprudent to attempt compiling a similar list of variants shared exclusively between B and C . The evidence available from materials ready to hand (i.e., Pearsall, Skeat, and Kane-Donaldson) suggests that there is comparatively little interversional contamination of C manuscripts from B . 39 Hanna believes the scribe of Hm 114 was aware of the existence of different versions of Piers : "The conflated Piers Plowman presupposes a scribe who knew that there were three versions of the poem, who knew how to recognize them with some facility, and who knew where to find copies of them" (123). The Hm 114 scribe appears to have operated within the London book trade (Doyle 41), and either he or his sponsor may, indeed, have known that the author of Piers Plowman had completely reworked the poem several times. The mere existence of Hm 114 certainly proves that, whether by chance or choice, he had his hands on copies of all three versions and carefully noted many of the differences between them, but it still seems to me unlikely that he understood them to be (as we now take for granted) distinctive authorial drafts of the poem. His conflating the three suggests instead his perception that none of his copies preserved the poem in its entirety, or, as Hanna describes it, his "awareness of deviant textual detail which needs to be concorded to produce a full and . . . acceptable text" (128). An identical motive probably accounts for the much higher incidence of contamination (both gross and micro) among the A manuscripts generally than among the B and C ones, viz., the perception that this version of the text, on account of its abbreviated and truncated appearance, lacked authoritative status and required careful corroboration (and sometimes expansion) from the longer forms. 40 I have no firm opinion on the question of whether the unique material in Bodley 851 is authorial or evinces a proto- A version of Piers . However, the statistical pattern formed by the unique B variants in this manuscript (i.e., those not witnessed by any other A manuscript while being clearly archetypal in the B tradition) is very similar to the pattern of this class of variants found in M (Society of Antiquaries MS 687), an A copy whose exemplar (as well as a more distant ancestor) appears to have been sporadically "corrected" from the B tradition. 41 Elsie Blackman raised this question concerning G more than half a century ago (513-515) but ultimately rejected contamination as a significant factor in accounting for G's peculiarities. Instead she preferred to regard all of G's trivial agreements with A as coincidental (many doubtless must be) and most of the striking ones as evincing G's partial derivation from a B exemplar superior to the common archetype of the other extant copies (she was unaware of MS H, a BA splice that sometimes shares G's eccentric readings—also, presumably, in part, through lateral transmission from the A tradition). Blackman's reluctance to conceptualize the problem as one involving intermittent contamination of G from the A version is, of course, understandable. She was accustomed to thinking of contamination as both more purposeful and larger in scale than what she detected in MS G (cf. Chambers and Grattan: "It is absurd to imagine a collator comparing his MS systematially with another one, and altering . . . trivial details quite frequently, whilst leaving untouched . . . large common blunders" [1931, 14]). Her training would have led her to expect isolated transfers of words or phrases only through memorial contamination, and that process would automatically have restricted itself to memorable linguistic units (cf. Donaldson 1955, 184, n. 17, where Blackman's view is rejected and G's actual character is attributed to correction plus memorial contamination). However, the still visible work of the H 2 corrector (and that of the Hm 114 scribe) shows that interversional collation of Piers is practicable and can be sporadic as well as systematic. Similarly, the numerous trivial "corrections" observable in B MS M (no less than those of H 2) demonstrate that a reader / corrector need not have been governed by any coherent purpose in order to alter considerably the apparent parentage of his "corrected" manuscript. Once such a copy produces progeny of its own and, in the course of time, disappears, the way is clear for someone to argue that its descendants represent a "uniquely valuable witness" to the authorial text. 42 Such behavior may seem less improbable when set beside that of the corrector(s) of MS Harley 6579 (a copy of Hilton's Scale of Perfection ). Here one version of a prose work has been cross-checked and corrected (both minutely and sporadically—most heavily in Book I) against a significantly different version of the same work. The most prolific "editor" of the Scale manuscripts, James Grenehalgh (a Carthusian monk of the late fifteenth century), is said to have made nearly 1,000 critical annotations and corrections to the text of four different copies of the work. In all, notes Michael Sargent, "The scribes and annotators of nearly one-fifth of the surviving MSS [43] seem, then, to have been aware of more than one form of the text, and to have gone out of their way to draw attention to the fact. This in itself demonstrates a degree of lateral contamination among the MSS. . . ." 43 If so, this would certainly be ironic since he has managed to replace a line whose metrical form (though rare) is attested by many other examples in the Langland corpus with one whose form (ax/ay) is unquestionably deficient. Cf. Duggan, "Notes Toward a Theory," 53-67. 44 Cf. another microscopic example long ago noted by Chambers and Grattan (1931,, 13-14), where the Hm 114 scribe "corrects" an obviously meaningless phrase in B , "by þe souþe" (5.329), by substituting A 's parallel half-line, "was red for to ryse." Unfortunately, he should have used his copy of C here, for it would have revealed to him that B x was corrupted from "þei bi souhte." 45 That is, ancestors of R/F on the one hand and N on the other might both have suffered loss of text at this point and been repaired, quite by accident, through consulting a manuscript of an alien version. In the case of N, damage to the exemplar appears less likely here than a deliberate intention to enhance this A copy with material from one of the longer versions (cf. Kane 1960, 30ff., esp. 35-36). Similar phenomena involving versional exchanges of the same brief phrases or whole sets of lines are too frequent for coincidence alone to seem a comprehensively plausible hypothesis. 46 Donaldson's observation (1955, 193) that archetypal corrections or insertions tend to remain insertions "in subsequent transcripts" seems relevant in this regard since it implies that such confusions could be perpetuated and amplified by descendant copies for several generations after the authorial foul copy had ceased to be available. 47 For purposes of this argument, it is immaterial whether one, two, or none of the variants in a particular shared set is authorial in origin. 48 Russell is more concerned with the publication history of B and C than with that of A (39-41, 45), so that one is simply left to infer that A was the earliest version publicly available: "the short and essentially incomplete A-text finds readers and copyists in numbers from the beginning" (39; cf. the more forthright, but utterly unsupported, formulation of Chambers and Grattan: "During the fifteen years intervening between the two texts [i.e., A and B ], friends and admirers no doubt copied the author's unfinished MS" [1931, 10]). Russell acknowledges (36) that A was particularly prone to contamination from the later, longer versions, but he overlooks possible implications for A 's place in the versions' sequence of appearance. As for B , the uniformity of its text and the narrow scope of its stemma lead him to postulate that, unlike A and C, B was never widely distributed and was, presumably, withdrawn from circulation almost immediately (by its author or by the authorities) on account of its radicalism and was quickly superseded by C. C , we are told, "circulated among a large number of readers without any of the disadvantages of A- or B-" (41). Nevertheless, Russell candidly concedes that this theory of C 's broader circulation and B 's early withdrawal (based on a higher number of surviving C copies?) seems contradicted by dialect evidence (cf. Samuels, 240). Seen from this perspective, the audience for C was mostly limited to "the valley of the Severn and its vicinity" (41) while A and B manifest a much wider popularity! 49 Positing extensive interversional contamination might seem to rule out any critical edition for Piers Plowman , but in actuality we are far from such an impasse—for two reasons. First, many of the effects presumably produced by this process are so trivial that one could almost never hope to distinguish them by rational criticism anyway (i.e., matters on which the only sane policy is following one's copy-text). Secondly, where it is most palpable, micro-contamination appears to move predictably in the same direction as that seen in the large-scale borrowings (i.e., from B toward the other versions, especially toward A ). What this means for the editor of A is that, when faced with variants of approximately equal merit, he should prefer those which are not present (or are less well attested) in B manuscripts. Fortunately, the broad scope of A witnesses makes it unlikely that any particular B micro-contaminant will appear in more than two genetically distinct groups of A manuscripts. In the case of B , the problem is much less acute since most of the lateral transmission is outbound rather than incoming. Even so, one must be on guard against the isolated evidence of several key manuscripts (F, G, and H) presumed to have been collated against A copies. Here one's hardest choices occur when F, G, or H offers the only satisfactory reading (a reading identical or similar to that of A ), but one seemingly incapable of accounting plausibly for the scribal production of the common B reading. 50 In his recent study of "Langland's Dialect," M. L. Samuels points to a wide dialect dispersion for the A copies, observing that "They demonstrate a situation that is found elsewhere in the history of textual criticism, in which the oldest MSS of a work (or their descendants) are found on the periphery of the culture" (238). It should, however, be noted that Samuels is not arguing for A 's precedence as the "first edition" of Piers ). He is simply invoking the "commonsense view" as a means of accounting for the striking fact that many extant copies of A appear to have originated in the geographic and cultural hinterlands. In reality, this distribution may tell us nothing about the relative antiquity of A 's circulation and evince no more than its locus of popularity. This provincial popularity, in turn, may owe much—as Ian Doyle has suggested to me—to its having filled a role as a sort of Reader's Digest condensed version of Piers Plowman , with much of the dreary exposition and hairsplitting theology left out. Such a humble function and audience may also be implied in the fact that nearly 40% of extant A copies are on paper, "while it is almost unknown for the B- or C-Texts to be written on paper" (Lyall 14). 51 That all traces of the earliest copies of Piers A should have disappeared is not without parallel. Doyle alleges the example of Richard Rolle and suggests (36-37) that early A copies may have been quickly displaced by the reading public's preference for the longer versions. Nevertheless, one is not obliged to offer any explanation for the disappearance of such materials, whose very existence is very much open to question. 52 Cf. Doyle's observation about Caxton's "business sense endorsing contemporary taste" in omitting Piers from his printing programme (36); also his conclusion that Piers "was not a leading article of commerce in the metropolis after the earlier years" of the fifteenth century (47-48). 53 I incline to agree with Chambers and Grattan that the "A-MSS. have very much the appearance of having been derived from originals which go back, if not to the author's actual autograph, at any rate to something very near it. There are passages where all the extant A-MSS. are [variously] confused or imperfect. This may sometimes be due to confusion in the author's autograph " (1931, 10; my italics and interpolation—cf. n. 48 above and related text). Chambers and Grattan proceed to contrast this state of affairs with that of the B manuscripts, all apparently descended from a carefully controlled copy full of invisible scribal errors. They fail to see, however, that this set of circumstances suggests a late release of the A autograph (Vernon, the earliest extant copy, is the only A witness to reflect a Worcestershire dialect, but it can be dated only to the 1390s) and a very informal process of publication, as compared to B . 54 The exclusive use of C to complete various A manuscripts (occurring on at least four separate occasions) is, perhaps, indicative of an early cohabitation between these two texts but may be an unrelated accident, especially since the inferior text states of W, N, and K ( A sigils), as opposed to that of the inferred T-Ch-H 2 ancestor, suggest an advanced degree of decay. Unfortunately we have no way to ascertain whether the corruptions in W, N, and K (some of which are shared with unmixed A copies) gradually accreted through the reproduction of a long series of AC parents or whether the splicings took place after most of the blatant textual error had been introduced. The mere fact that these manuscripts sometimes share errors with A manuscripts of unmixed parentage need not, as Professor Kane has often reminded us, be taken to prove common descent (and thus a late date for their splicing)—it may only demonstrate the insidious effects of convergent variation. 55 Though Kane appears not to have taken much account of this possibility in his editing of A , Chambers and Grattan were very well aware of it (i.e., "backwash of B- and C-readings upon MSS. of the A-text") and of its cause ("all the extant MSS. of the A-text are later than the B-text, and the majority are much later"). Moreover, their refutation of Mabel Day's argument for multiple authorship depends, in part, on their contention that individual readings , as well as occasional lines, from the B archetype imposed themselves randomly on isolated A manuscripts as well as on the ancestors of certain extant A families (1931, 28-40, esp. 36-37, 39). 56 Although "coincidental convergence" is incapable of accounting for a number of unexpected and striking agreements in error and, in the light of extant patterns of sporadic contamination, is unlikely to have caused as many of the trivial ones as we might otherwise have supposed, there still can be no doubt that, in thousands of cases, genetically unrelated Piers Plowman manuscripts agree by coincidence in trivial errors generated merely by their scribes having shared a common grammar and lexicon (cf. Chambers and Grattan 1931, 15-16).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Harington's Orlando Furioso : A "Spare Leafe" and a Stop-Press Correction by Simon Cauchi</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Between the xxiij th booke and the xxiiij th I would have a spare leafe . . .", wrote John Harington to his printer Richard Field in the manuscript he was preparing to be used as the printer's copy for the first (1591) edition of his translation of Orlando Furioso . 1 The remainder of the sentence is lost because the manuscript has been trimmed in binding. In the printed book, instead of a blank leaf, there is a blank opening (Q4 v -R1 r ) between the end of Book XXIII (Q4 r ) and the beginning of Book XXIV (R2 r , faced on R1 v by Plate XXIV). 2 The purpose of the request, however, is clear. Harington wished to mark a break in the text, to draw attention to what he saw as a fundamental division at the mid point of the poem. The same purpose is served by arrangements made elsewhere in the printed book. Thus, on the verso of the title-page, the "note of the matters" or contents list also divides the poem—and perhaps the book as a whole—into two parts. A line-space appears between the "first xxiij Cantos, or bookes of Orlando Furioso, ending with Orlandos falling mad" and the "other xxiij Cantos of Orlando Furioso, in which he recouered his wits"—the line-space, like the type, being in Great Primer. Similarly, the wording of the line of smaller type at the end of Book XXIII is significantly different from the wording of comparable lines at the end of other cantos. Instead of something like "The end of the annotations of the xxiij. booke", which would have been unexceptional, we read, immediately above a tailpiece towards the foot of the page: "Here end the first xxiij. bookes of Ariosto." In all three places, Harington is making the same literary point, and in order to get his point across he relies not only on words but on the suggestive power of book-design, typography, blank paper. In doing so, moreover, he was going well beyond the precedents offered him in the Italian editions. 3 Anyone concerned to understand and appreciate Harington's work on Ariosto needs to give due weight, not only to the text of the book (translation and prose apparatus), but also to the literary significances embedded by Harington, or at any rate implicit or inferable, in his book's design. 4 The approach I am advocating may be distinguished from that of another scholar who has recently been working on aspects of the "setting foorth" of Harington's Orlando Furioso . In a very interesting and provocative paper, in which he presents some findings from his collation of numerous copies of the 1591 and 1607 editions, Randall McLeod discusses the related matter of the Dedication. 5 He demonstrates quite conclusively that in the 1591 edition there was a stop-press correction in the first sentence of the Dedication, involving the removal of three words and the consequential "driving out" and rejustification of the next seven lines of type, and that the same three words in some copies of the book are deleted in pen and ink. (They are erased, not deleted, in the copy held in the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, which is one of the large-paper copies with pre-publication pen-and-ink emendations and another candidate for collation.) 6 Thus, in copies with the earlier (uncorrected) state of the Dedication, the first sentence reads: ". . . I presume to offer to your Highnes this first part of the ['part of the' deleted, erased, or left standing ] frute of the litle garden of my slender skill." However, in the printed version of his paper, McLeod does not attempt to explain the point of this textual change or to consider what it tells us about the publication history of the book or about Harington's literary intentions. He uses it instead for polemical purposes in an argument about the futility of editing and the comparative fidelity of photographic reproduction. Let me put forward an alternative (historical rather than polemical) interpretation and application of the available evidence, including the new evidence so painstakingly and helpfully gathered by McLeod. The Dedication may have been written at a time when Harington was proposing to publish Books I-XXIII of his translation separately—rather as Spenser, in 1590, had published the first three books of The Faerie Queene . If this was so, then the phrase "this first part of the frute of the litle garden of my slender skill" referred to Books I-XXIII, and implied that Harington hoped—perhaps not altogether confidently—to publish the second part, Books XXIV-XLVI, at some future date. This reading of the passage is supported by a parenthetical remark in Harington's note on the "Allegorie" at the end of Book XXIII: " Concerning Orlandos madnesse there is a notable allegorie to be gathered therof, of which (because I now haue taken upon me to go thorow with the whole worke) I will defer to speake till I come to restoring of his wit againe . . .". And there are other places in Harington's writings where he alludes to the time he spent or the difficulties he faced in translating such a long poem as Orlando Furioso . What seems to have happened was this. When he found himself able, after all, to publish the whole work in one volume in 1591, Harington (a) requested a "spare leafe" between Books XXIII and XXIV so that the two-part structure of the poem—as he saw it—would be manifest even in a single-volume publication, and (b) neglected to alter the wording of the Dedication until he saw it in proof as the book was going through the press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 British Library Additional MS 18920, fo. 90 v . Harington's instructions to the printer in this manuscript have often been examined since Sir Walter Greg first drew attention to them in 1923: see his Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 99-100. 2 That is the general rule. However, Mr Rowan Gibbs of Smith's Bookshop Limited, Wellington, has kindly allowed me to examine a copy of the second (1607) edition—item 248 in his Catalogue 93 , 1990—in which Plate XXIV appears on Q4 v and a blank leaf (R1) occurs between the plate and the beginning of Book XXIV: but other copies of the 1607 edition have the blank opening, and I know of no 1591 copy which has the blank leaf. Various indications suggest that Harington's involvement in the printing of his book was much less close in 1607 than it had been in 1591. 3 In the four Italian editions known to have been used by Harington, the division between cantos XXIII and XXIV is not differentiated in any way from the other cantodivisions. The principal design model for Harington's book, and the source of much of his information, was the Franceschi edition (Venice, 1584). This edition does have a blank leaf (u8), but it is cancelled or removed from some copies, and comes towards the end of the book, immediately after an index of first lines and before the separately signed and foliated "Osservationi . . . sopra il Furioso" of Alberto Lavezuola. 4 For a fuller discussion of these points, see my article, "The 'setting foorth' of Harington's Ariosto", Studies in Bibliography 36 (1983), 137-168, esp. pp. 164-166. 5 See "from Tranceformations in the Text of 'Orlando Furioso' ", Library Chronicle 20, nos. 1/2 (1990), 61-85. 6 The emendations described and reproduced in Randall McLeod's earlier (unpublished) paper, "Or Words to that dEffect", given at the Bowers Eightieth-Birthday Conference, Charlottesville, Virginia, in April 1985, are very similar to the corresponding ones I have examined in the Wellington copy. Where McLeod reports variant ways of making an emendation, the Wellington copy has the commoner version of it.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shared Printing, Printer's Copy, and the Text(s) of Gascoigne's A Hundredth Sundrie Flowres by Adrian Weiss *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shared printing introduced complications into the relationship between book production and textual transmission that produced bibliographical evidence of varying degrees of importance to bibliographers and textual editors. In general, two categories of shared books obtain. The first consists of the large majority of books in which the sharing operation proceeded smoothly and left no significant bibliographical evidence beyond that which demonstrates that a book was shared among two or more printers and permits the identification of one or more of the printers. 1 These two fundamental insights provide a sharper focus for bibliographical analysis in regard to the disposition of copy during production, the linkage of the book to the workmen and procedures of the respective shops and their potential effect upon the textual transmission process, and the temporal component of production. Taken alone, however, the detection of sharing does not in itself reveal anything about the temporal component of production. When supplemented by other forms of evidence accessible in most books, sharing may actually indicate an expansion of production time rather than the time-saving which it seems naturally to imply. The temporal issue usually can be settled with certainty by defining the printing context of the book in the primary printer's shop. In general, this difficult and time-consuming proposition seems unnecessary in the absence of important textual or dating problems. George Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres provides a rather unique example of a second category of shared books, in which the printing process produced bibliographical evidence relevant to unresolved textual problems. In such books, it is essential to establish the facts about the shared printing operation so as to define the temporal component of production before proceeding; otherwise bibliographical analysis must rely upon circumstantial considerations that are external to the production of the book and exhibit no necessary physical connection to the evidence found in the book. Such an approach is bound to overlook, misconstrue, or adjust the bibliographical evidence to fit a hypothesis comprised of selected external circumstances and presumptions about early printing. 2 This is especially true of A Hundreth since the book contains an unfinished text and other textual indications of time-related problems on the part of the author. A Hundreth is a quarto collating A 4 B 4 (-B1,2) C-X 4 , 2 A-Y, Aa-Hh 4 , Ii 4 (—Ii4). Pagination: 208 leaves, pp. [ 8 ] 1(=B3) . . . 36(=F4v) . . . 45(=G1) . . . [82-83 misprinted as 83-82] . . . 164(=X4v); 201(= 2 A) . . . 376(= 2 Y4v) . . . 377(=Aa1) . . . 443 (=Ii2) . . . 445(=Ii3). The significant contents are: A2-3: 'The Printer to the Reader.'; A4: title, 'SVPPOSES'; B3-K1v: text; K2: title, 'IOCASTA'; K3-X4v: text; on X4v: imprint 'Printed by Henrie Bynneman | for Richarde Smith.'; 2 A1: title, 'A discourse of the adventures | passed by Master F. I. '; 2 A1-M3: text; 2 M3v-S4v: 'The deuises of sundrie Gentlemen' [running title 2 M3v-4: ' A translation of | sundrie Gentlemen.']; 2 S4v-Ee2v: 'The deuises of master Gascoyne' [running title: 'The deuises of | sundrie Gentlemen.']; Ee2v-Hh4 v : 'Dan Bartholmew of Bathe.'; Ii1: title [for misplaced narrative link 'The Reporter'], ' This should have bin placed in the | dolorous discourse, before the Supplication | to Care in Folio. 430.'; Ii2, ' The reporters conclusion unfinished .'; Ii3: imprint, 'IMPRINTED AT LOND-| don for Richard Smith.' Two forms of typographical evidence establish the key facts about the printing of a shared book: (1) the composite of normal and variant letters that characterize a specific font at some point during its lifetime; and (2) the sequence of changes or transformations that occur in a font's composition during an extended period of usage. In this instance, analysis of the fonts found in the book permits identification of Henry Bynneman and Henry Middleton as the printers and, furthermore, reveals that the book was shared in an asymmetrical pattern created by Bynneman's recall of the shared section from Middleton. Second, although typographical evidence provided by font transformations usually is useful only for locating a shared section in a shop's production schedule, A Hundreth is extraordinary in this respect because the sequence of transformed states of Bynneman-Y1 demonstrates an expansion of production time far beyond that required to print the book even if allowance is made for several intervening book-length interruptions. Given this insight, the bibliographical and textual analysis of the book can proceed according to the certain knowledge of delayed production instead of the standard assumption of rapid printing at maximum efficiency. This understanding of the printing operation is crucial to resolving the textual problems present in A Hundreth . The extended production period during which the book was printed was adequate for major stages of textual evolution in regard to textual issues including the dates of composition and printing, modifications to the text such as revisions, deletions and omissions, changes in the author's concept of his overall collective text, and problems created by the delivery of printer's copy in segments. The recovery of Gascoigne's intention regarding the number and sequence of texts depends upon settling the issue of Gascoigne's involvement in the printing process. Whether Gascoigne intended to include the two plays in a particular location in the book has been the fundamental problem since C. T. Prouty eliminated the two plays from his edition, attributing their appearance to Bynneman's desire to enhance the book's profitability. The rearrangement of the texts in The Posies (1575), the second edition, indicates that Gascoigne was concerned with producing an overall impression by combining the separate compositions in a particular order and publishing the collective text as a single unit. An editor must determine whether Gascoigne attempted to achieve a similar effect in A Hundreth before resolving several relatively minor textual issues. This paper is intended to contribute to an awareness of the potential relationships between shared printing and textual issues. My primary focus is upon a reconstruction of the printing context of A Hundreth as the basis for interpreting the bibliographical evidence of textual evolution. I have described in previous papers the procedures to follow in establishing the essential facts about a shared book: (1) the recognition of the preliminary clues to sharing; (2) the analysis of typographical and ornamental evidence that can clarify the divisions of labor and establish the identity of one or more of the printers; (3) a survey of the primary printer's books in order to identify his section(s) of a book; (4) a survey of books printed by likely sharing candidates in the hope of identifying the sharing printer(s) and their sections. Once these facts have been established, analysis can proceed to forms of evidence which reveal the temporal component of production in the sharing situation. The subsequent reconstruction of the printing context of a shared book usually establishes the date of the printing operation, and in some instances such as A Hundreth , the printing dates of its sections. In the following discussion, textual issues will be addressed as the emerging picture of the printing operation warrants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In general, the analysis of a shared book is complicated by the justifiable inference of time-related production pressure; otherwise sharing would have been unnecessary. Two interrelated circumstances seem to underlie the sharing strategy. First, A Hundreth represented a time-consuming job with its 52 sheets. Such a long book invited sharing, particularly in a healthy business climate when intervening jobs could very likely materialize during printing. A printer would rather not tie up his press(es) for a long time on a single project with jobs appearing regularly. Similarly, preliminary negotiations for future projects could lead a printer to schedule a book with sharing in mind. Second, sharing could be undertaken to satisfy a publisher's desire for rapid printing so as to capitalize upon current but transient public interest aroused by such events as dramatic performances, notorious murders, political events, and the latest developments in the siege of Ostend. 3 In short, the sharing strategy can imply either an expansion of production time through serial printing of sections because of interruptions or a compression through a preplanned concurrent shared printing. The analysis of shared printing proceeds in several stages beginning with the discovery that a book was shared and the definition of the divisions of labor in it, followed by the attempt to identify the printers. Several forms of evidence can be used to locate the book or its sections in the production schedule of the shop(s) of the primary and/or sharing printers. Usually such evidence at least provides a relative temporal reference for the reconstruction of a printing operation. The detection of sharing is aided by the presence of preliminary "clues" at the boundary between shared sections including: (1) bibliographical anomalies or a change in setting style; (2) a shift in ornamental stock; and (3) a change in fonts. These clues provide an initial insight into the possibility that a book was shared in a particular pattern but require verification by the typographical evidence provided by font analysis. The typographical evidence can reveal further divisions within the sections indicated by the preliminary clues. Several preliminary clues suggest that A Hundreth was shared in at least two clearly defined sections. (1) The full imprint "Printed by Henrie Bynneman | for Richarde Smith." appears in X4 v (page 164) at the conclusion of Iocasta and directly preceding "Master F.I.". (2) This imprint is followed by a repeated alphabet. (3) Although the pagination is sequential, it jumps from page 164 (X4v) to 201 ( 2 A1). (4) A second partial imprint "IMPRINTED AT LON-/don for Richard Smith." appears at the end of the book on Ii3. (5) In addition, ornaments and initials appear in both apparent sections, a fact which calls for a survey of books by the printer identified in the imprint in order to establish which of the pieces he owned and hence his responsibility for the section(s) in which they appear. The five identifiable initials and one tailpiece seen in A-X can be found without difficulty in Bynneman's other books 1572-74. This evidence supports Bynneman as printer of the section. Similarly, two of the three identifiable initials in the second section (up to 2 M3v) can be found in proximate books by Henry Middleton and his partner Thomas East. 4 The identical "printer's flowers" at A3 and 2 M3 are a possible source of confusion since these cast ornaments were quite common in the period and could be misinterpreted as evidence of the same printer in both sections. The ornamental evidence clearly points to a sharing boundary at the first imprint on X4v but typographical evidence is necessary for final confirmation of the sharing pattern. (6) A second sharing division at 2 S-T is suggested by two setting features. First, the recto element of the running-titles in 2 M4-S4 is invariably "sundrie Gentlemen." Beginning with 2 T1, "sundry Gentlemen." alternates with "sundrie Gentlemen." in the pattern produced by single-skeleton imposition (i.e., "sundry" moves from 2 T1-2, "sundrie" from 2 T3-4). A preliminary analysis of running-titles working in both directions from the boundary reveals another fundamental difference: at least three skeletons were used in alternating fashion in 2 M-S with a standard measure of 86mm (except in 2 S1v,2,4v). The measure shifts to 92mm in 2 T1 and thereafter. These changes strongly imply a sharing boundary although other explanations are possible. Analysis of the fonts in A Hundreth confirms the implicit boundary at 2 S-T and reveals that the book was shared in three asymmetrical sections with Bynneman printing A-X, 2 T-Ii, and Middleton the middle section 2 A-S. A rather common problem arises from the fact that both printers used same-face pica black letter text fonts, pica italic emphasis fonts, and Guyot doublepica roman and italic for sub-titles and running-titles. Nonetheless, the evidence provided by the remaining fonts used for emphasis, headings, and quotations is unequivocal in this instance because of their uniqueness, the alternating patterns of usage, and foul-case cross contamination: (1) Bynneman's 76mm Guyot pica roman is one of two such fonts to appear in England during the sixteenth century; James Roberts used his at a much later date (1597-1605?). The Guyot is interwoven with Bynneman-Y1d in his second section (Dd-Ii) and appears in sheet A in the main title, "The contents.", "Faultes escaped.", and the cast of Supposes . (2) Bynneman-Y1 was the first Haultin Y-face to appear in England (1570?) and no other printer used the face until 1576 (Middleton began using his in about 1579). 5 Bynneman-Y1 lacked the 'fh' ligature and the 'W w', forcing an alternate setting of 'VV vv' (see later discussion); the font alternates with Bynneman-S1 in speech prefixes and sets most headings and stage directions of the two plays in B-X; and it sets the editorial links, poem titles, and emphasis words in Bynneman's second section until Dd1r where it begins alternating with the Guyot. (3) In 1573 both Bynneman and Middleton used identical 82mm S-fonts containing the crimped 'w4' variant and lacking the 'fh' ligature. 6 Both printers set 'w' and 'vv', probably a reflection of compositorial habits (also seen in their 96mm roman fonts). Bynneman-S1 alternates with Bynneman-Y1a in the speech prefixes of the two plays (B-X); stage directions are anomalously set in Bynneman-S1 in F2v, H3, P1v, and Q4, a deviation from the consistent use of Bynneman-Y1a elsewhere. (4) That neither Bynneman-S1 nor Middleton-S1 appear in the center section ( 2 A-S) is clear from the fact that this rare S-font exhibits a 79mm 20-line height, an anomaly in itself, since the bare height of the face is about 82mm. 7 The font sets the enclosed letters in "F.J." and portions of G. T.'s editorial links in "The deuises of sundrie Gentleman ( 2 M3v-S4v). Settling the ownership of the 79mm S-font is complicated by the fact that Middleton rarely used it and that John Awdeley and John Allde also possessed identical castings. In the absence of an adequate sample of Middleton-S2 in a signed, unshared book, compositorial setting habits would provide the one clue (a not very reliable one at that) to Middleton's ownership of the 79mm S-font in A Hundreth . Both Allde's and Awdeley's compositors set 'tall-s h' to supply the missing 'fh' ligature while Middleton's compositor set 'short-s h' in the same situation. Awdeley's font can be rejected after preliminary analysis because it contains sorts not seen in the "F.J." S-font (black letter colon and period, and an oversized [96mm equivalent] comma). Fortunately an extensive sample of Middleton-S2 appears in T. Three Partes STC22242 (1574) in combination with the 56mm Cornucopia-I (a2) that begins Middleton's section in A Hundreth ( 2A1). (5) Both Bynneman and Middleton used 67mm roman fonts for headings in their respective sections. Middleton's font contains a 'w' struck from an actual 'w' punch while Bynneman's 'w' was cast in a 'w' matrix formed from a side-by-side double strike with a 'v' punch. This and other minor differences distinguish the 67mm romans. (6) While no 96mm roman type appears in Middleton's section, Bynneman's 96mm font can be identified in his first section in "The Printer to the Reader." (A2-3), "The Prologue" to Supposes , Act/scene settings in the plays, and an anomalous quotation use at C1v; and in G. T.'s prose link (Ii3r) that concludes the book. The font sets both the 'vv' and a miscast oversized 'w' with crossing center stems. The typographical evidence, in short, demonstrates a division of labor in which Bynneman printed two sections of nineteen sheets (B-X) and fourteen sheets ( 2 T-Ii, A), and Middleton eighteen sheets ( 2 A-S). The sharing divisions revealed by the preliminary analysis may suggest a particular sharing strategy. In general, the division of labor seen in a shared book usually establishes the minimum time required for printing the book as defined by the largest number of sheets done by any one of the printers. Simple sharing patterns (e.g., four sections of two gatherings each, two sections of four gatherings each, etc.) such as are frequently encountered in play quartos prove nothing about production time but seem to suggest concurrent printing in the context of a deliberately planned time-saving sharing strategy. 8 However, asymmetrical sharing patterns may suggest serial rather than concurrent printing of sections in the absence of other plausible explanations for the resulting divisions of copy. 9 Markedly disproportionate sections raise doubts about the time-saving strategy and in fact may signify the primary printer's effort to offset delays caused by an interruption during which valuable production time was lost. This inference seems especially warranted if the primary printer prints the first and a later section in a book, as is the case in A Hundreth . Hence, the identification of the sharing printers as well as their respective sections is quite important in the temporal context. 10 For example, distinguishing the three sections of A Hundreth without the identification of Bynneman's type in the first and third sections would produce a reasonably symmetrical pattern with a plausible textual rationale for the divisions of copy. The first boundary (X4v) occurs at the conclusion of a self-contained text ( Iocasta ); the second boundary ( 2 S4v) yields a nearly equal number of sheets (nineteen vs. eighteen) and occurs at a point with no textual significance (i.e., within a text, but not at its end), implying that the boundary was arbitrarily chosen to produce the symmetry. This division produces a shorter third section but the added effort of dividing the book into equal sections would make no sense in terms of the overall time-saving resulting from concurrent printing by three printers and the fact that the need for accurate casting-off invited errors. On the other hand, the identification of Bynneman's type in the third section virtually eliminates concurrent printing at least in regard to his sections. The sharing pattern thus suggests either (1) concurrent printing of B-X and 2 A-S followed serially by 2 T-Ii, A; or (2) serial printing of the first two sections followed by Bynneman's recall and completion of the job. In short, the pattern produced by the identification of the sharing printers can provide circumstantial evidence of serial rather than concurrent printing and thus establish a minimum production time. However, more reliable forms of evidence are required to confirm the temporal implications of a sharing pattern. The date of printing and the production time required to print a book are essential components of a printing reconstruction that aims at settling time-related textual issues and relating the printing operation to external circumstances such as events in the author's life, literary influence according to the priority of two texts, the possible role of censorship in modification to a text, the relationship among a sequence of editions, the relation between publication vs. performance, and other similar issues. The sharing situation increases the possibility of finding timing evidence since two (or more) shops are involved. The sharing printer's books may provide the necessary evidence that is lacking in books by the primary printer. Four forms of evidence are useful for establishing the date of printing and the production time by locating a book or section(s) of a shared book in the production schedule of the shop(s) involved in its production. The results of the analysis of A Hundreth for these forms of evidence are summarized in the following paragraphs. (1) Documentary information such as entries in the Stationers' Register and dates found in prefatory materials can provide a temporal reference point. However, such dates must be verified by independent means. 11 A reconstruction often must remain relative because a concrete date cannot be established for the various points in a printing operation. At best, a sequence of dated entries in the Stationers' Register can provide a fairly certain realtime reference for inferences about the schedule of books printed during the proximate period. Unfortunately, printers' and publishers' practices varied considerably: some consistently entered their books while others did not. The problem is universal for the early part of the Elizabethan period (roughly pre-1580) before the practice of dating entries was adopted: an indication of the year of entry seems to have sufficed. Books entered during the proximate period to Bynneman, Smith, Middleton, and East follow the early practice for books actually entered, and not all were. The three imprints found in A Hundreth lack the usual annual date, but two specific dates appear in the prefatory materials. "The letter of G. T. to his very friend H.W." is dated "this tenth of August, 1572." followed by "H.W. to the Reader" bearing the date "the xx. of January, 1572[/73]." These dates will be assessed later in the context of the production schedule. (2) Progressive damage to ornamental stock is useful for locating a book in a shop's production schedule. 12 Beyond that, the recurrence of the same ornament in a sequence of gatherings or in two shared sections by the same printer usually indicates serial rather than concurrent printing because one ornament cannot be on two presses at the same time. In longer books containing many repeat appearances of ornamental stock, concurrent printing thus can be disproved for many of the sheets. Serial printing of all sheets can thus be reliably inferred given an interlocking network of recurrences. A single ornament repeats in A Hundreth but within Bynneman's first section and thus reveals nothing about the printing relation to his second section. (3) Watermark evidence found in contextual books can frequently establish a book's position in the production schedule. In certain situations, the sequence of job-lots of papers used in books during the proximate period yields watermark evidence which can distinguish between concurrent and serial printing of sections in either shared or unshared books, indicate the point at which copy was divided in shared printing, and provide an indication of delays in production. 13 Unfortunately, the papers in A Hundreth comprise a homogeneous job-lot consisting of very closely related varieties of a "cuffed-hand-pointing-at-star" from one continental source. Hence the watermark evidence is ambiguous and reveals nothing about the division of copy and whether printing was concurrent or serial. Moreover, the ambiguity extends beyond A Hundreth and obscures the location of the book in the production schedule in Bynneman's shop. This lot of related watermarks appears exclusively in at least thirteen of Bynneman's books from 1572-74 and then in The Posies . To make matters worse, several of Middleton's books also make exclusive use of the lot. 14 A high-resolution examination of one of the watermarks through the sequence of books, however, might reveal progressive states of deterioration of the mould which could be useful for dating. (4) Three kinds of typographical evidence are useful for distinguishing serial vs. concurrent printing and for dating. First, the value of an identified recurrent types survey in the temporal context is generally limited to: (1) those shared books containing two sections printed with the same font by one printer; or (2) books printed by one printer in which one of his fonts appears in sections separated by a section printed in his second (and/or third) font. 15 The movement of a group of identified types through the sequence of gatherings comprising the two shared sections demonstrates serial printing of the sections. The typographical samples of Bynneman's three pica roman fonts in A Hundreth are too small to yield recurrent types. Second, the method of imposition as revealed by the movement of running-titles can distinguish serial vs. concurrent printing. The single-skeleton method of imposition found throughout Bynneman's two sections unequivocally demonstrates serial printing. On the other hand, the fairly regular alternation of three skeletons imposed according to the single-skeleton method in Middleton's section clearly raises the possibility of concurrent printing on his three presses for most of his section. However, a few irregularities suggest that only two presses were involved. Third, typographical evidence provided by a sequence of font transformations is quite valuable in establishing the relative position of a book in a shop's production schedule. 16 This form of evidence provides the key to the reconstruction of Bynneman's shop schedule and the dating of the sections of A Hundreth .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In certain long books (such as A Hundreth ) with early and later sections printed in the same font, a sequence of font transformations can establish the relative positions of the sections in the shop schedule as defined by the respective states of the font. Bynneman-Y1 appears in a fairly large number of books in 1572-73 so that it is possible to plot the progressive contamination of the font over a period of several months. The necessary condition for transformation by fouling is met by Bynneman's simultaneous use of his three pica roman fonts during the proximate period in A Hundreth and other books. Moreover, the fonts frequently alternate within a book, a situation which invites fouling. Additionally, replenishment with new wrong-face letters produces a new state of the font. The fact that Bynneman-Y1 appears in A Hundreth as an emphasis font presents the major methodological problem since the resulting typographical sample is quite small. 17 As a general rule, the size of the typographical sample in a target book is more or less irrelevant as long as the evidence of the transformation state appears. A large sample of a font is needed only for establishing the proportions of the normal vs. foulcase letters and the expected ratio of appearances in textual units such as the page or gathering. 18 Once that probability is established, the necessary size of a sample diminishes to the level at which foul-case letters begin to appear, regardless of how many are found. Thus the very small font sample in A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres is adequate since the contaminating letters appear. On the other hand, the absence of contaminating letters in a very small sample should not be taken as proof that the font is in the early state. A font transformation in itself proves nothing about the temporal component of production unless it can be located in the shop's schedule. A stage of fouling can happen almost instantaneously in relative terms: the compositor requires only a few reaches to the wrong-font case to effect the transformation. Hence, no assumptions can be made about the amount of time required for a transformation. As will be seen below, radical transformations to a font can occur during the setting of a single page. The discovery of a transformation in progress in a given book establishes a definite temporal reference point in the shop's schedule but presents a problem of interpretation regarding the amount of time that elapsed before the appearance of the newly transformed font in the next book. In the absence of contrary evidence, it seems reasonable to assume that the printing of a short book in which a transformation occurred proceeded uninterrupted to its end. However, it is possible that a later, short book could have interrupted the printing of a long book with a large number of sheets following the transformation sheet. Since transformations occur in stages, the process can produce clear evidence of the sequence of groups of books as defined by the state of the font that appears in each group. However, the transformation evidence cannot distinguish the sequence in which the books within a group were printed. Given a group of four books, then, the target book (or section of a shared book) may be separated from the transformation book by the total number of sheets in the two other books. It also could have been printed directly after the transformation book. In short, the evidence provides only a prior terminus for the printing of a book in the shop's schedule. In some cases, extraordinary circumstances may strongly suggest that the transformation book was completed without interruption. In general, changes in a font's overall composition during its lifetime provide the evidence for distinguishing transient and permanent transformations and the sequence of states. The following analysis of the transformations of Bynneman-Y1 defines the printing context of A Hundreth in terms of the sequence of the groups of books printed during 1573. The evidence reveals an additional unsuspected division within Bynneman's second section at Cc-Dd. Pre-1573. Bynneman-Y1 . Bynneman-Y1 first(?) appeared in A dictionarie STC6832 in 1570 lacking both the 'W w' and 'fh' ligature which forced alternate settings of 'VV vv' and 'short-s h'. A few S-face 'k1' fouled the font in 1570-71 but were purged. A transient transformation in the font occurred in the setting of 'w' during 1572. Y-face 'vv' was invariably set during 1570-72 except in four books in which the compositor(s) alternated the S-face crimped 'w4' with Y-face 'vv' ( T. shippe STC5952; A Speciall STC11759; Eclogues STC22991; and An Answer Q1 STC25427, B-I). Such a restriction of contamination to a single sort or two permits distinguishing this state (1572) of Y1 from the later Y1c state (1573) where the 'w4' reappears in the context of S-face 'vv' and foul-case letters in at least eleven other sorts. The 'w4' was almost completely purged after I3 of An Answer Q1 STC25427 where the permanent transformation to Y1a occurred with the addition of S-face 'g1' while the 'w4' was still being set. A few 'w4' remained resident to produce a total of nine appearances in K-Y where the font is in the Y1a state. In addition, two appearances (D, I) of the F-hybrid short second-stem 'w' occur (from an oldface 86mm roman last used in 1570). Two remaining books bearing a 1572 imprint and containing adequate Y1a samples set exclusive Y-face 'vv' and 'g1' ( A Paraphrase STC19137.5, 27 sheets; Poeta STC19139, 27 sheets). 19 Group I. STC11635a (B-X). 21 sheets . Bynneman-Y1a appears in two books from 1573. Certaine Brief STC19060 (one sheet) seems to have been printed at this time. The setting of Y-face 'vv' is invariable in A Hundreth STC11635a (B3-X4v, twenty sheets containing Supposes and Iocasta ). Only two S-face 'g1' (F3v, L3v) and one 'fi' ligature (F3v) appear in Y1a stage directions. Despite this limited sample, it is clear that STC11635a was printed after the introduction of the S-face 'fi' ligature in 2A of An Answer Q1 STC25427. Typographically speaking, STC11635a belongs with I-2A, * 2-3v of STC19137.5 and 2E, A of STC19139 which were probably printed contemporaneously with STC25427. Group II. Bynneman-Y1b. 78 sheets . The transformed Y1b state is found in Group II consisting of five books totalling 78 sheets ( Art of Reason STC 15541, Garden STC12464, De Furoribus STC13846, Historia STC20309 and approximately A-F of An Admonition Q3 STC25429) and is characterised by mixed S- and Y-face 'vv' and 'v' settings along with an expanded foul-case cluster. The transformation into Y1b actually occurred in 2A-P, A, bc of Q1 STC25427 which was completed either prior to or immediately after Christmas vacation. The S-face 'vv' was introduced at low-density levels late (2I3v, 2L3, 2M4v, 1A2) in STC25427; the 'c f k1' and 'ct f1 fl fi fl' ligatures also entered the font at this time. The non-appearance of the 'vv' and other letters in STC11635a, 19137.5, and 19139 is consistent with their low-density in STC25427. The 'f' and 'f1 fl ct' ligatures, for example, skip one or all of the full-prose settings in 2M4v-2N1v while the 'g1' and 'fi' ligature appear in all (and in STC11635a). The expanded cluster of Y1b begins appearing late in STC15541 and STC12464, where the S-face 'd1' first appears. The limited use of Y1b in the Latin 20309 prevents S-face 'vv' settings until the Index (X-2C) and the 'f1' ligature appears by Q1; the S-face 'n3' is added in X2 and appears along with the resident 'd1 g1 vv' and 'ct f1 fl fi' ligatures. STC 20309 was probably the final book in Group II and overlapped Q3 STC 25429 A-F. Group III. Bynneman-Y1c, STC11635b ( 2 T-Cc). 127 sheets . Group III consists of seven books totalling 127 sheets ( An Answer Q3 STC25429, G-2X; Certaine Godlie STC25010; A Christian Instruction STC24788; Margarita STC23003; A Hundreth STC11365b, 2 T-Cc; An Exposition STC24171; The Supremacie STC3737, A-E2v) distinguished by the reappearance of S-face 'w4' in the context of S-face 'vv' and the expanded foul-case cluster of Y1b. STC25429 is the first book in 1573 in which Bynneman-S1 with the 'w4' alternates with Bynneman-Y1b (STC11635a required no 'w4' in the S1 settings). The extensive use of the two fonts within type-pages resulted in low-density 'w4' contamination. For example, an S1 quotation in K2:1-15 is followed by a Y1c quotation in K2:24-36 where the 'w4' appears at lines 32 and 36 and K2v:5. Moreover, the alternation increases the S-face 'vv' to new high-density levels (e.g., S-face/Y-face: 4/6, 10/7, 3/6, 9/29, 17/3, 15/12, 16/7, 19/13 etc.). In addition, a printing of STC25429 in proximity to STC25427 is suggested by the occurrence of the S-face 'k1' (STC25427: 2A3v, 2L2v; STC25429: F4, H2, M3) and F-hybrid short second-stem 'w' (STC25427, D4, I1v; STC25429, G4-4v, K2, 2E3v) only in these two books. The typographical evidence indicates that A Hundreth STC11635b (2T-Cc) was printed after STC25429. The Y1c sample in 2 T-Cc amounts to about 48 lines ("Gascoigne" appears in about half of these). The ratio of S-face 'vv' to 'w4' to Y-face 'vv' settings (18/4/22) requires that the contamination have occurred in a previous book since Bynneman-S1 was not used after STC11635a B-X. Bynneman-S1 appears along with Y1c in two books other than STC25429 in Group III but neither presented an opportunity for contamination. Y1c is limited to T2:2-18 of Certaine Godly STC25010. In A Christian STC24778, S1 is used exclusively for emphasis to Q4v followed by a Y1c stint to 2A where the S-face 'vv' and 'w4' are already at high-density levels. In short, the setting of An Answer Q3 STC25429 produced the contamination of Bynneman-Y1c as it appears in the remaining books of Group III. The introduction of S-face 'P' clearly is attributable to compositorial inconsistency in setting emphasis names in STC11635b; for example, Y1c serves this function in (repeat alphabet assumed) T2, T4, U1, U2, and U3 while the compositor turns to Bynneman-S1 in T2v, T3v, and T4v, and then sets the S1 "C[ae]sars" and "Greekes" separated by a Y1c "Menelaus" in U2v. A similar mixing occurs in Aa1-2v: the compositor set three Y-face and two S-face 'P' in Aa2 and six Y-face and one S-face 'P' in Aa2v; the latter appears in "Pencoyde" where the Y-face lower-case is used. Some of these S-face 'P' were mis-distributed into the Y1c case to reappear in STC23003 and STC 22241. An Exposition STC24171 clearly was printed simultaneously with T. Supremacie STC3737 A-E2v. The Y1c cluster appears in emphasis settings and the terminal imprint; the title imprint, however, exhibits two of the newly introduced Guyot short second-stem 'w'. Group IV. Bynneman-Y1d, STC11635c,d (Dd-Hh; Ii, A). 173 sheets . The transformation into Bynneman-Y1d occurred in the massive T. Supremacie STC3737 (153 sheets) where Bynneman-Y1c,d, -S1, and the Guyot 76mm roman alternate as emphasis and quotation fonts. Bynneman-Y1c sets S-face 'w4' and the mixed Y1c and S1 'vv' to E2v. The newly acquired Guyot short second-stem 'w' begins replacing the 'vv' in E3 and is set almost exclusively thereafter including numerous quotation settings of up to 1½ pages in length. Likewise, the newly acquired Guyot 'fh' ligature replaces the 'short-s h' settings; low-density S-face 'x2' appears as well. The importance of discovering a font transformation in progress cannot be overstated. In addition to establishing a firm point of reference in the shop schedule, the discovery provides the correct context for interpreting this kind of typographical evidence. The fact that the new Guyot 'w' appears in A Hundreth STC11635d in two Y1d poem titles in Dd1:8-10, 19-21 (seven Guyot 'w', no 'vv') followed by a Guyot 76mm roman editorial link (Dd1:28,29) could suggest that the compositor fouled the Y1d poem titles from the Guyot case while setting the page. The observed transformation in STC3737 proves that the Guyot short second-stem 'w' was already in the font in state Y1d. Therefore A Hundreth 2 Dd-Ii, A, A Briefe STC11985, and T. Closet STC7623 were printed after the transformation to Bynneman-Y1d in T. Supremacie STC3737. The final appearance as Bynneman-Y1e in T. First Part STC22241 exhibits the increasing density of the cluster as well as additional S-face letters as is typical of the final depletion of a font. It does not appear to have been used after this book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III In the absence of dates of entry in the Stationers' Register for Bynneman's books from 1573, the reconstruction of the printing context of A Hundreth and the dating of its sections must rely upon the temporal reference points established by the sequence of transformations in Bynneman-Y1 and any additional timing evidence which illuminates the production schedule. Several variables can affect the accuracy of such a reconstruction. In this instance, the survey included only those books listed in the outdated P. G. Morrison's Index of Printers and Publishers for Bynneman, Middleton, and East: the new index (Volume 3 of the revised STC ) may reveal additional books which could shift the temporal reference points somewhat. Second, some of Bynneman's output may be hidden in undetected shared sections in books by printers other than Middleton and East. However, given the identified output from Bynneman's shop, such a shift would be negligible. Third, the method of defining the temporal reference points is of necessity based upon an average weekly production rate calculated from the annual production rate. This method cannot account for the possibility of radical fluctuations in production rates from week to week due to various mechanical factors such as equipment failures and the difficulties presented by certain kinds of texts. For example, learned Latin texts probably required more time than vernacular ephemera; the outstanding quality of books such as De furoribus STC13846 and Historia STC20309 attest to this likelihood. Overall, the reconstructed schedule for 1573 seems realistic and, furthermore, the reference points for the sections of A Hundreth could vary considerably without affecting our understanding of the textual problems. The identified total annual production of 466 sheets in 1573 is comprised of the 434 sheets in books containing Bynneman-Y1 and an additional 32 sheets in four other books. An average weekly production rate of 9.3 sheets per week is calculated on the basis of fifty working weeks per year (one week holidays at Christmas and Easter). This weekly average yields an average of 1.55 sheets per day (approximately 300 working days per year), a figure which reasonably approximates the output to be expected from a three-press shop over the long term. 20 The following assignment of specific reference points is necessary for the sake of argument and overlooks the reality of weekly variations in production and the possibility that part or all of Q2 STC25428 was printed in January 1573. The thirty-two sheets in books not containing Bynneman-Y1 have arbitrarily been placed at year's end: thus the reference points could be early by as much as 3.4 weeks. Group I. Bynneman-Y1a, STC11635a . The printing of the twenty-one sheets of Group I, including A Hundreth STC11635a, required a minimum of two weeks. Two factors suggest that Group I extended into early February. Bibliographical evidence suggests that the printing of A Hundreth STC 11635a (B-X) was interrupted at least once, and probably twice, resulting in minor delays which are negligible in regard to overall production time and the issue of textual evolution. The fact that the pagination error between F4v (page 36) and G1 (page 45) dropped eight page numbers (37-44), or one gathering, suggests a calculation error of the kind that could be expected following the interruption by an intervening job. A compositorial misimposition of signatures and/or page numbers from the last-distributed forme presumes a serial distribution followed by imposition and is easily detected because the error usually affects only the sequence of signatures and/or page numbers. 21 However, the error at pages 36-45 cannot have occurred through such a mis-imposition of numbers salvaged from either previous forme. In fact, this process was more likely to eliminate the error since a goodly supply of "3" and possibly a "9" (from "29" in the outer forme) would have been on the stone, requiring only a new "7 8" to complete the decade. A return to A Hundreth after an intervening job produces a different situation. Foremost is the fact that all type would have been distributed, thereby eliminating any erroneous transfer of page numbers. Second, the perfected sheet F would have been removed to the warehouse. Third, copy would have been marked to indicate that sheet G was the next to be set. However, the compositor's mark consisted only of the typical elongated bracket or slash followed by a marginal notation "G" or "G1". 22 The marking of page numbers was irrelevant in copy set seriatim for single-skeleton imposition; the error proves that no page number was marked. Given standard shop practice for a manuscript containing a title and preliminaries, the compositor would assume that the play-text began on A3r which would be assigned page number 1, resulting in a four-page negative offset for the calculation. F would then be the sixth sheet running to page 48 less the offset of four pages, or page 44. Sheet G thus began with page number 45. In short, the pagination error occurred because the compositor assumed that the text began in sheet A rather than B. The evidence of an interruption between sheets E and F is less certain. First, the furniture of the skeleton surrounding the running-titles underwent some modification with the result that the relationship between the running-titles of the inner and outer formes shifted laterally about five letters from the previously accurate registration. Second, Bynneman-S1 was fouled extensively in the speech prefixes of B-E with Bynneman-Y1a 'E P' and Guyot 'C D'. The frequency of these foul-case letters drops radically in sheet F and after (for example, all fourteen 'D' in sheet G are correct-face). The Y1a and Guyot capitals seem to have been purged at a single time following sheet E rather than during the distribution of each previous fouled forme; if so, a slight interruption probably resulted, given the difficulty of the task of purging wrong-face roman capitals. The single-skeleton method of imposition in use in B-X points to a single compositor who could not simultaneously attend to composition and purging: an interruption was thus a necessary condition for the latter. 23 Group II. Bynneman-Y1b (running total: 99 sheets) . The seventy-eight sheets of Group II required about 8.4 weeks for printing prior to the transformation to Y1c in STC25429. The two learned Latin texts ( Historia STC 20309, 28 sheets; De Furoribus STC13845-46, 14 sheets) printed in this group probably extended printing time beyond the fourth week of March and into April. Group III. Bynneman-Y1c, STC11635b (running total: 226 sheets) . A combination of factors suggests that STC11635b was printed in late May at the earliest. The regular alternation of three skeletons imposed according to the single skeleton method indicates that the printing of STC25429 G- 2 X proceeded without interruption into the second or third week of May, given 4.6 weeks for its forty-three sheets plus Easter week vacation. The typographical evidence noted above is complemented by the circumstances of publication. The royal furor caused by the surreptitious publication of An Admonition to Parliament Q1-2 STC10847-48 in June-August 1572 and A Second Admonition STC4713 in mid-November finally culminated in the Queen's Proclamation of 11 June 1573 after an unsuccessful year-long attempt to ferret out the secret Puritan press and suppress the books. An early reprinting of An Answer is understandable given the market situation created by the high-profile Admonitionist controversy. 24 Bynneman simply would not have interrupted the printing of Q3 STC25429 G-2X to continue work on A Hundreth and, in fact, gave STC11635 2 A-S to Middleton in order to avoid an interruption of some book. The sharing of A Hundreth could also have been occasioned by two other longer books of Group III (STC25010, 21 sheets; STC24788, 33 sheets). Overall, the printing of Group III extended about 25.3 weeks in 1573, or through the second week of July. Group IV. Bynneman-Y1d, STC11635c,d . The printing of the 173 sheets of Group IV following the transformation to Bynneman-Y1d in T. Supremacie STC3737 extended from mid-July through the first week of November. No evidence is present to indicate when the remaining seven sheets of A Hundreth (Dd-Ii, A) were printed during this period, but they represented a minimal interruption in the printing of T. Supremacie STC3737 and probably were worked off when copy arrived, given the knowledge that early printers frequently worked on more than one book during a period in order to maintain an overall work flow. Long books such as STC3737 were of necessity susceptible to interruptions by short jobs of several sheets (such as Dd-Ii, A) which would be treated as single units of production. STC3737 very probably began printing before copy for STC11635c,d arrived; common sense suggests that Bynneman would have simply printed off the remainder of A Hundreth rather than beginning T. Supremacie if remaining copy for the former was in hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The reconstruction of the production schedule demonstrates that the printing of A Hundreth extended through at least eight months with long delays between Bynneman's three sections (B-X, 2 T-Cc, 2 Dd-Ii, A) as distinguished by the transformations in Bynneman-Y1 and the times required for printing the intervening books. In general, delays raise an obvious question about the temporal relationship between the delivery of printer's copy and the printing of the sections of a book. Although presswork ultimately defined the rate of production, the delivery of copy was an overriding factor since printing could only proceed with copy in hand. Hence, no problem occurred if all copy was delivered at the commencement of printing or if parts of copy arrived before copy was exhausted. A delay in printing thus may indicate belated delivery of copy in segments. A second factor must also be recognised. Even if completed segments of printer's copy for A Hundreth were in hand from the start, the assortment of vain ephemera represented by the texts of A Hundreth could easily have been set aside, if occasion demanded, to make way for high-priority theological, political, historical, and learned texts such as were printed during the eight-month period. Three temporal components related to printer's copy must be defined in the context of the sharing situation: (1) when the division of copy occurred in the primary printer's production schedule; (2) whether the shared sections were printed serially or concurrently; and (3), whether the resort to sharing points to a preplanned time-saving strategy. The transformation evidence absolutely eliminates the possibility that Bynneman's three sections were printed concurrently. However, since concurrent shared printing obviously requires that completed copy be in-hand for casting-off, division, and transportation, the printing location of Middleton's section 2 A-S is the critical issue in the overall relationship between printer's copy and the evolution of Gascoigne's sequence of texts. If Bynneman actually divided copy after sheet B, producing nearly equal sections of nineteen and eighteen sheets and the distinct possibility of concurrent printing from completed printer's copy of the two plays, "F.J.", and "The Devises", these texts had to have been composed, revised, and fair-copied by early February, and nearly so by the fictitious date "xx January 1572[/73]." Since typographical and watermark evidence for dating Middleton's section is lacking, it is necessary to generate a circumstantial case by interpreting relevant bibliographical evidence in the context of the sharing situation represented by the production of Groups I-III. In general, a section in a shared book must be analysed (1) as a unit of production in itself, and (2) as a sub-unit of the shared book as a whole in an attempt to identify the probable factors which led to the sharing strategy. Several considerations eliminate any likelihood that Middleton's section 2 A-S was printed during Group I along with STC11635a. First, the absence of internal bibliographical and textual anomalies reveals that Bynneman's first section, containing the texts of Supposes and Iocasta , was treated as a single production unit printed from manuscript fair copies. Both texts were in a final, stable state since no significant revisions or modifications (except for a very few changes in words) are found in the second edition. Furthermore, the extant manuscript copy of Iocasta agrees almost exactly with the text found in A Hundreth and pre-dates the printing of the book. 25 Gascoigne inserted the date "1566" and the identification "of Grayes Inn Esquire" into the titles of the texts in The Posies , details which correspond to known facts about this period of his life. Second, the interruption of printing at F-G (and possibly E-F) bears no relationship either to internal textual divisions or to a probable sharing situation. Moreover, the transition between the two texts at K1v-K2 is perfectly normal: printer's copy presented no difficulty to the compositor. Third, running-title analysis reveals that the single-skeleton method of imposition was employed throughout Bynneman's sections of the book. Given his three presses, Bynneman's choice of this slowest method of production is definite evidence that he saw no need for haste in printing the twenty-sheet unit either before or after the interruption at F-G. In short, the printing of B-X proceeded normally despite the interruption. Hence it is impossible to argue for the sharing of A Hundreth 2 A-S during the printing of B-X. In contrast, Bynneman's employment of the sharing strategy is very plausible in terms of the production circumstances of Group III. The sharing strategy was primarily motivated by the delivery of copy rather than the usual time-related factors. First, the division of copy into Middleton's section 2 A-S and Bynneman's section 2 T-Cc indicates serial rather than concurrent printing of the sections. The conclusion of the "F.J." narrative in 2 M3 presented a perfectly logical textual boundary for the division of copy into nearly equal segments for concurrent shared printing: the maximum time-saving would result from sections of twelve and thirteen sheets ( 2 A-M, N-Cc). Hence, the sharing was not based upon a preplanned, time-saving strategy since the actual division produced sections of eighteen and seven sheets. Second, the possibility that the sharing was intended to offset lost production time can also be rejected. At least two months passed between the printing of STC11635a and the transformation into Bynneman-Y1c. The sharing of 2 A-S could in no way compensate for this amount of time. Nor is it reasonable to assume that Bynneman would tolerate a two-month delay before deciding to share a book in order to avoid a further delay of about eighteen days if he actually had copy in hand all the while. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Middleton was unable to take on the shared section during this two-month period given the output from his shop in 1573. Similarly, Bynneman printed only seven sheets ( 2 T-Cc) before once again interrupting the job for as much as two more months. Since only seven sheets remained to complete the text ( 2 Dd-Ii, A), it stands to reason that, having already resorted to sharing, Bynneman would have passed the remaining copy to Middleton if he had it in hand. Third, the virtual certainty that the printing of An Answer Q3 STC25429 took precedence over A Hundreth corresponds to the time-related pressure of the classic sharing situation. In short, the evidence indicates clearly that Middleton's section was printed during Group III along with STC11635b. The delays in printing resulted from the staggered delivery of printer's copy in segments in late January and mid-May. Taken alone, this fact very strongly implies that the composition of "F.J." and "The devises" occupied Gascoigne during most of the intervening period since the preparation of printer's copy required a week or two at the most. The probability that composition delayed the delivery of copy and printing is further suggested by evidence that these two texts were delivered in separate manuscript segments. In general, setting from such copy could cause compositorial confusion about the appropriate setting style and thus produce anomalies at the junction of contiguous sections of copy. The potential significance of graphic layout and typographical conventions as evidence of compositorial interpretation of copy has not received much attention although bibliographers are familiar with these matters. The setting anomalies at the junction of manuscripts containing "F.J." and "The devises" are identifiable in the context of the shop practice of employing (1) a hierarchical titling convention to graphically indicate the relationships among sub-texts in a book, and (2) a particular setting format to mark the end of such a textual unit. Graphic conventions vary according to format. 26 In quarto settings, the main titles of independent texts such as Supposes, Iocasta , and A Hundreth are set in 7mm roman capitals and/or lower-case, with additional lines of title text set in smaller sizes of type in descending order, ending usually with the pica roman in the imprint. Preliminaries (e.g., "The Printer to the Reader"), components (e.g., " The Prologue or argument ", " Epilogue ") and sections of the text are headed by sub-titles in either roman or italic (compositorial preference) double-pica (5mm capitals). The running-titles are usually set in double-pica but sometimes in pica; however, the same size of type is used consistently in the running-titles throughout a book. Two significant titling anomalies occur in A Hundreth 2 A-Ii which indicate junctions of segments of manuscript copy. According to "The Contents," A Hundreth contains four textual sections linked together by G. T.'s editorial frame, which presented a titling difficulty: once the text began with the double-pica sub-title "A discourse of the aduentures | passed by Master F. I. " in 2 A1, the continuous flow of G. T.'s editorial commentary between sections eliminated the opportunity to insert double-pica sub-titles for the remaining sections: "The devises of sundry Gentlemen," "certayne excellent devises of Master Gascoyne," and "Dan Bartholmew." Therefore the shift in textual sections could only be indicated by a shift to the appropriate new running-title. This occurred except for "devises of Master Gascoyne" and "The Reporter" (see later discussion). As a basis of comparison for the following analysis, the normal setting format for transitions between sections of the text in a continuous manuscript linked by G. T.'s editorial frame can be seen in Ee2v ("devises of Master Gascoyne" to "Dan Bartholmew"). G. T.'s link between "F.J." and "The devises" unequivocally implies continuous copy with a transition directly to the Ariosto translation: "I will begin with this translation as followeth." However, the compositor's end-of-text setting of this link is extremely improbable for continuous unbroken manuscript copy which included "The devises" as well as "F.J." The link is about evenly divided between 2 M2v-3 (292-293) and if set at full measure, the carry-over text would occupy a third of the page. After the first ten lines on M3, the compositor narrowed the measure with each successive line and centered the lines so that the text converged in a "V" to a final line 20mm in width (see Prouty's setting); the " G.T. " signature occurs at mid-page. He then vertically centered a rectangular setting of printer's flowers measuring approximately 26mm x 52mm between the " G.T. " and the signature and catchword. In terms of standard practice for prose texts in Middleton's shop (and Bynneman's as well), this setting format is reserved for the end of an independent text or a sub-text with no textual relationship to the subsequent text. 27 It is unlikely that the compositor was responsible for the insertion of the flowers at this point. Such layout details probably were marked in copy by the printer. In one rare manuscript, the printer Richard Field marked the copy of Sir John Harrington's Orlando Furioso to instruct the compositor to insert an ornament at the transition between sub-texts but failed to mark a page-break. The compositor's treatment of the transition is illuminating in the present context. Harrington's instruction reads: "I would have [yow?] immedyately in the next page after the fynyshinge of this last booke, with some prety knotte. to set down the tytle, and a peece of the Allegory as followeth in this next page." In other words, Field should graphically indicate the end of "this last booke" by leaving the rest of the page blank (as he had been instructed and had complied at an earlier textual division), beginning the "Allegory" on the next page with an ornament over the sub-title, followed by text for the remainder of the new page. It seems clear that setting from the continuous copy influenced the compositor to duplicate with a continuous setting of "this laste booke," the "prety knotte.", the sub-title, and text on the same page. 28 Similarly, Middleton's compositor duplicated his physical copy by using the end-of-text format and shifting to a new page. His misinterpretation of the transition clearly points to setting from a new manuscript headed not by a sectional sub-title, but by the title of the first poem. Rather than adopting one of the three formats used thereafter in setting titles of poems, he set the first poem title as a section sub-title. 29 The first line of " A translation of | Ariosto allegorized " appears in double-pica italic on the running-title line of 2 M3v (the second line in pica italic) along with page number "294" in double-pica roman. The choice of double-pica italic was dictated by the practice which distinguished a sub-title from a running-title: for example, the sub-title " Epilogue " is italicised in X4 but appears in roman as the running-title in X4v. Further, the running-title appropriately shifts to "sundrie Gentlemen." in facing recto 2 M4 with the new first element "The deuises of" in verso 2 M4v. (Interestingly enough, " A translation of | sundrie Gentlemen." would probably make sufficient sense to a compositor's or corrector's eye to let pass.) He then began the poem with a small 10mm 'W' used frequently by Middleton to head sub-sections of texts. It is essential to recognise that the compositor had both manuscripts in hand and set seriatim at this point. Having solved the transition problem, he then set an entirely unique double-pica italic signature " M.iii " and catchword " swash-A " from the case which supplied the sub-title at the top of 2 M3v. This is the only possible explanation since the case had not been used since the beginning of "F.J." in 2 A1. In short, the transitional link's implication of continuous manuscript copy is simply unacceptable in view of the end-of-text setting anomaly and the triply anomalous treatment of the beginning of "The deuises" (the double-pica sub-title itself, the use of the title of the poem as the sub-title, and the insertion of the ornamented initial). Overall, it seems likely that Middleton was given the two manuscripts without any explanation of their textual relationship. He and the compositor were left to their own ingenuity in resolving the puzzle presented at the junction of the manuscripts. Bynneman's compositor responded similarly at the junction between the manuscripts containing "Dan Bartholmew" and the correction notice for insertion of the misplaced editorial link. Two setting features at the end of this text in Hh4v clearly imply an end of the "Dan" manuscript: a rectangular tail-piece (9mm x 43mm) fills the empty space (lines 26-35) and no catchword appears. The absence of a catchword for Ii1 indicates that Hh was printed before the final manuscript arrived: otherwise the catchword would have been included as a matter of course. The considerable amount of space remaining in Hh4v could easily have accommodated the correction notice set in pica roman (as it should have been) and several lines of the first stanza of the misplaced editorial link. That Bynneman expected more material is clear from the absence of an end-of-book imprint. Moreover, the manuscript sheet headed by the correction notice was interpreted by the compositor as a new text and not as a sub-section of "Dan Bartholmew". First, the running-title changes to "The Reporter.", corresponding to the entry "Last of all the reporter." (without page reference) in "The contents". Had the compositor (or corrector) checked against the printed sheet where the correction notice locates the misplaced editorial link, the correct running-title "Dan Bartholmew | of Bathe." would have been used. Second, the correction notice itself rather than "The Reporter." is set in Ii1r as a sub-title. " This should have bin placed in the " appears in double-pica italic on the running-title line (with page "441"), followed by a line in 96mm roman and then a line in pica roman. The actual sub-title of the misplaced narrative link ("The Reporter.") is set normally in the Guyot pica roman and probably was the source of the running title in Ii1v, Ii2v-3. " The reporters conclusion unfinished ." likewise is set in double-pica italic on the running-title line of Ii2 and the correct catchword appears in Ii1v, indicating that copy was in-hand. (The absence of a page reference in "The contents" is perhaps attributable to the fact that no page number appears alongside the " conclusion unfinished .": whoever supplied page references probably searched for a doublepica sub-title corresponding to that in "The contents", so the page number 441 in Ii1 alongside the correction notice was irrelevant.) The setting of the two headings strongly suggests separate manuscript sheets rather than a single (probably) bifolium containing both texts. The final link is set in 96mm roman (a concluding flourish) in the "V" format, followed by the " FINIS " and the end-of-book imprint. Given the fact that two compositors in different shops mis-interpreted the beginning of separate manuscript segments in the same manner, it seems likely that Gascoigne's style of heading a new manuscript or new sheet was the common source of compositorial confusion. A variety of factors suggests possible manuscript divisions at four other points. (1) The delay in printing evidenced by the shift from Bynneman-Y1c in Cc4v to Y1d in Dd1r implies segmented copy although no unquestionable setting anomalies occur. The text in Cc4v ends with the first line of the third stanza of poem No. 72; copy for the remainder of Nos. 72-73 that was carried to Dd1r was in hand so that the correct catchword ("If") could be set. However, the transformation evidence categorically excludes the possibility that the letterpress for Dd1r was set and left standing at the time Cc was printed. A minor anomaly occurs. The compositor set the final "poem" (a single line, not given a number by Prouty) following No. 73, "Quoniam etiam humiliatos; am[oe]na | delectant", in 96mm roman type. The turn-under was unnecessary and "delectant" is atypically off-centered to the left. The significance of this setting must remain a matter of opinion. The standard practice of setting foreign language quotations in emphasis type called for a shift from black letter, and given the pica roman links before and after the "poem," the only logical option was pica italic. If, however, the Latin quotation ended a manuscript, a compositor might be tempted to shift to the larger font size (as in the concluding editorial link). Further, it seems likely that the Latin verse marks the end of this compositor's stint. The titles for Nos. 72-73 are set in Bynneman-Y1d while the title of "Gascoignes voyage into Hollande " initiates the use of the Guyot 76mm pica in A Hundreth ; it is used in the rest of the book for emphasis, poem titles, and editorial links except for a Y1d stint at Ff2v-Hh2v. Overall, the botched setting and the shift in poem title fonts suggest that the first compositor finished the copy carried over from Cc4v, but a second compositor was given the new manuscript and set to Ff2v. (2) The absence of anomalies at the transition to "Dan Bartholmew" (Ee2v:8) suggests continuous copy extending from "Gascoynes voyage" (Dd1) to the end of "Dan" in Hh4v. The 76mm Guyot transitional narrative link in Ee2v is set normally with diminishing line lengths, and the running-title correctly shifts to "Dan Bartholmew | of Bathe.". (3) Several factors raise suspicions of a manuscript junction at 2 S-T but the evidence is ambiguous. First, the editorial source of the text and location for new running-titles is unclear. "The contents" indicates that a new subtext "certayne deuises of master Gascoyne" begins in S4v (repeat alphabet assumed) but the running-title is unchanged, the only such anomaly in the book. The transitional link begins "I will now deliuer vnto you so many more of Master Gascoignes Poems," an obvious source of a new recto element for T1. However, Middleton's compositor set the transitional link and the first twelve lines of "Gascoigns Anatomie" before Bynneman's compositor continued setting on T1. The oversight seems more probable if two separate manuscripts passed at different times between Bynneman and Middleton. Conversely, it seems more likely that Smith or Bynneman would have indicated the new recto element if copy was continuous, provided that the "so many more of" in the link was not confusing. Second, the movement of running titles into sheet S reveals that the moderate irregularity obtaining in M-R degenerated into chaos. It is clear that outer-S was the last forme to be imposed, and somewhat later than would be expected. However, the need to adapt or construct a skeleton to accommodate the very long lines in the texts of S1v-2,4v is as plausible an explanation for the apparent slow-down in presswork as the late delivery of copy for "the deuises of Master Gascoyne." Finally, the fact that Bynneman recalled copy at this point may be a mere coincidence. All things considered, the evidence leans toward inferring that the slow-down in imposing sheet S after the quite regular machining of A-M and the general regularity of M-R indicates the compositor's recognition that he was approaching the end of in-hand copy which would have lacked material for about half of the final page S4v. 30 (4) Finally, a major textual omission occurs in 2 Y3 (373). The sub-title of "Gascoignes De profundis " (No. 65) appears at the bottom of 2 Y2v (not anomalous, see 2 O2v, P2v, R1v) along with the catchword for the editorial link in 2 Y3 instead of the psalm: the sonnet which introduces the psalm follows the link. The link begins "The occasion of the vvrighting hereof . . ." in the editor's standard reflexive mode of commenting upon the previous composition. Compositorial omission can be ruled out: the setting sequence of prose editorial link, poem title, then another prose editorial link is an inherent contradiction to a compositor who has been interpreting copy for shifts from 67mm roman in the links to pica roman poem titles to black letter poem texts. Moreover, 2 Y2v-3 would have been set seriatim regardless of the overall method of setting. The setting format for the links is normal as well. In short, the only reasonable conclusion is that the psalm was not in the manuscript copy and, moreover, the omission is not attributable to a manuscript junction. Prouty's collational data ("Critical Notes," pp. 277-290) reveal a dramatic rise at this point in errors later corrected in The Posies that clearly points to a deterioration in the quality of printer's copy. According to the chronological sequence of the poems detected by Prouty, a chronological division occurs here: Nos. 66-67 can be assigned to early 1572 prior to Gascoigne's first departure to Holland in May 1572. It seems likely that the omission and subsequent errors are attributable to Gascoigne's attempt to compose the links and to revise the recent poems during the faircopying process. In summary, the bibliographical evidence reveals that copy was delivered to Bynneman in at least six separate manuscript segments: (1) Supposes (B3-K1v), (2) Iocasta (K2-X4v), (3) "The adventures of Master F.I." ( 2 A-M3), (4) "The devises" ( 2 M3v-Dd1r) (5) "Gascoignes voyage" and "Dan Bartholmew" ( 2 Dd1-Hh4v), (6) and the misplaced narrative link ( 2 Ii1-1v); two additional sub-divisions are possible: (7) the "devises of Master Gascoyne" ( 2 S4v-Cc4v), and (8) " The reporters conclusion unfinished " ( 2 Ii2-3). The fact that the manuscript junctions, as indicated by the bibliographical evidence, correspond exactly to textual divisions cannot be attributed to mere coincidence. When placed in the context of the long delays between sections and the minimum production time of eight months, the segmentation of printer's copy clearly indicates that the composition of the editorial frame and the "F.J." narrative, and the organization of previously written materials into the editorial frame, occurred during the January-August period after Smith undertook the publication project. Thus the date affixed to G. T.'s letter, "this tenth of August, 1572", is a component of the fiction of surreptitious publication created in the preliminaries of "The adventures of Master F.I." and "The Printer to the Reader". It is intended to allow for a credible passage of time for H. W. to have decided upon publication, produced a faircopy for the printer, made arrangements with the fictitious publisher "A.B.", and gotten the project underway by "the xx. of January.1572[/73]". Six months is far more time than would have been required, so this date must be explained otherwise. The date is fictional in the sense that Gascoigne had not yet composed either "F.J." or H. W.'s letter. Hence, it seems clear that Gascoigne picked this specific date because, as the reconstruction demonstrates, the project probably began shortly afterwards. Similarly, the various references to printer's copy as "this written booke" (50:42), "this written regyster" (220), "the originall copie" (51:7), "the first coppie hereof" (47:10), and "this recorde" (48:7), as well as the illusion of a single continuous manuscript sustained in G.T.'s editorial frame, are purely fictional. 31</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V It is necessary at this point to broaden the scope of this discussion to an examination of the combinations of bibliographical and textual evidence which demonstrate that Gascoigne neither was involved in the printing of the book nor saw any printed sheets. Thus Gascoigne's absence during the entire printing operation is the key to perceiving the relationships between the sharing situation and the bibliographical facts produced by the piecemeal evolution of the texts and the modifications in Gascoigne's overall plan for the book during the eight-month period. There can be no doubt that the texts evolved given the most remarkable insight provided by the printing reconstruction: that Gascoigne failed to complete one sub-text despite the minimum printing time of eight months. In the final editorial link, G. T. notes that he had "not recovered a full ende of this discourse" in reference to "The reporter's conclusion vnfinished.". This is clearly not a fiction. The completed version in The Posies added fifty-four stanzas to the original ten. Gascoigne, in short, had planned a considerably longer concluding link for "The Reporter" but abandoned it after just beginning its composition or the revision of an existing draft. Other internal textual evidence of the aborted plan for "Dan" is present. Beyond that, the failure to complete "Dan" probably is the reason for the modification of the original plan to include it as an independent sub-text. This late modification produced four major anomalies: (1) the cancellation of B1-2; (2) the anomalous imprint in page 164; (3) the pagination gap between pages 164-201; and (4) the separation of "The Printer to the Reader." from the text of "F.J." The evidence of Gascoigne's absence follows. (1) The pre-textual materials of A Hundreth contain statements that are equivalent to components of a bibliographical description. Two fundamental discrepancies occur which categorically exclude the possibility that Gascoigne examined either the printed sheets or the completed book. Circumstantial evidence is provided by the only known fact regarding Gascoigne's whereabouts during the period: a record of his attachment to an English regiment in Holland by 25 May 1573. First, the belated delivery of copy of "The Printer to the Reader," probably along with the "F.J." manuscript in mid-May or thereafter, doubtlessly produced the displacement of the letter from its intended position directly preceding the letters of H. W. and G. T. The "printer" begins in A2:7 (unpaginated): "Master H.W. in the beginning of this worke, hath in his letter (written to the readers) cunningly discharged himselfe of any such misliking . . ." (47:6-7). H. W.'s letter actually appears in 2 A1-1v (page 201). The "printer" obviously is a fictional character with a role in the surreptitious publication subterfuge. Equally obvious is the fact that Bynneman did not write the letter. As printer, he definitely was responsible for organizing and overseeing the printing of the sequence of texts and probably responsible for supplying page numbers for "The contents" by matching sub-titles with the pagination found in the printed sheets. The sub-title in "The contents" as printed reads: "Thirdly, a pleasant discourse of the adventures of master F.I. . . . 201." Furthermore, the "printer" claims that "hauing wel perused the worke, I find nothing therein amisse" (47:20-21). Bynneman did not write the letter, but simply printed it in its proper location as called for by its title: at the beginning of the book despite its undeniable connection to the text on page 201. Bynneman would have put it in sheet A regardless of where it appeared in copy. The letter therefore reveals two components of authorial intention. Gascoigne intended that "The adventures of master F.J." appear first in the book. Moreover, his references in the letter to Supposes and Iocasta leave absolutely no doubt that the two plays were to be printed along with "F.J." but after it. In short, Gascoigne wrote the letter in the mistaken belief that his directions for the sequence of texts had been implemented by Smith and Bynneman. Although title pages are notoriously untrustworthy in regard to descriptive materials which appear beneath the main title, this title page confirms the statements of the letter. The main title is A Hundreth sun-|drie Flowres bounde | up in one small Poesie , corresponding to the title contrived in "H. VV. to the Reader." to refer to the collection of four sub-texts commencing with "F.J." "F.J." therefore must appear first in the book (I know of no exception to this rule). Moreover, specific reference is made to translations of Euripides and Ariosto: Euripides' only contribution is Iocasta ; the reference to Ariosto is very probably to Supposes although the short translation of the allegory also appears at 2 M3v. The title page references to translations by Ovid and Petrarch present an unresolvable crux but may indicate that at some point Gascoigne planned to add these texts to the book. Second, the correction notice heading the misplaced narrative link in Ii1 was written by Gascoigne, but someone with access to the printed sheets provided the page reference "in Folio. 430." The notice is quite specific as to the proper textual location for the insertion of the link (" in the dolorous discourse" and " before the Supplication to Care." [my emphasis]) but would be ambiguous to either Smith or Bynneman. The misplaced link appears in The Posies at a location corresponding to page 420 in A Hundreth where it makes textual sense. Memorial confusion on Gascoigne's part probably led to the ambiguity of his confusing reference to the intended textual location. 32 (2) In general, a repeated alphabet and/or pagination at a sharing boundary is an expedient solution to the problem of joining two shared sections without restrictions imposed by printing sequence and textual length. The two sections can be printed in any sequence and the first section can be extended indefinitely without causing confusion as to the order of texts, which is then established by the binding sequence. The flexibility is due to the absence of a sequential alphabet and/or pagination that locks the two sections into a defined order. Although the alphabet repeats in Middleton's section of A Hundreth , the pagination does not. Rather, Bynneman's first section B-X concludes at page 164 and Middleton's section begins at 2 A1 with page number 201. Bynneman obviously intended to produce a book with sequential pagination for the reader's benefit as was his standard practice. Compositorial error can be ruled out: neither Middleton nor his compositors would supply a page number if none was marked in the received copy. Moreover, casting-off was a precise art essential to efficient printing, but the process categorically required copy to cast off. 33 The pagination gap, in short, is evidence that Bynneman had copy of a "missing text" in hand that was cast-off to produce the page number 201, which was passed along with copy to Middleton. The length of the "missing text" varies according to whether casting-off occurred before or after the gap at pages 36-46: if cast-off before, the length is 44 pages or 5½ sheets vs. 36 pages and 4½ sheets if after (note also that the correct page number for X4v is 156, not 164 as printed). The excess half-sheet normally would be used for the preliminaries if needed. The eventual omission of the "missing text" is clear evidence of a modification in the original plan for the book as presented to Bynneman. Gascoigne's withdrawal of a completed text seems quite improbable. Conversely, it is likely that the "missing text" was given to Bynneman in partially completed form with revisions and/or additions to be supplied later. The necessary assumption is that the text was completed in one of two senses: (1) the text required only minor revisions with little or no effect upon total length; or (2) a specific amount of text was to be added as defined either by a draft or an outline. An accurate casting-off would be greatly facilitated by a plan to add a precise number of stanzas of a fixed length to a partially completed verse text. A survey of Gascoigne's published work reveals only one candidate text that corresponds in length to the 5½ sheets yielded by an early casting-off. The fifty-four stanzas of uniform length that were added to "The reporter's conclusion unfinished" for the completed version of "Dan Bartholmew" as seen in The Posies brings the total length to forty-four pages or 5½ sheets. This assumes that the misplaced narrative link (Ii1-1v) was completed prior to casting-off; the assumption is clearly reasonable since it is the third sub-text in "Dan" and the second to be composed for the project (the enclosed poems are all earlier compositions). The fact that "Dan" was omitted from the planned location in pages 165-200 can be attributed to two related factors. Without the additional fifty-four stanzas, the text fit neither length of gap (36 or 44 pages), but this would be of no concern to Gascoigne—it was the printer's problem. More importantly, when Gascoigne abandoned the composition of "Dan", it could no longer stand alone as an independent text. So he attached it to "F.J.," "The devises," and "devises of Master Gascoigne" through the simple expedient of G. T.'s quite short transitional editorial link (Ee2v:8-12). As delivered to Smith, "Dan Bartholmew" is a sub-text with its title embedded in G. T.'s editorial frame. The textual oddity produced by this solution points to Gascoigne's original conception of "Dan Bartholmew" as an independent sub-text (as it later appeared in The Posies ). The editorial function of "The Reporter" exactly duplicates G. T.'s with the result that the global editor (G. T.), who is anthologizing poems by various authors, happens to incorporate a local editor's ("The Reporter") collection of poems by a single author. "Dan Bartholmew" simply does not belong in G. T.'s editorial realm. Furthermore, it can be argued on literary grounds that "Dan Bartholmew" was Gascoigne's initial experimentation with the narrative structure consisting of the incorporation of poems into an editorial framework. Perhaps Gascoigne laid "Dan" aside to perfect the approach in "F.J." and simply ran out of time, leaving "Dan" unfinished. 34 (3) The cancellation of B1-2 and the insertion of the anomalous imprint in page 164 clearly seem related to the modifications of Gascoigne's plan which produced the pagination gap at 164-201. The imprint in page 164 is significant evidence of Bynneman's preparation of copy for setting at the beginning of the project and reveals that, at that time, he viewed B-X as a self-contained production unit containing the texts of Supposes and Iocasta and preliminaries. As yet, Bynneman was unaware of any additional texts for the book. The terminal imprint at page 164 was marked in the manuscript by Bynneman at this time and indicates that the "original book" was limited to these two texts. The distinction between title-page and terminal imprints provides the key clue. The publisher provided and controlled the text for a title-page imprint and could clearly suppress the identification of the printer. Th title imprints of Bynneman's books as often follow the format "AT LONDON, | Imprinted for Richarde Smith." as the full format "H. Bynneman for H. Toy." and in some instances "Imprinted by F. Coldocke." the publisher. 35 (The omission of the date could reflect Smith's inexperience since A Hundreth was his first book.) On the other hand, the terminal imprint seems to have been a printer's tactic used usually to claim his work. Such imprints appear in two locations: (1) most frequently at the end of a book (as in Ii3r of A Hundreth ), and (2) occasionally at the end of an initial or intermediate section in a shared book. Were it not for the pagination gap 164-201, the imprint "Printed by Henrie Bynneman | for Richard Smith." on X4v would be a normal intermediate imprint followed by the sharing printer's section. As such it would indicate that Bynneman knew that more text was to follow and that he would pass it to a sharing printer. However, the reconstruction shows that the text of "F.J." was not delivered until mid-May and was passed to Middleton because of production circumstances and not as part of a preplanned sharing strategy. The imprint further reveals that Bynneman was unaware of the fact that the "missing text" was to be included in the book; otherwise, he would not have thus marked the end of the Iocasta manuscript. In short, this terminal imprint remained in copy as an oversight which the compositor faithfully set in X4v. The point at which Smith presented the "missing text" for casting-off is unclear, but there is no doubt that Bynneman still expected to print it in the assigned location when he passed copy for "F.J." with page number 201 to Middleton in mid-May. The cancellation of B1-2 most probably is the end product of Gascoigne's evolving text and his failure to deliver the "missing text." Three facts are clear: (1) the use of Bynneman-Y1a shows that sheet B was definitely printed as part of B-X and probably first; (2) sheet A containing the independent-text title " Supposes ," "The names of the Actors," and "Prologue" was printed last since it uses only the Guyot 76mm roman introduced in the final section (Dd-Ii) and contains "The contents." with page references; and (3), the whole sheet B was printed, followed later by the cancellation of B1-2. 36 Presumably the cancellation caused the resetting and movement of the preliminaries of Supposes to A4-4v. It seems reasonable to assume that these materials appeared in the cancelled B2-2v since no revisions or additions occur in The Posies ; the formats in the preliminaries of both plays remains stable as well. Since the sheet is signed B, Bynneman clearly intended to prefix a signature A, probably as a half-sheet of preliminaries including the standard errata list and contents. The contents of the cancelled B1-1v must remain conjectural, but given Gascoigne's penchant for (usually lengthy) prefatory letters to various segments of his audience, common sense suggests that such a letter appeared in B1-1v. Gascoigne's prefatory letters always contain specific, detailed references to the subsequent text(s). Hence a prefatory letter (or letters) delivered along with the manuscripts of the two plays and printed at the outset of the project simply would not introduce the book as a whole. However, the simple expedient of shifting B-X to the end of the book would have solved the problem since the letter then would introduce the rest of the book and reproduce Gascoigne's intended sequence of texts as well. 37 This solution was unavailable in only one circumstance: part of the letter (or one of the letters) carried over to B1 from sheet A. (This was no problem since casting-off permitted printing a divided text in reverse order.) Such an incomplete text would categorically require the radical solution of cancellation and the financial loss sustained thereby. In the final analysis, this view must remain conjectural, but the logic is difficult to reject: something in B1-2 required cancellation because of the change in Gascoigne's plan. 38</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI The reconstruction of the printing of A Hundreth provides a firm basis for editorial decisions toward a critical edition. Bynneman and Smith essentially produced a bibliographical record of the author's evolving concept of his collection of texts. Gascoigne began the project with the two plays and concluded it with an explicit reference to them in "The Printer to the Reader." Despite the intermediate changes in his plan, the two plays are an integral component of the book. A key stage occurred when Gascoigne halted the separate publication of the two plays in February. Why Smith agreed to this is puzzling since a division of copy into two books cost about the same to print and he could have begun realizing a return in February. In any event, a critical edition must include the two plays, but in the order representing the latest stage of Gascoigne's plan—after the four sub-texts of A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres . The minor problem of the original "The contents" can be resolved by moving this text to the textual notes with appropriate comment. It should be preserved since the bibliographical information is quite important. The insertion of the "De profundis" under its orphaned sub-title needs no defense: if Gascoigne's comment in "Phylomene" can be believed, it was a quite old composition and existed at the time printer's copy was prepared. The placement of the misplaced editorial link (Ii1) is clearly a problem: its location in A Hundreth may signify the order of composition of "Dan Bartholmew," but Bynneman was responsible for placing it in Ii1 rather than after the concluding link, where such corrections normally were inserted. It seems reasonable to put it in the proper location with a textual note including the correction notice. Finally, the modern reader responds to the extratextual components of graphic layout and titling just as did the Elizabethan. Prouty's duplication of the end-of-text settings at the junctions of segments of manuscript copy (see his "V" format and flowers in p. 106, corresponding to 2 M3, and the flowers in p. 218, corresponding to Cc4v) illustrates the incorrect impression conveyed by the transmission of a printer's errors into a modern edition. The editorial prose should be set continuously to signify the unbroken sequence of sub-texts. Similarly, the original running-titles ought to be amended and appear over their related sub-texts. It also seems desirable in a critical edition to indicate marginally the original page breaks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I dedicate this paper to the memory of Fredson Bowers whose death on 11 April 1991 deprived the bibliographical world of its guiding force. It is a great personal loss as well. He gave validity to my research when I had no idea that it was anything more than an accumulation of amusing bibliographical details. The idea of formulating my methods of analysis was entirely his. Without that guidance, it would all have amounted to nothing. His criticisms of my thinking and writing were blunt but respectful of my efforts which, at times, fell far short of the mark. For this I am grateful. Sit tibi terra levis . I thank The Huntington Library for an Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship which partially supported the research for this paper, and the staff of Reader Services and the Special Reading Room for their cheerful and efficient assistance. I also thank Mac Pigman (California Institute of Technology) for posing and discussing many of the issues considered here. 1 This paper assumes familiarity with concepts, principles, methods, and examples presented in earlier papers: "Reproductions of Early Dramatic Texts as a Source of Bibliographical Evidence," TEXT , 4 (1989), 237-268; "Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: The Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors" (hereafter "Font Analysis"), Studies in Bibliography , 43 (1990), 95-164; "Bibliographical Methods for Identifying Unknown Printers in Elizabethan/Jacobean Books" (hereafter "Printer Identification"), Studies in Bibliography , 44 (1991), 183-228; and my review of W. Craig Ferguson's Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England (1989) in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 83 (1989), 539-546 (hereafter "Review"). 2 See "Introduction," "Textual Notes," and "Critical Notes" in C. T. Prouty ed., George Gascoigne's A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres', The University of Missouri Studies , 17 (1942). Prouty's numbering of poems and lineation throughout the edition provides a convenient method of reference to the texts and follows the format "page:line." References to a second edition are to John W. Cunliffe ed., The Complete Works of George Gascoigne , vol. 1 (1907). In general, Prouty's analysis of the bibliographical and textual evidence was skewed by the assumption of a rapid, concurrent printing in Bynneman's shop with Gascoigne doing daily proof until about 19 March 1573 when he supposedly left for Holland. The single fact of Gascoigne's whereabouts during the period of about September 1572 to 25 May 1573 is his attachment to an English regiment in Holland on the latter date. Gascoigne's attendance at the Montague marriage sometime in the fall of 1572 seems plausible, but the rest of Prouty's account is speculative. 3 The most exhaustive and authoritative discussion of shared printing is found in Chapter 2, "Printing-house Methods", of Peter W. M. Blayney's The Texts of 'King Lear' and their Origins , vol. 1 (1982) (hereafter simply " Texts "). It is impossible to note adequately my debt to Blayney's work in every instance. With respect to the sharing climate, see pp. 51-52, 57. 4 Some appearances of Bynneman's ornamented initials as follows (single measurement for square pieces; others are height x width; no date for 1573 appearances). Doubleruled 'Vine-F' [16mm]: STC11635, K3; STC22243 (1576), T4. Double-ruled, black arabesque 'I' [16mm x 15mm]: STC11635, A4v; STC6901 (1572), * 3v; STC20309, F3v; STC3548 (1574), A4.

Double-ruled 'Sunflower-H' [16mm]: STC11635, B3; Bynneman's section (3A-T7v, 4E-K4) of STC4395 (1571, East and Middleton), 3H5v. 'Cropped Vine-T' [22mm]: STC 11635, Q1; STC22241, Lv4; STC15541, * 4; STC25429, E2. Double-ruled black arabesque 'O' [21mm x 22mm]: STC11635, R4; STC13063 (1574), H5. Middleton's 'W' [9mm]: STC11635, 2M3v; STC4395 (1571), A3; STC4055 (1572), * 7v, D1. No noted appearance of the ruled 'R' in 2 A1v in books by Middleton or East; used later by R. Robinson and R. Braddock. 5 This is the font that W. Craig Ferguson mis-identified as a Tavernier. The printer omitted a major revision to my "Review," p. 542, beginning at line 3 "The mis-labeled. . . ." The revision is found in "Printer Identification," note 27, p. 208, "Furthermore, the misidentified. . . ." 6 Details of S-face lower-case variants are found in "Font Analysis," pp. 110-113, with comment on the 'w4' in p. 112. 7 Ferguson overlooked this 79mm S-font. Additionally, Middleton used it in A Caveat STC12788 (1573), A1-4; An Answer STC540 (1573), A3v-4v; and East in Examen STC11844 (1578), A2-4. These 79mm S-fonts present a paradox. The bare height of the S-face is 82mm: it is physically impossible to reduce this height during lock-up. A 79mm font could conceivably be expanded to 82mm by leading (inserting a thin strip of lead between each line of type) but this was a practical impossibility since the leading would have to be a mere 0.1mm thick. In other instances of type cast on an undersized body, new punches were cut with shortened ascenders and descenders (see "Font Analysis," note 11, p. 152). No such modification occurred for these 79mm fonts. The only possible explanation for the 79mm body is an intended use in headings along with a smaller font as is done in some editorial links in 2M-S. 8 There are clear examples where this can be demonstrated by typographical and paper evidence. 9 See Texts , p. 51, for discussion of logical expectations based upon textual divisions and the sharing pattern in Bulkeley where Eld printed twenty-four sheets, Okes the next six, and Eld the last five; and "Printer Identification," p. 224, An Apology STC19295. 10 See "Printer Identification," p. 223, for examples of symmetrical patterns and note 44 for the apparently symmetrical pattern in All Fools STC4963 which suggests concurrent shared printing except for the identification of Eld-Y1 in AB, GH, and K. 11 See Texts , pp. 58-59, regarding problems arising from SR entries. The special problem here is that the Register containing book-entries for July 1571 to July 1576 has not survived. The practice of dating individual entries began with Register B in July 1576. See W. W. Greg, Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing (1956), pp. 23-31. 12 See "Printer Identification," pp. 191-203. 13 Two classes of job-lots of papers are encountered in Elizabethan books corresponding to differences in the production and delivery system. First, bales of paper arrived in England for sale to printers and publishers containing homogeneous watermarks consisting of either a single pair of twin watermarks or groups of twins from moulds with very similar or nearly identical watermarks fashioned for a single, large paper mill or for a consortium of smaller mills. Such a job-lot may appear to yield a significant parallel distribution pattern in two sections of a book or in two or more books, but the pattern is illusory, reflecting only the order in which papers from different vats in a production center were gathered and baled for shipment. Second, valuable printing evidence is often provided by papers exhibiting heterogeneous, unrelated watermarks produced in the numerous "single-vat-and-pair-of-moulds" family operations located along networks of streams in various continental locations. Paper factors collected these lots of paper and baled them for shipment to England. The random sequence of individual lots in a bale can provide a rather accurate indication of printing sequence. A parallel distribution of watermarks by sheet will emerge if a daily allotment of papers was supplied to two sharing printers from the same job-lot of heterogeneous papers. An offset in the distribution pattern is clear evidence of when the sharing printer began work relative to the primary printer. If the distribution reveals an exclusive watermark in each concurrent pair of sheets (e.g., no overlap of the watermarks with prior and subsequent sheets) and this relation is constant throughout the book, there seems little reason to doubt concurrent shared printing. An extensive survey of watermarks in books throughout a production year can locate a book in the production schedule given a sequence of heterogeneous job-lots and an overlapping at the beginning or end of the book. For background on watermark evidence, see Allan Stevenson, "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," Studies in Bibliography , 1 (1948), 151-182; "Watermarks are Twins," Studies in Bibliography , 4 (1951-52), 57-91; "Chain Indentations in Paper as Bibliographical Evidence," Studies in Bibliography , 6 (1955), 181-195; and David L. Vander Meulen, "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad," Studies in Bibliography , 37 (1984), 58-81. The literature on watermarks is extensive, but the outdated A Short Guide to Books on Watermarks (Paper Publications Society, Hilverson, Holland, 1955) provides an early overview. A valuable resource is Edward Heawood's "Sources of Early English Paper Supply," The Library : 2nd ser., 10 (1929-30), 282-307, 429-454; 11 (1930-31), 263-302, 466-498; 3rd ser., 2 (1947), 119-141. 14 This family of related watermarks appears exclusively in The Huntington's copies of the following books by Bynneman. 1572: Of Ghosts STC15320, An Answer Q1 STC25427. 1573: A Hundreth STC11635, An Answer Q1,3 STC25427,29, Historicae Brytannicae STC 20309, Arte of Reason STC15541, T. First Parte STC22241, T. Garden STC12464 [?mixed with an anomalous "hand-star" paper]; the following books from 1573 were not checked for papers: STC3737, 7623, 11985, 13603, 13846, 19060, 23003, 24171, 24788, 25010. 1574: Sermons STC4449, A Viewe STC15003, A Catholike STC17408, Historia STC25004, T. Defense STC25430, and all of T. Three Partes STC22241 including Bynneman's section 2A-K2. 1575: T. Posies STC11636. 1576: T. Steele Glas STC11645 (A-I2) and The Complaint of Phylomene (K-O). The longevity of moulds was quite remarkable, some producing papers for nearly a half-century. The "hand-star" watermarks appear in a 1604 book printed by Eld. The commonness of these papers in Bynneman's books confirms Richard Tottle's allegations regarding the efforts of French papermakers to sabotage his efforts to found an English paper mill: "the Ffrenchemen did by all meanes possible labor to distroye [theire] worke begonne . . . as by procuringe all our ragges (beinge the chief substance that paper is made of) to be brought over to them, by bringinge in greate aboundaunce of paper at that tyme and sellinge it (although to losse) better chepe then they were hable to doe" (see Edward Arber, A Transcript of the Registers , I, 242, for the complete letter). The time referred to is approximately 1564 onward, with Tottle's effort in approximately 1573. 15 See "Printer Identification," pp. 223-225. 16 See "Printer Identification," pp.207-215. 17 See "Printer Identification," note 41, p. 219. 18 The fouling process and the principle of random recurrence according to the probability ratio are discussed in Section VI, "Font Analysis," pp. 126-141, especially pp. 129-131, 137-139. 19 No example of S-face 'g1' or other fouling letters occurs in STC5952, 11759, and 22991. The introduction of 'w4' occurred late in the printing of STC5952. The 'w4' fouling in STC5952 seems to be limited to the final sheet Hh and the preliminaries (A1-8, bc) given the minimal emphasis use of the font in the remainder of the book although some long quotation passages (twenty percent of U5-8 and T1-5, and nearly complete pages at C8-D1 and Q5-7) should yield 'w4' if it was in the font. The clustering of alternate settings suggests that the compositor set several 'vv' from the Y1 case, then several 'w4' from the S1 case on affected pages. The ratios reveal a high-density alternating pattern (STC5952 A2-4v: 'w4'/'vv': 1/4, 7/14, 14/9, 14/4, 10/11, 6/12); STC11759, A2-5v: 3/8, 0/22, 8/4, 5/10, 3/14, 0/11, 0/7; STC25427, E1-2v: 0/8, 9/20, 3/26, 0/8; I1-3: 5/0, 14/0, 5/17, 0/13, 8/3). It is not clear whether the erratic variation is attributable to the preferences of two compositors working on several books simultaneously in irregular stints or the fouling of only one Y1-case. The non-appearance of 'w4' in Y1 settings in 2E, A of the Latin STC19139 and I-2A, * 2-3v of STC19137 in 1572, and the books of Groups I and II in 1573, all of which were printed after the entry of S-face 'g1', probably reflects a complete purging of the 'w4' from the 'v' sort box after its final appearance in 2L2v of STC25427. 20 The census of May 1583 credited three presses to both Bynneman and Middleton, and one press to East (see Arber, Transcript , I, 248). However, this number probably included the spare proofing press kept by many printers. Judging from Middleton's known output in 1573, he in all probability did not use even two presses simultaneously for any significant length of time unless half of his output is hidden in shared sections. Bynneman's output is credible for two presses and an intermittent use of a third. For extensive discussion of this problem and annual production rates, see Texts , pp. 41, 42-43, 57-58, 61-63. 21 For example, numbers 82 and 83 were transposed in L3v-4 along with the furniture as both appear in the gutter margin. Page numbers 513 and 516 in STC3737, correctly imposed in the outer forme at 3X1 and 3X2v, remained on the stone (probably along with the correct new numbers) and were transposed during incorrect imposition in the inner forme at 3X2 and 3X1v respectively. In other instances, the numbers were simply transposed or new numbers omitted, as in STC25010 (237, 238, 239, 238, 241; 301, 302, 330, 340), STC13063 (42, 43, 42, 45, 46; 157, 158, 157, 160; 325, 326, 372, 328). A more complicated instance occurs in T. Fourth Parte STC22243 (1576) where T3 is numbered 149 and T3v is numbered 1410. The compositor intended to scavenge a "14" from the outer forme (as he did for T1v-2) and did so. New numbers "5 0" (for page 150) were probably placed on the stone but during imposition a left-over "1" was set instead of the "5," producing the "1410." 22 See W. W. Greg's discussion of the printer's notation for signatures and page numbers in "An Elizabethan Printer and his Copy," The Library , 4th ser., 4 (1924), 105-107. 23 See "Font Analysis," pp. 131-135. 24 STC25427,28,29 answered An Admonition to the Parliament STC10847,48, which was printed surreptitiously by the secret Puritan press in summer 1572. Queen Elizabeth apparently put Lord Burghley to the task of suppression through the agency of the Bishop of London. The authors were imprisoned by 7 July but the queen's furor continued unabated and broke forth in the proclamation of 11 June 1573, which attacked the book and commanded "al and euery Printer, Stationer, Booke bynder, Marchaunt" (and everyone else) to turn in copies to the Bishop of the affected diocese (see Arber, Transcript , I, 464). The Bishop of London reported to Burghley that none had been turned in by 2 July 1573 (Arber, I, 466). Elizabeth issued several proclamations against seditious books in general, but this seems the only book that merited its own proclamation. The book was still "hot" in 1578 when Thomas Woodcock was imprisoned for selling it (Arber, I, 484). An Answer was still in the stock of the bookseller Thomas Chard in 1583-84, which confirms the printing of large editions of Q1-3 as is suggested by the nature of the controversy; see Robert Jahn, "Letters and Booklists of Thomas Chard (or Chare) of London, 1583-84," The Library , 4th ser., 4 (1924), 229, 235. The significant fact is that Q3 STC25429, despite the addition of five sheets of argument, makes no reference to the Puritan's response to Q1 STC25427 entitled A Replie to An Answer STC4711. Moreover, the specific page references in A Replie show that the author Thomas Cartwright knew only An Answer Q1 STC25427. The dating of the series of Puritan treatises and Whitgift's replies is controversial and comment must await a future note. It is clear, however, that STC4711 and STC25429 were being printed during the same period. 25 See John W. Cunliffe's collation in The Works , I, 485-488. 26 The folio format permitted the use of larger titling fonts. A dramatic text in quarto used 96mm roman for the Act/scene heads and pica roman for the stage directions and speech prefixes. The compositor shifted to double-pica black letter in the cast (K2v) and the orders of "the dumme showes" in Iocasta , setting " The Argument " in double-pica italic followed by the 96mm roman verse. 27 In this context, the compositor's setting of the letters of H. W. and G. T. at the beginning of the "F.J." manuscript illustrates an interpretation that reflects continuous copy. The letters are treated as integral components of the main text and not as preliminaries. Hence they are headed by pica rather than double-pica sub-titles which places them on the same level as the titles of the poems and the narrative links. Furthermore, "H. VV. to the Reader." is headed by a large 56mm "Cornucopia-I" and the first line is set in double-pica, indicating the very beginning of the "F.J." subtext. G. T.'s letter is headed by a smaller 21mm 'R'. Both letters are set full measure throughout and no tail-piece or other ornament separates them. In contrast, "The Printer to the Reader." clearly was a separate manuscript and exhibits the end-of-text "V" format followed by a 17mm x 65mm setting of flowers in A3 (unsigned). The conclusions of the two verse texts of the plays naturally eliminated the "V" format but both set a "Finis" followed by an ornament (see K1v, X4v); the absence of catchwords is normal at the end of independent texts. 28 See W. W. Greg, "An Elizabethan Printer and his Copy," pp. 107-108. The uncanny correspondences between the two setting problems should not go unmentioned: both involve a transition to a translation of a sub-text from Orlando Furioso , the one an allegory, the other "allegorized," one set from continuous copy with an ornament inserted but no page break, the other set from a junction of two manuscripts with flowers inserted and an inappropriate page break. 29 Middleton's compositors set poem titles in either roman or italic pica thus: (1) one or more lines of italic; (2) the first line in italic followed by one or more lines of roman; (3) the first line in italic followed by one or more lines of 67mm roman. 30 The very long lines encountered in the text of 2 S1v-2 expanded the measure from 86mm to 103mm and required either modification of the skeleton or construction of a new one. The furniture of 2 S1v-2 was replaced since the catchwords as well as page numbers move to the new letterpress margins. 2 S3v is normal in this respect, but the page number (343) of 2 S4 is 100.5mm from the left margin although the catchword is spaced the normal 86mm. 31 A third date found in No. 74, "Gascoignes voyage into Holland. An. 1572," is given as Gascoigne's date of departure to Holland: "In March it was, that cannot I forget, | In this last March upon the nintenth day, | . . . the very twentith day we set | Our sayles abrode ---" (187:31-36). 19 March 1572/73 served as the cornerstone of Prouty's hypothesis of rapid printing and publication in early April following the belated delivery of copy for the misplaced link. He mistakenly attributed the authorship of the correction notice and the concluding editorial link to Bynneman despite the internal evidence of Gascoigne's authorship. Prouty's conjecture that Gascoigne returned to England during the fall of 1572 seems certain, but that he remained until 19 March 1572/73 is contradicted by the printing and textual evidence. This date is clearly false in that context. Beyond that, the specificity of the date is quite extraordinary in a poem, and even more so because of Gascoigne's emphatic avowal "that cannot I forget." If he indeed was under threat of an investigation by the Privy Council (see Prouty, p. 16) and fled, it would have been of legal importance to publish the claim that he did not sail for Holland until 19 March although Dutch ports were reopened to English shipping in January 1572/73. Flight to avoid investigation and possible prosecution is a prima facie admission of guilt. He had been jailed before for debt (see Prouty, p. 17) and could probably have expected to be again. The published date would serve as testimony that he had been in England all the while even though the Privy Council's agents could not find him. If we trust his prefatory letter to the second edition, A Hundreth was sensational both in court and abroad and the 19 March date probably became "common knowledge." In the final analysis, this date is a fiction like everything else in A Hundreth —the "printer," H. W., G. T., the "sundrie Gentlemen," The Reporter, the "written regyster," and Master F. J. and everyone else in the castle in northern England (see Robert P. Adams, "Gascoigne's 'Master F. J.' as Original Fiction," PMLA , 63 [1958], 315-326; Frank B. Fieler, "Gascoigne's Use of Courtly Love Conventions in 'The Adventures Passed by Master F. J.,'" Studies in Short Fiction , 1 [1963], 26-32; and Leicester Bradner, "Point of View in George Gascoigne's Fiction," Studies in Short Fiction, 3 [1965], 16-22). In short, the printing and textual evidence can be trusted to show that Gascoigne was gone before printing began in late January. 32 According to the title in "The contents," "Lastly the dolorous discourse of Dan Bartholmew," the first direction could mean anywhere after the beginning of "Dan" in Ee2v (412), which makes no reference to "dolorous discourse," or within the series of poems introduced by the sub-title "Dan Bartholmew, Dolorous discourses" in Ff2v (420). Although "Supplication to Care" does not correspond to any sub-title, it seems clear from the conclusion of No. 5, "To Care I make this supplication," and the sub-title of No. 6, "His libell of request exhibited to Care," that the link belongs before this point in Hh1 (433). It is clear that whoever supplied page 430 for the correction notice picked the first textual break within the "Dolorous discourses" which occurs at the end of the first discourse occupying Ff2v-Gg3v (420-430). The link makes no textual sense in Gg3v (430): its opening reference to the preceding "triumph," "The vaunting verses with many mo," corresponds to page 420. Several textual inconsistencies in "Dan" clearly point to Gascoigne's failure to integrate completely the poems into the editorial frame through a much needed stage of revision. The first discourse in Ff2v (420) begins "I have entreated care to cut the thread," which can only refer to No. 6 in Gg3v which begins "O Curteous Care . . . O knife that canst cut off the thred of thrall." Next, "The contents" lists "his triumphes," The Reporter's first link makes the transition "His triumpes here I thinke will shewe no lesse," and the sub-title also is in the plural: "Dan Bartholmew his Triumphes." But only one "triumph" poem is included. The Posies inserts two additional "triumphs": the "third Triumphe" is No. 34 ( 2 Q4, 327) of "The devises" moved to the new position. The "second Triumphe" either had not been composed or was omitted during the preparation of printer's copy. Gascoigne clearly attempted to employ the "chain" device to link the sequence of poems through a narrative flow from one to the next. The core group may have originally been composed as a chained posie, but the integration into the editorial frame was never accomplished. Perhaps Gascoigne's abandonment of "Dan" and its subsequent incorporation into G. T.'s editorial frame is a symptom of this failure. See also Prouty's comments, pp. 277-294 (it is worth noting two important typographical errors in Prouty's notes to "Epitaph uppon capitaine Boucher " [No. 68] and the Montague masque, p. 282. Both dates should read "1572," not "1573," and are correctly given in the "Introduction"). The reconstruction is unclear as to the amount of delay between the delivery of the manuscripts of "Dan" and the misplaced link but raises the distinct possibility that Gascoigne became confused about the order of materials in the "Dan" manuscript by the time he wrote the correction notice. 33 This is absolutely clear from Joseph Moxon's contemporary description of the process. Mechanick Exercises on the whole Art of Printing , ed. Herbert Davis &amp; Harry Carter (1958), pp. 239-244. Invaluable insight is provided in W. Speed Hill's comparison of the casting-off marks in the Pullen manuscript with the folio produced from this manuscript by John Windet. See "Casting Off Copy and the Composition of Hooker's Book V," Studies in Bibliography, 33 (1980), 144-161, with a reproduction at p. 147. See also W. H. Bond, "Casting Off Copy by Elizabethan Printers: A Theory," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 42 (1948), 281-291. 34 The transfer of No. 34 from its intended position in the "triumphs" section (see note 32 above) in "Dan" (as found in The Posies ) may reflect this compositional sequence. The Reporter's first link probably was the first to be written and introduces the "triumphs" with No. 34 probably in mind. The three "triumphs" in The Posies obviously were juxtaposed without any compelling internal textual rationale other than general subject matter. It is plausible that, while later assembling materials for "The devises," Gascoigne realised that No. 34 was needed in the courtship sequence of No. 32-35. He inserted it with the title "Another shorter discourse to the same effecte," a reference to No. 33, "The Lover declareth his affection." No. 35 then refers to the momentary "blisse" of No. 34 occasioned by "And how thou seemdst to like me well" (line 15). No. 34 is essential here, since No. 35, "The lover disdaynefully rejected contrary to former promise," requires this stage of recognition by the lady. 35 See Blayney's discussion of a manuscript title page, with reproduction, Texts , pp. 259-262. 36 Greg and Prouty report a total of four cancellation stubs. Further, the appearance of half of the watermark in B3 of The Huntington's copy indicates cancellation: half-sheet imposition by the "work and turn" method produces a conjugate fold with the entire watermark. Hence, the whole sheet B was printed for at least five extant copies. 37 Bynneman was quite adept at resolving organizational problems. For example, Supposes was set line-for-line from A Hundreth up to and including the pagination gap at 36-45 for The Posies . Because of Gascoigne's reorganization of the texts in the second edition, the text of Supposes is found in the middle of the book with the original B3 and page 1. Bynneman simply set roman numeral pagination ("clix") to that point to solve the problem. 38 A second possibility is that the letter contained explicit references to the "missing text." However, it seems that the economics of cancellation would lead to toleration of the inconsistency, especially in view of the fact that Gascoigne was not present to demand the correction. One kind of compositorial error is conceivable as the cause of the cancellation but can be rejected: a mis-imposition of either B1-2v or B1v-2. Such an error would have been caught almost immediately and corrected. For example, only one exemplar of sheet B of Monsieur d'Olive (Clark copy) with mis-imposed pages in the outer form survived, probably in a copy scavenged from discarded sheets by compositors for sale on the black market.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">How Much Did Farquhar's Beaux Spend in London? by Alan Roper</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early in The Beaux Stratagem Aimwell and Archer review their finances, having just arrived in Lichfield from London. Archer asks how much money they have left. "But Two hundred Pound," Aimwell replies, and the more sanguine Archer, responding to the glumness of "But," cheerfully enlarges the reckoning: "And our Horses, Cloaths, Rings, &amp;c. why we have very good Fortunes now for moderate People; and let me tell you, besides Thousand, that this Two hundred Pound, with the experience that we are now Masters of, is a better Estate than the Ten we have spent." So the text reads in Bernard Lintott's two quarto editions of the play in 1707, and, plainly enough, it reads as nonsense, garbled by that intrusive "besides Thousand." Plainly too, "besides Thousand" must be authorial, although, as set, it cannot represent Farquhar's intention. No copyist or compositor would make up those two words, putting them impossibly together, and there is nothing in the surrounding text to prompt eye-skip. The few editors who comment on the intrusive phrase agree that "Thousand" has been "misplaced" in the sentence, but they do not explain how the misplacement might have occurred. Those who so comment also agree in moving "Thousand" down to follow "Ten." But no compositor with legible copy before him would be likely to displace a word so far. The intrusive phrase, indeed, not only seems to be authorial but also to represent two separate emendations, which, probably because they were crowded between lines or into a margin, caused a problem in the printing house. But what were they supposed to emend and how? When Lintott published the first edition of The Beaux Stratagem on 27 March 1707, less than three weeks after the play's premiere, he included a brief, prefatory apology by Farquhar which runs in part: "The Reader may find some Faults in this Play, which my Illness prevented the amending of." Farquhar may have meant that he was too ill to revise his copy fully, or too ill to correct the printed pages, or too ill to do either. Within weeks he was dead, leaving no indication of what was to be done with "besides Thousand." Editorial intervention seems called for, but any intervention must necessarily be unauthoritative. 1 For this reason, we may suppose, the quarto reading of Archer's speech—call it version A—has twice reappeared, each time without comment, in twentieth-century editions prepared by Cecil A. Moore in 1933 and by Shirley Strum Kenny in 1988. 2 Other modern editors, no doubt thinking to supply readers with a text that makes sense, have been less conservative. In that endeavor they have been anticipated by eighteenth-century printers, beginning with those for a collected edition in octavo— The Comedies of Mr. George Farquhar —jointly published in 1708 by Lintott, James Knapton, Ralph Smith, and George Strahan. Their version of Archer's speech, version B, deals with the problem by simply deleting "besides Thousand" and supplying a text that runs: "and let me tell you, that this Two hundred Pound, with the Experience that we are now Masters of, is a better Estate than the Ten we have spent." When the four booksellers reissued the Comedies in 1711, Lintott augmented it with Farquhar's miscellaneous prose and verse, calling the whole volume The Works Of the late Ingenious Mr. George Farquhar . . . The Second Edition . 3 Version B of Archer's speech was retained for the Works in 1711 and for the third and fourth editions of the Works in 1714 and 1718. Two years after the first edition of the Comedies an evidently unauthorized edition in octavo of The Beaux Stratagem appeared at "London. Printed in the Year 1710." This is the edition identified by Professor Kenny as printed for T. Johnson at The Hague for import into England. 4 It also offers us a different version of Archer's speech, retaining all the words of version A but mending the sense and grammar by keeping "besides" and carrying "Thousand" down to follow "Ten." Version C runs as follows: "and let me tell you besides, that this Two hundred Pound, with the experience that we are now Masters of, is a better Estate than the Ten Thousand we have spent." Johnson reissued the play in 1720, again with version C of Archer's speech. The solution of T. Johnson or his reader may strike us as attractive because it is at once thrifty with the words and plausible in its sense. As we shall see, the solution has appealed to many later editors. It nonetheless lay forgotten for nearly two centuries, thrust aside by a powerful competitor. A new edition of The Works of the late Ingenious Mr. George Farquhar appeared in 1728 and announced itself as "Corrected from the Errors of former Impressions." 5 Among other errors addressed was the B version of Archer's speech which had appeared in "former Impressions" of the Comedies and Works . The text in 1728 agreed with version C in carrying version A's "Thousand" down to follow "Ten" but, finding "besides" superfluous, omitted it. Version D accordingly reads as follows: "and let me tell you, that this two hundred Pound, with the Experience that we are now Masters of, is a better Estate than the ten thousand we have spent." Professor Kenny persuasively argues that "the theatre seems the most likely source" for other revisions to be found in the 1728 text, and its D version of Archer's speech may also represent playhouse tradition. If so, we may assume that it discards "besides" because the word adds little to the sense and slows a syntax soon to be further delayed by the parenthetic "with the Experience that we are now Masters of." Whatever its logic, version D reappeared in subsequent eighteenth-century "Impressions" of the Works , as well as many separate editions of the play, and was, indeed, the most favored version until late in the nineteenth century. It was adopted for the various collections of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth century, most of them made up of separately published plays, which claimed that their texts were "regulated from the prompt books" in use at the Theatres Royal, or taken "from the prompt books," or "marked with the variations in the Manager's book," or "as performed," or "accurately printed from the acting copies." These collections—Bell's British Theatre, The New English Theatre, Inchbald's British Theatre, Sharpe's British Theatre, Oxberry's New English Drama, and others, some of them issued more than once —offer, or at least claim to offer, the acting version of Archer's speech, although there was obviously much copying of one from another. By 1763, in an edition of the play for J. Rivington, "Two hundred Pound" had become "two hundred pounds," and the variant was transmitted to all subsequent editions adopting version D. When version D seemed near the end of its textual life, an 1871 edition of the play in Dicks' British Drama (reissued in 1879 in Dicks' Standard Plays) retained "pounds" and added another variant by deleting "a" and "Estate," so that the final clause runs: "is better than the ten thousand we have spent." But these variants do not affect the disposition of "besides Thousand" and so may be included in version D. If we accept Professor Kenny's description of the 1728 edition of the Works , in which version D first appeared, and if, with considerably more caution, we accept the claim of the later collections that their texts were based on prompt books, then we can say that version D represents a long-lasting theatrical tradition. Many eighteenth-and nineteenth-century audiences, we may suppose, heard Archer assure Aimwell that they had spent £10,000 in London. For a long time, indeed, version D met with very little competition. Dublin editions of 1729, 1753, and 1775 adopted version B and simply omitted "besides Thousand," no doubt because they were set, at least in the first instance, from one of the London editions issued prior to 1728. 6 In the nineteenth century, though, version B reappeared as what we may call an editorial alternative to the theatrical tradition represented by version D. Leigh Hunt adopted version B for his Dramatic Works of Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar , published in 1840 and reissued in 1849, 1851, and 1860. Version B also appeared in Alexander Charles Ewald's Dramatic Works of George Farquhar in 1892 and in H. Macaulay Fitzgibbon's edition of the play for the Temple Dramatists in 1898. Since these editions leave the passage unglossed, we cannot tell whether the editors took version B from one or other of the early eighteenth-century editions or arrived at it independently when confronted with the garbled reading of Q1. The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, and an independent solution to the garbled reading of version A looks to be almost certain in the case of the only other rival to version D to appear between 1728 and 1906. Version E has no text: everything from "and let me tell you" down to "we have spent" is omitted, presumably on the grounds that Farquhar's intended meaning is irretrievably lost. Version E appeared in a series called Cumberland's British Theatre, first published in the 1820's and reissued in the 1860's. It seems unlikely that the decision to excise the passage was made by John Cumberland, the publisher, or by his compositor. More probably, the decision was made by George Daniel, who is often listed as the editor of Cumberland's British Theatre, although he was officially credited only with the biographical and critical notices prefixed to the plays. Daniel's solution to the problem of version A, cutting instead of untying the knot, has found no support. It remains one more eccentricity in an eccentric textual history. William Archer inaugurated the dominant twentieth-century tradition when editing four of Farquhar's plays for the Mermaid Series in 1906. Ignoring (perhaps in the root rather than the derived sense of the word) the long ascendancy of version D, Archer supplied in a note the reading of Q1 and remarked that "Editors have been content simply to drop out the unintelligible words 'besides Thousand.'" Archer referred, that is, to version B and almost certainly had Ewald's edition in mind, perhaps Hunt's and Fitzgibbon's also. We need not suppose that he knew about the eighteenth-century life of version B. Nor need we suppose that he knew about T. Johnson's two editions of 1710 and 1720, even though Archer solved the problem of Q1 by adopting version C and referring to it as "my emendation," which, he insisted, "is less sweeping than the silent deletion of two words." Archer's Mermaid edition was reissued in 1949 and 1959, and most twentieth-century editors have adopted his solution, although none gives him credit and only one, A. E. Morgan in 1935, gives credit to T. Johnson or his reader. 7 Version C appeared in Louis A. Strauss's 1914 edition for the Belles-Lettres Series and Frederic and James W. Tupper's Representative English Dramas from Dryden to Sheridan , published in the same year. It can be found in such anthologies as Eighteenth Century Comedy , edited by W. D. Taylor in 1929 then revised by Simon Trussler in 1969; Plays of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century , edited by Dugald MacMillan and Howard Mumford Jones in 1931; British Dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan , edited by George H. Nettleton and Arthur E. Case in 1939 and still widely used in the revision (of the commentary only) by George Winchester Stone, Jr., first issued in 1969; and Brice Harris's edition of Restoration Plays for the Modern Library, which first appeared in 1953 and is still in print. Charles Stonehill, noting that version B "omitted ['besides Thousand'], in desperation," favored version C for The Works of George Farquhar in 1930 (reprinted 1969), an edition replacing Ewing's as standard and now in its turn replaced by Professor Kenny's, and the same version can be found in several individual texts of The Beaux Stratagem , among them one published in 1928 with an introduction by Bonamy Dobrée and those edited by Eric Rothstein for the Crofts Classics in 1967, by A. Norman Jeffares for the Fountainwell Drama Texts in 1972, and by Charles N. Fifer for the Regents Restoration Drama in 1977. J. Hamard's English and French edition of 1965 ( La Ruse des Galants ) also features version C. In our own century, generations of college students and, we may guess, of playgoers have known Archer's speech in version C, just as in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries most readers and, we are assured, most playgoers knew the speech in version D. In the twentieth, it is true, there have been occasional rivals to version C, and they include most of the possibilities. To be sure, if twentieth-century editors have known about George Daniel's version E, and it seems unlikely that they have, they must also have found it, in Archer's terms, too "sweeping" for adoption. 8 But, as noted, version A has been resurrected for the conservative texts of Cecil A. Moore in 1933 and Professor Kenny in 1988. Then, too, Archer may have discredited version B, but he did not succeed in extinguishing it. An Everyman collection of Restoration Plays , introduced by Sir Edmund Gosse in 1912 and reprinted into the 1960's, offers version B, which can also be found in an anthology of The Chief British Dramatists edited by Brander Matthews and Paul Robert Lieder in 1924, in Norman Marshall's 1953 edition of Three Restoration Comedies , and in Vincent F. Hopper and Gerald B. Lahey's 1963 college text of The Beaux Stratagem . Even version D enjoyed a fleeting second life when John Earle Uhler adopted it in 1929 for his edition of The Best Eighteenth Century Comedies . 9 The twentieth century has also witnessed the birth of yet another version of Archer's speech. In 1923 David Harrison Stevens included The Beaux Stratagem in Types of English Drama 1660-1780 and produced what we must call version F of Archer's speech by retaining "besides" from version A but omitting "Thousand": "and, let me tell you besides, that this two hundred pound, with the experience that we are now masters of, is a better estate than the ten we have spent." With the pointing mended by omitting the comma after "and," version F reappeared in Michael Cordner's 1976 edition of The Beaux Stratagem for the New Mermaids. The logic of version F would seem to be that "besides" may be retained as harmless enough, whereas retaining "Thousand" and making it grammatical in the manner of versions C and D would entail a major change in the sense for which there is no authorial and no true textual authority. The various attempts to mend the sense of Archer's speech, or at least those represented by versions C, D, and F, evidently assume that "besides Thousand" must represent two separate additions to the passage which were made by Farquhar himself. I have found no exemplar reflecting the assumption that we have to deal with authorial substitution rather than addition. And yet version B, discarding "besides Thousand," makes a certain kind of sense, hence, we may suppose, its occasional reappearance in modern texts as well as its occasional adaptation into version F. Discussing version A, William Archer also explained the sense of version B at the same time as he insisted that it needed clarification: "'the ten we have spent' (implying, of course, 'ten hundred pound') is a feeble and almost impossible phrase." The phrase is certainly unusual and offers us an elliptical parallelism perhaps appropriate in a text merely to be read but just as certainly ambiguous in a text to be performed. The same thought perhaps occurred to Farquhar, who accordingly sacrificed parallelism to clarity and wrote "Thousand" into his manuscript as a replacement for "Ten," not to change the meaning or enlarge the reckoning but to specify the sum without ambiguity. At the same time, perhaps, he wrote in "besides," not as an adverbial addition (which later proved sufficiently superfluous to be dropped from version D) but as a prepositional substitute for "with." I am proposing that Farquhar meant his revised text to read as follows: "and let me tell you, that this Two hundred Pound, besides the experience that we are now Masters of, is a better Estate than the Thousand we have spent." By alphabetical progression we should call this version G, which, I believe, makes better sense in immediate context, in the larger context of a play so preoccupied with specific sums of money, and perhaps in terms of the social realities it to some extent addresses. Aimwell and Archer are not only gentlemen but younger brothers as well, Aimwell certainly so, Archer at least claiming to be so, and the portions of younger sons were notoriously small. True, they seem to have combined their resources, but £10,000 would represent the sum of two remarkably handsome portions. Young Fashion in Vanbrugh's The Relapse has an annuity of £200, or had one until he mortgaged it for £500; his elder brother has £5,000 a year and can afford to lay out £10,000 to purchase a title. Benjamin Wou'dbe in Farquhar's The Twin-Rivals has a portion of £1,500; his elder brother is heir to £7,000 a year. These sums no doubt involve an element of literary flourish, 10 but the large discrepancy between an heir's portion and his younger brother's corresponds well enough to social realities. 11 In the immediate context of Archer's speech there is also a notable discrepancy between £200 and £10,000, so that, if version C or D is accepted, £200 would require huge augmentation from "experience" in order to constitute "a better Estate than" £10,000. Archer, we should remember, describes Aimwell and himself as "moderate People." But the C and D versions of his succeeding claim push optimism into an almost absurd extravagance. Moreover, how did two "moderate People" manage to run through £10,000 in what seems to be not too much time? Benjamin Wou'dbe, though a profligate, still needed two years to spend his £1,500 and a further £500 in loans. When Cherry seeks to entice Archer into marrying her by telling him she has £2,000, he calculates that "the Fortune may go off in a Year or two." Perhaps we should ask not only how much money but also how much time Aimwell and Archer spent in London before coming to Lichfield. Then too, Archer is tempted, if briefly, by Cherry's £2,000. He and Aimwell regard Dorinda's £10,000 dowry as a sufficient prize, even when divided between them, and yet, if we accept version C or D, they have just run through £10,000 in London. These financial discontinuities, more obvious, to be sure, in a reading than in a performance, disappear if we suppose that Farquhar meant to assign the two younger brothers £1,200 between them, of which they have £200 left, that he first wrote "Ten," meaning ten hundred, then revised it for clarity to "Thousand." But Farquhar wrote The Beaux Stratagem while sick and dying, declared that his illness prevented him from amending its faults, and left it with clear signs of hasty or careless plotting, especially in the resolution. Should we not, then, be cautious of explaining a crux in terms of logic and consistency? I acknowledge the objection but answer that terms producing inconsistency cannot be thought more defensible. We have some textual authority for assuming that Farquhar first meant his beaux to have spent ten (hundred) pounds in London. We have none for assuming that he eventually meant them to have spent ten thousand. Yet, by unauthoritative emendation, most twentieth-century texts of the play, as well as many earlier ones, make Aimwell and Archer spend £10,000. Such a sum, we have to say, represents an interpretation as much critical as textual. Unsurprisingly, therefore, it has found its way into critical discourse. I said that version C (or D) produces inconsistency, and so it does in terms of strict financial accounting and calculation. Symbolically, though, as I think its defenders would argue, version C makes the sum spent by the beaux consistent with the £10,000 dowry that Mrs. Sullen brought to her marriage and the £10,000 available to Dorinda as a portion and to the beaux as a prize. Writing about The Beaux Stratagem , Ronald Berman bids us "begin by taking a look at the final cause of the play, the sum of ten thousand pounds. The efficient cause is only the attempt to get it. . . . It is the sum of money the beaux have spent, the sum they are after, the dowry of Mrs. Sullen, the dowry of Dorinda." 12 The equations are certainly neat, but one of the terms is suspect. Berman does not specify the edition he used, but it no doubt featured version C, so widely available in the twentieth century and often making editorial emendation look like authorial intention by omitting a textual apparatus that could contain the quarto reading and its crux. Berman's triad reappears, independently it seems, in Michael Cordner's discussion of the play. "Of great significance to . . . all [the principals] is the figure of ten thousand pounds. This is the amount that Archer and Aimwell have already spent in London; it is also the amount of Mrs. Sullen's dowry and of Dorinda's fortune." 13 Oddly enough, Cordner writes this by way of introduction to a text he has himself established which features version F of Archer's speech and the claim that the beaux have spent only ten (hundred) pounds. I do not mean to sneer. Many years ago I myself wrote a critical essay about The Beaux Stratagem and, like others, referred to the sums of money so frequently mentioned in the play. By mere luck I had no occasion to talk about the sum Aimwell and Archer had spent. Had I done so, I am sure I would have accepted the £10,000 offered by the edition I used, that of Charles Stonehill, featuring version C. At that time I had not yet learned the lesson all literary critics ought to repeat daily to themselves: the text you are about to interpret has already been interpreted by the editor who established it; are you sure your interpretation does not take for granted a reading that is in fact arguable?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Different copies of Q1—Bodleian (in the Scolar reprint), British Library, Clark, Folger, Huntington (two copies)—show no press variants in the speech. 2 Twelve Famous Plays of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century , ed. Cecil A. Moore, The Modern Library (1933); The Works of George Farquhar , ed. Shirley Strum Kenny, 2 vols. (1988). Professor Kenny has unravelled the complexities of the early editions of The Beaux Stratagem in her introduction to the play ( Works , 2: 148-152); see also her letter to The Times Literary Supplement , 17 September 1971. I have drawn upon her researches for the dates of Q1 and The Comedies of Mr. George Farquhar as well as other details. In addition to my debt to Professor Kenny's work, I wish to record my gratitude to Dr. Nati Krivatsy of The Folger Shakespeare Library, who checked the reading in Folger copies of two editions, to Professors Richard W. F. Kroll and Eugene M. Waith, who checked the Princeton and Yale copies of one edition, to Mr. John Bidwell of the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library for much advice and assistance, and especially to my colleague, Professor A. R. Braunmuller, who patiently checked the reading in a number of the editions cited as well as in many about which I have only generalized. 3 Professor Kenny reports finding no copy of a first edition of The Works Of the late Ingenious Mr. George Farquhar . I assume that first edition to be the Comedies of 1708 because the "second" edition of the Works ("for Bernard Lintott") has a separate title page for the Comedies (for the four booksellers of 1708) similar to that of 1708 and a frontispiece identical to that in 1708. 4 The imprint is anonymous, but the title page bears Thomas Johnson's early device—cattle drinking at a fountain—and motto— non sibi sed omnibus —for which see H. L. Ford, Shakespeare 1700-1740 (1935), 51, 116. 5 The Comedies and the second and third editions of the Works are single-volume octavos. The 1718 fourth edition is a two-volume duodecimo. Its first volume received a fifth edition in 1721, which is sometimes found—as in the Clark copy—uniformly bound with a second volume in the fourth edition of 1718. The edition of 1728 is also a two-volume duodecimo, the first volume being the sixth edition and the second the fifth edition. Only the first volume announces itself as "Corrected," but the second volume was also, as The Beaux Stratagem is included in the second volume of the two-volume editions. 6 The London edition of 1728 prompted a Dublin "edition" in the same year which calls itself The Works Of the late Ingenious Mr. George Farquhar . . . The Sixth Edition . Plays in this "edition" have separate imprints. The Beaux Stratagem in the Yale copy of the "edition" has an imprint of 1729, seems to be the same as the British Library's copy of the separate play printed at Dublin in 1729, and fancifully calls itself an eleventh edition. 7 English Plays 1660-1820 (1935). Morgan notes that his "Text follows O1," which is identified in his sigla as Johnson's edition of 1710. 8 F. J. Tickner omitted Archer's speech in his edition of Restoration Dramatists (1930), but Tickner also omitted many other speeches from the play. His deletion accordingly represents something very different from an editorial solution to a particular crux. 9 Uhler merely lists without explanation his departures from Q1 and may well have arrived at version D independently, although he mentions in his textual introduction some of the early editions, including that of 1728 and the various collections of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. 10 Especially those designating the heirs' portions, which are considerable higher than the social averages.

      <field name="heading_text">Burlington's Library at Chiswick by Philip Ayres</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the documents at Chatsworth House relating to Richard Boyle, third Earl of Burlington (1694-1753), is a manuscript volume titled "A Catalogue of The Earl of Burlington's / Library, / At His Lordships Seat at Cheswick; / January, 1741/2." Many of the books it lists remain together today, no longer at Chiswick but at Chatsworth in Derbyshire, where they form an important part of the Library of the Duke of Devonshire. Historians of architecture know about Burlington's important collection of books on that subject, but no study of the library as a whole, the precise physical disposition of the books within its walls, its historical development, favoured binding-styles, and the ways in which it reflects the range of Burlington's interests, has previously been undertaken. Nor has this library been compared with what is in important respects its antithesis, Timon's library as described in Pope's Epistle to Burlington . Yet the materials that would reward these kinds of inquiries lie readily to hand. In fact one need refer to nothing more than the 1742 Catalogue and the books themselves to analyse in some detail one of the most culturally significant eighteenth-century libraries about which we possess information. 1 The main body of the Catalogue is preceded by an Index and followed at the end by "A Summary Review of some Articles in the foregoing Catalogue." The Index, as the explanatory notes on the title-page point out, is so framed, as to give, at once, a General Idea of y e Whole Disposition. For, as it consists of five Columns, The First of them shews, what Number is fixt upon each Shelf to distinguish it; The Second describes, in what Part of y e Library-Room it stands; The Third, what Volumes may be placed on it [folio, small folio or quarto, or octavo]; The Fourth, Of what Subjects y e Volumes placed on it treat; &amp; The Fifth, on what Page or Pages they are entred. Wch: Pages correspond to y e Index, having y e Number of each Shelf on y e Inner Margin, Their own Number on y e Outer, &amp;, between both, the Running Title denotes y e Subject-Matter of y e Volumes, that are entred under it. The shelves were "fixt to y e Walls in Seven Classes" or bookcases within the Library. According to T. S. Rosoman, this was the room described in the 1770 inventory of Chiswick House as "No. 34 The Closet," on the ground or "Rustic" floor, beneath the Gallery. 2 In the Index the position of each bookcase within the Library is precisely described, with the folio shelves itemised first (these comprised two bookcases each of four shelves exclusively for folios, and the bottom shelf of each of the other five bookcases in this room). The first of the two exclusively folio bookcases stood "next y e Entrance, on y e Left-Hand," the first three of its four shelves (numbered 1-4, always counting from the bottom up) each containing works on architecture, antiquities, and sculpture, with records relating to English history on the fourth. Shelf 5 constituted the bottom shelf of a bookcase (also holding shelves 14-19) that was attached to the wall "between y e Former [bookcase], &amp; y e Hall-Door," and held folios on English history, geography and divinity. Shelf 6, the bottom shelf of a case also housing shelves 20-25 which stood "Between y e Hall-Door, &amp; y e Farther-End," contained folios mainly on English history and geography. Shelf 7, below shelves 26-31, "at y e Farther End, reaching to y e Inner-Door," was largely devoted to folios of English history and poetry, while "between that Door, and y e Chimney" was shelf 8 (surmounted in its bookcase by shelves 32-37) with its folios of Italian miscellanies and a few texts in English and Latin. "Between y e Garden Door, &amp; y e Hither End," at the bottom of a case also containing shelves 38-43, was shelf 9 with its folios on Greek and Roman antiquities. Immediately to the right as one entered the room was another bookcase exclusively for folios, containing four shelves numbered 10-13, devoted to architecture, antiquities and sculpture; Latin miscellanies (history, poetry, geography); French miscellanies (history, geography, antiquities); and more French miscellanies (chiefly history and translations). Shelves 14-19 (in the same case with, and above, shelf 5) held small folios or quartos of English miscellanies—largely history and voyages (shelf 14); and octavos in the shelves above: English miscellanies (shelf 15), English miscellanies mainly divinity (shelf 16), English miscellanies chiefly history, voyages, essays (shelf 17), and more English miscellanies (shelf 18). Shelf 19 was left empty in reserve. Shelves 20-25 (in the same case with, and above, shelf 6) contained small folios or quartos of English miscellanies, mainly history, divinity, and geography (shelf 20); and octavos above: French miscellanies (shelf 21), English miscellanies, including divinity, poetry, geography (shelf 22), English miscellanies, chiefly history and state tracts (shelf 23), and more English miscellanies (shelf 24). Shelf 25 was empty in reserve. Shelves 26-31 (in the same case with, and above, shelf 7) contained small folios or quartos largely of English and Latin poetry, and history (shelf 26); with octavos above: mainly Latin classics on shelf 27, chiefly Latin miscellanies on shelf 28, English miscellanies including tracts by Robert Boyle on shelf 29, bibles and Parliamentary debates on shelf 30, with shelf 31 kept in reserve. Shelves 32-37 (in the same case with, and above, shelf 8) contained small folios of Italian miscellanies including history and poetry (shelf 32); and octavos above: French miscellanies, with a few Italian on shelf 33, architecture, antiquities, and Italian poetry and history on shelf 34, Italian miscellanies including history and poetry on shelf 35, French miscellanies on shelf 36, with shelf 37 in reserve. Shelves 38-43 (in the same case with, and above, shelf 9) contained small folios and quartos of French miscellanies including history and poetry (shelf 38); and octavos, all French miscellanies, above: chiefly history, poetry and novels on shelf 39, mainly memoirs and historical tracts on shelves 40 and 41, mainly memoirs and voyages on shelf 42, with shelf 43 in reserve. For each shelf the Catalogue lists the books in the order, left to right, in which they stood on that shelf. If one had the original bookcases it would therefore be perfectly possible, theoretically, to put the bookcases and all of the books Burlington had at Chiswick in January 1742 back precisely where they then were. Within this room, in addition to the bookcases, there were four library tables containing shelves on which stood a wide range of titles, including many devoted to views of places in France, Italy and other countries. Tables A, B and D were of moderate size, each holding a dozen or fewer titles; table C, considerably larger, held thirty-one titles. There were also, in the Circular Room at the west end of the Gallery, two bookcases of two shelves each for large folios of mixed subject matter. For convenience, some shelves included a number of books which were not strictly part of that class. These titles were included in the "Summary Review of some Articles in the foregoing Catalogue" at the end, which in effect provided them with a supplementary index of their own. When for any reason a book was removed from one shelf to another, the new location was pencilled in alongside the original entry, a procedure underway when the Catalogue was made and noted in its explanatory notes on the title-page. For printed works the Catalogue normally gives, in addition to the title, the place and date of publication. It is curious that while the Catalogue has ample space for additions, it lists no title published after 1742, though numerous books published subsequent to that date certainly entered the Library over the final eleven years of Burlington's life. It is almost as though he wished the Catalogue to define his Library at a fixed time. On some occasion or occasions during those last eleven years he personally noted, on both sides of two sheets of paper which lie loosely inside the front cover, the details of forty-two titles—seventy volumes—which he added to his Chiswick Library after the composition of the Catalogue, specifying the number of volumes if more than one, and the place and date of publication. 3 These titles and volumes are taken into account here, but in a number of the statistics they are distinguished as bracketed figures so that the primary analysis is of the Library as it existed in January 1742. It should also be noted that the two sheets of paper list only a fraction of the volumes that Burlington purchased subsequent to the composition of the Catalogue. For instance, on the same day in 1747 he acquired a 1567 edition of Labacco's L'Achitettura and a second copy of the 1601 Venice edition of Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura , inscribing on both title-pages "Burlington March 24 1746" (1747). The books are now at Chatsworth, but Burlington did not include them on either of the sheets listing additions to the Chiswick Library, though he did list the acquisition of two additional copies of the 1616 Venice edition of Palladio. Perhaps he noted the 1567 Labacco and the second copy of the 1601 Palladio on other sheets of paper that have disappeared, or transferred these volumes to his library at Londesborough in Yorkshire, where he almost certainly kept important works on architecture for reference whenever he was in residence there. This would also account for the fact that only two of his three copies of the first, 1570, edition of Palladio are listed in the Chiswick catalogue, though he had acquired his third copy in June of 1739. 4 The Catalogue lists approximately 1318 [+42] titles in some 1942 [+70] volumes, including a few manuscript titles. 5 Burlington's several trips to France and two tours of Italy represented in the world of action interests reflected in a library with a relatively heavy proportion of books in French and Italian—in fact fewer than 50 per cent of the titles represent works in English. Of all titles, including those Burlington added after January 1742, 675, or 49.63 per cent, are of books in English or translations into English (this includes books with Latin titles but whose texts are in English); 339, or 24.93 per cent, are of books in French; 194, or 14.26 per cent, are of books in Italian; 146, or 10.74 per cent, are Latin texts; and 6, or 0.44 per cent, are in other languages. These last include four bibles, two in "Irish" (Burlington owned estates in Ireland, which presumably accounts for the interest reflected by these), one in Hebrew, and one in "Indian." Greek authors were represented in translations. In Pope's Epistle to Burlington (1731), Timon's library is said to exclude anything recently published—"These shelves admit not any modern book." 6 By contrast, of the books that sat on the shelves of Burlington's Chiswick Library in January 1742, some 83.06 per cent were under 100 years old. 7 More than half, 52.63 per cent, were less than fifty years old, and most of these must certainly have been acquired by Burlington himself. Many of the 16.94 per cent that were a hundred or more years old were important editions of Italian and French texts on architecture, purchased by Burlington for their historical importance or simply for his professional use, rather than display, though his fondness for Palladio led him to indulge in the purchase of multiple copies of significant editions. There was not a single incunabulum, though Burlington's post-January 1742 additions include one of great importance—"Leo Battista Alberti Florentia 1485 / Shelf 2," that is, the first edition of Alberti's De re aedificatoria . 8 This was still a dynamic library in 1742--some 10.5 per cent of the titles had been published in the past ten years, 6.3 per cent in the past five--and, as evidence below will show, it remained dynamic through the 1740s as significant texts in architecture and other fields continued to be added. It is unclear what proportion of the Library had been inherited by Burlington. His father, Charles Boyle, died in 1704. Few of the volumes at Chiswick seem to have borne his name, to judge from the limited number I have physically examined. One of them, a copy of William Wycherley's Miscellany Poems (London, 1704), was a gift of the author's, who inscribed it "For y e Hon, ble Charles Boyle Esq / from, / his most oblidg'd and most humble servant, W. Wycherley." Only occasionally did Burlington autograph his own books, though most of the important works on architecture bear his signature and often a date. It was these architectural texts, naturally, which represented the cream of Burlington's collection, with the Palladios, the Vitruvii, and the 1485 Alberti the crème de la crème . The Chiswick Catalogue lists twelve copies of Palladio, most of them in Italian. Among them were two of Burlington's three copies of the first (Venice) edition of 1570. The first of the three 1570s he only acquired at the beginning of 1729, almost a decade after his pilgrimage to Vicenza to study Palladio's work at first hand towards the end of 1719. His consolation for having waited so long was that this copy was (and remains) pristine. He signed it "Burlington Jan:22. 1728" (1729), and had it bound in his favoured rich-brown russia, gilt border, diamond-shaped gilt decoration to the centre of the covers, all edges gilt (Plate I). Just twenty-four days later, on 15 February 1728/9, he signed and dated his second copy. He had to wait over ten more years for his third, which he inscribed on 16 June 1739. His very first Palladio, a 1601 Venice edition, had been acquired at Vicenza during his visit there in 1719 (inscribed on a slip of paper pasted onto the front top of the blank sheet preceding the title-page, "Vicenza Nov: 3-1719 Burlington"). This well-known copy is interleaved with blank pages used by Burlington to make notes on Palladio's buildings. 9 Other Palladios have inscriptions dated 11 November 1735 (Venice edition, 1616; Paris edition, 1650), 22 March 1741/2 (Venice edition, 1642), and 24 March 1746/7 (Venice edition, 1601). Another is signed but undated (Venice edition, 1581). A 1580 Palladio printed at Bordeaux has the autograph of "Baluzius," the controversial French historian Etienne Baluze (1630-1718). Being an octavo, it was separated from most of the other Palladios, at shelf 28. The nine copies of Vitruvius's de Architectura listed in the Chiswick Catalogue include three items of particular interest: a late manuscript; the Ioconda edition printed in Venice in 1511 (the earliest printed Vitruvius in Burlington's possession); and Inigo Jones's well-known annotated copy of Daniele Barbaro's 1567 Venice edition. Among the others is an edition of 1521 (place of publication unspecified in the Chiswick Catalogue), a Perugia edition of 1536, Barbaro's Venice editions of 1556, 1569 (Catalogue reads "156-") and 1629, and an Elzevir edition published in Amsterdam in 1649. Burlington, however, could not compete in Vitruvii with another architect earl, Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford (1689-1741), who possessed three manuscripts of Vitruvius including what is now Harleian ms. 2767, the earliest and best of all the manuscripts of the de Architectura , dating from the eighth century. 10 In addition to Alberti, Palladio, and Vitruvius, architectural history was represented at Chiswick by significant and less significant editions of Serlio (1551, 1568, 1569, 1600, all published at Venice); Scamozzi (1583, 1615, both Venice), Vignola (Rome, 1617, and another at Rome undated in Catalogue), Barbaro (Venice, 1569), Rusconi (Venice, 1660), Francini (Paris, 1640), Bullant (Paris, 1568), Delorme (Paris, 1568), Blondel (Paris, 1675/83), Desgodetz (Paris, 1682), and others. There were also some important English works, including John Shute's extremely rare First and Chief Groundes of Architecture (1563), William Kent's Designs of Inigo Jones (1727--supervised by Burlington, who owned the drawings), Robert Castell's pioneering Villas of the Ancients (1728, also influenced by Burlington), Isaac Ware's Designs of Inigo Jones (1735, but undated in the Catalogue; like Kent and Castell, Ware was a Burlington protégé), and Burlington's own Fabbriche Antiche disegnate da Andrea Palladio (1730), listed in the Catalogue as "Therme Antiche di Palladio," without date. Of Colin Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus only the third volume (1725) appears in the Catalogue. Isaac Ware's superb English edition of Palladio, based on the 1570 Venice edition, dedicated to Burlington and published in 1738, was of course at Chiswick, along with a volume consisting of the plates of this without the text, and yet another by Ware containing just the first book of Palladio (1742). Some of the apparently odd omissions, such as Campbell's first and second volumes, or Leoni's lavish but not particularly faithful English edition of Palladio (which began to appear in 1716, and was not much liked by Burlington), may be plausibly accounted for if one assumes a working library at Londesborough. There are complete copies of Campbell and Leoni at Chatsworth. Intimately related to Burlington's architectural interests and practice was his enthusiasm for archeology—first and foremost the archeology of ancient Rome, which informed the work of Palladio, but also the archeology of Roman Britain, which produced important works of scholarship in the 1720s and 1730s and probably helped to stimulate the development of a purer classicism in the work of Burlington himself, his disciple Kent and others. This enthusiasm accounts for approximately forty titles in the Catalogue, including among others Johannes Giorgius Graevius's twelve-volume Thesaurus Antiquitatum Graecarum and Jacobus Gronovius's thirteen-volume Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanarum (both Venice, 1732-37) with the five volumes of supplements by Giovanni Poleni (Venice, 1737), Albert Henri de Sallengre's three-volume Novus Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanarum (Venice, 1735), Bonaventura van Overbeke's three-volume Les Restes del'ancienne Rome (Amsterdam, 1709), Sextus Julius Frontinus's De Aquaeductibus Urbis Romae Commentarius (Patavia, 1722), Famiano Nardini's Roma Antica (Rome, 1704), Joseph Marie Suares's Praeneste Antiqua , Palladio's collection of Antiquitates Urbis Romae (Oxford, 1709), two editions of Etienne du Perac's I Vestigi dell'Antichità di Roma (Rome, 1575 and 1653), Lucio Fauno's Delle Antichità della Città di Roma (Venice, 1548), Pirro Ligorio's Delle Antichità di Roma (Venice, 1555), Antoine Desgodetz's Les Edifices antiques de Rome (Paris, 1682), Jean Poldo D'Albenas's Discours historial de l'antique et l'illustre Cité de Nismes (Lyon, 1560), Hubert Goltz's Sicilia et Magna Graecia (Antwerp, 1618), Friderik Ludvig Norden's Drawings of Some Ruins and Colossal Statues at Thebes in Egypt (London, 1741), Vincenzo Mirabella e Alagonas's Dichiarazioni della Pianta dell'antiche Siracuse (Naples, 1613), and, indicating Burlington's interest in a newly-developing area of studies, Francesco Gori's Musaeum Etruscum in two volumes (Florence, 1737). Castell's Villas of the Ancients (1728), already noticed, charts previously unexplored archeological territory under Burlington's influence. Romano-British archeology was represented by, among others, Holland's translation of Camden's Britannia (1610) and Gibson's updated edition of 1695, Alexander Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale (1726), John Horsley's great Britannia Romana (1732), and Francis Drake's Eboracum (1736--dedicated to Burlington, and with hand-coloured plates in the presentation copy). As a practising architect Burlington required the tools of the trade, and just as he patronised the best watchmaker of his generation, George Graham, so he bought his mathematical instruments from the best maker, Jonathan Sisson. On 15 February 1721 his accounts book for the period 1719-22 records the payment "To M r - Sisson for a Silver Case of Mathematical Instruments £12.12." These were immediately put to heavy use, for a year later, on 14 February 1722, a payment was recorded "To M r - Sisson for an Ivory Rule &amp; cleaning some Mathematical Instruments £1.6." 11 At Chiswick, under "ye Nearest Window in ye Circular Room," four titles in from the left on the lower shelf, stood (according to the Catalogue) "Stone's Construction &amp; Uses of Mathem 1 Instruments London 1723." The point of mentioning Burlington's good taste in mathematical instruments as well as this book on the subject is to illustrate the connectedness of theory and practice here (something that needs no demonstration in regard to the works on architecture). Other books at Chiswick reflected Burlington's interest in astronomy and scientific developments, and by reference to the account books the practical use to which he put at least one of these can be demonstrated too, the work listed in the Catalogue as "Long's Astronomy Vol 1st." Roger Long ( c. 1680-1770) was an English astronomer who worked hard to popularise the science. Burlington's possession of this volume holds added interest when we learn that he purchased a telescope on or before 16 September 1747, the date on which his personal accounts book reveals a payment "to Ecclestone for a Telescope [£]7-17-06." 12 Burlington owned a copy of Newton's Optics (1704), and was no doubt familiar with the fact that Eccleston made his reflecting telescopes "after Sir Isaac Newton's form." 13 Burlington's interest in science was understandable given the family connection with the chemist and philosopher Robert Boyle (1627-91), the brother of Burlington's paternal great grandfather, and not surprisingly the Catalogue lists twenty-three of Boyle's publications. His complete works (1744) were also purchased by Burlington, though they were not included in his notes of additions to the Catalogue (Burlington's copy of the complete works is now at Chatsworth). One of the additions he did list was "Watsons observations on Electricity," which, together with his purchase of a telescope, his possession of "Squire on the Longitude," and his interest in Etruscan studies, indicates how up-to-date Burlington remained in the last years of his life. In Timon's library, "For Locke or Milton 'tis in vain to look," modern philosophy and literature holding no interest for him. Again Timon's antithesis is Burlington, who possessed editions of Locke's Essay on Human Understanding (1710, two volumes) and his Letters to the Bishop of Worcester (1697, two volumes). Another significant modern work in the philosophical field was Shaftesbury's Characteristics , represented at Chiswick in a three-volume edition of 1723. Timon's exclusion of Locke and Milton excuses an out-of-place consideration of Burlington's Miltons together with his Lockes. Chiswick housed the Poetical Works in quarto (undated in the Catalogue), the Iconoclastes (Amsterdam, 1690), the Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda (1654), even an Italian Paradise Lost , "Il Paradiso perduto di Milton, tradott da Rolli Londra 1735." Before passing from science and philosophy to music and literature one should notice editions of Belon's L'Histoire de la Nature des Oyseaux (Paris, 1555), Bacon's Natural History (1658) and Advancement of Learning (1674), Newton's Optics (1704), Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica (two volumes, 1707, 1725), the first edition of Chambers's Universal History of Arts and Sciences (1728), Catesby's Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands (1731), the Catalogue of Foreign and Exotic Plants (1730), Albin's Natural History of Birds (two volumes, 1731), Bradley's Botanic Lectures in manuscript, and Clare's Motion of Fluids, Natural and Artificial (1737). Burlington's greatest achievement was to oversee the development of English Palladianism, but he was also renowned as a patron of literature and friend of poets, most notably Pope and Gay, and as a leading force in the organisation of Italian opera in England. For some time Handel lived and composed under his roof. In view of his strong musical interests, one might expect the Catalogue to reveal larger holdings in music than it does. Scattered among the "Italian Miscellanies; Hist. Poetry, Archit. Antiq s . &amp;c" on shelf 35 were some musical items including Nichola Haym's libretto Teseo (1713) for Handel's opera of that name (Haym dedicated it to Burlington), Tasso's Aminta , the selected works of Carlo Pallavicino, and Rolli's Porsenna , but there was no shelf in the Library devoted to music. It is very likely that Burlington kept his printed music in a music room and catalogued it separately, if he catalogued it at all. By contrast, his strong literary interests were well-reflected in the Library. Predictably, the most heavily-represented poet was Pope, with over twenty volumes including the Essay on Man (Catalogue omits date of edition), the Dunciad of 1729, various editions of the Works (1717, 1730, 1735, 1736), the Letters (1737, 1741), the Epistle to Burlington (1731, presentation copy--there was also an uncatalogued early manuscript of this, now at Chatsworth), the Epistle to Bathurst (1733), the Imitation of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace (1734) and others, but not individual editions of the Essay on Criticism , the Rape of the Lock or anything else pre-dating Pope's friendship with Burlington. Pope aside, English literature included two editions of Spenser's Works (1679, 1715), Theobald's edition of Shakespeare's Works (1740) though not Pope's (Burlington chose well), a collected works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1711), Bacon's Essays (1625), Jonson's Bartholomew Fair, The Staple of News (both 1631) and the Works (1640), the Miltons already noticed, Browne's Religio Medici (1656), Waller's Poems (1711) and Works (1729), Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel and other works ("in sev 1 years"), his Fables (1700) and translations of Virgil, Juvenal and Persius (all 1697), Wycherley's Miscellany Poems (1704), Congreve's Works (1710), Swift's Tale of a Tub (1704) and Works (1735?), Steele's Guardian (1714), Addison's Freeholder (1716), Prior's Poems (1709, 1718), Gay's Trivia ("17--" in the Catalogue--1716), Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Captain Singleton (1720), Thomson's Seasons (1730) and Cibber's Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber (1740). There was also a great deal of French and Italian literature, including Montaigne's Essays (London, 1724), collected works of Corneille (Paris, 1657, 1664), Racine (Paris, 1682), and Moliere (Paris, 1730, 1734), a Petrarch (Venice, 1531), an Opere of Boccaccio (Florence, 1723), Castiglione's Il Cortegiano (Venice, 1528), Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (Lyon, 1556; Venice, 1584), Trissino's Italia Liberata (Rome, 1545), his Sophonisba (Venice, 1549), Dialogo and Epistola (both Vicenza, 1529) and his collected Opere (Verona, 1729), Guarini's Il Pastor Fido (Paris, 1650; Verona, 1735), Tasso's Gierusalemme Liberata (Genoa, 1617 and London, 1724) and Amadigi (Venice, 1583), and much French and Italian literature besides. It is perhaps unnecessary to itemise selected works of significance within every category when the Catalogue may be consulted on request at Chatsworth, and for the remainder of this paper I intend merely to notice a few general and distinguishing features of the Library there. Strong areas besides those already noticed included history (with remarkable strengths in modern French history) and geography, and in these fields Burlington's interests ranged very widely. For instance, in addition to his many works on British and Continental history Burlington possessed Du Halde's four-volume Description de la Chine (Paris, 1735), Knox's Historical Relation of Ceylon (1681), Rycaut's Present State of the Ottoman Empire (1668), Knolles's History of the Turks with Rycaut's continuation (1687/1700), Savage's two-volume Abridgement of the History of the Turks (1701), Ockley's two-volume History of the Saracens (1718), A Discourse on the Original of the Cossacks (1671), Morgan's Complete History of Algiers (1728), and a large amount of voyage literature in both English and French. The library was also rich in books of views of places in France, Italy and elsewhere. Works on antiquities naturally concentrated on Italy, but Burlington was also interested in the collections of his contemporaries in England and owned a copy of The Marble Antiquities of the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton (1731). This field represented just one aspect of his general archeological enthusiasm, reflected in his patronage of Castell's Villas of the Ancients (1728) and Drake's Eboracum (1736), and in his possession of titles whose subjects might at first sight seem remote, such as Du Choul's La Castramentation et Discipline Militaire des Romains (Lyon, 1595). There is no reason to comment on the large number of Greek and particularly Roman authors in what is in this respect a typical eighteenth-century library, except perhaps to note a comparatively large number of classical texts in French translation and the absence of texts in Greek. There was also a significant collection of Elzevirs, fourteen titles in thirty-two volumes mostly of Roman authors, kept together on shelf 27 and all published between 1625 and 1645 at Leyden with the exception of a 1659 Seneca in four volumes from Amsterdam. Whether Burlington was as proud of his Elzevirs as Timon was of his Aldine printings is matter for speculation. He probably was, given that most of his Elzevirs came from Leyden. In the eighteenth century, connoisseurs considered Leyden Elzevirs the only ones worth having. Divinity, like classics, is an area where one expects to find a heavy concentration in an eighteenth-century library, and Burlington's collection was no exception. The leading deists seem to have been excluded. On the other hand Butler's Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed (1736), the most influential refutation of deism, was admitted. The Arianiser William Whiston's sermons were presumably included only because Burlington made a point of buying published sermons which had been delivered at the annual Boyle lectures. Much of the controversial material consists of attacks on Roman Catholicism, with very little representation of the Catholic position. Burlington owned copies of the Sermons de Jean Calvin (Geneva, 1561) and Luther's Table-Talk (1652). Something should be said in a general way about the bindings of the books in the Library at Chiswick. The first thing to notice is the apparent absence of any serious interest in collecting significant historical bindings, something that appealed to Timon, who was especially fond of the work of Du Sueil, and to whom the physical book--its printer, its binder--mattered far more than its contents ("In Books, not Authors, curious is my Lord"). By contrast, Burlington's tastes were certainly reflected in the contents of the volumes in his library. At the same time he was a man of impeccable and studied taste in every detail of his life and work, from the houses he designed to the mathematical instruments he used to design them, and one expects and finds a style of considerable elegance in the bindings of his books. It is not at all surprising to discover that many of them were bound by Thomas Elliott, also binder to the Harleian Library. 14 Burlington's bindings may be studied with particular regard to his books on architecture and archeology, since these represented favoured fields and presumably received attention to their bindings second to none. A number of items in these categories are illustrated in the Plates. Generally, Burlington favoured a rich mid-brown russia (also used on the top of his desk 15 ) and sometimes an orange-red morocco, marbled end-papers, richly gilt borders, covers sometimes pannelled on books that entered the library prior to the late-1720s, usually not on books acquired after, with ornate lozenge-shaped gilt decoration occasionally applied to the centre of unpannelled covers, and edges often gilt. A fine example of a late-1720s Burlington binding by Thomas Elliott is what must have been one of the most prized books in the collection, Burlington's first and extremely fine copy of the first (Venice, 1570) edition of Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (Plate 1), in russia. This was probably bound shortly after its purchase on or about 22 January 1729, the date when he signed it. His second 1570 Palladio, inscribed 15 February 1729, he also had bound in russia. The third, inscribed on 16 June 1739, he left in the vellum binding in which it presumably came to him. Plate 2 shows, at top-left, in an Elliott binding, the 1580 octavo Palladio published in Bordeaux bearing the autograph of "Baluzius." Burlington did not record the date when it entered his library. The volume at top-right is Nichola Haym's libretto for Handel's Teseo . It was published in 1713, and because it was dedicated to Burlington one may safely assume it entered his library in that year or the next and is therefore one of the very earliest of the Burlington bindings. Its pannelled design is correct for the period and sets it apart from a Burlington binding of the late-1730s illustrated at bottom-left, Francis Lynch's comedy The Independent Patriot (1737), again dedicated to Burlington. At bottom-right is a work by Henry Aldrich (1647-1710), the undated part-manuscript Elementorum Architecturae, pars prima , probably bound in the late 1720s or 1730s, also by Elliott. Unfortunately the volumes of Burlington's accounts held at Chatsworth do not record regular payments to Elliott or anyone else for the binding of books, or for that matter payments for books. Presumably payments were made directly by Burlington and never recorded in formal books of accounts. I could find only two entries relating to bookbinding. One entry was made on 23 May 1720: "To M r - Steph: Bolton Book-binder for a large Porto-folio in red Maroquin, Gilded &amp; for other Books (ask Recet) . . . £4.19." It seems from a separate entry that the "Porto-folio" was of Prior's Works . The bindings on the Priors I examined at Chatsworth were not typical of Burlington bindings. 16 The other entry was made on 15 August 1750, recording a payment of ten shillings and sixpence "to James for y e binding of Pompeo," a work unrecorded by Burlington on his two sheets of post-January 1742 additions. 17 The majority of the books in Burlington's Chiswick Library in 1742 seem still to have been at Chiswick in 1813 when a new Catalogue for the Library there was completed, though I have not exhaustively compared the two catalogues. A large number of those books which remained at Chiswick in 1813 were subsequently sold, either before or after they left Chiswick for Chatsworth, but certainly before the composition of the current two-volume Chatsworth Catalogue compiled earlier this century. Moreover, a considerable number of those that were listed in the current Chatsworth Catalogue have subsequently been sold, some in the 1970s and others as recently as 1981-82. Fortunately the crucial architectural core of Burlington's Chiswick Library remains intact at Chatsworth, along with a great number of his most valuable books in other categories. These should enable interested scholars to explore aspects of Burlington's Library beyond those examined here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I would like to thank the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, and in particular His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, for permitting me to examine Burlington's library at first-hand in the Library at Chatsworth. I am also grateful to the Keeper of Collections at Chatsworth, Mr Peter Day, for his valued assistance. 2 Rosoman provides a description of the rooms and their uses in the eighteenth century. See his article "The Decoration and Use of the Principal Apartments of Chiswick House, 1727-70," The Burlington Magazine , CXXVII, Number 991 (October, 1985), 663-667, particularly p. 676 and n. 75, but with this compare p. 675. 3 The writing is in Burlington's distinctive hand. In a few instances he noted the shelf on which he had placed the title, and its format—"8vo," "4to," etc. 4 Rudolf Wittkower counts four at Chatsworth, but on my count there are only three. See Chapter Six, "English Neo-classicism and the Vicissitudes of Palladio's Quattro Libri ," in Wittkower's Palladio and Palladianism (1974), p. 85. 5 While I have taken care to check the sums, all figures, given human fallibility, should be taken as approximate. 6 Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington , l. 140, from the Twickenham edn. of The Poems of Alexander Pope , III.ii, Epistles to Several Persons , ed. F. W. Bateson (1951; ed. cit., 1961), p. 151. 7 Statistics on the age of the books in Burlington's Chiswick Library are based on the dates given in the Catalogue and generally represent titles rather than volumes, except that whenever multiple dates are specified in the Catalogue for multiple-volume works (something that was not done consistently), each given date is represented. This procedure is inevitably something of a compromise, though it affects the figures very little. 8 Burlington may have possessed two copies of this. The Catalogue lists, on shelf two, "Alberti, De Re Ædificatoria Florentia 1-85." 9 Some of these notes are quoted by James Lees-Milne in his section on Burlington in Earls of Creation: Five Great Patrons of Eighteenth-Century Art (1962). 10 On this matter and a range of connections between Burlington and Vitruvius see my recent article, "Pope's Epistle to Burlington : the Vitruvian Analogies," Studies in English Literature , 30 (1990), 429-444. 11 Jonathan Sisson (1690-1749) was an eminent instrument-maker, from April 1729 Instrument Maker to the Prince of Wales. His work is discussed in E. G. R. Taylor, The Mathematical Practitioners of Hanoverian England (1966), pp. 143-144. See also Nicholas Goodison, English Barometers 1680-1860 (1977), pp. 242-243. The accounts book, containing the joint accounts of Richard Graham and Jacob Collier, is at Chatsworth. The same book reveals Burlington's patronage of George Graham and the silversmith Anthony Nelme. 12 Personal accounts book, green vellum binding, at Chatsworth. 13 On Eccleston see Taylor, Mathematical Practitioners , p. 230. Burlington's purchase of one of Eccleston's instruments enables Taylor's entry to be updated from "fl. 1751" to "fl. 1747-51." 14 A number of Elliott's tools may be identified on the bindings illustrated in the two plates. Of those illustrated in Plate 15 of Howard Nixon, "Harleian bindings," Studies in the Book Trade in Honour of Graham Pollard (1975), tools 2 and 10, for instance, are found on the binding illustrated at the top-left of Plate II here; tool 19 is found on the binding illustrated on the bottom-right of the same plate; and compare tool 1 with the similar tool in the lozenge area of the binding illustrated on Plate I. Compare, too, the outer roll and the wave-pattern roll in the border of the binding illustrated by Nixon on his Plate 11 with the outer roll and the wave-pattern roll in the border of the binding illustrated on my Plate I. A more detailed analysis of the Burlington bindings will be the subject of a separate article still in preparation. 15 See illustration 15 in Rosoman, "The Decoration and Use of the Principal Apartments of Chiswick House, 1727-70," p. 673. 16 Accounts book for the period 1719-22, at Chatsworth.

      <field name="heading_text">Samuel Johnson's Proposals for the Harleian Miscellany by O M Brack, Jr. and Mary Early</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Harley, first Earl of Oxford (of the second creation)—chancellor of the exchequer, then lord treasurer, and head of the Tory ministry under Queen Anne, friend and patron of Pope and Swift—and his son Edward Harley, the second earl, were among the greatest English collectors of books and manuscripts. Their collection "was among the glories of their age," as W. P. Courtney writes; "in the recollection of the Harleian manuscripts, the Harleian library, and the Harleian Miscellany , the family name will never die." 1 The manuscripts eventually became the property of the nation and are in the British Library; the catalogue of the manuscripts, begun in 1708 by Lord Oxford's librarian, the pioneer medievalist Humfrey Wanley, is itself a monumental work. The Harleian books, however, were sold after the death of the second earl in 1741 to the bookseller Thomas Osborne, who engaged Samuel Johnson and William Oldys, literary secretary to the earl from 1738 to 1741, to prepare a catalogue of the collection to attract possible purchasers. For the Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae , published between 1743 and 1745, Johnson wrote "An Account of the Harleian Library," which first appeared in the proposals and later introduced the catalogue, contributed the preface to the third volume, and provided annotations to some of the entries. As part of his scheme to recoup his investment in the Harleian library, Osborne reprinted, in eight quarto volumes, the texts of a selection of its political and religious pamphlets of the sixteenth and seventeenth century—the famous Harleian Miscellany , still a highly useful source for the student of the period. As with the catalogue, Johnson and Oldys collaborated in editing it. For the Harleian Miscellany , published from 24 March 1744 through 25 March 1746, Johnson wrote "An Account of this Undertaking," which was included in the proposals; contributed an introduction, later entitled "An Essay on the Origin and Importance of Small Tracts and Fugitive Pieces," printed in the first volume; and provided prefaces to at least ten pamphlets. The publication and textual history of "An Account of this Undertaking" is complex. The earliest printing of the proposals for the Harleian Miscellany , published 30 December 1743, survives in a unique copy in Chetham's Library, Manchester (A). 2 On 4 January 1744 the proposals were among the preliminaries of the third volume of Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae (B) and later in the month were printed as a final leaf to volume 13 of the Gentleman's Magazine (C). In mid-April the proposals were again issued separately (D) and also, on 19 April, appeared in the London Evening Post (E). The blue wrappers to individual parts of John Smith's Memoirs of Wool (F), Robert James's Medicinal Dictionary (G), and the Harleian Miscellany (H) also contained the proposals. 3 The proposal housed in Chetham's Library, probably set from Johnson's manuscript of the "Account," serves as the ultimate source for subsequent printings. It is an unsigned gathering of two leaves: page one contains the title and conditions, pages two and three "An Account of this Undertaking," and page four is blank. Page three is largely filled with four columns of "Heads," i.e. subject headings according to which the tracts will be organized. 4 After its publication on 30 December 1743, changes and corruptions in the text began almost immediately. The copy of the proposals in the Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae , published 4 January 1744, was set from the copy of 30 December, retaining even its layout. Several small changes occur such as "Genious" for "Genius," "increase" for "encrease" and (in the "Conditions") "T. Osborne" for "Thomas Osborne." More notable is an omission from the first condition, which proposed to publish "on the same Letter and Paper with these Proposals." Since the Harleian Miscellany was not to appear on the same paper as this version of the proposal, the phrase "and Paper" was left out, producing a nonsensical condition: "on the same Letter with these Proposals." The proposals which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine in late January 1744 were also set from the 30 December text, as evidenced by the inclusion of "Thomas Osborne" and "and Paper," even though this was not the paper to be used, either. Among the small changes proving significant later, in the first condition "these Proposals" become "the Proposals," in the third condition "Gray's Inn" becomes "Gray's-Inn" and "on Ludgate-Hill" becomes "on Ludgate-Street," and in the first paragraph "Public" becomes "Publick." The proposals issued separately in mid-April 1744 again follow the 30 December text, since they contain the readings "Thomas Osborne" and "Ludgate-hill." Several changes occur in this text, the most important being the exclusion of the last two paragraphs and the list of headings; two notes, neither by Johnson, have been added. 5 In addition, this text is the first to read "was published" instead of "will be published," to give the contents of the first four numbers of the Harleian Miscellany , and to provide a list of subscribers. The proposals appearing in the 19 April London Evening Post follow the proposals in the Gentleman's Magazine : both have the readings "the Proposals," "Gray's-Inn," "Ludgate-Street," and "Publick." Of four changes in the text, only one is noteworthy: in referring to the list of headings, the passage "is such as if they could be conveniently publish'd, would excite" replaces "cannot but excite." 6 The proposals continued to be published on the blue wrappers for the individual parts of a variety of works. A chance few have survived from among what may have been numerous printings. A wrapper for James's Medicinal Dictionary , which lists the contents for the first ten numbers of the Harleian Miscellany and the subscribers, seems to follow (D). 7 The wrapper for Smith's Memoirs of Wool , which lists the contents for the ninth number of volume four of the Harleian Miscellany , follows (C). 8 The proposals were also printed on the wrappers of the parts of the Harleian Miscellany , but the only known copy has disappeared. According to J. D. Fleeman, the "Conditions" in this copy followed (D). 9 The proposals underwent numerous additions, deletions, and corruptions in their several printings. The majority of the changes appear in the conditions and notes, with surprisingly few differences in Johnson's "An Account of this Undertaking." Apart from the deletion of the list of headings and two paragraphs, only a few unimportant changes in punctuation and spelling occur. Because of an almost unprecedented absence of corruption in the text, the one substantive revision in the "Account" found in the London Evening Post has an increased significance. Unfortunately, it cannot be attributed to Johnson with any certainty because of its stylistic neutrality. Because the deletions and revisions in the printings after the first do not reveal any intervention by Johnson, the only authoritative text for an edition of the "Account" is the first printing.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Hume's Revisions of the History of England by Graeme Slater</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hume (David), the Historian", is the entry under which Hume's works are catalogued in the British Library. The History of England appeared between 1754 and 1762, and it was this work, rather than the philosophical writings, which provided the foundation of Hume's reputation for the next century. In the first half of the nineteenth century the History was clearly a canonical text; thus the Quarterly Review 46 (1832) paid tribute to the inviolable status of the work. For the Quarterly , the History "has taken its place as the classical record, and can no more be supplanted by anything else on the same subject than Macbeth, or the Paradise Lost, or the Dunciad" (6). In the view of the Quarterly , the English polity and the History were interrelated, and a historiographical revolution which would displace Hume was inconceivable—inconceivable both in terms of the English political system and the economics of the market place: "To drive Hume out of the market is impossible. The nation is no more disposed to welcome a new history than a new constitution" (6). Up to, and perhaps even beyond, the publication of the first two volumes of Macaulay's History in 1849, Hume's remained the definitive history of England. However, Hume's work had not been an immediate success, and the "definitive" edition of the History of England of 1778, posthumously incorporating Hume's final revisions, was a rather different work from the first version of the History of Great Britain under the House of Stuart . The History emerged in various stages. The first quarto volume of the History of Great Britain , covering the period 1603-1649, was published in 1754; this volume, dealing as it did with the most hotly disputed reigns of English history, provoked a great deal of controversy. A quarto volume on the reigns of the later Stuarts appeared at the end of 1756. Hume then proceeded to write the history of the Tudors, two quarto volumes on the period 1485-1603 being published in 1759. Also in 1759 appeared a revised edition of the Stuart volumes. Two quarto volumes covering the period from the Roman landings in England to the reigns of the Tudors were published in 1761. 1 A uniform quarto edition of the History of England came out in 1762; this was followed by octavo editions in 1763, 1767, 1770 and 1773. 2 Hume's final revisions were incorporated in the posthumous edition of 1778. Thereafter, until the end of the nineteenth century, the History was reprinted and reshaped according to the designs of numerous editors. 3 The significance of Hume's revisions to the History has rarely been discussed in detail. 4 The scale alone of the revisions demands attention. In a comparison of the volume published in 1754 and the parallel portions of the 1778 edition I have traced 2692 alterations. 5 Obviously this figure can only serve as an indication of the scale of the changes: the omission of several pages or the alteration of "pretext" to "pretence" equally count as a single "alteration". 6 Nonetheless, Hume did perceive himself as engaged in a continuous process of rewriting which was as creative as the original composition. For Hume, the continued exertion of authorial power over the History was imperative. In his famous and dramatic interview of 7 July 1776 with the dying Hume, Boswell attempted to extort from the historian an expression of regret at having to "leave" "such an admirable history": "[Hume] said, 'I shall leave that history, of which you are pleased to speak so favourably, as perfect as I can.' . . . He said he became a greater friend to the Stuart family as he advanced in studying for his history; and he hoped he had vindicated the two first of them so effectually that they would never again be attacked." 7 "As perfect as I can": the labour of Hume's last fifteen years was indeed to bring the History to something like perfection. Hume was fascinated by the power that print gave him over his text, and took an undeniable pleasure in the activity of revision—or "correction", as he preferred to call it. 8 A study of the revisions ipso facto deals with what changes in the course of the various editions of the History ; but, of course, what remains the same is also significant and instructive. Thus there are few alterations to Hume's great set-piece of the execution of Charles I, or to the account of the Reformation which he gave in the Tudor volumes; he appears to have been satisfied with these parts of the narrative, and content to let them pass through various editions virtually unaltered. 9 The significance of the revisions is to show the process of Hume's struggle with sometimes intractable material, and his response to criticism. In this study I intend both to draw attention to the more significant textual variants of the History and to place them in the context of Hume's response to criticism and his developing understanding of the work. I will consider first the revisions entailed by Hume's discoveries of new sources of historical information, and then deal with some of his revisionary restructurings of narrative and character. However, the main focus of this article will be upon the revisions which relate to the aspects of the History to which certain of Hume's contemporaries took violent exception—the work's treatment of revealed religion and of the politics of the reigns of the early Stuarts. Hume's composition of the History has traditionally been associated with an image of sloth, with the historian "working" on his text in a relaxed, not to say casual, posture. 10 However, he did in fact continue to read and, within limits, research. Hume adds information on economic affairs to the medieval volumes; for example he gives two further sentences on the economic reasons for the end of the Viking incursions (compare 1762: 1.219 and 1773: 1:308), and adds short paragraphs on taxation and trade in the reigns of Henry III (1762: 2.59 and 1770: 2.241, 1773: 2.230-231), Edward I (1762: 2.124 and 1770: 2.340-341), Edward III (1762: 2.238 and 1770: 2.523-524) and Henry IV (1762: 2.297 and 1770: 3.90). Some of the revisions can be seen as attempts to provide a fragmentary sketch of a social history. New information is given on the introduction of coats of arms in the reign of Richard I (1762: 1.355 and 1773: 2.38), the rise of London in the reign of John (1762: 1.396 and 1770: 2.104), the Christian reluctance to allow the conversion of the Jews (1762: 2.57 and 1773: 2.227), the hospitality of the nobility in the reign of Edward II (1762: 2.155 and 1770: 2.389), medieval ignorance (1762: 2.240 and 1770: 2.527), the expense of the court in the reign of Richard II (1762: 2.282 and 1770: 3.65) and the barbarity of manners in the reign of Henry IV (1762: 2.297 and 1773: 3.83-84). Hume also ventures a few additional attempts at humour, or at least historical colour: for instance, a paragraph from Giraldus on the gluttony of the monks and the reaction of Henry II to their complaints (1762: 1.330 and 1773: 1.470), and speculation on the difficulty of making Edward II laugh (1762: 2.155 and 1773: 2.370). Changes with clear political import are scarce, although Hume does add material which emphasises the lack of power of the early commons and the fact that the "crowd" were mere spectators in the great councils (1762: 1.409 and 1773: 2.119-120). He also turns a historical remark into a dreadful warning, as a simple notice of the first instance of "debt contracted upon public security" is expanded: "The commencement of this pernicious practice deserves to be noted; a practice, the more likely to become pernicious, the more a nation advances in opulence and credit. The ruinous effects of it are now become apparent, and threaten the very existence of the nation" (1778: 3.215; compare 1762: 2.384). Like the revised medieval volumes, the later editions of the Tudor sections of the History contain additional material on economic and social affairs. Thus Hume comes to note the first importation of certain vegetables (1759: 1.283 and 1770: 4.304-305; extended 1773: 4.274) and gives an expanded account of the economy and monopolistic practices in the reign of Henry VIII (1759: 1.286 and 1770: 4.309-310). He adds paragraphs on the lack of refinement in Tudor England (1759: 1.402 and 1770: 4.497), on interest, innovations, posts, export, agriculture and prices in the reign of Elizabeth (1759: 2.735 and 1770: 5.513-514), and on the significance of Burleigh's possession of expensive plate (1759: 2.735 and 1770: 5.517-518). As in the medieval volumes, there are few overtly political revisions; but Hume does explicate his use of the term "ancient constitution" (1759: 2.716 and 1762: 4.314-315 n), emphasises the power of the office of High Constable (1759: 2.719 and 1770: 5.484), and gives examples of the arbitrary imprisonment of individuals who had incurred the displeasure of privy counsellors and noblemen (1759: 2.724 and 1763: 5.485). It is in the Tudor volumes that Hume, perhaps especially in his revisions, is most prone to a smug approval of his own era: the apparent decrease in executions is indicative of "a great improvement in morals since the reign of Henry VIII. And this improvement has been chiefly owing to the encrease of industry and the arts . . ." (1778: 4.276; compare 1759: 1.284). Similarly Hume adds a celebratory gloss to his comments upon the increase in population and military force in England: "one good county in England is able to make, at least to support, a greater effort than the whole kingdom was capable of in the reign of Harry V. . . . Such are the effects of liberty, industry, and good government!" (1778: 5.483). However, the Stuart volumes contain the highest proportion of Hume's later researches and qualifications. In the first version of the appendix to the reign of James I, Hume appears the diligent but baffled researcher: "I have not been able, by any inquiry, to learn the common price of butcher meat during the reign of James" (1754: 128). He then proceeds to offer his own speculations and calculations on the subject. In the 1762 edition he adds a footnote, later incorporated into the text: "The author has since discovered in Dr. Birch's Life of Prince Henry, that that prince made an allowance of near a groat a pound for all the beef and mutton used in his family. . . . This price agrees very well with the calculations here delivered" (1762: 5.120 n). The 1770 edition includes new information on trade and economic affairs culled from various sources, information which is placed in the appendix to the reign of James I and his account of England under the later Stuarts (compare 1754: 133 and 1770: 6.205-206; 1757: 449 and 1770: 8.346-347). Hume recalculates or revises figures earlier given in the History ; for example, he reduces his estimate of the proportion of English shipping engaged in trade with America (1754: 135 and 1763: 6.128), reduces the figure given for the size of Cromwell's army at Worcester (1757: 29 and 1770: 7.209), alters his estimate of the number of major-generals during the Commonwealth (1757: 60 and 1770: 7.261) and revises downwards the number of deaths caused by the plague of 1665 (1757: 167 and 1773: 7.408). Further reading enables him gradually to expand his original note on the comparative lack of freedom in the England of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century (1754: 118-119); in 1762 he adds a reference to "a paper wrote by a patriot in 1627" (1762: 5.112 n to 110), in 1773 he quotes Malsherbe (1773: 6.571 note Q to 6.161), and finally the 1778 edition adds the authority of Machievelli (1778: 6.570 note Q to 6.161). In this instance further reading sustains the interpretations of earlier editions, but Hume is prepared to alter his initial statements in the light of new information: thus in a correction of a geographical error "Draiton in Cheshire" becomes "Draiton in Shropshire" (1754: 405 and 1759: 1.394). New publications can modify Hume's account of events. He takes some pleasure in noting the effects of the appearance of Sir John Dalrymple's Memoirs (1778: 8.43 fn.), but not all the new information he obtains bolsters his original interpretations. In his treatment of the controversy surrounding Charles and Glamorgan's commission he partially defers to the work of Birch (compare 1754: 413-414 n and 1759: 1.402-403 n), and most notably the Memoirs of James II force the modification of certain parts of the History (Hume described the Memoirs in December 1763 as a "great Treasure . . . of historical Knowledge" 11 ). Thus to his account of Charles II's relation to Catholicism he adds "The Author confesses that the King's zeal for Popery went further than is here said; as appears from many passages in James II's Memoirs" (1767: 7.398 n). 12 Again in the edition of 1767 Hume adds new material on Brounker's decision to slacken sail during a naval engagement against the Dutch: "King James in his Memoirs gives an account of this affair different from what we meet with in any historian" (1767: 7.412 n). One of Hume's most striking reconsiderations is in relation to the existence of a secret agreement between Charles II and Louis XIV. Hume's original note is to the effect "No treaty . . . with France ever appeared" and that Charles merely believed he had an informal understanding with Louis (1757: 238 n). Research obliges him to re-examine this statement: "Since the publication of this History, the Author has had occasion to see the most direct and positive evidence of this conspiracy. From the humanity and candour of the principal of the Scotch College at Paris, he was admitted to peruse James II's Memoirs, kept there. . ." (1767: 8.3-4 n). Hume, then, is prepared to modify, to a certain extent, his original narrative in accordance with new findings. Hume can revise in the light of new information; but other revisions are the product of his own narrative repatternings. Thus the humiliation of Henry II in his anxiety to reconcile himself to Becket is given additional emphasis (1762: 1.290 and 1773: 1.412), and the note elaborating the chastity of Joan of Arc is omitted in the final edition (1762: 2.345 n and 1778: 3.156). Perhaps the most interesting of the revisions to the medieval volumes is that involving the siege of Harfleur in 1415. In all but the edition of 1778, the siege ends in a massacre. The French troops holding the town had promised to capitulate by a certain date if not relieved, but had delayed their surrender and "Henry, incensed at their breach of faith . . . took the town by storm, and put all the garrison to the sword; except some gentlemen, whom the victorious army, in hope of reaping profit by their ransom, were induced to spare" (1762: 2.307). In the revised version of the end of the siege it is implied that the governor surrendered, and there is no reference to any killing: "The day came, and there was no appearance of a French army to relieve [the governor]. Henry, taking possession of the town, placed a garrison in it, and expelled all the French inhabitants, with an intention of peopling it anew with English" (1778: 3.99). The most noticeable narrative recastings of the Tudor volumes involve wholesale excisions of material dealing with events in early modern Europe. Hume's set-piece description of Julius II is eventually omitted: "Animated with an unextinguishable thirst of glory, inflexible in his schemes, undaunted in his enterprizes, indefatigable in his pursuits; magnanimous, imperious, domineering; his vast soul broke thro' all the fetters, which old age and a priestly character imposed upon it, and, during his pontificate, kept the world in perpetual agitation." (1759: 1.74; compare 1773: 3.415). There is a similar substantial reduction in the account of the defeat of Venice by the League of Cambrai and the aftermath of the defeat (compare 1759: 1.75-76 and 1773: 3.415-416), and the account of the dealings between France and Julius is omitted in later editions (compare 1759: 1.77 and 1773: 4.416). Indeed Hume seems to have felt that in his first version of the reign of Henry VIII, rather like the king himself, he had become entangled in the affairs of the continent. Hume sees Henry as recklessly involved in Europe, instead of pursuing the more prudent policy of attempting to maintain the Continental balance of power (1778: 4.20). In revising the History for the 1773 edition Hume attempts to purge the narrative of much of this European history; hence his modifications to his accounts of the political situation in Italy in 1515 (compare 1759: 1.102-103 and 1773: 4.10), the accession of Charles V (compare 1759: 1.104-105 and 1773: 4.12), the war between Charles and Francis in 1521 (1759: 1.114 and 1773: 4.25), the actions of Bourbon in 1523 (1759: 1.130-131 and 1773: 4.51), the Italian wars of 1524 (1759: 1.133 and 1773: 4.54), the aftermath of the battle of Pavia (1759: 1.136 and 1773: 4.57), the negotiations between Francis and Charles after Pavia (1759: 1.141 and 1773: 4.64-65) and the progress of Italian affairs in 1525 (1759: 1.142-143 and 1773: 4.65). In all these instances Hume reduces substantially the coverage of the situation in Europe, replacing the omitted paragraphs, if at all, with a transitionary sentence or two. Even parts of the narrative dealing with Scottish and French affairs, which might appear to have a more direct relevance to the history of England, are modified in the revisions of 1773; thus two paragraphs on the French troops in Scotland in 1548 are excised (1759: 1.310 and 1773: 4.313), as is a passage on the surrender of the beseiged protestants in St. Andrews (1759: 1.299-300 and 1773: 4.299). In the final edition of the History Hume reduces his account of the French attack upon England in 1545 (1759: 1.268 and 1778: 4.250) and drops nearly a page on the terms of the marriage between the Dauphin and the Queen of Scots (1759: 1.396-397 and 1778: 4.440). Hume's "withdrawal" from European history is the most noticeable aspect of the revisions of the Tudor volumes, but in the same volumes he does engage in some comparatively minor, but none the less interesting, reconsiderations. For example, he omits the reflections, present in the first Tudor edition, on the fortunes of Elizabeth Woodville, possibly unhappy with their sententious banality (1759: 1.14 and 1762: 3.314). One of the most curious revisions of the Tudor volumes is that which represents the execution of Mary Queen of Scots as tragic spectacle; to the account of the execution given in the first edition, Hume adds the reaction of the "audience". After beheading Mary, the executioner "instantly held [the head] up to the spectators. . . . The attention of all the other spectators was fixed on the melancholy scene before them; and zeal and flattery alike gave way to present pity and admiration for the expiring princess" (1762: 4.220; compare 1759: 2.662). Thus the execution of Mary comes to have affinities with the death of Charles I, as tragic spectacle. Not all of Hume's revisions directly affect the main lines of his narrative; but some revisions which bear upon particular characters or subjects display in an interesting fashion the workings of his historical consciousness. The interpretation of Raleigh in the History of Great Britain , initially unfavourable, is developed and expanded. Raleigh's claim to Guiana on behalf of England becomes "imaginary" (1754: 69 and 1759: 1.60), and his crime is increased from "violence" to "violence and piracy" (1754: 71 and 1759: 1.62). James' declaration of the case against Raleigh, which originally "must be allowed to have great weight" (1754: 71 n), becomes indisputable ". . . great weight, or rather to be of undoubted credit" (1759: 1.62 n). Hume explicates the absurdity of Raleigh's defence that the peace made with Spain had not encompassed the Indies (compare 1754: 72 n to 71 and 1759: 1.63 n to 63), and from Howel's Letters adduces more evidence for the culpability of Raleigh's son (compare 1754: 73 n to 71 and 1759: 1.64 n to 62). By contrast, Bacon is somewhat rehabilitated in the revisions. Hume omits a footnote on Bacon's corrupt—and arbitrary—treatment of the vintners (1754: 83-84 n and 1762: 5.77), reduces Bacon's comparative inferiority to Galileo (1754: 139 and 1759: 1.129), and increases the "brilliance" and reduces the "unnaturalness" of Bacon's wit (1754: 139 and 1759: 1.129). Buckingham, too, in the course of the revisions is rehabilitated, with clear political implications: James and, in particular, Charles no longer appear inexplicably in thrall to an evil minister, but rather misguidedly support an intemperate counsellor. Hume's additions provide conjectural explanations for the influence and behaviour of Buckingham (compare 1754: 101 and 1778: 6.137, 1754: 104 n and 1759: 1.95 n). In the 1762 edition Buckingham's possibly generous advance of his own money for the navy in the absence of parliamentary funds is noted (1754: 149 and 1762: 5.140), and parliament appears to be waiting for a pretext to attack Buckingham and the king (1754: 149 and 1762: 5.140). Hume omits a paragraph critical of Buckingham's behaviour in Spain and to Parliament (1754: 145-146 and 1759: 1.135). Similarly he expands a footnote to develop the contradictions in which the commons found themselves involved in their attempts to accuse Buckingham and Charles of misrepresentation regarding the Spanish marriage (1754: 154 n and 1759: 1.144 n). In the 1754 edition the impeachment of Buckingham by the commons seems justified: "Tho' they could fix no legal crime against the duke, they justly regarded him as a very unable and even pernicious minister" (1754: 157). Over several editions Buckingham's impeachment appears less justifiable, until Hume's final phrasing suggests the impotence of the parliament and gives no authorial imprimatur to the judgment of the commons: "Though after canvassing the matter several months, they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke, they regarded him as an unable and perhaps a dangerous minister" (1773: 6.221). Small alterations reduce the violence of Buckingham's character (for example 1754: 145 and 1773: 6.202; 1754: 164 and 1773: 6.232). The cumulative effect of such revisions is not, of course, to establish Buckingham as a hero of the History , but to reduce his status as villain and to lessen any blame that might be attached to the kings' support of their favourite. Less obviously explicable is Hume's late decision to omit his crafted paradigm of Bristol as the loyal servant of his royal master (see Letters 2.329). In all the editions up to 1778 Hume develops an exemplary mini-narrative (1754: 109-110) in which Bristol, having out of loyalty to James I opposed Buckingham in the Spanish negotiations, faces his own return to England and the powerful enmity of the royal favourite. Philip IV offers Bristol a safe and honourable exile in Spain, where he might reside as an edifying example of steadfast loyalty, for the instruction of Philip's own servants. Bristol gracefully declines this suggestion, prompting the Spanish king to offer him a gift to alleviate the probable ruin which faces him in England. Philip adds that this gift would forever remain a secret, to which Bristol magnanimously responds: "There is one person," replied the generous Englishman, "who must necessarily know it: He is the Earl of Bristol, who will certainly reveal it to the King of England" (1754: 109-110). Hume excises the story of Philip and Bristol in his last revisions (see 1778: 6.146). The marquess of Montrose, in the first edition of the History a superlatively heroic figure, is reduced somewhat in revision. "The most heroic valour" which he displayed at Philip-haugh becomes "great valour" (1754: 410 and 1770: 7.67). Hume reduces Montrose's "magnanimous disposition" into "daring character" (1757: 16 and 1778: 7.178), and omits from later editions the paragraph dealing with Montrose's "manly scorn and indifference" to the exultation of his enemies, and "the even tenor of his heroic mind", maintained even in the pathos of the "tenderness of his last adieu" to his children (see 1757: 18 and 1762: 6.18). Similarly Montrose's "truly heroic actions" become "great military actions" (1757: 20 and 1770: 7.194). Overall, Hume seems intent upon reducing the status of Montrose from that of a hero to that of a "great" man. By contrast, Monk is given a late prominence in the historical pantheon. In his final revisions Hume recasts his assessment of Monk's abilities (compare 1757: 130 and 1778: 7.351), and adds a substantial note giving an account of his life and actions, in which it is declared that the restorer of the Stuarts is the Briton "who, since the beginning of time, has rendered the most durable and most essential services to his native country" (1778: 7.468, n to 7.467). There is no single explanation for these various revisionary reassessments of characters in the History , but such revisions do indicate Hume's acute concern with the texture of his work. Hume by no means accepted all the more minor criticisms levelled at his earlier volumes, but he obviously read and carefully considered the strictures of his reviewers, and could be receptive to detailed criticism. For example the Critical Review 2 (1756) had exploded Hume's discussion of the balance between naval forces and land fortifications (386-387), a discussion which was dropped from later editions (compare 1757: 67 and 1762: 6.88). Similarly the Monthly Review 12 (1755) had remarked the anachronistic nature of Hume's reference to the Prince of Wales in the context of the Gunpowder Plot (211), pointing out that the title of Prince of Wales was not bestowed upon the King's son until 1610—the criticism was met with an emendation (compare 1754: 22 and 1759: 1.21). Occasionally, too, the historian's own situation in history ironically forced him to modify his earlier narrative in response to events. Hume's original confidence in the maintenance of British rule in America, that "A mild government and great naval force have preserved and may long preserve the dominion of England over her colonies" (1754: 135), is replaced by doubt: ". . . have preserved, and may still preserve during some time, the dominion . . ." (1770: 6.208). A passage describing America as containing "the seeds of many a noble state" and a possible "asylum . . . for liberty and science" is omitted from later editions (1754: 134 and 1759: 1.124). Historical perspective can be altered by change in the historian's own society. Hence Hume is obliged to append a note to his original discussion of prices in the reign of James (1754: 128), noting that "This volume was writ about fifteen years before the present edition. In that period, prices have perhaps risen more, than during the preceding hundred and fifty" (1770: 6.196 n). Having examined some of the revisions which are the product of Hume's research, detailed criticisms or comparatively minor narrative restructurings, I now wish to turn to the more "central" aspects of the revisions—Hume's reworkings of his attitudes to religion and to the Stuarts. Hume's own version of the reception of the first volume of the History presents him as the wronged and embattled author. Riding out, and ignoring, the storms of criticism, the author sees his History somehow gradually attain popularity. Hume, by his own account, in no way responds to hostile criticism, or allows his authorial integrity to be compromised: "But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons, to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances, that the copy-money given me by the booksellers, much exceeded anything formerly known in England, I was become not only independent, but opulent." 13 Exposed to the wild forces of hostile criticism, the History strangely survives and prospers. However, an examination of the criticisms levelled at the first volumes of the History , and of the revisions, produces a more complex picture. Hume's navigational responses to criticism play an important part in the steering of the History through "winds and seasons" to ultimate success. Flexman's account of the first volume of the History of Great Britain in the Monthly Review 12 (1755) recognised Hume's talents in "narration" and "delineation" but raised questions about his possession of "the more essential articles of IMPARTIALITY and CONSISTENCY" (207). For Flexman, the volume contained "strong indications of a direct opposition to the genuine maxims of our civil polity, as well as indecent reflections on the protestant religion" (207). Flexman cited various passages as examples of Hume's objectionable treatment of religion (207-208, 214-216, 223-235). In quoting Hume's character of James I, Flexman referred to "this delineator's artful disposition of lights and shades" (226) and directed his reader to alternative accounts of James (227 n). He also resisted Hume's attempts to clear Charles' name in the affair of Glamorgan's commission (222-223). Significantly, Flexman sensed a contradiction between Hume's assessment of Charles and the actions of the monarch as displayed in the History itself (228). The History gave a distorted perspective upon English history: "Many facts are concealed, or partially exhibited . . . instead of a full and faithful representation of facts, the reader is often presented with half-views and side-glances of them" (229). The History 's treatment of religion, in Flexman's opinion, was based upon a false dichotomy of (Catholic) "superstition" and (Protestant) "enthusiasm" and was at the very least "far from being such as becomes a gentleman" (229). However, Flexman conceded the merit of the work "if . . . considered only as a work of genius , or, as consisting of general remarks and observations " (228). By far the most thorough and detailed attack upon the first volume of the History was Daniel MacQueen's Letters on Mr. Hume's History of England (1756). The Letters were presented as originating out of a discussion between friends; the second friend, with whom MacQueen is clearly in agreement, particularly objects to Hume's "indecent excursions on the subject of religion, the genius of the Protestant faith, and the characters of the first reformers." 14 As in the Monthly , Hume is seen as having stepped beyond the acceptable bounds of gentlemanly behaviour through his treatment of religion (38). MacQueen also seized upon the passages in the History critical of Charles I, accumulating instances of apparently anti-Stuart rhetoric (229-248) to provide a list of points in the History at which Hume, ironically, "seems all awake to the noble sentiments of liberty and social rights" (236). Flexman, too, had hinted at a contradiction between Hume's account of the king's actions and his final assessment of Charles. At first optimistic ( Letters 1.189), Hume had received early criticism with some equanimity: "I observe that some of the weekly papers have been busy with me. I am as great an atheist as Bolingbroke; as great a Jacobite as Carte; I cannot write English &amp;c." ( Letters 1.214). He did not attribute the poor sale of the first volume in England to his treatment of religion, although writing to Millar in April 1755 he was at least prepared to consider it as a possibility: "I shall give no further Umbrage to the Godly: Tho' I am far from thinking, that my Liberties on that head have been the real Cause of checking the Sale of the first Volume" ( Letters 1.218). However, by May Hume was self-pitying—"Surely, never was man so torne in Pieces by Calumny" ( Letters 1.221)—but he still blamed the London booksellers rather than the unpopularity of some of his opinions: "The Freedoms with Religion ought [in Scotland] to have given more Displeasure; &amp; the Cry of Jacobitism as much, notwithstanding what may be imagined" ( Letters 1.222). Finally, writing to Clephane, probably in 1756, Hume seemed to recognise a degree of responsibility for the poor reception accorded the History . But in his own presentation he remained innocent of any malicious intent towards his readers, guilty merely of overestimating their powers of discrimination: "I am convinced that whatever I have said of religion should have received some more softenings. There is no passage in the History which strikes in the least at revelation. But as I run over all the sects successively, and speak of each of them with some mark of disregard, the reader, putting the whole together, concludes that I am of no sect; which to him will appear the same thing as the being of no religion." ( Letters 1.237). Hume retained a preference for the first volume over the second ( Letters 1.240, 242), and continued to be surprised at the hostility aroused by the first volume ( Letters 1.242). 15 However, the tone of the second volume of the History , published in 1756, was taken by some of Hume's critics as a vindication of their assault upon the first volume. Writing for the Monthly Review 16 (1757), Rose made a clear distinction between the first and second volumes of the History . In the second volume there were "none of the indecent excursions on the subject of religion" of the first volume (36), and Rose implied "prudential considerations" as the reason for Hume's apparent retreat (36). Although thinking well of the language and structure of the volume (49, 50), Rose called into question Hume's impartiality in his characters of Charles II and James II (43, 45), and indicted him for a general lack of impartiality (50). The lukewarm attitude of the History towards religion in general, and Christianity in particular, also continued to give concern (50). On the whole, however, the Monthly 's review of the second volume was far more positive than its reaction to the first. The Critical Review 2 (1756) while criticising details, both historical and stylistic, of the second volume, was generally very favourable (385-404). However much he might have enjoyed the warmer critical response to his second volume, Hume was clearly stung by the accusation, implicit in the Monthly , that he had revised his principles, or rather refrained from expressing them, in order to increase the sale of the History . This accusation was given its most explicit form in Brown's Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times (1757, 1758). In illustration of his contention that fashionable infidelity was based upon superficial thought, Brown produced an exaggerated but effective version of the reception of the first volume and Hume's reaction. Hume had written intent upon " Popularity and Gain ": A large Impression was published, and a small Part sold. The Author being asked, why he had so larded his Work with Irreligion, he modestly replied, "He had done it that his book might sell".—It was whispered him, that he had totally mistaken the Spirit of the Times . . . as the few Readers of Quarto's that yet remain, lie mostly among the serious Part of Mankind, he had offended his best Customers, and ruined the Sale of his Book. This Information had a notable Effect; for a second Volume . . . hath appeared; not a Smack of Irreligion is to be found in it; and an Apology for the first concludes the whole. 16 Brown returned to the attack in the second volume of the Estimate . Elaborating on his earlier remarks, he asserted that in his essays Hume had had no fear of offending the "Godly"; but the economics of authorship had produced a superficial conversion: "With St. PAUL, Godliness was Gain : But with this Man , Gain produceth Godliness " (2.87). Brown was intent upon submitting writers such as Hume to " Just Disgrace " as a partial substitute for the "condign Punishment" which was unfortunately not permitted by the "free and happy Constitution" (2.88), and Hume does indeed seem to have been wounded by the attack upon his authorial integrity in Brown's immensely popular tract. 17 In fact, the revisions to the History do involve Hume in a retreat from his initial stance in relation to revealed religion. 18 In response to the negative criticism of the first volume he consistently toned down the aggressive or ironic aspects of the History 's treatment of Christianity. 19 At the beginning of the 1754 volume, Hume gives a brief account of the Reformation, as background to his version of the religious arguments in the reign of James I; this account was rendered superfluous by the subsequent publication of the Tudor volumes, but the tone of Hume's later and more extensive coverage of the religious upheavals of the sixteenth century is far more restrained than the sketch he first gives. In 1754 Hume is prepared to recognise only "two species of religion, the superstitious and the fanatical" (1754: 7), and holds both species, but particularly the latter, up to ridicule. To the partisans of the "fanatical" religion he attributes an "inflexible intrepidity, with which they braved dangers, torments, even death itself; while they preached the doctrine of peace, and carried the tumults of war, thro' every part of Christendom" (1754: 8). The "fanatics" of Protestantism are lunatics: "their inflamed imagination, unconfined by any forms of liturgy, had full liberty to pour out itself, in wild, unpremeditated addresses to the Divinity" (1754: 8). At the start of Elizabeth's reign, the returning English exiles imported a virulent and dangerous strain of religion into their own country (1754: 8). From the edition of 1759 onwards Hume omits these incautious remarks. It is noticeable that MacQueen had taken particular exception to page 8 of the 1754 edition (11-32, 201-227). Similarly in the later editions of the History Hume modifies his persona of superior and amused observer surveying the foibles of religion. In the edition of 1754 he offers his readers some information on "the Roman catholic superstition, its genius and spirit" (1754: 25). With a calculated disingenuousness, Hume expects his History to outlive Christianity: "History addresses itself to a more distant posterity than will ever be reached by any local or temporary theology; and the characters of sects may be studied, when their controversies shall be totally forgotten" (1754: 25). Inevitably, this passage elicited an irate observation from MacQueen: " Distant indeed they must be, whom no knowledge of the capital articles of the distinction between the Popish and Protestant churches shall be able to reach" (11). Hume portrays pre-Renaissance Europe as lost in a stupefied and absolute attachment to superstition, an attachment that would have been slowly loosened by a progressive exposure to classical learning and scientific knowledge (1754: 26). Indeed the gradual weaning of men from superstition had begun, only to be reversed by the Reformation, and the inevitable Counter-Reformation. The Reformation appears as an unfortunate, indeed catastrophic, upheaval: "upon the revival of letters, very generous and enlarged sentiments of religion prevailed thro'out all Italy. . . . But when the enraged and fanatical reformers took arms against the papal hierarchy, and threatened to rend from the church at once all her riches and authority: no wonder she was animated with equal zeal and ardor, in defence of such antient and invaluable possessions" (1754: 26). Hume's subsequent omission of this passage (1759: 1.24) is indicative of reluctance to continue to offend his readership by preserving in his text an explanation of papal reaction. Hume's later description of the onset of the Reformation in Europe (1763: 4.32-42) takes account of the susceptibilities of his Protestant readership. The implications of the earlier passage had drawn a withering attack from MacQueen (85-132). In the edition of 1754 Christianity seems a mass of indecipherable contradictions—"As far as any coherence can be traced among the systems of modern theology . . . (1754: 40). These contradictions are later reduced to a more manageable intellectual problem: "In tracing the coherence among the systems of modern theology . . ." (1759: 1.36). In the 1754 edition Hume's implied audience appears to be composed of the curious "philosophes" of a later and more enlightened age; thus Hume considers that "It may be proper for the information of posterity to observe" that to Charles I the sacraments of communion and baptism were invalid unless administered by a properly consecrated "presbyter" (1754: 453-454). Hume blandly makes Charles' apology: "If this prejudice of the King appear superstitious and contemptible to some philosophical minds, as certainly the question is very minute; it ought still to be considered, that he was supporting the religion, which, at his accession, he found, by law, established in his kingdoms" (1754: 454). Both Charles' apparently "contemptible" prejudice and Hume's calculatedly gratuitous apology are subsequently excised (see 1759: 1.442). Hume's account of the progress of Scottish Calvinism is likewise toned down in subsequent volumes. In the edition of 1754 Calvinism is a violent and furious tide (1754: 60) and the Calvinist "leaders" merely signalise the absurdity of their followers; the preachers "did not, properly speaking, lead the multitude: They only ran before them, in all their fanatical extravagencies" (1754: 61). This section, prefacing the narrative of James I's dealings with the Scottish Church, became redundant once the Tudor volumes had been added to the History ; but the tone of Hume's potted history of Calvinism in 1754 is much more aggressive than the history given at greater length in the relevant part of the Tudor volumes. Hume initially describes the immediate effects of the Reformation in Scotland as the "pernicious" result of religious "fury" (1754: 61). These effects are toned down in later editions to a "disturbance" produced by "zeal" (1759: 1.53). In the first edition of the History the detached observer notes the absolutely destructive consequences of the Calvinist contagion, which "was observed to occasion the most enormous ravages in the breast, and to subvert every rational principle of conduct and behaviour" (1754: 62). Subsequently Hume presents Calvinism as modifying the behaviour of the individual rather than destroying his or her identity as rational being: ". . . was observed to occasion great disturbances in the breast, and in many respects to confound all rational principles of conduct and behaviour" (1759: 1.54). Not only Calvinism, but also James' attempted additions to the rites of the church are subject to a gentler treatment, "superstition" being reduced to "ceremony" (compare 1754: 63 and 1759: 1.54). The small but consistent verbal alterations to the treatment of religion in the History are indicative of the studied and thoroughgoing nature of Hume's withdrawal from his initial stance. Unsurprisingly, MacQueen had objected to Hume's earlier lexicon (37-38). Thus "bigotry" is reduced to "spirit" or "zeal" (compare 1754: 94, 99 and 1759: 1.85, 90). "Fanaticism" becomes "zeal" (compare 1754: 75 and 1759: 1.66), and "fanatics" mere "enthusiasts" (compare 1754: 356, 382 and 1759: 1.345, 371). Likewise, "the Romish superstition" (1754: 222) becomes "the Romish worship" (1759: 1.213). In parallel to these "corrections" Hume consistently excises the adjectives or adverbs that might have given offence to readers of the first edition of the History . The "animosity of the doctrinal puritans" ceases to be "bigotted" (compare 1754: 193 and 1759: 1.182; 1754: 415 and 1759: 1.404). On occasion the modifying "enthusiastic" may be removed (compare 1754: 382 and 1759: 1.371). "Furious" and "fervour", with their implications of the violent irrationality of the proceedings of the "zealots", are also sometimes dropped from later editions (compare 1754: 394, 425 and 1759: 1.384, 414), and the "extravagencies and singularities" of religious spirit are reduced to less grotesque "singularities" (compare 1754: 213 and 1759: 1.203). In addition, the more aggressive sallies of the 1754 volume against religion are usually withdrawn. Thus the comment that "of all European nations the British were at that time [1625], and till long after, sunk into the lowest and most odious bigotry" (1754: 150) is moderated to ". . . and till long after, the most under the influence of that religious spirit, which tends rather to inflame bigotry, than increase peace and mutual charity" (1759: 1.140). Of the controversy over the rival terms "Sabbath" and "Sunday", Hume had first remarked that, although "a difference about a few unmeaning syllables", it was worthy of the historian's attention as it involved the realities of "power and government" (1754: 151)—a deliberately patronising simplification subsequently omitted (1759: 1.140). Hume's revisions weaken his at first aggressively stated alliance of religious and political authoritarianism; Hume notes in the 1754 edition that in 1626 sermons were preached in favour of the exertion of the royal prerogative, "That speculative despotism might lend assistance to practical, and religious tyranny support civil" (1754: 160), but later modifies the passage to reduce the severity of the balanced parallelisms: "That religious prejudices might support civil authority" (1759: 1.150). Hume is at first astonished and disgusted at the casualties which the Huguenots are prepared to endure during the siege of La Rochelle: "Such mighty influence had the religious spirit over that sect; and so much did it overbalance in their breasts every motive of self preservation, of duty to their prince, and of regard to their native country!" (1754: 187). As might be expected, he omits this exclamation from subsequent editions (see 1759: 1.176). The ponderous efforts at anti-Christian irony dotted about the volume of 1754 are almost unreservedly retracted. In the first volume of the History , when discussing the controversies between James and the Scottish church, Hume seems to be offering his equally knowing reader entertainment of an almost titillating quality: "no sooner is the mode or the controversy past, than they are universally discovered to be so frivolous as not to be mentioned with dignity or even decency amidst the ordinary course of human transactions. On these occasions, history is sometimes constrained to depart a little from her native and accustomed gravity" (1754: 63). In Hume's account, the dispute which above all divided the two parties was that over the manner of receiving communion; James insisted that the communicants should kneel, while "The ministers strenuously maintained the privilege of reposing on their seats, during the performance of that sacred rite, and would by no means submit to the posture prescribed to them" (1754: 64). The jocular ambiguity of "seats", with the hints that the ministers are suffering from constipation and refusing medical advice ("strenuously", "the posture prescribed"), and the adjacent passages ridiculing the controversies, are excised in the edition of 1759, as Hume curtly notes "It will not be necessary to give a particular account of the ceremonies which the King was so intent to establish" (1759: 1.54). The irony directed at religion in the 1754 volume does not always take the form of such good-humoured contempt; but Hume is equally willing to retract his more stinging side-swipes at Christianity. Thus he first presents the Scots of 1643 as overjoyed at the prospect of "extending the kingdom of Christ" (1754: 366) by force of arms; in later editions the Scots welcome the less ironic prospect of "spreading their mode of religion" (1759: 1.356). The 1754 edition displays "spiritual pride" ironically, as "so essential to the saintly character" (1754: 425); in the 1759 edition Hume regards the same vice more earnestly, as "spiritual pride, to which a mistaken piety is so subject" (1759: 1.414). It is Hume's opinion, in the 1754 edition, that the presbyterian party in 1647 "would probably be more inoffensive" than the independent, and in the same edition he subjoins the sly observation "To which some will be inclined to add, however unjustly, that, having less of the saint in their composition, they naturally would not be so furious and mischievous" (1754: 432 n). The insinuation is subsequently dropped (see 1759: 1.419). If Hume's revised treatment of religion in the History manifests anything, other than a surprised and anxious reaction to hostile criticism, it is an increased emphasis upon the value of toleration. MacQueen had preceptively noted a contradiction between the aggressive tone of the 1754 volume and Hume's "pretension to the spirit of calm and candid inquiry" (39). As he withdraws his aggressive or ironic observations, Hume wishes to appear the proponent of toleration, a toleration—or tolerance—that should have implications for the reception of his History . In the revisions, Hume's understanding of his idiom is refined and developed. Thus in the course of various editions he gradually adds over a page on the history of the idea of religious toleration—or rather intolerance. In the 1762 edition Hume remarks that the concept of toleration was unknown to the puritans in the reign of James I; neither James nor the puritans accepted the legitimacy of separate churches (1762: 5.114). In 1770 Hume adds to this paragraph a reference to Bacon's essay "De unitate ecclesiae" and its assertion of the necessity of a "uniformity in religion" (1770: 6.185). He later adds a further paragraph (1773: 164-165) on the universal prevalence of religious persecution before the discovery of the paradox of persecution, namely that sects became stronger under repression. Hume is clearly making an implicit plea for toleration and tolerance in another addition made in 1763: "So violent was the bigotry of the times, that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying any one from holding an office, that his wife, or relation, or companions, were papists, tho' he himself were a conformist" (1763: 6.158). "The times" of James I's reign should, Hume implies, stand in sharp contrast to the toleration of the age of George III. The increased concern with toleration that such revisions evince is mirrored by and embodied in the multitude of small verbal alterations, of which we have seen some specimens. The authorial intolerance of the edition of 1754 had itself encouraged an articulation of Christian sentiment and Hume, in accordance with his own tenets, replaces "persecuting" aggression by concessive mildness. The second volume of the History of Great Britain , published in 1757, does adopt a far less aggressive posture vis-à-vis Christianity, and in later years Hume felt less obligation to tone down his presentation of religion in his narrative of the reigns of the later Stuarts; to a large extent, self-censorship had occurred before publication. There are a few points in the second volume where Hume does make post-publication concessions to the possible sensitivities of his readership; thus he eventually withdraws his ostentatious apology to his readers for employing the terms of devotion and theological dispute: "The corruptions of the best things produce the worst; and no wonder that the abuses of religion should of all others be the most odious and ridiculous: In order to mark the genius of the age, we are obliged sometimes in our narration to make use of the same cant and expression, which was then so prevalent" (1757: 20; omitted 1770: 7.194). Similarly Hume retracts his observation that during the Commonwealth, in the absence of an established church, the spirit of enthusiasm was inevitably "raised to such a height as to elude all the tyes of civil and moral duty" (compare 1757: 33 and 1770: 7.216). It is in the second volume of the History of Great Britain that Hume delivers his apology for his treatment of religion in the first. In a long footnote taking as its starting point the spirit of irreligion in the reigns of the later Stuarts, Hume begins with the pious observation that the "sophism, of arguing from the abuse of anything against the use of it, is one of the grossest, and at the same time, the most common, to which men are subject" (1757: 449 n). Anxious at his exercise of self-censorship in the second volume, Hume asserts that he has been consistent in his detection of the abuses of religion: "we have not been sparing, in this volume more than in the former, to remark them" (1757: 450 n to 449). Interestingly, however, the manuscript draft of this passage reveals Hume as prepared to accept the censure—or censorship—or his religious views, but not that of his political history; he "is content to submit to any Censure, if there be found a single Passage objected against, to which these Considerations do not afford a Compleat Answer. As to the civil and political Part of his Performance, he scorns to suggest any Apology, when he thinks himself intitled to Approbation" (MS Keynes Library, King's College, Cambridge; quoted Mossner, Life , 307). It is clear that some parts of the History are more negotiable than others. Hume is "content to submit to any Censure" of the religious aspect of the History and revise accordingly; the revisions of the "civil and political Part of his Performance" will take no account of the criticism of his opponents. Hume's revisions do manifest an increasing sympathy for the earlier Stuarts, a sympathy which, as we have seen, Hume articulated even on his deathbed. In his account of the revisions in his autobiography he appears the proud and independent author, refusing to accede to Whig pressures: "though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther study, reading or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the first two Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side" ( My Own Life , 22-23). The majority of these "political" revisions are made in the early editions of the History . Hume seems to have been piqued by the charges of inconsistency levelled against him, in particular the observation that his "interpretation" of the reign of Charles I was not sustained by his "narrative." This charge, as we have seen, was made both in the Monthly and by MacQueen. Hume subsequently presents any such disparity as the result of his "infection" by prevailing prejudices rather than inconsistency. 20 Adjectives and adverbs that in the 1754 volume attribute culpability or negligence to James I and Charles I are consistently excised or altered and modifiers which place the rulers in a more sympathetic context are added. As a result of this process James appears in a more favourable light; his "ridiculous opinion" (1754: 112) is toned down into an "opinion" (1759: 1.101), while the constraints upon his actions are emphasised as "the narrowness of his revenue" (1754: 125) becomes "the extreme narrowness of his revenue" (1759: 1.115). The cumulative effect of such adverbial or adjectival modifications in the presentation of Charles is significant; to give a few of the many possible examples, "an unjust and illegal invasion" (1754: 163) of the rights of the nation is turned into a simple "invasion" (1759: 1.153), the "arbitrary measures of the court" (1754: 168) become "measures" (1759: 1.158), while the "obstinate perseverance" (1754: 268) of Charles is neutralised as "perseverance" (1759: 1.258). Charles' "great political errors" (1754: 334) are reduced to "political errors, or rather weaknesses" (1759: 1.323), and his decision to seize the five members in person, "this strange resolution" (1754: 318), becomes "this resolution" (1770: 6.516). Originally presented as "blindly running on" in his government (1754: 158), Charles is subsequently seen as simply "running on" (1759: 1.148). In both the original and subsequent editions Charles is reluctant to release the Earl of Arundel from the Tower in 1626, but Hume alters the degree of this reluctance from "After many fruitless shifts and evasions, the King, tho' very ungracefully, was at last obliged to comply" (1754: 156) to "After many fruitless evasions, the King, tho' somewhat ungracefully, was obliged to comply" (1759: 1.146). Overall, the abundance of such "minor" revisions to the presentation of James I and Charles I significantly adjusts the reader's perception of the earlier Stuarts in the later editions of the History . As the small sample of such revisions given above indicates, Hume's tendency is to purge his text of many of the more pejorative adjectives and adverbs which had originally been attached to James and, more importantly, Charles. Gibbon noted that Hume had informed him that in revising the History he had "always laboured to reduce superlatives and soften positives". 21 That the revisions of the original descriptions of the actions of Charles and James are not merely an aspect of a general process of "softening" and "reduction" can be seen by comparing the pattern of adverbial and adjectival modifications affecting the parliamentary cause. The effect of these modifications is to display the anti-Stuart cause in a more unfavourable light. Thus in the first edition of the History the leaders of the commons "generously embraced the side of freedom" (1754: 147); later their magnanimity is replaced by temerity: "they boldly embraced the side of freedom" (1759: 1.137). Similarly, Hume initially sees the decision of the commons to sustain their popularity with force as informed by good sense; they "wisely decided to fortify themselves likeways with terrors" (1754: 256). "Wisely" is omitted from subsequent editions (see 1759: 1.245). Altering the light in which he invites his readers to regard the actions of parliament, Hume also attempts to modify the respect in which the parliamentary leaders are held. In his first edition their actions "should render the English for ever grateful to the memory of their ancestors, who, after repeated contests, at last established [the] noble principle" of the strict subordination of the executive to the law (1754: 287-288). From the edition of 1773 onwards, "for ever" is omitted, and "noble" is qualified by "though dangerous" (1773: 6.423). Likewise, the "very ample praises" (1754: 288) to which the parliamentarians are entitled are reduced to simple "praise" (1773: 6.424). In an analogous way, Hume purges the History of several favourable references to the Dutch republic; the intimate sympathy between the Whigs and the republic involves Hume in a recision of his paean to the Dutch struggle for liberty. In the first edition Dutch liberty was a marvel, spreading itself over the world and defying nature itself (1754: 32); this historical miracle disappears from later editions (see 1759: 1.28). Similarly Hume omits a passage on the subversion of Dutch toleration (1754: 40 and 1773: 6.57), and one on the identity of interests between the republic and England, in which he had stated that despite trading rivalries the "illustrious commonwealth" was the nation's "best and firmest ally", an ally which had "supported [itself] with dignity and independence in all the transactions of Europe" and has "remained closely united with England, whenever that kingdom has acted in conformity with its own true interests" (compare 1754: 58 and 1759: 1.52). Even the conduct of the Dutch in battle comes to be seen in a less favourable light, "great skill and courage" (1757: 213) being reduced to "skill and courage" (1770: 7.510). Clearly, then, Hume's attitudes to the Whig shibboleths of parliamentary authority and the Dutch alliance, are considerably modified in the course of the various editions. 22 In the first volume of the History of Great Britain Hume had, albeit rarely, allowed himself to slide into a Whig, or at least an anti-Stuart, register. As I have noted, such passages were collected and gleefully seized upon by MacQueen: "In almost all these passages the historian, it would appear, declares against the King's arbitrary principles and manner of government, and in favour of those who endeavoured to oppose them" (245). In the first edition such passages as MacQueen cites do appear as somewhat startling excrescences, and thereafter Hume labours to smooth away his "unfortunate" expressions. On occasion, he finds himself obliged to recast whole sentences, in order to purge them of elements of Whig polemic: "It may safely be affirmed, that, except a few prostituted courtiers or bigotted ecclesiastics, all men were highly discontented with this complication of grievances, under which the nation laboured" (1754: 163) becomes "It may safely be affirmed, that, except a few courtiers or ecclesiastics, all men were displeased with this high exertion of prerogative, and this new spirit of administration" (1759: 1.153). In 1627 the court of King's Bench refused to accept that bail could not be granted to a prisoner committed by the King or Council. Relating this incident, Hume had at first presented a nation enslaved: "the judges wisely forbore. The nation, they saw, were already, to the last degree, exasperated. Their chains were now held up to them" (1754: 162). However he is uneasy with the polemic implications of an overt Stuart tyranny, and modifies his account accordingly: "the judges wisely declined complying. The nation, they saw, were already, to the last degree, exasperated. In the present disposition of men's minds, universal complaints prevailed, as if the kingdom were reduced to slavery" (1759: 1.152). Hume's original presentation of Charles' treatment of England as a "conquered province" (1754: 160) is rejected in favour of a view of the king, justified partly by necessity, employing "the whole extent of his prerogative" (1759: 1.150). In Hume's first version, after the trial of Hampden the people "saw plainly the chains, which were prepared for them" (1754: 219); Hume reduces this image, in later editions, to the more moderate "became sensible of the danger, to which their liberty was exposed" (1759: 1.209). As he revises the History , Hume comes to place a greater emphasis upon the precedents by which James and Charles governed their actions. Precedent is increasingly deployed as an explanatory—or apologetic—mechanism in relation to the actions of the two rulers. In the edition of 1754, Hume occasionally treats with derision the claims of the Stuarts to be acting according to precedent. Charles, in 1626, was obliged to employ "the pretext of ancient precedents; tho' it must be confessed, the veil could not possibly be thinner and more transparent" (1754: 159); in later editions Hume accepts the validity of Charles' employment of "the pretence of antient precedents, which, considering the great authority commonly enjoyed by his predecessors, could not be wanting to him" (1759: 1.149). Hume's attention to the precedents for the actions of the Stuarts is seen clearly in the substantial expansion of his justification for James' actions in relation to tonnage and poundage (compare 1754: 35 and 1762: 5.33-34), and he similarly adds a paragraph supporting Charles' right by precedent to tonnage and poundage (compare 1754: 189 and 1762: 5.181). Charles' first imposition of ship-money is, in later editions of the History , related to a similar imposition in the reign of Elizabeth (compare 1754: 159 and 1759: 1.149), and the ecclesiastical policies of Elizabeth are adduced in a revision to provide a partial justification for those of Laud (compare 1754: 204 and 1759: 1.193). The later editions of the History cite the example of Henry VIII as precedent for Charles' levying of a General Loan (compare 1754: 160 and 1773: 6.225-226). As Hume revises, Charles thus comes to be seen as acting according to precedent, rather than according to the dictates of a deluded scheme of despotism. In the edition of 1754, Charles on his accession is presented as misguided: "however moderate his temper, the natural illusions of self-love, joined to his education under James, and to the flattery of courtiers and church-men, had represented his political tenets as certain and uncontroverted" (1754: 148). In subsequent editions Charles is "prepossessed" rather than under an "illusion", and sycophantic flattery is replaced by the lessons of recent history: "however moderate his temper, the natural and unavoidable prepossessions of self-love, joined to the late uniform precedents in favour of prerogative, had made him conceive his political tenets as certain and uncontroverted" (1759: 1.137). The gradual, and significant, permeation of the History by the ideas and implications of precedent can be illustrated by Hume's revision, in two stages, of a particular passage. Concluding his account of Charles in the first edition, Hume had mitigated charges against the king of violating the Petition of Right: "these are more to be ascribed to the lofty ideas of royal prerogative, which he had imbibed, than to any failure in the integrity of his principles" (1754: 469). The edition of 1762 adds to Charles' "lofty ideas" the "necessity of his situation" (1762: 5.459). Finally, the edition of 1778 introduces the idea of Charles' education by precedents: "these are more to be ascribed to the necessity of his situation, and to the lofty ideas of royal prerogative, which, from former established precedents, he had imbibed, than to any failure in the integrity of his principles" (1778: 7.148). By adducing further precedents for the actions of Charles and James, Hume increases the reader's sense of the predicament in which the kings, particularly Charles, found themselves. Indeed, an important aspect of Hume's revisionary enterprise is his sympathetic contextualisation of the plight of Charles. Hume tends to shift the focus of his narrative away from the errors of Charles, and concentrates upon the inevitability of the train of events in which the unfortunate monarch finds himself involved. In the course of the revisions Charles comes consistently to appear the benevolent ruler, struggling with an intractable opposition—indeed an intractable fate. The main lines of this interpretation are, of course, present in the 1754 edition, but the revisions fill in this outline. References in the first edition to Charles' duplicity are eased out of the later editions of the History . Thus in the first edition Charles is seen as regarding his promises concerning the execution of the penal laws against Catholics as of little weight: "he was too apt, in imitation of his father, to consider these promises as temporary expedients, which after the dissolution of the parliament, he was not any farther to regard" (1754: 156). In succeeding editions Charles' apparent breach of promise largely derives from the failure of parliament itself to keep its side of an implicit contract: "he was apt, in imitation of his father, to imagine, that the parliament, when they failed of supplying his necessities, had, on their part, freed him from the obligation of a strict performance" (1759: 1.146). Charles' entering of a reservation in his council-book to the effect that his addressing his enemies as the parliament was not a recognition of their status, is initially criticised by Hume: ". . . tho' it had been much better, no doubt, had the King, in such delicate transactions, betwixt him and his people, kept at the widest difference from such refinements" (1754: 389). In the next edition Hume is slightly less critical of Charles (1759: 1.378), and eventually comes to reject entirely the charge against the king ". . . nor is any thing more common and familiar in all public transactions" (1770: 7:33). In a comparable manner, Hume had initially shown Charles as guilty of some acts of deplorable rashness. Thus Charles' disregard of the privileges of members of parliament in 1640 is condemned: "'Tis hard to say, whether the imprudence or the illegality of these measures, was most egregious" (1754: 242). This condemnation later becomes mild criticism: "These acts of authority were interpreted, with some reason, to be invasions on the rights of national assemblies" (1759: 1.233). Similarly, Charles' signature in 1641 of a petition from royalist officers in the army is, in 1754, presented as outrageous, "the most egregious imprudence" (1754: 281); in later editions Charles signs the petition "somewhat imprudently" (1759: 1.268). By such revisions Charles loses much of the responsibility for his tragedy. Likewise the obstinacy of Charles and his propensity to be swayed by incompetent favourites, originally "the chief cause of all his misfortunes" (1754: 158), becomes "in part" their cause (1759: 1.148). Hume omits from later editions passages critical of Charles' behaviour (compare 1754: 163 and 1759: 1.153) and of his abilities and insight (compare 1754: 238 and 1770: 6.384). Hume's revisions modulate his initial narrative of Charles' dealings with parliament. Charles, in the later editions of the History , appears to have substantial justification for his treatment of the parliamentary opposition. Thus Hume originally informs his readers that the foreign and domestic problems that faced England in 1628 "were ascribed solely to Charles' obstinacy, in adhering to the counsels of Buckingham" (1754: 167); in subsequent editions he makes clear the responsibility of the "refractory disposition of the two former parliaments" for at least some of the problems (see 1759: 1.157). When parliament in 1628 voted five subsidies to Charles, the king declared himself satisfied even with such an inadequate sum (1754: 171); Hume later enforces this gratitude with the addition of an example of Charles' sentimental benevolence: "and even tears of affection started in his eye, when he was informed of this concession" (1759: 1.161). Hume increasingly develops an emphasis upon the "natural" aspects of Charles' hostile reaction to his parliaments. In the final revisions of the History , a comment is added on the remonstrance of the commons to the king in 1628: "And as it was the first return, which he met with for his late beneficial concessions, and for his sacrifices of prerogative, nothing could be more the object of just and natural indignation" (1778: 6.259). The final edition also contains a new paragraph sympathetically elaborating the reasons for Charles' reluctance to allow the commons a long session in 1640, in which the reader, through Charles, is invited to see the commons as an ill-mannered and possibly malicious acquaintance: "After the past experience of their ill-humour, and of their encroaching disposition, he thought that he could not, in prudence, trust them with a long session, till he had seen some better proofs of their good intentions" (1778: 6.345). The revisions present Charles as responding to parliamentary provocation (compare 1754: 242 and 1759: 1.233). In the first edition Charles' fear of the commons is derived in part from his inability to understand the constitution, as one who "dreaded, above all things, the house of commons, and who never sufficiently respected the constitution" (1754: 247). Charles' fear has a more rational justification in later editions, in which he is a man who "dreaded above all things, the house of commons, and who expected no supply from them on any reasonable terms" (1759: 1.237). As Hume recasts his History , Charles appears increasingly to be struggling with an intractable and unreasonable opponent, a frequently personified house of commons. At times, indeed, the effect of the revisions is to show Charles struggling against his fate, the accidental temporal conjuncture in which he finds himself. In Hume's original version of Charles' plight in 1639, the monarch is responsible for his own predicament: "Charles, by his precipitations and oversights, had brought himself to such a situation, that, whichever side he embraced, his errors must be dangerous" (1754: 234). In the equivalent passage in the 1770 edition, Charles is portrayed as the unfortunate victim of an accident: "Charles had fallen into such a situation . . ." (1770: 6.378). Charles becomes, largely through the revisions, the victim of circumstance. Desperate for money in 1640, he sells a quantity of pepper at a discount for ready money: "Such were the shifts, to which Charles was reduced" (1754: 246). In subsequent editions Hume mentions an additional scheme of the government for raising cash, and replaces "shifts" with "extremities" (1759: 1.236), eliminating the hint of guile attached to the king in the first edition. Similarly, Hume was at first critical of the king's lack of preparation for the war with the Scots in 1640: "yet was there no provision made nor resolution taken against such an exigency" (1754: 247). However, he again comes to efface criticism of Charles, directing the reader's attention to the constraints by which the king is bound: "yet such was the king's situation, that no provision could be made, nor was even any resolution taken against such an exigency" (1759: 1.237). The revisions draw attention to the efforts of Charles to support the honour of the English nation and thus enhance the image of the monarch. Focusing upon both the restrictions imposed upon Charles and his attempts to cope with these restrictions, Hume adds a paragraph on the king's successful despatch of an expedition against Salee, vindicating English honour, which was "the utmost that could be expected from a prince, who had no army nor revenue, and who had not been able, without employing the most difficult and even dangerous expedients, to equip a fleet, and thereby provide in some degree for the reputation and safety of his kingdom" (1759: 202). Eventually, in the final revisions of the History , even Hampden's counsel in 1637 gives a reasoned account of the patriotic justification for Charles' levying of ship-money, although he defends his client on the grounds that such justifications are "reasons of state, not topics of law" (1778: 6.316). In a similar way, Hume in his first edition had provided the royalists with only a tepid excuse for Charles' arbitrary attempts to raise money: "His error was, perhaps, excusable, if, esteeming a formidable navy a great security to the nation, he was not sensible, that, to preserve the harmony of the government, contributed still more to public security, as well as happiness" (1754: 309)—in subsequent editions this passage is omitted, as too critical of Charles, and it is replaced in the edition of 1773 by a passage of abundant praise for the king: "A sure proof, that he had formed no system for enslaving his people is, that the chief object of his government has been to raise a naval, not a military force; a project useful, honourable, nay indispensable, and in spite of his great necessities, brought almost to a happy conclusion" (1773: 6.455-456). Striving to uphold the honour of his nation, the Charles of the revised editions of the History appears in a more positive light, less the careless or ignorant encroacher upon the liberties and privileges of the nation. In order to add to the pathos of the situation of Charles, Hume, in the process of revision, places additional emphasis upon the king's isolation and his humanity. Charles in 1629 was unwilling to sacrifice his allies in the hierarchy to the commons (1754: 194), an example of loyalty which is developed in later editions (1759: 1.183). Charles' loneliness in his confrontation with his enemies is emphasised by Hume's additions to his final characterisation of the king: "Exposed to the assaults of furious, implacable and bigotted factions" (1754: 469) becomes "Exposed, without revenue, without arms, to the assaults . . ." (1759: 1.457). Hume's plaintive additions emphasise the nakedness of Charles in the face of his enemies, and increase the sympathy of the reader for the ill-fated monarch. Among the final additions to the History is a passage at the end of the work which states parliament's responsibility for the upheavals and dissensions in the reigns of both Charles I and Charles II. The various parliaments, in their unwillingness to grant the monarch sufficient revenue, displayed a lamentable lack of historical and political awareness: "these assemblies, unacquainted with public business, and often actuated by faction and fanaticism, could never be made sensible, but too late and by fatal experience, of the incessant change of times and situations" (compare 1757: 446 and 1778: 8.325). Had the various parliaments granted adequate revenues to their rulers "all the disorders in both reigns might easily have been prevented, and probably all reasonable concessions to liberty might peaceably have been obtained from both monarchs" (1778: 8.325). The general tendency of the revisions is undoubtedly to enforce the culpability of the parliaments and the innocence of the early Stuarts, and in particular of Charles. The overall effect of the revisions upon the narrative of the struggle between crown and parliament, then, is clear; however, individual revisions do not invariably entail a more negative presentation of the cause of parliament. Thus Hume rephrases his account of the commons' reaction to the news of the Irish rebellion to remove the implication that the house found the revolt "acceptable" (compare 1754: 303 and 1759: 1.292), and he seems to have felt that he had overwritten his accounts of the "merciless rhetoric" in which the Grand Remonstrance was composed, and omitted a few lines from later editions of the History (compare 1754: 306 and 1759: 1.295); similarly he omits some phrases from his paralleling of the trials of Strafford and Laud, phrases which emphasise the injustice of the proceedings in both cases (compare 1754: 393 and 1759: 1.383). In later editions Hume no longer regards parliament's unilateral assumption of the military force of the kingdom as "the most precipitant and most enormous [usurpation], of which there is any instance in the English history" (compare 1754: 329 and 1762: 5.322) and he introduces a note of caution in his reference to the plans of the commons to apprentice princess Elizabeth to a button-maker (compare 1754: 471 and 1770: 7.161). Hume felt the need for far fewer "political" revisions of the 1757 volume of the History of Great Britain ; doubtless he had incorporated in that volume many lessons learnt from the reception accorded the 1754 volume. However, he does make some significant alterations in his presentation of some major figures and events of the period. He adds a paragraph on Cromwell's "vein of frolic and pleasantry" (1757:75 and 1778: 7.265-266) and becomes implicitly less critical of the sale of Dunkirk in 1662 (1757: 153 and 1778: 7.385). Several comments unfavourable to Charles II are omitted from later editions, for example the statement that he was "too much a slave to pleasure ever to defend himself against its present allurements" (1757: 204 and 1770: 7.496). Hume does occasionally introduce material unfavourable to Charles II, for example the paragraph on the king's embarrassment in the presence of Ormonde (1754: 340 and 1778: 8.162), but the overall trend of the revisions is clear. Likewise, Hume makes few revisions to his account of James II; but those that he does make are generally favourable to the monarch. Initially James, in honouring Jeffreys, appeared to approve of the judge's savage treatment of the rebels: "No body could then doubt but the King intended to rule more by fear than love, and that he was not averse to the cruelties, which had been practised" (1757: 389). This passage is omitted in the edition of 1770, to be replaced in 1773 by a more favourable interpretation of James' attitude: "It is pretended, however, with some appearance of authority, that the King was displeased with these cruelties, and put a stop to them by orders, as soon as proper information of them was conveyed to him" (1773: 8.234). Of course, as a self-conscious "man of letters" Hume was not concerned simply with revisions of patterns of narrative and character. His concern for "style" in his revisions manifests itself in a careful attention to the texture of the History , a desire for the most perfect edition. His concern for the language of his History , and in particular his desire to avoid Scotticisms, is evident from his correspondence (for example Letters 1.233, 236, 243), and in particular the almost cringing tone of his letters to Mallet thanking him for the detection of Scotticisms ( Letters 1.369, 386). The thousands of revisions which Hume's fear of "incorrectness", in particular Scotticisms, involve him are ironically symbolised by the way in which the adjective "Scotch" becomes "Scots" in 1763, and is finally established as "Scottish" in 1770. 23 Acutely aware of his provincial and provisional status in the English community of letters, Hume strove for a perfect "correctness" of register. There was a sense in which his audience was foreign, and all Hume's efforts to attain "perfection" only emphasised his marginal position: "I am as aware of correctness as if I were writing to Greeks or French" ( Letters 2.304). 24 Moreover, revision for Hume entailed an attention not simply to the verbal texture of his work, but also to its physical appearance. The History is structurally altered with the edition of 1770; the longer notes are placed at the end of each volume, so that they no longer clutter the foot of the page—another manifestation of Hume's striving for a clear, pellucid narrative without any potentially jarring distractions. It is also noticeable that in the later editions, particularly in his narrative of the reign of Elizabeth, Hume frequently divides an original long paragraph into two or more shorter paragraphs, again in an attempt to facilitate the task of the reader. Hume "corrects" both the language and the textual appearance of his work. The revisions, then, are the product of research and authorial assertion, but also of responses to criticism. They involve Hume in a retreat from his aggressive position on religion, and in a development of his sympathy for the Stuarts. Hume preferred to present himself revising the politics of the History , rather than altering his earlier presentation of religion. He had little to say in his correspondence about the "retrenchment" of his treatment of religion, casting himself rather as the fearlessly independent writer whose righteous anger against the politicians and hacks who criticised his History may indeed have led him into revisionary overreaction (see Letters 2.216). Such was a far more flattering self-image than that of the author who recast important sections of the first volume of his History in the face of sustained opposition. Even as he approached his death, Hume wished to appear sturdily independent in all his dealings with his critics and his History . Home reported Hume returning to "the design to ruin him as an author": "he recurred to a subject not unfrequent with him—that is, the design to ruin him as an author, by the people that were ministers, at the first publication of his history; and called themselves Whigs, who, he said, were determined not to suffer truth to be told in England." 25 However, as we have seen, Hume's defiance in the face of a ministerial conspiracy was not the only aspect of his revisions of the History ; although it appears to have been an aspect which he "not infrequently" presented to his friends. The albeit rudimentary textual history of the History that has been presented in this study indicates some of the various ways in which an extremely influential work achieved its final, "authorised" state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The peculiar order of composition of the History was seized upon by Hume's critics, for instance Richard Hurd: "having undertaken to conjure up the spirit of absolute power, [Hume] judged it necessary to the charm, to reverse the order of things, and to evoke this frightful spectre (as witches use to say their prayers) backwards " ( Moral and Political Dialogues [London, 1761], "Postscript", quoted by Ernest Campbell Mossner, The Life of David Hume , 2nd ed. [1980] 302). 2 The editions of the History that I cite in this study are as follows: The History of Great Britain under the House of Stuart . 2 vols. Edinburgh, 1754; London, 1757. The History of Great Britain under the House of Stuart . Revised ed. 2 vols. London, 1759. The History of England under the House of Tudor . 2 vols. London, 1759. The History of England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Accession of Henry VII . 2 vols. London, 1762. The History of England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1668 . 6 vols. London, 1762. The History of England . 8 vols. London, 1763. The History of England . 8 vols. London, 1767. The History of England . 8 vols. London, 1770. The History of England . 8 vols. London, 1773. The History of England . 8 vols. London, 1778. When comparing editions I cite the date of the "original" edition (for example, 1762 in the case of the medieval volumes), and the date of the edition in which the relevant revision first appeared. Although the second volume of the History of Great Britain appeared at the end of 1756 I have referred to it throughout, in accordance with its title page, as the 1757 edition. Similarly, the medieval volumes were actually published in late 1761, but I cite them as the edition of 1762. 3 For an account of British editions of the History published in Hume's lifetime and posthumously see T. E. Jessop, A Bibliography of David Hume (1938) 28-32. No American edition of the History appeared in the eighteenth century; however, I have managed to trace thirty-one separate American editions published in the nineteenth century. 4 Hitherto the only study devoted to the revisions has been that of Ernest Campbell Mossner, "Was Hume a Tory Historian? Facts and Reconsiderations", JHI 2 (1941): 225-236. Mossner rejects the idea that Hume's revisions manifest Tory bias, and sees them as indicative of scepticism rather than dogmatism (233). Mossner's study, however, has several flaws. He draws his conclusions from a fairly small sample of revisions (148 variants), and his tabular analysis of the revisions is based on the rather simplistic categories of "Whig", "Tory" and "Neutral" (230). Mossner's terms suffer from an exclusive concentration upon the "politics", narrowly interpreted, of the History . Moreover, Mossner's bibliographical principles are themselves suspect, as the editions which are used for the purposes of collation are not in fact those cited in the "Table of Revisions" (230 n). Constant Noble Stockton, although employing a limited sample of the revisions, casts doubt on Mossner's findings in "Hume's Constitutional History," (Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont Graduate School, 1968) 244. Victor Wexler is aware of the significance of the revisions, and discusses aspects of them at various points in "David Hume: Historian" (Ph.D dissertation, Columbia Univ., 1971); he also deals briefly with examples of the process of revision in David Hume and the History of England (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1979) 15-17, and "David Hume's Discovery of a New scene of Historical Thought" ( Eighteenth Century Studies 10 (1976-77): 192-194. Duncan Forbes' discussion of the revisions in Hume's Philosophical Politics (1975) 324-326 is brief but thoughtful. Forbes also confines himself to a consideration of the political import of Hume's recastings, and decides that "in the last resort Hume does not radically alter his main thesis in spite of all the changes" (325). 5 I was assisted in this laborious task by the eighteenth century annotator—apparently the Rev. Charles Godwyn, Fellow of Balliol (see G. Birkbeck Hill, ed., Letters of David Hume to William Strahan [London, 1888] 6)—who noted many of the revisions made by Hume in the 1754 and 1757 editions held by the Bodleian. However, Godwyn seems to have compared only the 1759 edition with the two earlier volumes—thus not taking account of later revisions—and even in this comparison is not fully comprehensive. Certain of Hume's contemporaries were as fascinated as the author himself by the process of revision; there are also interlinear and marginal annotations in a Dublin edition of 1755 held by the British Library (annotations which are not by Hume himself, pace Victor Wexler, "David Hume: Historian" 145 n), and the Analytical Review 1 (1788) notes the existence of a similar "critical edition", "a most curious collation of the last octavo edition of the History of England with the first in quarto" owned by a Mr. Herbert Croft (297 n.). 6 T. C. Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel enter a similar caveat on the limitations of statistics in the study of revisions in "Richardson's Revisions of Pamela ", Studies in Bibliography 20 (1967): 62. 7 Boswell in Extremes, 1776-78, ed. Charles McC. Weis, Frederick A. Pottle (1971) 14. 8 The implications of Hume's attitudes to revision and print have received comparatively little attention; but Elizabeth Eisenstein has remarked that Hume's attitudes exemplify the process by which, through print, "the transmission of written records no longer reinforced the sense that corruption was an inevitable consequence of any sequence over time" ( The printing press as an agent of change: communications and cultural transformations in early-modern Europe [1979] 2.112). 9 John Hill Burton noted that Hume's "most brilliant passages are those which bear the least appearance of being amended" ( The Life and Correspondence of David Hume , 2 vols. [Edinburgh, 1846] 2.80-81). 10 The origins of the anecdote of Hume's reluctance to walk across his study to check a reference are obscure, but see for example Ernest Campbell Mossner, "An Apology for David Hume, Historian", PMLA 56 (1941): 682, and Victor G. Wexler, David Hume and the "History of England" 37. 11 The Letters of David Hume , ed. J. Y. T. Grieg (1932) 1.418. 12 Pace Forbes, 324, and Mossner, "Was Hume a Tory Historian", 230 n, the editions of 1763 and 1767 are not identical. 13 My Own Life (London, 1777) 24-25. 14 Daniel MacQueen, Letters on Mr. Hume's History of England (Edinburgh, 1756) 4. 15 For the difficulties encountered by the first volume of the History in the London publishing world, see Ernest Campbell Mossner and Harry Ransom, "Hume and the Conspiracy of the Booksellers", Univ. of Texas Studies in English 29 (1950), 162-182.

See Mossner, Life , 341-354, for the moves against Hume in the General Assembly and the Committee of Overtures of the Church of Scotland in 1755 and 1756. 20 See Letters 2.216, and New Letters of David Hume , ed. R. Klibansky, E. C. Mossner (1954) 69-70. 21 Edward Gibbon, The English Essays of Edward Gibbon , ed. Patricia B. Craddock (1972) 338. 22 A more immediate explanation for Hume's excision of his extravagant tributes to the Dutch republic might be the crisis of 1758, during which friction between England and the republic over the latter's status as neutral trading power nearly resulted in war. 23 Burton, 2.79-81, gives a list of some of the more common alterations made by Hume in his quest for correctness, and notes the contradiction between Hume's declared independence of interpretation and his obvious susceptibility to linguistic and stylistic criticisms (2.78-79). See also Thomas Ritchie, An Account of the Life and Writings of David Hume Esq . (London 1807) 351-368. 24 Ironically, Joseph Priestley used the History as a mine of linguistic error, citing dozens of Humean solecisms. Priestley apologised for having devoted such attention to Hume with reference to the historian's "great reputation" and refused to believe that "exactness in the punctillios of grammar was an object capable of giving [a man such as Hume] the least disturbance" ( The Rudiments of English Grammar [London, 1768] xiii).

      <field name="heading_text">The "Edwardses of Halifax" as Booksellers by Catalogue 1749-1835 by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Yorkshire family known as Edwards of Halifax was famous for almost a century in the book trade, first as provincial booksellers and publishers of growing ambition and success, then as bookbinders and book-decorators of extraordinary taste and originality, and finally as metropolitan booksellers and publishers at the head of the trade. 1 The title "Edwards of Halifax" applies primarily to the technique they invented and patented for painting under the surface of vellum—these distinctive bindings were apparently never signed, and, as we do not know precisely when or by whom they were made, we call them "Edwards of Halifax" bindings. The members of the family were close-knit: they assisted one another, published books jointly, and probably bound works in the same style. It is therefore convenient to refer to the family as Edwards of Halifax, even though three of its members moved to London, where they were remarkably successful, both in collecting and selling old books and in publishing illustrated books. James Edwards was perhaps the most important antiquarian bookseller of his time, 2 and his brother Richard was the sole publisher of the great folio edition of Young's Night Thoughts (1797) for which William Blake made his most ambitious series of book illustrations. 3 There were three generations of Edwardses active in the book trade in Halifax, as may be seen from the accompanying chart. The first and most shadowy of the Edwardses of Halifax is RICHARD Edwards (1691-1767), stationer and schoolmaster. His son WILLIAM Edwards (1722-1808) was a provincial publisher and a major bookseller who distributed important books across Britain from his Halifax bookshop, and he and his sons perfected techniques of vellum decoration and fore-edge painting which became famous in his day and remain so in ours. At least four of his sons followed him in the business: JAMES Edwards (1756-1816), JOHN Edwards (1758-91), THOMAS Edwards (1762-1834), and RICHARD Edwards (1768-1827). James and John first worked in the Halifax shop and then went to London in 1784 to set up a new business as Edwards &amp; Sons at 102 Pall Mall; John died in Paris in 1791; and James retired from the book-world in 1800, rich in honour and profit. Thomas continued with the Halifax shop until he wound it up about 1826. And Richard opened a third Edwards bookshop at 142 New Bond Street, London, about 1789, from which he retired in 1798 to take up a position with government in Minorca. Of these three bookshops in Halifax, in Pall Mall, and in New Bond Street, the most important were those in Halifax and Pall Mall; both issued major catalogues of antiquarian books, were widely known in the trade, and published books of some ambition. Richard Edwards in New Bond Street was altogether more humble in ambition and accomplishment; he produced no catalogue, he was only slightly known in the trade, and, apart from works in which he was only a minor member of a publishers' conger, his publications were unimportant religious and political pamphlets—with the exception of Young's Night Thoughts (1797). The catalogues published by William Edwards (1722-1808), by James Edwards (1756-1816), and by Thomas Edwards (1762-1834) provide much of the detailed information which survives about their activities as antiquarian booksellers and book-collectors and tell us a good deal about their publications, their bindings, and their fore-edge paintings. The catalogues are hard to find, and a number of them are known only from advertisements and correspondence. It is therefore worthwhile to assemble information about them here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Edwards's Auctions 1749-1760 Of Richard Edwards (?1691-1767), little is known other than that he was a schoolmaster and stationer. His son William (1722-1808) apparently started the family tradition of being simultaneously bookseller, bookbinder, and publisher. He was remarkable, early in life, for his great attention, industry, and application to his business, which were bookbinding and bookselling; in both of which he excelled almost every one of that branch, and particularly in the latter he has been noted the world around. . . . 4 [ He was ] a character of considerable eminence in his profession, and . . . The Catalogues which he occasionally published were astonishingly rich in scarce and valuable books; of which the ornamental bindings were peculiarly elegant. 5 He seems to have started selling books by auction about the same time (1749) as he commenced publishing. There are advertisements in the newspapers for seven sales by Edwards (sometimes William Edwards) in Halifax from 1749 through 1760; the first of these was in conjunction with the Halifax bookseller Nathanial Binns, and the rest were by Edwards alone. No surviving catalogue has been traced, so little can be learnt of these sales. In particular, it is difficult to gauge how extensive they were, for at least two sales of books (those of 1749 and 1759) began on a specified date and continued "every Evening till they were Sold". Only one collector is named in the advertisements, and the contents are described merely as "Choice and valuable Books" or as "Books on Divinity, History, Law, Physick, Antiquities, Voyages, Travels, and Miscellanies", a common country gentleman's range of interests. The sales did not take place in Edwards's shop or in a regular auction room but at The Old Cock Inn in Halifax. Edwards does not seem to have acted as agent for the vendors, taking a percentage of the prices at which the works were sold, as an ordinary auctioneer might do. Instead, he seems to have sold his own books at auction, presumably as a way of realizing cash on them more quickly than he could in his shop. At any rate, at his auction of 1760 he sold "part of several libraries lately purchased", indicating that they had already been paid for, presumably by the auctioneer. The sales are infrequent, not quite one a year from 1754 through 1760, mostly in the autumn, and it is likely that they served primarily as a priming-device for William Edwards's secondhand book business, drawing attention to it, bringing in sudden infusions of money, and making it possible for him to purchase stock on a larger scale, sometimes whole libraries at a time, such as that of the Rev. Mr. Nathaniel Makant in 1754. The William Edwards auctions thus far recorded cover only 1749-1760; 6 apparently when he became firmly established as a bookseller he discontinued the practice. So far as I have ascertained, William Edwards never issued a catalogue of the stock of his shop. For that matter, neither did his son Richard. It was only his most successful sons James and Thomas who published catalogues of their book-stock. James did so almost as soon as he had established himself in London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Edwards's Shop-Catalogues When James and John Edwards came to London in 1784, they established themselves in fashionable premises at 102 Pall Mall, and this is the address given on their catalogues from January 1785 through 1791. 7 In 1794 James Edwards moved to what is now 70 Pall Mall, and he paid the rates there until 1810, 8 though by the end of that time he had moved to Harrow. His catalogue of 1794 gives the address as 78 Pall Mall and that of 1796 as 77 Pall Mall-perhaps one number was a mistake, or perhaps the building was re-numbered in the interim. The shop quickly attracted both the learned and the fashionable. According to the bibliographical anecdotalist William Below, who was almost his exact contemporary, James Edwards was the introducer of a new æra, in the profession. . . . [ He ] was the first person who professedly [ sic ] displayed in the metropolis shelves of valuable books in splendid bindings, and having taken a large house in one of the most frequented and fashionable streets, it soon became the resort of the gay morning loungers of both sexes. At the same time also invitation was held out to students and scholars, and persons of real taste, from the opportunity of seeing and examining the most curious and rare books, manuscripts, and missals. His manners were as attractive as his manuscripts, and He became a sort of literary oracle, and was consulted by the grave and the gay, the lively and severe, the scholar and the sciolist; and truth to say, his manner was so inimitably fine, that he had as much to say on an illuminated missal, and an Etruscan vase, as on the books printed at the Sabiaco monastery, or the Florence Homer of 1488. . . . [ He ] was both courteous and courtier-like. They who were less favorably inclined towards him, complained that his enunciation was affectedly soft, and that he had too much of the air and grimaces of a Frenchman; and by the shrug of his shoulders, and his facility in speaking the language, has more than once been mistaken for a native of that country. But his peculiarities were harmless, [and] his knowledge of all the mysteries of his craft, more extensive, perhaps, than that of any of his contemporaries. . . . 9 James Edwards's first catalogue of his shop-stock established him immediately as among the most important antiquarian booksellers of his time, a time which was just beginning to indulge extensively a relish for fine books. The works most eagerly sought were incunabula, and the most anxious competition was over works printed on vellum and preserved in elegant bindings. Such works James Edwards from the first proved adept at securing, 10 and, equally important, he proved himself adept first in winning the confidence of major collectors and then in becoming friends with them. His first catalogue is thus described by the careful and responsible John Nichols: In 1784, when he [William Edwards] was 64 years of age, he settled his son James, with a younger brother (John), in Pall Mall; where, under the firm of Edwards and Sons , they published a Catalogue which astonished, not only the purchasers of books, but the most experienced and intelligent Booksellers in the Metropolis. Never, perhaps, was a collection more splendid, or more truly valuable, presented to the curious; and its success was proportionate to its merits. It was formed principally from the Libraries of N. Wilson, Esq. of Pontefract; two eminent Antiquaries, deceased; and H. Bradshaw, Esq. of Maple Hall, Cheshire. 11 It is surprising that no copy of this superlatively "splendid" and "truly valuable" catalogue has been traced. As a consequence of its rarity, its character and even date are uncertain. On 24 July 1784 James Edwards wrote to the ambitious bibliophile Richard Bull that Our Catalogue is with the Printers, but will not be ready in less than 2 or 3 months—one of the first shall certainly wait upon you— Among other articles are above 20 folio manuscripts of Heraldry. of w. ch many are Herald's Visitations, and 6 of those not known to M. r Gough— 12 perhaps the most complete Collection in the Kingdom of historical and Political papers of the Time of the Civil Wars of Cromwell's administration, having been collected by President Bradshaw's nephew—some of them by the President himself— 13 a few old Plays—Caxtons, and almost all the Old Chronicles, Dugdales Works, &amp; many County Books in the finest condition &amp;c— 14 This letter implies that the catalogue would not be finished before about October 1784. Since we know from newspaper advertisements that James Edwards's Catalogue of Books for "January 1785" was ready on 4 January 1785, and since it is unlikely that he had two major catalogues ready within three months, it seems probable that James Edwards's Catalogue mentioned in the advertisements is the same as the Edwards and Sons catalogue mentioned by Nichols; after all, James Edwards's Catalogue was "to be had of Edwards and Sons", among others, though the "Sons" mentioned here are Thomas and Richard in Halifax, rather than James and John in London. The first London catalogue was clearly seen as related to the Halifax shop, for not only was the first of its vendors named as Edwards and Sons, Halifax, but it was available "Also of the Booksellers at York, Leeds, Wakefield, Manchester and Rochdale", all of them much more in the sphere of influence of Halifax than in that of London. 15 Note that the advertisements speak vaguely of "above Thirty-Thousand . . . of the scarcest and most valuable Articles on various Subjects" and that the four libraries of which it was chiefly composed (according to Nichols) are not identified there. Further, the libraries, at least so far as they are described, are conspicuously English. Thereafter James Edwards secured his best books and reputation from the Continent, and he advertised both the gems of the collection and their immediate provenance in large letters. The "success" of the catalogue was apparently as "splendid" as its merit. James Edwards's reputation for taste, judgment, fair prices, and ability to produce remarkable books was firmly established by this 1785 catalogue, and he went on from success to success. In 1786 James Edwards outbid the agent of the King to secure the Bedford Book of Hours at £225.15.0, and "His fame as a Bibliographer was now completely established". 16 In all, he produced six catalogues of the stock of his shop, in January 1785, in May 1787, in 1789, in 1790, in 1794, and in 1796. These catalogues were available not only from the bookshop of James Edwards but also from those of Thomas Payne in Mews Gate (1785), of Joseph Johnson in Paternoster Row (1785, 1789, 1790), and of Edwards (and Sons) in Halifax (1785, 1787, 1789, 1790). Thereafter James Edwards felt able to stand on his own feet unaided, and his name alone appears on the catalogues of 1794 and 1796. It is striking that the name of James Robson, with whom he collaborated closely and continuously in his book-auction-catalogues, never appears on his shop-catalogues. His first shop-catalogues were not so much notices of what he had in his shop as they were advertisements of his acquisitions of whole libraries. The 1787 title-page mentions three libraries, though the former owner of only one is identified (J. Mainwaring). The books singled out are divided into two categories, Ancient and Modern. In the former category, attention is drawn to illuminated missals, manuscripts of English history, publications of Caxton and other printers of incunabula, books printed on vellum, and early chronicles, poetry, and topography. Among the best Modern Books, the ones considered worthy of special mention were works printed (at Horace Walpole's press) at Strawberry Hill, illustrated books on birds, insects, shells, vegetables, vases, archaeology, voyages, and fine art (Van Dyke, Claude, the Vatican ceiling), 17 many "in the most elegant Bindings". These elegant bindings were probably often in the style of Edwards of Halifax; at least one (No. 83) is said to be "bound in the Etruscan stile", which the Edwards binders had made peculiarly their own. The catalogue is clearly aimed not at country gentlemen but at cosmopolitan bibliophiles, though there are many novels in English, Italian, and French for the pleasure of the less discriminating. Edwards's next catalogue of about eighteen months later (1789) stressed on the title-page both Ancient and Modern Books as before, but the range of subjects was wider ("Every Branch of Pleasing and Useful Science"), and the focus of admiration was narrower, on Magnificent Books of Prints beautifully coloured and in elegant and splendid Bindings. It was half again as large as his previous catalogue (202 compared with 140 pages) and was the catalogue of his shop which pleased Edwards most: There was at this time an uncommon emulation between Egerton, White, Payne &amp; myself. Faulder was also pushing at a great rate. But what makes it more singular is, that I had only been abt. 5 years in London. It is printed with more attention to correctness than any other. This seems to be the best Cat. I ever made, being after my 2d. journey to Italy. At this day it surprises me. Jan 14, 1800 J.E. 18 The James Edwards catalogue of [?March] 1790 is similar to that of 1789, though larger (245 compared with 202 pages) and specifying on the title-page "the choicest part of the Libraries of Monsignor Salichetti, of Rome; of Cav. Zanetti, of Venice; and an Assortment of the rarest and most esteemed Articles collected in various Parts of Europe". This stress upon works bought on the Continent was of course particularly remarkable during the turmoil engendered by the French Revolution. It was the insecurity created by this turmoil which made it possible for Edwards to acquire such libraries so readily; according to William Beloe, "by following the rear of the French armies, he might on easy terms obtain his choice of what he most wanted . . .". 19 Some of these books acquired on the Continent were probably put into the elegant bindings advertised on the title-page after they reached England. After producing four catalogues of the stock available at his shop in six years (1785-90), Edwards waited four years before he published another. He was, of course, not idle during these years, for from 1789 through 1795 he collected works for six important auction sales (see below), mostly of works secured from the Continent. Probably he could not afford to finance these purchases by the slow, piecemeal sale of their contents, and the auction provided a quicker way of recovering his capital. The travels incident to acquiring these books and the labour of cataloguing them on his return, plus his vigorous publishing business being established at the same time, prevented him from making new catalogues of his shop-stock. These large catalogues of course required endless labour; on 20 December 1793 Edwards wrote to William Roscoe: "My Attention has been so wholly directed to a Catalogue for the last 6 M. s that I scarcely know how my regular Business has been going on". 20 The [January] 1794 Catalogue is yet larger than that of 1790 (320 compared with 245 pages), though there are about the same number of lots (almost 7,000). The title follows the 1790 formula, though it claims to be "A Very Select Collection" rather than merely "A Select Collection". The catalogue listed, inter alia, Chinese paintings, a Koran written in gold (No. 1,192), a manuscript collection of Persian poetry (No. 1,197), Didot's and Bodoni's splendid editions, coloured prints, incunabula, a receipt for £200,000 "for betraying Charles I", and numerous publications by James Edwards. It maintained the high standard of accuracy established in his earlier catalogues, and Thomas Frognall Dibdin quoted a description from it "out of respect to the bibliographical talents of Mr. Edwards. His catalogues are full of curiosities; and his descriptions of, and observations upon, rare and beautiful books, are accurate and interesting." 21 Edwards's last shop-catalogue, of [February] 1796, has the least exclamatory title-page, is about the same length as that of 1794 (316 compared with 314 pages), and has about ten percent more entries (7,743 compared with 6,694). It was apparently accompanied by engraved "specimens" which have not been traced. To a modern eye, the prices seem admirably modest: the second Shakespeare folio is offered at £3.3.0 (No. 962) and £1.5.0 (No. 963, lacking the title-page), and even incunabula are within reason, such as Gutenberg's Bible at £126 (No. 1). 22 English shop-catalogues before 1800 are not common. Those which James Edwards produced in 1787, 1789, 1790, 1794, and 1796 are among the most extensive and distinguished which survive. The amount of information given about books is surprisingly full, and the accuracy is in general admirable. James Edwards would be memorable for these shop-catalogues, even had he confined his work to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Edwards's Auction-Catalogues James Edwards was best known in his own time for the remarkable dash and skill with which he secured extraordinary books and even whole libraries from the Continent, often acting not far in front of the armies of revolutionary France. This was an area in which his family had not embarked before, and it required formidable financial resources, far beyond what we can reconstruct. 23 He must have had funds from powerful backers who believed in his book-selling genius, probably from wealthy bibliophiles and colleagues in the trade as well as more conventional sources. The four extensive English libraries he had acquired by the end of 1784 and sold successfully through his first catalogue of January 1785 demonstrated his capacity to deal with wholesale transactions, though the returns from the shop must have been comparatively slow, and in his 1787 catalogue he offered works from three more English libraries evidently acquired en bloc. Thereafter his attention was diverted steadily to Continental sources. By 1789 he had been twice to Italy and elsewhere on the Continent, scouring for books, and his ambition did not flinch at the prospect of acquiring even the largest and most distinguished libraries. Dibdin wrote of the Catalogue des Livres de la Bibliothèque de M. Pierre-Antoine Crevenna , 5 vols. (Amsterdam: chez D.J. Changuion &amp; P. den Hengst, 26 April-15 June 1790): "I possess an interesting copy of the small paper [issue], which has numerous marginal remarks in pencil, by Mr. Edwards; who examined the library at Amsterdam, with a view to purchase it entire." 24 This would have been an enormous undertaking, but not larger than others which he achieved. In the summer of 1787, James Edwards made a tour of France, Geneva, and Italy, searching for books with James Robson, Robson's kinsman Robert Faulder, and Peter Molini, with all of whom he later collaborated in publishing books, and in the diary which James Robson kept we can catch occasional glimpses of the pleasures, hazards, and book-successes of the journey. For instance, on Tuesday 31 July 1787 near Geneva we dine with Mr. Mange the Books[eller] &amp; to whom Mr. Barde his Partner had given us a particular recommendation at Paris. We call'd with him to his Villa about a Mile out of Town, &amp; were nobly entertained with a Trout of near 20 pounds from the Lake. The Evening we spent upon the Lake at His Father's Villa near Coppet, where the Setting Sun, &amp; rising Moon added every glory to the Spot, that could possibly enrich the Scene. Aug t 1st, Wednesday . . . we went to Mr. Manges, &amp; Mr. E[dwards] took some books of him. . . . [On Sunday August 5th] In turning upon one of the Bridges this morning about a post from our Inn [in St Michel] My Friend Edw[ard]s &amp; I had the misfortune to be overturned, &amp; if it had not been for the railing of the Bridge the Chaise might have gone compleatly into the River, rolling many feet beneath us amidst the rocks, &amp; the Affair been of some consequence: however thank God as we escaped unhurt, it passed off with our Companions as a Joke, who being some way before us came to our Assistance as soon as they could[.] We shall however remember Pont St. Andree , &amp; the good Saint I hope will be canonized for our preservation. . . . On August 14th they bought £50 worth of books from the Firmian Library in Milan—they had offered £450 for all the English books, but this was refused. Their visit which was most important in bibliographical terms was on Sunday August 26th: This morning we were appointed to meet Mr. Lanki the Proprietor of the Pinellian Library that has so long made so much noise in the World, &amp; wh. was one great cause of this Tour: we accordingly at Nine o'clock were introduced to him, by Abbe Morelli, who had taken the Catalogue; they both went with us to the House of the late Pinelli: The Books fill three or four Rooms compleatly, &amp; the Catalogue of them is composed in six volumes in Quarto. They are indeed curious &amp; valuable, and scarcely ever more of the 1400 [i.e., incunabula] were collected by one man, &amp; in excellent preservation. We spent four hours examining all that were strikingly curious, but found that the price expected for them was immense, &amp; rea[l]y double their value; 30000 Sequins was the Sum: we shall therefore decamp from Venice. However, on Wednesday the 29th they "b[ough]t a parcel of the 1400", and eventually they acquired the entire library by offering "a price [about £7,000] which the executors and trustees found it in their interest to accept". 25 The Gentleman's Magazine review of the Pinelli catalogue of Edwards &amp; Robson in January 1789 remarked that "it has been conveyed to England at the great hazard of the sea, during the late severe weather", and "From the unforeseen delay of the books the sale is now to begin [not on 2 March but] on the 20th of April with the second part first". 26 James Robson at the Three Feathers in New Bond Street worked closely with James Edwards throughout Edwards's career; as well as co-publishing with him a number of books, he appears on the title-page of all his book-auctions, at least as a vendor of the catalogue. The title-page of the 1789 Pinelli auction-catalogue calls attention to the "unparalleled Collection" of the classics, to incunabula printed on vellum, to manuscripts from the sixth to the sixteenth centuries, and to the " singularly fine Preservation " of the whole library. Oddly enough, the auctioneer is not identified in this or in any of Edwards's other auction-sales, but the address is given: The Great Room in Conduit Street, Hanover Square, where all his later London book-auctions were held. James Robson, Edwards's collaborator, in this sale, had a house in Conduit Street, and the sales were probably held there. 27 It seems likely that Edwards himself was the auctioneer. The making of the catalogue itself was comparatively simple, for it is " an exact Abridgement, merely for the purpose of sale by auction [of] The Catalogue of the Collection, published by the learned Abbe Morelli, in Six Volumes Octavo " (1787). 28 Its appeal to both classical scholars and Continental buyers is indicated by the prefatory matter in Latin, including even the "Ordo Venditionis". The catalogue had to be issued well in advance of the sale, so as to reach Continental customers in time; it was reviewed in the Analytical Review for October 1788, and the British Mercury for March 1789 announced that its publisher, Remnant of Hamburg, had for sale "a considerable Number" of copies of the Bibliotheca Pinelliana . Commencing at last on 20 April 1789, the main sale lasted sixty-one days (if the published sequence was followed), and the 12,859 lots realized £9,356. 29 So extensive was the library that an Appendix was subsequently compiled and issued free to the purchasers of the main catalogue. 30 This added sale lasted from 1 February through 9 March 1790, a further thirty-two days, with 5,722 more lots. The entire sale, lasting ninety-three days, was one of the greatest events of the English book-selling world of the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Bodley's librarian was so enthusiastic that he spent £500 at the Pinelli sale—and then asked for loans from colleges and individuals because the budget was overspent. 31 However, though the Pinelli sale confirmed the reputation of James Edwards, it did not go far toward establishing his finances, as he later told Lord Glenbervie: He says the Pinelli library cost him and Robson £10,000 before he had cleared it of expenses, duties, etc., and that he and Robson did not clear on the whole above £500 by it exclusive of the interest of their money. Many of the Italian books, such as local and provincial histories, antiquities, etc., were bought in and sold literally for waste paper, and in Italy they would have fetched a great deal of money. What brought them home was the classics. . . . Edwards said the great advantage he derived from the Pinelli Library was a skill of rare and valuable books; that Lord Spencer when he began collecting used to rely very much on the judgment of [Peter] Elmsley. 32 On 8 March 1790, James Edwards was also engaged in a curious sale of Imperial Gold Coins at his own bookshop at 102 Pall Mall. This was not an auction, for, according to the catalogue, there were "Prices Affixed to Each" coin, but the sale seems to have been limited to one day. The 400 lots were priced at 10 s. 6 d. to £31, and Edwards confidently expected them all to be sold immediately, for a note on the title-page verso said: "To prevent any suspicion of partiality, those who intend to become purchasers are desired to deliver in, on Saturday [6 March], lists of such Medals as they choose, and each list shall be supplied as fully as possible, in the order they shall stand as to value." This implies that the largest purchasers would get the earliest choices. Edwards's confidence in the success of this one-day sale of coins suggests that their value was determined largely by weight. I suspect that Edwards needed to raise money rapidly. I know of no other occasion on which he sold anything else but books, manuscripts, prints, and designs. One of the largest collections which Edwards helped to dispose of was that of the late Giovanni Battista Paitoni (1703-88) of Venice, which was sold for over forty-three days (9,754 lots) in two parts, from 22 November to 15 December 1790 and from 24 January to 17 February 1791. As with other book-auctions by Edwards, it was held at The Great Room in Conduit Street, Hanover Square, the catalogue was available from James Edwards of Pall Mall and James Robson of New Bond Street, and no auctioneer was named. Who owned the books at the time of the sale is not clear, but as the title-page of the Bibliotheca Paitoniana is very similar to that of the Bibliotheca Pinelliana, which was jointly purchased by Edwards and Robson, it seems reasonable to suppose that they shared the ownership of the Bibliotheca Paitoniana as well, though James Robson signed the Conditions of Sale. The Preface to the catalogue stated emphatically: "Too much, with Truth, cannot be said in Commendation of the Paitoni-Library; which, in Point of Choice, in most Branches of Science and Polite Literature, in various Languages, but more especially in Italian , is inferior to few; and, with respect to Condition, almost without Exception, is one of the finest ever offered to Public Sale" (p. [iii]). The most important section was that of "The Class of Italian Poetry, Novels and Miscellanies [ which ] is very complete; including all the best Writers, several of the rarest, and some of the earliest Editions. . . . Of the Italian Theatre there are about 1000 volumes" (pp. iv, v). Indeed, two of the Boccaccios are so rare that they are "not in the Pinelli Catalogue" (p. v). In all probability, Edwards and Robson were the chief suppliers of Italian books to the English market at this period; the Pinelli and Paitoni sales in 1789-91 lasted one hundred and thirty-six days and disposed of 28,335 lots of books. James Edwards crossed the Channel regularly even after the beginning of the French Revolution. These trips were mostly on his book business, finding new books to import and old libraries to acquire, though occasionally he had confidential government business as well. On 21 September 1790 he wrote to William Roscoe, who was compiling a life of Lorenzo de' Medici, of "a most Valuable Acquisition w. h I have made of the Library of the [ late ] Marquis de Paris of Paris—the most elegant &amp; Curious that were ever seen together . . . the Cat. shall be sent you soon —they will be sold by Auction at [the] end of next March . . .". And on 7 December 1790 he wrote again: "Besides M. r Paris', I have a smaller Library of choice Italian Literature coming". The identity of the former owners of these books is somewhat obscure. Jean Baptiste Pâris de Meyzieu, Marquis de Paris, died in 1778, and at least part of his library was sold in 1779. Some of the works sold by Edwards in 1791 had been bought after 1778, presumably by a member of the family, perhaps his nephew, and bound with the Pâris arms, but "the majority includes books which have nothing to do with any Pâris". 33 Perhaps the major collection of books in the 1791 sale was bought in France by M. Laurent, who is listed with Edwards on the auction-title-page—the owner is not mentioned in the "Avis au Public"—and Edwards may have been misled by the identification of several lots (e.g., No. 475, 486) in the French catalogue as from Mr. P's collection and by the ambiguous French title ( Bibliotheca . . . Parisina ). The supplementary "Grand Collection of choice Italian Literature" is identified in Edwards's preface as that of Claude d'Urfé, but it was in fact that of Cardinal de Loménie de Brienne. The identity of the second collection is made clear in a note of a conversation between Edwards and Lord Glenbervie on 23 October 1801: He says he gained £1,500 by the Paris Library. On his first expedition to Italy he says he found the Cardinal Loménie a very troublesome competitor; that, afterwards, on the Cardinal's retirement to Sens (having renounced his Hat and embraced the Revolution) he went to visit him there, when he offered to sell him his whole collection, which he declined, but made him an offer for a select part of it, the most curious, which was accepted, and I think he said he afterwards bought the natural history books; that the remainder was sold at Paris for more than they had cost. 34 The catalogue was issued in two forms and with three different titlepages. The first ( Bibliotheca Elegantissima, Parisina ) was in French, it was sold by M. Laurent in Paris and by Edwards in London, it gave the first day of sale as lundi 28 mars 1791, and it did not mention the place of sale (beyond "Londres") or where the books could be seen. The second catalogue ( Bibliotheca Parisiana ) was in English, and its integral title-page said that it was sold by M. Laurent in Paris, by Edwards in London, and by the principal booksellers throughout Europe, it corrected the date on which the sale began to Monday the 26th of March 1791, and it too neglected to mention where the sale was to be held (beyond "London") or where the books might be seen. Finally and tardily, an English cancel title was issued substituting James Robson in London for M. Laurent in Paris as vendor of the catalogue and giving at last the place of sale (The Great Room in Conduit Street), where presumably the books were also to be seen before the sale. The title-pages spoke of "Books of the Greatest Splendour and Rareness", many "Magnificently printed on Vellum", in the "finest [parfaite] Condition", in bindings "superlatively rich [avec un luxe extraordinaire]", consisting especially of classical authors, "manuscrits avec de superbes miniatures", and books of natural history with coloured engravings and the original designs. Some of the most remarkable books in this six-day sale were Aldine editions which probably came directly from Italy. Indeed, some of them manifestly did not arrive in London before the sale took place, and the English catalogue-descriptions were derived from information sent from abroad. One copy of the catalogue is inscribed: "Some of the Articles in this Catalogue, not having been received in due time, were sold [by Edwards &amp; Robson] with the books of Sig r Santorio of Venice, May 12th, 1791, &amp; the two following days". Some entries among these Aldines are ghosts, 35 and Renouard in his Catalogue de la Bibliothèque d'un Amateur (1819), IV, 258-259, commented: "C'est bien les plus fautif de tous les catalogues. On y estropie les titres, on y crée des éditions qui jamais n'existèrent". Considering the carefulness of most of Edwards's descriptions, it seems likely that the English catalogue descriptions of the ghosts, and perhaps of all the Aldines, derived from accounts sent him from the Continent of copies he had never seen. In his preface, Edwards said: "The collection exhibited in this catalogue is, for its number, by far the richest and most valuable ever offered to the Public. . . . most of them are bound by De Rome . . .". This view of its value was clearly accepted by contemporaries, for, according to the exclamatory Dibdin, on Monday 26 March 1791 there were to be seen the most notorious bibliomaniacs with blood inflamed and fancies intoxicated, rushing towards the examination of the truly matchless volumes contained within this collection. . . . the whole of Pall Mall was thronged with the carriages of collectors anxious to carry off in triumph some vellum copy of foreign extraction. . . . Since the days of Gaignat and the Duke de la Valliere, the longing eyes of bibliographers were never blessed with a sight of more splendid and choice books than those in the possession of M. Paris de Meyzieux. . . . having seen only these books out of the Paris collection, I hope to descend to my obscure grave in perfect peace and satisfaction! . . . we are indebted to the enterprising spirit and correct taste of Mr. Edwards for these, as well as many other, beautiful books imported from the Continent. 36 Clearly Edwards had judged his market very shrewdly. Cooperation between French and English booksellers was still possible in revolutionary times, for Edwards's next sale was actually held in Paris, on 12-14 May 1791. It consisted of the library of Signor Santorio, at least some of the books had been intended for the Parisina sale, and Edwards's partner was once again James Robson. The collection must have been extensive, for the sale lasted three days, but no catalogue seems to have survived, and we know of it only through chance references. The last auction which James Edwards managed himself was that of the libraries of the late William Wootton and a dead nobleman on 24 February-2 March 1795. The subjects of the books were the conventional ones of an English gentleman, with English history, classics, books of prints, and natural history, but they were "all in the best and finest condition", and the whole was "supposed equal in value (for the quantity) to any ever offered to public Sale". Edwards and Robson were joined as catalogue vendors by the booksellers Thomas Payne and Benjamin White, whom Edwards had described as "pushing at a great rate" in the antiquarian book field, and perhaps the sale was a joint venture of the four of them. No catalogue seems to have survived, and the sale is known only from an advertisement. James Edwards conducted no more sales himself, but he did have a number of important sales through established auctioneers. The first of these sales was, like Edwards's earlier ones, composed of works from one major library, in this case "From a monastery at Bamberg". According to The Monthly Mirror for April 1798 (Vol. V, p. 230), "EDWARDS, in Pall Mall, is just returned from Italy, where he has purchased many rare and magnificent editions of the classics; he is preparing a catalogue, which is expected to be perfectly unique ". Note that Edwards himself "is preparing a catalogue", even though the anonymous sale on 15 June 1799 was by Leigh &amp; Sotheby. Presumably under such conditions, the auctioneer's percentage was reduced a good deal. The sale was apparently not a success, totalling only £156.5.0, not much more than the two Aldines realized at the Santorio sale in Paris in May 1791. John Nichols commented on James Edwards's short career, "some fortunate purchases on the Continent soon filled up the measure of fortune which his unambitious mind and strong natural sense informed him, was sufficient for all the rational requirements of life." 37 He was ready to use his leisure for further bibliographical work, for Joseph Farington's Diary for 3 July 1801 records that "The [Royal Academy] Council last night . . . resolved to appoint Edwards of Pallmall to arrange and make out a catalogue of the R. Academy", 38 but A Catalogue of the Library of the Royal Academy, London (1802) contains no reference to Edwards. And, not surprisingly, he continued his avocations of collecting books and helping friends to do so: He continued now and then, at intervals, by way of amusement, and at the desire of friends, to dabble a little in the way of his former occupation, and was said, on some critical occasion, to have made a trip to the Continent, partly on the account of declining health, and partly to avail himself of a tempting opportunity to pick and choose, from a very select collection of rare things in his way . 39 When James Edwards gave up business about 1800, he must have turned over most of his new and antiquarian stock to his successor in Pall Mall, R. H. Evans. 40 When his business interests were wound up and he was "Retiring into the Country" as "A Gentleman of Distinguished Taste", he sold part of his private collection anonymously at Christie's on 25-28 April 1804. The title-page describes it as "A Splendid Collection", and the books are indeed extraordinarily luxurious. Numbers are "unique", extra-illustrated with original drawings, proofs, etc., printed on vellum, and "superbly" or "sumptuously bound". Probably Edwards had acquired from friendly publishers works such as the Large Paper copy of Hunter's Travels through France, Turkey, Hungary (1803) with coloured plates of which "there were none printed for sale" (No. 138), or the "unique" copies of Bulmer's editions of Goldsmith and Parnell's Poems (1795) and Somervile's Chase (1796) printed on vellum (No. 251-252). Indeed, it seems probable that such vellum copies were printed specially for Edwards. The dates of the books in the sale range from the sixteenth century to 1803, there are a number of Strawberry Hill publications, and the plays include King Lear (1608), Romeo and Juliet (1609), "exceedingly rare" [£4.18.0], Hamlet (1611), and Pericles (1611), as well as all four Shakespeare folios uniformly bound (No. 94-97, 220 [£73. 10.0]). And these of course were just the ephemeral works from his library which he did not care to move into the country. He sold the rest of his books, under his own name, through his successor R. H. Evans on 5-8, 10-11 April 1815. In his long account of the Sale of Mr. Edwards's Library, Dibdin says that Edwards took a house in town for the season, "and day after day did the owner and the vendor of the library communicate, consult, and proceed to work, in the formation of the catalogue for sale. . . . [The Catalogue] was left exclusively, as to the description of the volumes, to the efficient pen of Mr. Evans. . .". 41 Since Edwards helped Evans with some aspects of the catalogue, he may have had a hand with the title-page, which speaks of the "Splendid Assemblage of Early Printed Books, Chiefly upon Vellum", of "Important Manuscripts, Many of Them Executed for Sovereign Princes", of "Magnificent Books of Prints", and of "Fine Greek Vases". There were 830 lots of manuscripts and books plus nine of Greek vases (£2.2.0 to £700). 42 They include many of Edwards's own publications in remarkable states, coloured, on Large Paper, &amp;c., and there were remarkable works of wider interest, such as Opera di Piranesi, "very first impressions of the plates , selected by Mr. E." (No. 211 [£315]); Livy (1469), "the only copy . . . known to exist upon vellum" (No. 278 [£903]); Biblia Pauperum (1440-50) (No. 804 [£210]); Evangeli Quatuor Graece (10th Century) (No. 821 [£210]); and the famous Bedford Missal (No. 830 [£687.15.0]). As a note on No. 809 remarked, "Mr. Edwards . . . from his valuable and extensive correspondence on the continent, obtained more early printed books than were ever imported by any one individnal [ sic ]". The total was £9,795.18.0, and the average was almost £10 per book, which Dibdin calls "a result, unprecedented in the annals of book-sales". 43 The sale roused Dibdin to a frenzy of admiration, and in his Bibliographical Decameron (1817) he saluted Rinaldo: the wealthy, the fortunate, the heroic. I say heroic, because, at a moment [April 1815] when the ports of France and Holland were shut against us—and possessing books which were marketable articles abroad—he [ yet ] chose to bring his precious library to the hammer of Mr Evans [in London]. . . . Never was there a braver spirit evinced in the acquisition of precious tomes . . . it cannot be denied that in the art, craft, and mystery of Bibliopolism, no man ever did such wonderful things towards the acquisition of rare, beautiful, and truly classical [books as James Edwards.] Of all book-sales, Dibdin liked best "the last day of the sale of the library of RINALDO". 44 Very shortly after this sale, Edwards died, and presumably his property went to his widow. There were only three more sales of his property, each rather surprising. On 15 July 1820 Christie sold "Original Miniatures of the Stuart Family" belonging to J. Edwards (No. 69-94, £262.10.0) and gave something of their history. The miniatures were sold again by order of the assignees at Christie's on 3 February 1827 to the Rev. Mr Thomas Butt of Kinnersley, Shropshire, who had married James Edwards's widow in November 1820. 45 They stayed in the family until 13 June 1928, when they were sold at Christie's (No. 45-54) for the late Captain J.H. Edwards-Heathcote, the great grandson of James Edwards. The last catalogue explained that at the Glorious Revolution of 1688, these miniatures had gone into exile with James II, and, at his temporary home at St Germain as the guest of Louis XIV, James had given them to his host. In 1801 they were given by George John Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, bibliophile and First Lord of the Admirality (1794-February 1801) to James Edwards "in return for a [secret] Diplomatic Mission to France". 46 James Edwards's excellent connections in both France and England had served more causes than that of bibliography.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Edwards's Sales Catalogues As a provincial bookseller and publisher, Thomas Edwards is an altogether more shadowy figure than his brother James in London. He was, however, a bookseller of some importance, as his dozen or so sales catalogues demonstrate. Of the first two, a shop-catalogue of books in April 1812 and another in May 1812 of prints, drawings, and pictures, we know only from a manuscript letter. The third is a shop-catalogue of August 1815 specializing in law and jurisprudence (516 lots) and medicine (918 lots). Much more ambitious was his general catalogue in 1815 of "Books, in Most Languages, and Every Branch of Literature", Part I. The reference to "Unique and Splendid Articles, collected from various Parts of Europe . . . many in elegant Bindings", makes it sound like the stock of his brother James; certainly it listed many publications by James and Richard Edwards and books superbly bound [by Edwards of Halifax] in Etruscan calf (e.g., No. 1,285). Part II, the Appendix and Supplement, appeared in 1816 " Containing all the rarest Articles from the Cabinet of an Eminent Collector ", unfortunately unnamed. The titlepage stressed French books, emblem books, incunabula, and illuminated missals, as well as works in mathematics, law, medicine, arts and sciences, perhaps from his general stock. It cannot have been easy to sell bibliographical treasures in Halifax, and most of the rest of Thomas Edwards's catalogues were of auctions in London and Manchester. The first of these was the anonymous sale by Saunders in London on 30 March-16 April 1818 of some of the more remarkable books in his stock—2,232 lots in all, over sixteen days. The title-page described it as " one of the most rich and splendid Collections ever submitted to the Public ", singling out particularly the bindings of unusual taste and splendour. Some of these were in the Edwards of Halifax Etruscan style. Thomas Edwards's last shop-catalogue was issued in 1821, but it is so fugitive that only one copy has been traced. 47 It listed over three thousand works, including at least ten with Edwards fore-edge paintings, and the 537 drawings (£300) which William Blake had made for the edition of Young's Night Thoughts published by Thomas's brother Richard Edwards in 1797. But the Blakes were unsaleable at £300 or anything like it, and this and others of Thomas Edwards's best works proved to be too good for his market. Five years later Thomas Edwards had determined on retiring from business, and he printed in Halifax two catalogues of selections from his stock in trade which were sold at auction by Thomas Winstanley &amp; Co. in Manchester, the first of books on 1-2 May 1826 and the second of art works on 15-16 May. The first covered the standard antiquarian bookseller's range of "The Best Works in Divinity, Poetry, . . . Belles Lettres, . . . History, Biography, Topography, Antiquities, Voyages and Travels, . . . Natural History and Botany, . . . Encyclopedias, . . . Books of Prints, and . . . Illuminated Missals", plus the best recent works, especially those "Richly Illustrated with Plates". These modern works included many publications by James, Richard, and Thomas Edwards. The text drew attention particularly to the "splendid, costly" bindings in which "The greater part" of the collection of 1,465 lots were bound-an extraordinary claim: "In the superintendance of this department [ Etruscan bindings, . . . with matchless and unique Drawings on the leaves ], the utmost care and expence has been lavished on the part of Mr. Edwards . . . . it is seldom that a collection is seen altogether, displaying, in its binding, . . . such general excellence and perfection of the Art" (p. iv). Among the rest was the set of Blake's Night Thoughts drawings (No. 1,076), which had not sold at £300 in 1821 and which did not meet its reserve of £50 in 1826. The sale was a failure, and most of the items were withdrawn and placed in private sale. A notice was circulated about the SALE OF MR EDWARDS'S STOCK, EXCHANGE ROOMS. Mr Edwards having been disappointed in his endeavours to effect a Sale by Auction, of his Stock of Books, which disappointment he attributes to the unforeseen and unpropitious state of the times, respectfully announces that he has given directions to MESSRS WINSTANLEY &amp; CO. to discontinue the public Sale ; and that the remaining part of the Books described in the sale Catalogue, with others of a high value and consequence, will be on PRIVATE SALE in the Large Rooms in the Exchange Buildings, from Ten o'Clock to Six each Day. Mr Edwards, with a view of meeting the wishes of the public, adopted the above measures; and as he is about to retire from Business, he is prepared to make considerable sacrifices to effect the purpose of disposing of his Stock. A Catalogue is left in the hands of Messrs Winstanley &amp; Co. at the Rooms , in which is marked the lowest price that will be taken for each Book. Manchester, 5th May , 1826. 48 Winstanley seems to have provided a shop sale for the books Thomas Edwards had brought to Manchester and been unable to sell at auction. The art sale of 15-16 May 1826 consisted of engravings, drawings, oil paintings, painted glass, and carvings on ivory; the extensive title-page drew attention particularly to works of the modern English school of engravers and to the modern English drawings, and one suspects that at least some of them had passed to Thomas Edwards in Halifax from his brothers James Edwards and Richard Edwards in London, as Blake's Night Thoughts drawings had. By 1828 Thomas Edwards had left Halifax, and what appears to be the last of his shop-stock was sold in London by Stewart, Wheatley, &amp; Adlard on 15-24 May 1828. 49 It was described as "One of the most magnificent Assemblages of Missals, Illuminated Manuscripts, and Illustrated Books ever offered for public Sale", being especially strong in English and classical literature and fine bindings, including Etruscan bindings. It realized £4,640.6.6, but Blake's Night Thoughts drawings were bought in at £52.10.0—and apparently have not since been offered at public sale. 50 Finally Thomas Edwards's personal library, along with that of the late John Bowden, was sold by Southgate &amp; Son, London, on 9-16 March 1835. Unfortunately the catalogue does not indicate which books belonged to Thomas Edwards and which to Bowden. This is the last catalogue in which books from the family of Edwards of Halifax were gathered for sale. The shop- and auction-catalogues of the various branches of the firm of Edwards of Halifax span almost a hundred years (1749-1835) and indicate the growth and resources of a remarkable family book business. Through them we can also glimpse the development from provincial to metropolitan standards and the development of the antiquarian book-trade from casual adolescence into responsible maturity. Just as book-publishers developed from being socially negligible shopmen in the seventeenth century to patrons of literature in the eighteenth, antiquarian booksellers grew from being dealers in dusty used books before about 1760 to being the acquaintances and the friends of the rich and the great thereafter. The development from Pope's scurrilous Curll in the 1720s to Dr Johnson's patron Edward Cave in the 1740s to Cowper's friend and Mary Wollstonecraft's mentor Joseph Johnson in the 1780s is paralleled by the development from William Edwards as a provincial bookseller in the 1750s, none of whose catalogues seems to survive, to his son James Edwards in the 1780s, who outbid his king for books, who bought and sold libraries which were the envy of all Europe, who was the friend of Lord Orford (Horace Walpole) and of Earl Spencer, and who declined payment in gold for secret services to his country. It is a long road from Edmund Curll grovelling in Pope's mire to James Edwards, cultivated by noblemen and thanked by Government. The mapping of much of the end of this route is made possible by the Edwards of Halifax catalogues. These catalogues are the chief means we have of knowing about some of the most enterprising and successful antiquarian booksellers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they also throw valuable light upon their activities as bookbinders, fore-edge-painters, and publishers. They have been treasured by specialist collectors and scholars for two hundred years and more—and yet it is remarkable that, of the thirty-seven catalogues of which we have record, only twenty-four have survived, or at least have come to my attention. Of thirteen catalogues, there is now no trace, 51 yet some at least of these missing catalogues were considered by contemporaries to be of major importance. Book-sale catalogues are of great interest to historians of the book-trade, and only recently have a few enlightened libraries besides Bodley and the British Library actively searched out and eagerly welcomed such works. Their riches may have been too tardily recognized. Something at least of the riches of the catalogues of Edwards of Halifax has been mooted here.</field>

The Bibliotheca Parisiana was reviewed with praise for Edwards in the Analytical Review , VIII (Nov 1790), 341-343. According to T.H. Horne ( Introduction [1814], II, 716): "The English catalogue was executed by Mr. Edwards, of Pall-Mall . . . it is beautifully printed on fine vellum paper, and is, perhaps, more valuable as a book of reference than the French catalogue, as many of the articles are described more in detail, and some exceedingly rare and curious works are noticed for the first time. A few copies of the French catalogue were struck off on vellum paper, and one copy on quarto; some copies have double prices, of valuation and sale; these are both rare and dear". The average price was £14 per "article". Library of Signor Santorio (1791) TITLE: The Library of Signor Santorio intended to be sold at Paris on 12-14 May 1791 by [James] Edwards and [James] Robson.

NOTE: The lots are not distinguished as to owner. MR EDWARDS OF GREAT ST HELEN'S, BISHOPSGATE, AUCTIONEER Mr Edwards of Great St Helens, Bishopsgate, London, conducted occasional one-day auctions at Tom's Coffee-House, Cornhill, at least from 1798 through 1800. The catalogues are trifling affairs, four to seven pages long with about a hundred lots of paintings, jewelry, books, wine, olives, &amp;c., described with wonderful vagueness. No Christian name of the auctioneer is ever vouchsafed in the catalogues and advertisements I have seen. There is no reason to suppose that this Mr Edwards is related to the Edwards family of Halifax; his sales are listed here merely to distinguish them from those of the relevant Edwardses. 1798 July 12 Pictures from the Seat in Surrey of a Person of Distinction. 1799 July 18 Pictures of John Farrow, of Upper Brooke-Street, Deceased. 1799 October 11 Paintings, Bronzes, &amp;c., of a Gentleman Going to India, removed from his Dwelling-House at Richmond Green. 1799 October 17 Books and Mathematical and Musical Instruments of the same Gentleman. 1800 January 17 Paintings, Wine [and Olives] of William Finch, sold by Mess.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Most of the accounts of Edwards of Halifax concern their work as bookbinders. The most important scholarship is that of T. W. Hanson, "'Edwards of Halifax': [A Family of] Book-Sellers, Collectors, and Book-Binders", Halifax Guardian , Dec 1912, Jan 1913, reprinted in Papers, Reports, &amp;c., Read before the Halifax Antiquarian Society, 1912 (Halifax [1913]), 142-200; "Richard Edwards, Publisher", Times Literary Supplement , 8 Aug 1942, P. 396; and collections for his incomplete book on Edwards of Halifax (called Hanson MS here) now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Many of the facts cited here were first encountered in this last collection. 2 See "The Edwardses of Halifax and Bibliomania", Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , XI (1989), 141-156. 3 See "Richard Edwards, Publisher of Church-and-King Pamphlets and of William Blake", Studies in Bibliography , XLI (1988), 283-315. 4 Premature obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine , LIV (March 1784), 238; it was followed by an apologetic notice next month (P. 315): "Mr. Edwards, bookseller, of Leeds [ sic ], is not dead, as mentioned in our last, p. 238.—We shall use more caution in inserting articles from country news-papers, where they are not unfrequently inserted to serve a particular purpose, without regard to truth." 5 Gentleman's Magazine , LXXVIII (Jan 1808), 92; like the other passages in the Gentleman's Magazine about the family quoted here, it is repeated with little in the way of change or acknowledgement in John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , III (1812), 422, &amp;c.; in John Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century , IV (1822), 881-884; and in C. H. Timperley, A Dictionary of Printers and Printing (1839), 832. The last sentence in the quotation above was added in Nichols, Literary Anecdotes , III (1812), 422. 6 For detailed information on all the catalogues discussed here, see the Bibliography of Edwards Catalogues below. 7 The auction catalogues of Pinelli (1789) and Wootton (1795) give only Pall Mall, without a number. Note that the title-pages name the proprietor only as J. Edwards or as Mr. Edwards, though that of 1785 begins "James Edwards Catalogue". 8 London County Council, Survey of London , XXIX (1960), 380. 9 [William Beloe (1756-1817)] The Sexagenarian ; or, The Recollections of a Literary Life, Second Edition (1818), II, 279, 278; "the Exotic Bookseller" (described on pp. 277-282) is clearly James Edwards, for his father was "the inventor" of fore-edge paintings "in a remote provincial town", and, when the Exotic Bookseller retired, he "married, and became a country gentleman", as James Edwards did. 10 James Edwards's fascination with vellum copies is indicated by the note he made in his copy of Anacreon, Conviali Semiiambia [ed. J. Spaletti] (Roma, 1781): "This Copy of the Roman Anacreon is unique as printed upon vellum, and the paintings executed . . . at a very great expense. The publisher would never fix any price upon it during his lifetime, I bought it at Rome after his decease in 1796 and believe it to be the finest Book printed upon vellum with miniatures that exists" (Sotheby miscellaneous book-sale 1 Aug 1935, lot 112). 11 Gentleman's Magazine , LXXXVI (1816), 180 (obituary of James Edwards). Note that the advertisement of the catalogue (which is all we know of the title) mentions neither Edwards and Sons of London nor John Edwards. 12 Edwards clearly consulted Richard Gough (1735-1809), the principal antiquary of his time, about the books in his catalogue, as it contained just the kinds of work which most interested Gough. 13 John Bradshaw (1602-59), President of the Parliamentary Commission which tried Charles I and others, left his property to his nephew Henry Bradshaw (d. 1698), but it was confiscated by the Crown after the Restoration. Henry Bradshaw's property had apparently descended to H. Bradshaw of Maple Hall, Cheshire, as mentioned by Nichols. Hanson, MS, p. 43, remarks that "A huge proportion" of President Bradshaw's "papers" went to Lewis Montolieu, who sold a collection of 2,000 Commonwealth and Restoration pamphlets in 65 quarto volumes "formed . . . by the President Bradshawe, and . . . his Heirs" anonymously at Christie's, 13 Dec 1809, for £77.11.0. 14 Quoted from a reproduction of the manuscript in the Lewis Walpole Library (Farmington, Connecticut) of Yale University. 15 Of course, this emphasis upon northern cities may be simply because the 1785 title is known only from advertisements in Leeds and Manchester newspapers. However, as the ads name two London booksellers besides Edwards, they probably did not omit other booksellers in cities more fashionable than Leeds and Manchester; such names would in any case have given the catalogue more cachet. 16 Gentleman's Magazine , LXXXVI (1816), 180. 17 Note that the illustrated books of voyages, insects, archaeology, birds, and fine art were exactly the sorts of work which Edwards was to publish himself. 18 A note made by Edwards in his own copy of the catalogue, according to Hanson MS, p. 103. Benjamin White (1725-94) was a good deal older than James Edwards, but Thomas Payne (1752-1831), Robert Faulder (fl. 1779-1811), and Thomas Egerton (fl. 1784-1830) were about the same age. 19 Beloe, Sexegenarian , 279. 20 Quoted, like the other Roscoe correspondence here, from a reproduction of the MS in the Roscoe Collection of Liverpool Public Library. 21 T. F. Dibdin, Specimen Bibliothecœ Britannicœ (1808), 31. 22 This may be the copy which David Steuart acquired by 1796 and gave to the Advocates' Library in 1806—see Brian Hillyard, "History of the National Library of Scotland's 42-line Bible", Bibliothek : A Scottish Journal of Bibliography and Allied Topics, XII (1985), 113-117. 23 Finance may have been supplied by a shadowy connection of the family, John Edwards (1745-1819), the son of John Edwards (1706-93) of Lisbon, who retired with a fortune to Northowram Hall near Halifax in 1808, and apparently acquired the house at Harrow of his cousin James Edwards and proposed marriage to his widow between 1816, when James Edwards died, and 1819, when John Edwards died (according to C. J. Weber, A Thousand and One Fore-Edge Paintings [1949], 30). Beloe says that James Edwards set out on his first "circuit of Europe . . . with abundance of money" (II, 278). 24 Dibdin, Bibliomania (1811), 106. When this copy was sold by Evans with "the Library of an Eminent Bibliographer" on 26-28 June 1817, lot 261, it was described as "formerly Mr. Edwards's copy, who has marked the condition of each article in pencil in the margin". 25 George Smith and Frank Benger, The Oldest London Bookshop (1928), 43-47. There were about 1,150 incunabula in the Pinelli Library. 26 Gentleman's Magazine , LIX (Jan 1789), 69-70, erroneously specifying that the final offer was made "immediately". The phrase in the Gentleman's Magazine is repeated in John Nichols, Illustrations , IV (1822), 881, but the date is given wrongly as "1788". The Gentleman's Magazine reviewer remarked: "The importation of such a collection of books into this country reflects honour on the booksellers who have engaged in it, who, we understand, are Messieurs Robson and Edwards, who undertook a journey to Venice on purpose to examine it". This information is not in the catalogue. According to William Blades, The Enemies of Books (1896), 20, the fleet bearing the Pinelli library was "Pursued by Corsairs, one of the vessels was captured, but the pirate, disgusted at not finding treasure, threw all the books into the sea. The other two vessels escaped and delivered their freight safely . . .". However, this high-jacked cargo is an earlier Pinelli Library; the episode is described in a letter of 21 February 1609 (Marcella Grendler, "A Greek Collection in Padua: The Library of Gian Vincenzo Pinelli [1535-1601]", Renaissance Quarterly , XXXIII [1980], 389). 27 This is the same address as The Turf Gallery where Robson sold the Library of Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans, on 18 June 1796 (according to G. Smith and F. Benger, The Oldest London Bookshop [1928], 54), and the Bibliotheca Woottoniana on 24 Feb-2 March 1795 ( q.v. ). 28 P. [vii]; according to The Dictionary of National Biography , the catalogue-maker was Dr Johnson's friend Samuel Paterson (1728-1802), the auctioneer and bookseller. Hanson MSS, p. 74, says that Paterson wrote to say that if he had been given time he could have made a creditable catalogue, "But as so many difficulties and objections are started which it is out of the power of man to answer, I beg to decline a task where there is no likelihood of satisfying my employers". 29 C. H. Timperley, A Dictionary of Printers and Printing (1839), 825. This sum "barely repaid the expense of purchase; including duties, carriage, and sale", according to T. F. Dibdin, Bibliomania (1811), 122. 30 According to advertisements in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum collection of "Presscuttings from English newspapers etc. 1686-1835", I, 512, 590; see also I, 343, 347, 513. In 1791 James Robson issued a Catalogue of Books . . . Comprehending Also the Valuable Articles at the Pinelli Sale, intended for Abroad ; perhaps these were lots which Robson had bought in. (There is no special Pinelli section in this Robson catalogue.) 31 Ian Philip, "The Background of the Bodleian Purchases of Incunabula at the Pinelli and Crevenna Sales", Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , VII (1979), 369-375. Earl Spencer bought 266 lots (£294.3.0) through James Robson (Anthony Lister, "George John, and Earl Spencer, and his 'Librarian', Thomas Frognall Dibdin", in Bibliophily , ed. R. Myers &amp; M. Harris [1986], 92.) 32 The Diaries of Sylvester Douglas ( Lord Glenbervie ), ed. Francis Bickley (1928), 264, 265. 33 Arthur Rau, "Bibliotheca Parisina", Book Collector , XVIII (1969), 307-317. Hanson MSS, p. 87, cites (without locating) a copy of the French catalogue in which a hundred lots are identified as "Not Arriv'd", "N.A.", "missing", and simply not priced. 34 Glenbervie, Diaries (1928), I, 264. 35 Lots 18, 171, 206 ("This edition is so scarce as to have escaped the observation of all Bibliographers"), 223, and 526. 36 T. F. Dibdin, Bibliomania (1811), 544-546, 121; Dibdin lists some notable books and prices (pp. 543-548n). The Rev. Joseph Stirling wrote to Bishop Percy on 10 April 1791: "The celebrated Bibliotheca Parisiana was sold last week; about six hundred articles produced near 7,000 l., an unheard of thing in the annals of literature. . . . A Mr. [ Thomas ] Johnes, Member for Radnorshire, was the most considerable purchaser at the Parisiana. I dare say his bill came to near 2,000 l." Hanson MSS, p. 86, remarks that James Edwards's shop assistant Charles Barron (who signed his business letters when Edwards was abroad in 1796) bought in a number of inexpensive items and also some dear ones, such as No. 605, Recueil de Peintures bound by De Rome (£191.2.0) which reappeared in Thomas Edwards's 1828 sale, No. 869 (Sir Thomas Philips, £95.11.0). 37 Nichols, Illustrations , IV (1822), 882. Beloe, Sexegenarian , II, 279, says that his "speculations . . . elevated [Edwards] to considerable distinction and opulence". 38 The Diary of Joseph Farington , ed. K. Garlick and A. Macintyre, IV (1979), 1572. I am informed by Miss Constance-Anne Parker, Librarian of the Royal Academy, that there is no record at all of the 1802 Catalogue in the Minutes of the Royal Academy. The Royal Academy librarian of Edwards's time (1794-1812) was Edward Burch, R.A. 39 Beloe, Sexegenarian , II, 279. 40 When Evans took over James Edwards's business, he acquired numbers of his publications, which he offered in his Catalogue (1804), describing himself as "Successor to Mr. Edwards". Many of the Edwards publications were described as " new and very neat ", a formula probably indicating that they were remainders rather than second-hand copies. Among the more remarkable Edwards editions were Benaven, Le Caissier (1781) No. 380; Horace, Opera (1792), Large Paper, No. 520; Dutens, Table Genealogique (London, n.d.), new, No. 629; Eckel, Doctrina Numorum , No. 865-866; Cardonnel, Scotland , quarto, No. 958, and octavo, No. 1608; Pinkerton, Essay on Medals , No. 1888; Roscoe, Medici (1796, the First Edition, not the current one), No. 3671; works with coloured plates (Lysons, Wood-chester , No. 48, 240; Harrison, Colour , No. 306) and in elegant bindings (Smith, Views in Italy [1792], No. 29; Holbein, Triumph of Death , No. 64; Hamilton, Grammont , No. 76, 648-649). 41 Dibdin, Bibliographical Decameron III (1817), 113; the whole account is a long footnote on pp. 111-126. Edwards's pervasive responsibility for the sale is indicated by a MS note from him of 28 March 1815 (bound with one of the Hanson copies of the catalogue in Bodley) in which he offers credit to Messrs Arch &amp; Co for the sale to follow. 42 One of the vases owned by Edwards was represented in a large print in some copies of [James Christie], A Disquisition upon Etruscan Vases (1806). 43 Dibdin, Bibliographical Decameron , III (1817), 112. On the other hand, Alfred Wallis, Examples of the Book-Binders' Art of the XVI. and XVII. Centuries (1890), said of the bindings: "This may be considered to indicate the lowest pecuniary point in which historic and beautiful bindings sank in the present century, but they remained at a low-water mark, or thereabouts, for a long time afterwards" (Introduction, [v-vi]). The sale made some noise in the literary world, and three notes [?by Dibdin] about the Bibliotheca Edwardsiana appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine , LXXXV (Feb, March, April 1815), 135, 254-255, 349: "The magic hammer of Mr. Evans will in a few weeks be upraised amidst a throng of Bibliomaniacs " when the library of James Edwards, "( the hospitable Rinaldo of the 'Bibliomania')" will be sold "by the advice of . . . [his] Medical friends". Some highlights are quoted from the catalogue in March and some prices recorded in April, with the enigmatic statement: "The beautiful Vases were not sold". There was also "An Account of the Prices and Purchasers of the most valuable Articles in the Collection of the late James Edwards, Esq. sold by Mr. Evans, April 5, 1815, and Five following Days, at No. 26, Pall Mall" in the Classical Journal , XII (Sept 1815), 35-41. 44 Dibdin, Bibliographical Decameron , III (1817), 14-15, 15fn, and 17. A footnote to p. 14 says: "The Bibliomania was scarcely published when the aptitude of the character of Rinaldo to that of the late Mr. James Edwards was promptly and generally acknowledged." 45 According to Hanson MSS, p. 260, after the death of James Edwards's son James Justinian George Edwards (1811-84), there was a ten-day sale of his house-contents by Messrs Edwards of Newcastle-under-Lyme, beginning 23 Feb 1885, including some lots which came from his father, such as the ring with the head of Alexander Pope (No. 782), which the poet had given to Bishop Warburton and which James Edwards had inherited from Dr William Stephens. 46 See "The Bookseller as Diplomat: James Edwards, Lord Grenville, and Earl Spenser in 1800", Book Collector , XXXIII (1984), 471-485. 47 See "The 1821 Edwards Catalogue", Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly , XVII (1984), 154-156. 48 Quoted from a reproduction of the original in his collection generously sent me by my friend Dr Anthony Lister. On it is a memorandum in the hand of W. Ford: "This circular was drawn up by W. Ford Booksr. of Manchester who also made the Catalogue." According to Anthony Lister, "William Ford (1771-1832) "the Universal Bookseller", Book Collector , XXXVIII (1989), 27, this Edward sale was "Quite the most interesting instance of Ford's participation in a Manchester auction". Thomas Edwards also acted occasionally as the vendor of auction catalogues in whose contents he had no financial interest. For example, Mr Edwards, Halifax, was one of seventeen vendors in as many cities for Winstanley &amp; Taylor's catalogues of the Library of John Leigh Philips, Esq. deceased , 17-27 Oct 1814 (Harvard, Boston Public Library) and of his Paintings &amp; Drawings, Prints &amp; Etchings, Cabinet of Insects, &amp;c. , 31 Oct-11 Nov 1814 (Harvard)—but not of his Books . . . ( Omitted in the Former Sale ), 11 Nov 1814 (Harvard). 49 This catalogue contains an advertisement for the sale of Thomas Edwards's paintings, drawings, and engravings, but I do not know of a catalogue for it. 50 See "The Selling of Blake's Night Thoughts Designs in the 1870s", Blake: An Illustrated Blake , XII (1978), 70-71. 51 Untraced Catalogues: William Edwards (Nov 1749; Dec 1754; Oct 1755; Oct 1756; Oct 1757; Oct 1759; March 1760); James Edwards (1785; Santorio 1791; Wootton 1795); Thomas Edwards (April 1812; May 1812; 1828 prints). Traced Catalogues: James Edwards (1787; Pinelli 1789; 1789; gold 1790; Pinelli 1790; 1790; Paitoni 1790-91; Parisiana 1791; Parisina 1791; 1794; 1796; June 1799; April 1815; July 1820); Thomas Edwards (1815; Aug 1815; 1816; March-April 1818; 1821; 1-2 May 1826; 14-16 May 1826; May 1828; March 1835); Edwards-Heathcote (June 1928). I have derived much valuable information in tracing these catalogues from British Book Sale Catalogues 1676-1800 : A Union List Compiled and Edited by A. N. L. Munby and Lenore Coral (1977). 52 The information about William Edwards catalogues derives from Elizabeth Swaim's list of "Eighteenth-Century Auction and Fixed-Book Sales in Yorkshire" 1691-1781 in her "The Auction as a means of book distribution in eighteenth-century Yorkshire", Publishing History , I (1977), 75-91, supplemented from the Hanson MSS for those of 1749, 1759, and 1760. She remarks that the advertisements are often ambiguous as to who is holding the auction and that the only one she is sure is by William Edwards is that of 1757. She also lists W. Edwards as the vendor of the following auction catalogues of other men: 27 Jan 1755 at Bradford (advertisements in the Leeds Intelligencer , 7 Jan 1755; York Courant , 7 Jan 1755); 29 Jan 1757 at Bradford ( Leeds Intelligencer , 25 Jan 1757). No catalogue of William Edwards is known to survive. 53 The first two references are taken from Hanson MSS, pp. 18, 129; for the third, I am indebted to Professor Elizabeth Swaim. 54 "J. Mainwaring" is called "Peter Mainwaring" by the usually reliable Richard Gough (Nichols, Illustrations , IV [1822], 821). 55 A column of titles begins here; the two columns are separated by a vertical rule. 56 Arthur Rau, "Bibliotheca Parisina", Book Collector , XVIII (1969), 307-317, discusses in detail and reproduces the English cancel title-page found (along with the cancellandum) in the copy in the possession of Mr Anthony Hobson.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Notes on Cancellation in Scott's Life of Napoleon by B. J. McMullin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The idea of writing a biography of Napoleon was suggested to Sir Walter Scott in late May 1825 by his bookseller-partner Archibald Constable, who proposed that 'the Author of Waverley' produce such a work—to be in four volumes—for his projected 'Miscellany'. 1 A mere two years later (28 June 1827) appeared the nine volumes of The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte, Emperor of the French. With a preliminary view of the French Revolution. By the Author of "Waverley," &amp;c., , a publication long known to be peppered with cancels—indeed, Ruff has identified 125 of them. 2 . The cancels were occasioned for the most part by the need to correct matters of fact—dates, points of the compass, the names of protagonists, the geographical relationship of combatants, and so on—and, less often, of grammar (notably errors in agreement). Not all errors, however, were corrected by this process of extensive cancellation, for each volume has in addition an errata slip; and Ruff records that the second edition, also dated 1827, contains 28 further cancels. Scott erred in matters of fact essentially because of the circumstances in which Napoleon was written; it is the purpose of this essay (i) to recount those circumstances and then (ii) to add notes supplementary to Ruff's on the cancels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(i) The proposal that the biography be included in 'Constable's Miscellany' was apparently not long pursued, and the earliest subsequent references to it regard it as constituting a separate publication, to be issued in three volumes. Even before Scott had started writing, Ballantyne produced estimates for printing the work in four volumes post octavo and three volumes demy octavo, but a decision was made in favour of three volumes post octavo, a compression to be achieved by increasing the size of the type page. 3 By early September 1825 Scott had begun reading and making notes, 4 and by early October he had completed volume 1 except for revising and adding authorities ( Letters 9:231; to Ballantyne, 7 Oct. 1825). At this stage Scott believed that the work would run to five volumes, having decided that the first volume should be 'entirely preliminary a sketch of the Revolution'. 5 As writing progressed, Scott's estimate of the number of volumes that the work would occupy increased. By late April 1826, when he had completed volume 2, he believed that 'from the materials that pour in it cannot be comprised in less than six volumes' ( Letters 10:22; to Ballantyne, 26 April [1826]). By mid-September, when volume 5 was nearly complete, he had realised that 'the work must necessarily extend to seven volumes. I cannot squeeze it into six' ( Letters 10:105; to John Gibson, junior, 15 Sept. [1826]). In March 1827 he was referring to an eighth volume ( Letters 10:177; to Ballantyne, [21 March 1827]), in May to a ninth ( Letters 10:212; to Maria Edgeworth, 15 May 1827). Scott's changing estimates of the extent of the work were duly reflected in advertisements for it—Ruff cites those from The Edinburgh Weekly Journal : 11 January 1826, 5 volumes; 8 November 1826, 7 volumes; 11 April 1827, 8 volumes; and finally, 27 June 1827 (the day before publication), 9 volumes. Great though the task was of writing a biography of Napoleon, it did not occupy Scott's entire attention in the two years in which he was at work on it. In November 1825 he began Woodstock ( Letters 9:217; to Ballantyne, [6 Nov. 1825]), published 28 April 1826, and by June 1826 he had started on Chronicles of the Canongate ( Letters 10:52; to Ballantyne, 8 June 1826), published October 1827. In addition he oversaw the preparation of the six-volume Miscellaneous Prose Works , published October 1827, and apparently did further work on the subsequently abandoned edition of Shakespeare. Scott's capacity for churning out page after page seemingly at will is renowned. At one stage while working on Napoleon he even described himself as 'a perfect Automaton. Bonaparte runs in my head from 7 in the morning till ten at night without intermission'. 6 As long as he remained in good health Scott seems to have found writing not only easy but also pleasurable. But an added goad to maintaining a feverish pace was provided by the financial disaster of January 1826—when Constable, the printer James Ballantyne and Scott himself were all ruined by the failure of Hurst Robinson (the London booksellers)—for Scott's response to the financial mess was to attempt to recoup the losses by the exercise of his pen. Henceforth the writing of Napoleon is frequently associated with financial recovery: 'I have little to add excepting that I am instantly turning my thoughts to Napoleon. Labour of that kind is to me as it always has been pleasure and if I can extricate my unpleasant affairs by it surely it will not be wanting' ( Letters 9:487; to Ballantyne, 26 March 1826). (In fact Scott received from Longman for Napoleon 10,500 guineas—i.e. £11,025 [ Letters 10:113; to John Gibson, (8 Oct. 1826)].) Despite the general pleasurability of the task, towards the end Scott had come to resent the time devoted to Napoleon . Writing to Morritt, he lamented that 'Napoleon has been such an absolute millstone about my neck not permitting me for many a long day to think my own thoughts to work my own work an[d] a fortiori to write my own letters' ( Letters 10:226; to John B. S. Morritt, 16 June 1827). In the same letter he expressed himself unconcerned about the work's reception: 'I am now finishd . . . and as usual not very anxious about the opinion of the public as I have never been able to see that much anxiety has any effect in mollyfying the minds of the readers while it renders that of the author very uncomfortable'. And yet earlier he had described it as 'the only work of mine the popularity of which I somehow anticipate with confidence' ( Letters 10:22; to Ballantyne, 26 April [1826]). Napoleon , a work of history rather than purely of imagination, was a 'Brickwork' which could not be 'carried on without straw' ( Letters 9:193; to Ballantyne, 27 July 1825). On the one hand Scott had to travel to inspect official records and to tap the memories of those with first-hand knowledge—hence his trip to London and Paris in October-November 1826. In London his objective was to see the correspondence in the Foreign Office relating to Napoleon's final years on St. Helena ( Journal 177, 27 July 1826, and 217, 19 Oct. 1826). Of his visit to Paris he reported to Ballantyne: 'I cannot say I have gaind much new information by my researches but I have cleard up many doubts and got much light on Bonapartes character of which I think I have got a very clear view by dint of conversing with friends and foes. So I have no reason to regret my coming here [London] or my trip to Paris' ( Letters 10:124; to Ballantyne, 11 Nov. 1826). On the other hand appropriate source materials had to be assembled at Abbotsford. At the outset Constable undertook to supply volumes that Scott needed, including seventy-seven volumes of Le Moniteur universel (the official French government journal, 1789-1869), extending from June 1789 to December 1823; these he obtained in September 1825 from Paris ( Archibald Constable 3:314). From time to time Scott expressed a need for specific volumes. In September 1825 it was for 'the Memoires of Segur . . . who was Master of Ceremonies to Buonaparte' ( Letters 9:220; to Constable, [9 Sept. 1825]) and 'Made. de Genlis Memoirs— also Made. de Staels personal memoris—in the original, translations are such butcherly work' ( Letters 9:224; to Constable, 22 Sept. 1825). In September 1826 it was for Southey's History of the Peninsular War ( Letters 10:105; to John Gibson, junior, 15 Sept. [1826]), a work the first two volumes of which he had received by 5 October ( Letters 10:110; to John Gibson, [5 Oct. 1826]) and which he read during the visit to London ( Journal 217, 19 Oct. 1826). Occasionally writing was actually held up for want of a particular volume— in September 1826 'Denon's Egypt' ( Letters 10:72; to Ballantyne, [8 July 1826]). Other problems beset Scott too—for example: 'I have got Nap: d---n him into Italy where with bad eyes and obscure maps I have a little difficulty in tracing out his victorious chess-play' ( Journal 135-136, 25 April 1826). And when Lady Scott died, 14 May 1826, Scott sought solace in writing. In the period 1-11 June he wrote the final 52 sheets of volume 3 (the equivalent of about 200 pages of print [ Journal 137, 26 April 1826]). He admitted to his journal that it was 'an awful screed' and fully expected there to be inaccuracies in it ( Journal 157, 12 June 1826). The topic of inaccuracies is a recurrent one. After Ballantyne had dined with him in March 1827 Scott noted: 'There must be sad inaccuracies, some which might certainly have been prevented by care, but as the Lazaroni used to say—"Did you but know how Lazy I am"' ( Journal 287, 11 March 1827). Many of Scott's difficulties with Napoleon were in the event transferred to Ballantyne for resolution. When Ballantyne expressed pleasure with the manuscript of volume 1 Scott enjoined: 'Pray be careful in noticing repetitions of expression of which I am but too guilty' ( Letters 9:277; to Ballantyne, [6 Nov. 1825]). Once printing started, Ballantyne became all too aware of the difficulties that the text presented: 'By the by, I have been reading over, critically, what has been printed; and I find the tautologies and inaccuracies very numerous indeed. Yet every one sheet costs me 5 hours labour, if it costs me five minutes' (quoted in Letters 9:493, fn. 1). Scott's reply seems to convey both the speed with which he was working and perhaps a casual attitude to the resultant text: 'As for inaccuracies I really correct as attentively as my eyes will permit though as for spending five hours on a proof Sheet why I never spend two in writing the copy' ( Letters 9:493; to Ballantyne, 28 March [1826]). In the end Scott appears to have anticipated publication with a certain resignation: 'I wish it may answer your expectations. It will disappoint unreasonable people on both sides and what I care much more about it will be found I fear in some particulars less accurate than I could wish. At the same time I think the errors will be chiefly verbal or literal. My eyes do not serve me so well to correct proofs as they did formerly' ( Letters 10:159; to J. G. Lockhart, 15 Feb. [1827]). Essentially, then, Scott erred—in matters of fact especially—because of the speed at which he was writing and the handicap of working at a distance from some of his primary sources. These difficulties were compounded by the effects of personal calamities experienced during the writing and what might be described as an ambivalent or changeable attitude towards the task in hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(ii) William Ruff has already documented the extent of the cancels in Napoleon and discovered the reasons for implementing most of them. The major source of Ruff's information was a collection of 'leaves-to-be-cancelled' in the British Library (610.g.14) accompanied by a printed notice reading: 'The Publishers of the LIFE OF NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE, by the author of "Waverley", beg, in an especial manner, to direct your attention to the Cancels , about which the Binders have printed instructions in the book. 41, St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, 30th June 1827.' (Needless to say, a copy of the printed instructions would be an invaluable piece of evidence in reconstructing the early bibliographical history of Scott's Napoleon .) According to Ruff, 'This volume contains 131 leaves plus a few duplications; all but eight of the leaves have corrections in ink. The handwriting may be Robert Cadell's; it is not Scott's.' I take it that Ruff means that 123 [ vere 124?—one cancellandum is not included in the collection] of the leaves are cancellanda with manuscript emendments to make them conform with the corresponding cancellantia and that the other eight are not emended and agree with the corresponding leaves in the volumes as published. Yet he goes on to say: 'If I could not find the cause of a cancel by looking in this volume, I have gone to the first American edition of the Life . In every case it shows the text before any passages were cancelled. . . . This American edition . . . was undoubtedly printed from proof sheets, not from the completed and bound volumes'. This use of the American edition would have been particularly ingenious in the absence of the British Library volume of cancellantia; it is not obvious, however, what it contributes to the enquiry that is not already clear from the other volume, and Ruff does not in fact claim that his looking was fruitful. In the following notes I have not sought to repeat Ruff's investigation but, by examining two sets of the British edition in the Poynton Collection in the Baillieu Library, University of Melbourne, have attempted to shed some light on the printing-house management of the process of cancellation. The two sets are distinguishable by their binding: 'copy 1' is uncut in original boards; 'copy 2' is cut, in contemporary half calf, lacking all half-titles. (1) Stop-press correction . Ruff records in the British Library collection of cancellanda six (not eight) aberrant leaves—i.e. leaves which agree with the corresponding leaves in all copies of the British and American editions with which he compared them. The explanation for the presence of these six leaves is that not all corrections were made after the printing of the sheet (or forme) containing them had been completed: some were effected in the course of the run by stopping the press, cancellantia being subsequently printed from the same setting of type for insertion only in those copies of the sheet containing the variant forme which had been worked off prior to the correction being made at press. The agreement of the American edition with the British in these six instances is to be explained simply by the American being set at these points from an exemplar of the British proof sheet which had already been corrected at press. The two Poynton sets do not constitute a very large sample, but they do reveal a handful of examples of a correction being made at press in one copy and via cancellation in the other. The relative extent of stop-press correction is presumably suggested by the British Library collection of cancellanda, though since the collection is not absolutely complete and since there is a possibility that those corrections known hitherto only in the form of cancellantia may also exist made at press one might expect an examination of other sets to reveal further examples where the corrected reading is found variously on (a) an integral leaf (i.e. as a stop-press correction) or (b) a cancellans leaf. Ninety per cent of the cancellans leaves contain a correction in only one of their two pages. One would therefore suppose that approximately half the corrections were made in a page forming part of the white-paper forme of the original impression, the other half in a page forming part of the reteration forme. A larger sample might therefore be expected to reveal—in instances where a correction was made first at press and then via a cancellans—two varieties of cancellantia: (b) (i) with both pages of the cancellans in the same setting as in (a), the correction having been made in the whitepaper forme; (b) (ii) with the page not containing the correction in a different setting from that in (a), the correction having been made in the reteration forme, thus requiring the page from the white-paper forme to be reset. (2) Printing the cancellantia . Given the existence of form (a) of at least some leaves, the printing of the cancellantia cannot have been a straightforward business, in that in such instances the numbers required must have varied according to the stage within the impression at which the stop-press correction had been made. There is also the possibility that cancellantia the need for which was recognized early enough could have been imposed for printing along with the preliminaries, though of course the preliminaries could equally well have been produced in various ways independently of the cancellantia. Despite these unknowns, a number of demonstrable observations can be made about the printing of the cancellantia: (a) Sheet numbers . Whatever the precise purpose of the British Library collection of cancellanda, and in the absence of the instructions to the printer, it can nonetheless be confidently asserted that up to 120 of the cancellantia were printed together (or in conjunction with part sheets constituting preliminary or final gatherings) as fifteen sheets. This assertion rests on the fact that in printing them Ballantyne used a device first employed by him in 1823 in a rather different context but for essentially the same purpose. Beginning with the twelve-volume Novels and tales of the Author of Waverley , and consistently thereafter when printing eighteenmos, Ballantyne inserted in the direction line of the first recto of the first gathering contained in the sheet what I have chosen to call a 'sheet number'—an arabic number from the sequence 1, 2, 3, etc. Since Ballantyne's eighteenmos were imposed for gathering sometimes in sixes, sometimes in alternating twelves and sixes (i.e. respectively three and two gatherings to a sheet) sheet numbers were inserted in order to provide the warehouseman and binder with confirmation that they had a complete set of sheets, a function which the signatures less clearly performed. In Napoleon the same device was used to indicate that the set of sheets comprising the cancellantia was complete; in this instance, of course, signatures were of no use whatsoever. From the bound volumes it cannot on the whole be determined which cancellantia were imposed with which, but the following is a record of the cancellantia on which the sheet numbers appear: 1 ---- 2 vol. 2, E1 3 vol. 2, K7 4 vol. 3, A4 5 vol. 4, R8 6 vol. 4, E2 7 vol. 5, A2 8 vol. 5, I5 9 vol. 5, T8 10 vol. 6, C7 11 vol. 6, A2 12 vol. 7, H3 13 vol. 7, C1 14 vol. 8, A4 15 vol. 7, A2 (Note that the first sheet is not numbered; this is usually the case also in eighteenmos, where the content of the first sheet presumably constituted sufficient guide.) The disposition of the sheet numbers indicates that the cancellantia were not imposed seriatim, even though the general progression follows the sequence of the volumes. That the cancellantia were imposed with preliminary and final part-sheets is suggested by the press figures, for among them the cancellantia can muster only 23 press figures, whereas, in this almost-fully-figured publication, 30 might have been expected from the 15 numbered sheets. All that one can conclude is that the process of producing the cancellantia was complex. (b) Conjugacy of cancellantia . Occasionally two consecutive leaves were required to be replaced, and in at least some instances the two cancellantia were imposed in such a way that they shared an inner margin. Binders could therefore either reduce all the sheets of cancellantia to individual leaves or take advantage of the conjugacy of pairs of cancellantia to replace disjunct cancellanda by conjugate pairs of cancellantia, to be inserted by tipping in or sewing. That binders did not all (or did not consistently) choose one or the other method of dealing with consecutive cancellantia is shown by the Poynton copies: sometimes one method was used, sometimes the other—thus in vol. 7 cancellantia H3 and H4 and 2A5 and 2A6 are conjugate in copy 1, disjunct in copy 2. Instances of consecutive cancellantia comprising the last leaf of one gathering and the first of the next even exist—thus in both copies of vol. 6 the cancellantia R8 and S1 are conjugate. (c) Duplicate settings . In the Poynton copies three cancellantia exist each in two settings: * 1 in vol. 1, R6 in vol. 8 and Y1 in vol. 9. The possible explanations for the duplicate settings are no doubt many, including the repairing of accident and initial setting in duplicate for convenience in machining. However, in the instance in vol. 1 one of the settings is from a fount different from that employed for setting the surrounding text, so that the simplest explanation for the existence of this duplicate setting is that the run of the fifteen sheets (assuming that the earlier setting formed part of one of them) did not contain enough copies of this cancellans and therefore that extra copies had to be produced, probably not by Ballantyne and possibly in London at Longman's bidding. In the other two instances—where the duplicate setting may well be 'original'—one might assume that the need for cancellation was recognized only after the fifteen sheets of cancellantia had been printed off, or alternatively that the cancellation was made so early in the run that the cancellans was set in duplicate as part of the fifteen sheets in order to produce the required number. One might also assume that those sheets common to the first and second editions are more likely to contain cancellantia in variant settings in the second edition, those two thousand sets of sheets being identifiably the last 25% of the print run to be bound up and issued. There is the likelihood, too, that a comparison of other sets would reveal further examples of duplicate settings of cancellantia. Again, though the phenomenon is observable the explanation for it may not be at all obvious. (That the vast bulk of the cancellantia—on the evidence of the Poynton sets—do not exist in duplicate settings may be taken to suggest that the corrections that they embody were effected, for the most part, after the printing of the particular sheets was complete.) (3) The second edition . As Ruff reports, the second edition of Napoleon comprises vol. 3 from gathering F onwards and vols. 4-9 in their entirety in new settings, vols. 1 and 2 and the beginning of vol. 3 being made up of sheets of the first edition. The presence of re-issued sheets is accounted for by the decision to reduce the first edition total from 8000 to 6000, a decision made, in April 1826, when printing had already started on vol. 3 ( Journal 318, 21 June 1827). The two additional cancellantia reported by Ruff in the re-issued sheets of vol. 1 (T3 and X4) presumably resulted from Scott's reaction to the appearance of the first edition: one day after publication he noted in his journal: 'Detected two gross blunders though which I had ordered for cancel' ( Journal 319, 29 June 1827). However, since the decision to cancel was taken so soon after publication it is possible that the two cancellantia appear in the small number of copies of the first edition not yet distributed. (4) Notes on individual volumes . In the following notes attention is drawn to points in which one or both of the Poynton copies differ from Ruff's record or are otherwise noteworthy (all references to leaves are to cancellantia unless otherwise stated; any cancellans not explicitly mentioned is found in the same setting, disjunct, in both copies). Vol. 1 * 1 exists in two settings. In copy 1 the leaf is not signed and is set from the same fount as the rest of the Advertisement; the first line ends 'Work, have,'. In copy 2 the leaf is signed '*' and is set from a different fount from the rest of the Advertisement; the first line ends 'Work,' (thereafter the two settings are out of step for the whole of the first paragraph). Given that the copy 2 setting is from a different fount it is probably the later, and the 'signature' * is probably no more than one of the conventional methods of denoting a cancellans. If such is the case, the volume should properly collate i 2 2 i 4 (-2 i 4) . . . , not i 2 * 1 2 i 2 . . . . 'VOL. I.' in direction line, A8 r . Press figures: T6 v -15, Y5 r -18. Vol. 2. F5 and F6 are conjugate in copy 1, disjunct in copy 2. There is an additional cancellans, Z1, in copy 2; it is in the same setting as Z1 in copy 1 (where Z1 and Z8 are conjugate). In copy 1 cancellandum K3 is intact; the slash made to mark it for replacement has been carefully repaired. Q7 (one of Ruff's aberrant leaves) is a cancellans in copy 2; it agrees in setting with Q7 in copy 1, where it is conjugate with Q2. The other aberrant leaf, b1, is in the same setting in both copies (it is a singleton, and the verso is blank). 'VOL. II.' in direction line, E1 r , K3 r (copy 2), K7 r , R3 r , S4 r , Z2 r , 2A5 r , 2B6 r . Press figures: F6 r -20, O5 v -10, S4 v -6, Z2 v -1. Vol. 3. In copy 1, i 2 (title leaf) is conjugate with i 1 ( i 1 lacking in copy 2). B2 in copy 1, though the cancellans, has been salshed (presumably in error) and the slash carefully repaired. In both copies K5 is not a cancellans, but contains the corrected reading. M6 and M7 are conjugate in copy 1, disjunct in copy 2. Y3 and Y4 are conjugate in both copies. T2 (one of Ruff's aberrant leaves) is conjugate with T7 in both copies. Copy 1 contains a 6-line errata slip. Sheet number, 4, missing from A4 in copy 1, though the leaf is in the same setting as A4 in copy 2. 'VOL. III.' in direction line, A4 r , L2 r , M6 r , M7 r , R5 r (leaf lacking in copy 1), X8 r . Press figures: G4 v -2, L2 v -9. Vol. 4. 'VOL. IV.' in direction line, E2 r (leaf lacking in copy 1), R8 r . Press figures: P3 v -9, R1 v -3, R8 v -16, S6 v -2. Vol. 5. P8 and Q1 are conjugate in copy 1, disjunct in copy 2. X2 (one of Ruff's aberrant leaves) is in the same setting in both copies; though X7 is a cancellans in both copies, X2 almost certainly formed part of the original sheet. 'VOL. V.' in direction line, A2 r , I5 r , T8 r . Press figures: F3 v -8, N7 v -14, Q1 v -2, S3 v -10, 2C7 v -4. Vol. 6 . A2 and A3 and R8 and S1 are conjugate in both copies. In copy 1 Y8 is in fact the cancellans for volume 5, Y8 (where the cancellation has also been made). 'VOL. VI.' in direction line, A2 r , C7 r . Press figures: M6 v -5, Q7 v -6, U4 r -13 in copy 1, 14 in copy 2 (U4 in same setting in both copies). Vol. 7 . H3 and H4 and 2A5 and 2A6 are conjugate in copy 1, disjunct in copy 2. A4, C3 and E3 (among Ruff's aberrant leaves) are in the same setting in both copies; all form an integral part of their sheet. Copy 1 contains a 3-line errata slip. In copy 2 B7 is attached to a stub, but the inner margin is narrower than usual, suggesting perhaps that the leaf was excised in error and then reinserted (it is in the same setting as B7 in copy 1, and B7 is not included in the British Library collection of cancellanda). 'VOL. VII.' in direction line, A2 r , B8 r , C1 r , H3 r . Press figures: 2A7 r -14, 2A7 v -12, 2G3 v -7. Vol. 8 . R6 is set in duplicate. 'VOL. VIII.' in direction line, A4 r ('VOL. VII.' in copy 2), L1 r , R6 r (both settings). Press figure: R6 r (copy 2)-10. Vol. 9 . Y1 exists in two settings, distinguishable by lines 13 and 14 of Y1 v ending respectively 'have' and 'to' in copy 1 and 'steps' and 'life,' in copy 2. The evidence afforded by the Poynton sets of Scott's Napoleon may have helped shed some light on the process of cancellation in that publication, but it does not allow a resolution of all the problems associated with that process. Clearly further sets need to be examined before the printing history of the work can be reconstructed with some certainty.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Surviving Galley Proofs of Lawrence's Sons and Lovers by Helen V. Baron</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When D. H Lawrence's final manuscript of Sons and Lovers is compared with Duckworth's first edition there are found to be thousands of variants. They are hard to quantify because substantive revisions can be one word or several sentences, but when they are listed according to the points in the text at which they occur, the list has approximately seven thousand entries, of which approximately four and a half thousand are punctuation. Discovering who was responsible for each item is not now possible but some bearings can be taken from the small number of revised galley proofs which has come to light. 1 An unmarked set of page proofs has been in the possession of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at Austin for many years, but James Boulton's more recent location of the galley proofs is both the rewarding by-product of scholarly endeavor and an invaluable discovery for editors and others who ponder the many changes that took place between Lawrence's submission of his manuscript to Duckworth in November 1912 and publication of the first edition in May 1913. For although the galleys that have survived are unfortunately incomplete, amounting to only about a ninth of the novel, they belonged to the set corrected by Lawrence. The galley proofs are of interest in the pure bibliographical sense of providing evidence about a sample of printing practice. They also help to make sense of the compositors' marks on the Sons and Lovers manuscript, which number more than eighty and may well puzzle the many scholars who are currently consulting the photographic facsimile of the manuscript published in 1977. 2 Most importantly, they provide the only firm evidence of how accurate the compositors were; what changes and suggestions were entered on the proofs before they were sent to Lawrence; how well Lawrence corrected substantive errors; how he responded to the massive quantity of punctuation changes; and how much and in what way he revised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Selective Chronology On 1 July 1912, while William Heinemann was writing to Lawrence to announce his rejection of 'Paul Morel', Walter de la Mare, Heinemann's Reader, was writing to Edward Garnett, Reader for Duckworth, to inform him of the firm's decision. As a result of these exchanges between publishers in London, Lawrence, in Gargnano beside lake Garda in Italy, received Heinemann's rejection of his novel one day and Garnett's offer to take an interest in it for Duckworth the next. To state, as Mark Sexton does, that: "Undaunted, Lawrence arranged for Edward Garnett . . . to read the work" (see note 1) not only misrepresents the chronology of incident as revealed by Lawrence's letters, but (more significantly, from my editorial point of view) implies that Lawrence was more in control of events than was evidently the case. 3 Garnett had in the same way secured publication by Duckworth for Lawrence's previous novel, The Trespasser , when Heinemann, to whom it was contracted, was unenthusiastic. Garnett had sent Lawrence detailed notes on the manuscript of The Trespasser which stimulated Lawrence to tackle it again and produce a final version; and he now did the same with the rejected Sons and Lovers manuscript. The same Guildford printers, Billing and Sons, who had set The Trespasser set the new novel, in both instances using Lawrence's manuscript as copy. In the case of The Trespasser only page proofs were produced, an unmarked set of which has survived. There the parallels appear to end, but it would be interesting to read a parallel study of the manuscript and proofs of The Trespasser , to see for example whether the compositors were the same men and how their house-styling compared with that in Sons and Lovers . As is well known, Lawrence triumphantly sent off his final manuscript of Sons and Lovers on 19 November 1912 but Garnett could not accept that it was so much longer than The Trespasser and wrote him a withering letter, before settling down to reduce it by a tenth. He then sent it directly to the printers. It was an ultimatum, and Lawrence had no option but to acquiesce. 4 Having been asked to check only one proof for each of his earlier novels, Lawrence assumed that the proofs of Sons and Lovers which began arriving in batches on 5 February 1913 were all he would have to correct. He does not mention whether the relevant pages of his manuscript were returned to him with each batch of proofs, although this was the usual practice. However, the proofs themselves were unusual. They were in the style of the French placard proofs of the period: four columns printed side-by-side on large sheets of paper. The columns were numbered (but not the sheets) and each contained eighty-eight lines of type, which was double page-length. Lawrence had corrected them by 3 March 1913 and expected his novel to be on sale in three weeks ( Letters 1: 524). He knew that Duckworth's terms included a downpayment of one hundred pounds on the day of publication and awaited the day with intense eagerness not only because he believed the book would make an impact but because his financial anxieties were acute. He had earned very little since resigning from his teaching job and he now had Frieda to support as well as himself—and indeed expected to be fined as a result of the imminent divorce proceedings. So he was aghast when he learned that Duckworth, who evidently wanted the novel to be censored further, had decided on another round of proofs, and he wrote back in desperation: "I don't mind if Duckworth crosses out a hundred shady pages in Sons and Lovers . It's got to sell, I've got to live" ( Letters 1: 526). The page proofs were in signatures of sixteen pages with forty-four lines of type to a page. They appear to have begun reaching Lawrence on 22 March 1913 and he seems to have finished correcting them by 11 April. This time the revised galley proofs were sent back to Lawrence with the batches of page proofs. His revisions had caused some realignment of text and therefore the galleys had been trimmed so that the text began and ended at the same point as each signature of page proofs. As Lawrence finished working on each batch he posted the page proofs to Duckworth and the corresponding galley proofs to Ernest Collings, an illustrator. In his letter to Collings he referred to them, perhaps confusingly for modern readers, as 'the first batch' ( Letters 1: 529). However, it is certain that what Collings received was a complete set of corrected galleys, for it was in his son Guy's possession that the few surviving galleys came to light when James Boulton wrote to enquire whether any of Lawrence's letters to Collings were still in existence. 5 At this time, March 1913, Lawrence and Collings had not met, but they had been exchanging letters since November 1912, when Collings sent Lawrence a book of his illustrations in appreciation of Lawrence's first two novels. Lawrence's reason for sending Sons and Lovers proofs to Collings was that Garnett had asked Lawrence to produce some drawings of collieries for the novel's dust-cover, but Lawrence felt unable and decided to pass the request on to Collings. The proofs were a gift, chiefly to give Collings some idea of what the novel was about and also as a kind of return favour. Only six of the original fifty-two sheets of galley proof survive and they are in fact three whole and three part galleys, containing eighteen whole and three part slips. They are in two separate sections and have been cut to tally with page-proof signatures: 23 (pages 359-368) and 26-27 (pages 401-423, i.e. to the end of the novel). The clicker's marks in the manuscript indicate that the first section was set by Moore and the second by Knowles and L. Bristow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Clicker's Marks in the Manuscript As Lawrence had sent it to Edward Garnett, the finished manuscript was 533 pages long but numbered 1-540. Garnett had then pruned the text, largely by deleting passages but also by scissors-and-pasting a little, so that it was 530 pages long when it reached the printers and still numbered 1-540. Evidence that Garnett had calculated the length of the manuscript, to determine format and page-length, in preparation for printing, is found in two sets of 100-word enumeration marks by him in the manuscript. Lawrence had written on one side of the paper only, but most of the novel, that is the 436 pages he wrote out at the last revision stage onto continental paper, 6 consisted of gatherings usually of about five but sometimes as many as ten sheets folded over together. These were now torn along the folds so that the manuscript stood in a pile of single leaves which could be handed round to the compositors. The annotations they then made on the manuscript show that it was set by a team ("companionship", or "ship") of nine compositors, working "upon lines", a method or organisation described by Philip Gaskell as "by the later nineteenth century . . . the normal arrangement in English houses for all classes of work." The team-leader or clicker "received the copy, passed on the overseer's instructions about letter for distribution and typographical style, and handed out takings of manuscript." 7 The publishers had normally "calculated the length of the whole manuscript, and it was no longer customary to cast it off [measure it in terms of format and page-lengths] in the composing room. . . . The clickers . . . divided the batches of copy into individual takings for the members of the ship, the length of the taking varying but being typically from one to four leaves of a manuscript written on one side of a 'quarto' paper. . . . The pattern of composition of a companionship job, as revealed by surviving copy marked up both by the individual compositors and by the clickers, was complex, not surprisingly since the six or eight members of a ship worked simultaneously on takes of different length, and probably had three or four different books on hand at a time" (Gaskell, p. 293). There are in fact two sets of clicker's marks 8 in the Sons and Lovers manuscript: entries in pencil recording the casting off of copy into estimated, numbered galley-lengths, and the distribution of these to the compositors; and entries mainly in ink, overlapping with the former, which indicate the actual galley proofs pulled. The relationship between these two sets of marks is instructive, but frequently baffling; and the pages below are an attempt to understand them and to gain a clearer picture of the working routine by which the novel was printed. Because Billing and Sons were not working towards page proofs, which Gaskell indicates were the norm at least until the 1880s (p. 293), but galley proofs consisting of four columns of eighty-eight lines of type, the manuscript appears to have been cast off in passages estimated at the equivalent of 352 lines of type. The notation entered in the manuscript, referring to each proof as a "galley" and each eighty-eight-line column as a "slip", ran counter to the normal use of the terminology at the time, which referred to the long trays of type as galleys and the proofs printed from them as slips. This suggests that this style of proofing was sufficiently recent for the terminology not yet to have settled down. 9 The clicker's annotations to the manuscript, marking the start of "galley one", "galley two" etc. (although the printed galleys were not numbered) occur on average every ten pages. Not only is this longer than the usual takings gauged in terms of page-lengths, but in practice the takings of this manuscript often consisted of more than one such cast-off galley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Rate of Work The surviving galley proofs were annotated with the date 21 February 1913 as they were checked and despatched to the author; and since they all belong to the latter part of the novel, this provides a clue as to how long the manuscript was in the printing shop. For the clicker entered another date, "27.1.", i.e. Monday 27 January 1913, in the manuscript in three places, pages 196, 205 and 324. As this note first occurs in the body of a 23-page taking set by one compositor, it does not in context appear to mark the start of setting the book, but a fresh large-scale distribution of copy at the beginning of a new week. If so, the first 195 manuscript pages had been started if not completed the week before. Thus, the period from sometime before Monday 27 January to Friday 21 February being four to five working weeks, it is possible that the compositors set the novel in three or four weeks and the last batch of proofs was checked and despatched within another week. The book when printed was in the region of just under a million (c. 975,000) "ens" in length. The average rate of work for an English compositor at the time has been calculated at about a thousand ens per hour including the distribution of type back into the cases, but this type was left standing and so the setting-rate would probably average more like 1,500 ens per hour at a minimum. The job therefore represented about 650 hours' work, and as the week was normally 50 or 55 hours, a companionship of five or six compositors could have set the novel in only two weeks. 10 Thus the nine compositors named in the manuscript cannot have been working solely on this book. Since the total work of 975,000 ens was printed in 52 galley proofs, each proof was about 18,750 ens long. At an average rate of 1,500 ens per hour a compositor may have set enough matter for a galley proof in about twelve and a half hours, or one and a quarter working days, and so in a 55-hour week could have set four and a half galley proofs. This consideration may have influenced the clicker in his distribution of the manuscript in takings to the compositors, for he gave them anything from one to six cast-off galleys at a time, so that the takings vary between ten and sixty manuscript pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Casting Off Edward Garnett had prepared the manuscript for publication and calculated its length. The task of casting-off enough text to fill the galley-trays was complicated by the fact that the amount of text on each MS page ranged from sixty to nine hundred words because of variation in paper-size, changes in Lawrence's handwriting (in the amount of interlinear revision and in the degree to which he crammed lines together on unlined paper), and deletions of irregular lengths of text by Garnett. The clicker's entries in pencil are typically as follows. The cast-off galleys were marked for example "Gal 27" or just with a number. The numbers ran roughly from one to fifty-two and some have a compositor's name pencilled beside them. It seems that when the clicker gave a compositor a taking of one or more cast-off galleys he wrote the man's name beside the first number; but it is not uncommon to find the same name beside more than one of the cast-off galleys in a long taking. The marks in ink are fuller, and they were evidently entered as the lines that had been set were imposed in galley proofs. But in fact they indicate only where every alternate proof began. A typical entry marks with a large square bracket the precise point in the text where the first slip of a new proof begins, even mid-word in some cases, and records the galley number, the slip number, the compositor's name, and the chapter number. The code for denoting the chapter number referred back to the last chapter-heading which had been set, as "l.c." or, once, "Last chapter", plus a roman numeral. For example on MS p. 489 (in chapter XIII) such an entry reads: " Moore Gal 45 Slip 177 Lc XIII ", and there is a large square bracket in the eleventh line of the page around the first word of "too flagrantly give herself away before the other girls" which coincides precisely with the start of slip 177 on the only one of the surviving galley proofs that is recorded in the manuscript. The few others are not so recorded because of the clicker's system of marking only alternate proofs, and because even within this sequence he omitted to note proofs at the very end (and indeed the beginning) of the novel. Thus fifty-two galleys were cast off in pencil and fifty-two appear to have been pulled, but the two sets of numbers in pencil and ink fluctuate in relation to each other as they progress through the manuscript. Evidently the clicker hoped that the length of text he estimated when entering his pencil marks would turn out to fit the 352 lines of type wanted for each galley proof, but in fact his cast-off galleys varied a great deal and, when set, ranged between approximately one hundred and five hundred lines of type. Twenty-one of the fifty-two cast-off galleys started with a new page in the manuscript, and all except two began with a new paragraph. The two exceptions, cast-off galleys 4 and 20, started mid-sentence with a square bracket marked in the text, and this suggests that here casting off was made in terms of a point already reached in the setting. On the other hand, the clicker's pencil can also be seen at work making improvised adjustments within a sequence already cast off. He pencilled-in a galley-number 39 towards the end of "galley" 38 as originally cast off, evidently because he wanted the compositor of 38 (which would have been 470 type-lines long) to make a new start. He then had to change his original cast-off galley 39 a few pages later to 40, and the one after that is numbered not 41 but 40A. This suggests that here the later 39 at least, if not also the later 40, had been cast off in advance (though the 40A may have been a subdivision of a cast-off galley that proved too long—40 and 40A together totalled nearly 460 lines of type). Presumably the reason why the clicker did not extend the new short "galley 39" into the next, and tell the compositor to continue setting, was that he had already given the next to someone else; and the reason that he renumbered the next "40" instead of "39A" must be that he used that tactic only within a taking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Distribution of Takings The clicker did not distribute this manuscript equally among the compositors named in it. He must have had a number of considerations in mind. He had to give copy to the different compositors according to their rate of work and the need to keep the setting-rate in proportion with the rate of imposition and proofing; and he had to dovetail the setting and imposing of these proofs with those of the other books the compositors were working on. Whatever further principles governed his method of distribution, it was surely intentional that, apart from the distinct break between Parts I and II of the novel, the chapter divisions were never used as breaks between compositors, even though they were sometimes used to start a new cast-off galley within a taking. Although in the page-proofs and first edition a new chapter would start on a new page, in the galley-proofs there was only a gap of ten lines between chapters, and therefore it was probably convenient for one man to set the juncture. The clicker generally ensured that a new taking began with a new paragraph (not merely each new galley as noted above). The only exception occurred very near the beginning of the work and was probably untypical for that reason. In fact there are only twenty-three transitions between compositors, and in fourteen of them the compositor started his new taking with a new paragraph on the first line of a manuscript page, which must have minimised the extent to which compositors needed to pass copy to those setting adjacent text. The striking feature of the takings is not simply that they were rather large, but that some of them appear to have been set by compositors working in pairs, simultaneously setting alternate stints. The names of the nine compositors, Cook, Rendell, L. Bristow, Notley, Moore, Deacon, Wright, Knowles and F. Bristow, seem to occur, recur and disappear in random succession in the manuscript, but when it is surveyed as a whole, the names group together to indicate only ten fundamental divisions of the text among them. The general pattern is not immediately evident because the marks are scant at the beginning of the work. Cook's name is the first to appear, on p. 29, and thereafter it occurs only once again, deleted. But page 29 was not necessarily the start of Cook's take (his name may have been written also on the edge of p. 8) and unless a specimen was first set and submitted to the publishers, it seems likely that Cook set the first 41 pages and then worked on something else. The next compositor, Rendell, began his taking on the second line of p. 42 and it was marked unusually as beginning mid-sentence, with a square bracket in pencil around the first word of "an hour of joy", a phrase which certainly starts a new line in the page-proofs, on the first page of chapter II. This may therefore be the point at which the general distribution of Part I began. After the obscure start, the total distribution of takings fell into the following shape: Rendell and L. Bristow cast-off galleys 4-10, Notley 11-16, Moore 17-18, Deacon and Wright 19-30, Knowles 31-34, L. Bristow and Rendell (again) 35-39, F. Bristow and Moore 40-49, Knowles 50-51, and L. Bristow 52.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Compositors Working in Pairs In the four shared takings the compositors set one or more cast-off galleys in a series of stints. In the first, Rendell set 4-6, L. Bristow 7-9 and Rendell 10. But in their next taking they worked even more closely together. L. Bristow set 35, Rendell 36-37 and then L. Bristow set 38 (MS pp. 404-413), although one page of it, which started with a new paragraph on the first line and ended with a complete paragraph on the last, was set by Rendell (p. 407). Then in the middle of p. 413, L. Bristow continued setting an unusually short section of only three and a half small pages which the clicker numbered "39" in the apparently improvised manner described above. The fact that this forced him to renumber the next cast-off galley appears to reveal that he needed to make some minor adjustments in his casting off at this point, but since the cast-off galley he cut short was one that these two compositors shared and set in unusually rapid overlapping stints, it may reveal instead that here the rate of imposition had caught up with the rate of setting, or they were rounding off a week's work. Of the other two pairs of compositors who worked together, Deacon and Wright set in consistently longer stints: Deacon 19-23, Wright 24-25, Deacon 26-27, and Wright 28-30, tackling in this way nearly 120 pages of the manuscript, which was their total share of the book, amounting to about 3,770 lines of type or 10.7 galley proofs. It probably took them little more than a week. Similarly F. Bristow and Moore set a hundred pages in alternating stints, but their shares were unequal: F. Bristow 40-41, Moore 42, F. Bristow 43, 43A, 43B, Moore 44-46, 46A and F. Bristow 47-49. Moore had already set two cast-off galleys and in the final totals of lines he and F. Bristow were among the three who set the greatest number. The fact that he had not worked in conjunction with F. Bristow in his first taking suggests that the overlapping arrangements were ad hoc . This interpretation, that the compositors' alternating stints were large takings distributed to pairs working simultaneously, is supported by the way the date, "27.1", was pencilled in by the clicker. It first occurs on p. 196, on the fifteenth page of Moore's twenty-three-page solo taking: he must therefore have set the first fourteen pages the week before. His taking ended at the end of Part I on MS p. 204, and the date then occurs a second time on p. 205, the start of Part II and of the 119-page taking set simultaneously by Deacon and Wright. Immediately after their last stint it occurs again, on p. 324 where Knowles the next compositor began. Thus it seems that on Monday 27 January the clicker began distributing Part II of the novel, the first twelve cast-off galleys to Deacon and Wright, the next four to Knowles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Imposition Meanwhile the work of imposition continued concurrently, and the clicker made ink annotations in the manuscript as the lines were imposed. He recorded alternate galleys, plus slip numbers and (as explained above) chapter numbers and compositors' names. It is evident that these entries do not simply refer to the proofs that had been imposed but form a bridge between the casting-off and the imposition. They are, indeed, so cryptic that it is only possible to speculate on the answers to the questions that arise. How did the cast-off galleys he had estimated tally with the precise lengths of text imposed for each proof? Did the compositors set portions of text according to the pencil record or the ink record of their names in the manuscript? How did they hand on copy or spare lines between takings? As the compositors delivered the lines of type to the clicker, he probably made them up into the correct lengths for the galley-trays ready for imposition then headed and numbered each column or slip. But he entered in ink in the manuscript both slip and galley numbers. These ink entries contain irregularities which make the sequence hard to follow simply by turning the pages of the manuscript, so they are summarised in the next three paragraphs. Since there are four slips to a galley proof, the number of the first slip of each proof is one more than four times the previous proof-number, e.g. galley proof 3 should start with slip 9. The first entry, however, is "Slip 9 Gal 2", but the "2" may simply be an error for "3". The next entry records only the slip number, 17, and omits a galley number, presumably 5. Thereafter the entries in ink consistently note alternate galleys, such that galley 7 starts at slip 25 and so on, until galley 19, at which point some confusion occurs. On reaching galley 19, which started with slip 73, the clicker omitted the galley number from his entry. He next entered galley 22, instead of 21, as starting with slip 81; and then galley 24 also as starting with slip 81. This latter must have been a simple error for 89, and the net effect was the loss of galley number 21. Then from galley 26 nearly to the end of the book, all the even-numbered galleys are consistently recorded, but the slip number for the start of each is now lower than it should be by a difference of four, such that the first slip of galley 26 is numbered not 101 but 97, and so on. This was apparently rectified at galley 43 by the insertion of subdivisions 43A and 43B; for thereafter odd-numbered galleys are recorded and the slip numbers are as one would expect at four to a galley. What in fact happened at galleys 21 and 43 was that the casting off turned out, as the lines of type were imposed, to be significantly inaccurate. When the lines are counted 11 it is clear that too little copy had been cast off up to galley 21 and 22, and too much for galleys 38-43. Therefore the clicker first omitted the number 21 from his ink marks and then he rearranged cast-off galley 39 and subdivided 40 and 43 in his pencil marks, and finally as the matter was imposed he noted the new galley numbers in his ink marks. From this it becomes clear that the clicker's ink marks actually combine two separate records: the slip number refers to the proofs, while the galley number refers back to the cast-off galleys as pencilled and adjusted in the manuscript. Thus the ink entries form a link that enabled him to relate the manuscript copy to the first proofs. The original casting off was in places widely divergent from the imposition, but once these adjustments had been made, it is generally the case that (apart from the opening six galleys which are untypical) the ink entries occur on average five MS pages after the pencil entries referring to the same galley number, though in one place the gap is only four lines. To take an illustrative example: the pencil entry on p. 75 (Lawrence's numbering), "7 L. Bristow", marks the start of L. Bristow's first stint in the large taking of cast-off galleys 4-10 set by him and Rendell. The next entry by the clicker, p. 79 (Lawrence's numbering), is in ink and records: "L. Bris. Gal 7 Slip 25 lc III" with a large square bracket in the text before: "'Well our mother!' he answered." Two observations can be made about this pair of entries. First, the pencil entry had occurred at a new paragraph five lines from the top of p. 75, and therefore the most likely procedure would be that when L. Bristow had set from there to the bottom of the page, he handed the leaf of MS back to Rendell, so that Rendell could complete the remaining four lines of the preceding paragraph when he reached the end of his stint. Second, although L. Bristow had begun setting at p. 75, it was not until p. 79 that the clicker was able to mark up the first proof imposed by him. The intervening text that he had set amounts to about eighty-six lines of type, nearly a whole slip. These lines were needed to complete slip 24 of the previous proof, set by Rendell, and probably imposed by him. Therefore L. Bristow must have passed these lines of type set by himself back to Rendell, or to the clicker. This suggests that the inclusion of names in the ink entries may indicate the compositor who imposed the proofs, most of which had been set by him, but not all. Thus in general the compositors began setting the takings given them at the new paragraph where their name was pencilled, and had set on average as many as 177 lines of type before the part of their taking they actually imposed began. Then, because only alternate proofs were noted, the next pair of proofs appears to be marked in ink as imposed by them, whether or not they had in fact set both. Thus, on MS p. 109 " L. Bris (9) slip 33. " indicates that L. Bristow was responsible for galley 9 slip 33, and it is followed on p. 130 by " Notley (11) slip 41 l.c. IV ", so that there is no record in these ink annotations that Rendell set cast-off galley 10, allocated to him, of course, in pencil. If therefore the clicker kept a debit and profit account of the lines passed backwards in this way between compositors so as to pay them fairly, he must have done so in a line-book, for his pencil and ink marks in the copy are widely discrepant from the evidence of the proofs. If one supposes that the compositors set all the text allocated to them in pencil, and compares that with the lines of type which that amounted to in the page proofs, the following figures emerge. 12 Wright's total work of c. 1865 lines set (62 MS pages) is represented in pencil as 5 cast-off galleys and in ink as 6 in proof; Rendell's c. 1900 lines (68 MS pages) as 6 cast-off and 4 in proof; Deacon's c. 1910 lines (57 MS pages) as 7 cast-off and 6 in proof; Knowles's c. 1910 lines (56 MS pages) as 6 cast-off and 4 in proof (but his name is omitted at proof 51 and his total should clearly be 6 proofs); Notley's c. 2045 lines (60 MS pages) as 6 cast-off and 6 in proof; Moore's c. 2345 lines (53 MS pages) as 7 cast-off and 4 in proof (but again his name was omitted in error at proof 17 and his total should be 6 proofs); L. Bristow's c. 2380 lines (74 MS pages) as 7 cast-off and 6 in proof; and finally F. Bristow's largest number of lines, c. 2560 (67 MS pages) is represented as 9 cast-off galleys and 8 galley proofs. The ink entries may have had one further purpose. The fact that the clicker noted only alternate galley proofs indicates that he was thinking in terms of the 16-page signatures of the next round of proofs. His ink annotations may indicate which compositors would be responsible for which pairs of galley proofs when it came to incorporating the author's corrections and revisions, and imposing the revised type into page-proofs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Surviving Galley Proofs: How Accurate Were the Compositors? The primary question which presents itself at this stage, is whether the compositors made a good job of printing Lawrence's manuscript. The document itself was not a severe challenge to a compositor. Lawrence's handwriting is characteristically neat, and even though there is heavy revision in a number of places, the result is always legible. From time to time it is difficult to distinguish his "h" from his "k", his small from his capital "c" and "s", or a new line from an indentation for a new paragraph; but these are not matters that would lead to a serious corruption of the text. Garnett had been systematically through the manuscript, marking in pencil and confirming in ink passages for deletion, and censoring by removal or minor alteration isolated words and sentences; and at the same time he had occasionally clarified or changed the paragraphing. There remained Lawrence's use of dialect in speech, but in fact this only rarely led the compositors into error. The thing that did, however, present them with a major stumbling block, was his punctuation, which differed in a variety of ways from their house-styling practice. Omitting from the total such categories of house-styling as regularisation of the length of dashes, the insertion of hyphens in words like "to-day", and various normalisations of spelling, the average number of changes in punctuation, paragraphing, and hyphenation introduced by the compositors amounts to approximately ten per page or one nearly every four lines, in a book totalling c. 18,050 lines of type. Finally, the evidence of the few extant galley proofs is that the compositors made a small number of substantive errors not all of which were corrected in the first edition. The main problem is that because so few galley proofs survive, other similar errors cannot easily be distinguished from revisions which Lawrence might have made on the lost galley proofs and the lost set of revised page proofs. The surviving galley proofs were set, on the evidence of the clicker's marks in the manuscript, by Moore, Knowles and L. Bristow. Moore The fragment of galley proofs set by Moore comes from his stint of cast-off galleys 44-46A (MS pp. 478-500) in the long taking of MS pp. 417-516 shared by him and F. Bristow which covered the end of chapter XII, chapter XIII, and nearly half of chapter XIV. This specimen of Moore's work represents his setting of a passage from chapter XIII beginning midword in a description of Clara's passionate preoccupation with Paul during working hours at the factory (MS p. 486; E1 p. 353): "[Every second she ex]-pected him to come through the door," and ending with Paul's return home to his mother after his fight with Baxter Dawes (MS p. 498; E1 p. 368): "She was there, he was in her hands." Moore set this passage, the longest specimen of the three compositors' work, in 704 lines of type and introduced a total of 232 punctuation changes (counting pairs of brackets and inverted commas as one). This is approximately one every three lines, a higher rate than the other two compositors, but Moore made less serious substantive errors. These were "marram" for MS "marrain" and "train" for MS "tram", both of which Lawrence corrected on the galley proofs; and "every" for MS "ever", which had been cleared up by the first edition. Moore also corrected four substantive errors in the manuscript: "always" for MS "alway", "One evening as Paul" for MS "One as Paul", and "one" for MS error "on", all of which were probably pen-slips. Finally, he set a correct form, "different from", instead of Lawrence's "different to", which, being spoken by a character (Clara) rather than the narrator, may possibly have been a deliberate grammatical error (MS p. 495; E1 p. 364). In addition to his many alterations of punctuation, Moore corrected two small punctuation slips in the manuscript, and introduced six changes of paragraph. Finally, he omitted one meaning-bearing comma, which Lawrence reinserted on the galley-proofs, after "Behind" in: "Paul glanced round. Behind, the houses stood on the brim of the dip, black against the sky, looking like wild beasts . . ." (MS p. 497; E1 p. 366). Knowles Knowles and L. Bristow finished the last twenty-four pages of the MS. Knowles's cast-off galleys 50 and 51 covered nearly all the second half of chapter XIV, and L. Bristow's cast-off galley 52 started on the last page of the chapter and continued to the end of chapter XV. Knowles began in the middle of Mrs Morel's illness but the surviving specimen of his work begins after her death, with Walter Morel's words: "'No!' he said. 'Why—has she gone?'" (MS p. 523; E1 p. 401) and it ends with the end of his taking and the start of L. Bristow's (MS p. 531; E1 p. 410), in the middle of the final scene between Paul, Clara and Baxter Dawes where, at Clara's decision not to go back to Nottingham with Paul, Baxter "jerked suddenly, as if he had been held on a strain. He looked out over the sea, but he saw nothing." This fragment is 406 lines of type, the smallest of the three specimens, and in it Knowles made the fewest punctuation changes, only 76, which is about one every five and a third lines, and he introduced only one new paragraph. His substantive errors were also fewer, being only two, but they were more serious than Moore's and neither of them was picked up by Lawrence or the proof-correctors. In the first, Knowles omitted the word "now", which seems a trivial slip, but it may be significant that L. Bristow also omitted this word. Here (MS p. 524; E1 p. 402), Lawrence was describing Walter Morel's inability to look at his dead wife: ". . . he got out of the room again and left her. He never looked at her again. He had not seen her now for months, because he had not dared to look." Knowles's second error occurred during the initial awkward moments after Clara's arrival in the Skegness lodgings shared briefly by Paul and Baxter, when Paul, covering his unease by busily making arrangements, urged Clara to change out of her wet boots and offered her his slippers. Knowles set "felt" for "left" in the concluding sentence (MS p. 529; E1 p. 408): "He put the slippers near her feet. She left them there." The error was not corrected on the proofs, and "felt" continued to be printed until the 1960s. L. Bristow The third compositor, L. Bristow, who set the second largest share of the book, c. 2380 lines or thirteen percent of the whole, made in this extract of 520 lines (or twenty percent of his total share) ten substantive errors, four of which remained unnoticed, and 129 punctuation changes, an average of one every four lines. He made no changes of paragraphing but inserted one dubious substantive correction of MS and omitted one significant comma. L. Bristow began at a new paragraph on the second lines of MS p. 531 (E1 p. 410), beginning "'There are one or two books in the corner,' said Morel." When he had set the page, which ended the chapter, he probably handed the leaf back to Knowles, so that he could set the last words of the preceding paragraph, which were the top line on this leaf: "over the sea, but he saw nothing." On this first page, where, at the very end of the chapter (MS p. 531), Clara asked Baxter to take her back, and ". . . put her fingers through his fine, thin dark hair . . .", L. Bristow made his first error, setting "her fingers through her . . . hair". Since this reading makes sense, only Lawrence would be likely to notice the error. He overlooked it on the galley proofs but the correct reading was restored in the first edition (E1 p. 411). Similarly, Lawrence did not notice at once that his "saw, far away," had been printed as "saw far, far away," but by the first edition the reduplication had been removed and the phrase reduced simply to "saw" (MS p. 533; E1 p. 413). The next error may have been set correctly but while the lines of type were being moved, the word "his" was dropped from the beginning of one line: "his own glass on the slopped, mahogany board. There was", and replaced at the end. The resulting nonsense was spotted by the printer's reader who wrote the correction onto the proofs before they were sent to Lawrence (MS p. 534; E1 p. 514). L. Bristow then understandably misread Lawrence's "k" as "h" and set "Colwich" for "Colwick" twice in one paragraph (MS p. 535; E1 p. 416). Only Lawrence could decide these spellings were wrong, and he corrected only one of them, the other remaining in a number of subsequent editions despite the obvious inconsistency. Another slip, "quiet" for "quite", was self-evident in context and had been corrected by the first edition (MS p. 536; E1 p. 417). L. Bristow's last four errors are more serious and three of them have never been corrected. In the last meeting between Paul and Miriam, Lawrence inserted an extension of Miriam's inner monologue in very small handwriting at the bottom of MS p. 538, beginning with the sentences: "Oh, why did not he take her! Her very soul belonged to him. Why would not he take what was his!" The first of the inversions "not he" L. Bristow set correctly but the second he reversed to the more common "he not" (E1 p. 420). A few lines later he omitted the word "now", written clearly if small, and not obscured by interlinear revision: "'Stop now all this restlessness and beating against death . . .'". The word has never been restored (MS p. 539; E1 p. 421). But when, a few lines further on, L. Bristow again reversed Lawrence's word order, the error was more easily identified: on the galley proofs Lawrence corrected "By her tone she knew he was despising him" back to "he knew she" (MS p. 539; E1 p. 421). Finally, on the last, now damaged, page of the manuscript Lawrence had first written, of Paul's tilt towards despair: "On every side the immense dark silences seemed pressing him into extinction, and yet, tiny speck, he could not be extinct" (MS p. 540). Then he changed the middle of the sentence to: "pressing him, so tiny a speck, into extinction, and yet, almost nothing, he could not be extinct" (E1 p. 422). Lawrence wrote his revision "so tiny a speck" very small, right at the edge of the page where it is difficult to read, but there is no doubt from the context that this is the reading he intended. However, L. Bristow set "so tiny a spark", which has never been corrected. L. Bristow also "corrected" Lawrence's prose by inserting a conjunction into the disjointed perceptions of Paul's "semi-intoxicated trance" at the opening of "Derelict". I quote the passage in full because it exemplifies both the deliberate disjointedness of the prose and some typical effects of the compositors' punctuation changes: Suddenly, the electric light went out, there was a bruising thud in the penny-in-the-slot meter. He did not stir, sat gazing in front of him. Only, the mice had scuttled and the fire glowed red in the dark room. (MS p. 533). Suddenly the electric light went out; there was a bruising thud in the penny-in-the-slot meter. He did not stir, but sat gazing in front of him. Only the mice had scuttled, and the fire glowed red in the dark room. (E1 p. 414) The lack of conjunction in the second sentence has a parallel in the first, where the comma separating "light went out, there was a bruising thud" in MS suggests Paul's disjointed perception of the near-simultaneous events. In the third sentence, Lawrence's "Only," meant "But", and this was a common usage of his which frequently depended on the comma; but L. Bristow's removal of the comma changes the meaning to "The mice alone . . ." . Finally, in the near-famous last sentence of the novel (MS p. 540): "He walked towards the faintly humming, glowing town, quickly.", L. Bristow removed the comma before "quickly", but Lawrence restored it on the galley proof (E1 p. 423). In the manuscript the comma had originally been written over a full stop, and "quickly" was added after the sentence had been completed without it. Therefore Lawrence's reinstatement of the comma indicates that its rhetorical value was important to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Punctuation Changes Not all the changes to Lawrence's MS punctuation made by the compositors altered the specific meaning of a word, as in the case of "Only," cited above. But Lawrence used commas to introduce pauses in the narratorial voice which frequently carry a subtle innuendo, and he indicated tones of voice in speech by unorthodox use of punctuation, particularly question marks, exclamation marks and dashes, a large number of which were altered throughout the novel by the printers' house-styling. Some typical effects are illustrated below by a series of parallel quotations from the galley proofs. (1) Removal of commas The house was empty, except for her. (MS p. 523) The house was empty except for her. (Knowles E1 p. 401) (In this case, the "her" is the corpse of Mrs. Morel: hence the pause indicated by the comma.) "Have you seen her?" Annie asked of him, sharply, after breakfast. (MS p. 524) "Have you seen her?" Annie asked of him sharply after breakfast. (Knowles E1 p. 402) He never thought of her, personally. Everything deep in him he denied. (MS p. 525) He never thought of her personally. . . . (Knowles E1 p. 403) (In his preoccupation with Walter Morel's deeper side, Lawrence somehow makes the comma lead the reader to take "personally" to indicate both Mrs and Mr Morel, to include the meaning as it affected himself ; whereas Knowles's removal of the comma leads the sentence to suggest something like her as a person .) Still the curls were fine and free, but her face was much older. . . . (MS p. 537) Still, the curls were fine and free, but her face was much older. . . . (L. Bristow, E1 p. 418) (Here "Still" picks up references earlier in the novel to Miriam's curls; the compositor suggests a concessive "Still" meaning "Even so", or "At least".) (2) Exclamation mark changed to question mark "But perhaps even then you were a bigger fool," said Dawes. There was a touch of triumph and malice in it. "Do you think so!" said Paul. They were silent for some time. (MS p. 527) . . ."Do you think so?" said Paul. . . . (Knowles E1 p. 406) (3) The introduction of exclamation marks "Sit down, Jack", he said. "I don't want that chair," said Dawes. "Sit down," Morel commanded. (MS p. 528) . . ."Sit down!" Morel commanded. (Knowles E1 p. 407) (4) Removal of dashes "When are you going back?" she asked. "Well—the rooms are taken until tomorrow, so he wants me to stop. He's going back tonight." (MS p. 529) . . . "Well, the rooms. . . . (Knowles E1 p. 408) (Dawes appears to hesitate more with Lawrence's dash, and to be more composed with Knowles's comma.) He was a mean fellow after all—to take what he wanted and then give her back. (MS p. 530) He was a mean fellow, after all, to take what he wanted and then give her back. (Knowles E1 p. 409) (Lawrence's dash suggests: "So, in the end he turns out to be a mean fellow!—on the evidence of the fact that he takes what he wants and then gives her back." Knowles's commas suggest: "You must admit that he was a mean fellow to take what he wanted and then give her back.") "Oh, I don't think it won't be a great deal. Only you'll find earning your own living isn't everything." "No," she said, swallowing with difficulty. "I don't suppose it is—" "I suppose work can be nearly everything to a man," he said. . . . (MS p. 537) . . . "No," she said, swallowing with difficulty; "I don't suppose it is." (L. Bristow E1 p. 418) (Lawrence's dash tantalisingly suggests Miriam might have said more but was interrupted by Paul; L. Bristow takes her statement as final.) (5) Removal of exclamation marks "Goodbye!" he said to Clara. "Goodbye," she said, giving him her hand. (MS p. 531) "Good-bye," he said to Clara. "Good-bye," she said, giving him her hand. (L. Bristow E1 p. 410) "Must you go straight home?" She looked at him, then hid her face under her hat brim. "No," she said. "No! It's not necessary." (MS p. 535) . . . "No," she said "—no; it's not necessary." (L. Bristow E1 p. 416) (In both these instances Lawrence's exclamation mark suggests a sort of rousing out of lethargy, a rising to the occasion, on the part of the speaker; L. Bristow's punctuation makes them sound more neutral.) (6) Question mark added "Hm!" he said, as she paused at a sketch. "I'd forgotten that! It's not bad, is it." "No!" she said. . . . (MS p. 536) "H'm!" he said, as she paused at a sketch. "I'd forgotten that. It's not bad, is it?" "No," she said. . . . (L. Bristow E1 p. 417) (All the tones of voice are affected here by the removal of exclamation marks and the change from fullstop to question mark.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Printer's Reader's Revisions Before the proofs were despatched to London they were marked up at Billing and Sons with corrections of typographical errors and suggestions for revision. In the first sequence of surviving galleys the queried readings were accompanied by " qy ." in the margin, in the later sequence by "?". This suggests that more than one person was responsible for marking up the proofs. Lawrence responded to the majority of their promptings. He evidently did not wish to reconsider the words "shapen" and "realest" which were underlined and queried in the margin, for he merely deleted the query (MS pp. 486, 532; E1 pp. 353, 413). But where three words were underlined and queried in his description of Dawes as "trying to get by unnoticed past every person he met", Lawrence deleted "by" and the query (MS p. 495; E1 p. 363). A similar query in the margin, without specific underlining, against "his experience had been It and not Clara" led Lawrence to replace "It" with "impersonal" (MS p. 489; E1 p. 356). In a tidy-minded vein the proof-reader underscored two sentences in a paragraph describing how Miriam sat with her "hands . . . clasped over her knee," and then, five sentences later, "suddenly took her finger from her mouth . . ." (MS pp. 57-58; E1 p. 419). Lawrence obligingly inserted a sentence: "She put her finger between her lips." The final query concerned a repetition in the fourth paragraph from the end of the novel: "a level fume of lights. Beyond the town the country, little fuming spots for more towns . . .". Lawrence changed "fuming" to "smouldering", and then made three more changes to the paragraph, which he might not perhaps have focussed upon, had his attention not been drawn to "fume-fuming" (MS p. 540; E1 p. 422). In addition he deleted "low fuming of the" four sentences from the end of the novel (MS p. 540; E1 p. 423): "Turning sharply, he walked towards the low fuming of the city's gold phosphorescence." In some instances the proof-readers did not merely enter a query and leave Lawrence to revise or not, they made specific suggestions. In chapter XIII, the reader wrote " qy. trs. " and circled the words "nights" and "evenings" in the sentence: "The days were often a misery to her, but the nights and the evenings were usually a bliss to them both." Lawrence's word order had prioritised "nights" as the time most significant of the physical bond between Paul and Clara: the evenings were of secondary importance as leading up to the nights. By contrast the reduction to mere chronological order is banal; but only the query is deleted, and the words were reversed in the page proofs (MS p. 486; E1 p. 353). Towards the end of chapter XV, where Miriam admired the flowers on Paul's table, L. Bristow had printed correctly one of Lawrence's MS sentences lacking a conjunction: "'Have them!' he said, and he took them out of the jar, dripping as they were, went quickly into the kitchen." The reader entered a caret mark after "were," and wrote: "? and /" in the margin, and Lawrence deleted the query (MS p. 539; E1 p. 421). The other intervention of this kind was to a sentence rendered ambiguous by L. Bristow's omission of a comma: "He wanted everything to stand still so he could be with her again." The reader wrote "? that" in the margin, and Lawrence both reinserted a comma after "still" and deleted the query (MS p. 532; E1 p. 413). Finally, the punctuation was altered in two places. Both instances occur in the passages following the eighth paragraph of chapter XV. Towards the end of Paul's semi-intoxicated inner dialogue Lawrence had written: "Painting is not living." "Then live." "Marry whom?" came the sulky question. "As best you can." "Miriam." But he did not trust that. What he did not trust was a statement, but the proof-reader deleted the fullstop and wrote "?/" in the margin. It was not altered, and '"Miriam?"' appears in the page proofs (MS p. 533-534; E1 p. 414). In the other case, fifteen lines later, Lawrence's punctuation was entirely adequate to his meaning: "Sometimes he ran down the streets as if he were mad. Sometimes he was mad: things weren't there, things were there." (MS p. 534). But the compositor, L. Bristow, had revised it to: "Sometimes he ran down the streets as if he were mad: sometimes he was mad, things weren't there, things were there" (E1 p. 415). The proof-reader deleted the comma after "mad" and wrote ";/" in the margin. The evidence which makes it possible to distinguish the handwriting of punctuation revisions is given in the section below describing Lawrence's response to the house-styling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward Garnett's Revisions to the Galley Proofs When Edward Garnett checked through these proofs before forwarding them to Lawrence, he directed his attention to the early morning swim taken by Clara and Paul in chapter XIII. Lawrence had written two similar sentences a few paragraphs apart: "OO" she said, hugging her breasts between her arms, "it's cold!" . . . She gathered her breasts between her arms, cringing, laughing. "OO, it will be so cold!" she said. He bent forward and kissed the two white glistening globes she cradled. (MS p. 491; E1 p. 358). Garnett had already censored the passage when preparing the manuscript for the printer by changing the last sentence to "He kissed her neck." Now, on the proofs, he deleted the first of Clara's exclamations, and changed "gathered" to "hugged". He may have done this to remove a repetition, but it seems likely that his motivation was also censorship. Given how slight were the revisions that constituted censorship in The White Peacock , such as the removal of "have a real bellyful of me" in favour of "be really glutted with me", 13 it is quite possible that Garnett judged "gathered" to suggest an image of Clara presenting her breasts to Paul and "hugged" of covering them up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lawrence's Response to the House-styling The surviving galley proofs amount to 1630 lines of type and in them there are 437 differences of punctuation from manuscript (counting pairs of brackets and inverted commas as one). Lawrence did not change any punctuation, but he added a little, nearly all of which had been in his MS. This provides an insight into the nature of his attention to punctuation. He made eight interventions. Three have been discussed above. 14 The others are as follows. In chapter XIII Lawrence had made Paul reflect on Clara as they dried themselves after their swim (MS p. 492; E1 p. 360): "'But she is magnificent, and even bigger than the morning and the sea.—Is she?—is she?'" The compositor, Moore, had set this without the dashes and Lawrence reinserted dashes but in a different place: ". . . Is she—? is she—?" It seems highly improbable that anyone but Lawrence should have entered this change on the proofs, and since the notation used is a long slash which bends upwards at the end so that it looks like a tick, this provides the evidence by which it is possible to identify Lawrence's punctuation revisions. When he entered verbal revisions he used a straight slash in the margin, as did the proofreaders. Later in the same chapter, after the fight, Baxter Dawes returned to Nottingham (MS p. 498; E1 p. 368): "And dimly in his consciousness as he went, he felt on his foot the place where his boot had knocked against on[e] of the lad's bones." Moore omitted the comma, as did Knowles in chapter XIV: after Mrs. Morel's death, Walter Morel waited up late for Paul to return home (MS p. 524; E1 p. 402): "Paul realised with a start that he had been afraid to go to bed, alone in the house with his dead." The fact that Lawrence reinstated these commas suggests that he heard a pause in these sentences. In the second example the comma is essential to the meaning: "alone in the house"; Moore's omission of it introduces a possible ambiguity: "to bed alone." Finally, L. Bristow had set precisely Lawrence's MS version of a sentence near the start of chapter XV which ideally required a comma (after "so"), and Lawrence provided it on the proofs (MS p. 532; E1 p. 412): "It hurt him so that things had lost their reality." Statistically, Lawrence's alterations to the compositors' punctuation changes were minimal, but they underline the rhetorical element in his own practice. There is some evidence from The White Peacock proofs 15 that at the outset of his career he had tried to reverse more of the printer's house-styling, but he probably gave up the unequal struggle. Since this novel had been cut and censored, he had more urgent matters to attend to, and indeed, as was his habitual practice, he entered a larger number of substantive revisions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lawrence's Substantive Revisions on the Proofs There is insufficient space here to quote or discuss Lawrence's revisions, but the statistics are revealing. On the surviving galley proofs, he rewrote words and sentences in twenty-nine places, only two of them in response to a query in the margin. He deleted material in twelve places. But his additions were infrequent: he added the sentence about Miriam putting her finger between her lips, and a further three short phrases of three, five and seven words. Not only did Lawrence delete and rewrite or simply delete far more than he added, he also did so far more than the proofreaders and Garnett. Although the "interference" provided by them, which we now know about, is sometimes dramatic, we may perhaps be reassured that it does not loom larger. It is regrettable that more of the author's proofs have not survived, but we must be grateful for the information supplied by this small sample.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It is puzzling that Mark Sexton should assert (in his "Lawrence, Garnett, and Sons and Lovers : An Exploration of Author-Editor Relationship", Studies in Bibliography , 43 [1990], 209) that "neither the galley nor page proofs survive", since both page and galley proofs are listed in Warren Roberts's A Bibliography of D. H. Lawrence , 2nd ed. (1982), p. 524. 2 Mark Schorer, ed., Sons and Lovers, a facsimile of the manuscript (1977). 3 See James T. Boulton, ed., The Letters of D. H. Lawrence , vol. 1 (1979), 421-424 and footnotes; hereafter Letters . 4 Letters 1: 476-477, 481-482; George Jefferson, Edward Garnett, A Life in Literature (1982), p. 150. 5 These galley proofs are deposited at Nottingham University Library, U.K. Mr. Guy Collings has no theory as to what happened to the rest; they are not among the materials which Ernest Collings left to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. 6 See my " Sons and Lovers The Surviving Manuscripts from Three Drafts Dated by Paper Analysis", in Studies in Bibliography , 38 (1985), 289-328. 7 Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), p. 193. 8 The annotations are in more than one hand, but as it is now impossible to identify the writers, it is simpler for the purposes of general exposition to refer to the annotations as if they were all by the clicker. 9 The fact that the galleys as cast off did not tally precisely with the galleys as printed means that simple reference to "galleys" is confusing. The following account will therefore, refer to "galley-trays" "cast-off galleys" and "galley proofs". 10 I am grateful to Dr. Gaskell for help with these calculations. 11 At least as they are represented by the page proofs, where the differences in the text caused by Lawrence's revisions would at most alter one or two lines per page and would not for present purposes materially affect quantities across whole galley proofs. 12 Despite Lawrence's revisions on the galley proofs which altered the exact number of lines in the same sections of page proofs, these still are more accurate figures than can be calculated by reference to the manuscript. 13 See The White Peacock , ed. Andrew Robertson (1982), pp. xxxv, 150, 380. 14 They were "Behind, the houses . . ."; "to stand still, so he could . . ."; and "town, quickly." 15 See Robertson's edition p. xxxii; he dealt with this matter more fully in his unpublished Proposal submitted to the editorial board of the Cambridge Lawrence edition.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Belated Justice to Hilaire Belloc, Versifier (1870-1953) by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the account of his friend Hilaire Belloc in the Dictionary of National Biography , Douglas Woodruff characterized him as "poet and author," remarked on his "virtuosity as a writer of comic verse," and concluded by declaring that "as a poet, and it was as a poet he most wished to be remembered, his gift was the lyric gift for the expression of deeply felt personal emotion, for love poetry, and in such a work as An Heroic Poem in Praise of Wine there are sudden personal touches of a kind from which he would always have shrunk in prose." There has been no attempt, however, on the part of any writer to determine the extent of the canon of Belloc's verse or to study the revisions in some of his verses, the first appearance of some of them being elsewhere than in the volumes of the canon. Robert Speaight's remarks on Belloc's "verse," the word Belloc preferred to "poetry" for his own efforts, are largely superficial and can safely be ignored. 1 A. N. Wilson, author of the most recent biography of Belloc, has rather more to say about Belloc's poetry, his remarks betraying a rather ambivalent opinion of the merits and shortcomings of Belloc's work. He states that since 1922 "Belloc's aspiration as a poet has declined to a point where his serious verse is only known or appreciated by a small band of enthusiasts. At the best of times he is a very uneven poet," going on to list as characteristics of the verse, "lyrical facility, metrical fluency, and the self-consciously 'beautiful' effects which have made 'Georgian' almost a term of abuse." At another juncture Wilson praises the "extraordinary magic of Belloc's light verse." 2 Reginald A. Jebb, Belloc's son-in-law and the editor of Belloc's Sonnets and Verse , stated that "To write of Belloc without mentioning his verse would be to leave out that part of his work which he himself valued most highly." Jebb is not an entirely objective critic, but his few pages, "A Note on Belloc's Verse" (89-97) in Testimony to Hilaire Belloc (1956), the first section of which I have quoted above, should be read along with other appraisals of that body of work. 3 Whatever the merits or shortcomings of Belloc's verse—and there is no doubt, of course, of his importance as a writer of prose—he deserves somewhat more justice than he has been accorded. I wish to show that Belloc took more pains with his verse than has hitherto been realized and that his Complete Verse , first published in 1954 and revised and reset in 1970, is far from complete. W. N. Roughead, another friend of Belloc's, edited both editions; "This book contains what I believe to be the whole of Belloc's poetry. . . . Here also are many verses privately printed, and some not hitherto printed for general circulation at all" (p. v). In the Preface to the 1970 edition Roughead also states that "Belloc hung on to his serious things for years, polishing and repolishing sans cesse . Not so with his lighter ones; he'd throw them off in next to no time. Just as he did with his (alas, irrecoverable) spontaneous songs and jingles, which delighted his companions at sea and ashore" (p. vi). Which, then, are the "serious pieces"—the "serious verse" which, according to Wilson, is little known and appreciated? Were the "lighter" pieces not polished at all? Should not something more have been said about the now allegedly irrecoverable "spontaneous songs and jingles"? Before presenting and analyzing the revisions made by Belloc in his verse, I wish to show how very incomplete the Complete Verse is. Robert Speaight selected and edited Letters from Hilaire Belloc , published in 1958, four years later than the 1954 Complete Verse but twelve years earlier than the 1970 edition. Three of the letters in Speaight are to Roughead, and he would have known of the edition. Hence, he must have decided not to include the 515 lines of verse in Belloc's letters to Maurice Baring, plus the 18 lines of Aphorisms (pp. 27-28), the 8 lines of his Latin translation of "Three Blind Mice" (p. 49), the 25 lines of limericks (pp. 60-61), and the 16 lines of his "Rhymes for Little Children" (pp. 114-115), also in the letters to Baring. There are 62 lines of verse in three letters to G. K. Chesterton (pp. 9, 11, 92-93), 16 in what Belloc described as "the vers libre of my fiftieth year" (p. 92). In a letter to George Wyndham he composed a "Triolet suggested by the amiable reception accorded the Author by his Excellency, the Spanish Ambassador, Senator D.C.L. on the 4th May, 1911." Bon Jour, Monsieur L'Ambassadeur, De L'Empereur de Barcelone. Je puis vous dire de grand coeur Bon Jour, Monsieur L'Ambassadeur, Vous me faites trop grand honeur En me recevant en Personne Bon Jour, Monsieur L'Ambassadeur De L'Empereur de Barcelone. (pp. 41-42) Here and for some of the other bits I shall quote, the objection may be raised that these are occasional trifles that should not be resurrected, although, as I shall point out, Belloc himself resurrected four of the sets of verses from these letters. (I shall come to other uncollected verses after recording the rest of the verse in Speaight.) A poem in a letter to Evan Charteris has 36 lines (pp. 252-253); two to Mrs. Raymond Asquith total 42 lines (pp. 185, 188-189); two to Lady Lovat total 18 lines (pp. 171, 217-218); two to Lady Juliet Duff total 10 lines (pp. 145, 201); one to Duff Cooper has 4 lines (p. 223); and one to "the Hon. Mrs. Mervyn Herbert" has 4 lines (p. 276). Unless I have added incorrectly there are 766 lines of verse in these letters. One poem in the Complete Verse has as title the first line, "They that have taken wages of things done" (p. 15). In an undated letter to Baring, that verse begins Belloc's "Sonnet addressed to the Memory of a Lady in early Middle Age, Whom the Poet had the Good Fortune to come upon by Accident in the Embrasure of a Window Situated on the Ground Floor of a Small Chateau, near Juvisy, the Poet being Then No More Than Seventeen Years in Age" (p. 55). I quote the full poem in the Letters and some lines of the version in the Complete Verse that readers may most readily see the nature of some of the revisions. They that have taken wages of things done- When sense abused has blocked the doors of sense; They that have lost their standing in the sun, Their laughter and their holy innocence; They turn to one thing now and then to t'other To stale adventurous things repeated sore; Some to the small dear field which was their mother, Some to their God which is so greatly more. But I to that strong morning where you stood In fullness of your body and with hands Reposing on your walls before your lands, And altogether making one great good. Then did I cry "For this my birth was meant These are my joys, and this my Sacrament." ( Letters ) They turn them now to this thing, now to t'other, For anchor hold against swift-eddying time, Some to that square of earth which was their mother, And some to noisy fame, and some to rhyme: ( Complete Verse ) Belloc also kept and revised a sonnet written in a letter to G. K. Chesterton. I quote the full poem in the Letters (p. 92) and the first six lines from Complete Verse (p. 19). Mother of all my cities, once there lay About your weedy wharves a langorous shower Of spice and orient silk and all the dower That ocean gave thee on his bridal day. But now thy youth and age hath passed away And all thy sails superb and all thy power. Thy time's a time of memory, like that hour Just after sunset, wonderful and grey. Too tired to rise, and much too sad to weep With strong arm nerveless on a nerveless knee Still to your silent ear the spousal deep Murmurs his thoughts of eld eternally, But your soul wakes not from its holy sleep Dreaming of dead delights along a tideless sea. ( Letters ) Mother of all my cities, once there lay About your weedy wharves an orient shower Of spice and languorous silk and all the dower That Ocean gave you on his bridal day. And now the youth and age have passed away And all the sail superb and all the power. ( Complete Verse ) Belloc did not, however, keep his vers libre poem in Venice; at least it is not in the Complete Verse . The poem Decameron in Complete Verse (p. 102), with its first line, "Maia, Ridalvo, Brangwen, Amoreth," had its origin in a letter to Mrs. Raymond Asquith, the first line reading "Romande, Alise, Maltas, Amoreth," a change noted by Speaight ( Letters , p. 185, n.2). Belloc also elected to keep his two-line motto for Lady Lovat's sundial (p. 171). One has, then, additional evidence of Belloc's lasting interest in some of the verses dashed off in letters to friends. Recourse to Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes's Young Hilaire Belloc (1956) and to J. B. Morton's Hilaire Belloc: A Memoir (1955) makes it possible to add further to the canon. Morton quotes an "excellent ditty" of 6 lines (p. 30) and recalls and quotes 6 lines from "a song which I only heard him sing once; a passionate appeal to his friends to make a place for him in Heaven" (pp. 42-43). The following four lines are also available in print solely in Morton's Memoir : Anne Boleyn had no breeches to wear, So the King got a sheepskin and cut her a pair; Skinside out and woolly side in— It was warm in the summer for Anne Boleyn. (p. 45) And on a card "written when he was going to sea" was written "in large letters . . . 'Me for the Salt,'" and then: Home they brought her warrior dead, With his belly full of lead. Pity they could not contrive To bring her warrior home alive. (p. 113) Only 20 more lines, but all must have entry into the canon. Complete editions of the poetry of any writer include Juvenilia. (Did Samuel Johnson write a poem on a duck he had trodden on? He did write a poem on a daffodil when fifteen or sixteen years old.) Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes recalls and prints what is probably Belloc's earliest attempt at verse—he was six years old. I had a little Fly I called it Silver Wing And over little bits of thread This little Fly would Spring. I made it little hedges Of little bits of thread; And I made a stick-Memorial When this little Fly was Dead! (p. 36) At seven, Belloc, "deeply impressed by the loss of the Eurydice ," a man-of-war lost in a storm with almost all on board drowned, dictated a 21-line poem to a Mrs. Mew (pp. 38-39). At nine, a poem of 16 lines, The Nameless Knight (pp. 43-44), soon followed by 18 lines on "a place near Slindon," verses to which he signed his name and the date, 1880 (pp. 44-45). At thirteen, on Notre Dame, 14 lines in a letter to his mother (p. 69). At age twelve or thirteen, immersed in Homer, he wrote "I send you a poem . . . the idea being the whiff of cold Atlantic on Grecian Ulysses" (p. 71). The poem of 21 lines shows precocity that was not there in the earlier attempts. But most when evening comes I seem to hear The sheep bells tinkling on the heather-height, And the loud whirring of the birds' low flight, Hieing them westwards as the darkness falls. And comes to me the sight of all most dear, The woody dell which nestles round the halls Which are my end; aye, and that only face Which I have waited long and may not see. Memories so sweet they flood a barren place. Where mine eyes, weary of a restless sea Grey-hearing, yet as having lost its scope Of changing mood comes dark upon my hope, And chills my soul with sad monotony. Through the black waters as of old to roam Were freedom; rather look I on the blue And pierce its narrow boundary till all fair Against the rosened East I seem to see Beyond my prison bars of circling foam That which my hard fate will not give to me. Rest, and the heath and all surcease of care, Strong in the waters, I thaca my home! (pp. 71-72) The "rosened" of line 17 is curious, the OED giving examples only into the fifteenth century. In 1885 Belloc sent his mother a birthday poem, 21 lines in length, celebrating France, the land of his birth (p. 76). What may be Belloc's first published poem, Storm , 31 lines, appeared in 1886—he was sixteen. He wrote to his mother, "I am so glad that Findlay [otherwise unidentified] accepted the poem. I was very proud, of course he took the 'ceaseless surging'" (p. 82). And what may be his first love poem was to Minna Hope, sister of his friend James Hope, 23 lines of forgettable verse (pp. 84-85). In 1888 he sent his mother a poem of 24 lines, provisionally titled Siren's Song , which he characterized as "badly executed and hangs loosely" (pp. 91, 92). The following poem was "scribbled on the back of a letter" to his mother, and alludes to Elodie Hogan whom he was soon to marry: Little Child Jesus was born in a stable, I am a child and pray when I'm able. I pray when I'm able—and then at the end I remember to pray very hard for a friend Who will come on a hollow boat over the sea, Little Child Jesus, have mercy on me. (p. 133) There exist, available in print, both in its original printing 4 and in Speaight's biography (pp. 263-264), Belloc's verses, 30 in number, of an Ode to the West Wind which he was unable to complete. Speaight's biography yields another 86 lines of verse. I shall list and describe them seriatim: p. 25, a 4-line translation of the opening speech of Antigone in her confrontation with Creon; p. 166, a 2-line translation of two lines in the Chanson de Roland ; p. 276, a 10-line verse epistle to Baring ("Dear Maurice / You write better than Horace"); pp. 439-440, 30 lines on members of the English Embassy in Paris; p. 466, 6 lines on "Lord Grampus" who "committed fraud / By not declaring knickers bought abroad"; p. 497, 8 lines on the baptism of his god-daughter; p. 497, a triolet in French, 8 lines beginning "De sousmarins la mer est pleine"; p. 498, 12 lines of French verse in a letter to Lady Diana Cooper, beginning "Diane chasseresse / Deese enchantresse"; p. 504, 4 lines on "parson-ridden" Florence and "heavenly" Orvieto; and, p. 524, a 4-line variation on "bring back my Bonnie to me" beginning "My Bonnie has tuberculosis." I count 319 lines of verse in these last three sources, bringing the total, when the 766 lines in the Letters are added, to 1085. Speaight reports in his biography (p. 104) that "one or two juvenilia in the Irish Monthly " were among Belloc's first published poems. There are two poems in the Irish Monthly ; one, The Night , is in Complete Verse (p. 29), originally printed in volume 18 (1890) of the periodical (p. 534). The other poem, Mixed Metaphors , was printed in volume 17 (1889): Being a child that's playing by the sea, Picking up pebbles on the shores of time, This placid fishing for the evasive Rhyme Is sure as good as other playthings be. You who have toiled so much still weep, while we Reproachèd are with joy as with a crime: When I consider "every man's a mime" What part I play is quite the same to me If only you, O mighty audience! That in the soft deep-cushioned stalls do sit, Clap your thin hands and make a vain pretence Of praise for that which tires—I laugh at it. I seek the plaudits of your keener sense, Beer-drinking Demos-people in the pit! (p. 154) This, too, should be included in an edition of the complete verse. Belloc did tinker with his verse; some examples of such tinkering have already been given. Should there be a Complete Verse in the future, the variants in these examples and in those which I now present should be recorded. If Belloc's verse is worth an edition of the entire corpus, it should be both complete and scholarly. Speaight devotes a few pages (150-154) in his biography to Belloc's contributions to The Speaker , the periodical edited by G. K. Chesterton, but he has very little to say about the verse Belloc contributed. For example, he and Roughead overlook this Sonnet which appeared in volume three (Dec. 1900). I sometimes fancy that thou hast conspired With the Moon's Goddess, there to take her place, When with her wood-nymphs in nocturnal chase She fain would roam; while thou round earth untired Dost float, by sweet hope to such service hired, Gazing upon it with clear steadfast face, Or peering down through clouds that overlace Night's roof with silver, seeking thy desired. And when thou findest him, with every beam Thou talkest of thy love: though severed far, Our vigilant souls in deep communion are, As once when face to face, until I seem, Drawn by thy love beyond life's utmost bar, With thee to tread the temple of thy dream. The poem is unsigned in its appearance on page 229 but is attributed to Belloc in the Index. Speaight quotes the first two lines of Dives , a poem whose sixth line in its appearance in The Speaker (3:683), "To that dull shore where all our burdens end," is revised to "Down the dull shore where all our journeys end," which may or may not be a change for the better, "burdens" being more consonant with the first five lines of the poem, with the image of the two men staggering under their packs. There is one other of Belloc's poems in this third volume. The title, Song (Inviting an influence upon the opening year ) (p. 293), is changed to Song Inviting the Influence of a Young Lady Upon the Opening Year in the Complete Verse . Further revisions exist, the original version given first and then that in Complete Verse , here and in what follows: l. 3, And as/When as; l. 10, Enchantment/Commandment. The title of a poem in the first volume of The Speaker is also changed and there are three variants in the text, A Dedication. With a Book of Verse becoming Dedication of 'Verses' 1910 to John Swinnerton Phillimore , much more specific, especially in the addition of Phillimore's name, as he was an early and life-long friend of Belloc's (p. 262). The variants: l. 1, little tiny boys/little boys; l. 4, That/Which; l. 8 forms/form. 5 Somewhat more revision occurs in the poem The Leader , also in volume 1 (p. 566): l. 1, the knell/a knell; l. 10 faëry/faery; l. 13, marks/sends; l. 21, the dead/two dead; l. 25, the rout/that rout; l. 27 fighting/marching; l. 28 half a score/twenty score; l. 35, The night had left the endless plains/She led us to the endless plains. The change from "half a score" to "twenty score" is most striking and more in keeping with the "hundred thousand" men of the preceding line. The Politician in volume 6 (p. 112) is somewhat emasculated for its inclusion in Complete Verse (pp. 159-161), the variants being in l. 29, That England/My country; l. 32, And (as you mention the defeats/. . . As to the African defeats; l. 39, Canon Gore's/Thingumbob's. The title is expanded to The Politician or The Irish Earldom . Canon Gore is Charles Gore, whose eligibility for the Bishopric of Worcester was a matter of controversy. 6 Lines Suggested by the Reading During a Solitary Lunch at the Holborn Restaurant of a Criticism Written by Some Academic Fellow Upon the Literary Works of My Friend Mr. Gilbert Chesterton printed in The Speaker for January 23, 1904 (9:408), appears as the uninformative Lines to a Don in Complete Verse (pp. 153-155). But this is not the only change (the original is given first): l. 7, Prayers/Bed; l. 21, How/Don; ll. 51-53, We have a standing rule which fines / Contributors a five pound note / Unless they cut the stuff they wrote//There is a Canon which confines / A Rhymed Octosyllabic Curse / If written in Iambic Verse; l. 57, yet/but. I believe the "Academic Fellow" of the early title was James Augustus Henry Murray, the editor of the OED . He reviewed Chesterton's Robert Browning in the English Men of Letters series for The Sunday Sun , May 31, 1903, and while the review began on a positive note ("a really charming and delightful little volume") and so continued for the long first paragraph, Murray then turned to his many objections to Chesterton's treatment of Fra Lippo Lippi and, especially, of Bishop Blougram in the poems on those two men. He also believed Chesterton to be a "Puritan" who brought a "certain straight-lacedness" to his treatment of Bishop Blougram. Seven years later Murray wrote a piece for the London Bookman on Chesterton titled "A Man of Genius." Here, too, the praise for Chesterton's talents was not unqualified. The poem in volume 11 of The Speaker (p. 314), Stanzas Written on Battersea Bridge During the Prevalence of the Late South-West Gale , is abbreviated in its title by the omission of "the Prevalence of the Late," the word "a" following "During." There are seven variants: l. 5, heat/feet; l. 11 road for home/Hampton road; l. 25, course my Pilotry/Pilotry my soul; l. 26, That I may/Whereby to; l. 27, clean/extreme; l. 29, Nor leading marks on little piers and paven/We shall not round the granite piers and paven; l. 35, But. . . . The/Oh! . . . A. Two poems in volume thirteen are slightly revised. The Prophet Lost in the Hills at Evening (p. 391) exhibits three changes: l. 12, thickly/softly; l. 20, Protect me out of/Redeem me from; l. 26, Secret/ bleeding. The title of the second poem, Verses Addressed to Lord Halifax (p. 554), is considerably expanded, yet without Lord Halifax being named, to Verses to a Lord who, in the House of Lords, Said that Those Who Opposed the South African Adventure Confused Soldiers With Money-Grabbers , with one variant in the text: l. 13, river banks/little mound. The biographer of Lord Halifax merely refers to "an incident which took place" during the rule of Lord Milner, for which he was to be censured had not Halifax spoken in his defence. There is no mention of Belloc's verses. 7 There are also two poems in volume 14. The Angevin (p. 95) becomes The Ring in Complete Verse , with a number of variants: l. 6, Of . . . of/ With . . . with; l. 9, a ring a woman/of the ring the heart; l. 11, Diamond/ writing; l. 13, For/Now; l. 9, of/in; l. 16, Selsea/Selsey; 8 l. 18, all/what. The Rebel (p. 209) undergoes two changes: l. 20, press/have; l. 30, cut/back. Belloc's poem The Night ( Complete Verse , p. 29) was first published in Irish Monthly , volume 18 (Oct. 1890), p. 534. There are 7 variants, the earlier text given first: l. 5, And bid the drowsy songs/And let the far lament; l. 6, Chant/Chaunt; l. 9, Bid/Let; l. 11, strange dreams/new dreams; l. 13, thy/ your; l. 14, day-dawn/dawning; l. 15, thy/your. I find it odd that Belloc should opt for "chaunt" in his revision (surely it is not a compositorial error), a spelling which OED last cites from William Cowper in 1790 in his translation of The Odyssey , when Belloc twice rejected "thy" for "your." Speaight reproduces ( en face , p. 368) "A copy of the original revision of Miranda , presented to Miranda MacKintosh by Hilaire Belloc" (which should be compared with the text in Complete Verse , pp. 64-66), noting that the title was changed to Tarantella . Extensive revision in the form of the addition of four initial stanzas occurs in The South Country . It was first published in The Living Age for October 5, 1901 (231:60). There are two variants: l. 1, the/l. 25, But the; l. 33, build/l. 57, hold. Belloc's Verses and Sonnets (1896) included Sonnets of the Twelve Months , the September sonnet being titled September [ Sedan ], inspired by the Battle of Sedan which took place on September 1, 1870. The sonnet, simply titled Sedan , was reprinted in The New Witness , volume 4 (May 7 to November 26, 1914, p. 473). Note the changes in The New Witness : l. 4 re-formed and marshalled/deployed, and stationed; l. 6 one/some; l. 10, rose . . . cloud/fled . . . clouds; l. 12, gazing/watching. Subsequent reprintings of the poem return to the original text. In 1904 Duckworth published Belloc's Avril, being Essays on the Poetry of the French Renaissance . In the chapter on Francois Malherbe, Belloc, probably influenced by Malherbe's epitaphes , wrote one of four lines which, on its appearance in Complete Verse (p. 114), bore the title Epitaph on the Politician Himself and whose second line reads, "The Politician's corpse was laid away," a revision of the original, "Killed by excess was Wormwood laid away" (p. 131). Possibly Belloc had an actual politician in mind, but that must remain in the realm of conjecture. Belloc's Ballade to Our Lady of Czestochowa originally appeared in the New Statesman on December 17, 1921, and was reprinted in the August 19, 1922, number of The Living Age . There are significant variants from the text of Complete Verse , the earlier version being first: l. 1, Spendor/Lady; ll. 13-14, Yet have you heard above the waves a cry. / And hanged above the hills a cusp of gold.//But you shall lead me to the light, and I / Shall hymn you in a harbour story told; l. 17, Helm of Old/House of Gold; l. 19, Standing/Splendour. Belloc's Ballade of Hell and Mrs. Roebeck also appeared in the New Statesman (February 4, 1922, pp. 501-502). There are substantive and intriguing changes between the text in the periodical and that in Complete Verse (p. 129), the earlier text given first: l. 3, Manderson/Manderly; l. 14, 30/20; l. 15, play/smoke; l. 17, all the weary ways/each declining phase; l. 18, tedious/emptied. The changes are intriguing in that in the earlier version it is "Manderson who never pays," while later it is "Manderly" who is delinquent. And in the earlier version it is to "number 30, Taunton Square" where the revellers go to "play," while later they repair to "number 20" where they "smoke." I had hoped to find some reference to Manderson or Manderly or to Taunton Square in the literature on Belloc, but was unsuccessful. Are the changes merely arbitrary, or are they meaningful? Speaight wrote of the Heroic Poem in Praise of Wine that "Fragments of it had appeared earlier in an essay, 'The Good Poet and the Bad Poet,' from Short Talks with the Dead (1926) and compared one couplet, "Or where, festooned about the tall elm-trees / Etrurian grapes regard Tyrrhenian seas" with the revised version, "Or where, festooned about the tall elm-trees / Tendrils are mirrored in Tyrrhenian seas," remarking "you can see the effect of Belloc's polishing. Rhetoric has been transformed into poetry" (p. 495). Comparison of the rest of the fragments in Short Talks with the final version reveals how much tinkering Belloc did. The fragments are first, the line numbers of necessity being to the complete poem. Line 1, To praise, revere/To exalt, enthrone; l. 5, the foundation/the recorder; l. 11, The cymbal and the thyrsus/The gilder Thyrsus twirling; l. 12, Of bronze among the torches,/Of cymbals through the darkness; l. 43, large/broad; l. 44, luxuriant, luxurious; l. 184, void . . . labours/waste . . . labour. Lines 185-188 of the complete poem read, "And like the vineyard worker take my way / Down the long shadows of declining day, / Bend on the sombre plain my clouded sight / And leave the mountain to the advancing night," while the fragment reads, "Turn to the home-lit plain my grateful sight / And leave the mountain to the advancing night." The complete poem then has lines 189-196 for which there is no fragment, the remaining fragment joining the complete poem at line 197, where it reads "When the poor end of such attempt is near," the complete poem reading "But when the hour of mine adventure's near." Line 199, Shallow/open. The last four lines are substantively the same. Whether the total effect of the revisions has been to transform rhetoric into poetry is in the realm of the critic. My purpose is to show Belloc reshaping the verses that went to make up part of what is probably his best-known poem. There are other verses in Short Talks with the Dead . I quote the first stanzas of "Lord Rumbo and Lord Jumbo" (p. 85), Lord Rumbo was a Democrat Who wore a very curious hat And woollen boots, and didn't think It right to smoke or take a drink. And of "Talking (And Singing) of the Nordic Man" (p. 104), Behold, my child, the Nordic man, And be as like him as you can: His legs are long, his mind is slow, His hair is lank and made of tow. Belloc devotes some five pages (130-134) to the efforts of a man of his acquaintance to improve a quatrain in a poem by Wordsworth, quoting five of those efforts. These are better forgotten. Two lines, "William, you vary greatly in your verse; / Some's none too good, but all the rest is words" (p. 136) is Belloc's suggestion for reviewing verse as it should be reviewed. In the same essay, "Talking of Bad Verse," he had recourse to four lines of verse, "Ah, years ago, but I once was there / And I wish I were there again; / By Tumty River and Tumty Weir / Along with the Tumty men" (p. 140), to illustrate the phenomenon "the kind of lilt which you get from an engine wheel with a flat in it bumping down an incline" (p. 139). And finally, the last two lines of a bad sonneteer: "Oh, England! Oh, my country! What a place / Of habitation for the Saxon Race" (p. 213). Add another 176 lines to the canon. Certain conclusions are obvious, of course. No edition should claim completeness when much already in the public domain is overlooked or omitted. The change in a title or in an allusion may illuminate the original impetus for the poem in question. And does not the failure to provide a textual apparatus lead to the suspicion that the author's works are being edited from pious motives rather than from a conviction that they are worth editing? Some of these verse ephemera are of biographical importance; they contain information that does not exist elsewhere or is in less than complete form. I append, as a first example, some lines of the second poem in the Letters (and its lengthy title): Written a little after nine at night Some distance out of Paris, but not quite As far as Bondy (where they make the bricks) The Seventeenth of April: Nineteen 'six. Dear Maurice, this is written in the train Not without labour, nor without the pain If your are rich enough to travel first They give you something I have never known From California to the Arctic Zone (And I have travelled widely and I know The "Sunset Weekly" and the "Mexico", The "Pennsylvania limited", the bed In which you try to sleep to Holyhead, The "Scotchman" up as far as Inverness, The "Côte de'Azur", the "Orient Express"— And once I sat for 15 mortal hours Straining my patience to its utmost powers Wedged tightly in between two dreadful bores From Gellivors up to Helsingfors— I mean to Hammerfest of course. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I crossed the Channel with the wind a-beam (A day in which to cross was very heaven) And got to St Lazare at ½ past seven. I caught a cab, the driver did his best, We galloped hotly to the Gare de l'Est, One extra franc was worth the pace we ran I barely caught the Special for Milan And now I'm in it. I shall get to Como At half-past two, get out and see the Duomo, Go on at half past five and sleep perhaps At Piacenza with those jolly chaps Who entertained me, now four years ago, At no 20, Via di Formio; Then, the next morning, cross the Apennine And get to Rome itself in time to dine. And why to Rome? Because the Bishops hope (The English Bishops) that Our Lord the Pope (Dominus noster Papa) when he finds A Radical who can describe the minds Of all his fellow-members, good or ill, Upon the Thorny Education Bill Will pay more heed to his conclusions than He would to those of a defeated man, A Tory, for example, or a Whig Or some rich Duke who does not care a fig For the electorate and does not know The way our politics are bound to go. You see then, I am on a sort of mission To show his Holiness the whole position And tell him how, with due respect and tact, Our schools may yet be kept alive, in fact, I go as the first liberal, for years, To speak for English Catholics, whom peers And wealthy squires have hitherto been free To mis interpret to the Holy See, And so am spending what I can't afford (Some fifteen Pounds) in Service of Our Lord. (pp. 5-7) There is material here and in others of these verses for the biographer, these verse-letters to Baring and others being virtually a diary. Did Belloc actually have an audience with Pope Pius X? The verses to Baring just quoted would seem more than to suggest that, yet there is no mention of this in Speaight's biography, although the audience is mentioned (but only that) in Wilson's (p. 211). The fullest account is in the verses. So, too, is the itinerary and chronology of the trip which culminated in the papal audience. In 1927 Belloc went to North Africa where in eight days he wrote his James II (Wilson, p. 307); his graphic description of the voyage is contained in verses he sent Mrs. Raymond Asquith. I quote roughly half of them. In the middle of the sea November 30th, 1927 Dear Katherine, I find myself afloat Upon a small and dirty cargo boat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . what's aboard, is yellow, black and brown, The derelicts of a half Eastern town, And, to direct them in a nasty fix, Of Europeans, hardly five or six: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . There is no doubt that travel on the seas Can be conducted with far greater ease By those who take the cargo and eschew Liners as I on this occasion do. Though cabins for some passengers exist I find no passengers upon the list. The table being set for seven, of whom I take it is the Mate (or in his room The Second) and Captain, probably An owner (for I find as well as me, Another person most unsuitable); Then the Third Officer, the Doctor and A man who struts about with a large band Of white upon his cap; and he, I fear, Is nothing grander than an Engineer. (pp. 188-189) In a letter to Evan Charteris, Belloc describes his physical state of being, again a fuller account than will be found in the biographies. I quote all but the last ten lines in which he arranges to meet with Charteris soon for his days might be numbered, although he lived for almost twenty more years. Reform Club December 2nd, 1935 Written on the 130th anniversary of the battle of Austerlitz . Thank you for counsel in my new distress: Yes, that is indeed the cause of giddiness, Liver and circulation. Circulation Much more than liver, in my situation. My liver, though I've drunk for 50 years Of Port, Rum, Brandy, Gin, and Human tears, In quantities above all other men, Only disturbs my balance now and then. But circulation's hellish in old age. Now it goes roaring in a spuming rage Like any Alpine torrent. Now it jumps And then goes jug jug like a set of pumps. Sometimes the blood all settles in my brain So that I cannot get to sleep again. (And commonly at four or five a.m.). At other times—and now I'm used to them— It leaves my brain without a warning said And leaves me drooping and 3/4 dead, Half-animate: of which it's no misnomer To say it may be called a State of Coma. There is no way out: not even wealth can bring The equilibrium of life's early spring. No incantations, no, nor pious prayers Restore the even current of affairs. Was ever thus. No further shall I strive. I do not even want to keep alive. (pp. 252-253) Possibly too much may be made of this kind of analysis, but it must be remembered that the verses in the Letters were for the eyes of the recipients of Belloc's letters and not for the general public. Insofar as it is possible for any writer to do so, Belloc was not creating a persona, he was writing as Belloc himself. 9</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Chronology of Sylvia Plath's Poems: 1956-1959 by Nancy D. Hargrove</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his Introduction to The Collected Poems of Sylvia Plath , Ted Hughes states that the "aim of the present complete edition . . . is to bring Sylvia Plath's poetry together in one volume . . . and to set everything in as true a chronological order as is possible , so that the whole progress and achievement of this unusual poet will become accessible to readers" (15; italics mine). Most reviewers and scholars have never questioned that order, assuming that it is largely or even wholly accurate. Comments such as the following are representative: "Chronologically arranged, her 224 adult poems make a kind of diary of artistic self-discovery . . ." (Pollitt 69), and "[We] are at last given a thoroughly responsible presentation of the poems in chronological order . . ." (Pritchard 72). However, while the order of the poems written from 1960 onward is reliable, thanks to Plath's own careful and consistent dating of those manuscripts, that for the poems composed from 1956 through 1959 is seriously flawed. Indeed, Hughes himself later in the Introduction clearly states that, for the poems of this period, he makes " approximations of order" only, based either on his memory or on dates of submissions to magazines. Thus, he goes on to note, "the sequence of the groups of poems through this period is fairly certain. But I am rarely sure now which poem comes before which in any particular group" (16-17; italics mine). Still, despite this caveat, the order which he established has never been challenged, although even the most casual reading of these poems in conjunction with the letters and journals or, in some instances, with simply a general knowledge of Plath's life reveals some obvious errors and raises suspicions that others might exist. In fact, they do. Since a valid assessment of Plath's development as a poet and of the worth of her work as a whole is partially dependent on an accurate chronology, it seems to me imperative to point out and correct as many of these errors as possible and to begin to establish a more nearly definitive order of composition. This is no easy task, and embarking upon it gives one a certain amount of sympathy for the difficulties Hughes himself faced. There is simply no hard evidence at all for a number of these poems, so that placing them was and still is largely a matter of informed speculation. However, such evidence does exist for many, revealing numerous errors in Hughes's dating. The chronology of Plath's life in itself indicates some errors so blatant that they seem to be the results of mere carelessness or extremely poor memory; for example, "Southern Sunrise" appears early in the 1956 section, implying a composition date in the winter or early spring although it could not possibly have been written before July of that year when Plath and Hughes vacationed in Benidorm. References to composition dates in journal entries, letters, and several unpublished sources bring to light other, less obvious mistakes. For example, three of the eight art poems composed during Spring Break in 1958, as indicated in both letters and journal entries for the week of March 20 that year, are inexplicably placed in the 1957 section, while "Landowners" is included in the 1956 section despite Plath's reference in a journal entry for July 3, 1958, to having just completed a poem on landowners (244), an error in dating of two years. Even had Hughes's memory failed him in such cases, both published letters and journal entries of this period clearly establish times of composition for many poems. Further, a most unlikely and unassuming source, located in the Plath Collection at Indiana University's Lilly Library, clearly establishes the exact dates of composition for thirty-six poems in 1956, drastically altering the established chronology for that year. Two tiny datebooks, The Cambridge Pocket Diary for 1955-56 (with entries beginning on October 1, 1955) and one for 1956-57 (with entries concluding at the end of November 1956), contain Plath's handwritten records of the events of most days, typically following a set formula beginning with a (usually gloomy) characterization of the day as a whole, describing the main happenings, and noting the specific dishes eaten at meals, particularly dinner. Among the happenings, she often notes the composition of poems by title or first line. Hughes must have overlooked these datebooks as a possible source for establishing the chronology, even though they were in the Lilly Library at the time that he was preparing the volume, having been among the materials purchased from Plath's mother Aurelia Schober Plath in March 1977. The Cambridge Manuscript, a collection of forty-three poems submitted by Plath in partial fulfillment of the Cambridge Tripos in the late spring of 1957, is another aid in determining poems produced in 1956 and early 1957 (Lane and Stevens 56-57). Other sources located in the Plath Collections of the Lilly Library at Indiana University and of the Smith College Library Rare Book Room that are helpful in dating the poems composed during all four years include portions of letters and journal entries omitted from the published versions, unpublished material by Mrs. Plath and Hughes, and Plath's list of submissions for the fall of 1959. Using all the evidence currently available, both published and unpublished, I will propose a reordered chronology for each of the four years in question, indicating those dates which are now definitive (along with the specific sources) as well as those still in question. In addition to Plath's letters and journals, the two Cambridge Pocket Diaries and the Cambridge Manuscript provide information that greatly contributes to the establishment of a more nearly accurate chronology for 1956. The Pocket Diary for 1955-56, containing entries that begin on October 1, 1955, with Plath's arrival in Cambridge and end in early October, 1956, and the Pocket Diary for 1956-57, with entries for the rest of 1956, give precise dates of composition for thirty-six poems, five of which have not 1956 Hughes's Chronology Reordered Chronology "Conversation Among the Ruins" Feb. 20 "Winter Landscape, with Rooks" "Winter Landscape, with Rooks" "Tale of a Tub" "Pursuit" 23 "Channel Crossing" "Bucolics" 27 "Pursuit" "Tale of a Tub" Winter?

The Cambridge Manuscript is helpful in establishing composition dates prior to the spring of 1957 for many works; while eleven appear to have been written prior to 1956, twenty-eight seem the products of that year and four of the early months of 1957. The first poem to be recorded in The Cambridge Pocket Diary for 1955-56 is "Winter Landscape, with Rooks." Written on February 20, 1956, according to entries both in the Pocket Diary and in her journal, it appears to be the earliest poem of this year. As she notes in the journal, "Wrote one good poem: 'Winter Landscape with Rocks' [sic]; it moves, and is athletic: a psychic landscape" (104). Here she combines two elements of her current personal life, her immediate environment of Cambridge (J 105) and her disillusionment with Richard Sassoon (J 98-105). 1 The next two poems, however, reflect her determination at this time to shift from private to social or universal concerns (LH 248). She describes "Tale of a Tub" in the February 20 journal entry: "Began another big [poem], more abstract, written from the bathtub: take care it doesn't get too general" (105). Clearly philosophical, the poem is a meditation on the illusions created by the imagination to veil the horrors of reality. Three days later, she notes in the Pocket Diary that she finished "Channel Crossing," calling it the best she has ever written. Basing it on her actual experience of crossing the English Channel for Christmas Holidays just two months earlier, she tells her mother that it is an attempt to bring "the larger, social world of other people into my poems" (LH 248). Although there is no clue as to the date of "Prospect," I suspect that it belongs to this time period, reflecting the view from Plath's Whitstead window and focusing on a landscape suggesting the hostility of the universe. None of these poems appear in the Cambridge Manuscript. Plath's resolve to focus on the "larger, social world" was shattered by the entrance of Hughes into her life, for the poems which she produced from two days after their first meeting through the end of May are concerned almost exclusively with love and passion. On Monday, February 27, she records both in her Pocket Diary and in her journal the composition of "Pursuit": "Wrote a full-page poem about the dark forces of lust: 'Pursuit.' It is not bad. It is dedicated to Ted Hughes" (J 115). While there seem to have been no poems written during March as she sorted out her feelings for Sassoon and Hughes, poems came quickly once the courtship with Hughes was fully underway in mid-April. On April 18, she notes in the Pocket Diary the composition of "Metamorphosis," later retitled "Faun," commenting that it is about Hughes as Pan and judging it to be good; the next day, she sent a copy of it to her mother, describing it as "a small [poem] about one night we went into the moonlight to find owls" (LH 264). In the same entry she also remarks that she has begun "Mad Queen's Song," retitled "The Complaint of the Crazed Queen" and later "The Queen's Complaint." Two days later (April 20), she indicates that she has completed "Through fen and farmland walking" and has begun what she calls her best yet, "Poem for Pan: Under crunch of my man's boot." On April 21, she not only mailed both to her mother, the former now titled "Song" (later retitled "Song for a Summer's Day") and the latter "Ode for Ted" (LH 266-267), but also began "Firesong," which she finished the next day, according to the Pocket Diary. The diary also reveals that on April 27 she composed "The Glutton," which she characterizes as brief, concrete, and rich; on April 29 she wrote "Strumpet Song" at 6 a.m. upon awaking in a melancholy mood; on May 5 she produced "Bucolics," no doubt inspired by the lovemaking session in a meadow noted the previous day; and on May 17 and 18 she worked on "Wreath for a Bridal." On the morning of May 24, according to the diary, she wrote "Two Sisters of Persephone," which in her opinion replaces "Ode for Ted" as her best poem; its theme reflects the debate over the intellectual versus the sexual which obsessed Plath particularly during the springtime courtship with Hughes. Concerns with the disruptive nature of passion in two other poems for which no evidence has yet been found by which to determine exact times of composition suggest that they may have been written in the spring. In "Conversation among the Ruins" Hughes seems the model for the male lover whose appearance has shattered the ordered life of the female speaker. Not only does the last line ("What ceremony of words can patch the havoc?") echo a line from his poetry, but also details associated with the lover are echoed in letters and journal entries describing Hughes written between late February and late April. Further, in a note addressed to Sassoon on April 18, Plath describes what appears to be her relationship with Hughes, using not only the same words employed in letters about Hughes written to her mother on April 17 and 19 ("Something very terrifying too has happened to me, which started two months ago," J 143), but also a variation of Hughes's line which concludes the poem: "I am living now in a kind of present hell and god knows what ceremonies of life or love can patch the havoc wrought" (J 143). Finally, Hughes notes that Plath had a postcard of the de Chirico painting which inspired the poem pinned to her door (CP 275); since she had a habit of purchasing postcards on her travels and displaying them in her room, it is plausible to suppose that she had obtained it during her trip to Italy in early April. Another possibility, reinforced in that the poem does not appear in the Cambridge Manuscript, is that it was written in 1958, when the works of de Chirico and other artists became an important source of subject matter. Because the second poem, "Recantation," is included in the Manuscript, it was written prior to the late spring of 1957, with the spring of 1956 as the most likely period since its content reflects Plath's own conflicts at this time about relinquishing a promising academic career for love and thereby disappointing older authority figures such as her mother and respected teachers both at Smith and Cambridge. The speaker of the poem, originally entitled "The Dying Witch Addresses her Young Apprentice" (Plath Collection, Smith College), admits the power of physical attraction over both wealth and wisdom, bitterly ordering her young charge to go to her "greenhorn youth." Through the first week of June, Plath continued to produce poems which she recorded in the Pocket Diary. She spent the morning of June 1 writing "Dream with Clam-Diggers." Set in the seaside town of Winthrop and reflecting an actual dream which she had on March 10 (J 133), it treats the impossibility of recapturing the innocence of childhood. Since it is a departure, both in setting and subject, from the poems that she composed throughout the spring, it is quite possible that Hughes suggested this topic to her, a regular practice from this point on designed to help Plath find sources of inspiration. Indeed, "Ella Mason and Her Eleven Cats," whose composition she noted the next day, was the result of an assignment given to her by Hughes (LH 359). Another comment on the negative results of spinsterhood, it again reflects Plath's struggle with the decision to remain single, but risk loneliness and social criticism, or to marry, but risk subjugation of her pride and freedom. On June 3, she worked the entire morning, producing 24 lines of "Gerd the Gypsy Crystal Gazer," later retitled simply "Crystal Gazer." Notable only for its mediocrity, the poem uses for its framework the dramatic situation of a newly-wedded couple consulting a fortune-teller about their future to convey the typical Plathian theme that love ultimately is painful and ends in decay and death. Finishing the revisions of "Crystal Gazer" on the 5th, she wrote "Tinker Jack Traffics with the Tidy Wives" (retitled "Tinker Jack and the Tidy Wives") on the 7th. Thoroughly conventional in its theme of the transience of youth and beauty and in its ballad-like form with archaic and stilted diction, it is unusual in its use of a male speaker. The next two poems, "The Village Idiot who Watched the Weather" and "The Spiteful Crone," written on June 8 and 21 respectively, are apparently no longer in existence; she perhaps destroyed them, having labelled the second a bad poem. She broke out of this spate of particularly weak poems with "Miss Drake Proceeds to Supper," a sensitive presentation of the experience of a mental patient suffering paranoia based on her memory of such a woman at McLean in 1953 (see BJ 157-159). Although Hughes asserts that he remembers precisely Plath's writing it "on a parapet over the Seine on 21 June, 1956" (CP 17), not only does Plath's letter of June 18 to Warren indicate that they would not arrive in Paris until June 22, but also an entry for June 23 in the Pocket Diary notes both the composition of the poem and the drawing of a pair of shoes on that day. On July 3, she wrote "The Shrike," a bizarre and violent poem about a young bride who is so jealous of her husband's glamorous dreams during the night that, like the butcherbird (the bird's common name), she viciously attacks him each morning. An unpublished section of her journals, which appears to have been written during the train trip to Spain on July 5-6, contains a fragment from "The Shrike" with several alterations, suggesting that she worked on it for the next several days (Plath Collection, Smith College). Of the nineteen poems whose dates of composition she records in the Pocket Diary from the time that she met Hughes until the end of June, only six do not appear in the Cambridge Manuscript: "Ode For Ted," "Song for a Summer's Day," "Firesong," "Bucolics," "The Village Idiot," and "The Spiteful Crone." That "Conversation Among the Ruins," whose composition is not noted in the Pocket Diary, is not in the Manuscript either is further evidence that it may well have been written much later. From July 7 until August 20, Plath and Hughes vacationed in Spain; although Plath records many details in the Pocket Diary, so that their movements and activities are easy to trace, she only notes the composition of two poems ("Full Moon" and "Epitaph for Fire and Flower"). That none of the ten poems based on her experiences in Spain appears here or in the Cambridge Manuscript raises the possibility that all were composed after the spring of 1957; indeed, several journal entries indicate that, in the summer of 1958 and in the winter of 1959, she turned to her memories of this period as sources of inspiration. In an entry for July 27, 1958, she notes, "I've written two [poems] about Benidorm, which was closed to me as a poem subject till now" (253), and in one for January 28, 1959, she writes, "Sudden desire to do a series of Cambridge and Benidorm poems" (294). Despite the 1958 entry, Hughes has placed none of the "Spanish" poems in the 1958 section of The Collected Poems . Seven appear in the 1956 section ("Southern Sunrise," "Alicante Lullaby," "Fiesta Melons," "The Goring," "The Beggars," "Spider," and "Departure"), one in the 1957 section ('The Other Two"), and two in the 1959 section ("Two Views of a Cadaver Room" and "The Net-Menders"). Clearly, placing these poems is extremely difficult and involves a good deal of speculation. However, I suggest that only "Southern Sunrise," "Alicante Lullaby," "Fiesta Melons," "The Other Two," and perhaps "The Goring" can be considered as possible products of the summer or fall of 1956 (and of course all may have been written a good bit later), the first four because of the light-hearted, essentially positive tone of each, a rarity in Plath's poetry perhaps reflecting the happiness of this honeymoon period, and the last because she may have written it in conjunction with a short story on the bullfight that she and Hughes saw in Madrid between July 7 and 10; in letters of July 14 and 25, she tells her mother that she is writing a bullfight story (LH 299, 302), whose specific details, as recounted here, correspond to those in the poem. And at the bottom of a typescript of the poem in the Smith College Plath Collection the date 1956 is written in blue ink, although the handwriting cannot be definitely identified. However, it is also possible that the poem was written in the early summer of 1958, for her comment in a journal entry for July 9, 1958, that a poem she had written that day is "Hard as my little gored picador poem was hard" (248) may imply that "The Goring" had been composed recently; in addition, it is written in the strict syllabics (fifteen per line, in this instance) with which Plath was extensively experimenting during the summer of 1958. The remaining Spanish poems seem almost certainly to have been written in the summer of 1958 or the early months of 1959. A reference to "the black spider in Spain knotting ants around its rock" (243) in a journal entry for June 26, 1958 may indicate that "Spider" was begun or at least conceived at about this time, especially since Plath was then focusing on animals as subjects. As for the two poems on Benidorm written between July 17 and 27, according to the journal entry of the latter date (253), "Spider" and "Departure" seem the most likely candidates, for both exhibit challenging syllabic patterns: 12-7-6-10-8-7-12 in "Spider" and 11-9-7-5 in "Departure," a clever technical echo of the theme of departure. Of course, these two might be among the results of her "Sudden desire to do a series of Cambridge and Benidorm poems" (J 294) early in 1959; however, "The Net-Menders" with a count of 13 syllables per line and "The Beggars" (originally entitled "The Beggars of Benidorm Market") with a syllabic pattern of 9-8-9 are more plausible products of this period since they appear consistently in Plath's list of submissions for the fall of 1959 (Plath Collection, Smith College). Finally, "Two Views of a Cadaver Room," while not strictly speaking a "Benidorm" poem, was perhaps an offshoot of the memories of Spain evoked in early 1959 while composing those poems, for an entry in the Pocket Diary for July 10, 1956, reveals that she and Hughes saw paintings by Bosch, Granach, and several Flemish painters in the Prado before departing for Alicante later in the day. It seems certain that among them was Breughel's The Triumph of Death , on which part two of the poem is based. The only two poems definitely composed during the Spanish vacation, according to the Pocket Diary, are "Full Moon," a work written on August 4 which Plath characterized as bad and therefore apparently destroyed, and "Epitaph for Fire and Flower," begun on August 18 and completed the next day (see also LH 313-315). Against the enormous backdrop of the universe, the latter comments on the intensity and the transience of sexual passion, focusing on "two most perishable lovers." Leaving Benidorm on August 21, the two spent a week in Paris followed by a month (August 29-October 1) in Heptonstall, West Yorkshire, with Hughes's parents. During this time, Plath only mentions four poems in her Pocket Diary. On September 5, she notes that she worked on "Firesong," which she had first written on April 21, and "Golden Midas," which has not survived. On September 9, she records the composition of "November Graveyard," which Hughes has placed next to last in the 1956 section. The first of a number of poems inspired by the scenery of West Yorkshire, it focuses on the highly unusual graveyard of Heptonstall's ruined church of St. Thomas à Becket to convey its theme of the absolute finality and nothingness of death, despite the imagination's attempts to create the illusion of an afterlife. The composition of the first draft of another poem which has not survived, "Obstacle Course," is recorded on September 16. Returning alone to Cambridge on October 1 to begin her second year of study, Plath immediately produced two poems reflecting her anguish over the separation from Hughes, both of which are noted in the Pocket Diary: "Monologue at 3 a.m." on October 3 and "Street Song" on October 4. After recording the composition of the second, in which a protagonist suffering intense emotional pain does her shopping on a busy street, she comments that she misses Hughes greatly. On October 5, her last entry to mention a poem in the Pocket Diary for 1955-56, she notes the composition of "Touch and Go"; on the subject of statues, it appears in the Cambridge Manuscript, but not in The Collected Poems . Switching to The Cambridge Pocket Diary 1956-1957 , she records the composition of seven more poems along with other daily events through November. She spent the morning of October 19 writing "Spinster." A portrayal of a woman who retreats from the emotional chaos and intensity of passion, it seems clearly to reflect the influence of Hughes's "Secretary." Although Hughes has placed "On the Plethora of Dryads" in the 1957 section, according to the Pocket Diary she began it on October 24, 1956, completing it two days later. A highly stilted poem, it presents the conflict between the abstract and the concrete, between the purity of the intellect and the corruption of the flesh, with the latter winning out. Its echoes of Stevens in both subject and style can be seen in other poems of the fall such as "November Graveyard" and "Black Rook in Rainy Weather." With its similar title and its reflections of Stevens, "On the Difficulty of Conjuring up a Dryad" may also have been composed at this time, for the date 1956 appears in ink at the end of page 2 in a typescript in the Smith College Plath Collection, and the poem appears in the Cambridge Manuscript. Further, it was published in the Winter 1956-57 issue of Chequer (Lane and Stevens 29). In an unpublished letter of April 1, 1957, Plath tells her mother that it has been bought by Poetry and describes it as a philosophical poem on the death of the imagination (Plath Collection, Lilly Library). The first draft of "Vanity Fair" is noted on October 28; using as her central character a witch who tempts innocent girls to indulge in sex, Plath portrays sexual passion as consuming, violent, and destructive. In mid-November the Pocket Diary records the composition of four poems in six days. Turning to the more philosophical and abstract subject of the ability of the natural world to provide rare moments of inspiration or significance, she worked throughout the morning of November 17 on "Black Rook in Rainy Weather," another poem in the manner of Stevens. The next day, after revising it, she composed "Soliloquy of the Solipsist"; inspired no doubt by Hughes's "Soliloquy of a Misanthrope," it focuses on the ability of the artist/lover's imagination to create and to destroy. And the following day saw the composition of "Letter to a Purist," a stylistically awkward poem in which the female speaker denigrates the purist element in her lover. The last notation in the Pocket Diary of the composition of a poem appears on November 23 for "Monarch Mind," later retitled "Natural History." Hughes's placement of it in the 1957 section is thus in error. In a stilted and thoroughly conventional allegorical mode, it treats the defeat of the intellect by the body. The order of composition for the poems produced in the fall of 1956, as confirmed by the Pocket Diaries, shows Plath alternating between works based on highly personal, current concerns with love, sex, and physical separation emanating from her relationship with Hughes (but always carefully distanced and objectified, in accordance with the poetic dictates of the time) and more abstract meditations on such topics as the interaction between the imagination and reality or the conflict between the intellectual and the physical. Finally, four poems which Hughes has placed in the 1956 section may belong to the fall of that year, although little evidence has yet been found to aid in their placement. "Dialogue between Ghost and Priest," on the theme that the pain of love extends beyond life and into death, may have been written soon after the West Yorkshire visit of September when Plath was first introduced to the region's folk tales of fantasy and the supernatural (see J 149), while the situation (a student's determination to overcome depression and fear) and the concrete details in "Resolve," which appears in the Cambridge Manuscript, suggest that it may have been written in November or December of 1956. The coal fire, the hedge leaves, and the neighbor's rose bush reflect the flat at 55 Eltisley Avenue, which Hughes occupied beginning on November 1 (LH 324). According to Stevenson, Plath joined him in mid-November, although she retained her Whitstead room until December 1 (98). Further, the references to a "Day of mist" and to the "little hedge leaves" having turned yellow evoke the season of autumn. Its publication in Granta on March 9, 1957 (Lane and Stevens 31), also suggests the late fall as a plausible time of composition. "Rhyme" is puzzling in the extreme, offering few clues to its time of composition. Its use of allegory and its apparent theme that an artistic imagination that does not produce should be destroyed, similarities to other poems produced in the fall, would indicate that time period as a possibility. However, that it is not in the Cambridge Manuscript may suggest a later time of composition, perhaps the summer of 1958 because of its theme and its experimentation with a rather elaborate syllabic pattern. "Maudlin," a highly enigmatic poem in the surrealist mode, is included in the Cambridge Manuscript with the title "Mad Maudlin"; therefore, a fall 1956 composition date is entirely plausible. 2 The poems for 1957 are the most problematical of the four years in question, for hard evidence of times of composition exists for only five; placing the others, then, is largely a matter of speculation, and some of them may not even belong to 1957. Of the twenty-one poems that Hughes has included in the 1957 section of The Collected Poems , five definitely were composed in other years ("On the Plethora of Dryads" and "Natural History" in 1956 and "The Disquieting Muses," "On the Decline of Oracles," and "Snakecharmer" in 1958) and three may well have been ("On the Difficulty of Conjuring up a Dryad" and "The Other Two" in 1956 and "Words for a Nursery" in 1959). In an unpublished passage of a letter of January 14, 1957, Plath tells her mother that she has just written two long poems of approximately fifty lines each and feels much better for having broken the dry spell of the previous few months, occasioned by her numerous practical problems (Plath Collection, 1957 Hughes's Chronology Reordered Chronology "The Snowman on the Moor" by Jan. 14 "Sow" "Mayflower" "The Snowman on the Moor" "Sow" Jan. 21 "Mayflower" "The Everlasting Monday" by Feb. 3 "The Lady and the Earthenware Head" "Hardcastle Crags" Apr. 7 "All the Dead Dears" "The Thin People" Aug. ? "Ouija" "On the Difficulty of Conjuring up a Dryad" "Words for a Nursery" "On the Plethora of Dryads" Summer? "Two Views of Withens" "The Other Two" "The Great Carbuncle" "The Lady and the Earthenware Head" "Hardcastle Crags" "All the Dead Dears" Late '57/Early '58? "A Lesson in Vengeance" "Natural History" "The Everlasting Monday" "Two Views of Withens" "The Thin People" "The Great Carbuncle" "Night Shift" "Words for a Nursery" "The Disquieting Muses" "Night Shift" "Ouija" "On the Decline of Oracles" "Snakecharmer" "A Lesson in Vengeance" Lilly Library); the two referred to are "The Snowman on the Moor" and "Sow." A letter of February 3 alludes to the latter, "I am very happy and alive and writing better poems—a big one about a Sow, about 45 lines" (LH 335). Further, an unpublished letter of April 1 which announces the acceptance of the two (along with "Ella Mason" and "On the Difficulty of Conjuring up a Dryad") by Poetry describes "Sow" as a long poem about an enormous pig and "The Snowman on the Moor" as a poem of fifty lines about a woman running to the moors after a fight with a man and seeing a vision; she feels that they are among her best (Plath Collection, Lilly Library). Both were inspired by earlier experiences in Heptonstall, "Sow" by a huge pig she and Hughes had seen on a neighbor's farm on September 7, 1956, according to The Cambridge Pocket Diary for 1955-56, and "Snowman" by an apparent argument during their Christmas visit (see J 149). In an unpublished letter of January 21, 1957 to Mrs. Plath and Warren, Hughes notes that Plath has recently completed one or two very good poems, a reference no doubt to "Sow" and "Snowman"; he goes on to say that she has written "Mayflower" that day for a poetry competition with a prize of fifteen pounds sponsored by one of the Oxford colleges (Plath Collection, Lilly Library). A typescript of the poem in the Smith College Plath Collection bears a notation at the top in pen referring to the Hamilton Prize of Oriel College, Oxford. This highly conventional sonnet concerns the significance of the name of the pilgrims' ship. Plath must also have produced "The Lady and the Earthenware Head" during mid to late January, for she mentions it to her mother in a letter of February 3, commenting that it has "the best verse I've ever written" (LH 335). She includes a copy of the poem along with a lengthy explanation in her letter of February 8 (LH 336-339). While awkward and loose, with stilted and excessive diction, it is interesting psychologically in its suggestion that one's negative side (symbolized by the model head) can never be successfully destroyed; it was her choice as "the right title, the only title" (J 193) for her volume of poems from February to April of 1958 (CP 13). Plath is exaggerating only slightly when she tells her mother in a letter of August 6 that she is "writing my first poem for about six months" (LH 372), for she seems to have produced little from February through July under the various pressures of studying for her exams ("I am living at the University library from morning to night," she says in late April, LH 355), cooking and keeping house, and returning to the United States in late June. Only one poem can definitely be attributed to this period; in a letter of April 8, Plath tells her mother, "I just finished yesterday one of my best, about 56 lines, called 'All the Dead Dears'" (LH 352). Based on an exhibit that she had seen at the Archaeological Museum on Downing Street in Cambridge, the poem presents death as a sinister, hovering presence in the form of one's own dead relatives, who wait greedily and impatiently to drag the living into the grave with them. With the exception of "Mayflower," these poems from early 1957 are included in the Cambridge Manuscript. The remaining poems cannot be placed with any certainty, although the fact that none appear in the Cambridge Manuscript suggests that they were written after May 1957; some may have been produced in the late summer before her job as instructor of English at Smith College absorbed all her attention, leaving her little time or energy for creative writing in the fall, while others may have come during the next year. The poem to which she refers in the August 6 letter, described as "a short verse dialogue . . . over a Ouija board, which is both dramatic and philosophical" (LH 372-373), must be "Dialogue over a Ouija Board," which grew to be much longer than she had originally planned. Perhaps because of its length, Hughes put it in the notes for the 1957 section of The Collected Poems (276-286) rather than in the section itself. However, he does place the short poem "Ouija" in the section proper. While the latter was perhaps written earlier in the year since Hughes and Plath had been consulting a spirit in the Ouija board since February (see LH 337), it seems more plausible that it emerged in August as an off-shoot of the longer work; indeed, a journal entry for August 9 indicates that Plath may have tired of the "long lumbering dialogue verse poem" (170) and abandoned it for this shorter version on the same subject. A highly ambiguous poem, it portrays Pan, the spirit of the Ouija board, as a worn-out, ineffective, and basically powerless god associated with death more than life, evil more than good, weakness more than strength. "Words for a Nursery," spoken by the right hand of a foetus or an infant (Aurelia Plath's notes on the poem, Plath Collection, Smith College), may also have been written in August when Plath feared she was pregnant; however, she notes that "I couldn't write a word about it" (J 171), and it seems unlikely that such a whimsical tone could have come from this "black lethal" period (J 171). A more plausible time of composition would be the fall of 1959, when Plath actually was pregnant. Support for this contention lies in that its original title "Poem for a Nursery" echoes "Poem for a Birthday," and both its style and its unusual speaker are typical of that and other poems produced then. "Two Views of Withens," "The Great Carbuncle," and "Hardcastle Crags," all based on the scenery of West Yorkshire, may have been inspired by the June visit to West Yorkshire before setting sail for the States and written later in the summer, but their time of composition cannot be ascertained. The first recounts the differing responses of two hikers to the ruined farmhouse which was the model for Bronte's Wuthering Heights (see CP 276); although Plath first visited the site in September of 1956 (LH 306), she may well have returned during the June visit of 1957. The second, an Eliotean meditation on a moment out of time caused by "an odd phenomenon sometimes observed on high moorland for half an hour or so at evening, when the hands and faces of people seem to become luminous" (CP 276), is perhaps based on an actual occasion in September 1956 when the horizontal light of the setting sun turned Hughes and Plath a glowing pink as they hiked on the moors (unpublished portion of letter written on September 11, 1956, Plath Collection, Lilly Library). Finally, "Hardcastle Crags," whose earlier titles include "Night Walk," "A Walk in the Night," and "Nocturne" (Plath Collection, Lilly Library), uses Heptonstall and the surrounding moorland as symbols of the harsh indifference both of humanity and nature to the lonely, frail, and vulnerable individual. There are only a few vague, ambiguous clues to the times of composition of the four remaining poems, which seem to have been written in the fall of 1957 or the winter of 1958. "A Lesson in Vengeance," a stilted allegory, was completed by February 28, 1958, as an unpublished portion of a journal entry notes that it was sent out to an unnamed magazine on that date (Plath Collection, Smith College). Likewise, "The Everlasting Monday" was written prior to April 26, 1958, since in an unpublished journal entry for that day Plath proposes "The Everlasting Monday" as the current title for her book of poetry, explaining that it captures Yeats's concept of work and life as composed of everlasting Mondays, a symbol of new beginnings (Plath Collection, Smith College). "The Thin People," originally entitled "The Moon was a Fat Woman Once," seems to have been written between September 1957 and the late spring of 1958 when she read it during a recording session. A brilliant poem on how the knowledge of the suffering and injustice of the world, as represented by starving peoples, haunts and tortures sensitive and thus vulnerable individuals, its "wallpaper / Frieze of cabbage-roses and cornflowers" no doubt reflects the "pink-rose-walled room" (J 183) of the Northampton apartment in which Plath and Hughes lived during her tenure as an instructor at Smith. "Night Shift," which focuses on the harsh reality of the mechanized industrial world observed in a factory on Northampton's Main Street, also appears to be a product of this academic year, though not necessarily of the fall of 1957. While Hughes includes it in the 1957 section, a brief allusion in a journal entry for July 17, 1958, to a possible source for the situation described in the poem may indicate a composition date of mid to late 1958: "The windows shake in their sockets from some unheard detonation" (250). 1958 Hughes's Chronology Reordered Chronology "Virgin in a Tree" Mar. 20 "Virgin in a Tree" "Perseus" "Perseus" "Battle-Scene" 21 "Battle-Scene" "Yadwigha" "The Ghost's Leavetaking" "A Winter's Tale" 22-27 "The Disquieting Muses" "Above the Oxbow" "On the Decline of Oracles" "Memoirs of a Spinach-Picker" "Snakecharmer" "The Ghost's Leavetaking" "Yadwigha" "Sculptor" May 22-June 11 "Full Fathom Five" "Full Fathom Five" "Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor" "Lorelei" "Child's Park Stones" "Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor" by June 25 "Fable of the Rhododendron Stealers" "Moonrise" "Above the Oxbow" "Frog Autumn" June 26 "Owl" "In Midas' Country" June/Early July?

"The Companionable Ills" "I Want, I Want" "Poems, Potatoes" "The Death of Myth-Making" "The Times are Tidy" Late Dec. "A Winter's Tale" The order of composition for the 1958 poems can be more firmly established than that for the previous year because of copious references in journal entries and letters as well as in unpublished materials of several types. The eight art poems composed during the week of spring holidays (March 20-27) appear to be the earliest products of 1958. In January Plath received a letter from ART news requesting "a poem on art" (J 189; LH 385). Based on the knowledge gained from the modern art course she was auditing at Smith and further investigation on her own in the art library during February and early March, she narrowed her subjects down to works by Klee, Rousseau, and de Chirico. 3 When the holidays finally provided her with some free time, she burst into "a frenzy" of writing. In a letter of March 22, she tells her mother that she completed "Virgin in a Tree," "Perseus," "Battle-Scene," and "The Ghost's Leavetaking," all on works by Klee, on the 20th and 21st, as well as "a little lyric on a cat with a bird-stigma between its eyebrows," which has disappeared (LH 386). Further, she indicates in a journal entry for March 28 that "The Disquieting Muses," "On the Decline of Oracles," "Snakecharmer," and "Yadwigha," on works by de Chirico and Rousseau, were written between March 22 and 27: "I wrote eight poems in the last eight days, long poems, lyrical poems, and thunderous poems. . . . I have written two poems on paintings by De Chirico which seize my imagination—'The Disquieting Muses' and 'On the Decline of Oracles' (after his early painting, The Enigma of the Oracle ) and two on paintings by Rousseau—a green and moony mood-piece, 'Snakecharmer,' and my last poem of the eight, . . . a sestina on Yadwigha, 'The Dream'" (210-211). Despite this evidence, Hughes has inexplicably placed "The Disquieting Muses," "On the Decline of Oracles," and "Snakecharmer" in the 1957 section. Plath's intense interest in art at this time also raises the possibility that "Conversation Among the Ruins," based on a painting of that title by de Chirico, may belong here rather than to 1956. With the exception of "The Disquieting Muses," the use of art works allows Plath to present some of her most pressing personal and artistic concerns in a distanced, objective manner: the destructive nature of chastity in "Virgin in a Tree," the triumph over anguish and suffering in "Perseus," the human desire to accomplish heroic feats in "Battle-Scene," the vitality of the dream world in contrast to the dullness of the daily world in "The Ghost's Leavetaking," the conflict between idealistic and painfully realistic concepts of life in "The Disquieting Muses," the loss of significant prophetic vision in the modern artist/poet in "On the Decline of Oracles," the creative powers of the artist/poet in "Snakecharmer," and the freedom of the artistic imagination in "Yadwigha." Plath's hectic schedule of teaching, grading papers, and keeping house apparently left no time for her to write from late March until her classes ended on May 22. However, once free, she turned immediately to poetry, producing "Full Fathom Five," "Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor," and "Child's Park Stones" by June 11. Beginning with these poems and continuing throughout the summer, she undertook extensive experiments with syllabics in an attempt to combine a strict form with "a speaking illusion of freedom" (LH 396-397), and, partially under Hughes's influence, she turned to her past and to the natural world as sources of subject matter. Journal entries for May 11 and June 11 provide convincing evidence of the time of composition of "Full Fathom Five." In the former she notes that Full Fathom Five is a potential title for her book of poems and discusses its multiple meanings; she then adds that, when she is free of her job, she will set herself "magic objects to write on: sea-bearded bodies—and begin thus, digging into the reaches of my deep submerged head, 'and it's old and old it's sad and old it's sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father . . .'—so Joyce says, so the river flows to the paternal source of godhead" (223). By June 11 she had written the poem: "My book is now titled after what I consider one of my best and curiously moving poems about my father-sea-dog-muse: Full Fathom Five " (J 244). Its syllabic pattern of 7-9-5, a rhythmic and visual recreation of the motion of waves and tides, is the first of numerous experiments with this technique during the summer; indeed, most of the poems produced then exhibit syllabics, another clue to dating. "Full Fathom Five" also reflects her current interest in modern art in that one of its several sources may have been Jackson Pollock's 1947 painting of the same title (Melander 38). In a letter of June 11 to her brother, Plath includes "a recent poem . . . I made about the fiddler crabs we found at Rock Harbor when we went to get mussels last summer for fish bait" (LH 396) as an example of her new realistic subject matter (nature) and style (syllabics), asking him to check her details for accuracy. "Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor," on the inability of the human being to understand or become a part of the animal world, was accepted by June 25 for publication in The New Yorker , an accomplishment which she had long desired, and appeared in the August 9 issue. Finally, her journal entry for June 11 indicates that "Child's Park Stones," a descriptive poem on the stability and tranquility of the enormous rocks in this park near their Northampton apartment, has just been completed: "We went at twilight to walk in the green park (I have just written a good syllabic poem, 'Child's Park Stones,' as juxtaposed to the ephemeral orange and fuchsia azaleas, and feel the park is my favorite place in America)" (236). The same journal entry also recounts an incident in the park which provided the inspiration for "Fable of the Rhododendron Stealers." It may well have been composed soon afterward, for, in an unpublished portion of a letter of June 25, Plath tells her mother that she has written another poem about the park (Plath Collection, Lilly Library), meaning apparently another one in addition to "Child's Park Stones." In the same unpublished portion of the letter, she also reveals that she has written a poem about climbing a mountain, a reference no doubt to "Above the Oxbow." A descriptive piece on the countryside surrounding the Oxbow of the Connecticut River as viewed from the small mountain of Skinner State Park, just south of Northampton, it has a highly elaborate syllabic pattern of 12-12-12-12-10-12-12-10-12-10-12-10-12-10. An unpublished journal entry for July 1 confirms that it had been composed prior to that date, for she notes that, upon climbing Mt. Holyoke with Ted, she was reassured that her descriptions in "Above the Oxbow" were accurate, referring to the line "leaf-shuttered escarpments" as an illustration (Plath Collection, Smith College). The next poem for which an exact date can be determined is "Owl," written on the morning of June 26, according to a journal entry of that date: "Wrote a brief poem this morning—'Owl over Main Street' in syllabic verse. . . . That owl we heard on our midnight walk around town, the great feathered underside of the bird's body, its wide wings spread over the telephone wires— a ghoulish skrwack" (243). In the poem, Plath uses the owl and the rat as symbols of the hidden and sinister destructiveness of the natural world. Another poem using an animal as subject and experimenting with syllabics may have been written in June or early July rather than in the summer of 1956; "The Goring," based on her memory of a bullfight seen in Madrid in July 1956, was written by July 9, for in a journal entry for that day she compares it to "Whiteness I Remember" (248). Several other poems, all but one of which use syllabics, are products of the first days of July. The unpublished July 1 entry referred to above goes on to record their unsuccessful attempt to approach a groundhog while climbing Mt. Holyoke, an incident that was to become the subject of "Incommunicado," a poem written by July 3, as indicated in an entry of that date: "Ted has given me several poetry subjects and assignments which are highly exciting: I've already written a good short poem on the groundhog and on landowners and am eager for others" (244). Further, in an unpublished portion of a letter of July 5, Plath recounts the same event to her mother, noting that she has written a short poem about it (Plath Collection, Lilly Library). With a syllabic pattern that is a variation of the one in "Above the Oxbow" (10-10-12-10-10-10-12), "Incommunicado" uses specific details from the actual episode to convey once again the impossibility of human beings establishing communication with animals. The reference to a poem on landowners in the July 3 entry indicates that "Landowners," which Hughes has placed in the 1956 section of The Collected Poems , actually belongs in 1958. The use of syllabics (9 per line) seems to confirm this later date. Further, Plath may well have combined her present envy of those who owned their property with a similar emotion experienced while a student at Cambridge to produce this psychological study of the speaker's envy of the stability and rootedness of landowners. This poem also heralds a new source of subject matter at this time, memories of the past, perhaps suggested to her by Hughes. This interest in the past combined with a directive from the Ouija board on July 3 to "write on the poem subject 'Lorelei' because they are my own kin" to inspire "Lorelei," which Plath wrote "for fun" on July 4, "remembering the plaintive German song Mother used to play and sing to us. . . . The subject appealed to me doubly (or triply): the German legend of the Rhine sirens, the sea-childhood symbol, and the death-wish involved in the song's beauty. The poem devoured my day, but I feel it is a book poem and am pleased with it" (J 245-246). An extraordinary expression of the attraction of suicide, despite its attendant terrors, the poem employs a pattern of seven syllables per line in which the extra, often unstressed syllable at the end impels the reader forward to the inevitable conclusion. Plath's delving into her past as a source of subject matter is also reflected in the July 5 letter: "I am going back to the ocean as my poetic heritage and hope to revisit all the places I remember in Winthrop with Ted this summer; Johnson Avenue, a certain meadow on it, our beach and grammy's. Even rundown as it now is, the town has the exciting appeal of my childhood, and I am writing some good poems about it, I think" (LH 398). One of these was surely "Green Rock, Winthrop Bay," a comment on the destructive effects of time and the impossibility of recapturing the innocence and beauty of the past; curiously, Plath abandons syllabics, perhaps to reflect the jarring, disturbing nature of the speaker's disillusionment. It seems likely that "Memoirs of a Spinach-Picker," based on her 1950 summer job at Lookout Farm (see J 3-5; LH 35-36) and originally entitled "The Champion Spinach Picker" (Plath Collection, Smith College), was produced at this time as well, a speculation supported by its use of syllabics (11 per line); it is unusual in its theme of the freshness and idealism of youth. From this time through mid July, Plath suffered from a bout of imaginative sterility that catapulted her into intense depression. This period of sterility, however, was followed by one of productivity: in a journal entry for July 27, she notes, "I have written four or five good poems this past ten days, after a sterile hysterical ten days of nonproduction. These poems are, I think, deeper, more sobre, somber (yet well colored) than any I've yet done" (253). Unfortunately, she does not identify those poems, and yet some clues allow a number of speculations. "Whiteness I Remember," a syllabic poem based on a memory from her Cambridge days, seems to have been her first attempt to break out of the dry spell. While an entry in The Journals ("I wrote what I consider a 'book poem' about my runaway ride in Cambridge on the horse Sam") indicates that she wrote it on or just prior to July 9 (248), in an unpublished portion of a journal entry for July 17, Plath notes that she started writing it on July 14 and must finish it that morning (Plath Collection, Smith College). Whether she began it on the 9th or the 14th, she still felt paralyzed by sterility on the 19th: "Paralysis still with me. It is as if my mind stopped" (J 251). In describing her inability to produce, she writes, "Lines occur to me and stop dead. . . . I observe: 'The mulberry berries redden under leaves.' And stop" (J 251); one page later in the midst of castigating herself the sentence "Grub-white mulberries redden under leaves" appears abruptly and without explanation (252). Clearly, she is struggling here with the poem which becomes "Moonrise"; ironically, she overcomes her imaginative sterility by writing a highly psychological, surrealistic poem about it. In addition to using syllabics (10 per line) and referring to Child's Park and the month of July, the poem fulfills the terms "sober," "sombre," and "well colored" which she uses in the July 27 journal entry to describe the poems she has just completed. As she notes in the July 27 entry, two of the poems which she has just written are "about Benidorm, which was closed to me as a poem subject till now. I think I am opening up new subjects and have . . . a plainer, realer poetry" (253). The most likely candidates, as discussed earlier, are "Spider" and "Departure," both of which are written in challenging syllabic patterns. Concerning the former, in a journal entry for June 26, she records her memory of "the black spider in Spain knotting ants around its rock" (243), indicating her interest in it as subject matter at this time. And the publication of "Departure" on March 7, 1959, in The Nation (Lane and Stevens 19) supports this period as its time of composition. Two incidents recorded in the July 17 entry, one published and the other unpublished, suggest that "Night Shift" and "Sculptor" may have been composed at this time. The former, a notation that "The windows shake in their sockets from some unheard detonation" (250), may record the situation which inspired "Night Shift," which currently appears in the 1957 section of The Collected Poems . The latter is a long, detailed description first of the bronze statues of dead men and then of the enormous wooden statue of a wingless angel in the house of Leonard Baskin, artist-in-residence at Smith College, whom Plath and Hughes first met on May 5, 1958; Plath then records her awe and admiration of his work (Plath Collection, Smith College). She may well have composed "Sculptor" soon after she made this entry; it was published in May 1959 in Grecourt Review (Lane and Stevens 31). Dedicated to Baskin, it is a tribute to the creative powers of the artist, the sacredness of his craft, the immortality of his works. That both poems follow similar syllabic patterns (7 per line and 7-7-7-8, respectively) is further evidence that they belong here. "In Midas' Country" and "Frog Autumn," both of which exhibit complex syllabic patterns, seem products of August, Plath's last poems on Northampton prior to the move to Boston in September. The former had its inception in copious notes dated August 9 which describe speed boats on the Connecticut River, skiers on invisible towlines, white wakes in blue water, and bleached heads of rye; at the end is written (apparently later) "In Midas' Country" (Plath Collection, Smith College). Set in the countryside near Northampton, the poem presents the late summer as a time of abundance and richness which will soon give way to the harsher conditions of winter. While there is no hard evidence, its similar subject matter, the decay and sterility of the natural world in autumn, suggests that the latter shares this time of composition; its scenery certainly seems to reflect the frog pond in Child's Park, where Plath and Hughes often watched "two magnificent black frogs" (LH 395); it was published in January 1959 in The Nation (Lane and Stevens 22). The next five poems, which Hughes has placed at the end of the 1958 section, may have been written in the fall in Boston, but they could also have come earlier in the year; "The Companionable Ills" and "The Times are Tidy" were published in January 1959 and "The Death of Myth-Making" and "I Want, I Want" in the fall of 1959 (Lane and Stevens). As a group, they show an abandonment of the use of nature and the (somewhat personal) past as subject matter in favor of allegory and vague abstractions. "The Companionable Ills," "I Want, I Want," and "Poems, Potatoes" continue the syllabic experimentation of the summer, while "The Death of Myth-Making" and "The Times are Tidy" do not. These poems seem remarkable only in their mediocrity, perhaps reflecting Plath's battle with the "old panic fear" (J 259) throughout the fall. As the result of taking a job in early October in the psychiatric clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital, suffering a severe depression which sent her back to her psychiatrist Beuscher, and concentrating on short stories when she did write, Plath seems to have produced no other poems until the end of December, composing "A Winter's Tale" after she, Hughes, and Mrs. Plath had taken a walk around Beacon Hill on Christmas Eve. In this "light piece" (LH 410) with a syllabic count of 8-8-8-4, she attacks the commercialization of Christmas through a catalogue of sights observed in Boston. As was the case with the poems of 1958, accurate composition dates can be established for many poems of 1959 as a result of numerous references in journal entries, letters, and other sources, and enough clues about others exist to allow speculation supported by some evidence. With goals of using actual people, situations, and emotions in place of the fictional ones of past works and of avoiding strict, highly formal structures which inhibit emotional intensity, Plath still wavered uncertainly over whether to write directly about herself during this year. She produced poetry in two three-month periods. In the first (January through March), she focused on locations associated with her past—Cambridge, Benidorm, and, most often, Winthrop and its environs—and only occasionally used the syllabics associated with the summer and fall of 1958. In the second (September through November), she found inspiration in Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, New York, where she and Hughes resided from September 9 to November 19. While she wrote in distanced tones and relied on syllabics and triplets in the first of these poems, she then began to experiment both with more personal subject matter and with a freer style, a result largely of the influence of Lowell, Sexton, Roethke, and of course Hughes himself. "Point Shirley," originally entitled "Point Shirley, Revisited," was composed on the weekend of January 16-17 (J 293). A tribute to her grandmother, the poem uses the details of the Schobers' house to comment on the destructiveness of nature and the isolation of the individual. On January 20, Plath began the sonnet "Goatsucker" for Esther Baskin's book on nocturnal animals 4 and a week later produced "The Bull of Bendylaw," which she herself 1959 Hughes's Chronology Reordered Chronology "The Bull of Bendylaw" Jan. 16-17 "Point Shirley" "The Eye-mote" 20 "Goatsucker" "Point Shirley" 27 "The Bull of Bendylaw" "Goatsucker" Jan./Feb.?

"Words for a Nursery" "Private Ground" described the next day as "a silly poem about a bull-ocean which evades all direct statement of anything under the pretense of symbolic allegory" (J 294). Another poem in the allegorical mode, "The Hermit at Outermost House," must have been written at this time or even in the fall of 1958 when she turned to allegory almost exclusively in conjunction with syllabics (7 per line in this case); this contention is supported by its publication in the Spring 1959 issue of Audience (Lane and Stevens 23) as well as her reference in a February 25 journal entry to abandoning such fictional characters as hermits, indicating that it was written prior to that date (298). On January 28 Plath records in her journal a "Sudden desire to do a series of Cambridge and Benidorm poems" (294). Although only "Watercolor of Grantchester Meadows" can be specifically dated, "The Eye-mote," "The Net-Menders," and "The Beggars" seem likely products of this desire, with "Two Views of a Cadaver Room" as a possible off-shoot. The composition of the first is noted in a journal entry for February 19: "Wrote a Grantchester poem of pure description. I must get philosophy in. Until I do I shall lag behind [Adrienne Rich]" (296). Despite this criticism, the poem does express the "philosophy" that, beneath its benign and charming appearance, nature is violent and destructive. February or March may well have seen the composition of "The Eye-mote," a meditation on the loss of innocence based on an incident that occurred in Cambridge in March 1956; of "The Net-Menders," a description of elderly women at their work in the fishing village of Benidorm, with philosophical musings on human mortality; 5 and of "The Beggars," a harsh criticism of the mendicants at Benidorm's outdoor market. While the syllabic patterns of the latter two may indicate that they belong to the summer of 1958, their consistent appearance in lists of poems sent out in the fall of 1959 (Plath Collection, Smith College) suggests that they had been produced more recently. "Two Views of a Cadaver Room" seems to have been written in February or March as well, for its subject matter is similar to that in a number of poems composed then. Since Plath had surely seen Breughel's The Triumph of Death in Madrid's Prado Museum on July 10, 1956, it may well have been evoked by memories of Spain explored in the Benidorm poems. Further, like "Suicide off Egg Rock" and "Electra on Azalea Path," it also concerns memories of her college days. That it was accepted for publication in TLS on July 6, 1959 (Plath Collection, Smith College), confirms that it was composed well before that date. In addition to "Point Shirley," a product of mid January, a number of poems composed in February and March reflect Winthrop or its environs. According to a journal entry for February 19, Plath began "Suicide off Egg Rock" on that date: "I began a poem, 'Suicide Off Egg Rock [sic],' but set up such a strict verse form that all power was lost" (296); however, on February 25 she reports that she has revised it extensively with positive results: "Wrote a ghastly poem in strictly varying line lengths with no feeling in it though the scene was fraught with emotion. Then did it over, much better: got something of what I wanted. . . . My main thing now is to start with real things: real emotions" (298). Although using her own experiences from the summer of 1953 and the location of Lynn Beach, just north of Winthrop, Plath nevertheless distances these personal origins by using a third-person speaker to describe the point of view of a male protagonist on the verge of committing suicide. In an entry for March 9, Plath notes that on the previous day she wrote the octave of "The Ravaged Face," thus completing the sonnet whose sestet she had written a day or so earlier after a "lugubrious" session with Beuscher: "Got idea on trolley for a poem because of my ravaged face [caused by excessive crying]: called 'The Ravaged Face.' A line came, too. Wrote it down and then the five lines of a sestet. Wrote the first eight lines after coming back from a fine afternoon in Winthrop yesterday. I rather like it" (299). Excessively emotional, awkward in diction, and ambiguous in meaning, the poem is among the weakest of this year. However, that visit to Winthrop also inspired one of her very best poems of 1959, "Electra on Azalea Path." In the March 9 entry she tells of going to her father's grave in the Winthrop cemetery, perhaps a result of her sessions with Beuscher in which, among other things, she was exploring her feelings of anguish and guilt about his death. The poem, completed by March 20 (J 300), is a highly complex psychological portrait of a daughter's response to her father's death. Also finished by March 20 was "Metaphors for a Pregnant Woman," later shortened to "Metaphors." Having indicated in the March 9 entry that she intended to write "some good pregnant poems, if I know I really am" (300), she produced this poem during the next ten days when she felt certain that such was the case; ironically, on the very day that she noted its completion, she also recorded her disappointment at not being pregnant after all. "Man in Black" is another poem inspired by the Winthrop visit and composed about March 20. In recording its acceptance by The New Yorker in an entry for April 23, she reveals that she "wrote [it] only a little over a month ago on one of my fruitful visits to Winthrop. . . . The 'dead black' . . . may be a transference from the visit to my father's grave" (301-302). In an unpublished portion of the March 9 journal entry, Plath tells of walking along the rocks by the ocean near Water Tower Hill, noting that Hughes in his black coat had gone out to the end of the sand bar, and then of continuing on to Deer Island Prison, where they talked with a guard about the animals there (Plath Collection, Smith College). The poem demonstrates how a focal figure (either father or husband) gives order and meaning to the world. Three other poems whose precise dates of composition cannot be confirmed may have been evoked by the March visit(s) to Winthrop as well, reflecting that location in various ways. "A Winter Ship" and "Old Ladies' Home" both use actual landmarks of the town. The former, a meditation on nature's ability to destroy or outlast things human, focuses on a dilapidated wharf in Winthrop's harbor, while the latter, a sensitive and moving portrait of old age, is probably based on the General Winthrop Nursing Home only six blocks from her parents' house on Johnson Avenue. "The Beekeeper's Daughter" with its deeper exploration of the father-daughter relationship and its use of the bee metaphor may well be a follow-up to "Electra on Azalea Path," evoked by the March 8 visit to Otto Plath's grave. However, because of its subject matter and use of a surrealistic setting, it is also possible that it was composed in the fall in conjunction with "The Colossus" and "Poem for a Birthday"; further support for the latter date is its submission along with those two and "The Manor Garden" to The Kenyon Review on November 3, according to Plath's list of poems sent out in the fall of 1959 (Plath Collection, Smith College). Finally, "Aftermath," a philosophical sonnet on humanity's obsession with the tragic and sordid, also seems to have been written in March. In an unpublished passage of the journal entry for March 9, Plath reports that, on returning to Boston from the Winthrop visit the previous day, she and Hughes had observed the smouldering remains of a great fire in a burnt-out building, an event which apparently inspired the composition of this poem soon afterward as it was published in the Fall 1959 issue of Arts in Society (Lane and Stevens 13). Plath apparently wrote no poetry from April to September of 1959. In April, May, and June she concentrated on short fiction, noting in a journal entry for May 31, "I have written six stories this year, and the three best of them in the last two weeks! . . . My poems are so far in the background now. It is a very healthy antidote, this prose, to the poems' intense limitations" (307, 309). In July and August, she and Hughes toured the United States, returning to Wellesley at the end of August for a brief visit. Pregnant with their first child, she seems to have begun writing poetry again just prior to or just after September 9, when the two went to the artists' colony of Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York, for a period of ten weeks. Because she recorded in her journals much of what she produced there, accurate composition dates can be established for many of the poems of this time. "Magnolia Shoals," "Yaddo: The Grand Manor," "Medallion," and "Polly's Tree" seem to be the earliest of this group, produced between early September and early October. All employ syllabics and triplets, suggesting that, after her five-month layoff, Plath began to write again in the strict forms with which she had always felt most comfortable; further, they are carefully distanced, using objects or settings as subjects. "Magnolia Shoals" may have been inspired by and written soon after a trip to the seaside town of Magnolia, just south of Gloucester, made no doubt during the visit to Wellesley, a contention supported by the poem's description of the departure of summer at a coastal setting. "Yaddo: The Grand Manor," a contrast between the richness of this setting and the artistic sterility of one of its guests, may well be the first poem composed at Yaddo; many of its details are echoed in a journal entry for September 16 in which she also complains of her inability to produce (313-314). Both poems were written prior to September 21, when, according to her list of poems sent out during the fall of 1959, Plath mailed them to The New Yorker (Plath Collection, Smith College). 6 Concerning "Medallion," originally entitled "Snake," Plath records in a journal entry of September 25 that she has written "one good poem so far: an imagist piece on the dead snake" (315), noting on October 6 that it will be the first poem of a new book (320). More than "an imagist piece," "Medallion" is a meditation on the beauty and ugliness of death, with the emphasis on the former. The slight, whimsical "Polly's Tree," "a syllabic exercise in delicacy about Polly's tree. Coy but rather fun," was written on October 5 (J 320). 7 "Dark Wood, Dark Water" and "The Sleepers" were probably produced in early to mid October, for both were mailed along with "Polly's Tree," "The Net-Menders," and "Spinach Picker" to The New Yorker on November 3, according to her record of poem submissions for the fall (Plath Collection, Smith College). A mood piece describing the feelings both of melancholy and of pleasure evoked by the autumnal grounds of Yaddo, the former employs the triplet and a syllabic count of five. The latter, which does not use the scenery of Yaddo, the triplet, nor a consistent syllabic pattern (although most lines have six syllables), is an ambiguous work which seems to treat the changes lovers undergo as their relationship develops; its mediocrity suggests that it was written prior to the spate of stunning poems produced from mid October to early November. Turning to freer forms and highly personal subject matter, Plath composed "The Manor Garden" and "The Colossus" in the days just prior to October 19: "I tried Ted's 'exercise': deep-breathing, concentration on stream-of-consciousness objects, these last days, and wrote two poems that pleased me. One a poem to Nicholas [the baby she was carrying], and one the old father-worship subject" (J 323). "The Manor Garden," using as its setting the famous rose gardens of Yaddo, is a striking expression of the intensely heightened anxiety felt by a mother-to-be for the emotional, mental, and physical well-being of her unborn child, while "The Colossus," employing the surrealistic "setting" of the enormous head of the ruined statue, explores yet again the complexities of the father-daughter relationship, a subject often treated in 1958 and 1959; in this case, however, the daughter ultimately rejects her obsession with him. Because its subject matter is similar to that of "The Colossus" and because it was submitted to The Kenyon Review along with "The Manor Garden," "The Colossus," and "Poem for a Birthday" on November 3 (List of poem submissions, Plath Collection, Smith College), "The Beekeeper's Daughter" may well have been produced at this time rather than earlier in the year. On October 22, Plath began the series of seven poems comprising "Poem for a Birthday," in which she experiments both with subject matter and with style; she records in a journal entry for that date, "Ambitious seeds of a long poem made up of separate sections: Poem on [her] birthday. To be a dwelling on madhouse, nature: . . . vivid and disjointed" (324). Carrying out the new commitment implied at the end of "The Colossus," this work focuses on the protagonist's own experiences and emotions as she battles to reconstruct herself rather than her father. The new style is conveyed by "vivid and disjointed." She completed it by November 3, when she sent it out to The Kenyon Review , as noted above (Plath Collection, Smith College; see also J 327). "The Burnt-out Spa" was written between November 8, when Plath and Hughes had walked to a ruined spa near Yaddo, and November 11, when she refers in her journal to having written it that week (330); the setting seems to function as a symbol of rebirth in nature which is not available to human beings. Also completed "to our satisfaction" by November 11 (J 331) was "Blue Moles," based on two dead moles Plath and Hughes had seen on October 22 (J 324); here Plath considers the indifference of nature to the destruction of its own creatures. Two days later, on Friday the 13th, she wrote "Mushrooms," inspired both by mushrooms observed in front of West House at Yaddo and recorded in an unpublished portion of a journal entry of October 10 (Plath Collection, Smith College) and by the topic "mushrooms, that they think they are going to take over the world" given to her by Hughes (Kroll 236). As in other poems of the period, "Mushrooms" is noteworthy in its unusual speakers, the mushrooms themselves, in its portrayal of the violence of nature, and in its technical virtuosity and its organic linking of style and content, particularly in terms of syllabics, triplets, and sound values. Two other poems also seem to be products of November, although irrefutable evidence has not been discovered. Although Hughes has placed "Words for a Nursery" in the 1957 section of The Collected Poems , it seems much more likely that it was a product of the fall of 1959, or perhaps slightly later. Its original title "Poem for a Nursery" (Plath Collection, Smith College) links it to "Poem for a Birthday"; its subject matter, the formation of the right hand of a foetus, reflects Plath's pregnancy and her interest in related matters, as evidenced in "The Manor Garden" and "Poem for a Birthday"; its unusual speaker, the hand itself, is similar to other experiments with narrators of the time; and its strange combination of disjointed structure and bizarre, ambiguous images with five stanzas of ten lines each and five syllables per line (a technical echo of the hand) indicates her struggle at this time between freer, more open forms and the rigid ones which she had always preferred. "Private Ground" provides several internal clues suggesting a composition date of mid November or somewhat later; its references to eleven weeks, to "First frost," and to a walk in Yaddo's rose garden with its goldfish pools and statues echo details of a similar walk recorded in an unpublished portion of the journal entry of November 11, especially its description of the grass shining with melted frost (Plath Collection, Smith College). That neither of these poems appears in Plath's list of submissions to magazines during the fall of 1959 suggests that they were not composed early in the season; indeed, since both "The Burnt-out Spa" and "Mushrooms" were sent out on November 28, it seems valid to suppose that the two in question were written after November 13. The chronology herein proposed is far more definitive than that established by Hughes in The Collected Poems . Whenever possible, it corrects errors of placement by presenting evidence of exact or close dates of composition, according to various sources. In those cases in which hard evidence does not exist, it suggests the most likely composition dates, based on all available material. Since an entirely accurate chronology may never be a reality, it seems imperative to move as close to that ideal as possible in order to chart the course of Plath's development with more validity. Indeed, this revised chronology allows us more effectively to follow her often frustrating search for compelling subject matter, her wide-ranging experimentation with various techniques (as, for example, with syllabics in the summer of 1958), her methods, habits, and problems of composition, her struggle between the accepted current dictates on the impersonality of the poet and her magnetic attraction to the subjective, and her creation of a very striking repertoire of metaphors, images, and symbols. Plath scholarship has begun to recognize the importance of the poems produced from 1956 to 1959 to her canon as a whole, and this chronology should prove a helpful aid in their further exploration. 8 Works Cited Hughes, Ted, ed.

For an interesting discussion of Plath's poems on art, see Leonard M. Scigaj, "The Painterly Plath That Nobody Knows," Centennial Review 32 (Summer 1988): 220-249. 4 Esther Baskin's children's book Creatures of the Night (1962) contains a prose section on the goatsucker with an illustration by Leonard Baskin. Plath's poem, however, is not included, although a poem by Hughes entitled "Esther's Tomcat" appears in another section. Plath's numerous notes on the characteristics of and superstitions about the bird can be found in the Plath Collection, Smith College. 5 Plath's article "Sketchbook of a Spanish Summer," which was published in the Christian Science Monitor on November 6, 1956, contains a passage on Benidorm's netmenders that is echoed in the poem: "Later, in the cool of the day, the tanned, elderly women sit outside their doorways in wooden chairs, backs to the street, weaving nets of thick rope or fine mesh." 6 After The New Yorker rejected them for publication on September 28, Plath sent "Magnolia Shoals" to Harpers on September 30. When it was returned on October 8, she sent the two to the Christian Science Monitor on October 9; both were accepted on October 13 for $20. See Plath's list of submissions for the fall of 1959.

      <field name="heading_text">From The London Mercury by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The National Union Catalogue gives the various titles enjoyed by the periodical which started as The London Mercury (hereafter LM ) and which retained that name for its first thirty-nine volumes. It ran monthly from November 1919 to April 1939. The first editor (November 1919-September 1934) was John Collings Squire (later to be knighted)—poet, critic, editor, anthologizer, historian, and miscellaneous writer. He was succeeded by Rolfe Arnold Scott-James, described in the Dictionary of National Biography as "journalist, editor, and literary critic." After volume 39 the periodical became Life and Letters . Although the LM is well-known and by no means rare, and although very many of the then or now famous English (and some American) writers contributed to it, it has been ignored or forgotten by many bibliographers, biographers, editors, and literary critics. Some poems which appeared originally in it never were reprinted. Others underwent revisions, some slight, some extensive; these revisions have, for the most part, gone unnoted. The reviews of some writers have been noted by bibliographers and biographers; those of others have been overlooked. And there are letters to the editor of which some notice should have been taken. Finally, here are a long letter by George Eliot, not in her collected correspondence, some fragments of letters by Thackeray and the original draft of a poem by him, a short letter by Charles Lamb, and a longer one by "Barry Cornwall." Because the George Eliot letter may command most interest I quote it first. It forms part of a piece by Canon N. Egerton Leigh titled "A Collection of Autographs" printed in the January 1920 number (1:321-323). 16 Blandford Square, London, N.W. My dear Friend—I was delighted to have your letter this morning bringing me good news not only of a literary but of a personal kind. It is pleasant to know that your labours on Adam have been so far appreciated; but I think it is pleasanter still to know that Maman has had the comfort of seeing her son Charles this Christmas, and that your prospects concerning him are hopeful. I begin, you know, to consider myself an experienced matron, knowing a great deal about parental joys and anxieties. Indeed I have rather too ready a talent for entering into anxieties of all sorts. Mr. Lewes is very much obliged to you for sending him the prospectus and additional information, which he has already dispatched to Mr. Trollope. It will be a valuable widening of his opportunities for choosing a foreign school. I was not aware till I gathered the fact from your letter that Emile Forgues had "analysed" the Mill for the Revue des deux Mondes , for Mr. Lewes, knowing that it would vex me, had carefully concealed it. It is an impudent way of getting money—this cool appropriation of other people's property without leave asked—which seems to have become a regular practice with him. Pray consider me responsible for nothing but what you find in the Tauchnitz edition. I never alter my books after they are printed —never alter anything of importance even in the course of printing, and ce n'est point mon histoire que j'écris , or whatever else you may find in M. Forgues' edition that is not in the English is due to the gratuitous exercise of his own talents in improving my book. I can well imagine that you find the Mill more difficult to render than Adam , but would it be inadmissible to represent in French, at least in some degree, those intermédiaires entre le style commun et le style élégant to which you refer? It seems to me that I have discerned such shades very strikingly rendered in Balzac, and occasionally in George Sand. Balzac, I think, dares to be thoroughly congenial, in spite of French strait-lacing. Even in English this daring is far from being general: inferior writers are hardly ever capable of it, and in the great mass of English fiction, from Bulwer down to the latest young lady scribbler, you find scarcely anything but impossible dialogue—the character speaking as no man or woman ever spoke, except on the stage. The writers who dare to be thoroughly familiar are Shakespeare, Fielding, Scott (when he is representing the popular life with which he is familiar), and indeed every other writer of fiction of the first class. Even in his loftiest tragedies, in Hamlet , for example, Shakespeare is intensely colloquial. One hears the very accent of living men. I am not vindicating the practice, I know that is not necessary to you who have so quick a sensibility for the real and the humorous, but I want to draw your attention to what you may not have observed—the timid elegance ( alias unnaturalness) of inferior English writers. You may not have observed it, because naturally you don't read our poorer literature. You, of course, have knowledge as to what is or can be done in French literature beyond any that my reading can have furnished me with. I am glad that you think there are any readers who will prefer the Mill to Adam . To my feeling there is more thought and a profounder veracity in the Mill than in Adam ; but Adam is more complete and better balanced. My love of the childhood scenes made me linger over them in epic fashion, so that I could not develop as fully as I wished the concluding "Book" in which the tragedy occurs, and which I had looked forward to with much intention and preparation from the beginning. My books don't seem to belong to me after I have once written them, so I find myself delivering opinions about them as if I had nothing to do with them. I am not afraid that you will be unable to distinguish that frankness from conceit. I cannot write very boastfully about our health; both Mr. Lewes and I are very middling, easily upset, easily put out of order. But in all other respects our happiness grows daily. Our dear boy Charles is more and more precious to us, and seems to delight in pouring all his young affection out in tenderness to me. Thornton, the second, is going on well and happily with his studies at Edinburgh, and seems to have profited morally and physically by the change. I don't know how to describe our locality otherwise than by saying that it lies very near Regent's Park, westward . It is a quiet situation for London—alas, not quiet for me, who dream of still fields! London is hateful to me, and I sometimes think we shall hardly have come to stay in it three years. Mr. Lewes and I constantly recall Geneva—and for us Geneva means all that is associated with you and Maman. It was a vivid pleasure to me that he felt his liking and admiration go out to you both quite apart from the fact that you were my friends. He desires to share in all assurances of affection that I send you. But I send you few assurances. Are they necessary? Recourse to Gordon S. Haight's George Eliot: A Biography (1968) makes it possible to identify the recipient as Francois D'Albert-Durade and to date the letter at some time soon after Christmas, 1860, when George Eliot and George Henry Lewes had moved to 16 Blandford Square (p. 334). Students of George Eliot's work will welcome her remarks on French and English writers as well on Adam Bede and on The Mill on the Floss . Gordon N. Ray's edition of Thackeray's letters includes a single letter from the Reverend William Henry Brookfield to Thackeray of date 26 February 1850, announcing the birth of a daughter. 1 The letter is described as "Hitherto unpublished." The letter was published in the April 1925 LM (11:613) as part of a piece titled "The Melancholy Humorist and His Friends. A Victorian Scrap Book" Part II, by "Lieut.-Col. C. B. Thackeray, D.S.O." Thackeray replied by return post the same day, addressing his letter to the newborn child, Magdalene Brookfield, in an envelope addressed to the Rev. W. H. Brookfield. "On the inside of the flap of the envelop," I am quoting Lieut. Col. Thackeray, "is the following:—My dear Vieux, I give thee joy. Will you kindly enclose the enclosed. Ever yours, W.M.T." (11:613-614). "The enclosed" was the letter to Magdalene, designated by Gordon Ray as also "Hitherto unpublished" (2:639). The congratulatory message to the father is not in Ray's edition. Nor is what Lieut. Col. Thackeray describes as A fragment of a letter follows, in what the dealers call "the sloping hand-writing," to distinguish it from his more usual small upright hand-writing, which is almost as much a joy to look at as an old illuminated manuscript. * We—like good old folks as we are beginning to be—for, look, are not the young ones growing up—and our place in the rear rank is marked out for us— They have paid me back my money at the bank—that's a little comfort, isn't it? And I have got the first sheets of Col. Esmond in my pocket—finished in a very nice type and looking very handsome. And I have been to dine at Holland House . . . I have begun a little of a new story and now I think you have seen my little budget of news. O ladies how hungry I am! and how absurd it is of Horris Mansfield not to dine till 8 o'clock, God bless you two, and give my love to your girls and remember that I am always yours and yours, W. M. T. (p. 614) The date of the letter must be 1852, the date of publication of Henry Esmond ; the recipients are unknown as is the identity of Horris [Horace?] Mansfield, no Mansfield of that name figuring in the literature on Thackeray, unless he is the "Mansfield" of Thackeray's diary for 1858 (4:393). Neither Arthur or Charles Mansfield of the Letters is identifiable as "Horris" because of the date. The asterisk to the above fragment is keyed to a footnote which reveals the existence of another Thackeray letter not listed in Ray's edition: In Sotheby's list for November, 1922, one of the items, belonging to the Duchess of St. Albans, in a letter from W.M. Thackerary to Mr. Hallam, dated 1852, with a postscript. "I forget whether I have ever had the honour of writing to you in my old original hand writing, but the above used to be my hand, and I find myself returning super antiquas vias ." He adopted the small upright handwriting in order to save space in his MSS. There is no index listing for the Duchess of St. Albans in Ray's edition. The Reverend Mr. Brookfield was also able to preserve the original version of the ballad, Mrs. Katherine's Lantern, written in a Lady's Album . I allow him to tell the story in his own words. Dickens's daughter, Mrs. Perugini is, happily, still with us. It was to her that Thackeray addressed the verses Mrs. Katherine's Lantern, written in a Lady's Album . A little scrap of note-paper, with its scores and erasures, lies before me, on which he began these lines. The fragment differs from the finished ballad, and it may be of interest to compare it with the published version. Thackeray's verse flowed from his pen less readily than his prose, which he wrote with extraordinary fluency and very few corrections, in his exquisite handwriting. Here is the original: An old lantern battered, black Bruised and scarred with flaw and crack A bad lot I know it is Why then should I purchase this Queer old specimen of disreputable bric-a-brac? Passing through a gloomy Court Where the Israelites resort This old lamp I chanced to see With initials K &amp; E And I pondered who was she Erst the Mistress of this wreath And that anagram beneath The mysterious K &amp; E? Full a hundred years are gone Since the little beacon shone From a Venice balcony— Towards the window where it burned Ah what eager eyes were turned Celebrating K &amp; E! Braving storm and night and wind How the lover yearned and pined Gazing at the little flame Hark in the canal below Sure you hear the plash of rowers? Yes they rest upon their oars Underneath the balcony And a thrilling voice begins To the sound of mandolins— Begins singing of amore And delire and dolore O the ravishing tenore! (p. 617) The considerably revised and expanded version (46 lines as opposed to the 32 of the fragment) is easily accessible for comparison. Lines 15-17 and the last five lines of the fragment are retained verbatim, and there are other part lines and phrases that go into the revised poem. The difference in the number of lines between the two versions is the result of the addition of fourteen lines to the end of the text in the fragment. "The Melancholy Humorist and His Friends," encountered in volume 11, was continued and concluded in volume 12 (pp. 54-68). The Reverend Mr. Brookfield's letters are quoted as are some to him and to his wife. One letter was given to Mrs. Brookfield by the editor of the Athenaeum , C. W. Dilke, to whom it was addressed. The date is given as 1833 and the letter is from Charles Lamb: "Dear Sir, My address is no longer 'Enfield'; but 'Mr. Walden's Church Street, Edmonton': so you see I mean to remain your obligee for pleasant Athenaeums; my poor sister is very bad with her old illnesses. In haste and trouble. Yours, C. LAMB." Lieut. Col. Thackeray comments, "The address is of interest in view of the concern shown by the public when the sale of Lamb's last home [he died in 1834] was announced the other day" (12:65). 2 Another and longer letter is that of Bryan Waller Procter ("Barry Cornwall") to Mrs. Brookfield. Procter and the Brookfields had a mutual friend in Thackeray. Procter's book on Charles Lamb had just been published, thus the date of the letter would have to be between July 16 and August 9, 1866, when Procter was seventy-nine years old. The dates are of letters from Procter to John Forster who published the book on Lamb, the latter letter indicating that the book had been published. 3 Procter and his daughter Adelaide were friends of the Brookfields, something one would not learn from Armour's biography, but which is quite evident from this letter. Many thanks for your letter—for your active support of Charles Lamb—and for all your kindness. I regret your suggestions that I should not write to you. I see that you are afraid of "The Parson of the Parish"—whom however I shall hope to elude. Altho' he professes to like your present on his birthday—I yet see that he is a little uncomfortable that you should retain any regard for poor Lamb. I shall therefore proceed very cautiously, and shall express nothing at present, beyond the gratitude and pleasure your note has given me. You will read all this, as a mere joke, my dear Mrs. Brookfield, from a dashing young fellow rusticated from London. But wait!—see what time will produce. How—when London shall "loom" upon me as well as on the Zealander, I hope to tell you some day, personally, how pleasant and sunshiny your letter was. Everybody as far as I know has been good-natured to the poor book. Everybody liked Lamb, and I do not conceal from myself that much of what has been said is out of regard for the subject of the book, rather than for the author. (My hand is so old that I can scarcely form the letters.) Are you very pastoral in Lincolnshire? Do you feed the lambs there? Have you a Good Shepherd? Innocent sheep? I waive all answer to these queries on condition that you and the Rev. W. H. B. keep (as I hope you now are) well and happy. Believe me very sincerely your obliged, B. W. PROCTER. (12:61) A number of poems printed in LM do not appear in the Collected, Selected, or Complete Poems of various writers. Vita Sackville-West's Collected Poems, Volume One was published in 1933 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press in London. There was no subsequent volume. Among the acknowledgments "for having published my work in the first instance" is that to LM . Miss Sackville-West's contributions to LM were Winter Song (7:128-129); Three Poems ( Moonlight, Song , "If I had only loved your flesh", Song "Little I asked—but that little denied me") (8:8-9); Making Cider and Bee-Master (8:567-570); Tuscany (9:461-462); Woodcraft (11:567-569); Black Tarn (15:458-459); and Illusions (20:556), which was actually part of her King's daughter and is in the Collected Poems (p. 317). Black Tarn is also included in the Collected Poems , with, incidentally, two changes, line 13 in LM reading, "May scan the head of the mountains dwelling in the mist" for which 1933 has "Their heads, mist-dwelling." "The dull" of line 25 in LM becomes "Dull" in 1933. What is of especial interest is the text of Bee-Master which appeared in the issue for October 1923. Its next appearance was as part of the section Spring in The Land (1926), a text with ten lines added at the end, a text which was reprinted in Selected Poems (1941). The LM text was much revised, for not only were ten lines added at the end but another ten were added to become lines 15 to 24 of the expanded poem. One has, then, three, texts: the 94 lines in LM , the 104 lines in The Land , and the 114 lines in Selected Poems (1941). The poem is not included in the Collected Poems of 1933. 4 I proceed with the other examples of revisions ignored. The greatest of the revisers among the poets contributing to LM was Walter de la Mare. He contributed twelve poems over the years; ten were revised (sometimes, a single line). I shall relegate some of the slighter revisions to footnotes; the order is LM first and Complete Poems (1969) second. 5 Sotto Voce (4:346-347) (1969 adds To Thomas Edwards to the title) is more extensively revised than the other two poems in volume four. 6 There are three revisions in The Last Coachload (5:121-123). 7 While there are five revisions in The Encounter (17:354), they, too, may be relegated to a footnote. 8 Episodes appeared in volume 27 (p. 489). 9 There are but two changes in The Cherry Trees (35:105). 10 The revisions in Swallows Flown (35:106) transform this little poem of but six lines: l. 1, the/that; l. 2, That has haunted me so of late?/Haunting the livelong day?; l. 3, The absence of something scarcely heeded/This void, where sweetness, so seldom heeded; l. 4, Yet with me, early and late/Once ravished my heart away?" l. 5, wait./stay?. finally, the poem Memory (37:110-112), to which de la Mare added twenty lines (78-97) in revising the LM text (de la Mare has two poems titled Memory ; this one is on pages 373-375 of 1969). 11 Padraic Colum was also given to revising his poems, in the instance of his poem Nests in LM (7:239) he not only revised the text but also the title, i.e., to The Poet . His poems were collected in 1932; those readings are second: l. 1 nest/ om ; l. 2 nests/ om. ; l. 3, They're . . . said he/They are . . . he said; l. 5, Here/There; l. 5 is/ om. ; l. 6, A mark in the/Marks an; l. 9, By the inland lake, its shore/By shore of the inland lake; l. 10, the/ om. ; l. 12, the/ om ; l. 12, cattle's/cattles'; l. 16, a/ om ; l. 19, the briar/briars; l. 22, take widest way/have widest sway; l. 24 bred with their/reared with. LM has a penultimate stanza not in 1932: "Till you own like other peoples; / Till the breath of your need be stopped; / Till your salt shall lose its savour, / And your virgin soil be cropped." D. H. Lawrence contributed two poems to LM , one in volume 21 (November 1929-April 1930), Bells , p. 893; the other in volume 22 (May-October 1930), The Triumph of the Machine . Both were revised. Warren Roberts, editor of the Soho bibliography (1963) of Lawrence's works, notes that "revisions and changes are frequently indicated" (p. 10), but there is no indication that these two poems were revised. The revisions are not slight. LM readings are followed by those in the Complete Poems of 1972: Bells , l. 1, om /that; ll. 2 and 5, obscure/obscene; l. 7, in a . . . mouth/in . . . mouths; l. 11, fingers . . . fists/finger-fist; l. 12, om. /old; l. 14, when/where; l. 16, thickets/thicket; l. 17, cave/core. The editors of the Complete Poems print both the original and revised versions of The Triumph of the Machine , but either fail to note the revisions in Bells or think them unimportant (see their page 24). A poem by Leigh Hunt, To Shelley , was printed in the November 1922 LM with this footnote: "For this unpublished poem by Leigh Hunt we are indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Chaundy &amp; Cox of 40 Maddox Street, who possess the MS. The mood and manner suggest that the lines were written about the date of Hunt's book, 'The Religion of the Heart,' 1853. 'One other sweet fervid voice' is, probably, that of Vincent Hunt, whose death in 1852 deprived Leigh Hunt of his favourite child.—Editor" (7:16). The poem is printed among the Notes in the 1923 Poetical Works , edited for the Oxford University Press by H. S. Milford, who writes, "By the kindness of Mr. Trevor Leigh-Hunt I am enabled to print for the first time the following blankverse poem" (p. 719). The texts are substantively identical. Mr. Milford was not the first to print the poem, nor did he suggest any probable date for the poem or the identity of the "Other sweet fervid voice." Some measure of Hunt's grief at the death of his son may be had from his Autobiography where he writes "My son's Christian name was Vincent. This is only the second time I have dared to write it. He died at the close of October, in the year 1852, and was buried in beautiful Kensal Green, my own final bedchamber, I trust, in this world" (p. 541 in the World Classics edition). Vincent, who died of tuberculosis, wrote verses. Is it fanciful to equate these facts with "sweet fervid voice"? I have chosen a few of the letters to the editor because of their authors and because, of course, letters to editors are usually not included in editions of the correspondence of writers. Some of George Bernard Shaw's letters to various editors have been reprinted, 12 but so many of his letters have had to be excluded from the four-volume edition of his correspondence that exclusion of other letters to editors has been mandatory. There is a profusion of riches; hence one more letter may seem superrogatory. Max Kenyon, musicologist, author of Harpsichord Music (1905) and the later Mozart in Salzberg (1959), wrote " To the Editor of the London Mercury and Bookman" to protest Shaw's statement that Mozart had written the conclusion to Gluck's overture to Iphigenia in Aulis and to clear up the matter (37:532). Shaw's letter of gratitude was printed below Kenyon's. Dear Sir, —I am deeply grateful to Mr. Max Kenyon for disabusing me of the notion that Mozart did that very ordinary bandmaster's job, the concert ending to Gluck's Iphigenia overture. And now may I put in a plea for the concert performances of the overture to Don Giovanni ? It also is provided with a very similar finish, no doubt by the same Johann Schmidt. This was considered necessary in the days when overtures as concert pieces had to end, in the key in which they began, with the usual tonic and dominant rum-tum-bang burlesqued by Beethoven and finally relegated to the dustbin by Wagner. The overture, in D, suddenly and very arrestingly leaves that key and leads to the opening scene of the opera by a close in F. Why should it not be played so and left so? Nobody will rise in the audience and protest against it not closing in D. Nobody wants a vulgar ending to be substituted for a beautiful one with a promise in the last chord. Schmidt has had his day; now let us have Mozart. Faithfully G. BERNARD SHAW (12:532) I have not located the source of Shaw's pronouncement on Gluck's overture; it is not in his "Gluck in Glastonbury" in the May 6, 1916, Nation . A second letter, this one to the editors of the LM and the Bookman of London, is by Dorothy Sayers and is of interest in that she not only explains her use of the pseudonym Johanna Leigh but more than implies that she will write more "straight" novels under that name. In the event, her straight autobiographical novel Cat o' Mary was never finished and hence never published, although it had been announced as to be published. 13 Sir, —May I correct the rather unfortunate impression unintentionally conveyed by Mr. A. C. Hannay's article, "Inns, Horses and Dogs" in the December issue of The Bookman ? I have not been "reduced" to adopting a pseudonym in order to "persuade" my publisher to accept my forthcoming "straight" novel, Cat o' Mary . The pseudonym was adopted at my own suggestion and, if anything, rather against Mr. Gollancz's inclinations, as a matter of pure convenience to the public. Whether they prefer their novels "straight" or detective, I think readers have a right to know beforehand which they are getting. The simplest way to ensure this is to make a plain ruling that all "Dorothy L. Sayers" books shall be detective and all "Johanna Leigh" books straight. The fact that my own name has been attached to all preliminary announcements of Cat o' Mary shows that neither Mr. Gollancz nor myself finds any need for secrecy in the matter. (31:379) Evidently there were to have been more "Johanna Leigh" books. The third letter to the editor I have chosen is by John Gould Fletcher. In his autobiography, Life is My Song (1937), Fletcher explains the circumstances which prompted him to write his letter to the editor of LM , J. C. Squire. Writing of the popularity in England of Vachel Lindsay's poetry, he remarked that "the foremost of the academic pontiffs, J. C. Squire, had led off his London Mercury of that month [Dec. 1919] with the 'Bryan' poem [by Lindsay] in its entirety, and had followed this up with critical remarks to the effect that Vachel Lindsay was the only American poet who mattered, inasmuch as he was the only one whose attitude and subject matter were totally and exclusively American" (p. 281). Gould, as is evident from his letter, did not think too highly of Lindsay's poetry at that time, although he later changed his opinion. Here is the letter. Sir, —The writer of your "Letter from America," in the December number, commits himself to the astonishing statement that "Mr. Nicholas Vachel Lindsay is the one American writer of verse whose work shows signs of genius." Such a statement should not pass unchallenged. It is as if an American writer, visiting England, were to remark that Mr. Rudyard Kipling is the only English writer of verse with signs of genius. The parallel is quite exact. Lindsay has the same free-and-easy facility, the same preference for ragtime rhythms, the same tone of vulgar optimism, the same desire to preach a gospel, as the author of Mandalay . The only difference is that Lindsay is rather more limited in his range, if anything. He has never succeeded in doing but one type of poem—the ragtime exhortation. To say that he and he alone in America shows genius is preposterous. What about Robert Frost, whose work and influence were paramount in the development of Edward Thomas?—a fact admitted by a recent biographer. What about Edwin Arlington Robinson, a poet who comes nearer to Hardy than anyone in America? What about Conrad Aiken, Carl Sandburg, Wallace Stevens, Alfred Kreymborg, Maxwell Bodenheim? All of these authors have shown signs of genius, each in an entirely different and quite individual way. They have not repeated themselves into tedious stereotype as the magazine writers of vers libre , or as Mr. Lindsay has. Without any desire to belittle Mr. Lindsay's clever but superficial talent, I should respectfully suggest to "R. E. C." that some of his remarks about the conventionality of American writers apply very strongly to Lindsay. They do not apply to the men I have just mentioned.—Yours, etc., John Gould Fletcher. 37 Crystal Palace Park Road, Sydenham. (1:329-330) Gould named Frost, Robinson, Aiken, Sandburg, Stevens, Kreymborg, and Bodenheim as American poets equal to or better than Lindsay. Evidently the matter rankled, for soon thereafter, Gould contributed a thirty-one page article, "Some Contemporary American Poets," to The Chapbook. A Monthly Miscellany (May, 1920) edited by Harold Munro. Gould discussed, in this order, the poetry of Robinson, Frost, Amy Lowell, Edgar Lee Masters, Sandburg, Lindsay (whom he praises for his humor, and for nothing else), Ezra Pound, Aiken, Stevens, and Kreymborg. What is more, the article was followed by poems by all those poets discussed with the exception of Ezra Pound. In volume 2 Gilbert Murray and H. G. Wells wrote of the plans to start a library in the East End under the name of the YMCA Book Room (p. 81). Two Letters in volume 18 may also be mentioned. Walter de la Mare wrote to deny any part in his nephew J. de la Mare Rowley's novel The Passage in Park Lane (p. 523); John Galsworthy, writing as President of the P.E.N. Club announced the formation of a "Society called The Young P.E.N., affiliated to the London P.E.N. Club" (p. 524). Hilaire Belloc reviewed H. G. Wells's The Outline of History in volume 3 (pp. 43-62); H. G. Wells took exception to much in the review and wrote a scathing full-page letter to the editor in answer (p. 313); Belloc ended the little contretemps in LM with a firm but conciliatory letter in the next number (p. 422). 14 Wells wrote and had published five essays against Belloc's "twenty-four voluminous articles" against his Outline of History in a one-shilling book Wells titled Mr. Belloc Objects to "The Outline of History " (1926). I pointed out that seven of Vita Sackville-West's poems originally printed in LM are not included in her Collected Poems of 1933 and that one of de la Mare's is not in his Complete Poems of 1969. Similarly, in order of appearance, poems not included in the latest collections of various poets: Padraic Colum, The Deer of Ireland (7:12); Louis Golding, No Man has Written Poetry Yet (7:130); 15 Walter Savage Landor, To Wordsworth and The Power of Sound (12:62, 63-64); 16 Richard Eberhart, Two Poems: Boulder and Hill Climber (20:238, 239); F. L. Lucas, Four Poems : In a Provincial Museum, The Last of Cynthia (From Propertius), Life and Letters, In the Hebrides (24:391-395); Edith Sitwell, Prelude . For Geoffrey Gorer (32:108-110). 17 John Sullivan states that he limited himself in his G. K. Chesterton: A Bibliography (1958) in the section on Chesterton's "Contributions to Periodicals" to "such writings that I could trace as having appeared in book form, with the addition of a number of items which seemed to me worthy of inclusion for special reasons." He also included a section titled "Books and Periodicals containing Illustrations by G.K. Chesterton" (p. 14). He lists six contributions by Chesterton to LM (p. 145). When a complete bibliography of Chesterton's writings is undertaken, the other contributions to LM that should be noted are The Savage as a Poet (10:288-289), The True Case Against Cliques (17:432-438), The Dean's Last Chapter (30:546-547), and a review of W. R. Inge's Vale . Chesterton provided illustrations for his friend E. Clerihew's verses titled "More Biography for Beginners" in volume 11 (pp. 53, 55). The verses deserve to be quoted: "George the Third / Ought never to have occurred / One can only wonder / At so grotesque a blunder." And, "'Dear me!' exclaimed Homer, / 'What a delicious aroma! / It smells as if a town / Was being burnt down.'" Chesterton's drawings do ample justice to the verses and are not listed in the Sullivan bibliography. Since I have included a review by Chesterton, I should add that there are two reviews by Bertrand Russell not included in the bibliography of his works. 18 Russell reviewed Alfred J. Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic in volume 33 (pp. 541-543) and Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker in volume 36 (pp. 297-298). The bibliography of the works of C. Day-Lewis does not list reviews; that of Russell's does. Whatever other reviews Day-Lewis may have contributed to other periodicals, those he wrote for LM deserve to be known. As, indeed, the reviews written by other authors of any acknowledged importance should. In any event, Day-Lewis wrote eight reviews for R. A. Scott-James, although one would not know of his LM connection from Sean Day-Lewis's C. Day-Lewis: An English Literary Life (1980). 19 Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice were in school together and were much in one another's company thereafter. The curious may wish to compare Day-Lewis's praise of MacNeice, both in the reviews and elsewhere, with some of MacNeice's criticism of Day-Lewis's poetry. In a piece published in 1935 MacNeice, writing about Auden, Spender, and Day-Lewis as "communists and other propagandists," noted that "Day-Lewis, who writes longer and looser works and has not much sense of humour, has committed lamentable ineptitudes while preaching for the cause." Ten years later he described Day-Lewis as "one of the most technically accomplished poets now writing in English." 20 Finally, one review by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch should be mentioned, because it is not listed in his bibliography and because it is of Sir John Squire's Shakespeare and a Dramatist (32:587-589), Sir John still editor of LM . 21</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Chace Act and Anglo-American Literary Relations by James L. W. West III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The long battle in the United States for passage of an international copyright law ended finally in March 1891 with the passage of the Chace Act, the first American international copyright statute. Historians have regarded the bill as a milestone, an indication that the United States was renouncing its stance as an international pirate and was entering into normal copyright relations with other civilized countries. Literary scholars have followed this lead and have assumed that the Chace Act more or less ended the long feud between the intellectual establishments in England and America over international copyright. The reality, as we shall see in this article, was somewhat different. Throughout the nineteenth century American publishers had battened on unauthorized resettings of British books. This practice had robbed British authors of royalties and had placed American authors (who were protected by domestic copyright statutes and thus had to be paid) at an unfair disadvantage in competition with their British counterparts. The situation had been helped somewhat by an arrangement known as "Courtesy of the Trade," an informal agreement among major American book-publishing houses not to poach on each other's British authors. Courtesy of the Trade, however, was only a gentlemen's agreement, and it tended to break down whenever the American book market descended into one of its periodic price wars or whenever the British book in question was a particularly attractive prize. The Chace Act, it has been assumed, now established order and legality in international copyright dealings between British and American publishing houses. Piracy was no longer permitted; American authors could compete on equal footing with British writers; and British writers would no longer be robbed of American royalties. There is some truth to these generalizations, but, as one might suspect, the realities were rather more complex. Certainly it is true that novels by the better-known British writers could no longer be seized immediately by American pirates and manufactured in cheap, shoddy editions for the U.S. market—as was done, for example, with virtually all of Dickens' books. But the provisions of the Chace Act were drawn in such a way that the statute was not a true international copyright law. It by no means granted free access to the American book market for all British publishers. The Chace Act was in fact a relatively restrictive law, especially in its provisions for the manufacture of books eligible for U.S. copyright. In this paper I should like to explore some of the implications of the Chace Act as they played themselves out over the last few years of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth. The Chace Act, as it turns out, had the effect of shielding the American market from British books; also, curiously enough, it protected the British cultural establishment from a backlash effect that might have opened it more fully to American influences and ideas. Finally, for the textual editor, the Chace Act had a strong effect on how some American books were typeset—on their orthography and pointing and their "editing for taste." The key to understanding the influence of the Chace Act is to realize that it contained a "manufacturing clause." The clause read as follows: Provided , That in the case of a book, photograph, chromo, or lithograph, the two copies of the same required to be delivered or deposited [at the Library of Congress for copyright registration] shall be printed from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made therefrom, or from negatives, or drawings on stone made within the limits of the United States, or from transfers made therefrom. 1 Typesetters' unions in America had played a major role in framing the bill and had agreed to support it only if it contained this clause. These unions had feared quite naturally that the American market, if opened entirely to British publishers, would soon be flooded with books which had been typeset in Great Britain. Compositors in the American printing industry (traditionally one of the best-organized groups within the labor force) believed that such a circumstance would rob them of business and jobs. They therefore fought vehemently in congressional copyright hearings for a more restrictive and protective law. They were successful in their arguments: under the Chace Act, the text of a publication had to have been typeset in the United States if it were to secure permanent American copyright. Consequently it was impossible for British publishers to ship their bound or unbound stock, or even their stereotype or electrotype plates, to America and still enjoy the protection of copyright for the publication. Moreover, a customs duty continued to be imposed on books which had been manufactured abroad. The practical effect of the manufacturing clause, and of the customs tariff, was to prevent American publishers from becoming large-scale distributors for books issued by British publishing houses. British publishers had long eyed the vast American book market with envy; clearly they had hoped that international copyright, when it came, would open that market fully to them. That it did not nettled them. Some American publishers were also unhappy about the situation. George Haven Putnam, for example, seems to have wanted a comfortable arrangement under which he and other established American publishers could derive income simply from the distribution of British-printed books in the United States. Putnam found, however, that the voices of the publishers were not the strongest ones in the congressional hearings. He complained later that "the Congressmen had not only called into their councils the representatives of the manufacturing concerns, but had shown themselves more ready to give weight to their arguments and to be guided by their contentions than they were to listen to authors, artists, or composers." 2 The practical effect of the Chace Act was to require American publishers to decide, early in the game, whether they wished to issue a British title in a copyrighted edition in the States. If a British book were apt to do well on the American market, it was necessary to protect it by copyright; this meant that the American publisher had to invest his own capital and have the book manufactured by domestic typesetters and printers. If a British book were expected to sell only moderately well in America, copies could still be imported from the British publisher (or, less frequently, plates could be sent over), but the book, when issued, would be in the public domain. This made both British and American publishers hesitate over marginal titles. The effect over the long term, according to British publisher Stanley Unwin, was that only about five percent of the books published in Great Britain, exclusive of fiction, were also published and copyrighted in separate editions by American publishers. 3 Consignments of other British books, printed from type set in Great Britain, were handled by American publishers and distributors in small quantities, but the numbers were not significant enough to make a very great difference to British houses. Thus the American printing industry was protected from British competition, and the American book market remained relatively inaccessible to British publishers. If he were willing to put his wares on the American market without benefit of copyright, a British publisher could still ship stereos or electros to an American house, but even here there were problems. British plates, according to Haven Putnam, were of inferior quality, and American printers did not like to use them. Putnam writes: While in some departments of book-making English manufacturers still excel their American cousins, the work of plate-making is now done much more effectively in the United States than in England; the improved machinery used here enabling the stereotyper or electrotyper to turn out plates which are uniform and true, and from them the pressman can produce much better work at a less expenditure of labor than from those made by English printers. Indeed, so much extra time is required to "make ready" a form of English plates, that it is generally found more economical in printing from them in this country to run them through the shaving machine, that they may be reduced to some degree of uniformity, before they are put upon the press. 4 British publishers, for their part, did not especially want to go to the trouble of casting duplicate plates and shipping them to America unless sales promised to be substantial. On 8 July 1905, for example, Frederick Macmillan wrote to his brother Maurice that George P. Brett, who headed their American branch in New York City, was unhappy about a recent arrangement over duplicate plates. "I hear that Brett has written to complain of the price we charged him—(2/- a sq inch) for electros," noted Macmillan. "I should not advise that we make any concession on this point. If the result is to make Brett hesitate about asking for electros from our books, I shall be glad." 5 The Chace Act had an effect on British compositors and printers as well. When the measure had first gone into effect in 1891, they had feared that its manufacturing clause might rob them of business. They themselves were unprotected by a similar regulation in Great Britain: their assumption, therefore, was that all books which promised to sell well in both the United States and in Great Britain would be manufactured entirely in America, thus qualifying for copyright in both countries. The British "edition," in such cases, would be a consignment of overrun sheets from the American impression with the British publisher's imprint on the title page. Theoretically the fears of British printers were justified, but, according to publisher William Heinemann, the anticipated difficulties did not emerge. "The manufacturing clause has not materially affected the English printer," he wrote in December 1892; "it has driven only very little of the 'making of books' out of the country, and I believe that this little will—on account of the difficulty of inducing American printers to keep type standing, and also on account of the higher wages paid to compositors on the other side—be still further reduced when English publishers have had longer experience in this experiment." 6 Heinemann proved to be correct: the Chace Act never did redirect much printing business from Great Britain to America. The difficulties of overseeing, from London, the setting and printing of a book in New York or Philadelphia, and of orchestrating an American production schedule with a British promotion and distribution campaign—these challenges were too much for most British publishers to undertake. Better to have their editions manufactured by their own domestic printers and let the American market take care of itself. The only British publishers to benefit markedly from the Chace Act were those who had offices on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, John Lane, founder of The Bodley Head, used the new law to considerable advantage. He opened a New York branch in 1896; thereafter, any of his titles with potential for both the British and American markets were manufactured in the United States and copyrighted in Washington, while overrun sheets were sent to England, bound there, and copyrighted for the British market. Lane thus avoided the expense of a separate British typesetting. The procedure, however, could have a peculiar effect on the text of an American author. As an example we might consider the case of Theodore Dreiser. Lane signed Dreiser to his list after Dreiser fell out with Harper &amp; Brothers over The Titan in 1914. Thereafter Dreiser's publisher in both America and England was Lane. Oddly, this meant that his typescripts began to be edited, in New York, by a British editor. The rationale was obvious: if the text were to be printed only once, for both markets, it had to conform sufficiently well to British orthography, usage, and taste to be acceptable to readers in "the home country." One sees evidence of this kind of editing, for example, on the typescript setting-copy of Dreiser's novel The "Genius" , published by Lane in 1915. Dreiser's editor for the novel was the Englishman Frederic Chapman, and the typescript of The "Genius" is heavily marked by his red pen. Chapman introduces much phrasing that is British in feel; he is also alert for expressions that an Englishman might find vulgar. Thus, for example, the character Carlotta, who is described by Dreiser as a "sex enthusiast," becomes (more mildly) a woman who is "passion driven." Or, to give only one other instance from many that are available in the typescript, "advertising solicitors" become "advertising canvassers" to avoid confusion over the British usage of the term "solicitor." Dreiser and Chapman frequently spar in the margins over American slang, for which Chapman seems to have had little appreciation. Often he writes such comments as "quite meaningless to an English ear" or "incomprehensible, to an Englishman at any rate." Dreiser usually gives in and revises. Probably he was not happy over this treatment of his text, but he had no real choice, given the copyright laws under which his publisher was operating. 7 A somewhat less severe effect of the Chace Act was to impose a modified system of British spelling on many books that were manufactured in the United States. American readers, as a rule, seem not to have been particularly sensitive to British orthography and usage. Thus it appears to have had little effect on the reception or sales of a book in America if it were printed from British plates or were composed of overrun British sheets. (Such books were not protected by U.S. copyright, as noted earlier.) The reverse, however, was not true: British reviewers and readers apparently did complain if books with American spelling and usage were sold to them in British bookstores. American literary agents, who did a good bit of transatlantic business, were very much aware of the problem. New York agent Paul Revere Reynolds, writing to publisher Henry Holt in March 1897, for example, specified that a book destined for joint American/British publication "must be set with English spelling ." Reynolds added, "This is absolutely essential as Heinemann is not willing to take a book except on those conditions. Otherwise English reviewers slash a book and hurt its sale." 8 The net effect of such attitudes was to require American publishers to have some of their books typeset in a style of British orthography known as "modified Oxford spelling." If there were a pre-publication arrangement for sale of the American-set text in Great Britain—or even if there were only a chance of such a sale—then the American publisher would employ this system of anglicized spelling, or one very like it. Such forms as to-day and to-morrow would usually be introduced, along with theatre and centre and catalogue . Some words ending in - or would be rendered with - our , such as colour and glamour , and the middle e in acknowledgement would be retained. Punctuation would follow American practices for the most part: periods would appear after Mr. and Mrs. , and double quotation marks would be employed in dialogue. Commas or periods would be set inside the closing quotation marks, but there would be a spattering of hyphenated words throughout that in ordinary American usage would appear as a single word or as two separate words. This style of typesetting was imposed on the texts of a great many American writers of the nineteen-teens and -twenties, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ellen Glasgow, Ernest Hemingway, and Willa Cather. Original manuscripts survive for most of these writers, and editors can deduce from these documents each author's habits of spelling (or, in Fitzgerald's case, misspelling). But in the instance of Cather, we have very few original manuscripts because she destroyed them, along with much of her correspondence, before her death. At the very least, knowledge of the effects of the Chace Act on the typesetting of her novels might cause editors to cast a skeptical eye on the British spellings in her first editions, even if these editions were perforce to be used as copytexts for a scholarly re-editing of her novels. The Chace Act had significant effects on British writers as well, and those effects were quite often unfavorable. Perhaps it would be best to begin with those authors least damaged by the 1891 statute. These were established British writers whose new works were sure to be manufactured and copyrighted in the States. Of course the Chace Act did nothing to protect their previously published writings, a serious matter for some of the great Victorian authors who were nearing the ends of their careers. The great bulk of John Ruskin's work, for example, continued to be pirated in America; publisher George Allen, to his consternation, was able to enjoy the full protection of American copyright on only one Ruskin book— Verona, and Her Rivers , a collection of old lectures which appeared in 1893. 9 Many of the other great Victorian writers suffered similarly under the new law. One possible tactic for established British writers was to bring old books up to date and copyright the revised editions in America. There was a section of the Chace Act which permitted such a strategem: That the alterations, revisions, and additions made to books by foreign authors, heretofore published, of which new additions shall appear subsequently to the taking effect of this act, shall be held and deemed capable of being copyrighted as above provided for in this act, unless they form a part of the series in course of publication at the time this act shall take effect. [Chace Act, Sec. 4959] British publishers of such revised editions quickly learned that their authors were fully aware of these new benefits of the Chace Act. With copyright secure in the U.S., these authors could demand higher royalties on American sales. James Bryce, for example, whose book The American Commonwealth was one of the steadiest sellers for Macmillan in the States, began to press for higher returns on a newly revised edition. Frederick Macmillan added this postscript to a 10 December 1891 letter to George P. Brett in New York: "I am sorry to say Mr Bryce has been demanding an increased royalty on the American copies of his book. We don't want to give him anything more if we can possibly help it; but I dare say in view of the new Copyright Bill he and other English authors will do what they can to squeeze the publishers." 10 The British authors most seriously damaged by the manufacturing clause were young writers who were as yet without reputation in America. In order to secure U.S. copyright for the books of these authors, American publishers ideally had to decide before publication to have the texts set and printed in the States. For unknown authors, however, this was impractical and financially risky. If, therefore, a book blossomed late in England and an author's potential on the American market were consequently recognized only after a small consignment of British-set copies had been imported and sold in the States, then there was no way ever to secure copyright for that writing in America. The author's early work was in public domain, available to any publisher. Even if the author had a subsequent copyrighted success in the U.S., his early writing remained unprotected and was sure to be pirated. Anthony Hope Hawkins explained the problem in an 1896 letter to S. S. McClure: "Ever since the date of the Act, it is practically impossible for beginners over here to secure copyright in your country. . . . The result is that the earlier (and probably less capable) stories are at the mercy of the first comer. The author has no power of selecting what he will or will not reprint. . . . So, far from 'forcing unworthy stories' on the American public, he is himself forced to stand by and see all that he wrote pitchforked on to the market." 11 The alternative frequently followed after 1891 was to withhold the writing of promising young British authors from the American market—to be scrupulous about not permitting even a token shipment of British-set copies to be sent to America. But this, of course, denied the beginning author the chance to build a modest initial following in the States, the kind of following which might justify later, properly copyrighted editions of his writings. A 1909 revision of the Chace Act changed matters slightly by introducing the concept of ad interim copyright. If a work in the English language, manufactured outside the United States, were deposited in Washington within thirty days of its appearance abroad, it received ad interim protection for a further thirty days, during which time an American edition might be set, printed, bound, and copyrighted by the usual methods. The basic manufacturing clause remained in effect for English-language books typeset in Great Britain, however, and it continued to irritate both British and American publishers. Henry Holt called the 1909 revision "infernally narrow," and Haven Putnam considered it "defective, inconsistent, and inadequate." British publishers in general found the statute to be frankly discriminatory against them. 12 Holt, the Putnams, the Scribners, the Dodds, and other American publishers of the period believed that U.S. international copyright laws restrained free intellectual intercourse in order to satisfy the demands of the unionized laboring classes. Undoubtedly they were correct. But with hindsight one can see that the Chace Act, with its manufacturing clause, did have some side effects which might be considered beneficial. American compositors, without intending to do so, had put a protective barrier of sorts around the American intellectual establishment. Publishers in the United States were encouraged by the Chace Act to cultivate their own territories and resources, and to publish books by their own scientists, historians, philosophers, and fiction-writers. Relatively few titles from the British market would justify the risk of a fresh American edition. Marginal British publications were imported only in small quantities or were kept off the United States market altogether. In this way the manufacturing clause in the Chace Act played a role in America's cultural and literary severance from Great Britain after 1900. It can also be argued, again with hindsight, that the manufacturing clause was probably good for the development of British intellectual life during the twentieth century. If the trade in books between Great Britain and the United States had been unrestricted, British scientists and humanists would— initially, at least—have exercised a dominating influence over American education and culture. But eventually the cumulative power of the American market, so much larger and more various than the British market, would almost surely have begun to work in reverse. British publishers would have had to consider tastes and interests in the United States as an important factor (perhaps as the most important factor) in many publishing decisions, and British authors would have felt this same pressure. Without the temptation of the American market, and with the stability in prices brought about by the Net Book Agreement after 1900, British publishers could continue to do business in the old way—publishing books by their own native intellectuals and writers and selling them primarily in Great Britain and in the commonwealth markets of Australia, India, and Canada. 13 The Chace Act, then, had a mixed effect on Anglo-American literary relations. It did end the worst forms of international piracy, but it was a source of irritation to many British and American publishers. Books typeset in America for distribution both in the U.S. and Britain retained an overlay of British orthography and usage and had to conform to British standards of propriety. American publishers had to decide early on whether to copyright British works in the States by having them typeset here. British authors, especially fledgling ones, could still see their works appear in America without the protection of copyright. Older British writers still had no way to recover U.S. copyright on their earlier writings. The only recompense for all of these groups was that their intellectual establishments were inadvertently protected from one another. But that was a beneficial side effect apparent only in hindsight—a democratic influence on culture which De Tocqueville would have understood, but which he could not have predicted.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Henry James and the Atlantic Monthly : Editorial Perspectives on James' "Friction with the Market" by Ellery Sedgwick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1864, the year he committed himself to the profession of authorship, Henry James sent his friend Thomas Sergeant Perry a sketch of an editor of the Atlantic Monthly kneeling before a masterful and confident author who looks down on the editor's supplications with dignified calm. "One of these days," wrote James, "we shall have certain persons on their knees , imploring for contributions" (28 Oct. 1864, Anesko frontispiece). At the beginning of his career, James, like William Dean Howells and several other young writers of what would soon become America's first substantial generation of professional authors of fiction, saw the Atlantic as representing the market that he would need to conquer to gain credibility, an audience, and a livelihood. James' career reflects how closely the rise of post-war literary professionalism was tied to the rise of the "quality" monthly magazines. Michael Anesko has demonstrated that until 1900, the substantial majority of James' income derived not from book sales but from payments by American periodicals (168, 175, 167-197). James played the periodical market astutely, often writing in response to the specific solicitation of editors, sometimes intentionally adapting to the requirements of periodical audiences or editors, and consciously stimulating competition for his work. He published in all of the quality magazines. But the Atlantic , with its high literary tradition and relatively small circulation, accepted his first fiction, solicited his contributions regularly for twenty-five years, and published far more of the major work than what James referred to as the "New York picture books," the larger-circulation New York illustrated monthlies like Harper's, Scribner's , and The Century . Until the mid-eighties James met with rising success in the American periodical market, but after that American monthlies, eventually including the Atlantic , increasingly failed to support his work. This failure was caused partly by the evolution of James' later style, but also in large part by changes in the magazine market for fiction. This paper examines those changes in the literary market and its treatment of James from the perspective of six successive Atlantic editors. James' approximately forty years of active publishing in periodicals spanned the Atlantic editorships of James T. Fields (1861-71), W. D. Howells (1871-81), T. B. Aldrich (1881-90), Horace Scudder (1890-98), Walter H. Page (1898-99), and Bliss Perry (1899-1908). Before 1890, Atlantic editors were, if not suppliant, at least consistently receptive to James' work, supporting it with frequent publication as well as highly sympathetic reviews. From the beginning, James did experience a mild aesthetic "friction" with Fields and even with Howells. But they, like Aldrich, solicited him regularly for both fiction and nonfiction, praised his work, and were eager to identify him with the magazine. Beginning in 1890, however, the Atlantic's editors, while generally acknowledging James' stature as a literary master who would rank permanently with the great novelists in English, were increasingly evasive and hesitant to publish his fiction. Over the next fifteen years, as James' work became increasingly subtle, it encountered growing resistance from Atlantic editors, who for both commercial and ideological reasons were consciously attempting to survive in the new climate of "progressive" publishing by closing the gap between literature and journalism, between highbrow and middle-class popular culture. James' entrance into the Atlantic seems to have been astonishingly easy compared to that of most contemporaries. While Howells and other young aspirants experienced frequent rejections or requests for revision, there is no evidence that James ever suffered these. On the contrary, from his earliest years as a writer, the Atlantic gave him ready acceptance and a fairly liberal scope for aesthetic experiment and development. Clearly Howells, who became Fields' assistant in March 1866 at the age of 29, played a major role in the magazine's publication of seven stories and two three-number novellas by James during Fields' editorship. Fields himself, however, had printed James' first published fiction, "The Story of a Year," as the lead piece in March 1865, an unusual distinction for a new writer, and had followed it with another in February 1866 before Howells arrived at the Atlantic . James' personal and family connections with influential members of intellectual Cambridge like James Russell Lowell and Charles Eliot Norton probably facilitated initial access to the Atlantic as well as the North American and the Nation . But both Fields and the Atlantic readership were inclined to be more receptive than other American audiences of the time towards the realistic and anti-conventional tendencies of James' early fiction. From its inception, the Atlantic , first under Lowell (1857-1861), then under Fields, had consciously opposed the prevailing literary didacticism and sentimentality and supported the early development of American regionalism and realism (Brodhead 474; Donovan 6; McMahon 100; Mott 2: 173 and 3: 501). Howells was being accurate as well as generous when he later wrote: "I could not claim there was anything original in my passion for the common, for the familiar and the low. . . . Lowell had the same passion for it in the intervals of his 'toryism of the nerves' and nobody could have tasted its raciness with a keener gusto than my chief [Fields]" ("Recollections" 600). Fields demonstrated his taste for various experiments in American realism by publishing works such as Rebecca Harding Davis' "Life in the Iron Mills" and "A Story of Today," some of Mrs. Stowe's "Old Town Stories," and Howells' "Suburban Sketches," as well as James' earliest fiction, which consciously experimented with breaking the conventional patterns and morality of sentimental literature. Fields, however, was not only the editor who brought the Atlantic to its highest 19th-century circulation (50,000) but also perhaps the most successful American publisher of his generation, in part because his own tastes mirrored those of a relatively broad audience. He was also a hearty, sanguine selfmade man of an older generation whose patterns for realism were Dickens and Thackeray, rather than George Eliot (on whom James wrote a highly sympathetic early Atlantic article in 1866). James later recalled, with amusing embellishment, that Fields, after publishing several of James' stories, began to hint that he found the young author "precociously dismal" and to warn against his dispiriting endings. According to James, Fields communicated to Howells his amusement that "such a strain of pessimism in the would-be picture of life had an odd, had even a ridiculous air on the part of an author with his mother's milk scarce yet dry on his lips." This amusement Howells quickly shared with James (James, "Fields," 27). The limits of Fields' taste for pessimism and irony became a running joke between Howells and James. Inevitably, these young Turks of the next generation of realists amusingly magnified the literary limitations of the editor who very substantively supported both at the beginning of their careers, as he had consistently supported the deeply pessimistic Hawthorne. Howells wrote to James: "'What we want,' says Mr. Fields with perfect truth, 'is short, cheerful stories.' And our experience of you is quite in that way of fiction" ( Letters 1: 352). Despite this claim, however, there is no evidence that Fields, who had the final say on virtually everything that went into his Atlantic , rejected any of James' stories or that he requested or influenced James to modify any specific work. The last of James' stories Fields published, "A Passionate Pilgrim" (March-April 1871), was typically neither short nor cheerful: Clement Searle dies (possibly of syphilis) just as the girl becomes free to marry him. Fields was genially tolerant, but Howells was a sympathetic contemporary and co-conspirator. His quick accession to editorial power, culminating in his succession as editor-in-chief in July 1871, gave James virtually unlimited access to the Atlantic . James later recalled both the delicious exhilaration of having a friend who was also an editor and the confidence Howells gave him: You held out your open editorial hand to me at the time I began to write—and I allude especially to the summer of 1866—with a frankness and a sweetness of hospitality that was really the making of me, the making of confidence that required help and sympathy. . . . [Y]ou wrote to me, and confessed yourself struck with me—I have never forgotten the beautiful thrill of that. You published me at once—and paid me, above all, with a dazzling promptitude. . . . [Y]ou talked to me and listened to me. . . . ("Open Letter" 558-559) Howells recalled that when Fields in 1867 sent him a copy of James' "Poor Richard" asking his recommendation on publishing it, he had responded: "Yes, and all the stories you can get from the writer" ("James" 25). While perceptive from the beginning about the quality and originality of James' work, Howells was perceptive too about James' problems in developing an audience among readers habituated to the conventional expectations created by the fiction of writers like Mrs. Southworth and Josiah Holland. Howells wrote to Charles Eliot Norton: "I cannot doubt that James has every element of success in fiction. But I suspect that he must in a very great degree create his audience. In the meantime, I rather despise existing readers" (10 Aug. 1867, Letters 1: 283). Among these readers, he undoubtedly sometimes numbered his "chief." Throughout his own editorship Howells was plagued by a decline in readership from 50,000 in 1869 to under 20.000 in the late seventies, due largely to the increasing popularity of the New York illustrated magazines, especially the immediately successful Scribner's (later The Century ) begun in 1871. Howells, willing to a degree to resist and "educate" his readers' tastes, took every opportunity to expose the Atlantic audience to James' work (Ballou 213). During the early seventies, he agreed to publish a piece by James every month if one was available (10 March 1873) and during his decade as editor the Atlantic carried thirty-one short stories, reviews, or travel pieces, two short novels, and three major serials: Roderick Hudson (1875), The American (1876-77), and The Portrait of a Lady (1880-81). Howells' editorial relationship with James was mainly generative, admiring and encouraging rather than prescriptive. Howells tended to edit manuscripts heavily, but he was restrained in editing or advising James. It was William James, not Howells, who on seeing proofs of The American already reviewed by Howells found some phrases "so shocking as to make the reader's flesh creep," and asked Howells, with Henry's permission, to remove them (18 Dec. 1876 in James' Letters 2: 84). Howells did, however, express his infamous hope that Newman, the American, would be allowed to marry Claire de Cintré despite the opposition of her cynical and ruthless family. This suggestion was ironic in the face of his conspiratorial jokes with James over Fields' taste for cheerful resolutions. Also, Howells' own Atlantic novel, A Chance Acquaintance (1873), had ended with an "evaporated" relationship between a culturally incompatible Miles Arbuton and Kitty Ellison which he had vigorously defended on the basis of its realism. Howells' willingness to resist his readers had limits, but he also felt a genuine concern for James' cultivation of his audience. James, of course, refused to throw the "rather vulgar sop to readers who don't really know the world and who don't measure the merit of a novel by its correspondence to the same." The predictable critical and public outcry of betrayed confidence followed. (See, for example, Scribner's July 1877, 406-407.) James, however, in a less-quoted section of the letter to Howells defending the integrity of his ending, responded to this friction with the market by promising the editor "the brightest possible sun-spot for the four number tale of 1878 . . . a very joyous little romance" and proceeded to outline his idea for The Europeans (30 March 1877, Letters 2:105). By the mid-seventies, James had grown adept at producing "sun spots" and "small potboilers" as he called them and was publishing them in several of the American monthlies. From his first publication, James had had a distinctly modern sense of himself as a literary professional whose aim was to make a full livelihood from writing, in contrast with his father's genteel intellectual dilletantism or Hawthorne's struggle to support himself with patronage jobs while laboring in obscurity. Such an aim was possible, of course, mainly because of the steady increase after 1850 of "quality" literary monthlies. As Anesko argues, James both manipulated the magazine market and responded to its demands, building an audience and earning a livelihood by seeking a "middle way" between a prostituted popularity and an esoteric aestheticism that would leave him unread (8). By the middle of Howells' editorship, James had become practiced at playing the magazine market. The rise of the quality New York illustrated magazines during the seventies and eighties, aimed at a broader, generally less liberally educated or intellectual middle-class audience than the Atlantic's , seemed to offer a considerably wider field, although James was generally to find that the larger the readership a magazine aimed at, the more difficulty he had sustaining its interest in his work. Since 1866, he had published occasional stories in the Galaxy , New York's lively, short-lived answer to the Atlantic ; Howells had encouraged him to do so to expand his readership (letter to James, 26 June 1869, Howells Letters 1: 328). But by 1874, Howells and the Atlantic were experiencing strong competition from the new, lavishly illustrated Scribner's for both readers and authors, including James. In fact, it was Scribner's editor, Howells' old antagonist, the sentimental novelist and moralist Dr. Josiah Holland, and not Howells, who in early 1874 first fired James up with the prospect of serializing a full novel (James to parents, 9 March 1874, and to Howells, 10 March 1874; Letters 1: 434-437). Acting from a convenient combination of personal obligation to Howells and self-interest, James notified Howells of Holland's offer. Initiating the pattern that would henceforth characterize his relationships with the magazines, James made it clear that there was competition for his work, that to meet his financial needs he must use several sources of publication, and that rather than being bound by either "trade courtesy" or personal friendship, publication was to be "a pure money question" (to Howells, 9 Jan. and 10 March 1874; Letters 1: 424, 436-437). As a result, Howells had to bid for both Roderick Hudson and The American while James published shorter works in Scribner's, Harper's , and the Galaxy and experimented with the less prestigious magazines like Lippincott's . Also, James' payments from the Atlantic rapidly rose from $100 per number for Roderick Hudson in 1875 to $250 per number (about $15 a page) in 1880 for Portrait of a Lady with permission to publish it simultaneously in England in Macmillan's . When Thomas Bailey Aldrich succeeded Howells to the Atlantic editorship in February 1881, James wrote to T.S.Perry: "I . . . congratulate Howells and commiserate Aldrich. . . . As for Aldrich, he seems to me good enough for the Atlantic and the Atlantic good enough for him" (16 Feb. 1881, Letters 2: 341). James, flush with two years of popular success following "Daisy Miller" and with consciously popularized short sequences like Confidence in Scribner's and Washington Square "simultaning" in Harper's and Cornhill , was irritated at the Yankee financial conservatism of the Atlantic 's new publisher, Henry Oscar Houghton (to Henry James Sr., 19 April 1878, Letters 2: 166). He was also scathingly contemptuous of Aldrich, whom he considered an intellectual lightweight: "the great little T. B. Aldrich" surrounded by a "queer atmosphere of travel, luxury, and purchase" (quoted in Ballou 354). As it turned out, James would receive a major part of his income as well as solid editorial and critical support during a difficult decade from Aldrich, Houghton, and the Atlantic . John Tomsich has claimed that the cultural leaders of the genteel tradition, prominently including Aldrich, repudiated James as too depressing and therefore were "always insensitive to the greatest American artist of their day" (189). Aldrich's editorial treatment of James during the eighties, as well as Horace Scudder's reviews in the Atlantic , flatly contradict this conclusion. In fact, Aldrich's conservative aestheticism and his acceptance during his editorship of the Atlantic 's position as a small-circulation defender of high culture made the Boston magazine a haven for James' major work at a time when the New York illustrated monthlies with far larger circulations and broader readerships were backing away from him. If James in the early eighties was flush with success, the Atlantic was in distinct decline. While Harper's and the new Scribner's claimed circulations well over 100,000 and by mid-decade the Century boasted 210,000 and "still rising," the more austere, old-fashioned Boston organ was clearly losing the competition for popular authors like Twain and ex-editor Howells and for a broad spectrum of middle-class readers. Atlantic circulation continued to decline from around 20,000 in 1880 to nearer 12,000 in 1885 (Ballou 365 and Houghton Mifflin Cost Book 12). Portrait , while a critical success and reasonably profitable in book form, had not helped circulation of the Atlantic , which had paid $3500 to serialize it, partly because copies of Macmillan's , which had paid only $1580 to carry each installment a month earlier, were available in the United States before the corresponding Atlantic number was issued. Houghton henceforth ruled out all simultaneous publication, and as Portrait finished its 14-month run in the fall of 1881, Aldrich declined James' proposal for another serial to be "simultaned" at the increased price of $300 per number. But when Aldrich went on his annual summer excursion to Europe in 1882, Houghton apparently gave him "carte blanche" to negotiate major contributions from James (Ballou 289). Houghton's unusual liberality in this case was almost certainly motivated by his desire to keep James from entering an exclusive contract with his ex-partner, James Osgood, from whom he had parted in bitterness and who was now successfully raiding several publishers to secure major authors such as Twain, Howells, and Cable. Osgood was also in Europe this summer, and James again experienced the pleasure and profit of being the object of a bidding war. Aldrich, whom James derisively described as "that gilded youth who edits periodicals from Brown's Hotel," duly reported to Houghton that "after a great deal of diplomacy and Old Port, combined with several attacks on Henry James in his bathtub, I have secured the dramatization of 'Daisy Miller' for the Atlantic . I think it is a great card" (James quoted in Ballou 354, and Aldrich to Houghton, Sept. 1882, in Ballou 363). Certainly James had realized his youthful ambition to have "certain persons" on their knees begging for contributions. Even better, those persons were offering substantial money. Aldrich and Houghton got their "great card" at the very steep price of $1000, about $18 a page. The "great card" proved a losing gamble and initiated a longstanding Atlantic policy against publishing dramatic literature. But Aldrich continued to solicit whatever he could get from James. By 1882, however, James had contracted with Houghton's arch-rival Osgood for both magazine and book rights to a novel and several stories. All Aldrich got for 1883 and 1884 was a long series of French travel sketches and miscellaneous critical essays. Even aside from his personal animosity with Houghton, the high-rolling Osgood had more ambitious plans for James' fiction. Osgood's plan, as well as James' own ability to capitalize on the competition, and perhaps on the Houghton-Osgood animosity, was revealed in James' response to Aldrich's solicitation of a novel for 1885: Paris, Feb. 13 [1884] Yes—I think I should like to do you a serial to begin in 1865 [sic]. . . . Between this and that, the Century is to publish, de moi, 1/ a story in three parts. 2/ a story in two parts. 3/ a story in six parts [ The Bostonians ]. And three or four short tales, from my turning hand, are to appear (this is a profound secret)—have been, in a word, secured, a prix d'or in—je vous en donne en mille—the New York Sunday Sun!! This last fact, I repeat, is really as yet a complete and sacred secret . Please bury it in oblivion and burn my letter. I mention it, with the preceding items, simply to denote that by July 1865 [sic] I expect to be in the enjoyment of a popularity which will require me to ask $500 a number for the successive instalments of The Princess Casamassima (which will probably be the name of my novel, though on this I am not yet fixed). ( Letters 3: 25) The Century now claimed a circulation over 200,000 and Charles Dana's Sun over 130,000. Both represented a much broader audience than the Atlantic and paid on a more liberal scale, Dana paying well over $40 a page for two stories by James (Ballou 376). But James was never again to enjoy this degree of confidence in his ability to win a popular American audience and command its financial rewards. Rather than bringing the expected popularity, the next several years brought the bankruptcy of the lavish Osgood in 1885, a resulting severe financial loss for James that put him under increased financial pressure, a very mediocre critical reception of his major works, a declining overall income, and a sharply diminished editorial demand, especially for full-length serials. On receipt of James' letter requesting $500 per installment for his next novel, Aldrich responded that while he was much interested in the serial, Houghton would not pay what seemed an exceptionally high price. James, in a less ebullient mood, replied that on reconsideration his demand did seem "offhand and undigested," even "inconsiderate." He must, he claimed, have been thinking of the total he received from simultaneous English and American serializations of the Portrait which together yielded about $500. His more "deliberate," "digested," and final proposal was for his recent rate of $15 a page, which would bring about $350 a number for a twelve-month serial, compared with $250 for Portrait (19 March 1884, Letters 3: 37-38, 89). James' original proposal had probably been based not so much on misremembering the simultaning of the Portrait as on a conscious testing of the Atlantic 's upper limits in light of his recent successes, the competition of Osgood and Houghton, and the resulting windfall he had had from Houghton for the play of "Daisy Miller." At any rate, Aldrich and Houghton accepted James' counterproposal; and James made $4550 from serial rights for the Princess , in part because, like virtually all of James' full serials, it ran longer than projected and Aldrich and Houghton insisted on paying James the full rate for the numbers not in the original contract (Anesko 190). Both The Bostonians , which ran in the Century from February 1885 to February 1886, and the Princess ( Atlantic , Sept. 1885-Oct. 1886) proved unpopular with most reviewers and readers. The Bostonians provoked a brief, lively scandal over James' satirical portrait of the indefatigably idealistic reformer Elizabeth Peabody in the dotty, pathetic Miss Birdseye. But after this notoriety, James feared that the book would be "a fiasco, as not a word, echo or comment on the serial . . . have come to me . . . from any quarter whatever. This deathly silence seems to indicate that it has fallen flat. I hoped much of it, and shall be disappointed" (to William James, Oct. 1885, Letters 3: 102). To the end of his life, James recalled with bitterness the response of R. W. Gilder, the Century 's editor, who confirmed James' fears by telling him frankly that "they had never published anything that appeared so little to interest their readers" (James to E. Gosse, 25 Aug. 1915, Letters 4: 778). The Bostonians was the first and last full novel James published in The Century . The dominant note in American critical response to both serials was anticipated in William James' warning to his brother that he risked "turning away the great majority of readers who crave more matter with less art" (May 1886 in Gard 160). Mark Twain swore that he would rather be "damned to John Bunyan's heaven" than suffer the tedium of reading The Bostonians (to Howells, July 1885, Gard 156). The Critic's representative review of The Princess Casamassima called it an interminable tale that could appeal only to "the lover of . . . emotions analytically examined, of hair radiantly split, of spectroscopic ratings capable of dividing a ray of light into 32,000 lines to the square inch, or of intellectual engines describing 50,000 sensations to the twenty pages" (29 Jan. 1887, 51-52). For a year and a half after the Princess finished its run in the Atlantic , only one short story by James was published in a periodical. From 1872 through 1884, James' income, most of it from American periodicals, had risen steadily, but it now entered a clear downward trend that was sustained until 1895 (Anesko 175, 176, 190). Further, with the Princess , he had tried for but failed to achieve a higher rate of payment, and now his rate, which had steadily advanced as a result of competition, entered a stasis that lasted for the rest of his life. By December 1887, he was lamenting to Edmund Gosse that editors as well as the public had lost confidence in him, and in February 1888 he wrote in his well-known letter to Howells that he was "still staggering a good deal under the mysterious and (to me) inexplicable injury wrought—apparently—upon my situation by my two last novels, the Bostonians and the Princess , from which I expected so much and derived so little. They have reduced the desire, and the demand, for my productions to zero" (Anesko 128; to Howells 2 Jan. 1888, Letters 3: 209). By 1888, the adverse reception of the Princess and The Bostonians had strongly influenced James temporarily to abandon the full-length novel in favor of short stories and brief serials. In a letter to Robert Louis Stevenson, James explained his wish to "leave a multitude of pictures of my time . . . going in for number as well as quality . . ." ( Letters 3: 240). But this shift of aesthetic focus from novel to story was also very clearly influenced by his extreme disappointment at the reception of his recent serial novels and by a magazine market indifferent, even hostile, to his longer work, yet still open to occasional shorter fiction. As Leon Edel demonstrates, James in 1887 and 1888 continued producing a number of short pieces, a few of which would be published soon in the illustrated New York monthlies. But solicitation of his work had, in fact, sharply diminished, and none of the large-circulation periodicals was inquiring about a major, full-length work. Aldrich and Houghton, however, essentially beaten in the competition for more popular writers like Twain and Howells, still viewed him as an important contributor, financially accessible as well as appropriate to the Atlantic 's support for literary quality and its relatively highbrow audience. Shortly after James' despairing letter to Howells, Aldrich began publishing the three-number serial "The Aspern Papers" and laid siege to James for a major serial novel for 1889. In July 1887, in the absence of offers for serials, James had confided to Grace Norton that he was beginning to think of "a novel about half as long (thank God!) as the Princess " to be published as a volume without periodical serialization ( Letters 3: 198). In his discouragement with longer fiction and turning to shorter pieces, he seems not, however, to have begun work on the idea. Aldrich's solicitation changed his plans considerably. It provided a new focus for the major work of his next two years as well as one-third to two-thirds of his literary income each year between 1888-1890: I succumb to your arguments and will undertake to manage a serial for the full twelvemonth of 1889. It shall be seventeen or eighteen pages—with the option of rising, au besoin , to twenty—and shall be paid for at the same rate as the Princess —i.e. $15 per page. . . . 1st.—To compass this end (I mean the end of giving you a longer rather than a shorter serial)—I shall probably run two stories (i.e. two subjects I have had in my head) together, interweaving their threads. But equally probably the thing will bear the name I gave you: "The Tragic Muse." (3 March 1888, Letters 3: 223) The Tragic Muse was the last novel James would write for a decade, and when he returned to novels he would virtually give up serializing them because there was no market. Its central theme, reflecting James' own frustration in developing a substantial readership, was the conflict between the integrity of the artist and the public world, including "the essentially brutal nature of the modern audience" (Anesko 137, Tragic Muse 72). In integrating his two plots around this theme to meet Aldrich's request, James had worse than usual problems corsetting what Howells had called his "buxom muse." Despite James' reprimanding himself in his notebooks that he had begun "too complacently illustrative and descriptive" and must compress to gain "rapidity and action," the Muse ran on unflaggingly past the contracted twelve installments to fully seventeen, netting James almost $5000 for the serial rights (Anesko 125). Aldrich, while concerned at the constant requirement to curtail other material, was highly accommodating. Horace Scudder, chief Atlantic reviewer and soon to succeed Aldrich as Atlantic editor, countered in his review the widespread criticism of James' verbal abundance by asserting that it was the "lavishness of true art, not the prodigality of a spendthrift of words." He concluded that "we can only advise students of literature and art who wish to see how fine a thing may be presented with a technique which . . . proves to be the facile instrument of a master workman who is thinking of the soul of his art to read The Tragic Muse " (Sept. 1890, 419-422). Scudder's reviews of James during the decade had been consistently sympathetic, though not uncritical, and Aldrich had published work by James, including three major novels, in 66 of the 111 issues he edited. Clearly Aldrich's Atlantic , representing a relatively small cultural minority and an editorial pride in resisting commercial incursions on aesthetic quality, had continued to support the production of major work by the most important novelist of his day at a time when others had retreated. During the next decade, however, as the magazine became gradually more progressive and ambitious, Atlantic editors would cease to besiege James in his bathtub and ply him with old port. When Houghton asked Horace Scudder to replace Aldrich in 1890, Scudder had written in his diary: "My aim is to keep the magazine at the front of American literature . . . and my heart beats quicker at the thought of serving God in this cause of high, pure literature" (17 June 1890). But Scudder was aware that he was "taking the magazine at a time when it is running down financially" and that his employers, who blamed part of this running down on Aldrich's stance of aesthetic indifference to commercial prospects, expected him to reverse the decline. As the Atlantic 's major critic of American fiction, he had sometimes questioned James' elaborate psychological "vivisection" at the expense of "surface event" but consistently praised James as the contemporary master craftsman both in the short story and the novel. As a trade book editor, however, he was well aware that, except for Portrait , James' books with Houghton Mifflin had sold very poorly. The Tragic Muse would not even sell out its edition of 1000 during its first decade. He was conscious too that both Howells and Aldrich had agonized over unsuccessful efforts to contain James' buxom muse. Even more importantly, he knew that the firm's younger partner, George Mifflin, now coming into increasing control, considered the record seventeen installments of The Tragic Muse as so many millstones around the magazine's neck (Ballou 626, n. 20). These were the forces that would create Scudder's friction with James. In 1890, with the Muse finishing its marathon run, Scudder decided not to solicit another serial from James. The Atlantic was belatedly joining the other quality magazines in being wary of James' longer fiction. But Scudder still wanted James substantively represented in the magazine and requested four short stories instead. "The new editor of the Atlantic ," he assured the novelist, "values your work highly," and he sent as evidence his appreciative review of the Muse (20 Aug. 1890). James, genuinely appreciative of this authoritative tribute after years of exasperation with American editors, responded that the review "really brought tears to my eyes—giving me a luxurious sense of being understood, perceived, felt." To Scudder's proposal he replied, "I embrace it with enthusiasm. . . . I will do the very best I can for you; I appreciate the friendly quality of your hospitality" (30 Aug. 1890, Ballou, 446). Scudder's response to the first story quickly terminated James' "luxurious sense of being understood" at last by an American editor. In a lament echoed by thousands of James' later readers, Scudder apologetically suggested that "The Pupil" lacked "vivid surface" incident. "I do not need to tell you how much I admire your best work," Scudder wrote. "The Atlantic has been hospitable and its doors are wide open to you now. . . . [But] frankly my reluctant judgment insists upon regarding the story as lacking in interest, in precision, and in effectiveness. . . . I hate to write all this, but I should hate myself still more if I didn't" (30 Oct. 1890). James was stunned. He had not received a rejection from the Atlantic for twenty-five years, and although he was irritated by its rate of pay, he had considered it a safe haven. "I am very sorry to learn we have made such a bad start," he wrote. "I sent off The Pupil with a quite serene conviction that I had done a distinctly happy thing." The rejection, James said, made him "nervous and insecure" about the other works he had intended to write on demand for Scudder (10 Nov. 1890, Letters 3: 307). According to Leon Edel, the jolt from his first Atlantic rejection shook James sufficiently to lead him, with great personal distaste, to contract with one of the first of the new literary agents, A. P. Watt, for help in placing his work ( Letters 3: 194). Hearing nothing from James for several months, Scudder now began to feel nervous himself. "Why this deathly silence?" he wrote. James' response suggested both that the rejection had continued to rankle and that he had a very different idea than Scudder of an editor's rights. "Your letter demands a frank answer. My 'deathly silence' has been the result of the fact that . . . I quite failed to see that you had treated me fairly: I could not see that it was a performance that the Atlantic ought to have declined—nor banish from my mind the reflection that the responsibility, in any case, as regards the readers of the magazine, the public, should, when it's a question of an old and honourable reputation, be left with the author himself. The editor, under such circumstances, may fairly leave it to him. . . . These impressions were distinctly chilling as regards the production of further work" (4 March 1891, Letters 3: 338). Scudder lamented to his diary that James "did not take my rejection of his story with as much equanimity as I first thought" (13 March 1891). The conciliatory editor now urged the author to contribute not only three more stories but also a personal remembrance of the recently deceased James Russell Lowell. All of these were duly written and accepted with polite gratitude, including assurance that even the punctuation would be "rigidly respected" (21 Oct. 1891). Convinced of the collapse of the market for his serial fiction, which had sustained him, James tried with humiliating unsuccess during the next several years to win in the theater the appreciative and lucrative audience his fiction lacked. Scudder did not reestablish contact until 1895, when he again solicited from James three short stories, each to run 12,000 to 15,000 words, around twenty pages, a length that was standard for the Atlantic but somewhat longer than most magazines encouraged. James' painful attempts to accommodate this conventional literary form, which he had earlier used with facility, cost him considerable personal agony and considerable irritation with Scudder. They also graphically reflected the growth of both his art and his increased unwillingness in this "major phase" to compromise it. "I will with pleasure," he wrote, "send you three short stories for the Atlantic —if you will permit me to remind you what I mean by 'short.' I can't, with the accumulated manner which is the result of my time of life, or maturity of means, treat a subject that I find interesting enough to be treated at all, in the brief compass of the usual snippit story of the usual magazine. . . . I will do my best in the three things you propose to confine myself to . . . about 20 pages of the Atlantic , but I must ask you for a margin or an alternative if hard-pressed" (12 May 1895). The first two "short" stories he began for Scudder eventually became novels. The day after writing Scudder, James found in his notebooks the seed of a story which he tentatively titled "The House Beautiful," about a refined mother dispossessed of a house filled with museum pieces by a philistine son and his boorish, vindictive bride. Within days the story bloomed luxuriantly in his imagination as a three-act drama, outgrowing the narrow limits of twenty pages. The same happened with his next idea, tentatively titled "The Awkward Age." After failing in what he bewailed to himself as a "tragic . . . waste of effort" to contain them, he set the two pieces aside, certain that no magazine editor would take them and that he would have to "make terms for them in some other way, terms bad, terms sadding, at the best" ( Notebooks 131). "The truth is," he lamented to Scudder, "I can't do the very little thing any more, and the process—the endeavour—is most expensive. . . . However, you shall have your three stories, and have them tiny. They are probably the last ( very small ones), I shall ever do—so cherish them" (3 Sept. 1895, Letters 4: 18). But James faced an economic truth that directly conflicted with his aesthetic impulse, the truth that he still needed income from magazines and that those few magazines that still asked him for anything were asking him for single-number stories, generally of 10,000 words or less. On sitting down to make the next attempt for Scudder he wrote: "I must now try to do the thing of 10,000 words (which there is every economic reason for my recovering and holding the trick of)" ( Notebooks 131). After agonizing for a month attempting with limited success a "ferocious compression" in the third story, "The Glasses," James wrote Scudder: "I am in much humiliation and distress, for though I am sending you something by this post I am not sending you what will satisfy you. This is not, heaven knows, for want of time and labour—but because I can't , alas, even after renewed heroic effort, . . . keep within your limits of space. . . . As I wrote you the other day, I find, in my old age, that I have too much manner and style, too great and invincible an instinct of completeness and of seeing things in all their relations, so that development , however squeezed down, becomes inevitable. . . . I must candidly and cynically say that, rather than worry over [the other promised stories] as I have worried over this, I shall have . . . sadly to renounce the attempt. But I will make it, once more" (4 Oct. 1895, Letters 4: 22). Scudder, genuinely sympathetic to James' tribulations and worried about losing a contributor he valued highly, responded that he liked the story "immensely" and would publish it in a single number despite its length. He also invited James to rework one of the earlier stories into a three- or four-part serial instead of agonizing over two new stories. James expressed his "eternal gratitude" and proposed to work "The House Beautiful" into a short serial of 30,000 to 40,000 words. Inevitably, what was proposed as a story of 12,000 words and recast into a serial of 30,000, swelled to a novel of 70,000 words by the time Scudder ran it in seven installments in 1896 as "The Old Things" and Houghton Mifflin published it under the title The Spoils of Poynton . It was James' longest work since The Tragic Muse in 1890. Scudder joked to his protégée Josephine Peabody that "Henry James can make his hero make a speech of 20,000 words by just looking in some peculiar way at the heroine" (Diary, 10 Dec. 1896). But he accommodated the expansion of Spoils at each step, praised the "delicate patterns" of the narrative, and declared himself "filled with admiration of the art which has so firmly defined conduct so evasive" (to James, 9 June 1896). James defended the expansion as necessitated by aesthetic integrity, and expressed gratitude: "one has to do these things as one can (at least I have), and as one 'can' depends on the whole aesthetic life of one's donné. I am greatly obliged to you for your patience and tolerance" (to Scudder, 21 May 1896). Later, however, recalling the evolution of The Spoils of Poynton in the Preface to the New York edition, James wrote: "I found myself—as against a mere commercial austerity—beguiled and led on," while "the sole impression it made [on the editor], I woefully gathered, was that of length . . ." (x). James' sensitivity had made his memory selective; Scudder had actively invited the short serial and praised it sincerely. But as editorial negotiator between James and the public, he had indeed responded to a "commercial austerity" rooted in the resistance of even the educated reading public, as well as his employers, to James' later style. James, adept at defending his aesthetic integrity from editors since Howells' time, was, of course, right to resist the confinement of "magazineable" short fiction. But at a time when most American and British magazine editors were not asking James for anything, Scudder's solicitations had initiated at least six stories and two short novels; and the Atlantic during his editorship had carried seven of only sixteen pieces of non-dramatic fiction that James published in the years 1890 through 1896. Scudder had also asserted both in a long series of reviews and in Houghton Mifflin's publishing councils that James was a consummate literary artist who had achieved permanent stature and deserved to be more widely read. Unfortunately, his successor would not agree. In 1895, Scudder had hired Walter Hines Page, who had recently resurrected the polemical New York monthly The Forum , as his assistant, and by 1896 Page was given virtual control of the magazine, though he was not officially named editor until 1898. During his four years at the Atlantic the enormously forceful and energetic Page laid the groundwork for its transformation over the next twenty years from a respected but musty literary periodical with a circulation of 11,000 to a thriving monthly commentary emphasizing current affairs with a circulation over 100,000. In the process, he eliminated it as a market for Jamesian fiction. Page represented a new type of "progressive journalism" in its purest form (Wilson 40-62). Page had learned magazine editing in the early nineties in New York, where a host of entrepreneurial editor-publishers like Frank Munsey, Edward Bok, and the archetype, Samuel McClure, were creating a new wave of 15 cent "magazines for the masses" that rapidly gained circulations of several hundred thousands and threatened to drain writers, advertising, and subscribers from the old 35-cent "quality" monthlies like Harper's , Scribner's , and the Century . Page, although recognizing the entirely different tradition and current audience of the Atlantic , attempted a pragmatic application of the new magazine journalism to the old Boston organ. While previous Atlantic editors from Lowell to Scudder had aimed to "represent the permanent element in American literature" and in some sense to produce a monthly book, Page believed that a magazine had a shelf life of thirty days. Its focus should be on contemporary issues, not aesthetics or history. Its style and substance should be essentially journalistic, not literary. It should aim to have as direct, forceful, and immediate an impact on as broad an audience as possible. Page explicitly rejected Aldrich and Scudder's tacit acceptance of the Atlantic as filling a small, "high-culture," literary niche. Like other prominent progressives—Roosevelt, whom he knew and supported, and Wilson, who later appointed him ambassador to England during the First World War—Page regretted the alienation that Santayana and Van Wyck Brooks would later define between intellectual and cultural interests on the one hand and social, economic, and political action on the other. Motivated, therefore, by both financial incentive and progressive personal ideology, Page explicitly edited the Atlantic to reduce the previous gap between high and middlebrow culture, between literature and journalism, and to promote the application of humanistic intellectual training to contemporary social issues. Page's editorial treatment of literature was based on the same combination of progressive values and pragmatic ambition for a larger circulation. Atlantic editors since Lowell had believed that literary criticism in the magazine could establish high standards and discourage commercial cheapening of literature, and many of James' literary essays had been published in the Atlantic in support of this conviction. Page, however, dismissed literary criticism as "mere talkee-talkee." Written by alienated intellectuals who sneered at public tastes, literary criticism was, he believed, actually destructive. "The present dearth in American letters," he wrote, "is due to the abnormal development of our smart critical faculty and our lack of sympathy alike with writers and with people in the mass" (to J. E. Chamberlin, 30 Sept. 1896). Accordingly, Page reduced Atlantic literary criticism by two-thirds, giving the additional space to current affairs; unlike his predecessors, he published none of James' literary essays. Page showed a similar financially pragmatic progressivism in selecting fiction. Indifferent to literary quibbles such as the distinction between realism and romance, Page liked what had immediate "human," emotional impact and disliked the excessively subtle, cerebral, and aesthetically refined. He accepted Jack London's first nationally published story, launched Charles Chesnutt's career as a professional writer, and solicited authors as various as Stephen Crane, Abraham Cahan, James Whitcomb Riley, Mary Johnston, and the frothy Kate Douglas Wiggin. Page shared the contempt of another red-blooded progressive, Theodore Roosevelt, for the neurotic, cynical, self-indulgent, mollycoddling fiction of psychological introspection. Page explained his literary philosophy in a letter to F. Hopkinson Smith, who had submitted a Jamesian psychological study by a young protégée, Lillie French: "[The story] is too subjective, too introspective. We wish to keep the Atlantic utterly free from the present fashion of stories about the innermost vitals and immortal souls of meditative people." To Miss French herself he wrote: "Our feeling is very strong in favor of stories not necessarily of adventure, but certainly of action—objective rather than subjective stories. We believe that wholesomeness in literature as well as in life discourages . . . the laying of emphasis on introspective tendencies. We are aware that in this feeling we run counter to a strong fashion in current fiction, but this strong fashion is itself . . . an additional reason why the Atlantic Monthly should stand for the opposite tendency" (4 March 1897). Obviously, editorial solicitations to James ceased abruptly when Page took control in 1896. When James tested the silence in 1898 by submitting the short novel "In a Cage," Page wrote in his reader's report: A duller story I have never read. It wanders through a deep mire of affected writing and gets nowhere, tells no tale, stirs no emotion but weariness. The professional critics who mistake an indirect and round-about use of words for literary art will call it an excellent piece of work; but people who have blood in their veins will yawn and throw it down—if, indeed, they ever pick it up. (Houghton Mifflin MS Report 6743, quoted in Ballou 455-456) Page had implied in his letter to Lillie French that his editorial stand against the "strong fashion" of psychological introspection in fiction was a bold risk. In fact, however, he was entirely aware that his stand was a financial advantage. The vogue of historical romance, in part a popular reaction against the "morbidities" of naturalism and psychological realism, was in full sway, selling vast numbers of books; and Page, like the Century's Gilder and other editors, welcomed it. Citing several romances on the firm's list, including one he was serializing in the Atlantic , Page enthusiastically bragged to Scudder in 1897 that "the second and third rate literature booms" (3 Sept. 1897). Page's own greatest coup was securing a novel titled To Have and to Hold by a fellow southerner, Mary Johnston. The work was, as Howells would have said, pure Scott-and-water, but Page and the firm's promotion director MacGregor Jenkins knew they had a windfall when they found the stenographers borrowing galley proofs to read at lunch time. To Have and to Hold temporarily "almost doubled" Atlantic circulation when it was serialized in 1899, and it sold 275,000 copies during its first year as a book (Perry, Gladly Teach 175; Ballou 464, 422). Just as To Have and to Hold was creating a boom in Atlantic circulation, the ambitious Page was hired by S. S. McClure to rule "a kingdom or two" at Harper Brothers, which had recently gone into receivership to J. P. Morgan. A desperate Scudder and Mifflin, prompted by promotion director Jenkins, hired Princeton professor Bliss Perry to fill the vacancy in the Atlantic editorship. Perry, himself a writer of realistic fiction as well as author of the first major scholarly work on Whitman, had a more sophisticated, modern literary taste and greater commitment to literature than Page. Perry knew also that James was perhaps the greatest living writer of fiction in English and one whose stature would be permanent. When W. C. Brownell proposed contributing a major overview of James' work, Perry welcomed the offer, commenting that "a square look in the mirror ought to prepare his soul for the Judgment Day. . . . There will be one for him, I know, whatever may be the luck of the rest of us" (3 Feb. 1905). As an academic in publishing, however, Perry was insecure. He needed to prove his commercial mettle and was oversensitive to advice and pressure from other members of the firm. From Mifflin, he felt a mandate to continue Page's progressive emphasis on current events, an emphasis that Mifflin credited with boosting Atlantic circulation from around 11,000 to 18,000 in a few years. Another strong influence on Perry was the magazine's business director, MacGregor Jenkins, a fellow Williams graduate who became a collegial guide for the inexperienced Perry. Jenkins, who remained with the Atlantic long after Perry had shaken its dust from his feet, had decided views on literature which he later condensed into a lecture and book titled Literature with a Large L. Like Page, Jenkins was committed, for both ideological and even more transparently commercial reasons, to reducing the gap between highbrow and popular culture. He expressed genial contempt for "Literature with a Large L," aesthetically self-conscious, intellectually sophisticated, excessively subtle literature written by precious professional aesthetes, further desiccated in the literary criticism of pretentious professorial types, and appropriately viewed with deep suspicion by the majority as terminally "highbrow." The only genuine purposes of literature were entertainment and emotional impact. Real literature was written not by professional "literary persons," self-serious about their bogus "art" (and probably demanding large payments), but by people with a vital experience to tell who could express that experience directly to large numbers of their fellows. Jenkins, for whom James was the archetype of the "highbrow" professional literary person, was a resolute voice of the mass market and the Saturday Evening Post influential in the inner councils of the Atlantic . In the fall of 1899, as Perry began his editorship, James, in need of revenue to purchase Lamb House, hired a new literary agent, James Pinker, and again began writing prolifically, producing several stories and a scenario for a novel which eventually became The Ambassadors (Edel, Treacherous Years 337-338). Pinker distributed the stories among the quality monthlies, and Perry, anxious to include James in the magazine's prospectus for 1900, took one titled "Maude Evelyn." Perry also responded favorably to James' proposal to contribute some "literary papers." But with some embarrassment, the editor stated frankly his belief, based partly on Jenkins' analysis of subscription lists, that the Atlantic had a more diverse, less aesthetically and intellectually sophisticated readership than formerly and that this new readership would require concessions: I am tempted to add a word of suggestion about the new audience which the Atlantic is reaching nowadays. More than half of its circulation—which has been growing of late—is now west of the Mississippi, and there are more subscribers in Wisconsin than in any state except Massachusetts. I confess that I am not certain about the temper of this audience, but I know it differs markedly from the old Atlantic circle of readers. The nuances of "Maude Evelyn"—to take a concrete illustration—will be quite lost upon a great many subscribers who are losing their heads over "To Have and to Hold." That cannot be helped, I suppose, and it ought not and will not prevent our printing an occasional story that is too subtle and delicate for "the general." But I think it would be well for you to bear this condition in mind when you are mulling over subjects and possible modes of treatment of the papers which you may from time to time do for us. Please don't think that we are sufficiently journalized to prefer coarser to finer work . . . but it does seem to me essential to the effectiveness of an Atlantic paper nowadays that it should be constructed upon as simple and strong lines as possible. (31 Oct. 1899, Ballou 465) Despite Perry's qualms and a rate of pay now distinctly lower than the New York illustrated monthlies', Pinker judged the Atlantic the most likely target for James' prospective novel. The proposal left Perry uncomfortably undecided for months. In December, he expressed to James clear interest in the novel and wrote Pinker that "we have been considering the outline (of the proposed serial) carefully and are pleased with it" (to James, 13 Dec.; to Pinker, 20 Dec. 1899). He added, however, that negotiations in progress for other serials precluded unreserved commitment. Who were the authors with whom James was now competing for space in the Atlantic ? One was the Virginian Mary Johnston. Page's assistant, William Parker, had spent much of the fall helping her to edit some of the more flamboyant absurdities out of To Have and to Hold . Miss Johnston, an insecure author who depended on her editors for confidence, admitted that "sometimes I think it is the veriest trash that ever escaped a wastebasket" (to Perry, 18 Dec. 1899). But Perry accurately predicted very large book sales and as sales boomed assured her of his sincere interest in her next novel. Second, Albert Houghton, one of the firm's partners and a friend of the bottom line, had recommended Kate Douglas Wiggin, soon to become author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm , whose first book had gradually accumulated sales over 250,000 and who could readily produce a light commercial confection at a reasonable price (Ballou 432-433). On the advice of Horace Scudder, still editor-in-chief of trade books, Perry was also sounding out the popular novelist Arthur Hardy. Finally, both Scudder and Charles Dudley Warner had managed to persuade a reluctant Sarah Orne Jewett, at the height of her career and near its sudden end, to abandon her quiet regional realism for a dash at commercial popularity on the crest of the tidal wave of historical romance, and Scudder was conferring with her about serializing the result. As the new century began in the early spring of 1900, Perry, despite his own taste and conscience, found it increasingly difficult to encourage James' proposal. To Have and to Hold came out as a book in February and sold 135,000 copies in its first two months; James' last novel with the firm, The Tragic Muse , had sold only 897 copies in its first year and for nearly a decade had carried a loss in the firm's list of "Books that Have Not Paid for Themselves" (Ballou 448). Although Miss Johnston would undoubtedly raise her price for her next work, serial rights for To Have had cost only $3500 as opposed to almost $5000 for the Muse and, at James' rate of $15 a page, probably about $4500 for the new novel. In March, Perry wrote James again stalling a decision pending his hearing from "one or two authors to whom we owe every consideration." But by now his tone was dubious: "Furthermore, we must reckon more or less of course, upon the passing taste of the American public. Just now people are quite daft, as you know, over the American historical romance, and incline to be suspicious of anything else. This makes us hesitate—I wish it did not!—to engage a serial from your hand in spite of the convincing plot that you have already submitted. It may be that it will prove best to do so. Yet our uncertainty is so great that I cannot feel comfortable without laying the matter thus frankly before you" (14 March 1900). The nail in the coffin came two weeks later when the April issue of the Atlantic came out carrying James' story, "Maude Evelyn." MacGregor Jenkins, encouraged by Page's legacy of increased political and social reportage and the robust success of Johnston's swashbuckler, had been trying with some success to convince the American News Company that the Atlantic was no longer a "highbrow" literary magazine but deserved wider distribution, including newsstand sales. The appearance of "Maude Evelyn" nearly destroyed his credibility, and he now came to editor Perry "with actual tears in his eyes" beseeching him not to print another "sinker" by James ( Gladly Teach 178). Turning down proposals by both James and Howells, Perry over the next two years serialized Sarah Orne Jewett's The Tory Lover , Mary Johnston's Audrey , A. S. Hardy's His Daughter First , and Kate Wiggin's Penelope's Irish Adventure . Responding to Jewett's gift copy of The Tory Lover , James noted as gently as he could the "fatal cheapness" of historical romance and begged Jewett to "go back to the dear country of the Pointed Firs, come back to the palpable present-intimate" (5 Oct. 1901, Letters 4: 208). No one was more conscious of this fatal cheapness than Perry. By early 1902 he was declaring his loathing of the genre to Page, who characteristically responded that "of course we are all tired of them," but after all, the next one could be another blockbuster (31 Jan. 1902). In an editorial titled "Catering to the Public," Perry tried to vindicate his aesthetic judgment and absolve his troubled New England conscience by frankly, with a veneer of humor, blaming his readership. "Does anyone suppose," he wrote, "that Mr. Munsey's favorite reading is the Munsey Storiettes? Does the sound of the swashbuckler swashing on his buckler seem less humorous to the editors who encourage it than it does to Mr. Howells who has laid aside his editorial armor and can smile at the weaknesses of his former fellow warriors?" (3). Perry's native Yankee humanism eventually made him, unlike Page, unable to live with this cynicism and drove him out of publishing back to academe with bitter memories of his own compromises. Through Howells, The Ambassadors was finally serialized by the flamboyant Col. George Harvey in the North American Review , which he was operating at a loss for prestige (Exman 190). It was the last of James' novels to be serialized. In the future, sympathetic but reluctant magazine editors took only an occasional story, sometimes at Howells' urging. By 1900, the American "quality" magazines, among which the Atlantic had been the most consistently supportive, were no longer a viable market for James' fiction. Fortunately, James' income from his family, resulting from the death of his sister in 1892 and improved management of family property, as well as royalties on an increasing number of books, relieved him of the necessity of constant magazine publication. He was, thus, increasingly liberated to resist compromises with the marketplace, to return his energies mainly to the novel, and to produce the monuments of the "major phase" without what he considered the onerous requirements of serialization. Those requirements had, in some cases, clearly influenced the work he undertook, the shape of his narratives, and his concept of the audience for which he wrote. During James' first fifteen years as a writer, the Atlantic , partly from its early sympathy with realism, partly through Howells' friendship, had provided a major market for his fiction, exerting some but relatively little pressure on James to compromise his aesthetic experimentation and integrity. Between 1875 and 1885, James, building on his Atlantic base and encouraging competition, made good headway in placing some fiction, generally shorter or lighter, in the mainstream illustrated quality magazines, such as Scribner's, Harper's and The Century , that achieved large circulations and success during the seventies and eighties. After the failure of The Bostonians in The Century in 1885, however, it became clear that the New York illustrated monthlies would not provide a market for major novels by James, though they continued, with diminishing frequency, to take short works. During the eighties, the Atlantic under Aldrich had compensated for its sharp decline in circulation by seeking a niche as a defender of high literary culture. Accordingly, Aldrich continued actively to solicit a large quantity of James' work, including the last two full novels before his "major phase." But as the Atlantic began to grow ambitious for a larger circulation, its commitment to James waned. Influenced by the progressive publishing movement of the nineties that produced a new wave of cheaper, larger-circulation magazines like McClure's , Page and business manager Jenkins placed new emphasis on current affairs reportage rather than fiction, journalism rather than "Literature." The Atlantic's survival, effective promotion, and influence, they believed, required systematically diminishing the perceived gap between high literary culture and middle-class popular culture. The progressives also condemned the fiction of psychological realism as not only aesthetically pretentious and dull, but also unhealthy in its encouragement of introspection. Preferring extroversion, vigorous action, and broader readerships, they promoted the inundation of historical romances around the turn of the century. Under these market influences, Perry, like other magazine editors who recognized James' quality and permanence, were ashamedly reluctant to publish his work, often supplanting it with fiction they acknowledged to be third rate.
