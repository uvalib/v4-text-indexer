      <field name="heading_text">Joseph Johnson, an Eighteenth-Century Bookseller by Gerald P. Tyson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the eighteenth century literary patronage gradually shifted from the rich to an expanded reading public, which by financial leverage determined in large measure the taste of the times. The transition, though, was neither immediate nor direct. Meanwhile booksellers filled both roles, advancing cash sums ( qua patron) for the copyright, and selling books of a type and in a manner that would appeal to a wide variety of readers. In fact, the shift from aristocratic patronage to that by the middle class could not have been effected without the intervention of the bookseller-publisher. But this tradesman has often been denied his share of credit by the assumption that his chief desire was to sell books regardless of their quality. Too frequently we ignore his importance in introducing new authors, perhaps thus helping to establish a new vogue, or in sustaining established writers. Even in cases where an author could afford the cost of printing his own work he had still the problem of distribution. Through his connections, however, the bookseller could handle all details of publication from choice of paper and type to advertising and wholesale distribution. But more importantly he could exercise the personal interest a patron might take in a protégé, offering more than the copyright payment. Of all the booksellers in the second half of the century none surpasses Joseph Johnson for business acumen and literary taste. It is he who published the works of Joseph Priestley, scientist and theologian; Henry Fuseli, mannerist painter and litterateur; John Newton, sea captain and evangelical preacher; Anna Letitia Barbauld, poetess; William Wordsworth; Joel Barlow, adventurer, poet, and pamphleteer; William Beckford, author of Vathek ; Richard Price, mathematician and dissenting minister; Theophilus Lindsey, founder of the first Unitarian chapel in Britain; William Godwin and his wife, Mary Wollstonecraft; S. T. Coleridge; William Cowper; Thomas Malthus; Erasmus Darwin, physician, poet, and naturalist; William Hayley, benefactor of Blake and poetaster; and Maria Edgeworth, the novelist. Of these Wordsworth, Fuseli, Mrs. Barbauld, Cowper, Beckford, Lindsey, Malthus, Darwin, Edgeworth, and Priestley were "discovered" by Johnson. Moreover, he was the exclusive English publisher for all of these writers except Wordsworth. Such loyalty between author and bookseller was unusual in a time when writers customarily "shopped around" for a publisher who offered the best terms. In some sense, then, Johnson's commitment to certain writers insured publication of their works, and constituted economic patronage. His consistent backing also reflected a desire to either establish or nourish a readership for a particular kind of literature, so create or maintain a "taste." The factors common to the majority of his authors were rational dissent, moral didacticism, intellectual inquiry, and sensibility. In addition to his financial encouragement of authors Johnson frequently solicited Blake's "graver" from 1780 to 1804 and nearly published his French Revolution in 1791. Furthermore, Johnson's shop and apartment at No. 72 St. Paul's Churchyard were a center for the exchange of news and ideas during the American and French revolutions, since his circle of writers was, with but few exceptions, sympathetic to various kinds of social and political reform. During the early years of the French Revolution he also published monthly the Analytical Review , which quickly drew fire from government hirelings who attacked its liberal bias. But the Analytical was more than merely provocative: it consistently reviewed foreign literature—especially German drama—acquainting readers with the works of Goethe and Kotzebue. This incomplete list of Johnson's professional accomplishments indicates the kinds and extent of "patronage" a bookseller could provide. For not only did he help authors, but he also encouraged liberal notions in his periodical, familiarizing the public with new ideas and literary trends. Curiously, Joseph Johnson has never been the subject of a biography, nor has his circle of authors ever been examined as Dryden's, Pope's, Samuel Johnson's, or Shelley's has. Regrettably, the only biographical statement we have is his obituary. 1 Today, he is mainly remembered as the publisher of Blake's engravings, a distinction which preserves him from total eclipse. The primary reason which has made it easy to overlook Johnson's significance is the stigma of his profession. Unlike Curll or Tonson, kept from oblivion by Pope, or unlike Dodsley, immortalizing himself by writing, Johnson left no legacy except his publications. Attending strictly to the business of bookselling, he fell into a growing and despised brotherhood of literary middlemen. In the popular view they were brokers whose backing helped make the difference between obscurity and fame, but whose interest in literature could only be measured in guineas. 2 Much in his conduct as a bookseller invites us to include Johnson among the exploiters of literary art, living off the labors of others. His earnings on the poetry of Cowper alone were reported to be £10,000. 3 Likewise, his payment of £900 to Darwin for the Botanic Garden indicates he earned a handsome profit here too. 4 In addition to his knack for recognizing authors who would sell, Johnson also depended upon what by modern standards were sound, even shrewd, business practices by diversifying his stock. Although dealing heavily in theological and political tracts, he also published works ranging from medical texts to foreign language grammars. On the average the shop issued one new book or tract a week. From 1770 to 1780 Johnson published approximately 32 works a year, and by the end of the 1780's his annual output reached 75 separate titles for 1788 and 79 for the following year. Such productivity for these years is nearly fifty per cent greater than that of his nearest competitor. 5 All this was performed, so far as I can tell, without any assistance or editorial help save that of a trusted servant who ran errands and arranged for weekly dinner gatherings of authors. No wonder one of Johnson's acquaintances was moved to write of him: "A worthy and most honest man, but incorrigibly neglectful, often to his own detriment." 6 But whether he appeared to fuss with his fledglings or not, his strong business sense was demonstrated even in the slightest details of book production. The obituary tells us that he was opposed to "typographical luxury." 7 In plain terms this meant his books were completely without ostentation. Engravings were limited to works in which he took a special interest. Type faces were plain, quite common in appearance, and usually a bit smaller than most others in current use. The paper was generally the cheapest available. 8 All these factors kept the price of a Johnson issue low, so as to make it possible for a large number of readers to purchase a very utilitarian product. 9 It goes without saying that he disapproved of books that had a limited circulation because of their prohibitive cost. On this ground he seldom published by subscription except when a special demand arose as in the case of Cowper's translation of Homer. 10 Clearly Johnson wanted to put as many books in the hands of the public as he could, and if in the process he realized a large profit, so much the better. Besides low prices, Johnson participated in Congers or syndicates of booksellers to facilitate speedy and wide distribution of his products. The implication of the term Conger is explained by John Dunton in his Voyage Round the World published in 1691: "What kind of fish is a Conger?—Why 'tis an over-grown Eel , that devours all the Food from the weaker Grigs, and when he wants other Food, swallows them too into the bargain. A poor Fly can't stir upon the water, but—pop, he's at him." 11 The facts behind Dunton's description of a Conger are these: it was a monopolistic syndicate of tradesmen who sought to prevent underselling by rivals and to limit the individual risk they took in publishing a work of questionable commercial value. This trade practice arose at the end of the seventeenth century and continued to the beginning of the nineteenth. The members kept very few records of their transactions, preferring to do business verbally at monthly dinner meetings. In fact, Congers were often, at least in Johnson's day, named after the tavern or coffee house in which they met. Johnson belonged to one called the "Chapter Coffee House Conger." Fellow members included Dilly, Elmsley, Davies, Evans, Payne, Longman, Baldwin, Rivington, Murray, Becket, and a few others. 12 Since these organizations tended to be informal and rather ad hoc , it was common to belong to several. Besides the Chapter Coffee House Conger we find Johnson participating along with Davies, Cadell, and Strahan in the publication of Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets in 1779. 13 He also belonged to a group known as the "Friends of Literature" which published a series of books under the rubric of 'Walker's Classics.' In this case we have records showing that of the 2,000 copies for each volume, 1,000 were set aside and divided equally among the five members of the Conger: Johnson, Wilkie, the Rivingtons, Longman, and Cadell. This particular Conger met for dinner at the Queen's Arms Tavern on the third Tuesday of each month until it dissolved in April, 1811. 14 Toward the end of his career, especially after 1800, we find scattered records of sales by Johnson to younger booksellers of his interest in certain publications. In October, 1804, for example, he sold Vernor and Hood 4/32 of his share in a Portuguese dictionary originally published by Nourse in 1773. He made £62 on the exchange. The same year, 1804, he got £23 for a 1/40 share of Dr. Motherby's New Medical Dictionary . 15 In view of his impressive business connections and publishing activity, he was undoubtedly, as his obituary put it, "a Father of the Trade." It is in this role of patriarch that we catch the last glimpse of him in his professional capacity. The occasion was consideration by Parliament in 1808 of a bill affecting the welfare of the booksellers, who, in turn, called a general meeting of all the London brotherhood to draw up a counter proposal. Chairing the meeting, according to the records, was wasted, asthmatic, yet vital, Joseph Johnson. 16 Consistent with his relationship to the trade was his general treatment of authors. When he could Johnson bought cheaply. In the case of Sir John Carr's journal of his trip to France in 1802, which he converted into a popular narrative titled The Stranger in France , Johnson paid £100 for the copyright. This amount just met Carr's travel expenses, but as a beginning author he was in no position to bargain for more. Joseph Farington, who knew the bookseller through Fuseli, reports of the transaction: "It has answered very well to Johnson who has made several hundred pounds by it." 17 On the other hand, for authors in whom he took a special interest, Johnson paid an equitable price. Mary Wollstonecraft's first tract of 160 pages brought her ten guineas, well above the going rate. In the case of Mary and many other of his authors, we can observe Johnson in the role of patron most clearly. He carried his sense of obligation far beyond the purely monetary or ethical. His kindnesses extended from underwriting the publication of works he himself deemed valuable (such as Cowper's Poems and Priestley's theological and scientific tracts), to charitably purchasing manuscripts he had no intention of putting into print. 18 Beyond this humane conduct he practiced a more basic form of charity, making his home, table, and purse accessible to persons in need. We can see innumerable instances of this generosity. When Henry Fuseli, exiled from Zurich, turned up in London virtually friendless, Johnson invited the foreigner to stay in his apartment above the bookshop. Since Fuseli was fluent in German, French, and the classical languages, translating jobs were obtained for him, so he could pursue his new found interest in art. 19 Likewise, No. 72 St. Paul's Churchyard was Priestley's London headquarters during his business trips in the winter. Again, when Joel Barlow arrived in the city from Paris in July 1791, Johnson offered him the chance to write on the subject of the French Revolution in order to earn enough to keep afloat. 20 In fact, Barlow belongs to a second generation of Americans who used the bookshop as a rendezvous, mail drop, and center of hospitality for fellow nationals and sympathizers. Around the corner from the bookshop on Ludgate Hill, Ben Franklin, Joseph Priestley, Richard Price, and undoubtedly Johnson had met during the late sixties and early seventies at The London Coffee House to discuss affairs in the Colonies. And during Barlow's stay in London friends of the French Revolution met at Johnson's for weekly suppers to voice their hopes for the new order. Johnson not only gave support and hospitality to men with unpopular political philosophies, but he also befriended three significant minorities: Scots, Dissenters (mainly Unitarians) and women writers, especially those who might be considered radicals or free-thinkers. Clever Scots nearly always found a welcome in Johnson's bookshop. Alexander Geddes, born in Banffshire, raised a Roman Catholic, ordained a priest in Paris, and translator of the Bible for Catholics, met Johnson soon after coming to London early in 1780 and their relationship continued for twenty years. 21 Another enterprising and talented Scot, Thomas Christie, found employment with the bookseller as editor of the Analytical Review , of which more later. Other Scottish friends of Johnson included James Fordyce and his nephew George, minister and physician respectively, Thomas Cadell, publisher, and Thomas Erskine, the lawyer who challenged nearly every attempt by the government during the French Revolution to curb individual liberties. For the Unitarians Johnson's importance is central. Not only did he publish works by Priestley, Lindsey, Disney, 22 and other Dissenting divines who laid the theological groundwork for Unitarianism, but he also negotiated the rental of an unused auction hall in Essex Street for the first Unitarian Chapel, appearing in person before the Westminster justices and petitioning them for a license to permit Dissenting worship. His last act of support for the Unitarians occurred the year before his death when he turned over to them the copyright which he held for Archbishop William Newcome's translation of the Bible so a new version could be made from it for their worship. 23 With his fairness toward women writers Johnson stands prominently as an exception to the rule of predatory booksellers. The most remarkable instance of his generosity toward the sex relates to Maria Edgeworth. Consistently her publisher from 1795 to 1809, Johnson, in the final days of his life, directed his nephew to pen the following note to her: "My uncle is so afflicted with the spasms and asthma, that he has desired me to write to you to say that he should ill deserve your confidence if he were rigidly to adhere to the contract, which he made for the last work [ Tales of Fashionable Life ]; the sale of which has enabled him to double the original purchase money, and to place the sum to the credit of your account." 24 Shortly after, she received a credit memo for £1,000. 25 But the most enduring example of Johnson's generosity to a woman writer was his beneficence to Mary Wollstonecraft. And here I should like to dwell a bit on their personal and professional relationship to show what this bookseller did when he chose to encourage and support an author. Mary's work was first brought to his attention by the Rev. John Hewlitt, who had used him as a publisher. In the mid-1780's Mary wrote a pamphlet titled Thoughts on the Education of Daughters which Hewlitt sold to Johnson, as mentioned previously, for ten guineas. Before Mary left on a trip to Ireland in the spring of 1786, Hewlitt took her to meet Johnson at his shop. The impressions on both sides must have been especially positive, for on the basis of this interview Mary was encouraged to begin a career in literature. 26 Her next work, unpublished until her death, was Maria , a novel begun after hearing Johnson's kind words of advice. Returning from Ireland in August of 1787, Mary came to London to make her way. Needing food and shelter, and above all seeking employment, she looked up Johnson who responded by inviting her to stay a few weeks at his shop while she settled her affairs and set up quarters in the town. Johnson assumed the responsibility of finding a lodging and in late September obtained a house in George Street, near the south end of London Bridge. He also provided her an income by enlisting her to write Original Stories from Real Life as well as urging her to brush up on French, and to learn Italian and German in order to make translations for him. In May of 1788 her connection with the bookseller grew further as Johnson launched the Analytical Review , for which Mary was not only a reader, or editor, but also one of the major reviewers. Laboring in this somewhat Grubbean vineyard she worked with Thomas Christie, who had come to Johnson several months earlier with the proposal for a periodical on the plan of the recently defunct Maty's New Review . 27 Besides her duties for the Analytical , Mary also translated Jacques Necker's Importance of Religious Opinions , and compressed Salzman's German original of Elements of Morality with eight engravings by Blake. Reviewing these years after her death, Godwin remarked dourly that her efforts "answered the mere mercantile purpose of the day." 28 Yet Mary's growth as a writer and social critic continued even when she wasn't engaged in some project for Johnson. For at his shop she met and came to know Joseph Priestley, Henry Fuseli, William Blake, Mrs. Barbauld, John Aikin, Thomas Paine, John Horne Tooke, Thomas Holcroft, Mary Hays, Joel Barlow, Thomas Christie, and William Godwin. Furthermore, her reviews for the Analytical put her in touch with the ideas of men she could not otherwise meet or perhaps would not have read. It was at Johnson's, too, that she conceived the now legendary passion for Fuseli. Indeed, from contemporary accounts and extant letters one gets the impression that between 1787 and 1792 her social and professional lives were one: they both centered on No. 72 St. Paul's Churchyard. In view of the tone of some of her letters it appears that she developed an emotional dependence on her benefactor. It is certainly easy to understand her sense of gratitude toward him. For example, in an undated note she writes to Johnson: "You are my only friend—the only person I am intimate with.—I never had a father, or a brother —you have been both to me ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes. Yours sincerely, Mary." 29 The gratuitous confession at the end of this letter came easily for one like Mary Wollstonecraft. Her passionate, mercurial nature, answered repeatedly by Johnson's calm, phlegmatic temper, often led her to self-reproach. No matter how dire her situation seemed, he urged a deliberate response. Once, in composing a reply to Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France she reached a psychological impasse under the weight of the press deadline, since the finished portion of her manuscript had already been struck off. Appearing at Johnson's shop in a state of agitation, her mind was immediately put at ease by his offering to throw out the finished copy and relieve her of the responsibility of completing her task. 30 Whether or not his response was calculated to urge her on we do not know, but the fact is that she returned to complete the Vindication of the Rights of Man and soon after to correct it for a second edition, all in the space of four weeks. 31 The association of Mary Wollstonecraft and Johnson came at a propitious time, for shortly after their acquaintance began in 1786 he started the Analytical Review to which she gave invaluable assistance. Johnson was the "Proprietor" of this journal, that is, the equivalent of a managing editor, handling the practical details of production and distribution. No other single venture of Johnson's occupied so much of his attention for so long a span of his career. Although its significance derives primarily from the various reviewers who helped it along, final responsibility for their selection lay with him, as did the economic burden. Ultimately it was the Analytical which contributed to Johnson's imprisonment in the final year of its publication. 32 One of the bookseller's few extant letters shows him busily soliciting material for his new review. It is to a correspondent in Scotland, dated June 5, 1788: Sir I request you will do me the favor to accept the first number of a new Literary Journal, and if any communications offer that come within the nature of our plan shall be obliged to you for them. If you think it proper to send a prospectus (short) of any new work in which you are engaged, we shall endeavor to give it a place. I am sir, Your most obedient servant J. Johnson June 5, 1788 33 Unquestionably he put up the initial investment and kept the magazine going when things reached a low ebb. Its circulation was, for the eighteenth century, sizeable, being 1500 copies per month. 34 Johnson himself often arranged for the review of a particular book and sent manuscripts to his printer. He then supervised distribution of the finished copies to other booksellers, for which his trade connections were indispensable. Although Christie served as editor-in-chief, on one occasion we find Johnson wrestling with the problem of selecting the major theological reviewer. 35 But his other publishing duties prevented his taking a greater hand in the affairs of the Analytical , so that when replacements could not be found in 1797 for Christie and Wollstonecraft the periodical's quality fell off. For the first nine years of its existence, however, the review stood in the forefront of libertarianism. It espoused political and social ideologies sympathetic to the French Revolution, opposed the slave trade, encouraged parliamentary reform, supported religious toleration for Catholics and Unitarians, and acquainted readers with Continental literature, especially from Germany, which, until the end of the eighteenth century, was relatively unknown in England. The format of the magazine was entirely of reviews: perhaps eight or ten lengthy ones of important works, followed by as many as twenty shorter notices. Each issue also gave intelligence of foreign academies and political assemblies. Its importance for the history of periodicals is summed up by Walter Graham in his English Literary Periodicals : "It has been noted that the Analytical reflected the romantic or sentimental drift of literature during the 1790's better than any other periodical." For this reason he concludes, "The Analytical Review , because of its forward looking tendency in politics and literature, is unquestionably one of the most important periodical sources for the student of the late eighteenth century." 36 The Analytical had two kinds of competition: friendly and antagonistic. Griffiths' Monthly Review and Richard Phillips' Monthly Magazine qualified for the former category since in general outlook they both agreed with Johnson's sheet. In fact, they shared a small pool of reviewers who worked for all three magazines at one time or another. On the other hand the Anti-Jacobin Review suggests by its very title an entrenched and aggressive sort of opposition. This monthly grew out of a short-lived newspaper called the Anti-Jacobin, or, Weekly Examiner which lasted just over seven months, kept alive by government financing. 37 Its more rabid successor, published by J. Whittle, addressed the reader at the end of the first year (December 1798) with this retrospective look at its chief accomplishment: "The Analytical Review has received its death-blow, and we have more reason to congratulate ourselves upon the share which we have had in producing its dissolution, than it would be expedient here to unfold." 38 Similarly, the prospectus appearing with the first number of July 1798 focused on a national enemy that needed to be exposed and rejected by Britons: the Jacobin—active, it seems, since the year of the establishment of the Analytical , and, coincidentally, the year of the first rumblings in France. Both events were seen as parts of an international scheme to bring revolution and anarchy at home and across the Channel. While the Anti-Jacobin Review could do little about affairs abroad, it could oppose men, who, in its words, "favoring the views of the French Economists and other Philosophists of modern times, have facilitated the propagation of principles, subversive of social order, and, consequently, destructive of social happiness." 39 The lead review set the tone that was to be followed throughout the volume and succeeding ones, using the opportunity to gloat over Joseph Priestley's recent exile to America and his obscurity there. 40 Another regular department for the Anti-Jacobin's vitriol and innuendo was the section called "The Reviewers Reviewed." The purpose of this was to take liberal rivals to task, to "review the Monthly , criticize the Critical , and analyze the Analytical Reviews ." 41 In the early numbers Johnson comes under heavy attack both because he was proprietor of the latter and because of his willingness to publish works "destructive of social happiness" by men such as Godwin, Priestley, Darwin, Horne Tooke, Barlow, and Gilbert Wakefield, an enfant terrible of revolutionary politics. In a characteristic review of two books attacking Wakefield's seditious tract, Reply to the Bishop of Llandaff , the Anti-Jacobin castigates Johnson and his reviewers for writing kind words about a fellow bookseller whom the government arrested for selling the infamous tract. The Anti-Jacobin reviewer writes: But does the Analytical reviewer expect to impose on the public by this affectation of liberality to a man to whose fate he is perfectly indifferent? Does he imagine that we do not know that the proprietor of the Analytical Review is himself under prosecution for selling the same pamphlet of Mr. Wakefield's? It is not the prosecution of Mr. Cuthell, then, but the prosecution of Mr. Johnson, that excites the indignation of these venal and contemptible critics, as well as that of the whole party, who are bursting with spite, and thirsting for revenge. It is by his orders to men whom he pays for scribbling in his miserable Review, that every writer who exposes the defects , as they are delicately termed, of Mr. Wakefield's pamphlet, is abused in the most scurrilous and indiscriminate manner. We advise, therefore, these critics, in future, to throw off a mask which will no longer conceal their object, and boldly, if they dare , pronounce an eulogy, on the loyalty of this favorite publisher [Johnson] and friend of the Priestleys, the Darwins, the Godwins, and other unprejudiced authors, who have kindly taken upon themselves, for the last twenty years, the important task of enlightening the public mind. 42 Partly through the efforts of this government inspired and financed periodical, Johnson's Analytical Review shut down in 1798 only to be revived briefly by a new proprietor and staff. 43 But they could not breathe life into it for several reasons and the last issue appeared in June of 1799. Complicating matters, Johnson had been found guilty ostensibly for selling Wakefield's seditious pamphlet and was fined £50 and sentenced to nine months in the King's Bench Prison in 1798. Owing to his wealth, however, his imprisonment was hardly an inconvenience. He rented the Marshal's House and continued to give his weekly dinner parties. Here he was visited by Maria Edgeworth and her father, Crabb Robinson, Fuseli, and all the other regular attendants of Tuesdays and Sundays. Business, too, carried on as usual from the prison. Coleridge's Fears in Solitude was issued in December as were a new edition of Cowper's Poems , Edgeworth's Practical Education , and an Introduction to the German Language . Upon his release, Johnson traveled to his home town of Liverpool for a vacation with Fuseli and a Mr. Sturch, secretary of the radical Society for Constitutional Information. 44 The rest of the bookseller's career is a good deal less flamboyant than the first forty years. Secure in his profession and recognized as one of its leaders, Johnson obtained for himself the sine qua non of an established tradesman: a house in the suburbs. He rented Acacia Cottage in Fulham where he spent weekends entertaining his intimate friends. 45 Fuseli and Joseph Farington of the Royal Academy came often for dinner and a game of whist. Fuseli usually brought his sketch book, identifying his completed drawings with his signature and the initials "P.C." for "Purser's Cross," the location of his host's cottage. 46 At some point around the turn of the century Johnson brought his two nephews into the business to insure its outliving him. But Rowland Hunter and John Miles could not maintain the company after Johnson's death in 1809 and soon began divesting themselves of his copyrights. Hunter eventually disposed of the shop itself in 1836. 47 Perhaps now we can pause to give a tentative evaluation of Johnson's importance not only in terms of the history of the eighteenth-century book trade, but also as his policies affected the development of literature toward the turn of the century. As far as bookselling itself is concerned, this period saw the publication of books change from a process controlled by a relatively small group of men for whom and to whom books were written, to one in which authors could address tens of thousands of readers having disparate backgrounds and tastes. Among the ranks of the trade, Johnson emerges certainly as a dominant figure. With regard to the bookseller's effect on literature, we can say it too was considerable, for initially the new patrons kept the power and authority of their counterparts, deciding whom and what should be broadcast to the town and the country. (In Johnson's case we may even say the world, for through his authors he had informal connections with booksellers in France, Germany, and America.) 48 To disseminate their thoughts, new writers were virtually dependent on the taste or judgment of the bookseller. It is incorrect to think of a man like Cadell, or Longman, as acting disinterestedly in the affairs of an author. They wanted, even then, a best-seller, a money-maker. Occasionally, of course, they would suspend this pecuniary instinct to bring out a work by a friend, or to add yet another factious voice to the babel of controversy. Naturally, established authors never lacked a bookseller for long, but the untried needed an ally, a sympathetic advocate to get into print. Even if one could afford to publish at his own cost, distribution was a problem. The fossils of eighteenth-century literature can be recognized by this epitaph on the title page: "Printed for the Author and Sold at ———," usually the author's home or his printer's warehouse. An active Conger or bookseller with connections, though, could spread copies throughout the town, as well as the countryside. All this suggests a new way of approaching the question of literary popularity and taste during the course of the century. To take an early instance, consider the initiative of the trade with Dr. Johnson. At first he despaired of anyone compiling a dictionary of the English language. Then encouraged by a syndicate he undertook the task. 49 Nor would we have his Lives of the Poets if it had not been for the urging of Davies, Strahan, and Cadell. But besides this kind of direct initiation, booksellers influenced not only the kind of work written, but also controlled, in many cases, its very content. The old notion of the crass tradesman is overturned by a number of instances where Joseph Johnson showed surprising knowledge of a variety of subjects. For example, he edited all of Cowper's Table Talk with discreet editorial marks beside lines he had doubts about. 50 Cowper revised the poem using these queries as a guide, later writing to his publisher offering "many thanks for your judicious remarks." 51 Or again, he practiced a very high-handed sort of editing in the case of Captain John Stedman's account of his adventures in Surinam. He complained of Johnson's meddling, "the first volume of my book [is] quite marr'd, oaths and sermons inserted, &amp;c." 52 Finally, what of the still-born works that were bought in MS but never published because they "failed to answer"? This is not to relieve an author of his role in creating or fulfilling a taste for particular literary vogues. I am certainly not suggesting that the appeal, say, of Henry Mackenzie's Man of Feeling was due to his bookseller. Clearly, Constable, his Edinburgh publisher, saw the potential of an audience for this sentimental work which captured the essence of a long established trend. But the merit of a Cowper, exploring new poetic trends, or a Darwin, bringing a generous dose of natural history to verse, or a Priestley, ranging the outskirts of science and religion, must have been for a publisher much more problematic. 53 Taste, sensitivity both to the currently popular and to possible new directions, was needed. That Joseph Johnson had this quality in good measure seems evident. How his achievement has gone unrecognized for so long is the mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The obituary on Johnson, written by John Aikin, appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for Dec. 1809, pp. 1167-1168. Within the past year the first modern biographical sketch of the bookseller was published in The Wordsworth Circle by Paul M. Zall under the rather misleading title of "The Cool World of Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Joseph Johnson, or the Perils of Publishing," TWC , 3, No. 1 (Winter, 1972), pp. 25-30. Aside from biographical details, our articles share only a sense of discovery. 2 This distrust of the booktrade, especially publishers, goes back at least to the Renaissance. Michael Drayton in a letter to Drummond of Hawthornden of 14 April, 1619, growls: "The booksellers and I are in Terms: They are a Company of base Knaves whom I both scorn and kick at." Quoted in The Letters of Tobias Smollett , ed. Lewis M. Knapp (1970), p. 12, n. 2. 3 Henry Curwen, A History of Booksellers (1873), p. 68. Although this assertion has never been documented, it is consistent with the number of editions of Cowper's poems Johnson published and his generosity to the poet. See Norma Russell, A Bibliography of William Cowper to 1837 (1963). 4 For the second part of the Botanic Garden Darwin received 1,000 guineas in advance from Johnson. Hesketh Pearson, Doctor Darwin (1964), p. 210. 5 These figures come from the Universal Catalogue (London, 1772-1774), Henry Maty's New Review (London, 1783), the Analytical Review (London, 1788-1790). Cadell, the second most prolific publisher in 1788, published only 53 works as opposed to Johnson's 75. Obviously a more thorough check needs to be made, but the sheer arbitrariness of the years I selected to examine is some slight protection against statistical aberration. However, I make no claim for the absolute accuracy of my figures; they are given to indicate the scope of Johnson's activity. 6 Herbert McLachlan, Letters of Theophilus Lindsey (1920), p. 7. 7 Aikin, p. 1168. 8 See Norma Russell, passim and Augustus J. C. Hare, The Life and Letters of Maria Edgeworth , I, 174, n. 1. Both Popular Tales (1804) and Tales of Fashionable Life (1809) were printed, according to Miss Edgeworth, on very poor paper, typical of Johnson's economical methods. 9 A typical price for one of Johnson's pamphlets was 1/—. That for a book-length work with few or no illustrations was in the neighborhood of 4/— to 12/—. 10 The one significant argument between Johnson and Cowper centered upon the bookseller's reluctance to issue the translation by subscription. 11 John Dunton, A Voyage Round the World (1691), II, 77.

Paul Zall in his brief sketch of Johnson states that the bookseller's practice "was to set manuscripts into type as each page was completed" (p. 27). In fact, this was used by Johnson only when pressing to publish a work by a particular deadline. The urgency in this case was his desire to capitalize on the controversy of Burke's Reflections . Mary's Vindication of the Rights of Man was the first riposte to appear. 31 Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman was begun soon after this episode. It was her phrase "Rights of Man" which Paine adopted for the title of his rejoinder to Burke. 32 Among the affidavits filed in connection with Johnson's trial for selling Wakefield's seditious pamphlet is an "Affidavit in Aggravation of Joseph Johnson," sworn by one George Holditch, which includes without comment a copy of the AR (IX) for Sept. 1798.

The figure originally came from Timperley's Encyclopedia of Literary and Typographical Anecdote (1842). 35 Priestley recommended the Rev. J. Bretland of Dawlish, but Johnson, for some reason, gave the job to Alexander Geddes. This occurred nearly two years before Johnson published any of Geddes' books or pamphlets.

Presumably the agreement was reciprocal. Also Thomas Christie in an undated note to Johnson in the Edinburgh University Library (la. II. 647/85) mentions a supply of books to be sent to a Mr. Cronstadt in Germany. The sale was a large one for it included all of Priestley's works along with other titles. 49 On this point see Boswell's Life and James H. Sledd and Gwin J. Kolb Dr. Johnson's Dictionary: Essays in the Biography of a Book (1955). 50 Cowper closes one of his first letters to Johnson, "All your other marks have been attended to, and I thank you for them."

Such a view denies intellectual initiative and implies a harshly narrow standard for judging his place in literature. Besides, as we have seen in his selection of a theological reviewer for the AR , Johnson ignored the advice of Priestley and acted on his own.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Minute Books of the St. James's Chronicle by Richmond P. Bond and Marjorie N. Bond *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In March 1761 the St. James's Chronicle started its long, very long life, appearing on the 14th of the month as a triweekly evening paper and continuing far into the next century after merging with several other newspapers along the way. 1 Shortly before it made its appearance in London an enterprising printer, Henry Baldwin, had purchased three papers from William Rayner, another printer—the London Spy, Read's Weekly Journal , and St. James's Evening Post, or British Gazette . The Spy and the Journal were joined together into a single Saturday paper, and the St. James's Evening Post gave way to the St. James's Chronicle: or, the British Evening-Post . To secure financial support for the undertaking Baldwin created a joint-stock company, one of the first such organizations formed to publish a newspaper; the Minutes covering the meetings of the Partners in the company for fifty-four years are recorded in the manuscript Minute Books which are the subject of the present study. Before Baldwin began publishing the Chronicle English journalism had slowly expanded from the crude pamphlets of the preceding century into sizeable newspapers which were ably directed, capably printed, well patronized by advertisers, and strong enough to influence the affairs of state. Consequently the new paper encountered several well-established rivals which were already competing for popular acceptance, among them the Public Advertiser and the Gazetteer , two morning papers with daily frequency, and the London Evening Post and the London Chronicle , two triweekly evening papers. In a vigorous contest for readers and for sales the Chronicle , on the evidence of the Minute Books, had its own not inconsiderable success. In format the paper was similar in many respects to a number of other evening journals of its generation—four folio pages measuring approximately 18 by 12 inches, each page containing four columns. The type was far too small for modern tolerance, and many of the advertisements were almost illegible. The paper appeared on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays and was printed by Baldwin at the Britannia Printing Office, White Friars, Fleet Street. The first issue was gratis, and the price of the next issue was twopence, soon to be advanced by a halfpenny. In general the average issue was clearly organized and compact, with a neatness of composition and imposition somewhat better than that seen in many of its competitors. In content the Chronicle resembled most of its contemporaries—news domestic, foreign, metropolitan; news political, economic, maritime, military, Parliamentary, literary, theatrical; poems, essays, letters, and essay-letters; miscellanea; and the inevitable specula of the day, the advertisements of books, goods, opportunities, occasions, and people. At the outset the Proprietors of the joint-stock company owning the Chronicle were Baldwin himself and one other printer, one author, and seven booksellers; they were joined almost immediately by two other Partners, a doctor and another author. This predominance of booksellers was natural and no doubt mutually beneficial. The experience, resources, and connections of men in the trade would be helpful to the Chronicle in establishing and developing itself as a London newspaper, and for the men themselves, aside from any possible prestige and influence, there would be monetary advantages. As members of the joint-stock company they had a chance to make a profit on the Chronicle , and they were also able to advertise their merchandise in the paper on a very favorable arrangement. The first such benefit was uncertain during the early years; the second was made quite certain at the very beginning when the Proprietors resolved that the Printer would be "at Liberty to insert Partners Advertisements, not exceeding two per Week of each Partner's, charging such Partners Advertisements with the Duty only." 2 Henry Baldwin, the man who started it all, was a printer of "the Old School; bred under . . . the original Printer of 'The London Magazine'"; he had been a liveryman of the Stationers' Company only a few years when he established the Chronicle . 3 In legal matters he was the responsible publisher, and it was apparently his organizing power that gathered together the original group of Partners and that for many years produced an attractive, influential newspaper. The ubiquitous John Nichols thought well of Baldwin's work and his personality, and the Minutes reflect his diplomacy and initiative as the founding father who respected his colleagues and carefully sought the proper unity of industry and honesty. Over the years he alienated one share to his brother Richard and purchased one of the two shares held in trust by Bonnell Thornton. When Henry Baldwin retired, after forty-seven years as the principal figure, he relinquished his two shares to his son Charles. Baldwin died in 1813 after a lengthy career of fruitful and honorable journalism which has brought him less fame than is his due. The man who through his intelligence and application helped almost as much as Baldwin to make the St. James's Chronicle into a large successful enterprise was a young Oxonian named Nathaniel Thomas. He came to the Britannia Printing Office a few months after the paper started and gave his skill as Editor to the smooth matching of printed words with occasions. The Partners offered him a guinea a week "for translating the Mails, and making Extracts and giving Accounts of such Books and Pamphlets as may be recommended, or he may think worthy Notice, and doing other Matters for the Service of the Paper." His stipend was increased "in Consideration of the Care he has taken," and in 1765 his yearly salary was set at 120 guineas. Finally after sixteen more years Thomas was admitted to the body of Proprietors and entered "his first Signature" to the Minutes in a moment, we should hope, of justified sentiment. When this "gentleman of great learning, sound judgment, and singular modesty" died in 1795 he was quickly succeeded by one Tomlins, who received the same pay of ten guineas a month. 4 It would appear from the Minutes and the newspaper itself that the long work of Nathaniel Thomas was at least a minor mark of editorial distinction in the history of English journalism. Three of the Proprietors were figures of literary note, all of whom by connection or contribution gave the paper an interesting tone as well as content. They were Bonnell Thornton, George Colman, and David Garrick. Thornton had had a larger experience with the periodic press than any other original Partner, for he had already conducted two minor periodicals, the Have at You All and Spring-Garden Journal , and he was also the co-founder and collaborator with Colman of the lively, prominent Connoisseur . Thornton's wit and versatility must have been particularly useful to the Chronicle in its first years. Of all the Proprietors, Colman had the closest relation to the paper since he was long a Partner and also a frequent contributor. His series of essays called "The Genius" appeared early, when the paper needed a quick wit and deft style; these essays dealt with topics like country life, humor, slander, and the "Reading Desk of the Genius in the British Museum," in which a modern reader may find special enjoyment. 5 By the time Colman died in 1794, after thirty-three years as a Proprietor, he was a famous dramatist, essayist, theatre manager, translator, editor, and the father of another wit. David Garrick, a friend of Colman, had long been a celebrated actor and a man of spirited temperament. There is no entry in the Minutes to date his admission to the company; however, there are frequent references to the Chronicle in his letters, including some that are derogatory. It has been stated that Garrick, Thornton, and Colman had a controlling interest in the paper and even founded it as their professional organ, but the Minutes give no indication of any attempt to control the paper by one Partner or any clique. 6 It was Baldwin as the Printer who naturally served as the prime mover, present at the center of important deliberations and decisions and a fair but firm administrative officer for some forty years. Among the early Proprietors four of the seven booksellers were active in the affairs of the paper, particularly in such chores as examining the accounts, writing the Minutes, and the like. Lockyer Davis was well acquainted with books and business; 7 Christopher Henderson and Thomas Lowndes were often helpful in managerial ways. Thomas Davies, who had been a popular actor before he became a bookseller, had his finest moment in 1763 when he introduced James Boswell to Samuel Johnson. In 1778 he was a bankrupt and so left the Partners, but he continued his services to the Chronicle in return for substantial payments. 8 Other early members of the company apparently gave small aid to the career of the paper: Thomas Becket, another bankrupt; Ralph Griffiths, who had founded the Monthly Review ; William Jackson, editor of the Oxford Journal ; Robert Davis, a minor bookseller; and Dr. John Berkenhout, formerly a soldier who became a physician and a prolific author in the arts and sciences. Berkenhout applied for a second share, and his Partners consented if he would meet certain conditions, one of which was "treating the Partners with a Haunch." 9 The early Proprietors were replaced from time to time as death or business failure created openings in the membership. Of the new Partners joining the company over the years only one was a man of great promise before becoming a Proprietor—George Steevens, whose edition of Shakespeare had true annotational skill. Some of his satirical poems appeared in the Chronicle . The other Partners in this second group were Richard and Robert Baldwin, brothers of Henry, perhaps included for fraternal reasons as much as professional; William Waller, whose shares had been held in trust; the Reverend Stephen Weston and the Reverend Christopher L. Moody; Alderman and then Lord Mayor Thomas Skinner; Thomas Dyke, the Lord Mayor's partner; Dr. John Gillies; and W. Young, an auctioneer. The twenty-fifth and last Partner was Charles Baldwin, son of the founder. He entered the company in 1799 with the purchase of one share and received two more shares in 1808 on the retirement of his father; in the same year he bought a share from his uncle, Robert Baldwin, and acquired the shares of Gillies, Weston, and Dyke in exchange for annuities of £15. This activity left Charles holding seven shares and Moody holding one share, and the joint-stock company continued with these two members until 1815, when Moody died and the Minutes ended. 10 The notebooks containing these Minutes of the joint-stock company are of recent discovery, and very little is known of their provenance beyond their purchase by a London antiquarian bookseller and their acquisition by an American university library. 11 They consist of three sturdy quarto volumes, the front flyleaf of the first volume bearing the notation "Minute Book S t . James's Chronicle May 15 th . 1761." The chronological contents of the books are as follows: Book A: Minutes of 161 meetings from 15 May 1761 through 29 June 1775 on 235 pages, and a copy of the Articles of Agreement on 21 pages. Book B: Minutes of 228 meetings from 31 August 1775 through 1 July 1795 on 358 pages. 12 Book C: Minutes of 154 meetings from 5 August 1795 through 9 August 1815 on 232 pages. The chirography throughout the Minutes is usually quite legible. All three volumes are bound in contemporary vellum, and it is perhaps partly for this reason that they are in extremely good condition particularly in respect of the long and frequent use they had under a number of hands and pens. The rights of ownership and the various procedures of the joint-stock company were set forth in the Articles of Agreement, which were probably prepared for the Proprietors by Baldwin with the aid of Lockyer Davis, who as a Proprietor of the Gazetteer was already familiar with the nature of such documents. 13 According to the Agreement there were twenty shares in the company, which had complete control over the paper. A Partner could hold more than one of the shares in his own name, and he was also permitted to hold one share or more in trust. On a Proprietor's wish to dispose of his holding the other Partners had a prior right to buy his share. The same priority held for purchasing the holding of a deceased member. If the Partners did not choose to purchase a vacated share, the executor or administrator could dispose of it to an outsider. The recent purchase of the three papers by Baldwin was noted, and the number of shares in the Chronicle held by each Proprietor was stated: Henry Baldwin, 3; Bonnell Thornton, 4; Ralph Griffiths, 3; Thomas Becket, 11/2; Thomas Davies, 2; Robert Davis, 1; Lockyer Davis, 2; Christopher Henderson, 1; Thomas Lowndes, 11/2; and William Jackson, 1. Of these twenty shares five were being held in trust. One share was kept by Baldwin for George Colman and another by Griffiths for John Berkenhout, both of whom accepted so promptly that they were virtually charter members of the company. Two of Thornton's four shares were held for an anonymous gentleman, and one share held in trust by Davies apparently went to Garrick at a time early but unannounced. In somewhat formal phrases the Articles attempted to provide a clear contract of ownership which stated the duties, rights, rules, and procedures of the Partners. The structure of the organization was a simple one. All members were expected to attend quarterly meetings, where they carried out the company's general business and named a special committee of five members to oversee the paper's financial affairs for the next quarter. This committee was supposed to meet every month to inspect the Printer's accounts and to transact any matters not needing action by the full membership. For a general meeting the Printer was required to send each Proprietor a written notice at least four days before the date or pay a forfeit of five shillings. In turn, the Proprietors were to pay a five-shilling forfeit for each absence and two shillings sixpence for tardiness. For committee meetings the fines were more modest—one shilling for both the Printer and the members. Other matters pertinent to the activities of the Partners were set down in the Agreement. For example, the vote of the majority was declared to be the rule, and the members were empowered to assess themselves for the expenses of publishing the paper. Proprietorship in any other evening triweekly newspaper was prohibited. 14 The holding of shares in trust by four of the members was ratified in the document; these members were not obliged to name the person or persons for whom they held shares, and they could "act in every Particular as if they were the Principals themselves." The Articles for the Chronicle , dated 9 March 1761, were signed by the ten members who owned or held all twenty shares. The Minutes themselves regularly began with a statement of the hour and date and place of the session as well as the names of the members present and absent. The business in hand was then examined, sometimes postponed, but usually resolved; however, the details of any discussion were rarely noted. The Minutes of a committee as a rule required no more than one page; the Minutes of a general meeting usually ran to two or three pages. The final item of business was a decision as to the location of the next meeting, which during the early years was often the Globe Tavern in Fleet Street or the Bedford Head, not too far from the Britannia Printing Office, where the Chronicle was being printed. 15 At the conclusion of a meeting the attending Partners signed the Minutes. Once a year the Printer entertained his colleagues with a haunch of venison, often at a Hampstead resort; at these gatherings the Proprietors enjoyed game and claret and informality without any records to be read or written. Whichever Proprietor had the task of writing the Minutes of the meetings, he did so in forthright phraseology without many attempts at embellishment. Any touch of levity or high spirits was quite rare and may sometimes have been slightly barbed. Once, when Griffiths was signing the committee's Minutes in August of 1775, he added after his name "a Lover of accuracy"; and when the Proprietors resolved on 6 September 1781 that certain bills should be discharged "at the Discretion of the Printer," the scribe inserted "indiscreet" before the word "Printer." In a few entries the Partners showed mild disapproval or even censure, but these were generally recorded with no real acrimony. In 1770, for example, the scribe noted a resolution that the Printer had been "very culpable in admitting the Theatrical Journal, N° 1, though at the repeated Instance of the whole Body of Partners, and that all future Numbers shall be omitted." But this passage was crossed through at the Printer's desire, and the revised resolution merely said that further publication of the offending department would be omitted. Three years later, when Lockyer Davis failed to attend a meeting held at the very place he had recommended, the other members of the committee, all six of them, resolved that their colleague should be "reprehended for such Neglect." 16 At times the Minutes were too elliptical for the sure comprehension of the present-day reader, who may find himself a little uncertain about reports that were no doubt completely clear to the Partners. If the Proprietors ever discussed the general editorial principles that they thought should be followed by the Chronicle , there is no evidence of such colloquies in the Minutes. Yet at times the Partners were quite explicit in their recommendations for the conduct of the paper. At their very first session they decided that prices of grain and the births and deaths from the weekly bills of mortality should be regularly inserted, and likewise the "List of Letters left at the General Post Office." Some years later they found it "adviseable to take the Proceedings of the House of Commons under the Title of Debates of the Representatives of the People of Utopia ." Again, much later, they resolved that "the Hague, the Amsterdam and the Brussels Gazettes be retained, and the other three foreign Prints rejected" and they further determined that all the country newspapers should be discontinued, "also the Portsmouth Correspondence, the Stocks List, Capt. Thompson's Paper, Mrs. Davies's d°., and Mr. W's Publick Adv r ." In 1790 a letter from a Mlle. Razalio was discussed, and Griffiths was authorized to inform her that her terms could not be accepted, "but if the S t . Ja s . Chronicle be worth her Acceptance, it shall be sent to her free of Expence, in the Hope only that she will now and then favour the Proprietors with her spontaneous Correspondence; a Circumstance which will be very pleasing to them, and which (as the Views of both coincide with respect to France) may probably be agreeable to her." 17 At the general meeting of 4 April 1792 an order was given for the agreement with the Paris correspondent to be discontinued "as speedily as may be"; however, at the following meeting this resolution was rescinded. Almost nowhere in their administrative concerns did the Proprietors show that they were affected by personality or sentiment, and only a few instances of true benevolence were recorded. On the recommendation of two Partners a feminine "Object of Pity" received a present of three guineas, name and reason unknown. 18 And either in gratitude or compassion on the first day of January 1794 the company voted the Printer's clerk a New Year's gift of five guineas. Perhaps it was their interest in healthy profits which led the Proprietors to issue warnings on the need for economy and make various specific suggestions. 19 Yet in spite of their concern over the outcome the Partners seem to have had little to do with the day-to-day business details of running the Chronicle . There is almost nothing in the Minutes about the costs of paper, printing, or selling although a rare kind of resolution was made on 10 June 1761 stating that the "Price for printing the first Thousand of the S t . James's Chronicle should be Three Pounds Seven Shillings." 20 There is very little about costs of professional services beyond references to paying the Editor and a few of the Partners. There is no summary of gross receipts from sales of the paper, no record of income from advertisements. At times, of course, Baldwin and his co-owners had to deal with questions faced by any newspaper publisher who remains awake to the need for improving promotion and distribution: they had to cope with hawkers, agents "to push our Papers," "returns" to carriers, and places for possible sales, including the provinces. 21 But unless there were serious problems for their intervention—and these did occur—the Partners apparently left things very much in the hands of Baldwin and Thomas, the expert men who were in charge. Because the attention of the Proprietors was fixed on dividends the Minutes of their meetings contain a history of early journalistic profits in a length and a detail apparently not heretofore available. A few somewhat similar files of newspaper archives before 1800 are already known and accessible, but they are much shorter than the present document, which covers a span of fifty-four uninterrupted years. 22 Of the hundreds of accounts of the Chronicle from 1763 to 1808 only one quarterly report and four monthly accounts were omitted without explanation—in 1764; in 1774 ( bis ), 1783, 1791—and it is probable that these lapses resulted from mere inadvertence. Such rarity and completeness make these Minutes doubly welcome in the study of journalistic history. In accordance with the procedure set down in the Articles of Agreement it was the Printer's practice to bring his records of operating expenses to monthly meetings, where the special committee checked over the accounts, corrected them, and recorded the current financial standing of the company. The kind of error uncovered in this examination was generally insignificant and the amount of money involved was very small, often no more than a few shillings and pence, but such corrections doubtless reassured the Partners that their vigilance was worth the trouble. At the quarterly general meetings the full membership of the company examined the closely related accounts, declared a dividend, stated the number of shares, determined the current value of a share, and made any large decisions necessary on such matters as the disposition of vacated shares or the settlement of a lawsuit. Any portion of the profits not used for the current dividends was carried forward as a balance and included in the report for the next period. Such quarterly differences between profits and dividends were generally under £100 and often in the area of £1 to £10. It appears that the Partners were usually anxious to declare as large a dividend as the profits safely allowed. When occasionally, say in times of plentitude, they carried forward a sizeable amount of money for the next period, they probably thought they saw stout contingencies ahead. With the Minutes of the Proprietors it is possible to follow the fiscal life of the Chronicle over a very long period and to observe this eminent paper as it suffered the changes of the moon and also the uneasy fortunes of journalistic business. The larger aspects of the company's finances may best be understood through a summary of the accounts of the Partners, who systematically recorded the profit or loss from the Chronicle , the regularity and the amount of the dividends, the number of shares and their value. In the beginning the paper was published at a loss for several quarters, and the Proprietors had to wait for more than a year before a dividend could be paid, but then a steady growth was achieved and by the year 1769 the profits reached £1,900. In the seventies the profits, despite several decreases, came to a total of about £18,000; the highest reach of annual profits occurred in the years 1772-1774, with a total of nearly £7,500. In the eighties there was a small decline to £16,000, but for the following decade these rich profits sank to some £12,000. Indeed, the nineties ended with a profit of less than £800 in each of the two final years. This decrease continued into the first years of the new century—in the years 1801-1807 (the last full years before the method of accounting was changed) the profits continued to drop, and by the end of the second quarter of 1808 they virtually disappeared. It was then that a general reorganization took place. The monthly accounts were discontinued, and the reckonings were made on the basis of semiannual reports instead of the quarterly accounts; but this was no more than a simplification in the bookkeeping. At the same time the acquisition of another triweekly, the London Evening Post , for £1,550 23 and the new management by Charles Baldwin produced a vigorous advance in the profits, which for the last six years of the Minutes amounted to £6,000. The total profits reported from 1761 to 1815 were approximately £65,000, a figure substantially larger than the total dividends because a number of quarterly dividends were omitted and also because any balance remaining after payment of a quarterly dividend was carried over to the next period and thus was included more than once in the statement of profits. The joint-stock company had two other sources of income to add to the profits realized from the newspaper. The most substantial supplement was the money received from the sale of shares either to a new member buying into the company or to a Proprietor acquiring an additional share. This kind of revenue, of course, depended on the longevity and the varying desires of the Proprietors. The other source of sizeable additional revenue was the government, which for a time paid the Chronicle an annual subsidy of £200. It is recorded elsewhere that the paper received this benefit for several years toward the end of the century, but no mention of it appears in the Minutes. 24 The first and last goal of the joint-stock company was a good income from dividends, an amount which the Proprietors determined at regular intervals by the simple process of dividing the number of active shares into some portion of the current quarterly profits. After a cautious beginning the dividends rose steadily but not at an equal pace. Sometimes omitting or postponing a dividend was considered necessary, even though unpleasant for the Proprietors. However, from the quarter when the first dividend was declared to the time when quarterly dividends were abandoned, payments were bypassed for only fifteen of the 184 quarters. A specific reason was cited for most of these omissions: in four cases the money was required to pay the penalties of lawsuits, in five to purchase the holdings of a colleague, and in one case to compensate for bad debts. 25 For the other cases the records merely state that a dividend has been deferred or that the accounts of two quarters have been combined; either statement said the same thing to the disappointed Partners. 26 Before the end of the first decade the quarterly dividend reached the £15-to-£25 level, where it remained for many years with occasional points of variance along the route. In 1788, when the purchase money from four new Partners was included in the profits, the highest quarterly dividend in the history of the Chronicle was issued, £108; the highest quarterly dividend without special benefit was £36 in 1795. Such evidence of prosperity was happily maintained until almost the end of the century, but then for a decade the dividends followed the profits in a steady decline; indeed, during the years from 1803 through 1807 the dividends were twice omitted and in only one quarter exceeded £10, and for the other quarters during that period the dividends averaged only £6. With the purchase of the rival London Evening Post in 1809 and with the enterprise of a new Printer the dividends during the final years of the Minutes generally exceeded £60 for half a year, and the annual figure rivaled that of most of the early years. Over the whole period of the Minutes the amount paid in dividends to all the Proprietors was £50,000. In the beginning of the joint-stock company Baldwin had, in accordance with the Articles of Agreement, "divided the said property into twenty equal shares," all bought or held in trust by the original Proprietors; the number of shares remained at twenty until 1768. In that year, with the death of Thornton, it dropped to eighteen, and thereafter it fluctuated, up to nineteen, down to eighteen, down and up and down but never again reaching the original number. After the bankruptcies of Davies and Becket and the deaths of Garrick, Robert Davis, and Lowndes the number of shares was reduced to fourteen. The descent was halted in 1788 by the admission of four members, Gillies, Moody, Skinner, and Young, but then came a period with more deaths than admissions, bringing the number of shares in 1807 to only eight, the final figure in the Minutes, held by two Partners. What was the effect of such fluctuation on the stock company? The shares which had "fallen in" were of course available for purchase, and it would seem reasonable to assume that the shareholders might relish the extra income from such sales. On the other hand, dormant shares received no dividends so they did not have to be taken into account when the profits were divided; the fewer the shares, the larger the dividend for each Proprietor. However, this quandary between getting more money one way or getting it another was apparently not a real dilemma. The serious problem lay in the fact that the success of the paper manifestly waned with the century and acceptable eager Partners were not plentiful. The system of issuing shares which were owned or held by a variable number of Proprietors was, of course, central to the joint-stock organization. The virtual disintegration of this structure began in 1808, when Charles Baldwin suddenly, through gift, exchange, and purchase, became the owner of seven of the eight shares then current. For seven years he and Christopher Moody maintained this lopsided situation with comfortable profits and infrequent meetings. Then after Moody's death at the end of 1815, the Minutes stopped, without giving any reason or suggesting any new status for the joint-stock company. Presumably the company, being reduced to one member, went out of existence. In any case, the St. James's Chronicle continued as a prominent newspaper well past the middle of the nineteenth century. The value of a share of stock was regularly set by the Proprietors at a general meeting and became as reliable a barometer of the well-being of the company as the dividends. After all, who would better know the Chronicle's financial situation? The evaluation began with the modest sum of 25 guineas for one share, in several years grew at a rightly progressive rate to £125, £150, £175, £200, and £250, and then settled on 300 pounds or guineas for some twenty years. In 1791 the system was changed: instead of setting the value of one share the Proprietors determined the total current value of the paper, and the worth of a single share could easily be arrived at by dividing the number of extant shares into the total value. This value was set at £6,300 in 1791. Thereafter the figure went down steadily until in 1809 the total value was only £600. The purchase of the London Evening Post then brought the value up to £3,000 and then to £4,000. Whichever method was used for stating the worth of the company—listing the value either of an individual share or of the whole property—such evaluation presumably gave a note of stability and continuity and perhaps pride. The last meeting of the Partners to be recorded was that of 9 August 1815, when the two remaining men resolved that the value "for the current six months to the next Half Yearly meeting be 3700£." Thus the Minutes in this prolonged series expired in the midst of futurity. In considering the Chronicle as an investment each Proprietor had several expenditures to take into account. In the beginning there were the costs of establishing the new enterprise: each share was assessed £12/10/0 for the purchase of the three journals from William Rayner, 27 and five guineas per share were twice required, as set down in the Articles and at the third meeting of the Partners, in order to pay the initial demands of operation. Thus for an investment of only £23 a Proprietor was eligible for the benefits that presumably lay ahead for members of the joint-stock company. He would also be liable for further assessments and would have to accept the possibility that dividends might be postponed or omitted. Thirty years after the paper began, each shareholder was in fact assessed £96/18/5 1/2 per share to provide the £1,260 due the executors of Lockyer Davis and Dr. Berkenhout. 28 And in 1804 and 1806 lists of "bad or very doubtful debts" amounting to about £105 were debited in due proportion to each Partner. 29 Corporate expenditures that were not charged to individual accounts included the loss of a considerable sum on the Yearly Chronicle , the purchase of the London Evening Post , and a total of about £1,200 for fines and legal expenses. Even so, the Chronicle was a profitable undertaking. If any Proprietor could have lived long enough to hold one share from the time when the newspaper was founded to the end of these Minutes, he would have received dividends totaling about £3,600 on his original investment. Moreover, each Partner knew that at his retirement or death the established value of his holdings would be awarded to the proper heirs, a kind of inevitable dividend. All in all, it would seem that the owners of the Chronicle made an excellent investment. Besides their regular duties of determining profits, dividends, and value the Proprietors often had other matters to consider. One of these had to do with the advertisements which were printed in the paper. They must have been a source of considerable income, but they sometimes involved the Partners in the collection of bad debts and even exposed them to court action. Notices of various commodities and services, including many announcements of new books and current plays, appeared frequently in the Chronicle , but all of them did not represent income since some were placed by the Partners, who had voted themselves limited free space on payment of no more than the tax levied on advertisements by the government. However, although precise receipts were never stated in the Minutes at any time, the liberal number of insertions, the experience of contemporaries as shown in their few extant records, and the rather frequent references in the Minutes to the advertising make their importance apparent. The Chronicle's charge for advertisements was early recorded as five shillings for the first twenty lines in Long Primer type and one shilling for six additional lines and in Brevier four shillings for the first twenty-four lines and one shilling for eight additional lines "at least as near to this Rule as may be." Several years later the rate for Long Primer was revised to four shillings for every advertisement of twenty lines and one shilling for eight more lines. 30 Whatever the rule, the question of how to collect the money due the paper for advertisements was a recurring topic at the meetings of the Proprietors. In 1770 the Printer was instructed not to take advertisements without ready money "in any Case where it can be avoided," and a person was recommended "to collect the outstanding Debts for Advert s ." In April of the next year the Printer "produced a List of Debts outstanding for Advertisements amounting to £222/0/11, to Christmas last." The following year, in a case that evidently required special tact, a bill and receipt were authorized to be sent to the great Wilkes for his advertising indebtedness, and the Editor was desired to deliver them "in such Way as his Discretion shall dictate." 31 Advertisements for two lotteries gave particular trouble. The Adelphi Lottery was the project of the Adam brothers, who as architects and promoters had erected more buildings than they could sell. They successfully petitioned Parliament for permission to conduct a lottery which would dispose of the property and thus benefit their creditors. In 1773-74 the Chronicle carried a number of notices for the sale of the lottery tickets, and the bill against the Messrs. Adam became considerable and remained unpaid, so in a moment of adventure the Proprietors directed the Printer to send to the House of Adam for an Adelphi Lottery ticket "on Acc t . for the General Concern of the Proprietors." Ticket No. 1928 was duly procured, but the Minutes say nothing about the outcome of this little flutter. 32 A number of years later the paper was the object of a suit for inserting advertisements for a dubious lottery; the Partners quickly resolved that "the irregular Lottery Adver ts . from Shergold &amp; C°. &amp; other Advertisers, be rejected till the Legality of their Advertisements shall have been ascertained." 33 A lesser but frequent embarrassment was related to errors in casting up the advertisements and paying the duty to the Crown; these errors were regularly found and corrected by the Partners delegated to examine the accounts. 34 Another area which had to be dealt with by the Proprietors concerned various lawsuits against the Printer of the Chronicle . Indeed, the largest expenditures not directly related to the costs of publishing the paper were bred by legal proceedings, i.e. the fines and the legal fees resulting from suits brought by individuals and prosecutions initiated by the government. The first important conflict with the law began after the issue of 18 May 1765, which had described a public disorder of massive dimensions involving the poor London weavers, who were actively protesting their current plight. According to the Chronicle "About Two o'Clock a Message was delivered them from the Lords, signifying that they could not proceed to the Re-consideration of their Grievances 'till next Session, when every possible Step should be taken for their Advantage." This report of the episode appears to have been published without prejudice, but the House of Lords summoned Henry Woodfall of the Public Advertiser , Henry Baldwin, and Charles Say of the Gazetteer to explain such a breach of privilege. Woodfall gave the Chronicle as his source, Baldwin said he copied the piece from the Gazetteer , Say pleaded the cause of "a Family of Six Children," and each printer was fined £100. Another paragraph in the same issue of the Chronicle reflecting on a Member of the House of Lords brought another fine of £100 for Baldwin. 35 These two fines plus expenses, a total of £225/10/8, were of course paid by the Proprietors and recorded in the Minutes of 24 June 1765. This was no light penalty, but the Chronicle did not change its course. Late in 1769 the Chronicle printed a communication which proved offensive to the government. A mischievous collaboration of George III, Lord North, and Chief Justice Mansfield had challenged the right of the press to print what the public should know of public affairs, and the fearless but careful letters of Junius had been appearing in sharp reply, mostly in the Public Advertiser . On 19 December the Advertiser published one of these letters, the one ending with an appropriate caveat which has often been quoted and as often praised: "The Prince, who imitates their [the Stuarts'] conduct, should be warned by their example; and, while he plumes himself upon the security of his title to the crown, should remember that, as it was acquired by one revolution, it may be lost by another." 36 This Letter to the King immediately became so popular that a special edition of the Public Advertiser was needed, and many members of the contemporary press promptly reprinted it, including such different papers as Say's Gazetteer , John Miller's London Evening Post , George Robinson's Independent Chronicle , John Almon's London Museum , and the St. James's Chronicle . The government took action against the printers. The Letter had appeared in the Chronicle on 21 December 1769; the first sign of the case in the Minutes appeared two months later, when the Proprietors decided to employ Mr. Hearne as their attorney. Lord Mansfield, the presiding Judge at the trial, made it clear that he would decide whether the Letter was criminal in its substance and that the jury would decide only whether the defendant had published the suspect document. Almon was found guilty; Woodfall was granted a new trial which was never held; Miller and Baldwin were found not guilty; Say and Robinson were apparently never tried. 37 A fortnight after Baldwin's trial the Proprietors resolved to take the opinion of Mr. Serjeant John Glynn, the eminent representative of the defendants, as to "whether a fair Action will lie against the Attorney General, for the Expence of the late prosecution." Months later the paper paid £88/5/10 for these expenses. And then the paper paid the balance of Mr. Hearne's bill, amounting to £17/7/10 and also the fees of £7 to the officers of Commons. The four allusions in the Minutes to this suit show a distinct emphasis on the financial aspects. 38 Whatever the Partners may have said at their meetings, the Minutes reflect no sense of pride in the affair, nor is there any statement of general policy on such matters. The Proprietors could not know the great height of the drama in which their newspaper had had a part, nor did they record any recognition as men of honor as well as of business that the "Letter" they had printed was actually a conjunction of high prose and true democratic spirit. The next prominent suit was brought in King's Bench by John Elphinston, Captain in the Royal Navy. He had been present at the capture of Quebec and for several years served as Rear Admiral in the Russian navy, and had become an object of both English and Russian criticism. In its issue of 29 January 1774 the Chronicle printed a letter directed to the Earl of Sandwich, the inadequate First Lord of the Admiralty, and signed "Commissioned Officers, but neither Profligates, nor Huntingdonshire Voters." The letter asked Lord Sandwich what were his reasons "for appointing a Man to the Command of one of the most capital of his Majesty's Ships, who has behaved notoriously ill in a neighbouring Service, and been dismissed from it with Ignominy? Besides which your Lordship cannot be ignorant of the Insults he offered to the brave Admiral who commanded at Portsmouth, and to the British Fleet, when this Man was there with a Squadron of Russian Ships some few Years ago." For printing and publishing this "libel," which hurt and injured the naval officer in his "Character and Reputation amongst diverse of his Majesty's Officers and other good and worthy Subjects of this Realm," Henry Baldwin was found guilty by a jury which took a quarter of an hour from a July day to make its decision. Damages were set at £500, with £38 more for costs and charges. 39 The Proprietors of the Chronicle had to make adjustments in their dividends in order to pay this heavy penalty, the largest such loss the paper suffered. 40 Another suit of consequence involved a matter of international, or rather inter-English, relations. The difficulties fostered by the Crown with the American colonies were producing a strong feeling against the war and a strong sympathy among many Englishmen with their cousins across the ocean. One of the protesters who acted vigorously was John Horne. A former clergyman who was a friend of John Wilkes, Horne was the sort of person who devotes himself to common causes and is sometimes carelessly accused of radicalism or even treason. As an Englishman with a head for political theory he could see that the Americans were asking only for the practice of English principles, and when he inserted a signed advertisement in several leading papers on 9 and 10 June 1775, all London was made acquainted with a special circumstance in a familiar context. The notice, which came from the King's Arms Tavern, Cornhill, reported that a member of the Constitutional Society had proposed a subscription of £100 for the relief of widows, orphans, and aged parents "of our BELOVED American Fellow Subjects, who, FAITHFUL to the Character of Englishmen, preferring Death to Slavery, were, for that Reason only, inhumanly murdered by the KING's Troops at or near Lexington and Concord in the Province of Massachusetts on the 19th of last April." Subscriptions were to be paid to the account of Dr. Franklin. On 18 July, Horne inserted another small advertisement to say that £50 had been raised. Some months later the government prosecuted him for libel along with the printers of the Chronicle and other selected offending papers. Each printer was fined £100 and Horne twice that amount with an imprisonment of one year. 41 As usual, the comments in the Minutes of the Proprietors were brief and factual—two years after the original offense the Printer reported he had been given notice to attend the Court of King's Bench to receive judgment, and the next month a dividend was omitted because of the "Expence of £220/14/0 being incurred by a Law Suit, and some other Charges." 42 After this celebrated case Horne became more and more active in politics, was tried for treason and acquitted, and was refused the seat in Parliament he had won by election; he published works of philology, became well known among writers of a liberal bent, and added the name of Tooke to his own. John Horne Tooke had the honor of being the central figure in this celebrated state trial, and the Partners of the Chronicle had the memory of printing some thirty lines for him. The final case of mark was the affair of the Russian Ambassador, a matter involving the old problem of diplomatic privilege. On 20 January 1781 the Chronicle reported conferences between Lord Viscount Stormont, one of the Secretaries of State, and His Excellency John Simolin, Her Russian Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. According to this report "the Ministry have had Reason to suspect his Excellency to be little better than a Spy , and last Week had the good Fortune to get at a Packet of his"; as a consequence he "was charged with living here in the Habit of furnishing the Enemies of Great Britain with Intelligence." 43 This sort of scandal would be embarrassing for Secretaries, Ambassadors, Catherine the Great, and George III. The printer of the Chronicle and the printers of six other offending papers were ordered to attend in the Court of King's Bench to answer the charges of libel. All the other printers received sentences of fines and imprisonment, and one was also ordered to stand in the pillory. Baldwin, "making it appear, he had used every Endeavour in his Power to atone for having indiscretely copied the offensive Article in Question, . . . was fined £100 without any Imprisonment." 44 Twice the Partners gave their attention to this case but only to record the expenses of the suit; 45 any interest they had in diplomatic immunity or Muscovite relations did not enter the Minutes. The Proprietors of this distinguished journal, at times beleaguered and unjustly prosecuted, corporately dealt only with the expenses of Justice. 46 Although the chief enterprise of the joint-stock company was the St. James's Chronicle , which had replaced the triweekly St. James's Evening Post , the Proprietors were also responsible for the two other newspapers bought from Rayner, the London Spy and Read's Weekly Journal . 47 The purchase of all three papers was duly recorded in the Articles of Agreement, but the Minutes mention only a few details about the two weeklies. In April 1761, soon after their purchase, they were issued as a single Saturday paper with their titles combined, and thereafter the status of this weekly was sometimes noted at meetings of the Proprietors. Apparently the hybrid did not flourish. According to two early entries in the Minutes it was in arrears by nearly £10, and even though this deficit was much less than the loss which was currently being reported for the Chronicle , the Partners soon found a remedy. 48 At their general meeting for 16 December they altered the title of the Spy-Journal to Baldwin's London Journal: or, British Weekly Chronicle . At the same time, making sure that at least some of the best content would remain the same, they agreed that the paper should continue printing the essay signed by the name of Simon Gentle Touch. The "new" eight-page Saturday paper first appeared on 2 January 1762. The second issue contained an announcement of other developments—a statement, signed by M. Mechell and repeated for two months, declaring that Mechell's Weekly Chronicle and The Old British Spy had both been disposed of to Baldwin and had been united by him with the Spy-Journal to form the new weekly paper. 49 Baldwin's London Journal was not unlike other weekly papers which printed news or other material extracted from contemporaries of greater frequency, thus satisfying readers in town and country who were content with one newspaper a week. It was Baldwin's procedure which was unusual. He relied in the main on the other paper he published, and for the most part he limited the content of the Journal to selections from the Chronicle . Ten years earlier Charles Say had founded the Craftsman; or Gray's Inn Journal as a weekly compilation of his own daily Gazetteer and had thus provided a ready prototype for Baldwin's London Journal . 50 According to the accounts in the Proprietors' Minutes the profits of the new paper during the first year came to £4. The profits gradually grew so that for the next four years the average profit was £7 per quarter, a satisfactory sum but far smaller than that of the triweekly Chronicle . At the end of 1766 the Partners voted to make the paper over to Baldwin, giving him the liberty of returning it if "he should not think it worth his while to continue the same." 51 But Baldwin kept the journal for many years, and the Minutes had no more to say about it. The Proprietors were involved with another publication whose brief existence is also noted in the Minutes— The Yearly Chronicle . A more than ample description of this octavo work is found in its alternate title—"A Collection of The most interesting and striking Essays, Letters, &amp;c. which appeared in the S t . James's Chronicle for that Year. To which is added, A Diary of the most remarkable Events. The Whole serving as A Complete Register of the Politics, News, Literature, &amp;c. of that Period." It was printed in 1762 not for all the Proprietors but for only seven of them, along with C. Reymers in Holborn. The selections in the Yearly Chronicle cover 414 pages, about two pages to the item, and relate to lords and gentry, plays and the theatre, and such varied topics as clubs, almanacs, taxes, sham auctions, city smarts, mad oxen, and smoky chimneys; this gallimaufry appeared in essays, letters, poems, tales, and Characters, in prose and a sprinkling of verse. The second part, in sixty-two pages, is a register of events, mostly trivial and very dull. The reprinting of letters or essays from a single journal had had a mild popularity, but the reprinting of items miscellaneous in form and content from the same journal of the same year was a rare project and evidently an unsuccessful one. The Minutes show to what extent the Yearly Chronicle was not a happy venture. Two and a half years after it appeared, Baldwin reported to the Partners that Thornton and the gentleman for whom he held a share in trust had suffered a large loss by publishing the volume. Two months later the Printer produced an account showing that 899 copies of the work remained unsold. The Partners resolved to dispose of them to Becket for £21 and to cover the loss of £72/0/9 with funds from the Chronicle ; they later deducted the amount from the January-March profits in 1765. 52 It seems that no further volumes were issued. Such were the minor publications created in the shadow of the Chronicle —one a weekly compilation which continued for years under Baldwin, the other an annual which existed for only one year. Official records of the profit or loss of a prominent newspaper over many years give authentic information about the paper itself and also offer fruitful hints about the fluctuations of the times in which it appeared. Consequently these Minutes of some 500 meetings of the Chronicle's Proprietors covering more than half a century can be of special benefit to students of economic history or of the press because the statistics about the paper can be examined in the frame of such a long span of years. Terse, sober, and systematic, the Minutes provide in methodical detail the Chronicle's shaky beginning and early struggles, its experiments, changes, and improvements, its long success and decline and recovery. The Minutes also contain various other notes of much value though in less abundance. The Proprietors themselves seem to have been scrupulous and fair-minded men who took on varying degrees of responsibility for their mutual undertaking. Some of them attended the meetings of the company irregularly while others gave much time and energy to the enterprise. Meeting and planning together month after month after month over a number of years, they practiced the rules of a joint-stock company in a period when that kind of organization was apparently rare in newspaper publishing. Many of the circumstances of maintaining the stock company—the occasional need to recruit new members, the changes resulting from death and retirement, and the individual relations both familial and professional—required the regular attention of the Partners. Some of the problems they encountered were solvable; others were stubborn and recurring. Advertising in several phases was a frequent topic, and the government's disciplinary attention to the press was ever a matter of concern. The scarcity of such records as are contained in these early Minute Books of the St. James's Chronicle adds to their importance as archives which are exceptional in their length and their usefulness as a fiscal calendar kept with industry and judgment. The men of affairs who were financially accountable for the paper wrote here their own lengthy chronicle of the business life of this notable and prosperous newspaper.</field>

Haig, The Gazetteer, 1735-1797 (1960), pp. 270-276. 14 Richard Baldwin disposed of his share in the triweekly London Evening Post before his admission as a Proprietor of the Chronicle : Minutes, 25 October 1764. Becket, Thomas, Richard Baldwin, Garrick, and possibly Colman held shares in the daily Public Advertiser : B.M. Add. MS. 38,169, f. 24; Letters of David Garrick , ed. David M. Little and George M. Kahrl (1963), Letter 754; Lucyle Werkmeister, The London Daily Press (1963), pp. 65-66. A number of the Proprietors of the Chronicle were also Partners in the London Packet : see below, note 22. Apparently these two journals were closely related; in the Minutes of 28 December 1769 the Partners resolved "that the Deduction on Acct. of the London Packet be given Credit for on settling the Account for the Month of December." 15 Later the King's Head became the favorite location for many years and was finally and properly succeeded by the Queen's Head in Southampton Street. There were many other locations, including the Crown and Anchor in the Strand, Don Saltero's Coffeehouse in Chelsea, and the Shakespeare Tavern in Covent Garden.

      <field name="heading_text">Further Texts of Chaucer's Minor Poems by A. I. Doyle and George B. Pace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Speculum for January 1969 Robert E. Nichols, Jr., publishing transcriptions of manuscripts of Chaucer's Fortune, Truth , and Gentilesse , remarks: "the following transcriptions . . . are probably not only the last unpublished manuscript versions of the three works, but the final unpublished manuscripts of Chaucer's Short Poems." 1 Professor Nichols subtitles his article: "The 'Last' Unpublished Manuscript Transcriptions." Ironically, at the very time the article came out Norman Davis published his transcription of a newly discovered manuscript of Gentilesse (Nottingham MS.), 2 and in the previous year we noted the existence of an unpublished copy of Truth in the same manuscript and of the A B C in the Melbourne MS 3 . We do not say that the transcriptions we publish in this paper are the final transcriptions. We do say that they are the principal unpublished manuscripts of the Short Poems known to us which we consider definitely worth publishing (but see section V below). A manuscript of these poems is worth publishing if it can be called "a genuine witness" (Davis's phrase; p. 46); that is, if it is a valid manuscript, not, say, a mere copy of some early printed text. 4 In the 19th century the Chaucer Society published transcriptions of nearly all of the manuscripts of Chaucer's Short Poems. Since then Chaucerians have kept adding to the collection so that we now have in print for these poems a corpus scriptorum which is perhaps unique in medieval English literature. Of what other group of poems extant in a large number of manuscripts, even poems by Chaucer, can it be said: all the manuscript evidence is available for the student? In this paper we publish transcriptions of the version of the A B C in the Melbourne MS. (State Library of Victoria, Felton Bequest, Deguileville in English), of Truth in the Nottingham University Library MS. ME LM 1 (Mellish), and of Against Women Unconstant (probably by Chaucer) 5 in Fairfax 16, Bodleian. 6 None has been published before; the Fairfax copy is the best version of that poem. In parts I-III we comment on the manuscripts themselves; in part IV we give the transcriptions along with brief statements of textual affiliations; in part V we list additional unpublished manuscripts of the Short Poems and also early printed copies with claim to manuscript authority. Parts I-III are by A. I. Doyle. This introduction and parts IV-V are by George B. Pace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The Melbourne text of the A B C (like five other copies) is in a manuscript of the English prose version of Deguileville's Pilgrimage of the Manhood , followed by that of his Pilgrimage of the Soul , which has been described at some length by Dr. K. V. Sinclair. 7 This is the only surviving volume known to me in which the two occur together, 8 but there was a copy of the two together in the collection of Henry Savile of Banke (W. Yorks., d. 1617) 9 which could have been the same as another in the library of the Earl of Kingston, said to have been destroyed by fire in 1745. 10 The Savile manuscript is said in his catalogues to have been written or compiled by John Lacy, Dominican friar and anchorite of Newcastle upon Tyne, who wrote and illuminated an extant Latin and English volume sometime between 1420 and 1434, and owned a copy of the earlier version of the Wycliffite New Testament. 11 Like Lacy's, apparently, the Melbourne manuscript treats the two Pilgrimages as the first and second book of one work, to which it gives the title Grace Dieu , the name of the pilgrim's guide in the Manhood , but somewhat paradoxically attached in other surviving manuscripts not to that but to the Soul , where that personification plays a smaller part. 12 The texts are also peculiar in that the Manhood contains another poem 13 as well as Chaucer's A B C , and the Soul eight extra (likewise unknown elsewhere) besides the usual fourteen, to three of which there are additional stanzas. 14 The prose of the Soul is modified to accommodate these hymns, especially at the end, where other copies vary considerably, some giving the date 1413 and a translator's colophon with the cryptogram Ak, not found in Melbourne. 15 The additional verse in both Pilgrimages , strongly latinate in its vocabulary, derivative from liturgical sources, is not very different from the usual pieces in the Soul which have been attributed to Thomas Hoccleve because of the occurrence of one of them in his autograph collection, Huntington HM 111, where there is nothing attributable to anyone else. 16 It may, however, have been appropriated for the Soul (as, presumably, Chaucer's A B C was for the Manhood ) with the others made to match, and so too the Melbourne imitations. Whether John Lacy was responsible for the last is an open question; the English of his extant writing is not consistently or strongly northern and could have been modified by re-copying. The language of the Melbourne manuscript has been assigned to Lincolnshire, 17 and the writing of the main scribe, who signs himself Benett, is probably of the second quarter of the fifteenth century or thereabouts, a very well-formed even cursiva anglicana formata with an admixture of letter-forms from secretary script (occasional alternative simple a, g constantly and final s usually). 18 Although his þ and y are quite distinct, he sometimes oddly uses the former in initial positions for the latter. One leaf only, the first of the Pilgrimage of the Soul (folio 96), is by another hand, a good set secretary of the second or third quarter of the century with alternative reversed e from anglicana , and its orthography also appropriate to Lincolnshire. It matches Benett in having high decorative whiplike ascenders in the top line and "secundus liber prima pars" as a running title (both f. 96 v ), but the spaces left for an opening rubric, miniature and decorated initials are not filled, as they are in the rest of the volume with pen-drawings of an expressive unpretentious style and standard blue and red flourished penwork initials, to complete a piece of very competent provincial book-production. 19 The drawings seem to be independent of those in other copies of the Pilgrimages , which deserve further study. Sir John Rouclyff of Cowthorpe (W. Yorks., d. 1531), whose name is on the book, was bequeathed by his father Sir Brian in 1495 all his English, Latin and French books, and his father, Guy (d. 1460), could have been its first owner in regard to date, though his will is silent. 20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The Mellish manuscript, deposited in Nottingham University Library (Me LM1), has been recently discussed by Professor Norman Davis (see fn. 2 above), but his first-hand description is confined to the one page (f. 20 r ) containing the poems he prints and he refers to Henry Bradshaw for a fuller account of the volume and to Brown and Robbins for the other English verse therein. Each of these is however incomplete and it is possible to say something more about the relationship of the English contents to the rest of the manuscript and its background. The book is made up of good membrane leaves of the best matt finish, measuring about 15 x 101/2 inches, and includes a Sarum kalendar, hours of the Blessed Virgin, vigils of the dead, a liturgical psalter, with litanies and prayers, and Originalia doctorum (i.e. quotations from Bernard, Augustine, Jerome and others)—all in Latin except for an English rubric; 21 and several English pieces before and after the kalendar, some uniform in style of script and decoration with the remainder of the volume, but others obviously added later in spaces left blank. The illumination of the first page of the hours (f. 21 r ), incorporating the arms of the Harpur family in what seems to be the original work, is a good specimen of a style current in the second quarter and middle of the fifteenth century, with which that on other pages agrees. 22 The same escutcheon appears however to be a subsequent addition to the first page of the psalter (f. 79 r ), where there is also a miniature of King David in original illumination of the same period. The litany after the psalms and canticles invokes a number of relatively unusual Anglo-Saxon and more recent English saints, whom it is not easy to connect with a single locality or particular interest, though they suggest a deliberate choice. 23 The second portion of the volume may therefore have been adapted, not made or completed like the first portion, for John Harpur, who gave it and other books for use in the chapel he endowed at Rushall (Staffordshire), his wife's ancestral home. 24 The English verses which explain his intentions are written on the page (f. 20 v ) facing the first of the hours, in a fine large text-hand, with alternate lines in different colours and decorated initials matching those of the preceding kalendar and of the rest of the volume. Latin verses in the kalendar concerning the consecration of the church "et locus extra", 1440, added by a similar textura quadrata , provide a terminus for the assembly and assignment of the whole book, which is not contradicted by any other internal or external evidence, but its main parts could have been commissioned or procured up to ten years previously, and possibly from London rather than from a provincial shop, in view of the standards of execution and the spelling of the original English contents. The leaves (ff. 1-5 r ) before the kalendar are ruled in two columns and contain, in a proficient small text-hand, with initials and paraphs flourished in an equally expert mid-fifteenth century manner, like those of the bulk of the volume, in verse the Dietary , the Kings of England up to Henry VI (with space originally left at the end for continuation), and three stanzas from the Fall of Princes , 25 all by Lydgate but not ascribed here; and a prose history of the Russhale family from the Norman Conquest until the marriage of Eleanor, the heiress, with John Harpur, and her parents' deaths. 26 The dates of the latter (1429-30) are amongst entries in the kalendar by a cursive hand which resembles that responsible for the copy of Chaucer's Gentilesse and the Proverbs on f. 20 r (judged to be mid to late fifteenth-century by Professor Davis), and it could be William Ball's, first Harpur chaplain and vicar of Rushall, whose own death in 1455 is recorded by another hand. The copy of Chaucer's Truth and a further stanza from Lydgate's Fall 27 occupy the space on f. 2 v originally left vacant after the Kings and Fall stanzas. Both are in a different convention of script from that of the other additions: a "bastard anglicana" which combines the vertical and rectilinear characteristics, broken strokes and angular feet, and some of the letter-forms (d, g, final s) of text-hand, with the looped or hooked ascenders (b, h, k, l), long f, r and s, and other forms (D, S, e, w) from traditional English cursive. 28 "Le bon councell de Chawcer" is in fact written in the margin in a smaller and less bastard style, though probably by the same hand; and in the second column, while the title, "A Balade for dysceyuors", is in textura , the Lydgate stanza itself is in a less emphatic version of bastard anglicana , though still apparently by the same scribe. There is not perfect regularity or evenness in the performance of either mode, but it is competent enough to make arguable an identification with the scribe of f. 20 r , whose ink at least is similar. 29 Filling up the space at the end of the Kings might imply that it was done before Henry VI's first deposition in 1461 or his death in 1471, after each of which continuation stanzas were composed, yet not necessarily available everywhere and not often added to existing copies. 30 Altogether it is likely that the copy of Truth is of the same era as that of Gentilesse , both added to the Mellish (Nottingham) manuscript after its chaining in the church at Rushall, by a versatile amateur hand, perhaps of one of the clergy or family, in augmentation of an anthology which had a distinctly secular as well as a religious aim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The physical features and textual relationships of Bodleian MS. Fairfax 16 have been most fully discussed by Miss E. P. Hammond and A. A. Brusendorff. 31 They have shown how this collection of long and short Chaucerian and post-Chaucerian poems is made up of separable booklets, of one or more quires each, corresponding partly in contents (though not precisely in order) with those of Tanner 346, also divisible into separate booklets, Bodley 638 and Digby 181, the so-called Oxford or Hammond group with a common ancestry from which they derive some unique and rare texts. A structure of such booklets, as in the mid-fourteenth century Auchinleck manuscript or the productions of the later fifteenth-century heirs of John Shirley, is often taken to imply commercial pre-fabrication, ready for selection and combination to the taste and purse of various purchasers. 32 That Fairfax 16 was completed in this way from ready-made elements, rather than commissioned from the start by its purchaser, is indicated by the fact that the illustration opposite the opening of Chaucer's Mars and Venus , the first text, is on the last page of two preceding quires otherwise left blank (except for the added list of contents), as were two at the end of the volume, presumably meant for further augmentation of the anthology, to some extent carried out in the later fifteenth and the sixteenth century. The full-page miniature (with considerable historical and iconographical interest) and the accompanying illuminated sprays, which incorporate the armorial bearings of one of the Stanley family, are stylistically of the second quarter or so of the fifteenth century and of a high (probably metropolitan) standard. 33 The membrane of the bulk of the book, however, is not of the highest quality (being smooth and wavy, not matt and flat, and sometimes flawed), and the hand responsible for all the original contents, a fluent, clear, well-punctuated and apparently accurate mixed cursive, with fere-textura or bastard headings, is modest in comparison with the illumination. 34 The copying can also be assigned to the second quarter of the century, not earlier, from details of the script and the authorship of some of the contents. 35 The date 1450 on the manuscript has generally been accepted as contemporary evidence, and a terminus ante . Although the first owners may have been from Cheshire, 36 the language as well as the decoration suggests London as the place of origin. The copyist of the Fairfax booklets may well have used more than one similar set as his source, to judge from the recurrence and rearrangement of the texts in different surviving manuscripts. The amount of activity implied, and the accessibility of authoritative (even unfinished) Chaucerian originals, point in the same direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV In the transcriptions below the abbreviations are expanded without italics. The brief statements of affiliation which precede the transcriptions are expressed in terms of Robinson's The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer (see fn. 5 above), Textual Notes, pp. 915-920. We believe this to be the edition most likely to be compared. Our intention is not to give a full treatment of the textual problems involved, which could not be done in the space available to us. An A B C . Chaucer's A B C survives in 16 manuscript copies and in Speght's printed edition of 1602. 37 Robinson views the authorities as comprising two groups, an α and a β. The group with which the Melbourne copy is affiliated is the β: Additional 36983, British Museum; Cambridge University Library Ff. 5. 30; Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, U. 3. 12; St. John's College, Cambridge, G. 21; Laud Misc. 740, Bodleian; Sion College, London, Arc. L.40.2/E.44. Except for the first, these texts all appear in manuscripts of the Middle English prose version of Deguileville's Pèlerinage de la Vie Humaine . As the Melbourne copy occurs also in a manuscript of the prose Deguileville, the major affiliation is virtually certain. Melbourne's closest kinships within the β group are with St. John's and Laud (both published by the Chaucer Society in No. 57). The three share a number of variants (most strikingly, the peculiarities in lines 98-99, 120, and 135; see transcription); the northerly coloring to the language is also characteristic of all three. The relationship, however, is not simple but rather complex; Melbourne is hardly a copy of either of these or of any extant manuscript. The β manuscripts are looked upon by most editors as forming the superior group. The Melbourne scribe uses the following abbreviations: the common signs for er ; es/is (both occur written out; es is arbitrarily chosen); per ; pre . There are frequent flourishes which suggest abbreviations—and some conceivably may be. These markings are not recorded, however, the line being exceedingly hard to draw. 38 The scribe, who distinguishes þ from γ (see part I above), in a few instances writes þ ow where grammatically yow is expected (perhaps the exemplar did not clearly differentiate þ and y ); in these cases the expected form is inserted within square brackets. In the manuscript F is actually always ff . Each stanza begins with an illuminated initial. The italicized names (line 89, etc.) are, of course, only underlined in the manuscript. The passages from the prose Deguileville are included so that the transcription may match those given by the Chaucer Society. f. 74 v , l. 7 And þen oute of þe clowed a scriptur scho kest me . and saide me þus.

Chaucer's Truth survives in 24 manuscript copies and some six early printed editions with pretensions to manuscript authority. Robinson presents 18 of these texts as forming three groups: α, β, γ. By far the largest is the last: Caxton's edition, c. 1478; Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 203; Fairfax 16, Bodleian (2 copies); Harley 7333, British Museum; Hatton 73, Bodleian; Cambridge University Library Kk. 1.5; Lansdowne 699, British Museum; Arch. Selden B. 10 and B. 24, Bodleian. 40 The Nottingham copy, which belongs to this group, has the greatest overall similarity to Fairfax (2nd copy), which is printed by the Chaucer Society in No. 59. 41 Nottingham seems also related to Caxton (Chaucer Society, ibid.), Corpus (Chaucer Society, No. 60), and the editions of Thynne, Tottel, and Stowe (see fn. 40 above), for it shares with them the variant (probable error) Rede for Reule , line 6. 42 The omitted article in line 1 (all other texts read the before pres ) is Nottingham's only unique reading. Although editors have generally preferred the α and β readings, the γ variants may also come from Chaucer. 43 Although far from perfect, Nottingham is a better than average γ text. The problems of transcription are slight. The Scribe employs only one abbreviation, the common sign for er. F is ff in the manuscript. f. 2 v [In margin] Le bon councell de Chawcer Fle fro pres and dwelle wyth sothefastnes Suffice vnto thy goode . though it be smalle For horede hathe hate . and clymyng tykylnes Presse hath envye . and wele is blynd ouer all Sauore nomore . than the behoue shall Rede well thyself . that oþer folke kanst rede And trowthe shalle the delyuer it ys no drede Peyne the not alle croked to redresse In truste to here that turnyth as a balle Grete rest stant . in litell besynes Be ware also . to sporne ayenst a nalle Stryve not as doth a crokke wyth þe walle Daunt thesylf . that dauntyst otheres dede And trowth shall the delyuer . it is no drede That the is sent . resceyve in buxenes.

Robinson views the four authorities as forming two groups: α Fairfax 16, Bodleian; β Harley 7578, British Museum; Cotton Cleopatra D. vii, British Museum; Stowe's edition, 1561. Only the Cotton copy has been printed (Chaucer Society, No. 60). Robinson observes: "variants from the other copies are registered by Skeat (Oxf. Chau., I, pp. 409 f.) and the Globe editor. Type α [i.e. Fairfax] is superior; the C [Cotton] text has been corrected by comparison with it" (apparently means comparison with the variants from it given by Skeat and the Globe). The printed variants, however, are by no means complete. 44 Moreover, we have the anomaly of the best manuscript's not being in print. 45 The problems of transcription are slight. Except for one instance of omitted r (grace, line 2; α written above the line thus: g a ce ), the only abbreviation is the common sign for er. F is actually ff in the manuscript.

      <field name="fulltext">V We bring together below manuscripts which have been referred to as unpublished and also certain early printed editions which have never been reprinted. 46 (1) Complaynt d'Amours. The authorities for this poem (uncertainly Chaucer's; see Robinson, p. 524) are Harley 7333, British Museum (ff. 135 v -136 r ); Fairfax 16, Bodleian (ff. 197 r -198 v ); and Bodley 638, Bodleian (ff. 212 r -214 r ). Robinson says: "None of these copies has been printed exactly, but Skeat (Oxf. Chau., I, 411 ff.) gives a text based upon H[arley] and records numerous variants of F [Fairfax] and B [Bodley]" (p. 920). These manuscripts are "genuine witnesses"; they could be published elsewhere—although it is possible, while laborious and open to misinterpretation, to recover nearly all of the substantive variants if Skeat's readings are supplemented (they are far from complete) by the variants recorded in the Globe Chaucer, pp. 635-637, and by Koch, Geoffrey Chaucers Kleinere Dichtungen , pp. 72-74. 47 Some features cannot be got from the variant readings: a full picture of the spelling; the virgules (see fn. 44 above) with which Fairfax is punctuated. (2) Against Women Unconstant. The copy in Harley 7578, British Museum (ff. 17 v -18), as said above (part IV), has never been published. Editors since Skeat have apparently depended on Skeat's variants, which are of course unsatisfactory for spellings and not quite complete even for substantive variation (line 4, I haue lyue &amp; ). This text could be printed. We do not do so here, feeling there is no pressing need to have it in print as it is similar to Cotton Cleopatra (published), which is a better text in the same tradition. Robinson also lists the copy in Stowe's edition of Chaucer's Works (1561) among the authorities. This copy, which resembles Cotton also, hardly needs reprinting as Stowe's edition is not an extremely rare book. (3) A Complaint to his Lady. Robinson (p. 916) cites the copy in Stowe's edition of Chaucer's Works (1561) as one of the three authorities and notes that it "closely resembles H [Harley 78]." Although there are differences, Stowe's version hardly requires reprinting, for the reason given immediately above. (4) Adam Scriveyn. The Brown-Robbins Index of Middle English Verse includes (No. 120) among the authorities the copy in Cambridge University Library Gg. 4. 27, 1 b; Koch, in his Geoffrey Chaucers Kleinere Dichtungen , also refers to this manuscript (p. 26). This is one of the 17th-century additions to the famous manuscript; it has no textual value, being simply taken from the 1598 printed edition of Chaucer's Works; see fn. 4 above, and also Manly and Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales , 1, 178. (5) The Complaint of Chaucer to his Empty Purse. The Robbins-Cutler Supplement (1965) to the Brown-Robbins Index adds, under No. 3787, the copy in MS. Gg. 4. 27, 1 b (f. 35 r ); the comment made above under (4) applies. (6) Merciles Beaute. The Brown-Robbins Index , under No. 4284, lists the copy in Additional 38179, British Museum (II, f. 51 r ) and identifies it as "xvii century transcript by Ainsworth". Since only one manuscript of this delightful poem has been known, the existence of a second manuscript should be exciting. Alas, the second appears to be taken from the first (Pepys 2006). Like Pepys (Chaucer Society, No. 77), Additional has the inversion in line 1 ( Your two Yen ) and this (apparently for ther ) in the last line. There are differences, however, which seem worth noting (and which may mean that the source of Additional is not Pepys 2006 but Pepys 2006's source): numerous differences in spelling; a few minor substantive differences ( wille for woll , line 1; will [so also Ch. Soc.] for woll , line 4; An for Mi , line 5); better handling of final -e. Interestingly, whereas Pepys is untitled, Additional is headed Mercilese Beautee (cf. Skeat: "The title 'Mercilesse Beaute' is given in the Index to the Pepys MS"; Works , I, 548). 48 (7) Gentilesse. Eleanor P. Hammond 49 mentions a copy of the poem as being in Bossewell's Workes of Armorie (1572). This text (on ff. 13 v -14 r ) is virtually identical with the second copy of the poem in Stowe's edition of Chaucer's Works (1561), from which it is obviously taken. (8) Lak of Stedfastnesse. Caroline F. E. Spurgeon 50 mentions a copy of the envoy to this poem in Hanmer's The Auncient Ecclesiastical Histories (1577), p. 408. The source of this text is one of the Thynne editions (1532, etc.), all of which, like the Hanmer copy, omit O , line 25, and read the for thy , line 26. (9) Truth. C. Brown ( Register of Middle English Religious Verse , No. 515), 51 Brown-Robbins (Index, No. 809), and Robinson (p. 918) refer with a query to a possible copy in MS. Phillipps 11409; Mr. Nichols also mentions this possible copy (p. 46). The Phillipps collection has now been rather widely dispersed, and no one seems to know the location of this manuscript. We would note that the catalog of the Phillipps collection ( Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum in Bibliotheca Phillippica , 1837) gives a table of contents for MS. 11409 but does not mention a copy of Truth . 52 There are also three early printed copies of Truth which have never been reprinted (see fn. 40 above). That in Stowe's edition (1561; sig. O005 v -6 r ) resembles Caxton's edition (Chaucer Society, No. 59) but has "right" readings in lines 1 ( Fle ; Caxton Fle ye ), 2 ( though ; Caxton yf ), and 6 ( canst ; Caxton omits). The copies in de Worde's Prouerbes of Lydgate (c. 1515; sig. A3 v ) and Pynson's edition of Chaucer's Works (1526; The boke of fame , sig. e4 r ) are similar and closely associated with the manuscript Arch. Selden B. 10, Bodleian (Chaucer Society, No. 77). The three share identical Latin titles and the striking variants cocle for crokke , line 12, and our lorde for God , line 19, as well as other similarities. Interestingly, the manuscript here is from one of the printed copies . 53 The manuscript, as noted, has been printed; the printed editions have never been reprinted. They could be reprinted, of course, but it is hardly essential that they be. They are not of great textual value. They resemble, but are below, the Leyden Vossius 9 text published by Mr. Nichols (p. 49). (10) Fortune. The Truth in de Worde's Prouerbes of Lydgate just mentioned is preceded by, on sigs. A2 r -A3 v , a copy of Chaucer's Fortune which likewise appears to be the source of the version in the Selden B. 10 manuscript (which the Chaucer Society prints in No. 77); see fn. 53 above.</field>

Henry of Exeter University is engaged on editing the Manhood ; Mrs. E. M. Ingram of East Michigan and Mr. H. V. Zehner of Ford-ham are collaborating on the Soul , which has previously been edited twice in unpublished theses by Professor M. D. Clubb and Sister M. D. Barry, from a single copy in each case. A digest of the first translation and selections from the second were published by Katherine I. Cust as sequels to (and usually bound with) Nathaniel Hill, The Ancient Poem of G. De Guileville entitled Le Pelerinage de l'Homme compared with The Pilgrim's Progress of John Bunyan (1858). 9 A. G. Watson, The Manuscripts of Henry Savile of Banke (1969), no. 60, pp. 30, 88. 10 T. Phillipps, Catalogus Manuscriptorum Magnae Britanniae I (1850), 32, no. 459: Gras Dieu: a book so called: or a Spiritual Pilgrimage to the City of Jerusalem. This corresponds with the content and customary title of the Soul alone, but it would also cover the coupling of the two. Several of the Kingston manuscripts in fact seem to survive. 11 St. John's College, Oxford, MS. 94 and Bodleian Library, MS. Rawl. C. 258: see H. O.

Neither description is quite complete. 12 At least four of the extant manuscripts of the Soul are so called; Sir Thomas Cumberworth in 1450 left copies both of "gracedew" and "gracedew of the sowde" to his chantry priests at Somerby (Lincs.), but the latter, which survives as New York Public Library, Spencer MS. 19, bears the title Grace Dieu unqualified. See V. H. Paltsits, "The Petworth Manuscript of 'Grace Dieu' or 'The Pilgrimage of the Soul,'" Bulletin of New York Public Library , 32 (1928), 715-720. There are other bequests by this name, as well as Gracia Dei , which could also refer to an ascetical or a medical compilation. 13 R. H. Robbins &amp; J. L.

In the New York manuscript the translation is said to have been commissioned by a lady, and the poem in HM 111 was commissioned by the Countess of Hereford (d. 1419). 17 By Professor Angus McIntosh, on the evidence of his and Professor M.

Parkes, English Cursive Book Hands 1250-1500 (1969), esp. pp. xix-xx. 19 The relation of f. 96 to the rest of its quire and that preceding, and the reason for the change of hand, cannot be settled without an examination of the original, of which I have not had an opportunity, being dependent on a film very kindly supplied by the State Library. 20 Cf. Sinclair, p. 364, n. 57. 21 "xl dayes of pardon"; Bradshaw noted one prayer on behalf of a woman, perhaps for Eleanor, John Harpur's wife. The Originalia are not mentioned by Bradshaw, Report of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society (1878), xvi-iii, nor one leaf of a large notated and illuminated leaf of an antiphonal of English manufacture of the later 15th century, part of the Easter offices, which is stuck in at the end of the book. 22 Margaret Rickert's chapter in J. M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales (1940), I, 561-583, is the only systematic survey of border illumination in fifteenth-century England, but its range is restricted by the Chaucerian preoccupation. The occurrence of David and Chad in the original hand of the kalendar puts it after 1415, and Bradshaw notes an anthem ascribed to Master Richard de Caister, 1413 (d. 1420), for whom see The Book of Margery Kempe , ed. S. B. Meech &amp; H. E. Allen, 1, E.E.T.S. o. s., 212 (1940), 276, 320. 23 E. g., Edburga, Penburga, Wulburga [sic], Boniface, Kylian, Alphege, Robert, John of Beverley, John of Bridlington. 24 See Stebbing Shaw, History &amp; Antiquities of Staffordshire (1807), II, 65-68, for the descent of the estate, the relationship of the church, the people and the book, with the text of the historical narrative. The circumstances are misinterpreted by C. Brown and R. H. Robbins, Index of Middle English Verse (1943), no. 3637; somewhat differently in R. H. Robbins &amp; J. L.

H. Robbins, Historical Poems of the XIVth and XVth Centuries (New York, 1959), no. 1, pp. 3-6, 247, where the Nottingham manuscript is mistakenly noted as "olim Lyell". 31 E. P. Hammond, Chaucer: A Bibliographical Manual (New York, 1908, repr. 1933), pp. 333-5, 338-9; A. A. Brusendorff, The Chaucer Tradition (Oxford &amp; Copenhagen, 1925), pp. 182-7, 190-3. There is also a description and list of contents in A Summary Catalogue of Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian , II, ii (Oxford, 1937), 778-80, no. 3896. 32 Fairfax contains five or six; Auchinleck twelve; its contemporary Harley 2253 six (cf. N. R. Ker, Facsimile , E. E. T. S. 255, Oxford, 1964, p. xvi); Trinity College, Cambridge, R. 3. 19 and R. 3. 21 each have thirteen or more.

Geburtstag [Vienna, 1972], p. 168: "the style of the miniature suggests a date nearer 1460." 34 See f. 88v at actual size in W. W. Skeat, Twelve Facsimiles of Old English Manuscripts (Oxford, 1892), pl. X. 35 The simple unlooped secretary w , found regularly here, becomes common in London from the 1430's onwards; Sir Richard Roos, to whom the translation of Alan Chartier's La Belle Dame sans Merci is elsewhere ascribed, was then in his twenties—see Ethel Seaton, Sir Richard Roos (London, 1961), pp. 80-85. 36 The shield of Stanley quartered with Hooton (?—the bend in the latter should be vert, not azure, according to Papworth), all within a border, with a crest of a tree perhaps for Storeton, cannot be Thomas Lord Stanley's (1405-59), pace Brusendorff, Seaton, Pächt and Alexander, but more likely of William Stanley esquire, son of Sir William and Margery heiress of Sir William de Hooton; the father died about 1428 and the son in 1466; G. Ormerod, History of the County Palatine &amp; City of Chester , 2nd ed. rev. &amp; enl. T. Halsby (London, 1882), II, 410, 415-6, 448. 37 Robinson mentions only 13 texts (two copies in Pepys); the others, in addition to Melbourne, are Coventry and Cosin V. I. 9 (two stanzas only; printed by A. I. Doyle, Durham Philobiblon , I (1953), 54-55). 38 Especially when final, n is often tailed in a fashion which might be read nn or un (e.g., lesson , line 179) except that the identical letter appears in founde , line 38, and agayn , line 68. Final r often has a curl which could be read as e , as in our (several times with the curl; also spelt out oure , line 58). Despite the example just mentioned, it seems uncertain that the curl was more than a mere flourish for the scribe: euer , always with the curled r when spelt out, appears with the er abbreviation as euer not euere (lines 51, 135); while spellings like scriptur (prose) may look odd, er (are), wer (were), and wherfor (wherefore), etc. occur unambiguously without the curl (lines 23, 103, 176, 180). Finally, final d sometimes has a sign suggesting suspension (temptingly in hadd , line 94, but also in Venquysed , line 8, enlumyned , line 73, and a number of others). 39 The word bokaunce (which apparently makes no sense) seems clearly a misreading of bobaunce (supported by all the other texts). 40 Other γ MSS. (unclassified by Robinson): Additional 36983, British Museum; Cotton Otho A. XVIII (Thomas transcript), British Museum; Leyden University Library Vossius 9; Nottingham MS.; Pepys 2006, Magdalene College, Cambridge; also the printed editions of de Worde (c. 1515), Pynson (1526), Thynne (1532), Tottel (1557), and Stowe (1561), although these latter vary in their value as " genuine witnesses." 41 Nottingham shares with Fairfax 31 variants out of a possible 36—as determined by computer (figure from Professor James Peavler, Northern Illinois University, from data supplied; note that the variants are undifferentiated, include "right" readings as well as errors). 42 Other connections of Nottingham as suggested by the computer (similar undifferentiated variants): Pepys 2006 (30); Fairfax 16, 1st copy (30); Stowe (29); Caxton (28). 43 See Brusendorff, op. cit. (n. 31 above), pp. 203-204. 44 Neither Skeat nor the Globe records, for example, the striking substantive variation in lines 1-2 and in the refrain (lines 7, 14); substantive variation also in lines 8 and 12, and lesser variation in other lines. One may note that Fairfax is the only copy with the virgules (not recorded by Skeat, Globe); on the possible metrical significance of these markings in some Chaucer MSS. see Ian Robinson, Chaucer's Prosody (1971), ch. 7. 45 Cf. John Koch, explaining his choice of basic text: "nur erstere [Cotton] vollständig von Furnivall abgedruckt, daher als Grundlage benutzt" ( Geoffrey Chaucers Kleinere Dichtungen , Heidelberg, 1928, p. 25). 46 The writer has in his possession either photographs or transcriptions of all the copies mentioned. 47 One might add to these: line 24, dispende Bodley; line 26, mercy and Bodley; line 30, omit but Bodley; lines 39, 48 Hit Fairfax, Bodley (Harley It ); line 62, lawhe Harley, lawgh Fairfax, Bodley; line 75 shulde Harley, shul Fairfax, shall Bodley; line 90, wolde Harley, wol Fairfax, wull Bodley. 48 The Additional copy has been gone over by Urry, the editor of the 1721 edition of Chaucer's Works , who supplies the second-from-last stanza (omitted by Ainsworth); the poem does not appear in Urry's edition—perhaps because Urry died before the work was in final shape. 49 Op. cit. (see n. 31), p. 371. 50 Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion (1925), I, 112-113. 51 Oxford, 1920. 52 Furnivall's statement (Chau. Soc., No. 58, p. 407) is probably responsible for all of the subsequent references to this uncertain MS: "Besides the above, there are late paper copies in the Bedford Library MS., and the Phillipps ( Cheltenham ) 11409 ." The first part of Furnivall's statement is true (see MLN , 63, 458-459, for Bedford copy), but this is hardly guarantee that the second is. According to Philip Robinson (Dr. Doyle writes), the only record of the Phillipps MSS. which are still in the hands of the Robinson Trust does not contain a 11409 (the record however may be incomplete; "large quantities" remain unexamined); Dr. A. N. L. Munby has no record of the sale of a Phillipps 11409. "Ghost" MSS. are particularly troublesome. If anyone has information about Phillipps 11409 we would be grateful for a communication. 53 In addition to the similarities mentioned the MS. has at the end the colophon: Empryntede at london in fletestret at the sygne of the sonne by Wynkyn Worde (this has been remarked upon before; cf. Hammond, p. 341). On the lack of contemporary differentiation between 15th-century MSS. and early printed editions see Curt F. Bühler, The Fifteenth Century Book (1960), pp. 16-17.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Hunnis and the 1577 Paradise of Dainty Devices by Steven W. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Professor Hyder Rollins based his edition of The Paradise of Dainty Devices , the most popular Elizabethan anthology of poetry, upon nine of its ten known editions printed between 1576 and 1606. Rollins decided that all references to the lost 1577 edition of the Paradise could probably be traced to the copy described by William Herbert in his revision of Ames's Typographical Antiquities . From Herbert's testimony, Rollins concluded "beyond reasonable doubt that the 1577 and 1578 editions were identical, or, more accurately, that B [1578], was simply a reprint of X [1577]." 1 I intend to show, however, that the 1577 edition was by no means merely reprinted in 1578, but that it comprises an independent stage in the anthology's evolution, as do the editions of 1578, 1580, and 1585. Twelve new texts were introduced in 1577, more than in any later edition. Among them is William Hunnis' long-sought elegy for his first patron, William, First Earl of Pembroke, a poem which appeared only in this second edition of the anthology. The signatures to sixteen poems were changed, more than in all succeeding editions combined, while scores of textual variants were transmitted from the 1577 Paradise to the later editions. Moreover, the authority of many variant readings as well as changes in authorship can be established, since it is now possible to demonstrate that William Hunnis was personally concerned with the make-up and printing of the 1577 edition. My reconstruction is based on a transcript of the entire book in William Herbert's autograph, now Bodleian MS. Douce e.16. 2 This manuscript is a vellum bound quarto volume of eleven gatherings, each made up of from sixteen to eighteen leaves. It now contains 162 folios and three flyleaves, of which ff. ii and iii are of thin tracing paper, unlike the rest of the codex. Five leaves have been cut out from the eighth gathering between present ff. 117 and 118. The leaves are of eighteenth-century stock and measure 161 x 201 mm. 3 Herbert's text of the 1577 Paradise occupies ff. 1 r , 3 r-v , and the rectos only of ff. 4-115, a transcript of twenty-one to thirty-two lines per full page. On ff. 116 r and 117 r , George Steevens wrote out some notes and the text of a poem which first appeared in the 1580 Paradise . The commentary on this material in Herbert's handwriting on f. 117 r shows, however, that the manuscript was still in his possession at the time of Steevens' entry. Its second definite owner was Francis Douce, who stamped his monogram seal on ff. 1, 1 v , 88 v , 118 v , and on f. 118 r below his transcription of a poem ascribed to Robert, Earl of Essex. 4 On f. i v Douce listed eight editions of the anthology and the whereabouts of copies known to him, while in the Paradise text itself he jotted down a few scattered notes in pencil. Beyond this, neither he nor Steevens seems to have tampered with Herbert's transcript, nor is it likely that they could have done so with authority. The only known copy of the 1577 edition was owned by Sir John Hawkins, as Herbert acknowledges in the Typographical Antiquities , 5 and it seems very probable that this unique copy perished in the fire which destroyed Hawkins' house in Westminster in 1785. 6 Since then, Herbert's transcript has survived as the only witness to the complete text of the 1577 Paradise . Herbert probably copied the Hawkins text about 1777, to judge from his dated signature on f. i, "W m Herbert. 1777." He incorporated some of his notes from the inside front cover of the manuscript almost verbatim into his description of the Paradise in the Typographical Antiquities (II, 685), where he treats the 1577 edition as if it were the only one. But on the inside front cover of the manuscript he noted a letter of July 14, 1788, from "G. S." (George Steevens), informing him of six editions of the Paradise , including the first of 1576. Herbert added this material, with acknowledgments to Steevens, and again almost verbatim, to the "Corrections and Additions" in Vol. III of the Antiquities (1790), 1792. Apparently, then, this manuscript served Herbert as a working notebook of materials related to the Paradise , all centered of course on his transcript of the 1577 edition. By 1814 at the latest Francis Douce had acquired the manuscript, for in that year William Beloe acknowledges, in describing the 1577 Paradise , that "Mr. Douce possesses a Transcript by the late Mr. Herbert . . . with the use of which he has obligingly accommodated me." Moreover, Beloe's list of the various editions of the Paradise and owners of individual copies clearly shows that he followed Douce MS. e.16, for he reproduces almost exactly the list which Douce had added to Herbert's notes on f. i v . 7 Douce willed his main collection of manuscripts to the Bodleian Library at his death, but reserved a number of papers, including this manuscript, to the custody of the British Museum, with instructions that they not be examined before 1900. In 1933 the British Museum transferred these materials to the Bodleian, where the Herbert/Douce manuscript became MS. Douce e.16. Just how accurately Herbert copied the 1577 Paradise may be estimated beyond his reputation as a careful bibliographer, for about 1780 he undertook the far more difficult task of copying the three volumes of the Stationers' Registers. Franklin Dickey has compared this transcript with the originals and concludes that, while Herbert sometimes "transposes or omits whole entries . . . whatever he does record he sets down with considerable though not absolute accuracy, his infrequent slips being caused by ignorance or by misreading." 8 Now, the spacing of folio rectos and versos at regular intervals in the Paradise transcript shows that Herbert could not have omitted any substantial portion of the book, and he presumably would have copied this print with fewer misreadings than he did the sixteenth-century hands of the Registers. Furthermore, the Douce e.16 text itself proves that Herbert took pains to copy both accidental and substantive readings exactly. A number of the transcript's most obvious errors, for example, also occur in either the 1576 or 1578 prints, or in both, 9 indicating that Herbert preserved these faults as they had been reprinted in the second edition, or were reprinted from it in the third. Herbert's frequent correction of accidentals which could have no textual importance also shows that he regularly checked his work against the print to be sure that he had copied even minor details correctly. 10 This is not to say, of course, that his work is without error; certainly the phrases omitted at 41.21, 52.13, and 88.31, all of which appear fully in the 1576 and 1578 editions, suggest scribal lapses. On the other hand, the 1577 Paradise undoubtedly printed unique errors of its own, and I do not claim that any of these mistakes are necessarily Herbert's. Rather, his duplication of misprints, and the very minor corrections which he added to his work argue that this is a meticulously prepared transcript from which the 1577 Paradise can be reconstructed with a high degree of reliability. Herbert's is a continuous rather than page-by-page transcript, and it does not record the signatures, catchwords, running-heads, or pagination, if any, of the original. Presumably, the 1577 edition was printed in black letter, as were the other three editions, 1576, 1578, and 1580, by Henry Disle, the original printer of the Paradise . If so, Herbert's use of a broken underline in his transcript must represent italics, for corresponding passages in these other editions appear in italic type. By the same token, Herbert's solid underline seems to indicate roman type, while solid and broken underlining together represent capital roman or italic letters. The stanzas of each poem are numbered with arabic numerals in the transcript, although this is probably Herbert's addition, since the numerals are found in no other edition and appear in a red pencil or crayon rather than in the ink of the rest of the manuscript. Herbert records the indentation of lines and layout of stanzas on the page, as well as foliation. 11 A new leaf is indicated, usually in the left margin, with "Fo." and an arabic numeral, and is followed in the transcript with "b" to mark the verso. Working from this foliation and Herbert's statement that the 1577 Paradise was a quarto, we can reconstruct its probable format. The title page (f. 1 of the manuscript) was probably signed A1, 12 and was no doubt ornamented, as were Disle's other editions of the anthology, with his oval seal, as traced on f. iii: [underlined with a broken rule under which is a straight rule] The Paradyse | [underlined with a broken rule] of daynty deuiſes. | Conteyning ſundry pithy precepts, learned | [no underlining] counſels, and excellent inuentions, right pleaſant | and profitable for all eſtates. | [underlined with a broken rule] Deuiſed and written for the most part, by M.

The dedicatory letter following the title page on f. 3 of the manuscript must have occupied signature A2 r , while A2 v is indicated by the "b" to the left of Disle's heading for the errata list which precedes the poetry in this edition. The first poem, Rollins' No. 1, apparently began at the top of A3 r , which is the first folio recorded by Herbert. Although no "Fo. 1" occurs in the transcript, a "b" in the left margin at line 35 of poem No. 1 marks the verso of a third leaf, and is followed thirty-five lines below with "Fo. 2", which apparently designates A4 r . Hereafter, new leaves and their versos are noted at regular intervals of thirty-three to thirty-five lines to a total of forty-six leaves. 13 Counting the first leaf, with the title page and Compton arms, and the second, with the dedicatory letter and errata list, the 1577 edition was composed of forty-eight leaves, which neatly conforms to the requirements of a quarto of twelve gatherings, probably signed A-M. Both the first and second editions of the Paradise contained ninety-nine poems (I count Nos. 23/101 and 72/109 as one each throughout this analysis), but twelve poems from the 1576 collection were replaced by twelve new ones in 1577. 14 The 1578 Paradise differs from both its predecessors by omitting No. 38, and while Rollins conjectured that No. 110 almost certainly appeared first in 1577, this poem is in fact unique to the 1578 Paradise . Thus only eleven of the twelve poems introduced in the second edition reappeared in the third, for the following elegy by William Hunnis is in turn unique to the edition of 1577: Fo. 17 33. Vpon the life and death of the noble Earle of Penbrooke . Let such as striue, for honors prayse, with palme to bere the sway: Pursue the pathes that Penbrooke , past, to honors redy way.

The courters all, bewaile his want, and with one voyce Can say: The comeliest courtier in the courte, by death is tane away. FINIS. W. Hunnis . [ff. 42-43] In her biography of Hunnis, Mrs. Stopes theorized that he must have written something to commemorate the death of his patron, William Herbert, First Earl of Pembroke of the second creation, who died March 17, 1569/70. 15 While no other copy of Hunnis' elegy seems to have survived, it might well have been registered among the six elegies for Pembroke in the Stationers' Register, 16 for it is highly improbable that Hunnis waited until seven years after Pembroke's death to publish it. Had it been licensed and published ca. 1570 this might account for its occurrence in only the 1577 Paradise , and for some part of the twenty shilling fine levied against Disle by the Stationers' Company on June 20, 1577, "for printinge a booke vnlaufullie and the booke vnallowed." 17 Rollins suggested that Disle might have incurred this fine for publishing the 1577 edition itself (p. xli), since it had not been registered. The normal fine for printing an unlicensed book at this time, however, was about five shillings, and only ten shillings for printing one against the ordinances of the Stationers' Company. 18 Possibly, Disle's fine was augmented because he published an unlicensed, unregistered book, and within it, Hunnis' elegy on Pembroke which belonged to another printer. Whether or not this explains Disle's abnormally large fine, and the omission of this poem from subsequent editions of the Paradise , the appearance of Hunnis' long-sought elegy here is one of the most unexpected features of the 1577 edition, and one which distinguishes it from all others. Beyond these changes in content, the second edition differs substantially from the first with regard to the authorship of its poems. This is reflected on the verso of the 1577 title page in the list of contributors printed beneath the Compton arms: Saint Barnard. Iasper Heywod. E. O. F. Kindlemarsh. Lord Vaux the elder D. Sand W. Hunis. M. Yloop. Two names from the 1576 title page, "M. Bevve", and "R. Hill", are omitted here, while the "D. S." and "F. K." of the first edition are expanded, and "W. Hunis" is added. Within the anthology, moreover, sixteen of the eighty-seven poems which occur in both the first and second editions receive new or altered ascriptions in 1577. These changes all survive in the edition of 1578, which seems to have been set up for the most part from a lightly corrected copy of the second edition. Despite the claims of its title pages, "the most part" of the Paradise poems were never assigned to Richard Edwards, although his ascriptions do increase from ten in 1576 to seventeen in 1577, plus the couplet added to Hunnis' poem 72/109. The second edition decreases the number of attributions to Lord Vaux from thirteen to eleven, deletes two poems by "M. B." (Nos. 49 and 58), and transfers Bewe's remaining works (Nos. 67, 73, and 82) to Hunnis, Edwards, and Oxford respectively; thus, Bewe is eliminated from both the text and title page. But the most significant changes in authorship concern the number of poems assigned to William Hunnis, from only seven in 1576 to eighteen in 1577, so that Hunnis becomes the largest single contributor to the Paradise . He nevertheless loses two poems in 1577 which were attributed to him in the first edition: No. 61 (actually by Sir Thomas Wyatt) and No. 70, both of which are also omitted from all later editions of the anthology. These losses are more than offset, however, by assigning to Hunnis six poems which were either anonymous or assigned to others in the first edition (Nos. 5, 48, 64, 67, 88, and 94), and by crediting him with seven of the twelve new poems introduced in 1577 (his elegy for Pembroke plus Nos. 105-108, 111, and 112). Still, a thorough understanding of Hunnis' part in this edition emerges only after studying the variant readings of the 1576 and 1577 texts. In the following chart, the eleven poems from the first edition which were assigned to Hunnis in the second 19 are compared on the basis of errors corrected, new errors, and other substantive changes, with the total number of words involved in each change shown in parentheses. The same analysis is provided for similar amounts of verse by Edwards, Vaux, Kinwelmarsh, and a group of the remaining poems selected at random. Textual Variants Between the 1576 and 1577 Editions Poet Errors Corrected New Errors Other Substantive Changes Edwards 7 (10) 7 (7) 9 (10) Kinwelmarsh 4 (4) 7 (9) 4 (8) Vaux 4 (4) 6 (9) --- Random Group 5 (5) 12 (14) 5 (8) Hunnis 11 (11) 5 (5) 28 (43) This analysis deals with forty-five of the eighty-seven poems common to both the 1576 and 1577 editions, and reveals that a significantly greater number of substantive changes were made in the poems assigned to Hunnis than in those of any other poet or poets in the anthology. Moreover, few of the "Other Substantive Changes" in Hunnis' works are really preferable to the former readings, even though they include several wholly recast lines. These corrections tend mainly to heighten alliteration or to regularize and even over-regularize the meter; they are accordingly of the very kind that Hunnis, a representative poet of the 1570's, would have made in his own work. Despite this concentrated revision of his work, a study of all eighteen poems assigned to Hunnis in 1577 reveals that errors crept into his texts at about the same rate as for other poets in the volume. But this, far from indicating that Hunnis was not directly concerned with the second edition, brings us to the most dramatic evidence of his personal involvement with it, the errata list. 20 Such a precaution Errata List The Printer to the Reader. | Gentle Reader, through negligence of the woorkeman, there are certayn faultes escaped, which because I would geue no occasion of offence to the Aucthours of the ditties (who for the most part are vnknowen to me) I thought good to note them, whereby thy curious eye happening vppon them, they may with more ease be corrected.

Beyond this inconvenience, the errata list does not improve the Paradise texts in general. Disle's justification for it, that he "would geue no occasion of offence to the Aucthours of the ditties (who for the most part are vnknowen to me)" is misleading, for the ten corrections apply to eight poems all assigned to one author, William Hunnis. 21 Now, it is inconceivable that the printer would have voluntarily troubled himself with an errata list just for Hunnis after already changing more than three times as many readings in his poems as for any other contributor. Rather, Hunnis must have personally read the sheets and demanded certain corrections before the entire edition had been printed. The seventh correction in the list, a substitution of "vow" for "moue" at 67.16, was apparently made before all the sheets were printed, for this correction occurs in Herbert's transcript. The others, none of which are recorded in the chart above, correct six errors in Hunnis' poems and add four more substantive changes, involving a total of twenty words. This extraordinary attention to Hunnis' poems, the addition of his name to the title page and to six poems not attributed to him in the first edition, besides the fact that he contributed seven of the twelve new poems in the second edition, all argue strongly for his personal involvement with the printing. Hunnis' works here constitute, I believe, an "edition" which was revised, proofread, and corrected by the author. Mrs. Stopes noticed that in editions of the Paradise after the first, "the greatest number of variations occur in the poems attributed to William Hunnis"; 22 but contrary to what she implies, there is no evidence that Hunnis was directly concerned with any but the 1577 Paradise . The surprising number of variants she found in the later editions resulted from the ever more corrupted reprintings of the changes he made in the second edition. Nor does the evidence from the 1577 Paradise support the idea that Hunnis helped to make ends meet by acting as Richard Edwards' literary executor. 23 The two men were no doubt closely associated as members of the Chapel Royal between Hunnis' admission ca.1550-1553, 24 and Edwards' death in 1566. And some literary connection between them may be inferred from the addition in 1577 of two lines by Edwards to Hunnis' poem No. 72/109. Yet Hunnis clearly did not supply Disle with Edwards' manuscript in the first place, nor did he work with him on the edition of 1576, where his contributions are obscured by faulty texts and signatures. Instead, Hunnis must have been appalled at finding himself so misrepresented, and in the second edition he diligently corrected and enhanced his part in the anthology. This attention to the 1577 Paradise is but one of several projects Hunnis undertook between 1575 and 1581 in what was for him an unprecedented burst of literary output. In 1575 he contributed to the famous Kenilworth Entertainment, while his Hyue Full of Hunnye was entered in the Stationers' Register in 1577, his Handful of Honisuckles in 1578, and his Seuen Sobs of a Sorrowful Soule in 1581. This activity must somehow be linked with his replacement as Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal by Richard Farrant from at least 1576 until Farrant's death on November 30, 1580. Hunnis' sudden interest in seeing his works published during these years argues against Chambers' theory that he remained in fact Master of the Children, while Farrant merely served him as a deputy. 25 The flood of publications quickly receded after Hunnis was restored to the Mastership; indeed, he brought out only one more book between 1582 and his death in 1597, the Hunnies Recreations of 1588. Between 1576 and 1580, he may have kept his place as a Gentleman of the Chapel, and he probably supported himself in part as a grocer and as Supervisor of the Gardens at Greenwich. 26 Yet leisure, necessity, or both caused him to publish frequently and to seek a patron, neither of which he had attempted to do, so far as is known, since the Earl of Pembroke's death in 1570. The publication of Hunnis' elegy on Pembroke may constitute a bid for patronage from the earl's son, Henry, Second Earl of Pembroke, who figures prominently toward the end of the poem. The Handfull of Honisuckles was dedicated to the Ladies of the Privy Chamber, and the Seuen Sobs to Frances Radcliffe, Lady Sussex; for the most part, however, Hunnis sought the attention of the Earl of Leicester, who perhaps commissioned Hunnis' part in the Kenilworth extravaganza. His next tribute to Leicester may be represented by Folger MS. X.d.459 (12), Hunnis' holograph letter dedicating to "My Lo." a book by another, unnamed author, which deals with "the p re seruation of the health of a noble creature, a Horse." As Master of the Queen's Horse since 1559, Leicester would have been a likely recipient of such a work, and indeed the anonymous Remedies for Diseases in Horses (STC 20870) was dedicated to him by the bookseller in 1576. Hunnis, then, may have presented Leicester with his letter and a copy of the book, though his right to appropriate the volume for such use remains obscure. At any rate, Hunnis was securely in Leicester's favor by 1578, for his Hyue Full of Hunnye appeared in that year with his patron's arms on the verso of the title page, and its dedicatory verses thank Leicester for his generosity. This patronage is also confirmed by the fact that Hunnis' son, Robert, was in Leicester's service from at least 1579 until 1586, and Leicester described Hunnis in a letter of September 19, 1581, as "my frend . . . that I wish right well vnto." 27 Hunnis' concern with the 1577 Paradise , then, was part of an overall effort between 1575 and 1581 to increase his reputation as a man of letters, and to establish himself as the protégé of another powerful nobleman. That he found it worthwhile to obtain a prominent place in the second edition of the Paradise provides one further measure of the anthology's contemporary importance and esteem. The textual significance of the 1577 Paradise differs from that of all other editions as a result of Hunnis' part in its composition. Although most of the second edition was apparently set up from a corrected copy of the first, it is clear that Hunnis' 1577 texts are more authoritative than those which had appeared in 1576. It is just possible, too, that Richard Edwards' verse is more reliably set forth in 1577 than in 1576, for the second edition gives him six new ascriptions plus a relatively high number of corrections and new readings. Perhaps Hunnis paid some attention to Edwards' works as well as his own while supervising the 1577 Paradise . For the remaining works common to the first two editions, we might reasonably transfer to the 1577 text Professor Rollins' judgment on that of 1578: "it makes many more or less authoritative changes in the readings of A [1576]" (p. xx). Many of the 1578 readings do correct those of both 1576 and 1577, yet agreement in error suggests that the third edition was printed from a lightly corrected copy of the second; it thus has no independent authority, and it adds many new errors of its own. Indeed, of the ten corrections in the 1577 errata list, only three (106.22, 106.26, and 112.4) found their way into the 1578 text. Except for the works of Hunnis, and perhaps Edwards, it seems that the most reliable texts in the first three editions of the Paradise are those of the earliest edition in which each work appears. Herbert's transcript, to summarize, provides us with the most significantly altered of any of the last nine editions of the Paradise with regard to overall content, attributions, and textual authority. Of the twelve poems introduced in the second edition, only Hunnis' elegy for Pembroke disappeared from the later editions. The next three editions (1578, 1580, and 1585) added another fifteen poems to the anthology, only ten of which appeared after 1585. Thus the 1577 Paradise added more new and continuously reprinted poems than did any later edition or editions. Nor do we find wholesale changes in attributions after 1577: by 1600 only three signatures were altered (Nos. 4, 57, and 88), as compared with sixteen in the second edition. Finally, for all eighteen poems by Hunnis, for seven new works by other authors, and possibly for Edwards' sixteen poems carried over from the first edition, Herbert's transcript of the 1577 Paradise provides the most authoritative texts. From MS. Douce e.16 there emerges, then, a distinctly important version of this anthology; its reconstruction brings to light a missing poem by William Hunnis and reveals his considerable influence on the 1577 Paradise , and through it, on all subsequent editions. The collations below follow the text as well as page and line numbering of Professor Rollins' edition, but I include only substantive readings and do not list all the types of variants recorded in Rollins' collations. Differences in the layout of poems on the page or information which may be gathered above, such as the numbering of the poems and most of the changes in authorship, are all omitted.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 (Cambridge, Mass., 1927), p. xvii. My references to poem, page, and line numbers in the Paradise follow this edition throughout. 2 The hand of this transcript matches Herbert's notes in MS. Douce 265, ff. 1-1v, and less closely, his letter on f. 411 of MS. Montague d.7. My identifications of handwriting by Francis Douce and George Steevens in MS. Douce e.16 rest upon comparison with holograph letters by Douce in Harvard MS. Eng. 1177, Nos. 129 and 130, and by Steevens in Harvard MS. TS 940.6, Vol. I, facing p. 38. I am grateful to Dr. D. M. Rogers and Dr. A. C. de la Mare of the Bodleian Library for supplying useful information about the format and provenance of the manuscript, and to the Bodleian Library's Keeper of Western Manuscripts for permission to print the collations. 3 The watermark resembles No. 3148, datable to 1745 in Edward Heawood's Watermarks (1950), p. 134, and Nos. 84, 95, and 98 (1746-1808) in W. A. Churchill's Watermarks in Paper in Holland, England, France (1935), p. 69. 4 No record of Douce's acquisition of the manuscript occurs in either his "Diary of Antiquarian Purchases, 1803-1834" (typescript catalogue, Bodleian Library), or in his holograph notebook of books given him between 1797 and 1814 (MS. Douce e.69), nor does it seem to be mentioned in his list of books sent to be bound, 1797-1801 (MS. Douce e.71). He may have obtained the volume privately before or shortly after Herbert's death in 1795, for it is not mentioned in either catalogue of the sales of Herbert's library: A Catalogue of Part of the Library of the Late Mr. Herbert (1796); A Catalogue of a Choice and Valuable Library . . . To Which is Added the Genuine and Very Curious Collection of Manuscripts of That Eminent Antiquary, the Late Mr. William Herbert (1798). 5 II (1786), 685. 6 Percy A. Scholes, The Life and Activities of Sir John Hawkins (1953), p. 157. Hawkins cites only the 1577 Paradise in his General History of the Science and Practice of Music (1776), III, 417; V, 481. 7 Anecdcotes of Literature and Scarce Books , I (1814), 248. Beloe changes the substance of this list only by noting that Steevens' copies of the 1596 and 1600 editions had passed to the Duke of Roxburgh's collection. 8 "The Old Man at Work: Forgeries in the Stationers' Registers," SQ , 11 (1960), 42. 9 E.g., errors in common with the edition of 1576 include "wrough" for wrought (11.8), "stauche" for stanche (49.24), and "emong" for among (58.22); the transcript and the 1578 edition agree in error with "pagnes" for pangs (38.20) and "Edimions" for Endimions (83.5). The transcript agrees with both the 1576 and 1578 texts in the corrupt first line of poem No. 84, "I am not as seem to be". 10 E.g., Herbert corrects "aduance" to "aduaunce" (36.22), "here" to "heere" (40. 26), "see" to "se" (73.25), and "sugerd" to "sugred" (90.7). 11 The references to numbered leaves in this edition's errata list suggest that it was correctly foliated by the printer, as is the transcript; but none of Disle's other editions are consistently paged or foliated, and the b 's marking versos in the MS are almost certainly Herbert's additions. 12 The first four leaves of the 1576 edition were signed with italic A 1-4, and followed by black-letter A-L4. In Disle's extant editions after the first, the signatures are continuous alphabetically, A-M, as I assume they were in 1577. In the Typographical Antiquities (III, 1792), Herbert ignored the title page and following leaf (as he did in foliating his transcript) and described the 1577 Paradise as composed of forty-six leaves. 13 Folios 35 and 37 on ff. 87 and 91 of the MS are indicated in the right margins owing to speaker prefixes which occupy the left margins. 14 Nos. 36, 49, 58, 61, 68, 70, 76, 78, 80, 86, 92 and 97 in the first edition were omitted in 1577. In 1577 the poems were arranged in the order 1, 5, 100, 3, 48, 2, 6-11, 4, 12-22, 23/101, 24-27, 102, 28-29, 103, the unique text by Hunnis, 30-35, 104, 37-38, 40-43, 45, 44, 46-47, 105, 50-57, 106, 59-60, 62-65, 75, 66-67, 69, 107-108, 71, 72/109, 73-74, 77, 79, 81-85, 111-112, 87-91, 113, 93-96, 39, 98-99. The edition of 1578 orders the poems in the same way except No. 56 precedes Nos. 111-112. Nos. 1, 75, and 71 were unnumbered in the second edition; beginning with No. 5 the poems were numbered 1-44, 46-48, 47, 49-53, 58-99. 15 C. C. Stopes, "William Hunnis and the Revels of the Chapel Royal," in Materialien zur Kunde des älteren Englischen Dramas , 29 (1910), 219. 16 Unless Hunnis' name was transformed into the Master "Hewson", whose elegy on Pembroke was licensed to Henry Bynneman, the only entry among the six which could be his is that registered by Richard Jones (Arber, I, 412). Pembroke's other identifiable elegists were David Rowland, George Coryat (see Stopes, p. 310), and at least two contributors to the Paradise besides Hunnis, Richard Edwards and Thomas Churchyard. A third possibility is Lodowick Lloyd, author of Paradise poem No. 103, for the elegy on Pembroke in Inner Temple MS. Petyt 538.10, ff. 1-1v, was apparently copied from print and is signed "L. Ll." No elegy by someone with these initials occurs in the Stationers' Registers, however, so this too could be the work licensed to Jones. 17 Arber, II, 843. 18 Ibid. , 843-850. 19 These are Nos. 5, 48, 59, 60, 63, 64, 67, 73, 88, and 94. 20 The list appears after 4.23; bracketed references in the left margin locate each correction in Rollins' edition. 21 Nos. 48, 59, 60, 63, 105, 106, 111, and 112. The first four appeared in the edition of 1576, while the rest were new in 1577. Herbert recorded the first six corrections and the ninth one marginally; he did not mark the seventh or eighth, which are ambiguous, and he apparently overlooked the tenth. 22 Stopes, p. 187. Poem No. 4 was assigned to "E. S." in 1576, to "W. R." in 1577-1580, but to Hunnis in the edition of 1585. The text, however, lacks the spate of variant readings between the first two editions which characterizes the other poems attributed to Hunnis, and it seems doubtful that he would have overlooked a single poem of his own in the collection. Similarly, two poems assigned to Hunnis in 1576, Nos. 61 and 70, were no doubt omitted from the 1577 and subsequent editions at Hunnis' request because they were not his. 23 Jackson I.

      <field name="heading_text">Compositors D and F of the Shakespeare First Folio by John O'Connor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any analysis of the transmission of a Renaissance text from manuscript to printed book must include the role of the printing-house compositor, the man who sets the play in type. The potential significance of his job is overwhelming; his skill and conscientiousness greatly influence the difference between the manuscript copy and the printed text. But before the nature and degree of his influence can be evaluated, the compositor's share of the text must be identified through a systematic analysis of the physical traits of the text. The process of evaluation is the more significant part of compositorial analysis, but the process of identification must precede it. A detailed knowledge of compositors' habits will have an immediate and significant effect on editions of Shakespeare in the treatment of accidentals (spelling, punctuation, capitalization, italics, and word-division), in lineation of verse or prose, and in the selection of emendations. This new information will also increase our understanding of the passage of copy into print. As we strip away the veneer of compositorial features, the characteristics of the no-longer-extant copy begin to appear. Thus, compositorial analysis not only can tell a bibliographer and editor what happened to the copy in the printing house, but also a little about the copy itself. 1 Any study of compositors is cumulative: it builds upon previous research, and hopes that its addition is a solid foundation for future work. The early research in compositorial analysis of the Shakespeare First Folio is well known, and is briefly summarized by Charlton Hinman in his Preface to the Norton Facsimile of the First Folio of Shakespeare . 2 Since then scholars who have attempted to identify and evaluate individual Folio compositors have achieved only mixed results. Monographs have been published on Compositors B and C, but neither has proved definitive. 3 During the past two years scholars have become especially interested in Compositors C and D, because they appeared to be more important than originally thought. However, although a major break-through has been made in establishing certain characteristics of Compositor C, his share in the Folio is still subject to some dispute; as for Compositors D and the newly discovered F 4 , their roles in the printing of the Comedies have not been adequately defined nor have the characteristics been established by which they may be accurately identified. Both men are minor compositors and worked only on the Comedies; nonetheless, in the process of identifying their shares I have assigned some pages to Compositors B and C that were previously thought to have been set by Compositors D and F, and I have developed criteria that can be used with the other compositors. Compared to the other Folio compositors, D and F are unknowns. They are shadowy figures, easily confused with Compositors A and C, and remarkably similar to each other in their compositorial habits. Not only do they spell doe | goe | here the same, but also most of the other words used to isolate Compositors A and C, like cosin, divell, griefe, indeede, mistris , and yong . Besides their superficial spelling similarities, two other circumstances make it difficult to separate Compositors D and F. First, they are minor compositors and therefore the amount of evidence from which standards can be established is slight. Often a distinctive spelling preference of Compositor D's does not appear on pages that might belong to Compositor F, and is therefore of little use in distinguishing who set those pages. The problem of limited evidence is intensified when we discover that Compositor F, unlike the other five compositors, never set a play from Quarto copy. Thus, for Compositor F, we are unable to develop any qualitative evidence; that is, a list of changes he made from extant copy which clearly reveals his preferences. Instead we must rely upon spelling counts and other mass statistical data (quantitative evidence) 5 in order to describe Compositor F's preferences. As for Compositor D, although he did set portions of four Folio plays that used extant Quartos for copy ( Ado, LLL, MND , and MV ), he accepted the copy spellings so frequently that it is difficult to describe exactly what were his spelling preferences. For example, he changed copy adieu to adue four times (twice in long lines), but he also retained copy spellings adiew (2) and adew (in a long line), and changed adiew to adew once. Nevertheless, the information that the collation of Quartos and Folio provides will be crucial evidence later, and will demonstrate the value of qualitative over quantitative evidence. The second difficulty in separating Compositors D and F is that they worked together on only one play, and even then in different quires (quires F and G in MM ). Thus evidence, such as speech prefixes, which is unique to each play is of little value in distinguishing Compositor D from Compositor F. Case evidence is also of limited use, since Compositors D and F could set type from the same case at different times. In the one play on which they both worked, Hinman was unable to make sense of the type recurrence and could not identify the cases (quires F-H). 6 However, special evidence may prove invaluable in distinguishing these two compositors from the other workmen. For example, Compositor D prefers to italicize Jew in MV , and though this feature is of no use in separating him from Compositor F, who works in other plays, it very neatly distinguishes Compositor D from Compositors B and C, who prefer to set Jew in roman. A more promising kind of evidence is psychomechanical, 7 such as has been developed to distinguish Folio compositors by the spacing of stage directions. It is more promising because it extends beyond the individual play, and is less affected by non-compositorial influences, like lack of space. Yet as with their spelling preferences, Compositors D and F are strikingly similar in their habits: both men use a similar form for their catchwords and stage directions. On the other hand, they do differ in their treatment of a verse line that is too long for their measure, and in their punctuation habits. Before examining this evidence in detail, I shall consider articles by two men who have recently written on Compositors D and F. Dr. Andrew Cairncross, in two brief articles, attempted to identify the work of the Folio compositors through spelling and psychomechanical evidence. 8 Most of the habits which Cairncross identifies are common to two or more compositors; however, he attempts to present at least one unique habit for each workman. Compositor D, according to Cairncross, is "distinguished specially by his consistent weele forms; by his ie or aie endings, as in eie, saie, betraie, onelie ; and by the dropping of final l , as in cal, fal, wil " (p. 44). The only distinctive features Cairncross lists for Compositor F are his general preference for shorter speech prefixes, and his preference for only the speech prefix (and not the prefix plus the first word of the speech) as a catchword. Compositor F, he states, elides the future tense like Compositor C ( we'll ), and his spelling preferences, doe, goe , and here , are the same as Compositor D's. Although Cairncross isolates some significant features in the work of Compositors D and F, he is not sufficiently rigorous in his examination of all the evidence. He frequently misses important counter-examples to a 'habit' which he has identified and used as evidence. One habit of Compositor C's noticed by Cairncross is actually a spacing convention common to almost all of the Folio compositors. He asserts that Compositor C indents the initial speech prefix of the play, but the initial speech prefix is indented for every play in the Folio, except three where the prefix is missing. 9 One may notice the variable amount of indentation in the following two examples: What is important, and what Cairncross fails to realize, is that each compositor differs from the others in the amount of indentation he prefers. SPACING OF THE INITIAL SPEECH PREFIX Play Page Space (inches) Compositor Tmp A1 20/32 * B TGV B4 v 25/32 F Wiv D2 16/32 C MM F1 13/32 * C Err H1 16/32 C Ado I3 1&amp;14/32 B LLL L1 v 16/32 C MND N1 1&amp;10/32 B MV 04 1&amp;14/32 B AYL Q3 18/32 C Shr S2 v 1&amp;18/32 B AWW V1 v 1&amp;10/32 B TN Y2 24/32 B? WT Aal 8/32 A KJ al 15/32 C A clear pattern emerges: Compositor B centers the initial prefix, Compositor C indents approximately ½", and Compositor F indents approximately 3/4". The difference between Compositor C and Compositor F is slight but will be crucial evidence later when when I reject Cairncross' use of catchwords as a standard for separating Compositors D and F. Similarly, his criteria for distinguishing Compositor D need to be sharpened. He examines the changes Compositor D makes from the Quarto copy on pages L2 and L4 v -6 v ( LLL ), but fails to check whether the features apparent there are consistent with other portions of Compositor D's work before generalizing about them. In LLL Compositor D shortens words with a final double ll to a single l seven times. On this evidence Cairncross asserts that Compositor D can be "distinguished specially . . . by the dropping of final l " (p. 44). However, on pages K2 v and K5 v -6 v ( Ado ) Compositor D consistently changes his Quarto copy's single final l to double ll : still (1393), will (1504, 2197, 2382, 2473, 2488), all (2384, 2548), fall (2479), shall (2199, 2215, 2338, 2384), and well (2308). In addition, at least sixteen other instances of this change from single final l to double ll occur elsewhere in Ado in long lines. Finally, the same change from the copy's single final l to double ll occurs, to a lesser degree, in LLL, MND , and MV. 10 Obviously the single final l is not a consistent feature of Compositor D's work and cannot be used to identify him. On the other hand, Cairncross' other spelling standard for Compositor D, the -ie/aie endings, is at least partially accurate. Compositor D does seem to prefer the -ie/aie endings, but some important counter-examples such as day, way, stay, onely, try , and country make mass counts and simple generalizations about -ie/aie endings potentially misleading. In fact, T. H. Howard-Hill is misled into rejecting this feature as evidence for Compositor D by relying on mass counts. In reviewing Cairncross' attributions he asserts, "when one surveys 5 pages (O5 v , O6, T5, V3 and V3 v ) which he attributes (correctly) to D, there are 86 -ie/aie to 70 -y/ay spellings" (pp. 73-74). This use of quantitative evidence is deceiving. First, since Compositor D prefers the -y/ay endings in some words which occur frequently in the text, a comparison of the total number of -y/ay endings with the total number of -ie/aie endings on a single page can be inconclusive or misleading. A single page could have more -y/ay endings than -ie/aie endings and still be set by Compositor D. Second, a comparison between the number of -ie/aie and -y/ay endings in Compositor D's pages needs a standard of reference. We should compare the number of -ie/aie and -y/ay endings in the five pages set by Compositor D listed above with five pages set by Compositor C or Compositor F. When I surveyed five pages (P4 v , P5, T1, V4, and V4 v ) attributed to Compositor C, I counted 132 -y/ay endings and 34 -ie/aie endings. 11 Thus, a larger selection of pages can reveal a difference between compositors, but this generalization provides only limited help when one tries to identify the compositor of a particular page. Although Cairncross' use of -ie/aie endings as evidence for Compositor D must be qualified further, his method of noting the changes the compositor makes from Quarto copy is generally more revealing than simple quantitative, statistical evidence. For Cairncross, once the work of Compositors C and D is isolated, the work of Compositor F is easy to distinguish. Some difficulties arise, however, because Cairncross' standards for determining the work of Compositors C and D need additional support before many ambiguous pages can be identified, and because Compositor F shares a preference for doe, goe, here with Compositor D, and a preference for wee'll with Compositor C. According to Cairncross, the one feature that distinguishes Compositor F from both Compositor C and Compositor D is his preference for the short catchword, the speech prefix without the first word of dialogue. Using this criterion, Cairncross argues that the catchword Sp. I on B4 v is evidence for Compositor C (p. 397), but later he believes that Compositor F is "the only possible compositor" for D3 v (p. 399)— despite its very similar catchword Qu. I . Actually Compositor F set both of these pages. Cairncross is led astray on B4 v because of his reliance on the indented initial speech prefix (B4 v is the head page of Two Gentlemen of Verona ), which I have already shown to be evidence for Compositor F's hand because of its degree of indentation. Cairncross acknowledges, however, the force of the other reasons for believing B4 v was set by Compositor F: " doe-goe-here spellings and short [speech] prefixes, e.g. Sp. , and the x-case used" (p. 398). Compositor F also uses the long catchword (the speech prefix and first word of text) on E3, F3, F5, and G4. These six instances of the long form spoil any generalization about Compositor F's preference for the short form, which he uses on five occasions (B1, C4, C4 v , C5, and D3). Although Compositors C and D prefer the long form, the short catchword is of limited use as evidence for identifying Compositor F. Even when the short form appears, Compositor F did not necessarily set it, since Compositor C will set the short form on occasion, as on D2, K1 v , and K2. Since I have modified or challenged a number of the criteria which Cairncross proposes, let me summarize those criteria which I accept either in their original or modified form: Compositor D Compositor F future-tense contraction -le 'll -ie/aie or -y/ay -ie/y/ay -y/ay usually catchword long form both forms 2nd line of a stage direction centers prefers to center, but will indent initial speech prefix of a play does not set a title page indents 3/4" Obviously these standards will leave many pages unassigned or doubtful, especially since they frequently coincide with Compositor C's preferences. The other scholar who has studied these two compositors is T. H. Howard-Hill. In a long, thorough article, published before Cairncross' essays, he offered elaborate quantitative evidence for isolating the work of four of the Folio compositors. Despite the limitations in his method and occasional errors in his tabulation, Howard-Hill's results are a major accomplishment. In his area of research and his findings Cairncross occasionally overlaps Howard-Hill's earlier research, but Howard-Hill is more successful in distinguishing the new Compositor F of the Comedies from Compositor A of the Histories and Tragedies, and in isolating Compositor C from Compositors D and F. His criteria for separating Compositor D from Compositor F needs some revisions, but they provide a base from which other evidence may be constructed. His three general criteria for identification of the Comedies' compositors are: the future-tense elisions as later adopted by Cairncross, the spacing of commas at the end of a line and inside short lines, and the typographical arrangement of a verse too long for a single line. His main standard, a spaced comma that is the result of setting a spacing quad at the end of a word before a comma, is usually easy to recognize at the end of a line. In fact, the second example shows a spacing quad which was accidentally inked. This spacing of the comma at the end of a line is the distinctive feature of Compositor C's work, and one of the most important discoveries of the article, since it successfully isolates Compositor C, most of the time, from Compositors A, B, D, and F, who rarely leave a space before a comma at the end of a line (p. 68). As a result of this new criterion, Howard-Hill assigns Compositor C many previously undetermined pages. I have adopted this authoritative criterion for identifying Compositor C. The features of Compositor C's work that I have noticed and will describe later are merely supporting evidence, although they are important on prose pages where spacing evidence is usually invalid. Howard-Hill also uses as evidence each compositor's supposedly consistent choice either to make a space after a comma that occurs within a short line or to follow the comma closely with the first letter of the next word. According to Howard-Hill, Compositor B prefers to leave a space after an internal comma; Compositor C also prefers to leave a space after an internal comma, but is not so consistent as Compositor B. Compositors D and F prefer not to leave a space after an internal comma, but Compositor F, Howard-Hill admits, is inconsistent in his spacing practices. In fact, I find the evidence for internal spacing varies so much for both Compositors D and F that it is worthless as an indicator of their work. The proportion of spaced internal commas to non-spaced commas in Compositor D's pages in LLL and MND (L2, L4 v -6 v , N4-5, N6-6 v ) is roughly one to four. But in pages from AWW and Shr (T5-6 v and V3-3 v ) also set by Compositor D, the proportion is roughly one to one, with notable instances of three to one (T5 and V3). Internal spacing practices can offer, at best, a check for assigning pages to Compositors B and C. If the number of unspaced internal commas is greater than the number of spaced ones, Compositor B or Compositor C probably did not set the page. On the other hand, if the number of spaced internal commas is greater than the number of unspaced ones, any of the compositors could have set the page. Compositor D's most distinctive feature for Howard-Hill is his habit of carrying over a verse line too long for his measure to the following line and indenting it two or three ems from the left-hand margin (p. 71). Howard-Hill calls these lines indented turn-overs, but for reasons of clarity I will refer to them as indented flow-overs and thereby avoid confusion with the alternate method of setting an extra-long line, which Compositor F prefers. He sets an extra-long line at the right-hand margin above or below the end of a line; this is a turn-over or turn-under. Howard-Hill charts (p. 71) the frequency of indented flow-overs in the pages that he personally assigns to the compositors: INDENTED FLOW-OVERS B C D F pages 14 2 20 1 frequency 20 2 94 1 Seemingly Compositor D uses indented flow-overs on more pages and more frequently per page than the other compositors, and Howard-Hill concludes: "It is more likely than not that any page with more than one such indented turn-over [indented flow-over] was set by Compositor D, and it is very unlikely to have been set by A(F) or C" (p. 72). Unfortunately, this criterion, and the conclusion, must be modified upon closer examination of the evidence. The ratio of indented flow-overs per page implied in Howard-Hill's chart is misleading. Thirty-six of these indented flow-overs occur on H3 v , which, as we will see shortly, was actually set by Compositor C. Another twenty-seven that Compositor D did set are on 21/2 pages (H4b, and L6-6 v ) of tumbling-verse dialogue like H3 v in Err and LLL , where little or no room exists for a turn-over. The remaining thirty-one indented flow-overs that are set by Compositor D occur on 161/2 pages. Thus the statistical evidence in Howard-Hill's chart is badly distorted. (A similar distortion would be to say that Compositor C set thirty-eight indented flow-overs on three pages.) Compositor D uses the indented flow-over on significantly more pages than Compositors C and F, but the number of occurrences on a single page has little significance; i.e. if an indented flow-over occurs on a page, the page probably belongs to Compositor D, but the number of times it occurs is not important. Despite the fact that Compositor D sets indented flow-overs more frequently, additional evidence is necessary to assure us that the page was not actually set by Compositors B or C, who will use the indented flow-over occasionally. H3 v is an example of how the use of only this standard can mislead. Howard-Hill assigned the page to Compositor D, reasoning that "[C] is unlikely, despite the spaced comma in column a, to have set H3 v which has many indented turn-overs [flow-overs] of verse lines . . . I have assigned the remainder of Err. , where verse turn-overs are frequent, to D" (pp. 82-83). But the indented flow-overs and the solitary spaced comma are not the only evidence on this page. It also contains an indented two-line stage direction, three instances of you'll , and y e , y u , and y t —all evidence for Compositor C. 12 No firm evidence exists for Compositor D. The traditional evidence of doe, goe, here/heere is inconclusive for this page because of the number of long lines requiring justification. do doe go goe here heere H3 v :1 * 1:2 2:1 1:6 :1 Hinman was unable to determine which type case was used for this page because of the generally irregular distribution of type in quires F through H. However, he did trace certain distinctive types through these quires, so that a clear pattern emerges here and there. Eight of Hinman's distinctive types appear on this page, but only one also appears in a column set by Compositor D before or after H3 v , whereas the rest appear in columns associated with the y-case and Compositors B and C (II, 388). Also, only three -ie spellings occur on this page, despite indications that the Folio copy had -ie spellings. 13 Thus the evidence for Compositor C is considerable, even if no piece of evidence is conclusive by itself. Although the evidence from indented flow-overs is not so clearcut as Howard-Hill thought, it is still a valuable start for separating the work of Compositors D and F. And despite my examples of Howard-Hill's misuse of quantitative evidence, his work is usually judicious and I will frequently refer to his discussion of particular quires in the Comedies. My examination of the recent work in compositorial analysis has focused primarily on Compositor D, since both Cairncross and Howard-Hill have failed to develop sufficient standards to distinguish him from the other compositors, especially Compositor F. A possible first step in determining which pages belong to Compositors D and F is to decide which pages were not set by them. This "negative" method is why I have evaluated the evidence offered by Howard-Hill for identifying Compositor C, who is most likely to be confused with Compositors D and F, and why I wish to add another criterion for Compositor C that is particularly useful on pages where the other distinctions are ineffective. Although Howard-Hill's criterion of the spaced final comma is adequate for many pages in the Folio, a difficulty arises when one is confronted with a page containing mostly prose. Since most spelling tests are also less trustworthy if not invalid when the word is in a justified line as in prose, further evidence is needed to identify Compositor C on such pages. Fortunately, Compositor C has another spacing-spelling habit which he employs on these pages. He contracts yet, you , and occasionally we by placing the last letter above the first. Although Compositor B also uses this technique, other evidence can easily distinguish him from Compositor C. In the Comedies I have counted thirty-eight instances of these contractions outside of Compositor B's pages. 14 Twenty-five of the contractions occur on pages every-one agrees belong to Compositor C. Since these contractions never appear on the undisputed pages of either Compositor D or Compositor F, despite frequent occasions for them to save space by contracting yet, you , and we , I believe the remaining thirteen contractions on eight pages (D2 v , F4 v , G4 v , H2 v , H3 v , I4, K5, and M1) are sound evidence for Compositor C. On these eight pages other evidence also suggests Compositor C, although the contractions are especially important on pages D2 v , F4 v , G4 v , H3 v , and O2, where they confirm Howard-Hill's tentative assignments. Determining which pages belong to Compositor C solves only part of the problem of identifying Compositors D and F: it is time to suggest further standards for identifying their work. When describing Compositor D, Hinman (I, 196) assigned him only pages set from the new case z, which was used for parts of quires K-L and N-Q. These quires, with the exception of Q, contain the comedies that used Quartos for their copy (quire K: Ado ; quire L; LLL ; quire N: MND ; quires O and P: MV ). If we adopt as a temporary hypothesis that, at the least, Compositor D is responsible for the pages set from case z, we can make some generalizations about his distinctive features on these pages by noting the changes from the Quarto copy; then we should check back to see if any of the pages involved appear anomalous according to his identified characteristics. Later we will add pages from quires T and V set from a case made up de novo , which Hinman calls case x (II, 443, 452), and a few columns in quires F and H, where the case evidence is confused. This evidence suggests that Compositor D entered the Folio in quire F, after the printing of Wilson's Christian Dictionary was finished, that he completely replaced Compositor F after MM , and that he left during a "major interruption" in the printing of the Folio in quire V (II, 462). He was then replaced by Compositor A, who worked on the remainder of the Folio. Most of the features that are characteristic of Compositor D are also features of either Compositor C or Compositor F. Thus, some of Compositor D's characteristics can be contrasted only with Compositor C's; some other evidence must separate Compositor D from Compositor F. The spelling variant most apparent in the z-case pages is the frequent use of -ie endings. But the many -y endings also on these pages make any large generalizations dangerous and misleading. First, one must distinguish between Compositor D's choice of -y or -ie endings after a consonant or after a vowel. Cairncross has argued that Compositor D prefers final -aie over -ay (p. 74). But, with the exception of nineteen instances of praie (in contrast to thirty-three instances of pray ), Compositor D consistently prefers final -y after all vowels. He will, it is true, often change -ay- to -ai- in the plural form of a word ending in -ay , as in waies and saies , but this variant is frequently used by all of the Folio compositors. Second, although Compositor D often changes word endings after consonants from -y to -ie , he frequently retains the -y endings from the copy, and in any simple mass count their frequency would hide his actual preference for -ie. Some qualifying adjectives are a good example of his inconsistency and of the problem of using -ie endings as evidence. From his extant copy, the four Quartos, Compositor D changed any to anie four times in short lines and six times in long lines. He retained the any copy spelling seven times in short lines and eight times in long lines. With very he changed copy -y to -ie five times in short lines and nine times in long lines, and retained three short-line copy -ie endings. He retained very in two short lines and eight long lines, and changed a copy -ie ending in one long line. With every his preference for -ie is not so strong: one change from -y to -ie in a short line and one in a long line; one copy -ie retained in a short line; four copy -y endings retained in short lines and five in long lines; and one copy -ie in a short line changed to -y. A chart reveals more clearly Compositor D's preferences, and the difficulty of generalizing from them: The bottom line shows how mass counts may hide actual preferences. Nevertheless, occurrences of anie, verie , and everie will be used as evidence for Compositor D, since, as we will see later, Compositor F never uses the -ie ending for these words. Along with the qualifying adjectives listed above, some other words reflect Compositor D's preference for -ie endings after a consonant despite his acceptance of many of the copy's -y endings. Included in this group of variants are: beautie, companie, giddie, heavie, heresie, Ladie, marrie, pittie, presentlie, prettie , and readie . After we examine quires T and V, more words will be added to this list, and indeed some of these new words occur as frequently as the adjectives listed above. The strength of Compositor D's preference for the -ie ending, however, is not consistent throughout the list. In the list below the variants can be used to distinguish Compositor D from Compositor F in the same way as the qualifying adjectives. Lady/Ladie is a particularly good example of how a word with a greater number of -y endings than -ie endings can still be an indicator for Compositor D. Despite his frequent use of the -y endings, Compositor D also uses the -ie for Lady , which Compositor F never uses. This list of words, properly employed, can be the best standard for separating Compositor D from Compositor F. When one of these words appears with an -ie ending, it is a clear sign of Compositor D's hand, since Compositor F never uses the -ie ending for these words. This criterion holds only for these fourteen words, since both compositors will set an -ie ending for some other words. Compositor D sets many more -ie endings than Compositor F, but an individual instance of an -ie or -y ending (other than from the above list) can prove nothing. A second spelling habit of Compositor D's that can be isolated by noting his changes from copy is eie for eye . Unfortunately, the analogous changes flie for flye, die for dye , and lie for lye are useless for distinguishing Compositor D from Compositor F. Although Compositor D generally prefers the -i- spellings, and Compositor F the -y- spellings, enough exceptions are present to make these variants useless as evidence. As with the final -y/ie , Compositor D's preference is not absolute here either, but Compositor F's preference for eye is absolute. With these two distinctive spelling habits of Compositor D's, we can go back and check to see if all the pages set from case z actually were the work of Compositor D. This check is essential since the above statistics cannot tell us if the -ie endings and eie spellings are clustered on only a few pages and missing on other groups of z-case pages, which would suggest that another compositor also used the z-case. In fact, both Hinman (in quires O and P) and Howard-Hill (in quire P) think some of the pages set with the z-case were done by Compositor F. The chart below shows on what pages the test words, with either an -ie or a -y ending, appear. An instance of an -ie ending of a test word is solid evidence of Compositor D; pages with only -y endings may have been set by either compositor. Although this chart does not prove conclusively that case z was used only by Compositor D, the evidence is plentiful that he set at least the pages in quires K, N, and Q. L2 and O5 v do not contain any decisive evidence, but the other pages in both of these quires clearly belong to Compositor D. Simple continuity is evidence against assigning these isolated pages to Compositor F. Portions of quire P show fewer signs of Compositor D's hand, although at least one -ie ending of a test word occurs on each page (except P1 v a). Later, additional evidence will support the assignment of Compositor D to all of these pages. In the discussion of Compositor D's habits I have already mentioned several of Compositor F's traits that differentiate him from Compositor D. Before I examine the pages outside of case z that belong either to Compositor D or to Compositor F, two more habits of Compositor F's can be added to the identifying criteria. Neither of these traits appears in the z-case pages. Both Compositors D and F generally prefer a final -e when the word has a complex vowel. 15 Howard-Hill used indeed/indeede , for instance, to separate Compositors D and F from Compositor C, who frequently does not add the final -e after a complex vowel. With maid and meet , however, Compositor F prefers the shorter form, although he will use the long form of maide and meete on occasion. Compositor D, differing from his usual inconsistency in spelling, is absolutely consistent in using only the long form for both maide and meete . With sweet the situation is reversed: Compositor F uses only the short form, sweet , and Compositor D uses both forms. Compositor D, though preferring sweet on occasion, retains sweete so often that it can be used to distinguish him from Compositor F. As evidence, the variant spellings of maid and meet must be applied separately from the variant spellings of sweet . The short form of either maid or meet appears only in Compositor F's pages, and the long form of sweete appears only in the work of Compositor D. The second of Compositor F's habits that distinguish him from Compositor D is a minor punctuation habit—or lack of it. Compositor D never uses an apostrophe when a possessive proper noun is in italics, for example Lysanders (N5: 1098). Although Compositor F frequently fails to put in the apostrophe, he does use it often enough to aid in differentiating the two of them. This standard can also be applied to Compositor C, whose habit is similar to Compositor F's except that Compositor C does not always italicize the final s after an apostrophe (particularly in MV ), as in Anthonio 's (P4 v : 1643), whereas Compositor F always italicizes the final s . Most of the identification of Compositor F has been through a process of elimination. Compositor F is distinguished, for the most part, by the absence of Compositor D's traits on non-Compositor C pages. However, certain features, as the elision we'll or they'll or the two habits just described, are positive evidence. Also, Compositor F's preference for shorter speech prefixes, which Cairncross first noted, is a habit that can be important in the quire-by-quire examination, but this feature cannot be easily generalized, since it depends upon specific characters' names. The first section of text to which we can apply the new standards for separating Compositors D and F are the pages in quires T and V ( Shr and AWW ) where an ad hoc case "x" was used. According to Hinman, cases x and z were "liquidated during the course of the work done for quire R" (II, 441). Hinman speculated that the Folio was going to become a single-case project, but for some reason in quires T and V a second case, made up de novo , appears and a second compositor shares the work with Compositor B, who continued to use case y (II, 443). Hinman thought the workman who shared these quires with Compositor B was Compositor A (F); Howard-Hill argues for Compositor D. In the chart below, those columns which offer strong evidence of Compositor D's work are italicized. (See chart on p. 99) We can add to this evidence in the chart two -le elisions, Weele (T5: 2239) and Youle (V3: 411), and at least one indented flow-over on each of the six pages. Because of these features plus no clear evidence for Compositor F, I support Howard-Hill's re-assignment of these pages to Compositor D. From these pages we can add a few more words to the list of -ie spellings used to separate Compositor D from Compositor F. These words appeared too infrequently before to be of much value. When they did occur in the z-case pages, Compositor D usually changed the copy -y ending to -ie (the first column below). As the figures in parentheses below show, these words appear more frequently in quires T and V, where the copy spellings are unknown. For some of these words, as denie , dutie , and twentie , Compositor D shows a strong—potentially absolute—preference for the -ie ending. Now that quires T and V have been added to Compositor D's canon, and more words have been added to the test list that identifies Compositor D, we can move on to an earlier group of quires linked together by a common case (x), quires A-E ( Temp, TGV and Wiv ). I have tacitly assumed these pages to be Compositor F's in my discussion of Compositor F's characteristics. Now we must test that assumption. With the exception of a few specific pages, all three scholars who have worked with the Comedies' compositors have assigned these pages to F(A). I have again italicized the columns that would identify Compositor D if he were present. The chart reveals almost no evidence for Compositor D. The single -ie ending on B3 v ( Companie , 2245) is obviously an anomaly. Although none of this evidence is overwhelming, enough differences exist in order to distinguish Compositor F from Compositor D, especially when the above evidence is coupled with the absence of any indented flow-overs and the presence of twenty-one -'ll contractions. 16 The remaining section of the Comedies, quires F-H ( MM and Err ), which was set by three, possibly four, compositors is so confused in its type distribution that Hinman was unable to determine which case was used for each page. The main cause of this confusion was the completion of Wilson's Christian Dictionary , which permitted the Folio compositors to use a stock of type previously tied up; Hinman remarks it is "perfectly clear that the printers of the Folio found themselves in a position to make a fresh start, so to speak, with quire F" (II, 378). The fresh start included many new types and a second skeleton, which suggests "two compositors simultaneously at work on the two pages of each successive form" (II, 379). But this new start upset the routine established in the earlier quires. Three or four compositors working with two cases and two skeletons tried to develop new practices, and the confusion in these three quires appears to be the result of trial and error arrangements. In order to identify who set which pages and columns, we must examine the quires closely, page by page, using criteria unique to these plays as well as the criteria previously developed. Everyone who has attempted to determine the number of compositors—and which pages they set—in quires F and G ( MM ) has agreed that the frequent lack of solid and consistent evidence makes these quires the most vexing and challenging in the Comedies. Although scholars agree that determining each compositor's share in these quires is difficult, they differ significantly in their solutions, as the following chart shows: The Compositors in Measure for Measure Hinman Howard-Hill Cairncross O'Connor F1 A? C/D C C F1 v D D/C D C F2 D C/D F C/D F2 v C C F D F3 D D D D F3 v A C F C F4 A C D C F4 v A C D C F5 D C/D D C/D F5 v B B B B F6 B B B B F6 v D D/C C C G1 D B/D E? B/C G1 v D?

C C C If Howard-Hill is correct in his assertion that many of the pages were split between compositors, as they experimented in search of an efficient method, the problem of proving who set what column becomes even more difficult. As before, the first step in deciding which pages were set by Compositors D and F is to remove some pages—those set by Compositors B and C—from consideration. As would be expected, everyone agrees about most of Compositor B's stint: F5 v -6 and G2 v -3 v . His role is less certain on G1 r a and G1 v , but I support Howard-Hill's assignment of these pages to Compositor B. Disagreement about G1 v is not so great as may appear in the above chart, since Hinman, while assigning the page to Compositor D, felt G1 v was "more suggestive of B than D, since both its 'doe-goe' spellings are in long lines (as its two 'do-go' spellings are not) and since Compositor D normally preferred 'here' to 'heere'" (I, 408). Hinman did not assign the page to Compositor B because he had not set either G1 or G2, but this reason is invalid when G1 r a is assigned to Compositor B. Further evidence presented by Howard-Hill confirms Hinman's suspicion that Compositor B actually set G1 v : three instances of Friar (Compositor B used it five other times in quire G) rather than Frier , which the other compositors preferred; and the lack of spaced final commas, despite a clear preference for spaced internal commas (p. 79). As for G1 r a, both Howard-Hill and Cairncross offer reasons for assigning it to Compositor B: four do/go spellings in short lines against one goe and one here's (Compositor B's habitual spelling of this contraction according to Howard-Hill) in long lines; a distinct preference for spaced internal commas, but no spaced final commas; and "spellings incompatible with the habits of the other compositors, including D" (Howard-Hill, p. 79). Previous scholars have not assigned the b-column of G1 r a to Compositor B because of two instances of goe in a short line and doe in a long line. Another feature in column b that suggests a second workman is four instances of Frier ; Compositor B always set Friar , including once in G1 r a. The compositor who set column b preferred Duke . rather than Duk. as the speech heading ( Duke. 8:3 against Duk. :1), and set the short catchword, Luc. . This evidence eliminates Compositor D, since he clearly preferred Duk. elsewhere and never set the shorter form of the catchword. Compositor F is also eliminated because of the speech prefix Duke. , and eight instances of Duke in roman type in the text; Compositor F set Duke in italic all sixteen times it occurred in his pages of quire G. This same evidence supports the assignment of Compositor C to this column. He preferred Duke. as a speech heading, and he seems indifferent to whether Duke in the text was in italic or roman. Although Compositor C usually set the longer form of the catchword, he does use the shorter form on occasion, as on D2, I4 v , and K2. Since most of the column is in prose, spelling and spacing evidence are not entirely trustworthy, but they do not run counter to Compositor C's known preferences. With Compositor B's pages settled (F5 v -6, G1 r a, G1 v , G2 v -3 v ), we can turn our attention to Compositor C. Unfortunately, Compositor C does not inspire the same agreement among scholars as Compositor B. Howard-Hill assigns him the most columns, and offers the most convincing evidence to support his assignments. The following chart, adapted from his article, shows the criteria he used in quires F and G, and the columns that he assigns to Compositor C. After the sub-totals I have included those columns that I will later add to Compositor C's stint. 17 As Howard-Hill shows, spaced final commas are often sufficient evidence to isolate Compositor C; more than two spaced final commas occur on F2 r a, F4-5 r a, G4 r a, G5, and G6 r a. And if pages F4 and F4 v were set by Compositor C, then F3 v was most likely set by him also. Hinman linked F3 v -4 v together through type recurrence (II, 381), and spelling and spacing features are similar on all three pages. The chart also reveals Compositor C's clear preference for doe/goe/heere on F1 v b, F6 v b, and G4 v b. G2 r b is assigned to Compositor C because of a combination of minor features: heere in a long line, Duke as the preferred speech heading, and the elision shee'll (Compositor F generally prefers a single e in she'll or he'll ). Another occurrence of shee'll on G6 v supports Howard-Hill's assignment of that short page to Compositor F. The other two pages, F1 r a and F2 v a, that Howard-Hill assigned to Compositor C need closer examination. On F1, Howard-Hill assigns Compositor C the first column and Compositor D the second, but he does not show why the page should be divided. Nor can I see a reason for the split. As I will suggest later when discussing Compositor D, the lack of significant contrasts in spelling and the similarity of the two columns in their spacing of commas makes me think the whole page was set by one man, Compositor C. With F2 v it is a matter of subtracting columns from Compositor C's share rather than adding to it. The most striking feature on F2 v , which everyone has noticed, is seventeen instances of Isa. (instead of Isab. ) as the speech heading. Compositor B is the only workman who habitually uses this shorter form, but the frequency of doe/goe (5:1) precludes assigning him this page. Howard-Hill, assigning the page to Compositor C, asserted that "in this first page in which he encountered Isa. Compositor C followed copy" (p. 81). But F2 v is not the first page where Compositor C would face a choice between Isa. and Isab. as speech heading. Since the innermost forme of a quire was set first, Compositor C would already have set the longer form thirteen times on F4 and ten times on F4 v ; he does use the short form once in a long line on F4 v . It is unlikely Compositor C would set the longer form on two pages, switch to the shorter form on F2 v , and then return to the longer form on F5. Another contrast in spelling between F2 v and Compositor C's preference elsewhere in the quire is praier/prayer . Compositor C sets prayer , his usual spelling, three times on F4 v , but praier is set on F2 v . Further support for re-assignment of F2 v comes from Hinman's case evidence. Hinman managed to find occasional patterns of type recurrence in quire F, and he thought that F3 and F2 v were set from the same case—a different case from the one used for F3 v -4 v (II, 381). Since Compositor D probably set F3 and Compositor C set F3 v -4 v , Compositor C would have had to switch cases along with his spelling of Isab. and prayer when he started F2 v . Howard-Hill was led astray on this page by a crucial tabulation error in his spacing chart (p. 78). He lists twenty spaced medial commas and six non-spaced medial commas, but I find only thirteen spaced medial commas and thirty non-spaced medial commas, which would be strong evidence against Compositor C. Thus, F2 v seems to be a non-Compositor C page, set by either Compositor D or Compositor F. Now that we have finished a survey of Compositor B's and Compositor C's work in quires F and G, we can begin to distinguish between Compositors D and F in these two quires. The pages not assigned to Compositors B and C are: F1 r b-1 v a, F2 r b-3, F5 r b, G2 r a, G4 r b, G4 v a, and G5 v -6 r a. As the following chart shows, the pages in quire G contain more distinctive features than the pages in quire F, and should be easier to assign. As previously, I have italicized those columns that would identify Compositor D if he were indeed present. The pages in quire G have a number of Compositor F's characteristic features: an apostrophe before the s in italicized proper nouns on G4 v a, G5 v , and G6 r a; maid on G2 r a, G4 r b, and G5 v ; she'll and we'll on G5 v ; Duke and Provost in italic on each page except G2 r a; and no -ie endings in the twenty test words of the previous chapter. These features are particularly significant because they contrast completely with Compositor D's habits, thus suggesting that Compositor F alone is responsible for the seven columns in quire G. In assigning Compositor F these columns in quire G, I disagree with Howard-Hill about only one column, G2 r a, which he assigns to Compositor D. Compositor D, however, has been absent for five formes and does not reappear until quire H. Strong evidence would be necessary in order to assign him this single column in the middle of quire G. In fact, the evidence suggests that Compositor F set this column: besides the short form of maid mentioned above, there is the contraction ith' , which Compositor F sets frequently in other plays (Howard-Hill, p. 105), and which Compositor D never uses. Also, the -y endings of heavy (1806) and body (1786j) are counter to Compositor D's strong preference for an -ie ending for these words. Thus, I feel Compositor D is not involved in any of quire G, and Compositor F set G2 r a, G4 r b-4 v a, G5 v , and G6 r a. In quire F, the question whether only Compositor D or only Compositor F, or both, set the 'left-over' pages is not so simply settled. The principal reason is the lack of distinctive features with which to work. The chart provides little evidence, and some of it potentially contradictory, from which to base an argument for or against Compositor D or Compositor F. Another part of the problem is that although we can describe Compositor F's preferences by referring to quire G, we are unsure of Compositor D's preferences on these features unique to MM. For example, Compositor F prefers Duk. rather than Duke. in the speech headings, but instances of Duk. in quire F cannot be treated as evidence for Compositor F, since Compositor D may also prefer the shorter form. It would be tempting to argue that Compositor D does not begin work on the Folio until quire H—or even quire K and the appearance of case z—and that he replaces Compositor F, who worked through quire G. But this hypothesis is spoiled by certain key features on F3. The most important feature on this page is youle (589), which has led all scholars to assign this page to Compositor D. Although Compositor D is capable of setting they'll , as in Err , he never sets 'll after a vowel; plus, Compositor F never uses the -le form after any personal pronoun. Other features on this page also make it unlikely that Compositor F set it: two instances of do and two of go in short lines (Compositor F sets do/go only four times in short lines in all of his Folio pages), and Dukes (502) in roman type. Thus it appears that Compositor D set F3, and that his work in the Folio overlaps, rather than follows, Compositor F's. One problem with assigning Compositor D F3 is the notable absence of -ie endings, including such test words as deny and pitty . Once we have established that F3 was set by Compositor D, we can begin to look on the other 'left-over' pages in quire F for features similar to those in F3. Earlier F3 was linked to F2 v through case evidence; other features on this page strengthen this link and contrast neatly with features in the G-quire pages set by Compositor F. For example, Duke and Provost occur once each in roman type on F2 v ; Duke is in roman type on F3, and these settings in roman type contrast with Compositor F's clear preference for italic in quire G. A second contrast between F2 v and Compositor F's practices in quire G is the spelling of Isa. (17 times) for the speech heading on F2 v , which differs from Compositor F's choice of Isab. in quire G ( Isab. 19 times, Isa. twice). Another feature that suggests that Compositor D set F2 v is the increased number of -ie endings, notably unhappie (370), storie (380), libertie (414), and Abilitie's (430). A final, minor spelling variant on F2 v , Praier (421), is frequently used by Compositor D, whereas Compositor F chooses prayer . Sig. F5, the forme-mate of F2 v , is split with Compositor C responsible for the first column. In column a, Compositor C spaces three final commas and clearly prefers to space internal commas (16 spaced, 6 not spaced); column b is just the opposite, with no spaced final commas and few spaced internal commas (4 spaced, 24 not spaced). Some slight spelling differences between the two columns support this division: die (994, 997, 1040) vs. dye (1091), and appear (1033) vs. appeare (1086j). In the second column two instances of do , a number of -ie endings, and another instance of praier all suggest Compositor D set the second half of the page. However, some problems arise when Compositor D is assigned this column. First, some of the spellings are counter to strong preferences Compositor D exhibits later in the Folio; for example, suit (1077), dye (1091), body (1058), and beauty (1088). Second, Isab. is set nine times as a speech prefix in this column, but Compositor D used Isa. on F2 v . One might expect some transitional fluctuation between Isa. and Isab. , rather than this sudden change within a single forme. Despite these possible conflicts, I agree with Howard-Hill that this column belongs to Compositor D (the other compositors are even more unlikely). Compositors C and D continued to split the work on the next page they set, F2. The evidence on F2 is similar to that on F5, only neater. Column a is assigned to Compositor C because of spacing evidence: three final spaced commas, twenty-one spaced internal commas and only one non-spaced internal comma. They'll in line 236 is supporting evidence. Column b was probably not set by Compositor C, since the spacing of commas is just the reverse: no final spaced commas, six spaced internal commas and twenty-five non-spaced internal commas. The spellings of do (2), here , and indeede , and the Duk. speech headings also conflict with Compositor C's preferences. The two do spellings are evidence against Compositor F, since he rarely set do in a short line (a total of three times in the Comedies). Thus, by a process of elimination Compositor D is assigned as Compositor C's partner. Unlike F5b, no features in F2b seem to conflict with Compositor D's usual practices. Howard-Hill also splits F1 v , F1, and F6 v , but I do not find significant differences between columns on these pages, nor do I find evidence of Compositor D's involvement. Howard-Hill assigns column b of F1 v to Compositor C for good reasons, but he is silent about why he assigns column a to Compositor D. Spacing and spelling evidence does not suggest that two compositors shared the page. The spacing evidence is slight because of the number of long lines in both columns, and the difference between columns in the spacing of commas in short lines is so small that an argument for splitting the page would have to be based on other evidence. Spelling also offers no significant contrasts. In fact, the occurrence of indeed in column a, even in a long line, is evidence against Compositors D and F, since both men strongly prefer indeede ; both compositors set indeed only once each in all of their Folio pages. The one anomalous feature in column a is Duke (97) in italic. On previous pages in this quire Compositor C has set Duke in italic once (F3 v ) and in roman twice (F2 r a); Compositor D has set Duke in roman both times it occurred before (F3 and F2 v ); Compositor F consistently prefers to set Duke in italic in quire G. Although Compositor F may have set this column, I think the spellings of do , praies , and indeed make it unlikely. Moreover, this column would be his only work in the F quire. I find it considerably easier to assign the whole page to Compositor C, and argue that he is inconsistent in his setting of Duke and Provost in italic or roman. As with F1 v , Howard-Hill is silent about why he split F1, saying only that "there is not much useful evidence on F1 and F1 v " (p. 81). But in fact, the spacing evidence on this page suggests that only Compositor C was involved, since one spaced final comma occurs in each column. Compositor D, the supposed partner, rarely sets a spaced final comma. Spelling evidence is slight, and the only possible variant that might suggest Compositor D was involved is here (66) in column b. But here is probably the copy spelling, 18 and Compositor C sets it at least ten times in short lines in MM . Finally, an indented flow-over is set in line 84; but as we saw earlier, Compositor C will use this device if there is no room for a turn-over or turn-under, which seems to be the problem here. In short, I do not see any evidence that would justify splitting F1 and assigning column b to Compositor D. Howard-Hill also split F1's forme-mate, F6 v . Part of his reason for splitting F6 v was the supposed division of F1: "F6 v b is C's as also the other column may be, but the 'do' spellings there encourage me to maintain the division of quire F between C and D" (p. 82). But Compositor D seems not to have worked on the last two formes of quire F, and besides any argument from normalcy is of little value in this quire. The other reason for splitting the page, three instances of do in long lines, is not adequate evidence for distinguishing Compositor D from Compositor C. Compositor C sets do frequently on other pages in quire F—three times in short lines, six in long lines. Evidence against Compositor D is a number of non-Compositor D spellings in column b: ready (1391), company (1399), body (1404j), and beauty (1402j). I do not think that this page needs to be split; Compositor C set all of it. In conclusion, Compositor D is involved in MM , but only briefly. He set F2 r b, F2 v , and F3. Compositor F worked in quire G—his last quire in the Folio—setting G2 r a, G4 r b-4 v a, G5 v a-6 r a. After quires F and G, the problems in quire H are minor. The task of determining the compositors is eased first, because Hinman was again able to trace some type recurrence, and second, because Howard-Hill was able to apply his spacing criterion effectively in a play that is 90% verse. Hinman matched case evidence to spelling variants and correctly assigned pages H4 v -5 and H6-6 v to Compositor B. These four pages were set from one case; the remaining eight pages were all set from a second case (II, 391). Hinman's choice of Compositor D as Compositor B's partner in this quire has been challenged by both Cairncross and Howard-Hill, who think Compositor C set most (all according to Cairncross) of the non-Compositor B pages. Using spaced final commas as his primary evidence, Howard-Hill correctly assigns H1-1 v a, H2 r b-3 r a, and H4 r a to Compositor C. The lack of spaced final commas and the contrasts in spelling between columns led him to assign the rest, H1 v b-2 r a, H3 r b-3 v , H4 r b, and H5 v , to a third compositor. As the following chart shows, the contrasts between some of the columns are so striking that only another compositor can account for them. The two full pages Howard-Hill assigned Compositor D are discussed elsewhere: H3 v has already been re-assigned to Compositor C (page 91), and H5 v will be examined shortly. Howard-Hill chose Compositor D rather than Compositor F, because of the frequent indented flow-overs on these pages. 19 The evidence I developed earlier supports his assignments. A look at the following chart shows that Compositor D—rather than Compositor F—had to be the third compositor in quire H. The italicized columns identify Compositor D. Thus, the last quire that Compositor F helped set before quitting work on the Folio was quire G. Although this chart eliminates Compositor F, it raises the major difficulty in assigning at least some of these columns to Compositor D. The difficulty is that the three elisions, occurring on H2 r a, H3 r b, and H5 v , are counter to Compositor D's clear preference for -le . Everyone agrees that the -le elision is one of the most telling signs of Compositor D's hand; he used it on F3 and in later quires he changes Quarto copy 'll spellings to -le . Therefore, these anomalies should not be ignored or easily dismissed. Before attempting to explain these anomalies, I wish to separate the two instances of they'll (H2 r a and H3 r b) from the one instance of wee'll (H5 v ); I think that Compositor D set the they'll elisions, but that Compositor C set the wee'll elision. The argument that Compositor D prefers theyl rather than they'll is based on analogy. Scholars have assumed he prefers the -le form with all personal pronouns because he so clearly prefers youle , weele , heele , and sheele ; but Compositor D does not actually contract "they will" anywhere else in the Folio. Unlike the other compositors, he might have distinguished between contracting a pronoun ending in a vowel and a pronoun ending in a consonant. When we look at the two columns where they'll occurs, it seems inescapable that D was the compositor involved. The evidence is overwhelming that a second workman shared H2 with Compositor C: five instances of mistris in column a versus six instances of mistresse in column b; eie and libertie (twice) in column a versus eye and liberty in column b; speech prefixes Luc. and Adr. in column a versus Luci. and Adri. in column b; heere in column b; and a centered (rather than indented) two-line stage direction in column a. Since this evidence eliminates Compositors B and F, and matches Compositor D's preferences, he must have set H2a, including they'll . Since Compositor D set they'll on H2 the occurrence of they'll on H3a, where the argument is the same, is anti-climactic. The elision wee'll (1242) on H5 v b is another matter, however, since Compositor D did set weele the other five times he contracted "we will." Yet almost all the other features on H5 v suggest that Compositor D set the page. The eight instances of here and two of mistris , the lack of spaced final commas, and the recurrence of type from H3 r b in column b of H5 v are all evidence for Compositor D. However, another anomalous spelling occurs at the end of the page, near wee'll , that makes me question whether Compositor D set all of H5 v . In line 1250 is the variant gon , which would be a unique spelling of gone in Compositor D's Folio pages. Compositor C, on the other hand, sets gon at least ten times in the Folio. 20 These two variants, wee'll and gon , that Compositor D never sets in the Folio but that Compositor C sets with some frequency, suggest that Compositor C took over from Compositor D somewhere in column b. The last line that is clearly Compositor D's is 1232, because of Mistris . Two lines later a short prose line might be the last line that Compositor D set in this column. And (1235) could have fitted after the colon in line 1234, as an analogous situation in the same column shows: Although this short line in a prose passage is not unique, it is unusual enough to be slight evidence that something irregular happened. If Compositor C took over at this point, the anomalous spellings wee'll and gon would be accounted for. Since the two men shared the forme-mate, F2, and split the next page to be set, F1 v , Compositor C could have helped finish this page after being temporarily called away. In short, I accept Howard-Hill's assignments in quire H with the exception of H3 v and the last twenty lines of H5 v , which I assign to Compositor C rather than Compositor D. I began my examination of Compositor D by linking him to case z, which first appeared in quire K, and I saved for last quires F-H where the case evidence was very confused. In the process quire I ( Ado ), and one more page set by Compositor D, was skipped. Hinman thought "Compositor D evidently had nothing to do with quire I" (II, 396), and Howard-Hill and Cairncross agree. They assigned I1-3 and I5 r b to Compositor B, and the rest to a second workman—Compositor A for Hinman, Compositor C for Howard-Hill and Cairncross. I agree that Compositor C set I4-5 r a and I5 v -6 v , but I find so many features on I3 v contrasting with those on the pages which follow that a third compositor must have set it. Howard-Hill lists, but seems to have overlooked, some of the evidence against Compositor C: indeede (211), here twice (145, 198) in long lines, don (198) in italic, and a strong preference for unspaced internal commas (12 to 1) in short lines. Another feature on I3 v that conflicts with the pages set by Compositor C is the speech prefix Pedr. , which is shortened four times (2:2) from the Quarto copy's Pedro . (Compositor C sets Pedro. twenty-nine times, and the shorter variant twice in long lines). Finally, the compositor of I3 v preferred a number of -ie endings: worthie (214, 222), Ladie (115, 161, 182, 214), and beautie (186). In later pages in the same play, Compositor C chose the -y ending for each of these words: worthy (I6 v ), beauty (K3 v ), and Lady (I5 r a, I5 v -6 v , K1, K2, and K3-4 v ). This evidence of a third compositor is also evidence for Compositor D. Each of the features listed above is characteristic of his work. Compositor D and Compositor C split the opening forme, I3 v -I4, of quire I; then Compositor B replaced Compositor D for the rest of the quire. The final pages we must examine make up the first half of quire P ( MV ). These were included in the earlier survey of z-case pages, but they merit further consideration because the criteria used in that survey were inadequate for determining absolutely the compositor(s) of P1-3 v and because of new case evidence. Although Compositor F's last appearance was in quire G, both Hinman and Howard-Hill feel he returned to the Folio to set part of quire P. Both men assign P2-3 v to Compositor F, but acknowledge Compositor D as a possibility. Howard-Hill stated, "The spellings of MV are not so clear that it can be certain that every page has been correctly assigned to A[F] and D, and a closer analysis may find that all pages set from case z were set by compositor D" (p. 83). Compositor F has not been involved in the previous eight quires, and some very persuasive evidence would be essential in order to prove he returns to the Folio to set four pages in quire P and then to drop out for good. The feature in these pages on which Hinman and Howard-Hill support their assignments is the lack of do/go spellings, which Compositor D occasionally sets despite a preference for doe/goe . Against this rather weak evidence—especially considering doe/goe were the copy spellings—are spelling variants and case evidence that suggest Compositor D was the compositor of P2-3 v . As an earlier chart showed (p. 00), P3 v contains the characteristic features of Compositor D, which are seen so clearly at the end of the O quire. On P3 v the compositor changes eye to eie three times, and changes the -y copy endings of four of the test words to -ie ( verie , 1379; happie , 1380; manie , 1429; and beautie , 1434, 1445). These distinctive spellings are supported by nine other -ie endings that have been changed from the -y ending of the Quarto copy. 21 On the next page, P3, the evidence for Compositor D is almost as strong. The most telling piece of evidence for Compositor D is the elision youle (1354). Also on this page the compositor changes one -y ending of a test word to -ie in a long line, and retains one copy -ie ending of a test word in a short line; four other -y endings are changed to -ie . 22 Finally, the variants bloud (1251) and praier (1237), which occur on this page, run counter to Compositor F's preference for blood and prayer . The evidence for Compositor D is not so plentiful on the remaining two pages, but the burden of proof has shifted against Compositor F. On P2 v the compositor set sweete (1208) and heresie (1195), which were test words for Compositor D earlier. The general preference for -ie endings that characterized P3-3 v is not so strong here, but three words besides heresie also end in -ie . On P2 go (1052) and Ladie (1001) are strong evidence for Compositor D. Although the evidence is slighter for Compositor D on these two pages, no feature on these four pages suggests that Compositor D did not set them. As each page is assigned to Compositor D, the argument that only Compositor D used the z-case (which was used for P1 r a, P1 v -3 v ) becomes stronger. The z-case seemed to have been first used in quire N so that Compositor D could set type at the same time as two other workmen with two other cases. That situation arose again in quire P; Compositor B set P5 v b with case y, while Compositor C set P5 v a with case x, and Compositor D set P2, the forme-mate, with case z. A similar arrangement occurred in the next two formes, P1 v -6 and P1-6 v . Hinman commented on the splitting of P6 and P6 v , but does not mention the split of P1 v nor has anyone previously assigned two compositors to P1 v . The division of the page does not occur at the column break, but rather about a quarter of the way down column a, with Compositor D responsible for the final forty-seven lines in column a. Fortunately, a large number of distinctive types appear on this page. Seven distinctive types from case z, last seen in P3 r b, are set in column a beginning at line 385. Earlier in the same column at lines 866 and 873 appear two distinctive types from case x, previously used in P4 v . In column b only distinctive types from case x occur (nine times), most of them also coming from P4 v . 23 The division of the page according to case evidence is supported by significant contrasts in compositorial features. In column b, some of the non-Compositor D spellings which appear are: indeed (929), heere (934), pretty (938), choyse (974), and twenty (969), which was changed from the copy spelling twentie . Another non-Compositor D feature in column b is the apostrophe and the roman s in Bassanio's (949); the roman s is characteristic of only Compositor C. In column a, in the first line, is the contraction ith (862), which Compositor D never uses, but which Compositor C sets on occasion (Howard-Hill, 106). A few lines later two instances of mistris (876, 881) indicate that Compositor D has taken over. The last piece of type from case x appeared in line 873; so the break must occur somewhere in these four lines. The end of Shylock's speech (875) seems to be a good spot to pinpoint the change in compositors. The reason Howard-Hill had assigned this whole page to Compositor D was five indented flow-overs. Four of these indented flow-overs occur in the z-case portion of column a and were set by Compositor D. The fifth occurs in column b (932), but an indented flow-over, by itself, is insufficient evidence of Compositor D. One final, interesting feature on this page is that the last line in column b is repeated at the top of F2. Although this repetition could be the fault of one compositor, it might be further evidence that the compositor of F1 v b could be different from the compositor of F2. Thus, a degree of normalcy is established in quire P. Compositors C and D set a page each in the first three formes, and then Compositor B joined in so that three compositors with three cases shared the work of setting each of the last three formes. Compositor D set P1-1 v a (after line 875), and P2-3 v , and was the only person to use the z-case in the Folio. Generally, I found these 'problem' quires to be more regular than Howard-Hill thought. Nevertheless, the compositors were clearly attempting to develop a method that could take advantage of the extra compositor and case that became available during the course of the printing of the Comedies.

      <field name="heading_text">Richardson's Revisions of Clarissa in the Third and Fourth Editions by Shirley Van Marter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since so many pages of text were added to Clarissa in the third edition, it has generally been assumed that the third, or a conflation of the third and fourth editions, represents most fully Samuel Richardson's final intentions. Editors have accepted this assumption, and for very good reasons. The novel published for the third time in 1751 is not only a whole volume longer than the one that readers first encountered in 1747-48. It also differs in tone and appearance from the second version, dated 1749. The author's claim, of course, that the third edition restored many of the letters and passages he had deleted from his original manuscript contributed to the preeminence of that edition from 1751 to our own time. And one only has to scan the separate volume, Letters and Passages Restored from the Original Manuscripts of the History of Clarissa , which Richardson published simultaneously with the third edition, "for the Sake of doing Justice to the Purchasers of the Two First Editions of that Work," 1 to discover how attentively he retouched his finest novel. In an earlier article 2 I explored the range and variety of Richardson's revisions in the second edition, in search of firmer and more precise ground than has been available in discussions of the problem thus far. Having also collated the third and fourth editions with the first two (Volumes V-VIII of the third edition were collated directly with Volumes V-VII of the first, since the second edition consists of only the first four volumes), I now want to present my discoveries, relating them to some of the pivotal questions upon which certain critical controversies have recently turned. The first significant challenge to the privileged status of the third edition was mounted only in recent years by Kinkead-Weekes, in a suggestive article entitled " Clarissa Restored?" 3 His argument turns, not on the question of whether the third edition is negligently printed or carelessly revised, but on whether the passages and letters added to the novel in 1751 were in fact true "restorations," as Richardson claimed, or whether they were newly written to counteract some serious misreadings that Richardson observed in his contemporary audience. Kinkead-Weekes argues that Richardson's efforts to blacken the character of Lovelace, and to engage in more explicit moralizing, make the third edition "cruder and clumsier" than the first. Moreover, he claims, this may be "the earliest example of the effect upon a novel of audience reactions in the course of publication." 4 For these reasons then, he believes, there is a strong case for printing the first edition. His conclusion was in fact acted on in April, 1971, when the Rinehart Press published an abridged version of the first edition, edited by Philip Stevick. In his Introduction, Mr. Stevick acknowledges his debt to Kinkead-Weekes and he concludes, as his predecessor did, that "the third edition is, although more carefully written, more coarse and heavy-handed in its enlistment of our sympathies." 5 I am not primarily interested in this present article in either affirming or refuting the thesis advanced by Kinkead-Weekes or Stevick. There are many other problems germane to the full sweep of Richardson's changes, embracing several kinds of data, which must first be examined. In brief, Volumes I-IV, to which the second edition is limited, were patiently reworked, not only by several large addenda, but also by the systematic alteration of thousands of minute and subtle points as well, covering many aspects of the novel from the very minor to the very significant, ranging in quality from indifferent to excellent, and reflecting in myriad ways both Richardson's unique gifts and his peculiar weaknesses as a craftsman. When taken as a part of the total effort he made at that time, the changes we can pinpoint with any certainty as arising from the objections of a hostile, critical audience are an extremely small proportion of the author's complete endeavor. It may still be that the first edition should be printed, but perhaps not for the reasons that have been alleged. As I did in my discussion of the second edition, I will again present a varied sampling of Richardson's changes, emphasizing those which most fundamentally affect certain features of Clarissa , such as character, narrative method, style, etc., those which continue patterns begun in the second edition (or even when the novel was in manuscript form), those which have been the subject of critical dispute, and those which most effectively illustrate Richardson's artistic goals and intentions. With all the relevant evidence in hand, one can then try to offer solutions to a cluster of interesting problems.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Richardson left two helpful indications of at least his major addenda to the third edition. One is the separate volume Letters and Passages Restored , in which he arranged the "restored" items chronologically as a handy collection for readers who owned the shorter novel. Every passage printed in this volume is in fact found in the version of Clarissa that reached booksellers in 1751. The second indication employs a device he worked out to flag "restored" passages visually in the margin of each page affected in the third edition. He announced his plans to use this device in a letter to David Graham, dated May 3, 1750: "I intend to restore a few Letters, and not a few Passages in different Places of the Work long as it already is (by particular Desire) and shall distinguish the Additions by turn'd Full Points , as we call them, or Dots, in the Manner of turn'd Commas." 6 Unlike what we might expect, however, these two records are not identical. In Letters and Passages Restored , Richardson collects 127 separate passages, 27 from the second edition, the remainder from the third. With his dotting technique he identifies 168 items, including all of the 127 gathered in the supplementary volume. Both records are least useful in indicating deletions; they do note some of the most significant passages that are reworked, but their greatest value is in identifying the major additions to the novel. The smallest unit that Richardson marks is at least one printed line of text, but he certainly does not record all his changes of this magnitude, for he actually made 739 revisions of one printed line or more: 375 in the second edition, 364 new ones in the third. Another clue to how many significant revisions he omits from Letters and Passages Restored , or fails to dot in the third edition, is provided by a comparison of these two records with his hand-written memorandum listing some of his revisions in the second edition. 7 Of the 102 "most material changes" he noted in 1749 (all of which are incorporated into the third edition), only 27 are selected for Letters and Passages Restored . Only 1 of the 19 listed "Alterations," none of the 6 "Omissions," only 7 of the 22 "Notes added," and 6 of the 25 "Additions" are found in the supplementary volume, although all 5 "Insertions" are included, 5 of the 10 "Alterations and Additions," and most of the miscellaneous items. And of course the thousands of smaller substantive changes (in isolated words or short phrases), that cumulatively alter the general quality of the text, are not singled out by any of these records. In certain important respects, those who purchased Letters and Passages Restored to supplement their copy of the first edition did not have a text very close to the one newly printed in 1751. What they did gain was 127 of Richardson's longest addenda and revisions. They could therefore talk intelligently about the major new scenes or letters, but they possessed very little evidence of how thoroughly he reshaped his masterpiece in numerous other important ways. As had been true previously in 1749, Volumes III and IV again seem to have taxed Richardson the most, perhaps because these two volumes present the delicate circumstance of Clarissa residing under the same roof with Lovelace, first at St. Albans, later in London. Furthermore, they pose interpretive problems, for they are also the first ones in which Lovelace's point of view becomes prominent as a controlling narrative principle. An attentive reader is expected to take this into account, and to supplement and correct Clarissa's and Anna's points of view with clues from Lovelace's letters and actions. In short, a reader's moral and intellectual sensitivities are continually challenged, for amid the lively flux of this long novel, he needs to make a host of carefully balanced judgments with respect to a congeries of elusive matters: of propriety in unusual conditions; of artifice and responsibility amid a tangled web of snares; of the distinction between liking and love; of hopes sprung from limited knowledge. To Richardson's dismay, not all readers succeeded in doing this. Indeed, some even censored the heroine for not marrying Lovelace at once, believing that she was responsible for the delay out of concern for the mere niceties of social behavior. These readers may have been swayed by Anna Howe's vigorous argument that Clarissa should raise the question of marriage herself, even if Lovelace didn't. To offset this reading, Richardson had introduced several changes in the second edition, including 18 new footnotes that urge readers to be more attentive to Lovelace's artfulness and to Clarissa's true sense of propriety. He did not, in 1751, expand this practice of using omniscient footnotes, 8 but he did attempt several refinements of Clarissa's delicate moral sense. He struck out one pointed admission by her: "I could not, all at once, act as if I thought all punctilio was at an end . I was unwilling to suppose it was so soon" (2nd ed., III, 96). Another change adds a tribute, by Lovelace himself, to Clarissa's delicacy as something precious: But never, I believe, was there so true, so delicate a modesty in the human mind as in that of this Lady. And this has been my security all along; and, in spite of Miss Howe's advice to her, will be so still since, if her Delicacy be a fault, she can no more overcome it than I can my aversion to Matrimony. Habit, habit, Jack, seest thou not? may subject us both to weaknesses. And should she not have charity for me, as I have for her? (3rd ed., IV, 331). A third revision greatly expands a dialogue between Lovelace and Clarissa shortly after their arrival at St. Albans. This twelve-page insertion (3rd ed., III, 132-144) enters that section of the novel in which Clarissa "selects" new quarters, while Lovelace manipulates the conversation so that she will choose London. This point in the action gave Richardson great concern, for he had already introduced 7 footnotes in 1749 to stress Clarissa's limited state of knowledge, and to show that her propriety renders her vulnerable to Lovelace's scheme to avoid proposing marriage. A much shorter new addition in the same volume also shows how her sense of decorum is being taxed: "He now does nothing but talk of the Ceremony ; but not indeed of the Day . I don't want him to urge that—But I wonder he does not" (3rd ed., III, 313). Several minor changes are designed to purify Clarissa of unbecoming artifice, again continuing a pattern begun in the second edition. Since this is one of a handful of examples that he revised twice, I quote all three versions: I am far from being well: Yet must I make myself worse than I am, preparative to the suspension I hope to obtain of the menaced evil of Wednesday next (1st ed., II, 261). I am really ill. And shall make the worst of my indisposition, and not the best (as I used to do, for fear of making my friends uneasy) in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next (2nd ed., II, 259). I am really ill. I was used to make the best of any little accidents that befell me, for fear of makeing my then affectionate friends uneasy: But now I shall make the worst of my indisposition, in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next (3rd ed., II, 271). The most significant of these three versions clearly is the second one, for it enhances the heroine by recasting her motivation. Although it was not Richardson's general practice to revise a revision, he went on to amplify the passage in 1751, but with no important alteration in content. A new paragraph excuses Clarissa's forbidden correspondence with Anna Howe, reinforcing some touches attempted in the second edition. Since their contact must be kept alive if the established story line is to continue, the narrative challenge is how to accomplish this without showing Clarissa willfully disobeying Mrs. Howe's injunctions: I see with great regret, that your Mamma is still immoveably bent against our correspondence. What shall I do about it?—It goes against me to continue it, or to wish you to favour me with returns.—Yet I have so managed my matters, that I have no friend but you to advise with. It is enough to make one indeed wish to be married to this man, tho' a man of errors; as he has worthy Relations of my own Sex; and I should have some friends, I hope:—And having some , I might have more —For as money is said to encrease money, so does the countenance of persons of character encrease friends: While the destitute must be destitute.—It goes against my heart to beg of you to discontinue corresponding with me; and yet it is against my conscience to carry it on against parental prohibition. But I dare not use all the arguments against it that I could use—And why?—For fear I should convince you; and you should reject me, as the rest of my friends have done. I leave therefore the determination of this point upon you.—I am not, I find, to be trusted with it. But be mine all the fault, and all the punishment, if it be punishable—And certainly it must, when it can be the cause of those over-lively sentences wherewith you conclude the Letter I have before me, and which I must no farther animadvert upon, because you forbid me to be so (3rd ed., III, 273). This avoids pitting the heroine in direct opposition to Mrs. Howe, for it shifts the responsibility for the decision to Anna even though Clarissa takes all the fault upon herself. It mainly underscores Clarissa's lonely isolation, letting that poignant fact speak for itself as a persuasive advocate for her desire to stay in touch with Anna. A less successful attempt to excuse this correspondence is found in Clarissa's letter to Anna of Sunday Night (April 16). Richardson fashioned new opening lines for his heroine, but they show her engaging in the kind of sophistry critics have occasionally attacked: "I may send to you, altho' you are forbid to write to me; may I not?—For that is not a cor-respondence (Is it?) where Letters are not answered" (3rd ed., III, 141). The question of artifice even colors Clarissa's scheme to mislead Lovelace, shortly before her death, by writing to him ambiguously about her "Father's house." She tells Belford that Lovelace will seek her out in two or three days "in revenge for what he will think a deceit." In the third edition, Richardson adds several brief qualifications to exonerate her action. She is shown saying it "is not I hope a wicked one" (3rd ed., VII, 251); a few lines later she explains that her scheme "was done in a hurry of spirits," (3rd ed., VII, 251); and still later she adds: "I hope (repeated she) that it is a pardonable artifice. But I am afraid it is not strictly right" (3rd ed., VII, 252). Quite a different problem that Richardson sought to resolve in 1751 was the precise quality of Clarissa's feeling for Lovelace. When his novel was in manuscript form the author stated that he fully intended Clarissa to be in love with Lovelace, but that he wanted to establish this fact through someone other than herself. He told Aaron Hill on October 29, 1746: "As to Clarissa's being in downright Love, I must acknowledge, that I rather chose to have it imputed to her, (his too well-known Character consider'd) by her penetrating Friend, (and then a Reader will be ready enough to believe it, the more ready, for her not owning it, or being blind to it herself) than to think her self that she is." 9 And again, in a letter to Hill dated January 26, 1747: "I must still say, that I would not have Clarissa in Love, at setting out: And that I intended the Passion should be inspired and grow, unknown to herself, and be more obvious, for a good while, to every-body than to herself; and when it became glowing, that it should be owing more to unreasonable Opposition, than to the Merits of the Man." 10 There is no ambiguity here about the nature and development of the passion Richardson selected: Clarissa would feel some initial preference for Lovelace in contrast to her profound distaste for Solmes, and to her objection to Wyerly (an earlier suitor), on other grounds. Her first favorable feelings for Lovelace could plausibly become a strong love, if only he would treat her as she deserved. Accordingly, the middle volumes offer glimpses of how Clarissa might respond to a reformed Lovelace, interspersed with persistent evidence of her dislike for his unreformed character. Whatever may be the intricacy Richardson desired in her emotion toward Lovelace, he seems never to have anticipated that it would become the basis for further criticism of her. Some readers accused her of being cold and distant to Lovelace, particularly in their meetings at St. Albans. Richardson, obviously annoyed by this reaction, inserted a short passage in his Postscript to the third edition qualifying her attitude as much less serious than love: "Several persons have censured the Heroine as too cold in her love, too haughty, and even sometimes provoking. But we may presume to say, that this objection has arisen from want of attention to the Story, to the Character of Clarissa, and to her particular Situation. It was not intended that she should be in Love , but in Liking only, if that expression may be admitted" (3rd ed., VIII, 290). Although several lines had been already touched up in the second edition, perhaps to cope with this problem, there are still more changes in 1751. Three of them occur in Volume IV, after Lovelace takes Ipecacuanha to test Clarissa's affection for him. Two new speeches indicate his frame of mind. Part of one is quoted here: "She loves me. The Ipecacuanha contrivance convinces me, that she loves me. Where there is Love, there must be confidence, or a desire of having reason to confide, Generosity, founded on my supposed generosity, has taken hold of her heart. Shall I not now see (since I must be for ever unhappy, if I marry her, and leave any trial unessayed) what I can make of her Love, and her newly-raised confidence?" (3rd ed., IV, 304). 11 A new line is invented for Clarissa right after the same incident. It does not at all support Lovelace's emphatic conclusions, for it carefully avoids the word "love," and it only admits an unrealized possibility: "'Tis true, I have owned more than once, that I could have liked Mr. Lovelace above all men" (3rd ed., IV, 279). A longer insertion in Clarissa's letter to Anna of May 27 again shows her admitting an earlier inclination toward Lovelace, but now she evaluates her attachment as a serious shortcoming: . . . let me tell you a secret which I have but very lately found out upon self-examination, altho' you seem to have made the discovery long ago; That had not my foolish eye been too much attached, I had not taken the pains to attempt, so officiously as I did, the prevention of mischief between him and some of my family, which first induced the correspondence between us, and was the occasion of bringing the apprehended mischief with double weight upon himself. My vanity and conceit, as far as I know, might have part in the inconsiderate measure: For it does not look as if I thought myself more capable of obviating difficulties, than anybody else of my family? But you must not, my dear, suppose my heart to be still a confederate with my eye. That deluded eye now clearly sees its fault, and the misled heart despises it for it . . . (3rd ed., IV, 57-59). One of Richardson's best artistic gifts is his mastery of suspense, exploiting the fact that plausible human hopes are kindled whenever limited knowledge leads a character or the reader to interpret a new action favorably, as a sign of something better to come. Among Richardson's many efforts to perfect his craft in 1751, he created several revisions that prolong suspense by heightening Clarissa's expectations for good fortune before her hopes are reversed. Some of these occur in Volume I when a confrontation with her family is developed and its outcome delayed until the following morning. Four separate changes are made in this incident. The first transforms Clarissa's proposals to her brother into a completely separate letter (3rd ed., I, 298); the second begs Arabella's assistance in this matter (3rd ed., I, 299); the third prolongs the incident by having Arabella deliver the proposals to her brother, and then announce to Clarissa that the family will not act upon them until the next day (3rd ed., I, 299-300); the fourth is a new eight-page letter from Clarissa to Anna, dated Tuesday, March 21, the night before the family council, revealing her hopes that the Harlowes will act in her interest. Although the original version in the first two editions is reasonably good, the new one is even better, for it transmutes a sketchy scene into something more developed, dramatically charged to make us anxious witnesses of the evil engulfing Clarissa at the moment. This kind of longer revision shows Richardson at his best, controlling incident, character and dialogue with the measured skill that is his enviable trademark. Three new passages in later volumes also show Clarissa more hopeful that events will favor her. One change is in the opening to her letter of Friday, May 19, in which she confesses to Anna, "I would not, if I could help it, be so continually brooding over the dark and gloomy face of my condition [All nature, you know, my dear, and every-thing in it, has a bright and a gloomy side] as to be thought unable to enjoy a more hopeful prospect. . . . Let me tell you then, my dear, that I have known four-and-twenty hours together not unhappy ones, my situation considered" (3rd ed., IV, 147). This passage introduces an even larger addition (3rd ed., IV, 148-150) which illustrates how effectively Clarissa has been deceived by a contrived conversation between Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair and Sally Martin. The revision makes it more probable that Clarissa in this mood would consent to accompany Lovelace to a performance of Venice Preserved , an incident which is necessary to the plot if her letters from Anna are to be found and copied without her knowledge. A third insertion shows her anticipating that Capt. Tomlinson (whom she does not know is Lovelace's agent) will reunite her with her family: "It cannot but yield me some pleasure, hardly as I have sometimes thought of the people of the house, that such a good man, as Captain Tomlinson, had spoken well of them, upon enquiry. And here I stop a minute, my dear, to receive, in fancy, your kind congratulation. My next, I hope, will confirm my present, and open still more agreeable prospects . . ." (3rd ed., IV, 319-320). In all three cases our own privileged state of greater knowledge makes us aware that her hopes are illusory, and that her disappointment will be keener accordingly. Richardson also altered Clarissa's reaction to her father's curse. Numerous small revisions accentuate the cruelty of the curse and stress its impact on her. 12 All but one occur in Volume VI after she has been raped and permanently isolated from her family. The one exception is an editorial footnote, added to Volume III, stressing Clarissa's state of mind when she first received news of the curse: "Mr. Lovelace in his next Letter tells his friend how extremely ill the Lady was; recovering from fits to fall into stronger fits, and nobody expecting her life. She had not, he says, acquainted Miss Howe, how very ill she was. In p. 273 she tells Miss Howe, that her motives for suspending were not merely ceremonious ones " (3rd ed., III, 267). Other revisions play down Clarissa's hope that the curse will be revoked. They stress most of all her wish for forgiveness and her hope for a blessing. This passage, in its original and revised versions, is typical: I shall not be easy, till I can procure the revocation of that dreadful curse; and, if possible, a last forgiveness" (1st ed., VI, 42). I shall not be easy, till I can obtain a last Forgiveness" (3rd ed., VI, 139). When the curse is mentioned, Clarissa eagerly seeks to have it removed, as much for her father's sake as for her own: But what shall I do, if my father cannot be prevailed upon to recal his grievous malediction?—Of all the very heavy evils wherewith I have been afflicted, this is now the heaviest; for I can neither live nor die under it (1st ed., VI, 35). But what shall I do, if my Father cannot be prevailed upon to recal his Malediction? O my dear Mrs. Norton, what a weight must a Father's Curse have upon a heart so apprehensive as mine!—Did I think I should ever have a Father's Curse to deprecate? And yet, only that the temporary part of it is so terribly fulfilled, or I should be as earnest for its recall, for my Father's sake, as for my own! (3rd ed., VI, 131). The new stress on Mr. Harlowe's guilt is seen even more clearly in this new comment by Anna Howe, and seems to be part of several other new revisions to darken the Harlowes: I am concern'd to find, that your father's rash wish affects you so much as it does. Upon my word, my dear, your mind is weaken'd grievously. You must not, indeed you must not, desert yourself. The penitence you talk of—(1st ed., VI, 124). I am concerned to find, that your Father's inhuman curse affects you so much as it does. Yet you are a noble Creature, to put it, as you put it—I hope you are indeed more solicitous to get it revoked for their sakes than for your own (3rd ed., VI, 234). Of the 67 larger revisions centering on Clarissa in 1751, 20 are of one kind: new statements eulogizing her character and actions. Most of these testimonials come after her death, especially in Anna's letter XLIX which received 14 new insertions, 13 but there are also new tributes by Lovelace (3rd ed., IV, 224, 324; V, 268; VI, 311-313); by Belford (VIII, 95); and by Morden (VIII, 164-165). This failure of invention, in Anna's letter in particular, has been duly criticized more than once. 14 Perhaps the most telling comment, by an anonymous critic in 1754, reveals that Richardson's proliferation of praise was no more persuasive with his contemporaries than with us: "The division of her time, and her diary had been better omitted: all such things detract from the nature and simplicity of a character." 15 Only once in 1751 does Richardson delete material in praise of his heroine. The words are by Clarissa herself, after her escape from Lovelace: "High resolution, a courage I never knew before; a settled, not a rash courage; and such a command of my passions—I can only say, I know not how I came by such an uncommon elevation of mind, if it were not given me in answer to my earnest prayers to Heaven for such a command of myself, before I entered into the horrid company" (1st ed., VI, 241). In general, Richardson's renewed efforts to improve his protagonist in 1751 reinforce certain patterns already begun in the second edition. Although he no longer considered her delicacy a major problem, he was still drawn to some passages that explicitly take up the matter. With several more refinements he reduced the grounds for charging her with unflattering artifice and deceit. He apparently sought at this time to portray her turning more consciously toward spiritual comfort, a repentant fully aware of the snares of the world. Clarissa introduces further moral reflections, and excessively detailed praise is heaped upon her. Indeed, Anna's eulogy (VIII, Letter XLIX) is curiously conceived, for it undermines his efforts to elevate her above purely human concerns. Although his heroine occupied much of Richardson's attention, his rake is not neglected in 1751. About one-third of the 364 revisions (of one printed line or more) that are new to the third edition concern the intricate and shifting relationships between Lovelace and Clarissa. While the very obvious blackening of Lovelace in 1749 by means of 18 new omniscient footnotes does not increase now, other revisions in the third edition show him plotting new schemes, or making old ones more explicit. Nonetheless, Richardson grafts his changes very tightly onto the framework of his text, and it is thus difficult, from internal evidence alone, to sort out newly written addenda from those invented much earlier as parts of Richardson's conception of Lovelace right from the beginning. Several additions to the heavily-revised third volume disclose Lovelace devising ways to keep Clarissa in his power. The following passage, for example, establishes his plan to trick her to London by pretending to reform: Well, Jack, thou seest it is high time to change my measures. I must run into the Pious a little faster than I had designed. What a sad thing would it be, were I, after all, to lose her person, as well as her opinion! The only time that further acquaintance, and no blow struck, nor suspicion given, ever lessened me in a Lady's favour!—A cursed mortification!—'Tis certain I can have no pretence for holding her, if she will go.—No such thing as force to be used, or so much as hinted at: Lord send us safe at London!—That's all I have for it now: And yet it must be the least part of my speech (3rd ed., III, 73-74). Once they are established in London, Lovelace spells out in added lines the role he has destined for Dorcas: And, among the rest, who dost thou think is to be her maid-servant?—Deb. Butler. Ah, Lovelace! And Ah, Belford! It can't be otherwise. But what doest think Deb's Name is to be?—Why, Dorcas, Dorcas Wykes. And won't it be admirable, if either thro' fear, fright, or good liking, we can get my Beloved to accept of Dorcas Wykes for a bedfellow? (3rd ed., III, 284). Two new paragraphs identify Lovelace's motives more pointedly. They stand as proof that Clarissa's decorum is not the only cause of Lovelace's conduct, but that revenge on the Harlowes, and his own pride, also drive him onward, goaded by the fallen women at Mrs. Sinclair's: It would be a miracle, as thou sayst, if this Lady can save herself—And having gone so far, how can I recede?—Then my Revenge upon the Harlowes!—To have run away with a Daughter of theirs, to make her a Lovelace—To make her one of a family so superior to her own, what a Triumph, as I have heretofore observed, to them !—But to run away with her, and to bring her to my lure in the other light, what a mortification of their pride! What a gratification of my own! Then these women are continually at me. These women, who, before my whole soul and faculties were absorbed in the Love of this single charmer, used always to oblige me with the flower and first fruits of their garden! Indeed, indeed, my Goddess should not have chosen this London Widow's—But I dare say, if I had , she would not . . .! (3rd ed., III, 284-285). A three-page insert outlines with more detail Lovelace's pretense to secure and furnish Mrs. Fretchville's house for Clarissa (III, 314-316); and a new paragraph in the next volume, through Lovelace's point of view, lets us glimpse him evading a proposal: I'll tell thee beforehand, how it will be with my Charmer in this case—She will be about it, and about it, several times: But I will not understand her: At last, after half a dozen hem—ings, she will be obliged to speak out— I think, Mr. Lovelace—I think, Sir—I think you were saying some days ago —Still I will be all silence—her eyes fixed upon my shoe-buckles, as I sit over-against her—Ladies, when put to it thus, always admire a man's shoe-buckles, or perhaps some particular beauties in the carpet. I think you said, that Mrs. Fretchville —Then a crystal tear trickles down each crimson cheek, vexed to have her virgin pride so little assisted. But, come, my meaning dear, cry I to myself, remember what I have suffered for thee, and what I have suffered by thee! Thy tearful pausings shall not be helped out by me. Speak out, Love!—O the sweet confusion! Can I rob myself of so many conflicting beauties by the precipitate charmer-pitying folly, by which a politer man [Thou knowest , Lovely, that I am no polite man!] betrayed by his own tenderness, and unused to female tears, would have been overcome? I will feign an irresolution of mind on the occasion, that she may not quite abhor me—that her reflections on the scene in my absence may bring to her remembrance some beauties in my part of it: An irresolution that will be owing to awe, to reverence, to profound veneration; and that will have more eloquence in it, than words can have. Speak out then, Love, and spare not (3rd ed., IV, 108-109). Lovelace's instructions to his fellow rakes were expanded at length in the second edition. In 1751 another small insertion discloses the kind of calculating art he will use throughout his interview with them (3rd ed., III, 321-322), and a very long addition presents him exulting in the success of his story about Mrs. Fretchville's house (3rd ed., III, 327-328). A new paragraph in his Letter XXXI to Belford hints at his plan to intercept Anna's letters: "It is easy for me to perceive, that my Charmer is more sullen when she receives, and has perused, a Letter from that vixen, than at other times. But as the sweet Maid shews, even then, more of passive grief , than of active spirit , I hope she is rather lamenting than plotting. And indeed for what now should she plot? when I am become a reformed man, and am hourly improving in my morals?—Nevertheless I must contrive some way or other to get at their correspondence—Only to see the turn of it; that's all (3rd ed., III, 161). The most elaborate scheme of all is disclosed in Letter XLII, added to the third edition (IV, 252-261). This sketches Lovelace's plan to rape Anna, Mrs. Howe and their maid during a projected trip to the Isle of Wight. The plan is farfetched and does little to enhance the novel, though it may have been intended to show Lovelace's debased condition. It certainly could not have been written in response to criticism vented after publication, because it was part of the original manuscript. Eaves and Kimpel analyze the evidence for this (from 1746 or 1747) in lines from Sarah Westcomb recommending that this letter be cut from the manuscript. 16 A comment by the "editor" in the first edition also explains why the scene was not included when the novel was first printed (IV, 196). An inventive dialogue between Love and Conscience is added only 53 pages before the rape (3rd ed., V, 235-238). Love loses out and Conscience refuses to plead for Clarissa, preparing the way for the catastrophe which follows. Kinkead-Weekes argues that this passage is "designed to drive home his [Lovelace's] heartlessness in dramatic terms," 17 and he uses it, through contrast with the first edition, as evidence of the harder line Richardson took in 1751. I find, on the contrary, that the passage is utterly consistent with Richardson's complex presentation of his villain prior to the rape. Lovelace's mood is playful, and the gross realism of what he is plotting is partially hidden by his imaginative, mock-heroic point of view during the dialogue. His periodic hesitancy to continue with his plot ("I don't know what it is, that gives a check to my revenge, whenever I meditate treason against so sovereign a virtue.") nourishes our hope for his genuine reform, and it helps distract us until the news of the rape bursts out with sudden surprise. The passage perfectly embodies, in aesthetic terms, Richardson's moral thesis that evil hidden under a glittering surface is harmful even to the most virtuous, and thus should be completely avoided. Four other additions amplify Lovelace's attitude toward religion and Scripture. Together they display quite a range of irreverence, cruelty, shrewd observation about religious practices, and wisdom about human nature, offering another sample of the uniquely mixed good and evil qualities typical of Lovelace. In the first edition, he comments upon a Scriptural passage, candidly noting how useful the Bible can be for defrauding pious believers: "O what a fine coat and cloak for an hypocrite will a text of Scripture, properly applied, make at any time in the eye of the pious! How easily are the good folks taken in!" (3rd ed., IV, 290). The second occurs after Lovelace accompanies Clarissa to services at St. Paul's. It reveals the most radical diversity in his character, as it unfolds progressively worse aspects in him. But even here Lovelace is a moral spokesman for the author when he pays tribute to good Dr. Lewen, and when he comments upon contemporary religious services, remarking the exaggerated importance of the preacher: Her wishes, from my attentive behaviour, when with her at St. Paul's, that I would often accompany her to the Divine Service, were gently intimated, and as readily engaged for. I assured her, that I ever had respected the Clergy in a body; and some individuals of them (her Dr. Lewen for one) highly: And that were not going to church an act of Religion, I thought it [as I told thee once] a most agreeable sight to see Rich and Poor, all of a company , as I might say, assembled once a week in one place, and each in his or her best attire, to worship the God that made them. Nor could it be a hardship upon a man liberally educated, to make one on so solemn an occasion, and to hear the harangue of a man of Letters (tho' far from being the principal part of the service, as it is too generally looked upon to be) whose studies having taken a different turn from his own, he must always have something new to say. She shook her head, and repeated the word New : But looked as if willing to be satisfied for the present with this answer. To be sure, Jack, she means to do great despight to his Satanic Majesty in her hopes of reforming me. No wonder therefore if he exerts himself to prevent her, and to be revenged—But how came this in?—I am ever of party against myself.—One day, I fansy, I shall hate myself on recollecting what I am about at this instant. But I must stay till then. We must all of us do something to repent of (3rd ed., IV, 322-323). The third addition occurs 4 weeks after the rape. It ridicules the marriage ceremony as so much "Legerdemain" (3rd ed., VI, 230), and the final addition shows him debauching a pious devotée in Paris, who tried to convert him (3rd ed., VI, 361). Two other small revisions affect certain traits, already discussed, of Lovelace's character. A short passage, added to Volume II, shows his eloquent resentment when he learns from Clarissa that her brother has a servant spy upon her movements: "O my beloved creature!—But are not your very excuses confessions of excuses inexcusable? I know not what I write!— That servant in your way! By the great God of heaven, that servant was not, dared not, could not be in your way!—Curse upon the cool caution that is pleaded to deprive me of an expectation so transporting!" (3rd ed., II, 122). This insertion is quite appropriate to its context early in the novel, when Richardson wants to intensify readers' hatred of James Harlowe. Through contrast with James, Lovelace easily seems more appealing during this stage of the action, masking his own viciousness. By Volume VI, however, Richardson eliminates lines that stress Lovelace's remorse for his crime. The original and revised versions are: "I am not asham'd to do justice to Miss Harlowe's merit in words, altho' I will confess, that I ought to blush that I have done it so little in deeds" (1st ed., VI, 113). "I am not asham'd to do justice to Miss Harlowe's merit" (3rd ed., VI, 221). Although this deletion serves the author's plan to detach us from any lingering pity for his villain, it is, as an excision, rare among his changes in 1751, for in that year Richardson's made only 21 deletions of at least one printed line, 18 and many of them are lines of verse, footnotes, contemporary references no longer needed, or purely mechanical information rendered obsolete by further revisions. Leaving aside the changes affecting Clarissa and Lovelace, it is clear that many of the larger substantive revisions in 1751 deal with major supporting characters, and a larger proportion of them do so than is true of the second edition. This time the Harlowe family, who drew considerable attention in 1749, are altered only in minor ways, but Anna Howe, Belford, Hickman, Brand and others become more prominent in the revisions. This is not totally surprising, for it reflects the greater importance of these other supporting characters in the second half of the novel, and Volumes V-VII had not been revised in 1749. The only example I shall quote concerning the Harlowes is a brief deletion. Like most of the changes affecting them two years earlier, it is evidence of Richardson's sustained care to harden their image, for it removes a suggestion that the heroine's family would have accepted her eventually. The deletion is from Belford's letter to Lovelace of Friday, Sept. 22: As to the family at Harlowe-Place, I have most affecting letters from Colonel Morden relating to their grief and distress. You, to whom the occasion is owing, do well to rejoice in their compunction: But, as one well observes, Averse as they were to you, they must and they would have been reconciled in time, had you done her justice (1st ed., VII, 331). As to the family at Harlowe-Place, I have most affecting Letters from Colonel Morden relating to their grief and compunction. But are you, to whom the occasion is owing, entitled to rejoice in their distress? (3rd ed., VIII, 138). Anna's multiple persuasive functions are again expanded. Additions to her letter of Tuesday, April 18 further expose the stubbornness of the Harlowe family; she now identifies Clarissa's feeling for Lovelace as love, and she speculates upon Lovelace's behavior after marriage (3rd ed., III, 172-173); she also implicates Antony Harlowe in the plot to keep Anna from sending money to Clarissa, and she urges her friend to abandon all hopes of reconciliation with her family and to leave for London with Lovelace (3rd ed., III, 175-176). Other new comments by her build up false hopes for Lovelace's conversion (3rd ed., IV, 81-82). Since she seems to know Lovelace for what he is in this passage ("a specious deceiver"), and since we value her judgment as sound in regard to the Harlowe family, Richardson uses her authority to continue raising false expectations for Lovelace's reformation. Anna is in no way transformed in 1751; she is simply utilized, over again, to assist Lovelace unwittingly, to keep readers off balance with respect to his essential character, and to mitigate Clarissa's responsibility for certain fateful decisions. Seven revisions in 1751 focus on Anna's suitor Hickman. In the second edition, Richardson had deleted one small, but important passage that showed his morally good man to be stuffy and sheepish (1st ed., I, 174). More extensive changes are made now. The most effective adds two new letters (XXI, XXII) at a critical point early in the novel (3rd ed., II, 133-137) to exhibit Hickman's true worth, immediately after a very derogatory report by Anna. Her account of Hickman primping and preening (Letter XX), before he drove her and Mrs. Howe to their dying cousin Larkin's house, makes him appear silly and foppish. Through her eyes, Hickman seems in the first and second editions to be a man we cannot seriously respect, and it is extremely difficult to resist accepting her opinion, for we have no independent evidence of his true character as a check on her witty version of the day's events. To balance her prejudicial description, the two new letters (between Hickman and Mrs. Howe) discuss the same event. We know these were specifically designed to offset criticism the novelist received about Hickman's character, because Richardson advertises this particular revision in his new Postscript (3rd ed., VIII, 292-295). After first attempting to refute certain charges (the "meekness" and "tameness" of Hickman), the author announces: Two Letters, however, by way of accommodation, are inserted in this edition, which perhaps will give Mr. Hickman's character some heightening with such Ladies, as love spirit in a man; and had rather suffer by it, than not meet with it.— Women, born to be controul'd, Stoop to the Forward and the Bold, Says Waller—and Lovelace too! (3rd ed., VIII, 294). The letters themselves are far more effective than Richardson's begrudging statement in the Postscript. The first, from Hickman, draws us directly into his mind, permitting an insight not granted earlier in the novel. Indeed, it is the only sustained view of Hickman's private thoughts throughout the eight volumes, and he comes alive as a man more sensible and sympathetic than we would ever have expected from Anna's humorous raillery. Mrs. Howe's reply to Hickman substantiates our new esteem for him because her own persona works in his favor: she understands her spirited daughter, but she also expresses mature respect for Hickman. Richardson need not have gone on public record in his Postscript as so nettled with his audience. Judging by the two letters he added, he clearly grasped the nature of the problem, and he possessed ample creative ability to cope with it. But his one novel revision could not, by itself, operate decisively, and he did not match it with others. None of the six other changes is as successful in remodeling Hickman. These additions merely elaborate the novel's framework as it already bears on Richardson's virtuous man, instead of altering it sufficiently to reshape a reader's encounter with him. In one case, the "editor" introduces new excerpts from Clarissa's letter to Anna: You assume, my dear, says she , your usual, and ever-agreeable Style, in what you write of the two Gentlemen, and how unaptly you think they have chosen; Mr. Hickman in addressing you; Mr. Lovelace me. But I am inclinable to believe, that with a view to happiness, however two mild tempers might agree, two high ones would make sad work of it, both at one time violent and unyielding. You two might indeed have raqueted the ball betwixt you, as you say. But Mr. Hickman, by his gentle manners, seems formed for you, if you go not too far with him. If you do, it would be a tameness in him to bear it, which would make a man more contemptible than Mr. Hickman can ever deserve to be made. Nor is it a disgrace for even a brave man, who knows what a woman is to vow to him afterwards , to be very obsequious beforehand . . . . Let me tell you, my dear, that Mr. Hickman is such a one, as would rather bear an affront from a Lady, than offer one to her. He had rather, I dare say, that she should have occasion to ask his pardon, than he hers (3rd ed., III, 272). Similar lines are added to Belford's description of his meeting with Hickman (3rd ed., VI, 402), and to Col. Morden's account of his encounter with him too (3rd ed., VIII, 169). New lines of ridicule are given to Lovelace (3rd ed., IV, 272-273; V, 137; VI, 314). Unfortunately, these other revisions contribute little to solving the complex aesthetic problems raised by Hickman's role. Instead of cutting to the root of these problems, as Richardson's finest revision does, his other efforts leave the problems intact, even reinforced. Many of the 13 revisions 19 affecting Belford elaborate his prime roles in the novel, especially his use as a moral commentator. He urges Lovelace to treat Clarissa honorably (3rd ed., III, 245; IV, 115); he recognizes the folly of holding false notions of honor (3rd ed., VIII, 153-154); he argues against the practice of keeping a mistress (3rd ed., VI, 322-323); he envisions the deathbed scenes of Tourville and Mowbray if they do not reform (3rd ed., VI, 325-326); and he is given increased opportunities for moral reflection about his own life (3rd ed., VIII, 62). The most interesting additions concerning Belford are three gracefully developed new hints in the closing volumes (3rd ed., VII, 284-285, 295-296; VIII, 152) of a romance between him and Miss Charlotte Montague, presumptive evidence for the permanence of his own reformation, in final contrast to Lovelace, the unregenerate libertine. These prepare the reader for a resolution Richardson had announced even in the "Conclusion" to his first edition. There he stated that Belford "having also kept in his mind some encouraging hints from Mr. Lovelace, . . . he besought that Nobleman's [Lord M.] Leave to make his addresses to Miss CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE" (1st ed., VII, 422-423). In 1751 this romance is set in motion by Lovelace's new note in his letter to Belford, Tuesday Afternoon, Aug. 29: Charlotte, in a whim of delicacy, is displeased that I send the inclosed Letter to you—That her hand-writing, forsooth! should go into the hands of a single man! There's encouragement for thee, Belford! This is a certain sign that thou may'st have her if thou wilt. And yet, till she had given me this unerring demonstration of her glancing towards thee, I could not have thought it. Indeed I have often in pleasantry told her, that I would bring such an affair to bear. But I never intended it; because she really is a dainty girl. And thou art such a clumsy fellow in thy person, that I should as soon have wished her a Rhinoceros for an husband, as thee. But, poor little dears! they must stay till their time's come! They won't have this man, and they won't have that man, from Seventeen to Twenty-five: But then, afraid, as the saying is, that God has forgot them , and finding their bloom departing, they are glad of whom they can get, and verify the Fable of the Parson and the Pears (3rd ed., VII, 284-285). Belford quickly takes the hint and pursues the suggestion in his reply, added into his letter of Wednesday Night, Aug. 30: As to what thou sayest of thy charming Cousin, let me know, if thou hast any meaning in it. I have not the vanity to think myself deserving of such a Lady as Miss Montague: And should not therefore care to expose myself to her scorn, and to thy derision. But were I assured I might avoid both these, I would soon acquaint thee, that I should think no pains nor assiduity too much to obtain a share in the good graces of such a Lady. But I knew thee too well to depend upon anything thou sayest on this subject. Thou lovest to make thy friends the object of ridicule to Ladies; and imaginest, from the vanity (and in this respect, I will say, littleness) of thine own heart, that thou shinest the brighter for the foil. Thus didst thou once play off the rough Mowbray with Miss Hatton, till the poor fellow knew not how to go either backward or forward (3rd ed., VII, 295-296). The final clue to Belford's eventual marriage appears in Volume VIII. Lovelace speaks: "Altho' I think, in a whimsical way, as now, I mentioned Charlotte to thee once before. Yet would I fain secure thy morals too, if matrimony will do it.—Let me see!—Now I have it" (3rd ed., VIII, 152). A very different kind of alteration raises puzzling questions about Charlotte and Patty Montague, as well as about Lovelace's reliability as a narrator, one of the central problems throughout much of the novel. The passage refers to the family gathering at Lord M's, convened to examine Lovelace about his treatment of Clarissa. Like its larger context, the newly developed paragraph reveals his disrespect for his family, and his habitual flippancy about grave matters: They perhaps, had they met with such another intrepid fellow as myself, who had first gained upon their affections, would not have made a rout as my Beloved has done, about such an affair as that we were assembled upon. Young Ladies, as I have observed on an hundred occasions, fear not half so much for themselves , as their Mothers do for them. But here the Girls were forced to put on grave airs, and to seem angry, because the Antiques made the matter of such high importance. Yet so lightly sat anger and fellow-feeling at their hearts, that they were forced to purse in their mouths, to suppress the smiles I now-and-then laid out for: While the Elders having had Roses (that is to say, Daughters) of their own, and knowing how fond men are of a Trifle, would have been very loth to have had them nipt in the bud, without saying, By your leave, Mrs. Rosebush, to the mother of it (3rd ed., VI, 214). Are the girls only pretending to be angry with Lovelace (as he claims), or do they seriously disapprove of his behavior? Clarissa testifies that they in particular have impeccable characters, and her view is supported by Anna Howe as well. This implies that Lovelace is misinterpreting his cousins' smiles—if indeed there are any at all. The revision mirrors the interpretive complexity of the larger world of this novel, where Lovelace's point of view must be constantly corrected by other signs, as it would have to be in real life. The third edition also contains new material on various minor characters. Two new letters from Rev. Elias Brand to his friend Mr. John Walton and to his patron John Harlowe are restored, adding 18 pages of text (3rd ed., VII, 380-398). They must be genuine restorations from an earlier manuscript, because an "editor's" note in the first edition attests to their previous existence (VII, 189). Further, one of Richardson's correspondents, Mr. John Channing, refers to them as early as 1748. 20 Mrs. Barbauld, the first editor of Richardson's papers, speculates too that Channing may have assisted Richardson with Brand's letters, 21 an opinion disputed by Eaves and Kimpel, who present convincing evidence that Richardson's own corrector for his press, Mr. R. Smith, was the more probable helper. 22 The two added letters develop Brand's foolish pedantry more elaborately, but they are tedious because of their excessive length. An artistically superior illustration of his pedantry is the one-paragraph insertion (3rd ed., VII, 290-291) that also entered the novel at this time. Other addenda give readers a short account of Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Bevis, and Miss Rawlins (3rd ed., V, 316-318), the three ladies at Hampstead Heath. Lovelace relates new histories about Miss Dorrington, Miss Savage, a young widow Sanderson, and Miss Sally Anderson. They are added to embellish his argument that women disappointed in love will do strange things (3rd ed., VI, 339-340). The longest moral histories, however, take up 15 pages in the Conclusion (3rd ed., VIII, 257-271), to chronicle the fall of Sally Martin and Polly Horton, young ladies who started out with superior abilities but who were corrupted by their foolish parents, and thus became easy victims of Lovelace's power at Madame Sinclair's. More than a hundred miscellaneous revisions, all one line or more, form no distinctive patterns. I will simply mention a few of the more important ones. Two footnotes provided contemporary readers with information appropriate to the period in which Clarissa is set, approximately 15 or 20 years earlier, i.e. 1730-35. 23 We learn that Lovelace wears "The fashionable Wigs at that time" (3rd ed., V, 72), and "The Seven o'clock Prayers at St. Dunstan's have been discontinued" (3rd ed., VI, 193). Belford's reference to "a small repast, at the Lebeck's Head in Chandos-Street" (1st ed., VI, 262) is cut, as is Col. Morden's allusion to Bishop Burnet (1st ed., VII, 398). An allusion to a French general is made less specific also: "So we read of a French general, in the reign of Harry the IVth (I forget his name, if it were not Mareschal Biron)" (1st ed., VI, 290); "So we read of a famous French general [I forget as well the reign of the prince, as the name of the man]" (3rd ed., VII, 15). A small alteration amplifies a discussion of narrative method. Belford's comment is developed briefly with an emphasis on Clarissa's psychological state at the time of writing: "How much more lively and affecting, for that reason, must her stile be, than all that can be read in the dry, narrative, unanimated stile of persons, relating difficulties and dangers surmounted!" (1st ed., VI, 336); "How much more lively and affecting, for that reason, must her style be; her mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty (the events then hidden in the womb of Fate) than the dry, narrative, unanimated style of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted" (3rd ed., VII, 73). Three more passages were altered from indirect to direct discourse (3rd ed., VII, 247, 308, 347) continuing an earlier pattern of revising, and two changes eliminate the "Roman style" (use of thy and thou ) from Belford's speech (3rd ed., VII, 174; VIII, 35). Three lines of verse are omitted (3rd ed., VIII, 241); other revisions shuffle lines and images used elsewhere in the novel (3rd ed., III, 146; IV, 109; VII, 225), and a note in the Conclusion about duelling (3rd ed., VIII, 276) anticipates a problem Richardson will explore more fully in Sir Charles Grandison . Mrs. Smith's servant is now named Katherine instead of Sarah; Mulciber is now called Lucifer. Clarissa leaves Anna and Hickman each 25 guineas (instead of 15) for mourning rings, and Lovelace sends Patrick McDonald (alias Capt. Tomlinson) 5 guineas instead of 3. Belford is left "a clear 1000 l. a year" by his uncle, not "500," and the nationality of Mrs. Sinclair's foolish surgeon is stressed in his new identification as "Monsieur" Garon. The author of Prospect of Death is named "Mr. Pomfret" instead of "Lord Roscommon," and a change from "Jew" to "Turk" alters Lovelace's remark in the third edition, on the question of whether women have souls, "I am a very Turk in this part, and willing to believe they have not." As is true of the second edition, there is extensive evidence that Richardson also worked hard in 1751 to improve the general quality of his text, for he again made thousands of small substantive changes in single words or small phrases, continuing certain patterns of revising that he began earlier. 24 There are, for example, 38 more changes of "mamma"-"papa" to "Mother"-"Father"; class distinctions are again observed with more precision by shifting 8 instances of "gentleman" and 55 instances of "lady" to "man" and "woman" or to neutral terms such as "friend," "person," etc. Thirty-one more references to Lovelace's relatives are changed from "my aunt" or "my uncle" to their proper names, "Lady Betty," "Lord M.," etc., and 5 expletives are softened in expressions like "Good God" to "Good Heaven." There are several dozen instances in which adjectives, verbs or adverbs are altered to intensify the language, though these changes are not numerous in proportion to the magnitude of the novel. Uncle Antony calls Arabella's decision not to marry Lovelace a "cruel resolution" not an "unhappy" one; Lovelace is now a "wretch" and a "contriver," not a "man" or a "fellow." He has "betrayed" not "trick'd" Clarissa, and Mrs. Sinclair and her employees are described as people so "abhored" not "hated." Anna laments the Harlowes' "cruel treatment" of their daughter, not their "conduct," and she speaks of their "dislike" rather than their "resentment" of Lovelace. Clarissa's fits have not just "weaken'd" her, but "disordered" her, and she is shown "submitting" instead of "resigning" herself to her father's will. Those who arrest her are chided for their "detestable insolence," not their "insolence"; Lovelace has "cruel reflections," not "reflections," on his past actions, and Belford warns him of the "shocking scenes," not "scenes," which may haunt his deathbed. Dozens of expressions are made more pointed and concrete. Mrs. Howe tells Anna that rarely does a handsome and sprightly man make a "tender and affectionate" husband, not just a "good" one. Lord M. is prepared now to present Clarissa "a very valuable set of Jewels," not "several valuables," as he did earlier. The "Park" becomes "St. James's Part" [sic]; Clarissa "got to her Father's" not "thither"; "may not be so" becomes "may not be light." Lovelace's fictitious wedding license is granted by permission of "Edmund" not "N.N." "They" becomes "those Ivy-cover'd Oaklings," "she" is replaced by a variety of descriptive phrases or specific names, such as "passionate Beauty," "the dear Creature," "the wench," "my Beloved," etc., and "He" becomes "My Chevalier," "Mr. Belford," "Mr. Lovelace," etc. Occasionally new brief phrases sharpen an image. Mrs. Sinclair twangs out a High-ho "thro her nose"; Lovelace cries out on his death-bed "as if he had seen some frightful Spectre," etc. In about a dozen instances some colorful expressions become less flamboyant, but of these at least some were clearly reshaped to fit the speaker's character more realistically, i.e. more appropriately to their station, education, and ethos. Charlotte Montague no longer writes to Lovelace that "His Lordship frets like gum'd taffaty," but says "His Lordship is very much displeased." She prepares to come "to town," not to "the great beastly town." Clarissa does not write of "your gay dressers," but speaks "of those who value themselves on dress and outward appearance." Lovelace describes Clarissa's letter after the rape as an "affecting" not a "plaguy" one, and he now writes to Clarissa that Lord M's commands "shall not have the least weight with me" instead of "shall not weigh with me one iota." Mowbray's exclamation "Lords-zounter, if I have patience with him!" becomes "The devil fetch me, if I have patience with him!" In most cases of this sort, a more noble tone is gained at the deliberate expense of idiomatic, piquant colloquialisms. The change is well integrated into the massive refinement of thousands of details, already undertaken by the author in his second edition, designed to enhance the tone of his novel through greater formal clarity and disciplined restraint. Cases of this sort furnish at least modest counter-evidence that needs to be weighed carefully by a critic trying to generalize about the greater "freshness" of the first edition in contrast to the third. Like other aesthetic qualities, freshness is not absolute in value. Measured by its function in a complex context that includes other significant artistic considerations, its sacrifice may be a loss, but one that secures other desirable pleasures of the aesthetic imagination. In this novel, it is in some instances easy, in some others exceedingly difficult, to weigh the freshness lost against certain gains. Richardson also trims a few more of his inventive adjectives, as he had done in the second edition; the "solemn wou'd-seem-wise doctors" becomes "of solemn and parading Doctors," "the poor dying, wise-too-late Belton," becomes "the poor dying Belton," "studied-for desire" is changed to "studied desire," "my broken-vowed obedience" to "my vowed obedience," "wry-facing woe" to "wry-fac'd woe," and the very clumsy "O forgive the distracted-thoughted Mother!" is revised as "O forgive the almost distracted Mother." However, "the right path" becomes "the fore-right path" and "her unseasonable love" is changed to "her unseasonably-expressed Love." Of course many unusual expressions are not touched at all. Much of the general tidying up of the text actually began a few years earlier, even in manuscript form. But once again many different contractions and abbreviations are spelled out in 1751, either by Richardson or his printer: "han't you" to "have you not"; "ha" to "have"; "'Twas" to "He was"; "i'n't" to "Is it not"; "I'd" to "I would"; etc. Proper names are frequently given in full, " Mond. Morning " to " Monday Morning "; "CL. HARLOWE" to "CLARISSA HARLOWE"; numbers and times are spelled out fully: "100 guineas" to "an hundred guineas," etc., and "10 o'clock" to "Ten o'Clock." Even "D—n him" becomes "Damn him." Many grammatical changes are made to correct earlier errors: ("nothing . . . are wanting" to "nothing . . . is wanting"). Words and phrases are frequently added to fill out thoughts and round out sentences ("she has" to "that she has"; "and owed" to "and have owed"); several dozen phrases ending in prepositions are modified ("which they are moved to" to "to which they are moved"); comparatives are altered ("the miserablest" to "the most miserable"); some past participles are changed ("had broke" to "broken"; "shewed" to "shewn," etc.); and hundreds of single words are replaced: "deprivation" by "catastrophe"; "Gala" by "Festivity"; "Beloved" by "Charmer," etc. When one turns from all the changes deliberately introduced by Richardson in 1751, one finds some minor mistakes in spelling, printing, etc. Aside from these, two important errors creep into the third edition. Letter XXVI in Volume II is incorrectly dated April 9 instead of April 6, and this error can still be found in The Shakespeare Head edition (1930), as well as in the Everyman's Library (1932) text. There is also a transposition of the first line of type to the top of page 110 in Volume V, instead of to page 111, but this slip is not retained in later texts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The final revisions of Clarissa were made in 1759, when the author published it for the fourth and last time. There has been almost no discussion of this edition. On the rare occasions when scholars have referred to it in print, their remarks have reflected a general uncertainty about the extent of its changes. In his introduction to his Riverside abridgment, George Sherburn is the only one to comment explicitly on this version, and even he speaks cautiously about it: "The 1759 text (not printed with scrupulous care) makes perhaps final revisions and additions." His own abridgment, he says, "follows the tradition of conflation: it is based on the faulty text given in Everyman's Library , which has been collated with that of 1759, which in turn, chiefly for misprints, omissions of essential words, etc. has been compared with the texts of 1748 and 1751." 25 The fourth edition is the only one published during Richardson's lifetime that exactly duplicates the pagination of its predecessor. It is also the only one with relatively few changes in accidentals. In the second and third editions there are as many as one or two dozen changes in spelling, capitalization or punctuation per page. In most cases these are not isolated changes, for they form deliberate patterns introduced by either Richardson or his printer to alter the appearance of the text. Proper nouns are systematically capitalized in 1749 and 1751; the number of commas is reduced; other forms of punctuation are simplified; contractions are spelled out. In contrast, most pages of the fourth edition have no changes whatsoever, either substantive or accidental. The scattered variations found here and there are errors in printing, or in some cases, acceptable alternatives recognized among eighteenth-century printers. Other than alterations in accidentals, there are only 5 changes in the fourth edition necessary to consider here, and at least one of them is an error. This simple fact is in startling contrast to all we know about each of the earlier editions, so scrupulously revised, page by page, by the author. It also rules out the need to consider the fourth edition as a serious source of evidence for Richardson's final intentions. The error is in the date of Lovelace's letter XXVI to Belford, shown as "Sat., Aug. 23" in the fourth edition, when it should be "Sat., Aug. 5," the date that is found in all earlier editions, and which can be reconstructed from the contents of the first paragraph of that letter. The other four changes are quite minor, and may not all have been by Richardson's hand. In Volume VI there is a double alteration in the phrase "without saying, By your leave, Mrs. Rose-bush, to the author of it" (3rd ed., VI, 214) to "without saying to the mother of them, By your leave, Mrs. Rose-bush" (4th ed., VI, 214). Volume VII contains a revision in Arabella's closing to her letter XXIII of Thursday, August 3, from " Your grieved Sister (3rd ed., VII, 76) to " Your afflicted Sister " (4th ed., VII, 76). Finally, there are two minor alterations in the Postscript, perhaps not even made by Richardson, in sections that had been added in 1751. The first moves a footnote into the main body of the text (4th ed., VIII, 292); the second changes "the character of Mr. Hickman" to "Mr. Hickman's character" (4th ed., VIII, 292). The fact that there are literally no other additions, deletions or alterations means that for all practical purposes Richardson's work on Clarissa closed with the expanded edition of 1751. This tallies with comments in his correspondence to the effect that he was interested in devoting his last years to revisions of Pamela , so that "she may not appear, for her Situation, unworthy of her Younger Sisters." 26 In March, 1761, two years after the fourth edition was published, one of Richardson's daughters wrote to Lady Bradshaigh requesting her marked copies of Pamela and Clarissa . But it is primarily Pamela that Richardson is still interested in, for the letter makes it plain that a new edition of that novel is needed: "the four Vols. of Pamela being almost out of Print, and a new Edition called for, and being delighted to hear, that your Ladiship has remarked upon that Piece and Clarissa, he [Richardson] directs me to express his earnest Wishes, that you will favour him with the Perusal of your Observations, with Liberty to add to new ones of his own such of your Ladiship's, as may make ye future Edition more perfect than otherwise it can be." 27 Eaves and Kimpel point out that her marked copy of Clarissa is still in the possession of Lady Bradshaigh's descendants, and that it does in fact recommend a number of changes Richardson would have been likely to listen to. 28 Just which of her suggestions he might have incorporated into a new edition became an academic question all too soon, because his death on July 4, 1761 deprived him of that opportunity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Taking into account now the full scope of Richardson's revisions after Clarissa was first published, it should be clear that they vary enormously in their length, purpose, function and value. Many of them form patterns of one kind or another; others resist being grouped. Some elaborate with concrete vividness the implications of a brief fictional situation, breathing life into what had been only skeletal. Other changes, even some good ones, merely amplify something already done effectively in the first edition, and these need not have been made. Still others, fairly numerous, are indifferent in their aesthetic effect. These too are unnecessary, for they change single words, small phrases, even whole paragraphs, but without significantly improving (or disfiguring) the original. There are important differences among the three revised editions. The final one is clearly unique in offering negligible evidence of revision. The second concentrates on myriad smaller refinements in the text, and it must be remembered that nearly all of these changes are retained in the third edition. The second one also contains only 11 revisions that exceed one page, whereas the third has 42 such items, and 6 of these are more than 8 pages. On the other hand, 28 footnotes enter the second edition, 18 of which specifically evaluate Lovelace's evil and Clarissa's delicacy. They stand as vigorous warnings by an "editor" unwilling to let the narrative framework speak for itself. Two years later, only 7 footnotes were added, none of them addressed to the twin problems that troubled Richardson in 1749. Even the individual volumes differ in the extent to which they underwent revision. Judging by the clustering of his efforts, Richardson thought his most persistent problems lay in Volumes III and IV. In 1749, he made 67 of his 102 "most material changes" in these volumes, only 35 in Vols. I and II. In 1751, of the 107 changes (of one line or more) also made in the first four volumes, 85 occur in Vols. III and IV, only 22 in I and II. This is not surprising. Volumes III and IV pit Lovelace and Clarissa in frequent close confrontation, requiring a delicate balance between revelation and suspense to keep her rape a surprise. In contrast, their encounters are rare throughout the first two volumes while Clarissa resides at Harlowe Place. After the penknife scene in Vol. V they never meet again. Despite all the effort Richardson lavished on his two major characters, both still remain flawed in some essentials. His best changes in the heroine isolate her more decisively from her family, they rid her of certain vexing moral blemishes, and they stress her spiritual ascendancy. The least successful merely lengthen the novel, sometimes quite mechanically, with renewed testimonies of her habits, virtues and accomplishments. During more than 200 years, those who (unlike Henry Fielding) have not been moved by her plight, have perhaps wished she were more humanly attractive, e.g. at least sometimes less grave and studied, less ready to argue a point in return, amidst her trials. Similarly, Richardson never perfectly solved his dilemma with Lovelace. His aristocratic rake stands out as one of the truly unforgettable creations in literature, but at the price of undermining one of Richardson's deepest intentions. Despite several detailed changes, Lovelace never loses his basic power to command fascinated and pleasurable attention, blunting one's sense of his underlying viciousness. The stimulating complexity of his character, and the eloquent appeal of his best traits, are too deeply imbedded in the tightly textured structure of this novel to be changed easily. The further signs of his actions and hopes supplied by Richardson's revisions do not alter their essential direction or aesthetic impact. A major overhauling of Lovelace's beguiling point of view, a thorough reshaping of his basic functions, would be necessary to achieve the delicate balance sought by Richardson between making Lovelace plausibly attractive to someone as clairvoyant as Clarissa, and rendering him a repulsive villain who incarnates the blandishments of a ruthless world. Revisions of other characters, taken as a whole, are also mixed in quality. One effective set consists of the touches made to etch the Harlowes' evil more deeply in their characters, and to strengthen their opposition to their daughter. However, some of the individual changes in Anna Howe and Belford merely expand roles previously well developed, and these could certainly have been omitted. On the other hand, a number of expanded scenes between Anna and her mother are finely sparked, augmenting a vein of comic relief amid the stark tone of the novel. A very good start was made in the case of Hickman, but it was never carried to completion beyond Volume II with equal skill. One asset of the third edition is its improved prose. Philip Stevick recognizes this advantage, but he nonetheless argues that the stylistic confusions of the first edition imitate real letters more authentically: "Writers of letters do not always make their pronoun antecedents perfectly clear. Letters are written in haste, to people one knows. And thus it may be that, although the revised text is better prose, the text in the first edition produces far more successfully the illusion of authentic letters unmediated by a controlling author." 29 The illusion of epistolary spontaneity is undoubtedly achieved by many factors, not the least of which is the author's ability to select and control his material with such precision that only those effects he wants will be secured and others will be excluded. Even though careless haste is sought as an artistic effect, it is not necessarily well imitated by mere carelessness on an author's part, for this is precisely that fine line where art and nature part company. George Sherburn noted in 1962 that most texts of Clarissa have passages eclectically conflated from different editions, and "Richardson's more complicated sentences seem at times to have influenced even the pressman to attempt clarification by verbal changes." 30 One distinction shared by all the editions revised by Richardson is that some of his most troublesome and puzzling syntax structures are smoothed out. One only regrets that he did not do more, and do it consistently better. Close study of two versions of one passage from the novel's early pages illustrates in a microcosm many of the typical smaller patterns of change that permeate the novel. The italics are mine: I fainted away with terror, seeing every-one so violent; and hearing his voice, swearing he would not depart without seeing me, or making my uncles ask his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands: a door being also held fast locked between them; my mamma struggling with my papa; and my sister, after treating him with virulence, insulting me, as fast as I recovered. But, when he was told how ill I was, he departed, vowing revenge (1st ed., I, 26). I fainted away with terror, seeing every one so violent, and hearing Mr. Lovelace swear that he would not depart till he had made my Uncles ask his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands; a door being held fast locked between him and them. My Mother all the time was praying and struggling to with-hold my Father in the great parlour. Mean while my Sister, who had treated Mr. Lovelace with virulence, came in to me , and insulted me as fast as I recovered. But when Mr. Lovelace was told how ill I was, he departed, nevertheless vowing revenge (2nd ed., I, 26). By adding new prepositions and relative pronouns, and by using conjunctions differently, Richardson achieves much more control of his fiction. The pronoun "him," introduced in the phrase "him and them," unequivocally differentiates Lovelace from the uncles; and the three substitutions of "Mr. Lovelace" for pronouns emphasize his unique identity and association with the speaker (Clarissa) early in the first volume. The exchange of "Mother"-"Father" for the intimate terms of endearment "Mamma"-"Papa" establishes a more formal relationship between Clarissa and her parents, preparing us for the developing rift between them. The restructuring of the sentences in the paragraph reflects small shifts in the way character and event are unfolded. One motive for Lovelace's decision to remain in the room (his desire to see Clarissa) is deleted from the second edition, leaving only his heated demand for reparation from Clarissa's uncles. This delays disclosure of his concern for her until the dramatic last line, when he abruptly departs upon learning of her illness. The setting is now specified concretely as "the great parlour," and the scene between the struggling parents is more vividly developed. With respect to the question of Richardson's final intentions, I do not agree with Kinkead-Weekes that the third edition does not represent them accurately, allegedly because it was revised to answer charges from a hostile audience. Clearly some important changes were spurred by critics after the first and second installments of his first edition came out. One can safely put in this category the editorial footnotes which unmask Lovelace and defend Clarissa, as well as certain other changes discussed by the author himself in his expanded Postscript to the third edition, e.g. those concerning Hickman. Important as they are however, they constitute only a fraction of his extensive attempts to reshape Clarissa . Nor can we be sure that even the most heavy-handed revisions were not part of Richardson's initial scheme (i.e. integral to his original intentions for this novel), whether or not they are aesthetically satisfying. Eaves and Kimpel claim that Richardson was already at work blackening his rake in the manuscript stage. 31 This is confirmed by a letter he wrote to Aaron Hill on October 29, 1746, a full year and 3 months before publication of the first two volumes: "Lovelace's Character I intend to be unamiable, as I hinted: I once read to a young Lady Part of his Character, and then his End; and upon her pitying him and wishing he had been rather made a Penitent, than to be killed, I made him still more and more odious, by his heighten'd Arrogance and Triumph, as well as by vile Actions, leaving only some Qualities in him, laudable enough to justify her first liking." 32 Clearly the author tested the effects of his novel inductively, and he altered it as discoveries emerged, long before any publication. Apparently he also cut out many other original passages, for Eaves and Kimpel have concluded "that there were a good many more of Lovelace's and Clarissa's letters given in full in the earlier version than in the final one . . ." 33 though they are careful to point out that only three passages can be identified with any certainty as restored in 1751 from any manuscript antedating the first edition. 34 Of the three restorations they establish, at least two are notably poor in art: one letter from Lovelace, planning to abduct and rape Anna and Mrs. Howe—a scheme so wild and gross that it seems far-fetched even for him; two letters from Elias Brand that become tedious due to their excessive length, defeating their comic intent. Richardson's decision to restore certain passages probably only reaffirmed his earlier judgments that they belonged there in the first place, and that he had erred in removing them to scale down his novel's burgeoning length. It is almost impossible to tell from internal evidence alone which additions were newly written in 1751, and which ones were truly restored as part of his original conception. In summary, Richardson's original and final intentions, and the sensitivity of his contemporaries, may not be entirely at odds. His critics may well have convinced him that his initial instincts regarding Lovelace were sound, and that only a very evil genius could powerfully test Clarissa's soul. From this perspective, the problem of final intentions is more subtle than is suggested by Kinkead-Weekes' argument on behalf of the first edition. If the third edition, with all its gains and losses, does represent its author's final intentions, why consider any other as the basis for a new printing? The answer to this question will depend upon the nature of the audience to be served. Since the fourth edition contributes almost nothing to the novel, and the second consists of only the first four volumes, an editor choosing a copy text has only two basic options: between the original and the third editions. Unfortunately, each compromises some desirable features of the other, and the length of Clarissa makes it impractical to preserve both of them completely in a double column version. Intertwined with the difficult problem of a definitive text is another very fundamental question arising from our basic reason for reading Clarissa at all, namely, which edition is aesthetically more satisfying? One advantage of the first edition is that it is a whole volume shorter. A certain magnitude or length is necessary to make us feel pained by Clarissa's suffering, and to dispose us to value her death as more desirable than continued life. But it is doubtful whether the general quality of the new material outweighs the drawback of prolonging a novel that needs pruning more than amplification. Secondly, while it is true that the writing is more pointed and polished in the third edition, more sublime as befits the novel's tragic end, one can exaggerate even this gain in a work as dense as Clarissa . There may well be some loss in freshness too, though this is hard to estimate. For many, the third edition is distressing in its more obvious didacticism, whereas the first reduces the instances where this occurs. Unhappily, it is not possible to accomplish such reduction without sacrificing something worthwhile, unless one puts together an eclectic text. This last seems to be Kinkead-Weekes' conclusion, though he backs off from stating it emphatically. An eclectic text would not necessarily give scholars the best of Richardson. It would risk losing both the purity of the first edition and the completeness of the third, replacing each with something that has the merits of neither. Too many important decisions would depend upon the critical assumptions and taste of a modern editor, even a very good one. Moreover it is difficult to anticipate how future generations might value certain passages. For example will the lines judged to be unacceptable today displease tomorrow? Even if one did excise the passages which blacken Lovelace the most (e.g. the editorial footnotes), what about all those hundreds of other changes, both large and small, that are neither good nor bad, yet belong to the total canon of Richardson's revisions? For those who consider the third edition too didactic for a popular version, the first still offers a genuine alternative. It should be available for anyone who wishes to use it, bringing Clarissa to readers in its most original printed form. It is a well printed text, and it possesses some other attractive features of its own. There now is an abridged version of it on the market; it would be useful to have a complete one available. Nonetheless scholars should never be satisfied with anything less than a complete record of Richardson's art. His efforts to revise Clarissa are so varied and voluminous, so reflective of his inventive strengths and weaknesses, so much a part of his own peculiar genius for delving into the heart's recesses in homage to moral norms, they deserve detailed attention. Any critical edition which excluded all this testimony from an apparatus would deprive scholars of one of the richest sources of evidence that can stimulate a more exact understanding of this novel, of Richardson's creative talent, and of his role in the development of the novel form. No matter how ambivalent one might feel about the exact merit of certain revisions or patterns of revision, it would be a disservice to deprive future generations of the opportunity to judge Richardson's art fully and afresh.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Vathek in English and French by Kenneth W. Graham</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1929 a red herring was drawn across the path of Vathek scholarship by Herbert P. Grimsditch. 1 This herring, although not so red or noisome as an earlier one which stated that the French version of Vathek is a retranslation of the English version, 2 presented questions which still trouble English-speaking admirers of Beckford's tale. Grimsditch's herring was a new translation of Vathek , justified in an introduction which stated that the translation of Vathek published in 1786 by Samuel Henley is frequently inaccurate and does not reflect the revisions instigated by Beckford in successive editions in the French language. Grimsditch offered in its place a new and accurate translation of the last-revised French-language edition published in London in 1815. Without considering the merits of Grimsditch's translation, which is competent although not without its own inaccuracies, 3 I would like to call attention to the dangerous assumption upon which the translation is based, the assumption that the Henley version of Vathek is a translation and may be judged according to its correspondence to the French-language edition it is alleged to translate. Such an assumption could lead to "new and more accurate" translations springing into existence every fifty to one hundred years depending upon the shifting vagaries of the French and English languages, the inspiration of potential translators and the market for new translations. The assumption that the English Vathek is a translation would relegate it to a low position in English letters since scholars are naturally unwilling to study a work not in its original form. Grimsditch was accurate in his observation that the English version of Vathek frequently does not supply a faithful rendering of the French text. The versions of Vathek in English and French do differ and the differences are significant. A review of the processes of translation and revision which led to the existence of two differing versions of Vathek will demonstrate, however, that these differences are quite in accord with Beckford's wishes. The main purposes of this paper are to assert the authority of the English version, to demonstrate significant differences between the two final authorized versions and to reach conclusions regarding the substantive relationship between Vathek in English and Vathek in French. This study of the two versions may convince some readers that the English Vathek has considerably more merit than it has been accorded. The assumption that the English version of Vathek published in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is a translation is only half right and Grimsditch's contention that the English version of Vathek should reflect the last-revised French-language edition of 1815 is totally wrong; both positions ignore the history of publication of the English version. Doubts about the authority of the Henley version result in part from the well-known story that the impecunious Henley published his translation in 1786 without Beckford's knowledge and counter to Beckford's express direction to postpone publication for at least a year. 4 It appears to be less well-known that Beckford collaborated in the preparation of the English version. The record of the correspondence between Beckford and Henley reflects clearly a procedure whereby Henley sent completed sections of his translation to Beckford for correction. A letter to Henley of 26 February 1785 indicates Beckford's delight on receiving the first part of Henley's translation: "Your translation has all the spirit of the Caliphs &amp; their daemons. I long for the continuation, &amp; hope you will gratify my impatience." 5 Beckford's next letter of 21 March 1785 shows his enthusiasm to be undiminished even after a month's deliberation: You make me proud of Vathec . The blaze just at present is so overpowering that I can see no faults; but you may depend upon my hunting diligently after them. Pray send the continuation, I know [not] how it happens; but the original when first born scarce gave me so much rapture as y r translation. Were I well &amp; in spirits I should run wild amongst my rocks and forests, telling stones, trees &amp; labourers how gloriously you have succeeded. My imagination is again on fire. 6 Beckford's next letter finds him correcting Henley's translation according to his promise: "I shall sit down immediately to revise Vathec , and much approve y r idea of prefacing the tale with some explanation of its costume" [9 April 1785]. 7 The remaining record of correspondence shows the nature of the collaboration: Beckford's letters give advice on the text but freely supply information to Henley on matters of "costume"; Henley's replies concern themselves with details of Arabian history and culture but offer advice on the text of the tale. Two of Henley's recorded suggestions were incorporated into the text of the English Vathek : the substitution of palampores for chintzes and the alteration of the punishment that overtakes Carathis. Three significant facts are revealed from the correspondence between Beckford and Henley and its relationship to the authoritative 1816 edition of the English text: the English version prepared by Henley had Beckford's enthusiastic approval; Beckford collaborated in its preparation; neither Beckford nor Henley felt constrained to make the English version a faithful representation of the French. Beckford's involvement in the preparation of the English version precludes it from being treated as an ordinary translation. Not only did Beckford collaborate in the preparation of the original English version, but later, when he had the time and inclination, he revised thoroughly the text and notes of the English version for the second edition of 1816. The extent of that revision is revealed in a recent publication of Vathek edited by Dr. Roger Lonsdale for Oxford University Press which lists by rough count a total of 518 substantive variants between the first and second editions. 8 If, as Grimsditch has noted, there are discrepancies between the text of Vathek in French and English, they exist because Beckford allowed them to exist. To reject the English Vathek as a bad translation is to accept the dubious position that the English Vathek purports to be a translation, a position that Beckford by his actions seems to have rejected. Indeed, why should Beckford wish to make the English version a faithful translation of the French? Believing himself to be in control of the final English version, he would wish to ensure only that the English text is imbued with the "spirit" (and that is Beckford's word) of Vathek . The English Vathek is, in fact, little less than an independent version of the tale. The history of publication of Vathek in French demonstrates a similarly independent development of the text. Vathek in French underwent three noteworthy revisions in its first three editions: Lausanne 1787, Paris 1787, and Londres 1815. Of the first revision, owing to the disappearance of Beckford's French manuscript, very little can be known. It seems that, upon being informed of Henley's unauthorized publication of Vathek in English, Beckford placed the French manuscript in the hands of David Levade, 9 a professor of theology in Lausanne, with instructions to correct any faulty French and to rush it into print. Beckford, although proud of his fluency in French, appears to have had no illusions about the purity of his usage. That Levade's revisions were minor is borne out by the existence of an early, and very literal translation of the manuscript done into English in 1782 by Beckford's tutor, Dr. John Lettice. This fragmentary translation bears a remarkably close resemblance in diction and word-order to the French text published by Levade. 10 The inadequacy of Levade's revision of the manuscript is demonstrated further by the remarkable impurity of the French and by the fact that a heavily-corrected version was published in Paris at the end of July 1787. The improved French of the Paris edition is believed to be the result of the attentions of François Verdeil, Beckford's personal physician, and Louis-Sebastian Mercier, a playwright, critic and journalist, the author of Tableau de Paris . The Paris edition formed the basis of the succeeding and most authoritative French version published twenty-eight years later. This edition, Londres 1815, was the first French-language edition to be published under Beckford's entire supervision; its relatively few revisions are, for this reason, of particular importance. For the sake of clarity and by way of summation, I will insert here a brief description of the first five editions of Vathek . a. In English An Arabian Tale . From an Unpublished Manuscript with Notes Critical and Explanatory. London: Printed for J. Johnson, in St. Paul's Church-yard, and Entered at the Stationer's Hall. MDCCLXXXVI. This is the unauthorized publication edited by Samuel Henley. A re-issue of this edition with a cancel-title leaf appeared in 1809. Vathek . Translated from the Original French, Third Edition, Revised and Corrected. London: Printed for W. Clarke, New Bond Street. MDCCCXVI. This is the true second edition. A second issue of this edition which includes a number of revisions supplies the text used in my comparisons. A third issue, with the title page altered to include the names of the booksellers, Taylor and Hessey, is without textual significance. b. In French Vathek . A Lausanne, chez Isaac Hignou &amp; Comp e . M. DCC. LXXXVII. This edition was edited by David Levade. Vathek, Conte Arabe . A Paris, Chez Poinçot, Libraire, rue de la Harpe, près Saint-Côme, No. 135. 1787. This edition was edited by Louis-Sebastian Mercier and François Verdeil. Vathek . A Londres; Chez Clarke, New Bond Street. 1815. This edition supplies the text used in my comparisons. Thus the history of the first five editions of Vathek in English and French records five significant revisions and the varying influences of five editors: the English text was prepared and revised first by Henley and Beckford in collaboration and then by Beckford alone; the French text passed through the hands of Levade for the first edition, Verdeil and Mercier for the second, and, so far as we know, Beckford alone for the third edition. The third edition of the French text published in 1815 and the second edition of the English published in 1816 are of particular significance because of the special attention Beckford paid to them: the costly format (heavy leading and good quality paper) and careful revision (although more extensive in the English than in the French) suggest that Beckford intended them to be authoritative editions, brought out during a period of leisure after the hurried and unsatisfactory publication of earlier editions. The facts that the two editions were proximate in time and published by the same house, that of William Clarke of New Bond Street, indicate the possibility that the revisions of the editions may have proceeded simultaneously and the certainty that Beckford had the opportunity of bringing the two texts into correspondence had he so wished. In Vathek , then, we have a literary rarity: a work published in two languages, with both versions bearing the authority of the author's own revisions. Like Grimsditch, many commentators have noted that there are significant differences between the two texts, even in their final, authoritative forms. It is a valid critical enquiry to examine these differences and to determine the nature of the relationship between the texts of Vathek published in 1815 and 1816. Thoroughly done, however, such a comparison would require about fifty pages to record the collation notes without commentary. My remarks in the succeeding pages are based on a selection of readings which are distinctly divergent and which form part of a larger pattern of significant divergency. The thesis which these pages will attempt to demonstrate is that a reader, familiar only with Vathek in French, will derive a significantly different sense of the work from that of a reader familiar only with the English version. A study of divergencies reveals three broad areas in which the French differs from the English: in the use of irony, in characterization and in tonal structure. In the appendix to this paper I have listed thirty-eight sets of readings which demonstrate significant substantive differences between the French and English versions of Vathek in the areas I am examining. The selected readings are presented in a note form consisting of five elements: (a) page and line reference to the French-language version, Londres 1815; (b) the reading from that edition; (c) square bracket; (d) page and line reference to the English-language version, London 1816; (e) the reading from that edition. Example: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) 38:23 en foule ] 46:12 crowd, and occasioned no little noise References made to any reading in the subsequent discussion will be to the page and line of the Londres edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Irony In either language one of Vathek 's most attractive characteristics is its irony, but a comparison of the texts demonstrates that the English-language version includes ironies and more trenchant expressions of irony not found in the French version. These ironies may highlight a single statement, transform the implications of an episode, or comment upon the narrative structure. The text of Vathek sparkles with statements of broad or subtle irony. It is not difficult to demonstrate that the English text contains a slightly more generous scattering than the French. Two instances of a negative construction cleverly creating ironic understatement are provided by 26:10 and 70:18. In each case the negative construction and, hence, the irony are missing from the French. The example of 70:18, in which Vathek shows only too clearly an understanding of the forbidden science of astrology, demonstrates the attack on conventional values which proceeds in both versions of the tale, but seems more pointed in the English text. In two instances the English version alone presses this attack through the use of a particular technique, the ironic transformation of a cliché. In 42:12 the translation of "jeunesse" as "the rising generation" conveys a particularly wry irony in view of the direction in which Vathek intends to send the fifty aspiring young athletes. Similarly the use in the English version of the cliché, "for the advancement of science" (60:15), besides reflecting on Carathis' rather outré collection of magical materials intended for purely selfish purposes, also brings into question conventionally cherished notions about the values of scientific studies. The cliché is not used in the French version. A final example of the use of irony to attack conventional values occurs in the onslaught of the bees upon the Caliph and Nouronihar in punishment for the depredations they inflicted on the santons. The idea of the creatures of nature in concert to accomplish God's holy work is expressed in both versions, but only in the English version are the bees described in terms associated with the zealous assemblies of a nonconformist chapel (173:14). In the episode recounting Vathek's sacrifice of the innocents, the English version presents additional irony by communicating an awareness of the discrepancy between appearance and reality. The entries of 38:8 and 38:15 offer the ironic contrast between the appearance of the scene to the spectators and its significance to Vathek. In 39:14 and 41:18 the irony affects our vision first of the children and then of Vathek. Thus, in the English version of the episode, the irony touches all the actors: it castigates Vathek and the Giaour for their wickedness, and the children, parents and onlookers for their gullibility. The effect of the additional irony is to mitigate the horrors of the scene by directing the reader's attention away from the repugnance of the act and toward the frailties of the actors. The final example that I will include under the heading of irony concerns a statement made early in the tale which seems innocent enough but which reflects ironically on the outcome. The presentation in the English version of 2:2 of Vathek's enjoyment of company is in contrast with his normal treatment of his subjects. This simple irony encompasses a latent and sombre irony that is fulfilled in the Hall of Eblis where affability is no longer possible and companions no longer agreeable. Because it includes this reference to Vathek's enjoyment of agreeable companionship, the English version makes the poetic justice of Vathek's fate in the Hall of Eblis more apparent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Characterization The ironic attack on particular characters and groups proceeds more strongly in the English version. The conduct of the 140 resolute rescuers is even more abortive in the English version which has them spilling not most but all of the water they carried so laboriously up the innumerable stairs of the tower (55:12). The populace are also treated more rudely in the English version. There aré three instances of their less attractive qualities being included in the English but suppressed in the French: 24:21 presents their fickleness, 32:10 their absurd appearance, and 38:23 their noise. The discomfiture of Bababalouk during and after the swing incident is expressed with a witty irony absent from the French version of 98:17 and 99:4. The English version also expresses more humorously the absurdly weak basis for Morakanabad's consolation in 61:3, in addition to reflecting upon the singular unattractiveness of the Caliph and his mother. In the English version of 21:3, the addition of a phrase, "instead of confining herself to sobbing and tears", underlines ironically a fact about Carathis' character that has a far-reaching significance: she lacks maternal qualities and is more an homme d'affaires than is her son. These instances of the use in the English version of an additional humour and irony in the presentation of character accentuate a significant variance and confirm the conclusion that a reader's reception of the two versions will differ. It is in the presentation of the character of Vathek that the two versions differ most critically. An examination of passages omitted from the French version reveals a pattern of suppression which must affect the reader's judgment of the central character. As a result of these suppressions, two aspects of Vathek's character, his merit and his absurdity, lack the same emphasis that they receive in the English version. In 3:15 the French version fails to mention Vathek's generosity to the curiosity of others, even when his own cannot be satisfied. In 70:1 the additional phrase, "in the sight of all his people" imparts to the reader of the English version an increased sense of Vathek's magnificence. By grasping a torch to keep off the wild animals, Vathek sets the example for his retinue in the English reading of 76:18. In the French version he follows merely the leadership of others. On two occasions, 4:24 and 35:21, the French version suppresses references to Vathek's insatiable curiosity, his most Faustian characteristic and the sine qua non of his damnation. If the English version communicates a more intense impression of Vathek's heroic qualities, it places also more emphasis on the antiheroic. Vathek's consternation at being bested in eating by the Indian and his concern at the results should the Indian's appetite extend to his wives are offered only in the English versions of 25:19 and 26:16. When Carathis is preparing in the tower an offering to the infernal powers, the English version conveys Vathek's indifference to the mystery of the proceedings, an indifference instigated by the importunity of his empty stomach (50:9 and 52:4). His preferring the meals of the infernal powers to their messages is expressed in the English reading of 57:8 and foreshadows his acceptance of Fakreddin's invitation in direct contravention of the instructions in the parchment. Finally, the caution of the French version in recounting the more extreme aspects of Vathek's character is exemplified by the suppression of three anti-heroic similes: "like a sack of dates" (79:4), "like a mole" (144:20), and "like a carp" (159:3). To accentuate the two views of Vathek as hero and as anti-hero is surely to render more fascinating one of the most bizarre protagonists in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature. To lessen the contrast between the two contradictory aspects of Vathek's character is to diminish the brilliance of the characterization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tonal Structure In a few instances the French version places a slightly greater stress on the horrible or gruesome. In the English version of 57:16 the parchment of the infernal powers expresses gratitude for the lives sacrificed to them; in the French version their gratitude is for the blood . Similarly, only in the French version does Carathis, in preparing her sacrificial pyre, kindle a torch which burns human fat (52:1). In the account of Carathis' deadly little suppers, the French version dwells at greater length and intensity on the tableau of the invited ladies compelled by ceremony to remain seated while vipers and scorpions are allowed to bite and sting at their leisure (62:12). These three examples of an increased sense of horror in the French version would not be worth signalizing were it not that they exemplify a broader difference between the two versions in what might be called the tonal structure of the work. There is in Vathek a tonal turning point at the appearance and admonitions of the shepherd-genius. This scene is a prelude to Vathek's arrival at Istakhar and marks Vathek's last chance to avoid the punishment his crimes have merited. Before this turning point, Vathek's adventures are recounted in a tone of careless humour and light irony. After this episode the tone of the work becomes suddenly oppressive with uncertainty, fear, and, finally, terror. It is on the violence of the tonal contrast between the two parts of Vathek that the effectiveness of Beckford's much-derided moral is dependent. The terror-filled halls of the fallen angel, Eblis, throw into a new perspective the earlier frivolousness of the characters who find themselves there. In the light of the punishment, the nature of the crime becomes more apparent. Consequently, the tonal structure of the work demands the accentuation of the humour and magnificence of the early part of the tale and the terror of the latter part. The English version does both. Examples of additional irony and humour, as well as the increased sense of the magnificence and absurdity of Vathek all to be found in the English version, have already been demonstrated and discussed. Each example cited was drawn from incidents which take place before the tonal turning point of the tale. After that turning point the addition of a few words and phrases to the English version results in a more vivid account of the agony and isolation of those condemned to rage aimlessly and endlessly during an eternity of torment. In 187:23 the English version alone shows the damned grinding their teeth, raging, foaming, frantic. In 205:19 when damnation overtakes "the two princes, who were friends", the English version has them gnashing their teeth, experiencing a hatred that is mutual and unchangeable. The cries that they emit in their agony are stifled in the French version, but in the English their screams cannot be smothered (205:23). The striving after intensity in the portrayal of the damned is marked by the use of two comparisons not to be found in the French version: "more frantic than the wildest maniac" (187:23) and "as if alone on a desert where no foot had trodden" (188:1). Thus, in the last part of the tale, the sense of terror is particularly enhanced in the English version. The French version, in increasing horror and diminishing humour in the first part of Vathek , represents a structurally weaker tale in which the lesson at the end appears to be an afterthought intended to salve the moral indignation of more orthodox critics. In the English version, the crimes and characters of Vathek and Carathis are taken less seriously in the first part. Humour and irony abound in the descriptions of characters and events. But after the turning point, the aura of terror is unmitigated and the nature of the damnation is described more poignantly in the English version than in the French. The final two paragraphs are no longer a moral tag attached artificially to the end of a tale, but an integral part of the story of Vathek and his mother, a reminder that evil acts redound upon the perpetrators. The version of Vathek initiated by Henley has not escaped the opprobrium which has been directed at Henley by successive biographers of Beckford for his betrayal of Beckford's trust. Even Professor Parreaux, in his thorough and commendable study, William Beckford Auteur de "Vathek" , in comparing the early states of Vathek , has not been able to avoid making injudicious criticisms of the Henley text for failing to render accurately the readings in the Lausanne edition. It is hoped that the evidence presented in this paper will at least correct the assumption that the English version attempts but fails to be a literal translation, and perhaps lead to a kinder appraisal of Henley's work, uninfluenced by assessments of his character. The analysis of the dissimilarities between the French and English versions of Vathek has led me to offer a judgment in favour of the English version. My estimate of the contribution of the English variant readings to the structural effectiveness of the work may be debated—I hope it will be. The judgment may encourage scholars to approach the English version with more confidence, however, knowing that an argument for its superiority over the French can be presented. What is certain is that the versions of Vathek in English and French differ to a remarkable extent. It is clear also that the revision of each version proceeded almost entirely independently and that Beckford made no attempt to transform his English version into a faithful translation of the French, in spite of opportunities to do so in his revisions of the 1816 edition. Since the English version of Vathek is a creative adaptation of the version in the original French manuscript, now lost, and since both versions underwent successive, independent revision, the differences between the two final forms of Vathek go beyond those of language. It has been shown that they extend into such essential areas as tone and characterization. A more detailed comparison would show that the differences affect other, less definable areas. A person reading Vathek in French will derive, therefore, a different sense of the work from a person reading it in English. A final conclusion must be that critical opinions based on the reading of one version are not necessarily applicable to the other, and one's reception of critical opinions must be altered in the light of this fact.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 William Beckford, Vathek , translated by Herbert B. Grimsditch, with ten illustrations by Marion V. Dorn (Bloomsbury, London: The Nonesuch Press, 1929). Grimsditch's translation underwent three further publications: in 1945 by the Limited Editions Club, New York; in 1953 by the Bodley Head, London; and in 1958 by the Folio Society, London. 2 The scholar who fashioned this theory was Marcel May in his La jeunesse de William Beckford et la genèse de son "Vathek" (Paris: Les Presses Universitaires de France, 1928). 3 The activities of a swarm of flies buzzing around Bababalouk's head are described by Beckford with the arresting phrase, "Qui lui courtisaient le nez." The phrase is rendered by Grimsditch (Nonesuch edition, p. 76): "which walked over his very nose." Henley's more accurate version captures and, perhaps, surpasses the sardonic spirit of the French: "that busily thronged, to pay court to his nose." 4 The direction is found in a letter to Henley of 9 February 1786: "The publication of Vathec must be postponed at least another year. I would not on any account have him precede the French edition." Henley had reason to fear that the delay could become longer. Beckford had written to Henley that he intended to finish writing The Episodes and to publish them with Vathek in a single French-language edition. It is possible that he might decide on a similar treatment of the English-language version. Beckford had planned to complete The Episodes in one year but, as Henley well knew, severe domestic and social problems were distracting Beckford's attention from his writing. Having laboured on Vathek without remuneration for three years and foreseeing an extended postponement, Henley may be forgiven for publishing his English version independently. Without Henley's act, Vathek might have shared the fate of The Episodes and been published posthumously. 5 Alfred Morrison, Collection of Autograph Letters and Historical Documents , Second Series, 1882-1893 (London: Printed for Private Circulation, 1893), I, 193. 6 Ibid. , I, 193. 7 Ibid. , I, 194. 8 William Beckford, Vathek , ed.

Parreaux demonstrates that Lettice's translation is much closer to the Lausanne text than is Henley's and finally puts an end to speculation that the Lausanne edition is a retranslation of Henley's English version.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the editing of literary texts has long been regarded as one of the basic tasks of literary scholars, I think it can be said that in the last fifteen years an unusual amount of scholarly attention has been directed toward editing and editorial theory. The situation is particularly striking in the field of American literature, for these years have witnessed the development of a coordinated effort—on a scale rare in scholarly endeavor generally and unparalleled in the editing of literature in English—to produce full-scale editions of most of the major (and several other important) nineteenth-century American writers. The need for reliable editions of the principal American figures had been given official recognition much earlier, when the American Literature Group of the Modern Language Association of America established—in 1947-48—a Committee on Definitive Editions, with Willard Thorp as chairman. Although that committee was unsuccessful in securing financial support for such editions, it laid the groundwork for continued discussion, which, after two conferences in 1962, resulted in the establishment in 1963 of the Center for Editions of American Authors. Since that time the Center has coordinated the work on fourteen editions 1 and since 1966 has allocated funds amounting to more than one and a half million dollars, provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities. (In addition, many universities and university presses, as well as the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, have helped with individual editions.) As a result, more than one hundred volumes have now been completed, and others are in various stages of preparation. 2 The fact that an accomplishment of such magnitude, involving the cooperation of more than two hundred scholars, could be produced in little more than a decade of concentrated work—to say nothing of the existence of the Center as an official committee of the MLA or of its support by public funds—suggests a widespread recognition of the importance of the whole undertaking. This is not to say, however, that there is any unanimity of opinion as to the precise editorial principles which ought to be followed, and the CEAA editions have been the subject of a considerable number of critical attacks, directed both to particular editions and to general matters of policy. Now one of the unusual features of the CEAA as a scholarly coordinating committee is that it has insisted, from the beginning, that certain editorial principles be followed in any edition that is to be associated with it and receive its approval. To this end, it has established a seal to be printed in every volume which meets the requirements, certifying that the text is "An Approved Text" of the CEAA. The administration of this plan obviously involves the pre-publication inspection of each text by an examiner appointed by the Center, and the result is that any reader who sees the CEAA seal on a volume knows that its text has been prepared in conformity with a set of carefully defined guidelines, relating not only to editorial theory but to the practicalities of setting forth evidence and of proofreading as well. In essence, the editorial principles of the CEAA—set forth in its Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (originally published in 1967 and revised in 1972) —are those enunciated by W. W. Greg in his famous paper for the 1949 English Institute, "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Although he was talking specifically about English dramatic literature of the Renaissance, his discussion raised basic questions applicable to editorial theory in general, and his "rationale" has since been adopted by various editors working in later periods of English literature as well as in American literature. But some scholars have questioned the applicability of Greg's principles to later literature and have thus questioned the wisdom of the CEAA requirements descended from Greg. The time now seems appropriate—since both the CEAA and its critics have a substantial amount of material in print—to review the phenomenon of this debate. 3 Certainly the existence and the accomplishment of the CEAA as an institution constitute a phenomenon unique in the history of literary scholarship in English; but the response to the CEAA also is phenomenal in the amount of critical notice which it has bestowed on editorial and textual concerns. The controversy has doubtless caused people who normally pay little attention to editing to focus on some of the problems involved in editorial work, and as a result editing may have moved somewhat nearer to being a matter of vital concern to the scholarly literary world at large. Even if the tone of some of the discussion has served as a poor introduction to scholarly debate in this area, the fact remains that a number of respected figures have raised objections on matters of principle, and their criticisms deserve to be given serious attention. Sometimes, as it happens, their comments prove to be beside the point because of a misconception as to the nature of Greg's rationale or of its use by the CEAA; but some legitimate issues, worthy of continuing scrutiny, are raised in the process. An analysis of these discussions, it seems to me, must begin with a re-examination of Greg's seminal essay. By this time, that essay has reached the status of a classic; and, like any classic statement, it has so frequently been adduced to support or refute particular arguments that renewed exegesis of the document itself seems called for periodically. An understanding of exactly what Greg said is a prerequisite for examining, first, what application of his principles the CEAA stands for and, second, what criticisms of his and the CEAA's position have been put forth. In such an examination, it is important always to distinguish between theoretical and practical concerns. Criticisms on either level demand careful attention, but it is no aid to orderly thinking to treat purely practical questions as if they involved theoretical issues. I hope that these notes can begin to clarify the context within which each of the arguments must be judged and can thus help to provide a perspective from which the whole controversy can profitably be viewed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Greg's contribution to the 1949 session of the English Institute, "The Rationale of Copy-Text"—read for Greg by J. M. Osborn on 8 September 1949—was first published in the third (1950-51) volume of Studies in Bibliography (pp. 19-36). (There is a certain appropriateness, therefore, in re-examining the essay, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of its original appearance, in the pages of the same journal.) Since that time it has been republished in the posthumous volume of Greg's Collected Papers (1966), edited by J. C. Maxwell, who incorporated into its text a few minor revisions and a new footnote, as indicated by Greg in his working papers. 4 The essay is not long or complicated and is expressed with Greg's usual clarity. That such an essay should have given rise to so much discussion, and even controversy, is not surprising, however, for it has the kind of simplicity frequently characteristic of great concepts—a sweeping simplicity that results from having penetrated beyond peripheral complexities and arrived at the heart of a problem. Just as it is not easy to achieve such simplicity, neither is it always easy for others to follow or accept it. Greg begins by referring to the first use of the term "copy-text"—by R. B. McKerrow in 1904 in his edition of Nashe—and sketches the history of the idea of "the most authoritative text"; it is evident, from this kind of beginning and from later references to McKerrow's and his own changes of position, that he is presenting his ideas on copy-text as the outgrowth of an evolving train of thought extending back over many years. Indeed, his opening paragraph says nothing about putting forth a new theory but only that he wishes to consider the "conception" and "implications" of a change in McKerrow's position. Although he soon admits (p. 377) that he is drawing a distinction which "has not been generally recognized," his emphasis is not on the novelty of his contribution but rather on the way in which it seems but a natural step in the line of thinking already pursued both by him and by McKerrow. In effect he is saying that he has finally come to recognize something which he had overlooked earlier and something toward which McKerrow had gradually been moving. It is important to notice the historical framework of Greg's essay: for Greg, stepping into the discussion at a particular point in its development, accepts without further analysis certain ideas about scholarly editing—two in particular—which he feels have already been adequately established. First, he makes clear that he rejects "purely eclectic methods," in which an editor has no restraints placed on his freedom to choose among variant readings on the basis of his subjective judgments of their aesthetic appropriateness; the "genealogical method," developed by Lachmann and his successors in the nineteenth century, was, he says, "the greatest advance ever made in this field," because it provided a more objective basis for preferring one text over another. McKerrow's concept of "copy-text"—taking the term to mean, in Greg's words, "that early text of a work which an editor selected as the basis of his own"—is clearly placed in the context of the genealogical method, for it implies that an editor has determined, through genealogical analysis, the "most authoritative text" and therefore the one to which his own text should adhere. By introducing Housman's criticism of the mechanical application of this procedure (the fallacy of believing that the readings of the "authoritative text" which are not manifestly impossible are in fact correct), Greg suggests the direction in which his argument is to move. But he sees no necessity to argue the general superiority of genealogical methods over eclectic ones; at mid-twentieth century this superiority can simply be asserted. A second assumption is that one can reject without discussion the notion of choosing the last edition published during the author's lifetime as the most authoritative. Placing his comment in a footnote—and in the past tense—to suggest how little attention the idea deserves, Greg says, "I have above ignored the practice of some eccentric editors who took as copy-text for a work the latest edition printed in the author's lifetime, on the assumption, presumably, that he revised each edition as it appeared. The textual results were naturally deplorable" (p. 378). Obviously Greg is not saying that one should ignore late revisions which one has reason to think are authorial; but, he is implying, it is no longer necessary to bother refuting the assumption that the last edition in the author's lifetime is automatically the most authoritative. Without going over ground which he regards as already established, then, Greg begins to reflect on current editorial practice and observes that the situation facing editors of English texts is different from that facing editors of classical texts, since the preference for "old-spelling" editions is now "prevalent among English scholars," whereas editors of classical texts normalize the spelling. Greg explicitly says that he does not wish to argue the virtues of old-spelling editions but accepts this "prevalent" view—that is to say, he accepts the view that editions of English works for scholars' use should not involve normalized or modernized spelling and punctuation. It should be clear, therefore, that his essay deals with one particular, if basic, kind of edition and implies nothing about the relative merits of modernized editions for other purposes—a point sometimes overlooked. If the editor of English texts properly follows the general tradition of the genealogical method inaugurated by classical editors, and if he must be concerned with the spelling and punctuation of his text in a way different from classical editors, it follows that his conception of copy-text must contain an additional element. In fact, viewed in this way, as Greg says, "the classical theory of the 'best' or 'most authoritative' manuscript . . . has really nothing to do with the English theory of 'copy-text' at all" (p. 375)—because, under the classical theory, the spelling and punctuation are not involved in selecting the copy-text. By the beginning of the fourth paragraph of his essay, Greg has led the reader, with astonishing ease, to see the current situation in English editing against the background of its development and to anticipate the distinction he is about to set forth between, on the one hand, spelling and punctuation, and, on the other, the words themselves. The rhetorical strategy of the essay demands proceeding explicitly to make this distinction before returning to an examination of McKerrow's changing position (which thereby takes on a new dimension), and this remarkable fourth paragraph (pp. 375-377) contains the essence of what is now referred to as "Greg's theory of copy-text." First of all, it makes the point that an old-spelling edition must rely on some contemporary document, for the "philological difficulties" of attempting to recreate or establish spellings for a particular author at a particular time and place are overwhelming. Second, in view of this practical necessity, it says, one must distinguish between the actual words of a text and their spelling and punctuation: . . . we need to draw a distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them "substantive", readings of the text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression, and others, such in general as spelling, punctuation, word-division, and the like, affecting mainly its formal presentation, which may be regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call them "accidentals", of the text. (p. 376) The explicit separation of these classes for separate editorial treatment is one of Greg's key contributions; the third major point of the paragraph is what that separate treatment amounts to. Separate treatment is justified, the argument goes, because copyists and compositors are known to treat the two categories differently; since they generally attempt to reproduce accurately the substantives of their copy but frequently are guided by their own preferences in matters of accidentals, it follows that later transcripts of a work may depart considerably from earlier ones in accidentals and at the same time be very close to them in substantives. What an editor should do, therefore, as a practical routine, is first to determine the early text which is to be his copy-text; then, Greg says, I suggest that it is only in the matter of accidentals that we are bound (within reason) to follow it, and that in respect of substantive readings we have exactly the same liberty (and obligation) of choice as has a classical editor, or as we should have were it a modernized text that we were preparing. (p. 377) In other words, because a copyist or a compositor reproduces substantives more faithfully than accidentals, substantive variants in later transcripts or editions are more likely to be worth editorial consideration as possible authorial revisions than are variants in accidentals. Now a few observations are worth making in regard to what Greg does and does not say in this statement of his "theory"—particularly as an anticipation of some of the points which, as we shall see, have been raised in recent years. To begin with, while the terms "substantive" and "accidental" are not very happy choices, 5 what is crucial to the theory is the distinction itself, and one should not be distracted from it by other associations which these words have. The terms have by now become so well established in editorial commentary that it would be foolish to attempt to change them, even though their use tends unfortunately to give the impression to the general reader that editing involves an arcane vocabulary and mysterious concepts. The situation is ironic because Greg did not pretend to be dealing with any abstruse concepts: he merely hoped that these two words could serve as a shorthand means for making a distinction between what are popularly regarded as content and form in verbal expression, a distinction with which everyone, in one way or another, has come in contact. Indeed, he goes out of his way to emphasize the fact that he is not setting forth a philosophical theory about the nature of language but is only drawing a practical distinction for use in the business of editing. 6 Naturally he is aware that content and form are never completely separable and that the line separating meaning and formal presentation in written language is not distinct (and philosophically raises complex issues); but for his purposes it is enough to append a footnote (p. 376) acknowledging "an intermediate class of word-forms about the assignment of which opinions may differ and which may have to be treated differently in dealing with the work of different scribes." Since the purpose of the substantive-accidental division is to assist the editor in deciding what variants in a text can reasonably be attributed to the copyist or compositor rather than the author, the focus is pragmatic—on the habits of individuals—and Greg is therefore more concerned with providing a suggestive approach, which can be used with flexibility to meet various situations, than in defining as philosophic concepts two mutually exclusive terms. The procedural recommendation which concludes Greg's paragraph is similarly couched in practical, and flexible, terms: the reason for selecting a copy-text in the first place is the limited nature of historical knowledge about accidentals (the copy-text is selected "on grounds of expediency, and in consequence either of philological ignorance or of linguistic circumstances"), and therefore one should follow the copy-text in regard to accidentals—but "within reason." This last phrase underscores Greg's approach: one follows the "theory" when there is no persuasive reason for doing otherwise, but when one has reason to depart from it, a rigid application of it would be foolish. Because the editor generally has fewer means for rationally determining authorial readings in accidentals than in substantives, he generally follows the copy-text in accidentals; but Greg is not asking him to fly in the face of reason by adhering to this procedure in situations which are exceptions to the generalization. Nowhere does Greg claim that following his rationale will invariably produce "correct" readings; what he suggests is that it offers the safest approach when one has otherwise no particular reason for choosing one reading over another as authorial. The theory clearly is one of expediency. The skillful organization of Greg's essay is nowhere better exemplified than in his return to the subject of McKerrow in the pages following this basic exposition of his theory. The rigidity of McKerrow's approach is the more evident in contrast, and the reader is now in a position to see its limitations; at the same time he recognizes how Greg's ideas developed from McKerrow's and how McKerrow was on the verge of the same insight as Greg. In the 1904 Nashe (which Greg quotes), McKerrow had held firmly to the view that an editor should take as his copy-text the latest edition which could convincingly be shown to contain authorial revisions; so long as some of the variants in that edition were authorial, all its readings should be accepted (since conceivably they could all be authorial), except when they were obviously impossible. McKerrow allowed for some editorial discretion in the determination of what was obviously impossible, but in general he was determined to preserve the "integrity" of individual texts. But by 1939, when he published his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare , he had come to believe that a later edition, even one with authorial revisions, should not serve as copy-text, for—with the exception of those revisions—it would be less likely to reflect the author's manuscript than an earlier edition, which stood that much closer to the manuscript. He thus understood, without explicitly stating, something very close to the distinction between substantives and accidentals, since he now believed that the edition closest to the manuscript preserved the general texture of the work better than later editions and that authorial revisions should be incorporated into the text of that edition. Although this position represented a considerable move away from his earlier fear of eclecticism, 7 he was still not ready to allow an editor to combine readings from more than two editions. When the editor believed a particular edition to contain authorial revisions, he said, all the variants in that edition "which could not reasonably be attributed to an ordinary press-corrector" (that is, in general, all the substantive variants) must be accepted into the copy-text. By the time of his death, therefore, McKerrow was well on his way to the position finally advanced by Greg, 8 the essential difference between the two being in the amount of responsibility given to editorial judgment. For McKerrow, the editor uses his judgment in determining what edition should be copy-text, what edition, if any, contains authorial revisions, and what readings are impossible, but he cannot go further and reject some of the variants in that authorially revised edition as not authorial. 9 For Greg, the editor who has already made certain basic decisions should be allowed to go on and choose among the possibly authorial variants. The effort to eliminate as much editorial decision as possible, he believes, is misguided: Uniformity of result at the hands of different editors is worth little if it means only uniformity in error; and it may not be too optimistic a belief that the judgement of an editor, fallible as it must necessarily be, is likely to bring us closer to what the author wrote than the enforcement of an arbitrary rule. (p. 381) Again Greg's emphasis is on the use of reason and discretion, as it is in the brief summary which follows immediately: "the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but . . . the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text" (pp. 381-382). Greg is careful here to insert a qualifying adverb even in the first part of his statement, which deals with accidentals and thus the more mechanical part of his theory; but in the second part he makes clear that the handling of substantive variants is a matter of critical judgment and cannot be regarded as mechanical in any sense. Not to recognize that substantives and accidentals must be treated in different ways, he points out, has led in the past to a "tyranny of the copy-text"—a tyranny because its readings were thrust on the editor, without the benefit of his critical thinking about their merits. The remainder of Greg's essay, amounting to about half of it, consists of illustrative examples and discussions of particular problems in the application of the theory but does not add any essential point to the basic idea set forth economically in the first half. After citing examples from F. S. Boas's edition (1932) of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and Percy Simpson's edition (1941) of Jonson's The Gipsies Metamorphosed to show the operation of the "tyranny of the copy-text," 10 Greg provides a second brief recapitulation of his rationale (pp. 384-385), reiterating the limitations of mechanical rules and concentrating on the nature of the editorial judgment required for dealing with substantive variants. That judgment depends partly on an evaluation of the circumstances of the production of the editions in which those variants appear and partly on the relative reliability of those editions as suggested by the number of "manifest errors" in them; but the heart of the matter is the editor's evaluation of particular variants in terms of "the likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than their appeal to the individual taste of the editor" (p. 385). Then, to provide more practical help, Greg expands on three points already introduced. First, he suggests that an editor may legitimately decide to alter some of the accidentals of the copy-text and thus provides a gloss on the expressions "within reason" and "generally" which he had inserted parenthetically in his earlier statements about following the accidentals of the copy-text. Spelling or punctuation known to be at variance with the author's can be altered, for instance, and, when substantive emendations are made on the basis of later texts, the spelling of such words can be made to conform with the habitual spelling (if there is one) of the copy-text. Second, he restates in somewhat more detail his belief that an editor should not accept from an authorially revised edition any substantive variant that seems obviously incorrect, that seems not to be a reading which the author would have inserted, or that seems completely indifferent. The latter point illustrates once again the expedient nature of what Greg is proposing: if a variant appears so indifferent to the editor that he has no basis for arguing either for or against its adoption, then he simply follows the copy-text reading as a practical means for deciding what to do. "In such a case," Greg points out, "while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand" (p. 386). Third, he makes explicit (pp. 389-390) what was only implied before, that the choice of copy-text itself varies with circumstances and that situations arise in which one must choose a revised edition as copy-text, as when an author is thought to have overseen a revised edition so carefully that its accidentals as well as its substantives must be taken to carry his approval, or when revision is so complex or pervasive that it is not meaningful to think in terms of emending the unrevised text with later readings ( Every Man in His Humour , Richard III , and King Lear are cited). In connection with all three of these points Greg again defends the use of editorial judgment. When discussing the first he says, "These [decisions to alter accidentals], however, are all matters within the discretion of an editor: I am only concerned to uphold his liberty of judgement" (p. 386). In his discussion of substantives he repeats the view emphatically: I do not, of course, pretend that my procedure will lead to consistently correct results, but I think that the results, if less uniform, will be on the whole preferable to those achieved through following any mechanical rule. I am, no doubt, presupposing an editor of reasonable competence; but if an editor is really incompetent, I doubt whether it much matters what procedure he adopts: he may indeed do less harm with some than with others, he will do little good with any. And in any case, I consider that it would be disastrous to curb the liberty of competent editors in the hope of preventing fools from behaving after their kind. (p. 388) And in the third instance, dealing with the choice of copy-text, he states that no "hard and fast rule" can be laid down but that, whatever text is chosen, the editor "cannot escape the responsibility of distinguishing to the best of his ability" between authorial revision and "unauthorized variation": "No juggling with copy-text will relieve him of the duty and necessity of exercising his own judgement" (p. 390). This sentiment is clearly the dominant motif of the essay; if McKerrow had been reacting against nineteenth-century eclecticism in restricting the role of editorial judgment, Greg is here turning toward more reliance on judgment, but within a framework that does not encourage undisciplined eclecticism. It is in keeping with his approach throughout that Greg ends by saying, "My desire is rather to provoke discussion than to lay down the law." I hope that my account of Greg's essay, by its very repetitiousness, has shown that the essay itself consists of repeated statements of a simple idea. Three times he presents a concise summary of his theory followed by a discussion of particular points implied by it, as if he were turning over an object in his hand, focusing his attention alternately on the piece as a whole and on certain of its details. The simplicity of his proposal is certainly one of its most remarkable features and is a natural result of the emphasis on individual judgment, for a methodology inevitably becomes more complicated the more one tries to substitute rules for judgment in the handling of the various situations that may arise. In somewhat blunt language, Greg's theory amounts to this: it tells the editor what to do when he otherwise does not know what to do. If he does know otherwise—that is, if his analysis of all available external and internal evidence (including, of course, his own intimate knowledge of the author and the period) convinces him that a particular text comes closest in all respects to the author's wishes or that a particular variant is the author's revision—then he does not need further guidance. But when there remains a doubt in his mind, after thorough analysis, about whether, for example, the author gave close attention to the punctuation of a revised edition or whether a particular altered wording, in a text which contains many clearly authorial revisions, was the author's, the editor does need further help, since he has gone as far as reasoning can take him and the results are inconclusive. All that Greg suggests, in effect, is that the editor can most sensibly extricate himself from this situation by keeping two points in mind: (1) successive editions based on earlier editions become increasingly divergent from the earliest edition in the sequence, particularly in such matters as punctuation and spelling, not merely through carelessness but through the natural tendency of compositors to utilize their own habitual forms; (2) when an author makes revisions in a later edition, he may be likely to give considerably less attention to spelling and punctuation than to the words themselves, and even some of the differences in wording in a revised edition may in fact result from the process of resetting rather than from the author's revision. It follows that the editor who chooses the edition closest to the author's manuscript as his copy-text when he does not have strong reason for choosing a later one, and who follows the readings of that copy-text when he does not have strong reason to believe them erroneous or to believe that a later variant in wording (or, more rarely, in punctuation or spelling) is the author's—that such an editor is maximizing his chances of incorporating the author's intended readings in his text. No one would claim—and Greg specifically does not—that this procedure always results in the correct choices, but it tells an editor how to proceed when he most needs such advice (when he has exhausted the available evidence without reaching a decision) and it is more satisfying than tossing a coin (since there is at least a rationale involved, based on a generalization about the incidence of human error and the behavior of human beings in dealing with written language). The fundamental common sense of this approach can be seen foreshadowed in Samuel Johnson's comments on the editing of Shakespeare, when he says that "though much credit is not due to the fidelity, nor any to the judgement of the first publishers, yet they who had the copy before their eyes were more likely to read it right, than we who read it only by imagination." 11 The probabilities favor the correctness of the first edition, and it makes sense to rely on that edition except when there is compelling evidence for not doing so. Expressed in this way—which emphasizes the flexibility and lack of dogmatism basic to Greg's position—this "rationale of copy-text" would seem to apply to all situations. But it is important to raise the question of its universality, for Greg's primary interest, after all, was in the printed drama of the English Renaissance, and all his illustrations are taken from that literature. Did he believe that his rationale was more widely applicable? He was dealing with a period from which relatively few manuscripts have survived, but can the same procedure be applied to texts for which manuscripts do survive? He was working with a period in which greater variations in spelling were tolerable than in later times and in which any editorial supervision of a printed text normally occurred in the printing shop rather than, as later, in the publisher's office with its more highly developed editorial routine; but can Greg's rationale be applied to the products which emerged from the very different publishing circumstances of later periods? Greg's own answer to these questions, I think it can be plainly inferred from his essay, would be Yes. It is true that he limits himself in his illustrations to the field he knows best and limits his more abstract discussion for the most part to printed books, but there are indications that he is thinking in broader terms. For example, in that crucial fourth paragraph, distinguishing substantives and accidentals, he twice refers to "scribes" and "compositors" simultaneously, suggesting that the way human beings react to the two categories is the same regardless of whether they are copying by hand or setting type. He goes on, in the paragraph which follows, to restrict himself to printed books for the historical reason that "the idea of copy-text originated and has generally been applied in connexion with the editing of printed books" (p. 378). The focus of the essay, it must be remembered, is historical: a new approach to editing is set forth as a corrective to what had been developing over the previous century. Since the principal developments in editorial theory had taken place in connection with the editing of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, it was natural that he should set forth his criticisms of current procedure with reference to the same field—and convenient, also, since that was his own area of competence. But he clearly implies that he is dealing with a larger principle that could be illustrated in other ways than the one he has chosen. Indeed, he suggests that the editors he is criticizing might have taken a different approach if they had been more familiar with the problems of variation in works transmitted in manuscript. And then he adds: For although the underlying principles of textual criticism are, of course, the same in the case of works transmitted in manuscripts and in print, particular circumstances differ, and certain aspects of the common principles may emerge more clearly in the one case than in the other. (p. 378) The implication certainly is that he is concerned with a basic concept 12 which might not be clear to one who has dealt only with a particular class of problems. And while his illustrations come from Renaissance drama, some of them do involve authorial proof-correction ( Every Man in His Humour ) and revised editions incorporating corrections derived from authorial manuscript ( Richard III and King Lear ). In any event, his whole approach, stressing expediency and judgment, suggests that he thinks of his procedure as one capable of fitting widely varied situations. When an editor judges that he has sufficient evidence for proceeding in a particular way, he has no need for a plan of expediency; but a lack of sufficient evidence is a common occurrence in dealing with works of every period, and Greg's rationale commands respect in such situations because it is based on what observation shows to be characteristic human behavior. If I have set forth accurately here what Greg says, then it would appear to be a self-evident proposition that his recommended procedure would serve in handling editorial problems involving manuscripts as well as printed books, arising in twentieth-century literature as well as sixteenth. There is one kind of editorial problem, however, which clearly lies outside the scope of Greg's essay. To place presumptive authority for accidentals, as a general rule, in the edition closest to the author's manuscript presupposes an ancestral series, in which the line of editions—with each edition based (for the most part, at least) on preceding ones—leads back to the manuscript. Although some of Greg's examples involve complicated variations (such as the revisions incorporated in the folio text of Every Man in His Humour ), in which a later edition is chosen as copy-text because of the extent and nature of fresh authority (authorial revision or recourse to authorial manuscripts), those examples do not include situations in which two or more texts stand in exactly the same genealogical relationship to a lost ancestor, with no earlier texts surviving. In such a case, Greg's approach offers no help in selecting a copy-text, for no one of these texts is nearer the manuscript (or the antecedent text) than any other. The inapplicability of Greg's rationale to this kind of situation is obvious, once it is pointed out, but it has only recently been examined in detail. Fredson Bowers was confronted with the problem in editing Stephen Crane's syndicated newspaper pieces: the variant texts of a given piece, as they appeared in various newspapers, are all equidistant from the syndicate's proofs which had been sent to those newspapers; in the absence of the proofs, the editor is faced with several texts, any one of which could be chosen as copy-text under Greg's rationale. The solution, as Bowers sets it forth in "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," 13 is to combine the features of these "radiating texts," as he calls them, through a statistical and critical analysis of the variants. In effect, one has to construct a copy-text, and the more surviving texts there are the more accurately can the common ancestor (the lost syndicate proof) be reconstructed. From that point on, naturally, Greg's rationale takes over, and the text thus constructed may be emended with variants from later printings, as may happen with an ordinary copy-text. The essential difference is that, in the case of radiating texts, no one document can serve as copy-text, for no one of the radiating texts can be presumed to have reproduced the accidentals of the syndicate proof more accurately than another. Bowers's detailed exposition of his solution therefore becomes a major supplement to Greg; his essay—which incidentally offers an extremely useful statement of Greg's position—deserves to be taken as a companion piece to Greg's "Rationale," and the two essays together provide a comprehensive editorial theory. Bowers's discussion of radiating texts, in other words, does not invalidate Greg's theory in any sense, but it does show one respect in which that theory is not all-encompassing. No comparable supplement to Greg's theory has been made in the twenty-five years since its first appearance, though many questions have been raised. But these questions (such as the extent to which the idiosyncrasies of nineteenth- or twentieth-century authors' manuscripts should be preserved in print), often interesting in themselves, involve matters of editorial judgment, not the basic theory. It is unfortunately true that such questions have frequently been posed as an attack on the theory; and the failure to distinguish between the theory itself and the individual decisions of editors who are following the theory has rendered much of the discussion less useful than it might have been, if not wholly beside the point. My own summary of Greg in these pages has tried to emphasize those elements of his essay which anticipate the later criticisms. Seemingly it takes many words to explain something which is simple and many assertions to proclaim lack of dogmatism; but the simplicity and lack of dogmatism of Greg's rationale have apparently not been perceived by a number of people, for many of their criticisms are undercut by a recognition of those qualities. A renewed close examination of Greg's essay does not suggest to me any reason to question Bowers's description of its thesis as "the great contribution of this century to textual criticism." 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In the years since Greg's "Rationale" appeared, the person who has done most to make Greg's theory widely known and to demonstrate its broad applicability is Fredson Bowers. His contributions have been of two kinds: (1) general discussions of editing, which call attention to and recapitulate Greg's ideas and which sometimes specifically take up the question of applying his rationale to areas other than Renaissance drama; (2) actual editions based on Greg's rationale, not only showing its workability on a large scale but also developing an appropriate apparatus to accompany texts edited in that way. Bowers began his commentary on Greg's essay, even before it appeared in print, in his 1950 article on "Current Theories of Copy-Text, with an Illustration from Dryden." 15 To use several examples from The Indian Emperour to support the rightness of Greg's approach obviously suggests its usefulness for Restoration, as well as Renaissance, drama; but, more important, Bowers anticipates three objections which he thinks may be raised. One is that editors, afraid of the greater role given to editorial judgment, will complain that too much weight has been given to it; but the reply is that, if an editor is preparing a critical text, "editorial responsibility cannot be disengaged from the duty to judge the validity of altered readings in a revised edition" (p. 13). A second objection is that the result will be a conflated or eclectic text; but, again, a critical text, as opposed to a reprint, is by definition eclectic, and there is no reason to fear eclecticism for its own sake but only irresponsible eclecticism. It is in connection with the third objection, however, that Bowers most usefully expands on Greg's remarks—the objection that even an editor who accepts the responsibility of judging between authorial and nonauthorial substantive readings may hesitate to judge the authority of accidentals and may feel that the accidentals of a revised edition at least possibly preserve some authorial alterations. Bowers's reply calls attention to a point which Greg had not perhaps sufficiently made clear: it is precisely because an editor has less evidence for judging accidentals that he should normally fall back on the first-edition copy-text for them, since one of the few generalizations that can be made about accidentals is their gradual corruption from edition to edition and the unlikelihood of close authorial attention to accidentals in revised editions. If an editor chooses a revised edition for copy-text, as Bowers succinctly puts the matter, "in order to preserve a single accidentals variant which may have been the author's, he is introducing a very considerable number of other alterations which under no circumstances could possibly have been authorial" (p. 16). Bowers preserves Greg's emphasis on the expedient by repeatedly using an expression which helpfully captures the spirit of the procedure: he speaks of the "odds" favoring the readings of the first edition and of the editor "playing the correct odds" in retaining those readings. 16 This first apologia for Greg's theory was promptly buttressed when, only three years later, the first volume of Bowers's edition of Dekker appeared, inaugurating the first full-scale edition to be produced according to Greg's rationale. Besides making that rationale more widely known and demonstrating its use in handling the problems of an actual edition (as opposed to isolated examples of textual problems), the Dekker introduced a form of apparatus which broke with tradition and which was particularly appropriate for reflecting the central ideas of Greg's approach. The traditional apparatus, which McKerrow still supported in his 1939 Prolegomena , was to have two sets of notes, one for recording variant readings and one for making more discursive comment on any matter which the editor wished to address; and the first of these kinds of notes, though not always the second, was placed at the foot of each page of text. The departure of the Dekker edition from this plan is two-fold: it divides the record of variants into several categories (editorial alterations of substantives in the copy-text, editorial alterations of accidentals in the copy-text, press-variants, and substantive variants in pre-1700 editions) and it relegates part of that record to an appendix (all but the first category). The result is to dramatize the differing status of the copy-text from that of later texts by segregating the record of its readings and by specifying every change—in accidentals as well as in substantives—which the editor has made in it. Given Greg's reasoning about the accidentals of the copy-text, it is important for the reader to know where the editor has altered them, so a full record is provided; but it is of no importance, in most cases, for the reader to know the thousands of variants in accidentals which entered the text in later editions, so only the substantive variants in those editions are listed. There is a clear distinction between the record of editorial decisions to emend the copy-text and the historical record of substantive variants in later editions. This apparatus, while it does not clutter the reading page with any but the most significant category of editorial decisions. 17 does enable the reader easily to focus on all the editor's decisions—which is especially important in view of the prominence given to editorial judgment in Greg's rationale. Bowers continued through the 1950s to keep Greg's theory before the scholarly public, in the successive volumes of the Dekker and in various theoretical discussions. 18 But as his work on Dekker neared completion and he turned his attention to the editing of Hawthorne, he produced the first detailed illustration of the application of the theory to the period of machine printing and highly developed publishing firms. His 1962 paper, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," 19 is the principal document which stands between Greg's "Rationale" and the large series of CEAA editions currently in progress. This paper begins by establishing two crucial points which underlie all the others: that a scholarly text must be unmodernized 20 (recognizing this as an issue even for nineteenth-century works) 21 and that it must be critical 22 (recognizing that probably "no nineteenth-century text of any length exists that is not in need of some correction"). 23 Bowers, like Greg, and like the CEAA editors to follow, is concerned with unmodernized critical texts , presenting "classic texts in as close a form as possible to the authors' intentions"; the fact cannot be overemphasized, in the light of later events, that these editors are not attempting to lay down rules for all kinds of editions for all purposes but are concerned with one particular kind of edition. 24 After summarizing Greg's rationale for an audience which at that time was not likely to have been particularly familiar with it, Bowers proceeds to show how Greg's approach accommodates the two principal differences in the kinds of materials with which the editor of a nineteenth-century work is likely to deal: (1) the fact that nineteenth-century American books were normally plated does not mean that alterations do not appear in later printings, and examples from Hawthorne illustrate the necessity for making machine collations 25 of copies of the first printing from a set of plates against copies of the last printing; (2) the fact that authors' fair-copy manuscripts frequently survive from this period means that in such cases the editor will generally find himself employing a manuscript, rather than a first printing, as copy-text, for what Greg said about the usual degeneration of the accidentals from edition to edition applies also to the initial step from manuscript to print. In making the latter point, Bowers clearly restates the view of accidentals which is basic to Greg's whole theory: "if an author's habits of expression go beyond words and into the forms that these take, together with the punctuation that helps to shape the relationships of these words, then one is foolish to prefer a printing-house style to the author's style" (p. 226). 26 The other concern of Bowers's paper is an appropriate apparatus for the kind of edition he is describing, and he lists five classes of material which scholars should expect to find recorded: (1) variants among copies of a single edition, revealed by machine collation of multiple copies; (2) emendations made by the editor in the copy-text (along with discussions of any problematical readings); (3) substantive differences in editions published during the author's lifetime 27 and in any posthumous editions that the editor judges to be of sufficient interest; (4) "all the rejected readings and revisions during the process of inscription" of the manuscript, when a manuscript exists—in other words, the pre-copy-text variants; (5) compound words hyphenated at the ends of lines in the copy-text (and thus requiring editorial judgment to determine how they should be printed in the critical text), 28 along with the copy-text forms of words which are divided at line-end in the critical text. This list is obviously an adaptation of the Dekker apparatus to a situation in which a manuscript may be available, and it also recognizes for the first time the editorial problems which line-end hyphens produce. Acknowledging the amount of effort involved in preparing such an edition, Bowers ends with an explicit reference to the continuity of editorial problems by calling on scholars of American literature to "bring to their task the careful effort that has been established as necessary for English Renaissance texts." In the same year the first volume of the Ohio State ("Centenary") edition of Hawthorne ( The Scarlet Letter , 1962) was illustrating in detail the points made in this paper and was exhibiting the kind of apparatus advocated there. By providing a comprehensive essay analyzing the textual history of the work and the editorial procedures employed and by keeping the pages of the text entirely free of apparatus (unlike the Dekker, all emendations were listed at the end), the Hawthorne edition was to furnish a practical model for the later CEAA editions. Influential as Bowers's work on this edition was, his exposition of Greg which was perhaps of the greatest potential influence came the next year. In 1963 the MLA published a pamphlet, edited by James Thorpe, on The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures ; 29 consisting of four essays, on linguistics, textual criticism, literary history, and literary criticism, it was intended, according to Thorpe's introduction, to offer a "review of some current ideas" for "any members of the scholarly community," particularly those "into whose hands the future of American scholarship will in due course fall." Such a pamphlet, circulated by the MLA—even though it was not claimed to be "an official statement" of the organization—was bound to be widely read and referred to, and Bowers's essay on "Textual Criticism," 30 being concise, up-to-date, and readily accessible, became the most convenient source of information on editing literary texts. In his essay Bowers not only suggests 31 the wide applicability of Greg's rationale, by citing illustrations from Shakespeare, Dekker, Dryden, Fielding, Sheridan, Shelley, Hawthorne, Whitman, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sinclair Lewis, among others, but also sets forth a practical routine to be followed in the process of collating and emending and some considerations to keep in mind in constructing an apparatus and a textual introduction. Because the only editions at that time which illustrated the use of Greg's rationale—and of apparatus which separates the listing of emendations from the historical record of variants—were those with which Bowers himself was associated, he cites the Dekker and the Hawthorne (along with the forthcoming Beaumont-Fletcher and Fielding), thus bringing to those editions the attention of a wider audience than might otherwise have been expected to examine them. When, that same year, the Center for Editions of American Authors was established as an official committee of the MLA, it had available, in Bowers's work, the reasoned and detailed application of Greg's theory to nineteenth-century American literature. And when its Statement of Editorial Principles emerged in 1967, several drafts having been previously circulated for criticism among interested scholars, the principles were those of Greg and the categories of apparatus were those of Bowers's 1962 paper and thus of the Hawthorne edition. It was necessary, of course, for the CEAA to have a public statement outlining its standards, if it was to award a seal (and dispense funds) to individual editions on the basis of adherence to those standards. But the pamphlet has served a larger function, for its practical recommendations of procedure are more detailed than any available in the earlier discussions of editing in the light of Greg's "Rationale." As indicated by its subtitle, "A Working Manual for Editing Nineteenth Century American Texts," the pamphlet concentrates on a step-by-step explanation of the processes of bringing together the "authentic forms" of a text, selecting the copy-text, performing collations (by machine and by "sight"—that is, without a machine), presenting the evidence, writings notes and introductions, and proofreading. It thus attempts to set forth the principles behind this kind of editing as well as to offer practical advice on how to proceed; while addressed specifically to editors who seek CEAA support and approval, it functions also as a way of informing a larger audience, wishing to keep abreast of developments in the scholarship of American literature, of what is involved in these editions. Two features of the Statement deserve particular notice. One is its emphatic recognition of the importance of proofreading in the production of a reliable edition; it sets a minimum of five proofreadings against copy as a requirement for any edition applying for the CEAA seal (p. 11). Second is its provision for the dissemination of these editions by attaching certain conditions to the seal: the editors of editions which received public funds are to forgo royalties, and the publishers of those editions are to make the texts (not necessarily the apparatuses) "available to reprinting publishers no longer than two years after the date of original publication for reasonable royalties or fees" (p. 14). These provisions remain as important parts of the CEAA requirements in the revised edition of the Statement published in 1972, 32 although the new edition makes clearer the fact that the seal is available to any edition which meets the standards, whether or not it has been funded through the Center, and that in such cases no stipulations can be made about royalties or the availability of a text for reprinting. The CEAA, as its Statement indicates, is concerned not only with the production of sound texts and informative apparatuses but also with the practical problems of fostering a general demand for reliable editions and of encouraging their widespread distribution. 33 It should be clear that the CEAA's endorsement of Greg's theory and its requirement of a particular kind of apparatus are separate matters. Greg says nothing about apparatus in his "Rationale," 34 and his approach entails no specific form of apparatus; obviously one can edit a text according to Greg's principles without supplying the reader any apparatus at all. The position of the CEAA on the two must be examined separately. As to its choice of Greg's theory, it could not responsibly have chosen any other. Greg was building on the experience of McKerrow and thus represented the main line of bibliographical development of this century; his theory not only emerged from long experience but had a compelling internal logic of its own. Since, by 1963, Bowers had amply demonstrated—what Greg himself had implied—that this approach was not limited to Renaissance literature, the CEAA was fortunate, at the time of its organization, in having readily available a theoretical position that it could scarcely ignore if it was to promote unmodernized critical texts. Clearly, one might wish to argue that it ought to have decided to promote some other kind of text in the first place; but, aside from the fact that the MLA, as a learned society, has a responsibility to support scholarly work, any text which is modernized or in some other way prepared for the "general reader" must, if it is to be reliable, first entail the research involved in producing a scholarly (that is, unmodernized and critical) text. The CEAA decision, therefore, makes practical sense, particularly if the results of that research are made available, so that editors who wish to produce different kinds of editions can take the evidence already amassed and reinterpret it according to different principles. Here is where the CEAA requirements for apparatus come in. The Center was again fortunate, at its inception, in having previous work to turn to, for the Hawthorne edition provided the obvious example—the work of a nineteenth-century American figure, edited according to Greg, and supplied with an appendix containing a list of editorial decisions as well as a historical record of substantive variants. Recognizing that the precise form in which this material is to be laid out need not follow that of the Hawthorne, the CEAA has never prescribed the physical arrangement of the data; but it has always insisted on the presence of the same categories of information as are found there, because those categories are essential for any reader who wishes to reconstruct the copy-text with which the editor worked and to examine the evidence on which the editor's decisions were based. 35 Inevitably the Hawthorne has served as an influential model in formal matters, 36 but there is no uniformity among CEAA editions in the exact forms employed—only in the kinds of material included. 37 The practice of the Hawthorne in presenting so-called "clear text"—pages of text entirely free of editorial apparatus—has been of particular importance. While the CEAA Statement does not insist on clear text, it strongly urges the use of clear text whenever feasible (there are some kinds of material—especially those not intended for publication, such as letters or journals—for which clear text may be impractical or even misleading); 38 and most of the CEAA volumes have in fact presented clear text. The decisions of the CEAA, in regard to editorial theory and to apparatus, were prudent ones, both in the historical sense that they took advantage of the most advanced current thinking and in the more practical sense that they allowed for maximum future use of the material—since they resulted in basic scholar's editions, which at the same time contained easily readable texts that could be reproduced photographically in paperback and other editions and which offered the evidence that could be utilized by other editors in re-editing the text along different lines. What emerges from all this is the fact that the CEAA does not regard the editions it approves as the only respectable or desirable editions of those works that are possible. After all, its seal reads "An Approved Text," not "The Approved Text"—which can be taken as implying two possibilities: first, since emendations are based on the editor's judgment, another editor, still aiming at an unmodernized critical text and following Greg's theory, may arrive at different judgments and may therefore conceivably produce another "approved text," even under the same general guidelines; second, since a CEAA text is one particular kind of text, the existence of a CEAA text of a work does not preclude the possibility that another kind of text might be worthy of approval for other purposes. 39 What is now referred to as a "CEAA edition," then, is the specific combination of two elements—a text edited according to Greg's theory, combined with an apparatus providing the essential evidence for examining the editor's decisions. 40 In a paper presented in 1968 on the occasion of the publication of The Marble Faun in the Hawthorne edition, Bowers undertook to define the relationship between a "CEAA edition" and the kinds of editions commonly encountered in classroom use. 41 The first he called a "definitive edition," which "establishes with absolute accuracy the exact documentary forms of all authoritative early texts of the work being edited" (p. 52), presents in lists "the concrete evidence on which the establishment of the text has rested" (p. 54), and offers a text reflecting "the author's final intentions insofar as these can be recovered by systematic, principled selection from among the variants of different authoritative forms of the text, supplemented by editorial emendation" (p. 54). The research required for this kind of edition is time-consuming and is carried through without regard for financial return, whereas the editions usually circulated among students and the general public are commercial products, in the preparation of which the factor of expense has to be taken into account. The latter are "practical editions," which "present to a broad audience as sound a text (usually modernized and at a minimum price) as is consistent with information that may be procurable through normal scholarly channels and thus without more special research than is economically feasible" (p. 26). Practical editions, while useful in the absence of more scholarly editions, clearly represent a compromise, and better practical editions can come only as more "definitive editions" are produced to serve as the source of information for them. The CEAA, it is true, is supporting work principally on only one carefully defined kind of edition—but one that provides the materials basic to other kinds of editions, if they are to be reliable. By focusing on these basic editions and at the same time encouraging the use of clear text and the photographic reproduction of these texts by other publishers, the CEAA is accommodating both the needs of scholars and the long-range interests of the general reading public. Of course, some people may feel that it is proper for the CEAA to support basic scholarly editions without believing that Greg's theory (or, perhaps, any other single theory) ought to be the required approach, and they may be inclined to think that such a requirement contradicts the freedom from dogmatism which Greg himself emphasized. This position, however, involves several confusions. To begin with, any standard against which performance is measured must inevitably be dogmatic to the extent that it asserts a particular position, and the CEAA cannot avoid taking a position if it is to attempt to control the quality of work performed under its auspices or published with its endorsement. But that kind of dogmatism, if it can be called such, is an entirely different matter from the dogmatism, or lack of dogmatism, of the position actually taken. Since Greg's approach allows for the operation of individual judgment (providing a dogmatic, or arbitrary, rule only when there is no basis for rational judgment) and since the CEAA has adopted Greg's approach, it follows that the CEAA's dogmatism amounts only to insisting on an approach which in itself minimizes the role of mechanical rules and maximizes that of critical judgment. Furthermore, whatever rigidity there is in the adoption of a single approach is reduced by the inclusion, in CEAA editions, of the materials out of which texts based on other approaches can be prepared. To call these editions "definitive" may sound dogmatic, but Bowers's definition makes clear that "definitive edition" has come to be a technical term, referring to an edition which includes a text prepared in a particular way along with an apparatus containing certain information. The word "definitive" has undoubtedly been used too freely and unthinkingly and may even at times have been applied loosely, though still incorrectly, to a critical text rather than an edition . If a critical text depends on editorial judgment and critical perception, it cannot be definitive in itself, for judgments and perceptions are always, at least to some extent, arguable. But such a text can be based on a definitive assemblage of relevant material, on painstaking research which, if done properly, does not have to be repeated. 42 No serious student of literature would wish to put a stop to the endless process of rethinking the nuances of a text; but none would desire to repeat the process of accumulating the factual evidence necessary as background for informed judgment if that process had already been satisfactorily completed. A so-called "definitive edition" thus achieves its status through the inclusion of a definitive apparatus; the text presented in such an edition commands respect, because of the thoroughness of the research involved, but it cannot be regarded as the element of the edition which justifies the appellation "definitive." Confusion has arisen because the word "edition" sometimes is used to mean simply "a text" and sometimes refers to a text and its appurtenances. The CEAA, with its dual focus on a rationale for editing and a rationale for presenting evidence, has clearly been aware of these problems and has obviously recognized in its requirements the desirability of encouraging critical thinking about a text by providing the reader with the basic factual information necessary for such thinking. The CEAA's use of Greg's theory, therefore, has perpetuated Greg's recognition of editing as an activity of informed criticism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III When one understands Greg's theory and the CEAA's implementation of it, one cannot help regarding many of the recent discussions (both favorable and unfavorable) of this joint subject as naïve and parochial, and frequently as uninformed or misinformed. 43 A few, however, do raise important issues, and it is regrettable that a survey of these discussions must begin with one of so little substance as that of Edmund Wilson. In a two-part article entitled "The Fruits of the MLA," published in the New York Review of Books on 26 September and 10 October 1968, Wilson offered what can only be called an ill-tempered and incoherent attack on the CEAA editions, making references to six volumes ostensibly under review; 44 in December of that year the article, with a postscript commenting on some of the correspondence provoked by it, 45 was published in pamphlet form as "A New York Review Book," and in 1973 it was collected into the posthumous volume The Devils and Canon Barham (pp. 154-202), edited by Leon Edel. 46 Because of Wilson's stature, this article has received a considerable amount of attention and will continue to have an audience in the future as part of his collected essays; if it had been written by a lesser figure, however, its obvious motivation and manifest confusion would have prevented its being taken seriously. Wilson makes transparent his motive for discrediting the CEAA editions by quoting, at the start, a letter he had written to Jason Epstein in 1962 setting forth the idea of "bringing out in a complete and compact form the principal American classics," based on "the example of the Editions de la Pléiade" (pp. 155-156); this undertaking he had hoped would be supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, but the MLA, he says, "had a project of its own for reprinting the American classics and had apparently had ours suppressed" (p. 159). 47 Thus determined to find fault with the results of the MLA project, Wilson never addresses himself to the basic editorial rationale (that is, to Greg's theory) but instead is content to ridicule such matters as the laboriousness of the research involved, the extent of the apparatus, and the physical size of the volumes. The article is, uncharacteristically, full of confusions, if not inconsistencies, 48 the most egregious perhaps being his professed admiration for a "sound and full text" (p. 157) combined with his view that collation is unrewarding if it does not uncover "serious suppressions and distortions" (p. 161) or interesting variants ("the scrutinizing of variants may, in some cases, be of interest," p. 172). What Wilson is unwilling to acknowledge is that the CEAA's concern extends beyond a scholarly audience to the general public: the CEAA, he says, is "directing a republication of our classics which is not only, for the most part, ill-judged and quite sterile in itself but even obstructive to their republication in any other form" (p. 190). He fails to note that the pages of text, unencumbered in most cases by editorial intrusions, are suitable for photographic reproduction in volumes more convenient to hold and that the apparatus (which, admittedly, helps to make some of the volumes cumbersome), rather than being "sterile," may serve to generate other editions, based on differing evaluations of the evidence—or at least to encourage analysis of the editor's judgments. Wilson's piece scarcely demands any reply, but the celebrity it achieved caused the MLA to feel that some sort of official notice was appropriate, and in March of 1969 the MLA published a pamphlet entitled Professional Standards and American Editions: A Response to Edmund Wilson , containing two accounts of the history and aims of the CEAA, by William M. Gibson and John H. Fisher, along with letters from five scholars enumerating errors or confusions in Wilson's remarks. 49 Actually, all that was necessary, if a reply was to be made, was Gordon Ray's brief comment which stands as the epigraph to the pamphlet. Recognizing that "this attack derives in part from the alarm of amateurs at seeing rigorous professional standards applied to a subject in which they have a vested interest" (and thus recognizing the attraction which Wilson's position had for a number of people one might have expected to see through it), 50 Ray observes, "As the American learned world has come to full maturity since the second World War, a similar animus has shown itself and been discredited in field after field from botany to folklore. In the long run professional standards always prevail." In contrast to Wilson's article, which makes no reference to Greg's theory, two brief essays which appeared soon after it—the work of Paul Baender and Donald Pizer—do raise questions directly about the applicability and usefulness of Greg's "Rationale." Although each of these essays is weakened by a partial misunderstanding of Greg, they at least raise issues the discussion of which may serve to clarify certain points in some people's minds. Baender, an editor associated with a CEAA edition, published in 1969 a note entitled "The Meaning of Copy-Text," 51 which asserts that the term has become "ambiguous and misleading," principally for two reasons: first, that it is a "banner word" which "tends toward the superlative" and which thus implies "authority beyond its denotation, as though the term itself ratified an editor's choice of text"; second, that it is "not suited to the full range and complexity of editorial problems" (p. 312). The first point has nothing to do with the word "copy-text" or the concept but only with unscholarly reactions to it—unscholarly because they depend on the "prestige" (as Baender calls it) of the term rather than the arguments lying behind it. The second is of more consequence but is based on an oversimplification and distortion of Greg's position. If it were accurate to say flatly that Greg's theory is eclectic with respect to substantives but maintains "a single-text criterion" with respect to accidentals (p. 314), or if it were fair to suggest that its application to situations involving prepublication texts results in "another stage for a retrogressive pursuit of copy-text" (p. 316), then one would have grounds for claiming that it is "not suited to the full range and complexity of editorial problems." But nothing in Greg's theory, as we have seen, prohibits the emendation of accidentals in the copy-text when one has grounds for doing so; nor is it consistent with his theory to assume that a surviving manuscript must necessarily—regardless of its nature—become copy-text, since he allowed for the possibility that in some cases a later, rather than an earlier, text is the appropriate choice. One of Baender's illustrations 52 rests on a basic confusion (of which Baender is not alone guilty) between "copy-text" and "printer's copy." Baender cites a situation in which the number of authorial alterations in a later printing makes it more convenient for the editor to use a reproduction of that later printing as the basis for his text, entering onto it the readings of the first printing wherever the later readings are not judged to be authorial. Such a procedure, of course, does not violate Greg's theory (however risky it may be in practical terms, since one is increasing the probability that nonauthorial readings may inadvertently be allowed to remain in the text); but Baender's feeling that one follows the procedure "despite this convention of copy-text" makes clear that he is not focusing on the distinction between "text," meaning a particular arrangement and formal presentation of a group of words, and "printer's copy," meaning a specific physical copy of a text furnished to the printer. Greg's "copy-text" is a "text"—which can exist in more than one physical embodiment (for example, the individual copies of an edition)—and Greg did not comment on the manner in which that text should be reproduced for the use of the compositor who is setting type for the editor's new edition. The CEAA Statement does go on to recommend, for obvious practical reasons, the use of a photographic reproduction of the copy-text as printer's copy; but not to follow this course, whether for convincing or questionable reasons, does not in itself contradict Greg's theory, since no theoretical matter is at issue. 53 Two years later Donald Pizer raised again, 54 but in broader terms, the question of the applicability of Greg's theory to recent literature by enumerating five ways "in which copy-text theory is unresponsive to the distinctive qualities of [that is, the historical circumstances lying behind] modern American texts" (p. 148). 55 Although Pizer calls attention to some issues that deserve careful consideration, his article is ineffective as an argument against the general usefulness of Greg's rationale because it fails to distinguish between theoretical and practical concerns and to recognize fully the lack of dogmatism in Greg's approach. The last three of his points are irrelevant to an analysis of Greg's theory—what they are relevant to is a consideration of the particular kind of edition (in the sense of text plus apparatus or other commentary) appropriate for modern (nineteenth- and twentieth-century) American literature. While this subject is of course a legitimate matter for debate, the issue is only confused by the implication that the adoption of Greg's theory determines the nature of the apparatus (or whatever accompanies the text) as well as of the text itself. Thus his third point—that the multiplicity of manuscripts, typescripts, and proofs which survive for some modern works makes the task of recording all variant readings excessively onerous 56 —presupposes that something in that theory of copy-text necessitates a complete record of variants, for he concludes: "the theory of copy-text either hinders the preparation of critical editions or encourages the production, at immense expense, of unusable editions" (p. 151). But whether or not one wishes to follow the practice of CEAA editions in recording variants (and the CEAA does not require as an absolute rule that all pre-copy-text variants be noted in print) has nothing to do with whether or not one edits a text in accordance with Greg's theory; and naturally the job of editing a reliable text is complicated by the survival of numerous documents, for the variants in them must be examined carefully regardless of whether a listing is to be published. Pizer's fifth point is a related one, dealing also with apparatus: he objects to clear text in a "critical edition" because turning to the back of a book to consult the apparatus is more difficult than looking at the foot of a page, and he disapproves specifically of the sections of apparatus which the reader of a CEAA edition must "juggle" (p. 152). The possibility that a more efficient apparatus can be devised is always open; but the plan of the apparatus does not alter the editorial procedure, and a dislike of "the tendency toward clear-text publication" cannot through any argument become an "objection to copy-text theory." 57 The fourth of Pizer's observations amounts to nothing more than the recognition that some editors may choose to edit works which some readers deem unworthy of the effort expended. He speaks of "the absolutism of copy-text procedures"—meaning the uniform treatment of major and minor works—without acknowledging that the decision to edit is a critical evaluation in itself. Not all the CEAA editions are "complete" editions, and those that are reflect—rather than any requirement of Greg's theory—the critical belief that the stature of the authors involved demands full-scale investigation of even their lesser pieces. 58 Very few people (and certainly not the CEAA) would dissent from the view that—since time and money are not unlimited—"practical editions" must suffice for many literary works; but there will never be complete agreement on exactly what works those are. Pizer's first two objections, in contrast, do raise questions about theory, but not, as he implies, solely about Greg's theory; they are serious questions which any editor must face, whether in the context of Greg's rationale or not. It is Pizer's contention that Greg's theory, by leading an editor normally to adopt the accidentals of a manuscript in preference to those of a first printing, ignores the fact that modern authors sometimes "rely on the taste" of particular publishing-house editors, who thus "have increasingly participated in the creative process of their authors." He argues, in other words, that an author who expects or encourages certain kinds of alterations to be made in the publisher's offices must be said to prefer or "intend" the resulting text. "If an author," as Pizer concisely puts it, "within such a relationship and for whatever motives, accepts an editorial change or suggestion, his acceptance is the equivalent of a creative act, even though the act is the initial responsibility of an editor" (p. 148). The aim of Greg's theory, with which no scholarly editor would quarrel, is to establish the text which the author intended; and by concentrating on unmodernized texts it aims to establish the author's intended text in respect to accidentals as well as substantives. What constitutes the author's "intention" is of course the crucial question, and in answering it the editor must always depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on his critical insight. It is axiomatic that an author's own statements of his intention, when they exist, do not, for a variety of reasons, necessarily coincide with his actual intention—the only guide to which is the work itself. An author may acquiesce in his publisher's decisions and then rationalize his behavior; or he may genuinely be grateful for changes which make his work, in one way or another, more acceptable (and salable) to the public; or he may approve of alterations in many other kinds of situations—without truly believing that the result quite represents his own style or approach. What appears in a prepublication form of a text is normally a better representation of the author's habits than what appears in a first printing, and the text of a fair-copy manuscript or typescript reflects the author's intention, whether or not it turns out to be his final intention in every respect. It is true, as Pizer says, that choosing "an early copy-text encourages a frame of mind which requires later variants to 'prove themselves' as authorial rather than as editorial or printer's variants" (p. 149); but such would seem to be the safest course in most instances, since the author's responsibility for a later reading—especially in accidentals—is normally less certain than his responsibility for an early one. 59 Of course, such editorial caution may occasionally produce a text reflecting "an author's discarded rather than final intentions," but at least it reflects his, rather than someone else's, intentions. The editor's critical judgment—his literary taste exercised in the light of his intimate knowledge of the author and all known relevant external evidence—must finally determine the case; and there is nothing in Greg's theory to prevent him, on this basis, from deciding that the later variants have indeed "proved themselves." If, however, he starts from the assumption that the author and the publisher's editor are creative collaborators, he will, to be sure, produce an unmodernized text—in the sense that it reflects the author's period—but it may be far from the text which the author wished (finally, or at any other time). 60 This question leads to a consideration of eclecticism, and Pizer's second point is that an eclectic text, incorporating later substantive readings into an earlier copy-text, violates the integrity (or "imaginative 'feel,'" as he calls it) of individual stages of an author's work. The result, which "may incorporate changes made by the author over many years," is, he says, "a text which never existed and which has little or no critical interest" (p. 150). Certainly it never existed, for a critical text by definition differs from any single extant documentary form of the text; but whether it is of critical interest depends on how well the editor has performed his task, for his aim is to produce a text which accords with the author's intention more fully than that of any given extant document or printing. The fact that an author may make alterations in a work over a long period of years does not necessarily mean that they reflect different conceptions of that work; when they do, then of course each version should be edited separately as a work in its own right (following the theory of copy-text with regard to each). But surely it blurs a critical distinction to insist that every revision "constitutes a distinctive work with its own aesthetic individuality and character" (p. 149). 61 What this argument leads toward, obviously, is the abandonment of the editor's critical function and the restriction of editing to the production of accurate facsimiles. It is somewhat puzzling that Pizer is reluctant to allow the scholarly editor to attempt a historical reconstruction of the author's intended text, when he is quite ready to believe that contributions of the original publisher's editor were accepted by the author as furthering his intentions. And it is paradoxical that a person who objects to the uniform editing of major and minor works for its failure to make "critical distinctions" ("which is what the study of literature is all about for most scholars and students") should disapprove of texts that involve an editor's critical judgment and should hesitate to offer to the public clear-text editions without apparatus, since they constitute "only the editor's beliefs about the author's final intentions" (p. 152). If, as he recognizes, editing is "in varying degrees an aesthetic enterprise," the "editor's beliefs" command respect to the extent that the editor is at once a careful historian and a sensitive critic; and the existence of insensitive editors casts no more doubt on the undertaking as a whole than the existence of obtuse literary critics does on the activity of literary analysis. When Pizer calls Greg's theory of copy-text "'scientific' in its central impulse" because it "establishes a principle (albeit a flexible one) that is supposed to work in every instance" (p. 153), he disregards the fact that the principle is "flexible" for the very reason that it places no restriction on the operation of informed judgment. In the months following the appearance of Pizer's article, several communications stimulated by it were published in the pages of the same journal. Norman Grabo, in April 1971, and Hershel Parker, at greater length in October, criticized Pizer's position. 62 Then in November John Freehafer, applauding Pizer, set forth what he considered to be three additional "major deficiencies of the CEAA editions." 63 It is significant that the deficiencies are said to be "of the CEAA editions" and not of Greg's theory, for what Freehafer objects to is not Greg's approach but the way it has been put into practice in CEAA editions, along with the decisions reflected in those editions about the kinds of material to be presented. His first two points are patently argumentative: the CEAA editions, he believes, exhibit "a failure to learn from the best editorial practice of the past," because the history of Shakespearean scholarship has shown that the "empty boasts" of an editor like Theobald prove in the long run to be of little substance (whereas critical discussions, like Johnson's, are often of lasting value); and they demonstrate "a failure to present literary works as such" by not providing critical analyses 64 and explanatory notes, by being "almost totally concerned with bibliographical questions." The first point springs from the CEAA use of the word "definitive." As I have said before, this word was an ill-advised choice and has been too freely used; nevertheless, it should be clear to any reader of a CEAA apparatus, from its discussion of various problematical points, that CEAA editors are not claiming (nor did Greg expect editors following his rationale to be able to claim) that they have made all the right decisions and thus produced a "definitive" text; all they can aim for as a goal is to provide a definitive apparatus, recognizing that it is at least possible sometimes to establish facts. The decision to emphasize the history of the text (including the history of critical reaction to it) in CEAA introductions and afterwords is obviously related to this point, for those essays constitute another part of the apparatus, directed toward laying out what historical facts can be established. 65 That these editions are historically oriented, however, does not mean that they fail "to present literary works as such" but simply that they do not present literary works accompanied by any one critical interpretation. 66 Freehafer's third point, however, raises an issue which deserves to be commented upon, even though what must be said is implicit in Greg's theory and will therefore seem redundant to some readers. He complains that the CEAA editions have failed "to use Greg's theory of copy-text with sufficient boldness and imagination to reconstruct ideal authorial texts of many of the works being edited" (p. 419). In support of this proposition he cites the differences in the texture of accidentals between The Scarlet Letter and The House of the Seven Gables in the Ohio State edition, resulting from the fact that copy-text for the former is a first printing (the manuscript not having survived) and for the latter is a manuscript; these differences, he says, can be regarded as "valid reconstructions of the author's intentions . . . only on the incredible supposition that within a year Hawthorne turned from a passionate devotion to house-styling to a passionate rejection of it" (p. 422). What this argument fails to notice is that Greg's theory, as a scholarly procedure, must operate on the basis of the available materials for a given text and aims at reconstructing the author's intention insofar as surviving evidence permits. One can well believe, with Freehafer, that Hawthorne's preferences did not shift so drastically within a year. But can one therefore say that the features of one known manuscript would also have been those of another, now missing, manuscript from approximately the same time, and that an editor would on that basis know how to set about inserting those features into the text for which no manuscript survives? Answering No could perhaps be called unimaginative, but one should then add that to be more "imaginative" would be inconsistent with the scholarly goal of exercising critical judgment within the bounds set by ascertainable fact and documentary evidence. The belief that the accidentals in one CEAA text should be identical to those in another contemporary text by the same author stems from an assumption that the CEAA goal is to reconstruct the author's "intention" in an absolute sense, rather than in the more realistic sense of that intention for which there is documentary evidence for a particular work. Naturally the editor's knowledge of the author's practice in other works, for which a different range of documents exists, ought to play a role in any decision he makes; but it would be a rare instance indeed in which such knowledge was so certain and comprehensive that the editor could feel confident in his ability to repunctuate or respell for the author without introducing far more readings that never existed than those that did. Anyone who wishes to take a more "imaginative" approach and to interpolate the habits of one manuscript or a group of manuscripts into the texts of other works would of course be able to examine and utilize the evidence present in the texts and apparatuses of the relevant CEAA volumes. A second illustration of Freehafer's is again indicative of a fundamental misunderstanding of what kind of text the CEAA is attempting to provide. Turning to a different period, he cites two recent editions of Dryden's The Indian Emperour (one in the University of California Press Works , 1966, and the other in the University of Chicago Four Tragedies , 1967) and observes that, by selecting two different copy-texts, these editions present, even after editing, two very different texts. Since both attempt to reconstruct the author's intention, both should theoretically, he says, "have arrived at identical texts" which "agree word for word, letter for letter, comma for comma" (p. 422); that they do not so agree he attributes to an unimaginative use of Greg's theory, to "tyranny of the copy-text." But Greg, precisely because he recognized the role of imagination and judgment, would never have expected two editors to make all the same choices and emerge with identical texts. What the scholarly editor is striving to do is to put his critical judgment at the service of recognizing what the author intended, and no one, including the CEAA editors, would claim that any one attempt at this is the final or "definitive" one. Freehafer's urging of a more imaginative use of Greg's rationale to produce an "author's ideal text" seems rather at odds with his criticism of the Ohio State Hawthorne, both here and in an earlier detailed discussion of The Marble Faun , 67 for making too many emendations; the existence of arguable emendations and variants suggests the impossibility of universal agreement on critical issues, and a more imaginative approach would not be likely to lessen the range of disagreement. Several times Freehafer speaks of "definitive texts"—not "definitive editions"—and in that earlier essay says that how definitive the Hawthorne edition is "largely depends upon how the editors have used their collations, concordances, and other data in establishing Hawthorne's texts" (p. 487); however, the distinction between a "critical" text and a "definitive" edition (which embodies such a text along with other information) cannot be overlooked if debates about these matters are to get anywhere. Pizer, too, in his response in December 1971 to Grabo and Parker, 68 reiterated the need for "flexibility" and for resistance to "the tidy and neat," apparently without recognizing that CEAA critical texts and their apparatuses reflect those qualities. The same month saw the appearance of the first volume of Proof , which contained a long essay by Morse Peckham, "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing." 69 Peckham is the only critic of Greg's theory thus far to explain his criticisms in the context of a thoughtfully developed analysis of the nature of human communication. Most of the previous comments, as we have noticed, either arose from a misunderstanding of Greg or dealt with largely superficial matters; Peckham, on the other hand, attacks Greg's central assumptions by setting forth a view of human behavior incompatible with them. Although I shall try to show why his argument does not seem to me to invalidate Greg's rationale, I hope it will be clear, at the same time, that Peckham is raising the kind of fundamental questions that have been too little discussed. His essay—aside from its examination of whether analytical bibliography can be regarded as "scientific" 70 —attacks Greg's theory in two respects: (1) it denies that substantives and accidentals can be meaningfully segregated; (2) it denies that the reconstruction of a text representing the author's intention is a meaningful (or attainable) goal. Although the argument supporting the first can be seen as consistent with and deriving from the larger propositions underlying the second, the first point can be taken up separately and is discussed first by Peckham. The distinction between substantives and accidentals, Peckham says, was necessary to Greg because of the nature of the material he was dealing with: "the sparse and inconsistent punctuation in [Renaissance] dramatic manuscripts that have survived " (p. 124). 71 But, he adds, the distinction "is useless outside of his very special class of texts" (p. 125), because most later authors (and some Elizabethans as well) were aware that punctuation affects meaning and were not helpless victims of a house-style imposed by their publishers. Punctuation, he argues, does more than affect meaning, for, without punctuation, "it is frequently impossible to decide on that meaning": Punctuation is not a form or dress of substantives, something different from words. It is part of speech. Juncture, pitch, and stress are inseparable components in the semantic continuum of the spoken language. Their signs are punctuation. (p. 124) Thus "an educated author produces his punctuation as he produces his words; together they make up an unbroken semantic continuum." Clearly Peckham is correct in believing that no fixed line separates punctuation (or other "accidentals") from wording in the expression of meaning; and I am not aware of any editor who accepts Greg that would take issue with this point. But it does not therefore follow that no practical distinction can be made between them. Greg, of course, insisted that he was concerned with a "practical," not a "philosophic," distinction; but Peckham finds illogical (because it does seem to claim a "philosophic" basis for the distinction) Greg's footnote in the "Rationale" which asserts that punctuation "remains properly a matter of presentation," despite the fact that it can affect meaning. Now that footnote, it must be admitted, is not written with Greg's characteristic clarity, but the point he was getting at (as the drift of his whole essay suggests) is not, in my opinion, illogical. A paraphrase might go something like this: "Although punctuation and spelling are, from a theoretical (or 'philosophic') point of view, inseparable from words in the written expression of meaning, in practice people (i.e., scribes, compositors, and even authors at times) do react to them as if they were somehow less significant." What Greg meant by a "practical" distinction is one which, however mistaken it may be, has in fact operated to govern human behavior; and, since the editor is concerned with analyzing the behavior of certain individuals, such a distinction may be useful to him. It is certainly true, as Peckham later points out (p. 145), that Elizabethan compositors felt freer to depart from the punctuation and spelling of their copy than later compositors. But does not a modern publisher's editor generally feel less compunction about inserting a comma than altering a word? Does not the author who acquiesces to a suggested change of punctuation more readily than to one of wording, or who believes that his punctuation but not his diction actually demands revision, feel that there is some sort of distinction? So long as one can say, "I think my quotation is accurate, though it may differ in a mark of punctuation here and there," and not be regarded by most people as uttering nonsense, one can believe that a "practical" distinction between the two does widely exist in people's minds. To the extent that punctuation and spelling are popularly regarded as distinct from what is being said—and it scarcely requires demonstration that they are, and have been, so regarded—the transmission of texts is correspondingly affected. However much an editor may deplore the confusion behind this attitude (analogous to the popular oversimplification of the relation between form and content), it is his business to take into account, as realistically as he can, the factors that influence textual transmission. (Of course, some accidentals do have less effect upon meaning than others: a comma marking a phrase-ending that would be recognized even without the comma serves less purpose than one which marks the beginning of a nonrestrictive clause. But no definite line separates this second type of accidental, sometimes called "semi-substantives," from the first, which also, though more subtly, may affect the sense.) What I take Greg to be saying, then, is that the editor distinguishes substantives and accidentals not because he believes that he is making a valid conceptual distinction between two elements in written language but because the distinction is one which is likely to have been made by the persons who have been involved in the transmission of any given text (and which therefore may be useful in segregating different features of that text which may have been accorded different treatment). Obviously Greg does not expect an editor to be bound by this distinction in his own thinking, for he makes no requirement that the editor always accept the accidentals of a first edition or that he always accept all the accidentals of whatever text he selects as copy-text. He merely observes that, given the popular tendency to be less careful with accidentals than with substantives, more of the author's accidentals are likely to be present in a first edition than in later editions. And, of course, the whole point of attempting to recover the author's accidentals is that they do indeed constitute an important part of his expression. The distinction between substantives and accidentals has no influence on what an editor decides to do when he believes that he has convincing reasons for doing a particular thing, 72 but when he does not have such reasons, the distinction enables him to make a decision in accord with what common experience shows to be a widespread attitude (one which is thus likely to have been operative in any given instance). 73 Although English spelling has become more fixed over the centuries and styles of punctuation have altered, I see no evidence that the popular conception of spelling and punctuation as the accouterments of words has shifted 74 —or any reason, therefore, not to find Greg's approach applicable to later writings. Greg's choice of the terms "substantive" and "accidental" was, as I have said before, unfortunate, and the fun which Peckham has with them, calling them "strangely medieval," is deserved; there would have been fewer misunderstandings (and certainly fewer complaints about unnecessary jargon) if, as Peckham suggests, plain terms like "words," "punctuation," and "spelling" had been employed. But surely the point Greg was getting at is not completely hidden behind the terms he chose. 75 Peckham's principal argument, however, deals not with accidentals but with the concepts of "text" and "author." He believes that many literary scholars—including Greg and his followers, who attempt to establish the author's intended text—are guilty of literary hagiolatry, exalting the ideas of "author" and "work of art" in ways not consistent with the nature of human communication. An author, he says, is simply an organism which produces utterances, not as a result of any special inspiration but as a result of being human: A writer produces utterances because he is a human being. It is a condition of being human. We do not know why human beings produce utterances, nor even how. It is a primitive, or surd, with which we begin and, to make matters worse, within which we must operate. To talk about self-expression, or projections, or mental ideas being expressed in language, is at worst to cover up our ignorance with pseudo-explanations, and at best to use a verbal category to subsume the production of language and the production of nonverbal behavior. (p. 139) But the author is different from other utterers in that he assembles a series of utterances into what "he judges to be a discourse" and makes this series available to others, proposing "that they too judge it to be a discourse" (p. 138). The development of the discourse up to that point has involved a combination of producing utterances and changing (or revising) them; 76 thus the author, even before his work becomes public, has already been in the position of looking back over something previously written, reacting to it as a reader, since he is not at that moment the producer. This process, Peckham argues, continues indefinitely: sometimes other human beings (such as publishers' editors) react to and change the discourse, and sometimes the author continues to change it. Each is responding to a particular version, and each "can make a change acceptable to the author or to anyone else involved" (p. 141). The "textual editor" is but one more human organism in this sequence, producing one more version of "a postulated work, that is, of a construct" (p. 128). Whether a valid distinction can be made between changes by the author and by others, therefore, turns on the question of whether the author is an organism engaged in the production of utterances, an activity which as a human organism he cannot avoid, even when alone and engaged in covert utterance, or whether he is an individual. So far there have appeared no grounds, save linguistic hypostatization and literary hagiolatry, for considering him an individual. The notion to be understood here is that he is but an organism and not an individual or monad or entity which can be differentiated from other similar entities. (p. 143) As a result, one cannot speak meaningfully of a single ideal "text" of a work; if the development of the concept of individuality ("self-mediated divergence from a cultural norm") had not caused the editor to confer "sainthood" on the supposed "author" and exalt certain works as canonical (p. 149), he would realize that he is "simply continuing an activity initiated by the author" (p. 144). Although this is a greatly simplified summary of Peckham's analysis, I think that it does not distort the main outlines of his position. But one does not have to disagree with this general position in order to believe that such editors as those of the CEAA volumes are pursuing a sensible, meaningful, and useful goal. The "textual editor" whom Peckham describes—he defines the term as subsuming "both analytical bibliographer and textual critic" (p. 141) —is naturally, in Peckham's general terms, just another person making changes in a text; but it would seem to be more illuminating to go on and note how he is to be distinguished from others who do that. For persons who make changes in pieces of writing—and are admittedly engaging in basically similar actions—fall into two groups, those performing scholarly editing and those performing what may be called "creative editing." 77 There is no reason why one cannot regard a piece of writing as the common product of all beings who have come in contact with it and reacted to it; when it is viewed in this way, any change, made at any time, whether by the original publisher's editor, by the author, or by a later "editor," has the same status and may be judged to have improved the work, harmed it, or left it the same. From this point of view a critic is not performing his function conscientiously if he does not alter the work to make it, according to his standards, more satisfying than it has ever been before. There is, as I say, no objection to this procedure—so long as one's goal is critically rather than historically oriented. But the scholar sets a goal of historical reconstruction. 78 That the "author" has some individuality is suggested, even in Peckham's approach, by the recognition that he initiated the discourse, which is then operated upon by himself and others. If that discourse is of sufficient interest, a historical interest may also attach to the initiator; and if the same being initiates a number of such discourses, the interest may be correspondingly greater. What the scholarly editor attempts—recognizing the difficulty of the task and even the impossibility of its absolute achievement—is to remove from the discourse those features for which the initiator was not responsible. 79 The result is not necessarily what the editor himself prefers but what he believes to be the author's contribution to a given discourse. The scholarly editor is thus a different kind of responder from the others in the chain Peckham is talking about; it may be that the editor, if he lives in the mid-twentieth century, cannot avoid reacting in part in mid-twentieth-century terms, but his aim is to use his critical faculties 80 to place himself in the frame of reference of the author and the author's environment. That such an aim is impossible of full attainment does not invalidate it as a guideline for a direction in which to move, despite Peckham's labeling of this attitude as "pure hagiolatry" (p. 138). 81 The difficulty with accepting Peckham's statement of the case is evident when he remarks that the concepts of "text" and "author" require the "textual editor" to "produce a definitive edition, which he cannot do, instead of producing a new version more satisfactory for some specific purpose than any existing version, which he can do" (p. 151). What Peckham says the editor can do is in fact what CEAA editors do (and realize they are doing): they produce a critical (not definitive) text which they believe to be more satisfactory for the purpose of the historical study of literature than any previous text, and they regard the edition embodying that text as "definitive" only in its recording of certain classes of data. Part of the problem, throughout the essay, is Peckham's interchangeable use of "text" and "edition" and his belief that CEAA editors really think they are producing definitive texts . 82 Perhaps, indeed, this is the fundamental problem, for his concluding section (pp. 153-155), recognizing that the "textual editor" may decide to produce a text representing any given stage in the history of a work, goes on to assert, "No misplaced confidence in inadequately based theory can justify his evasion of the problems of an empirical situation." But when one observes that Greg's approach is an attempt to confront the empirical realities involved in the reconstruction of a particular stage in the history of a work and that it does not proclaim the result to be the only useful text of the work (even for historical study), the issue Peckham raises is no longer an issue. It seems to me that Peckham's final description of "the task of the textual editor" is—after one has penetrated the vocabulary—accurate: to produce a new version from a series of a postulated text by a postulated author by making up for the policing, validating, and changing deficiencies in the long, complex, and interlocking series of behaviors the consequence of which was the production of that series. (p. 155) But when he proceeds to say that there is no definitive version to be arrived at and "no one set of instructions" to follow, he is responding to a nonexistent argument. Much of Peckham's essay helpfully focuses on the nature of written language, and his suggestion that editors ought to be aware of the nonliterary uses to which their apparatuses can be put (as in a study of human behavior) is worth serious consideration; but as a critique of Greg's "Rationale" and the CEAA editions, it misses the mark. During the following year (1972) there appeared two books with general-sounding, but somewhat misleading, titles, James Thorpe's Principles of Textual Criticism and Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography . Each raises some questions, either explicitly or implicitly, about the validity of CEAA procedures—questions which, by this time, seem very familar. Thorpe's most direct comment on the CEAA—a brief discussion of its Statement —is related to his underlying belief that textual criticism has become too bibliographical in approach and that bibliographers are trying to make textual criticism a "science." Despite his assemblage of quotations intended to serve as background, these issues are in fact illusory: for the leading bibliographers over the years have recognized that textual criticism can never be mechanical and that bibliography is simply one tool among several useful in dealing with textual problems. 83 Thorpe paints a picture of bibliographers greedy to annex the whole "province of textual criticism," as he calls it; but whether the present emphasis of textual criticism is excessively bibliographical is a question that cannot be approached in general or theoretical terms but only in relation to the details of specific situations. After all, if bibliography offers one kind of evidence to the textual critic, he cannot sensibly say that he desires only so much, and no more, of that kind of evidence; but if his attention to those details causes him in a particular case to neglect his search for letters or documents or other kinds of external evidence, then obviously he can be criticized in that instance for undue concentration on one type of evidence. What Thorpe tries to argue, however, is that the CEAA Statement , by requiring attention to bibliographical details, implies such attention to be "the efficient cause of an ideal edition" (p. 72). 84 The Statement , he believes, reflects "the view of a text as a system of infinitely perfectible details, by which scrupulous attention to all details will ultimately yield ideal results" (p. 57). Although he does not wish "to suggest that meticulous care is pedantry" (p. 76), he does suggest that close analysis of what seem to be unimportant variants is a waste of time (e.g., p. 74). He does not acknowledge the fact that laborious collation of texts 85 and analysis of variants accomplish just as much when they demonstrate the absence of significant variants—or the presence of variants only in "the relatively trivial matters of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization" (p. 51) 86 —as when they show the existence of dramatically different readings. And no editor that I have heard of ever claimed that "scrupulous attention" to details and "meticulous care" are "a complete substitute for intelligence and common sense" (p. 78). 87 One must agree with Thorpe's later insistence (pp. 179-183) on the importance of a thorough knowledge of the author's works and period and of a diligent search for external evidence. But there is nothing inherent in the attention to bibliographical detail which prevents an editor from giving attention to other essential matters. The CEAA Statement does set forth the importance of accuracy in collating and proofreading, but it also points out the necessity for knowing the author's works and for searching out all relevant documents bearing on the history of a text 88 —and the CEAA editions have repeatedly been responsible for the uncovering of new documents and the assembling of comprehensive collections of reference material. An editor who neglects any part of his duty is open to criticism, and Thorpe's conclusion that editors should exploit "every kind of relevant evidence" (p. 79) is unexceptionable; but his belief that the "strongly bibliographical cast" (p. 103) of the CEAA Statement leads to a "glorification of method" (p. 79) rests on the fallacious assumption that attention to one kind of detail necessarily involves the neglect of other kinds. Some editors may of course be guilty of neglecting evidence, but it seems perverse to search for the cause of their incompetence in their careful attention to one kind of relevant detail. A more consequential matter which Thorpe takes up is the treatment of accidentals (pp. 131-170). 89 After providing a sampling of statements from authors of various periods, stressing their indifference to accidentals, and a historical survey of printers' manuals, suggesting that printers over the years have felt an obligation to "correct" accidentals, Thorpe concludes that "probably in most cases" the author "expected the printer to perfect his accidentals" and that therefore "the changes introduced by the printer can be properly thought of as fulfilling the writer's intentions" (p. 165). It seems to me that there are two basic difficulties with Thorpe's position. The first is that quotations from authors and from printers' manuals are not comparable, because the former are statements of personal opinion (often prompted by specific situations), while the latter are public announcements of recommended general practice. Thus Thorpe's evidence from the printers' manuals 90 is sufficient to show that printers have widely regarded the alteration of accidentals in copy as part of their function; but his evidence from individual writers by no means can be generalized upon to suggest that in any given instance the chances favor an author's having been indifferent to the handling of accidentals. The conclusion would seem to follow—contrary to Thorpe—that, without convincing evidence on the other side, an author's manuscript stands a better chance of reflecting his wishes in accidentals than does a printed text. Here the second difficulty arises—in Thorpe's conception of an author's "intention." In his opening chapter—his well-known essay on "The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism" 91 —he asserts, "While the author cannot dictate the meaning of the text, he certainly has final authority over which words constitute the text of his literary work" (p. 10). As a result of this distinction between "meaning" and "words," Thorpe tends to accept at face value an author's statement about wording, without focusing on the fact that the motivations influencing such a statement may be just as complex as those lying behind a statement of intended "meaning." Although he recognizes that, in the absence of an authorial statement, the intended wording must be arrived at through a critical analysis of all available evidence (p. 193), at various points he implies that the existence of a statement settles the matter—as when he says that "the personal testimony by the author as to his intentions is plainly the most primary textual evidence that there can be" (p. 109). 92 This point of view leads to an uncritical acceptance of an author's remarks about his indifference to accidentals (or his preference for those in the printed text). The upshot of Thorpe's discussion is his astonishing recommendation that "the editor will do best to spend only a modest amount of his time on accidentals—mainly a losing cause—and devote himself to matters of substance" (p. 168). It is difficult to reconcile Thorpe's readiness to believe that an author preferred the printer's accidentals with his strict view of "the integrity of the work of art" (pp. 14-32); and it is hard to see how an editor whose aim is to establish the author's intended text, in accidentals as well as in substantives, 93 can justify the decision in advance to spend a "modest" amount of time on the accidentals. Like the earlier discussion of bibliographical detail, this chapter on accidentals reflects a peculiar view of scholarly endeavor: it suggests, in effect, that a scholar's sense of perspective is shown less by his ability to evaluate and integrate data than by his prior decision to limit his consideration of certain clearly relevant areas. 94 If Thorpe's book, weakened by such contradictions, does not manage to serve the useful function of fairly surveying "the basic principles which underlie the practice of textual criticism" (p. vii), neither does Philip Gaskell's chapter on "Textual Bibliography" (pp. 336-360) in A New Introduction to Bibliography provide the kind of basic summary of current thinking which one might expect of an "introduction." Although his exposition of "Copy-Text" (pp. 338-343) does not specifically mention Greg's rationale, he does provide an accurate statement of its general application, with one important exception. 95 He is unwilling to push that rationale to its logical conclusion and recognize that a fair-copy manuscript, when it survives, becomes the copy-text, except when there is convincing evidence pointing toward the first (or some later) edition as the proper choice. 96 His argument rests on the same assumption as Thorpe's: Most authors, in fact, expect their spelling, capitalization, and punctuation to be corrected or supplied by the printer, relying on the process to dress the text suitably for publication, implicitly endorsing it (with or without further amendment) when correcting proofs. (p. 339) He concludes that it "would normally be wrong, therefore, rigidly 97 to follow the accidentals of the manuscript, which the author would himself have been prepared—or might have preferred—to discard" and asserts that "in most cases the editor will choose as copy-text an early printed edition, not the manuscript" (p. 340). Later, he reiterates that "the manuscript if it survives, will be consulted but will not be followed in accidentals unless the compositor appears to have misrepresented the author's intentions" (p. 358). Although he allows for situations in which the manuscript is the proper choice, he places the presumption of authority with the first printed text. I have already commented on the difficulties of maintaining such a position, but I should perhaps call attention to the way in which Gaskell's wording itself reveals some of them. To say that an author is "implicitly endorsing" the accidentals of the proofs when he lets them stand is not at all the same as to say that he prefers them, and it ignores the economic (and other) factors which may have influenced his decision; similarly, to believe that an author "would himself have been prepared . . . to discard" the accidentals of his manuscript is not the same as to believe that he wished to discard them, and it surely does not give an editor license to carry out that discarding. Gaskell asserts that the accidentals of a first edition, despite "the process of normalization carried out in the printing house," will "still be closer both to the text that the author wanted, and to the reading of his manuscript, than the altered accidentals of the second and third editions" (p. 340). This statement is true, but the reference to manuscript readings undermines the general argument: if there is any desirability in having the accidentals resemble those of the manuscript, then the manuscript ought to be chosen for copy-text in the first place; on the other hand, if the author's preference is for the first-edition readings, then the manuscript is irrelevant in this context. Gaskell raises further doubts in the reader's mind by citing the example of Thomas Hardy, who, "in revising his printed texts for new editions, appears to have changed the normalized accidentals back to the forms of the original manuscript" (p. 342). Even though Hardy may not be a typical case, his revision illustrates the point that a writer may acquiesce in printing- or publishing-house styling without preferring it. Is not the more reasonable approach, then, to presume, until contrary evidence is adduced, that a manuscript reflects the author's intentions in accidentals, rather than to begin with the presumption that it does not? A further confusion is introduced by the argument that an author's accidentals may stand in need of correction. Gaskell doubts "whether it is worth preserving thoroughly bad punctuation just because it is the author's" (p. 358) and later advises, "Let us carry out the author's intentions wherever we can, but not to the extent of taking pride in reproducing the manifest inadequacies of his accidentals" (p. 359). But punctuation which seems "bad" to the editor may have seemed appropriate to the author; and if the editor's aim is to preserve what the author wrote, rather than his own "improvements" upon it, he cannot very well say that he will pursue the author's intention only up to a point, and no farther. Gaskell's belief that "an editor may reasonably aim at consistency in his final version" (p. 358) suggests that he is thinking of a modernized text, 98 although most of his comments seem to be concerned with editions that aim to recover the author's intentions. At any rate, it is true that his discussion never focuses on the differences in purpose between modernized and unmodernized texts: Printed accidentals are unlikely to have had more than the general approval of the author, and if they seem to be both unsatisfactory and in contravention of the author's usual practice, the editor will have to emend them. (Whether he will emend them according to the conventions of the author's period or to those of his own is something else which he will have to decide.) (p. 360) The illogic of this passage results from the fact that two kinds of editions are being talked about simultaneously. Since "unsatisfactory" accidentals may not be "in contravention of the author's usual practice," the editor is being instructed here to emend only those "unsatisfactory" accidentals which are not characteristic of the author, thus producing a partially regularized, but not modernized, text. But when he has done that, he does not still have open to him the option of emending "according to the conventions . . . of his own" period—that is, of modernizing. After all, there would be no point in selecting the readings in need of emendation on the basis of whether they are uncharacteristic of the author and then to emend them on the basis of present-day practice. Either the editor decides to establish, as accurately as he can, the author's own accidentals; or he decides to make all the accidentals conform to the practice of his own time. The fact that the former approach is necessary for scholarly (that is, historical) study does not, of course, mean that there may not be occasions on which the latter is more appropriate. But the failure to distinguish carefully between the two cannot lead to clear thinking about editorial problems. It is unfortunate that Gaskell's discussion gives the impression of describing (as one would expect an "introduction" to describe) current generally accepted practice; beginners who turn to it for guidance will be puzzled and misled. 99 This account of the CEAA's application of Greg's rationale to American literature and of the critical reaction to it suggests several observations. To begin with, one must recognize that, when Wilson expressed surprise at the "violence and venom" of the correspondence aroused by his article, he was calling attention to characteristics which have unfortunately been manifested by a number of persons in this debate, on both sides. It may be gratifying to some editors to find that people care enough about editing to become emotionally involved in theoretical discussions, but scholarship is not advanced by arguments which rest on preconceptions or vested interests or clashes of personality. There can be no doubt that some of this debate has sunk to that level, and the opponents of CEAA policy are not the only ones at fault. What is particularly unfortunate is that so much time and energy has been poured into arguments about superficial or nonexistent issues, when there are so many issues of importance that remain to be considered. The belief that bibliographical and textual work is not humanistic simply because it tries to establish facts or utilizes mechanical aids—and that those engaged in it therefore do not really care about literature—is obviously an emotional rallying cry, not a proposition to be seriously entertained. Similarly, the view that editors who follow Greg are engaged in a mysterious, complex procedure with an elaborate, arcane terminology can only be regarded as an invention of those who are temperamentally disinclined to perform editorial work, for it would be uncharitable to believe that they actually find these concepts and terms a strain on the intelligence. As emotional reactions, these attitudes are understandable, and proponents of Greg's theory have sometimes done their part to provoke them; but as intellectual arguments, there is simply nothing to them. I am not suggesting that the entire controversy has been frivolous; but even the more serious arguments have so often resulted from a misunderstanding of what is really an uncomplicated approach that one is puzzled to account for them in any but emotional terms. Neither am I saying that Greg's theory and the CEAA application of it ought not to be criticized and analyzed, for any serious intellectual position can only benefit from thoughtful constructive criticism. The point, indeed, is that there has been too little—scarcely any—of this kind of criticism. Yet much of fundamental importance remains to be thought about. The question of what is meant by authorial intention, of how that intention affects the treatment of punctuation, of what differences may be required in working with a typescript rather than a holograph manuscript—such matters as these, when disentangled from self-serving attacks on or defenses of particular editions, need more discussion. Now that a considerable interest in editorial matters has been aroused, a great deal can be accomplished if the collective effort of those interested is expended constructively. No one pretends to have solved all the problems, but solutions can best be approached by a positive effort to understand what accomplishments have so far been achieved and to build on them. Presumably all readers are interested in seeing reliable texts of American literary works made widely available; it would be unfortunate if those who share a common goal allowed themselves to be diverted by controversy from keeping that goal at the center of their attention and working together to attain it. 100</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Presenting the work of twelve authors: Cooper, Stephen Crane, John Dewey, Emerson, Hawthorne, Howells, Irving, Melville, Simms, Thoreau, Mark Twain, and Whitman. 2 A more detailed account of the history of the CEAA can be found in William M. Gibson's "The Center for Editions of American Authors" and in John H. Fisher's "The MLA Editions of Major American Authors" (and the chronology which follows it) in Professional Standards and American Editions: A Response to Edmund Wilson (Modern Language Association, 1969), pp. 1-6, 20-28. A survey of editions in progress and proposed editions at the time of the inception of the CEAA (and based on the 1962 discussions) is provided by William M. Gibson and Edwin H. Cady in "Editions of American Writers, 1963: A Preliminary Survey," PMLA , 78 (September 1963, part 2), 1-8 (reprinted in an MLA pamphlet, The Situation of English , 1963 ); another essay useful for background relating to the inception of the CEAA is Willard Thorp's "Exodus: Four Decades of American Literary Scholarship," MLQ , 26 (1965), 40-61. 3 A convenient record of the books and articles related to CEAA editorial theory and practice is provided as an appendix (entitled "Relevant Textual Scholarship") to the CEAA Statement (2nd ed., 1972), pp. 17-25. 4 The added footnote, enclosed in brackets on p. 382 of The Collected Papers , is the one which attributes the phrase "the tyranny of the copy-text" to Paul Maas. (He used it in his review of Greg's The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , RES , 20 [1944], 76; Greg's reaction appears on pp. 159-160 of the same volume.) The 1966 text also adds the second "are" to "what readings are possible and what are not" at 381.31; it inserts the comma in "In the folio, revision and reproduction are so blended" at 390.32; and it adds the clause set off by commas in the statement that "the quartos contain, it is generally assumed, only reported texts" at 391.19. Another difference in the 1966 text is an error: in the quotation from McKerrow's Prolegomena at 380.32, "what we call inner harmony" ought to read "what we may call inner harmony," as it did in the original SB printing. As one would expect, the essay has been included in anthologies: Bibliography and Textual Criticism , ed. O M Brack, Jr., and Warner Barnes (1969), pp. 41-58; Art and Error , ed. Ronald Gottesman and Scott Bennett (1970), pp. 17-36. Both of these anthologies reprint the SB text rather than the text from The Collected Papers . 5 Greg himself calls attention in a footnote (p. 378) to the fact that McKerrow used the word "substantive" to refer to "an edition that is not a reprint of any other," and he adds, "I do not think that there should be any danger of confusion between 'substantive editions' and 'substantive readings.'" Nevertheless, it is unfortunate that the word should be given two special meanings in editorial discourse. The awkwardness of "accidental" (when it is not used as a plural noun, "accidentals") is obvious and is in fact demonstrated by Greg's own prose a few lines after his introduction of the term: "As regards substantive readings . . . they will doubtless sometimes depart from them accidentally and may even . . . do so intentionally: as regards accidentals, they will normally follow their own habits . . ." (pp. 376-377). Furthermore, since both terms are used by grammarians, one might at first suppose that editors, also concerned with language, might use them in the same way; but "substantive" in grammar means "noun" (which is a less inclusive concept than Greg's "substantive"), while "accident" (or "accidence") refers to inflection for case, number, tense, and so on (which is not "accidental" alteration in Greg's sense but rather falls within the scope of "substantive" changes). Perhaps the closest parallel is the use of "substance" and "accident" in philosophy to signify the essential and the nonessential; yet Greg insists, rightly, that his concern is not with a philosophical distinction. (Greg had used the word "accidents" in 1942 in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , where one section is entitled, "Note on Accidental Characteristics of the Text," pp. l-lv; but instead of "substantives" the term "essentials of reading" is employed.) 6 After defining the two terms (p. 376), he says in the body of his text, "The distinction is not arbitrary or theoretical, but has an immediate bearing on textual criticism"; and in a footnote to the definitions he emphasizes, "The distinction I am trying to draw is practical, not philosophic." See also footnote 12 below. 7 Although Greg does not say so here, McKerrow's attitude doubtless sprang from his overreacting against the abuses of some nineteenth-century editors, who felt free to choose among variant readings without adequate study of the nature and origin of the editions in which those variants appeared. Later Greg does make a similar point in general terms: "The attitude may be explained historically as a natural and largely salutary reaction against the methods of earlier editors. Dissatisfied with the results of eclectic freedom and reliance on personal taste, critics sought to establish some sort of mechanical apparatus for dealing with textual problems . . ." (p. 383). For a development of this point, see Fredson Bowers, "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," SQ , 6 (1955), 309-324; and "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), esp. 90-91. 8 Greg did not move all at once to his final position. In "McKerrow's Prolegomena Reconsidered," RES , 17 (1941), 139-149, and, more fully, in the Prolegomena to The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942), he recognized the unnecessary rigidity of McKerrow's insistence on adopting all the substantive variants from an edition which contains some authorial revisions, but he followed McKerrow's inclusion of "wording" as one of the criteria for choosing a copy-text. By the end of the decade, however, in this "Rationale," he had developed his distinction between substantives and accidentals and therefore admitted in a footnote, "There is a good deal in my Prolegomena that I should now express differently, and on this particular point I have definitely changed my opinion. I should now say that the choice of the copy-text depends solely on its formal features (accidentals)" (p. 386). In making revisions in 1950 of The Editorial Problem , he added a new preface repeating this point and referring to the "Rationale" essay. 9 More than once Greg calls attention to McKerrow's use of the word "reprint" for "critical edition" (e.g., pp. 379, 380). "Reprint," of course, implies complete absence of editorial interference; but while McKerrow expects an editor to use critical judgment in correcting obviously impossible readings he does not conceive of the result as a "critical edition." Greg calls this confusion "symptomatic"—that is, of McKerrow's pervasive reluctance to give rein to individual judgment. 10 The examples are effective in demonstrating not only undue reliance on the copy-text but also the self-confidence required to alter the copy-text, and in both instances Greg perhaps overstates the obviousness of the emendations he proposes. His arguments for emending the copy-text in each case are persuasive; but the larger argument of his essay does not require him to assert that these emendations are in fact correct but only to show that an editor ought not to be prevented from seriously considering them by too rigid an adherence to the copy-text. It is one thing to say that Boas and Simpson might have adopted his emendations if they had not been under the tyranny of the copy-text, but quite another to imply that they certainly would have done so. 11 Johnson on Shakespeare , ed. Arthur Sherbo (1968), I, 106. 12 It should be clear that there is no contradiction involved between the assertion that Greg is dealing with a concept and his own repeated emphasis on the practical rather than the theoretical. Obviously, as the word "rationale" in his title suggests, his argument is conceptual and theoretical, since it attempts to formulate a general statement which can be illustrated by reference to specific situations. But the theory itself is proposed as a matter of expediency, as a workable practical solution to a problem, rather than as a philosophic truth. One can say that it is a theory suggesting how best to accommodate one's ignorance but not that it is a theory leading to a reduction of that ignorance. 13 Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115. His later article, "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," in Proof , 4 (1974), furthers the discussion by elaborating upon and providing numerous examples to illustrate the distinction between single-authority and multiple-authority situations. There are, of course, many instances of multiple authority in which the earliest surviving texts (earliest in each line) are not equidistant from the lost common ancestor. But Greg's theory operates in such cases, because—in the absence of contrary evidence—one can presume the text nearest the lost ancestor to be the most reliable in accidentals. At times, as in any other copy-text situation, an editor may have reason to believe that some text other than the nearest one is the most reliable, and he would then select it as copy-text; otherwise he would select the nearest one. Unlike a situation of equidistant radiating texts, the editor in these instances has a presumptive authority to fall back on when there is no other means for reaching a decision. In other words, it is the existence of authoritative texts that are equidistant from a lost ancestor, not simply the existence of texts representing independent lines of descent from that ancestor, which poses a problem for the application of Greg's approach. 14 "Multiple Authority," p. 91. 15 MP , 48 (1950-51), 12-20. 16 Bowers calls it "one of Greg's three criteria for determining the authority of variants that when a choice seems indifferent, the odds are in favor of the specific authority of the original reading" (p. 15). Actually Greg does not make this one of the three criteria (as stated on p. 385 of Collected Papers and summarized above, p. 177, in the sentence beginning "That judgment depends partly") but rather a procedure to follow when use of these criteria proves inconclusive (for if they were not inconclusive, the choice would not be indifferent). 17 This streamlining of the apparatus extends also to the simplification of the symbols employed, utilizing considerably fewer than were envisaged by McKerrow in his Prolegomena . 18 Such as that in On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists (1955), pp. 71-83; "Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts," in Studies in Honor of T. W. Baldwin , ed. D. C. Allen (1958), pp. 11-12; and Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), pp. 141-142. 19 Read before the American Literature section of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association on 22 November 1962 and published in SB , 17 (1964), 223-228. 20 The term often used in connection with Renaissance texts is "old-spelling"; but "unmodernized" is probably better, since it more clearly suggests that the modernizing of accidentals in general, not just spelling, is the point at issue. 21 The fact that nineteenth-century accidentals are nearer our own than those of the sixteenth century means that the general reader or the classroom student has less difficulty in using an unmodernized text for this period; but it has nothing to do with the fact that a scholar requires a text representing as accurately as possible the author's own accidentals, regardless of the ease or difficulty with which that text can now be read. There are, in fact, a considerable number of differences between nineteenth- and twentieth-century accidentals, particularly punctuation; but, as Bowers says, "one may flatly assert that any text that is modernized can never pretend to be scholarly, no matter at what audience it is aimed" (p. 223). Obviously, if accidentals form part of an author's expression of meaning, one cannot modernize and still have what the author wrote and meant. One can always argue that the authors themselves would not want their punctuation and spelling to be preserved at the cost of not being read; but such an argument has no bearing on the needs of scholars to have before them, insofar as it is possible, exactly what the author wrote. Modernized editions can then follow, when they seem necessary, though they must inevitably be a compromise. Some of the issues involved in the question of modernizing are discussed in John Russell Brown, "The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions of the Plays of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries," SB , 13 (1960), 49-67; Arthur Brown, "The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions . . . A Rejoinder," SB , 13 (1960), 69-76; and Jürgen Schäfer, "The Orthography of Proper Names in Modern-Spelling Editions of Shakespeare," SB , 23 (1970), 1-19. See also footnotes 93, 98, and 99 below. 22 That is, it must result from editorial decisions and not be simply a reprint of one particular text. It could, of course, in rare instances be such a reprint—but only because the editor judged no emendations to be necessary, not because he was committed to reproducing a single document without alteration. 23 He continued to demonstrate the bibliographical and textual problems raised by nineteenth-century works in "Old Wine in New Bottles: Problems of Machine Printing," in Editing Nineteenth-Century Texts , ed. John M. Robson (1967), pp. 9-36. 24 But one which, it seems reasonable to assume, is basic, since it can provide the details necessary for use in preparing other kinds of editions. 25 The use of the Hinman Collator, developed by Charlton Hinman for the detection of variant formes in the Shakespeare first folio, to make collations of copies of machine-printed books from the same type-setting or plates is another instance of the application to later books of methods conceived in connection with earlier ones. For a list of articles dealing with mechanized collation, see the CEAA Statement (2nd ed., 1972), pp. 19-20. 26 He also emphasizes, like Greg, the practical side of the point: "This distinction," he says, "is not theory, but fact." Obviously the "fact" is not that the editor can always distinguish correctly between the author's and other's changes but that Hawthorne's manuscripts do exhibit many differences from their first printings and that unauthorized changes are likely to enter a text every time it is set in type. 27 Bowers, using the example of Hawthorne, speaks of reporting all the editions during the author's lifetime. But since the reason for choosing that period is to cover any editions which might incorporate authorial changes, one can infer that any pirated edition—which can be established as pirated and thus as having no connection with the author—can be excluded from the listing. A collation of such an edition, however, is naturally still called for, so that the editor can be sure that the variant readings in it do not suggest authorial revision in spite of the external evidence. 28 This point again reflects Greg's rationale in its focus on the accidentals of the copy-text. Once the importance of preserving the accidentals of the copy-text is established, the importance of deciding when to retain, and when to omit, copy-text line-end hyphens becomes evident—as well as the importance of informing the reader in this respect, as in others, of exactly what occurs in the copy-text. 29 The history of the pamphlet is sketched by Thorpe in his introduction. The MLA's Committee on Research Activities had earlier presented a report (edited by Helmut Rehder) entitled "The Aims, Methods, and Materials of Research in the Modern Languages and Literatures," published in PMLA (67, no. 6 [October 1952], 3-37) and as a pamphlet. The section of that report on "Editing and Textual Criticism" (pp. 15-19), written by Lawton P. G. Peckham, does not mention Greg's rationale and sets forth the idea that "the last edition revised by an author, or published in his lifetime with his consent, is most likely to satisfy literary needs" (p. 16). 30 The essay appears on pp. 23-42 of the original edition. In 1970 a revised edition was published; Bowers's essay, on pp. 29-54, was enlarged chiefly by the insertion of illustrations from the writings of Stephen Crane (the longest such insertion occurs on pp. 51-52). 31 In addition to covering, as one would expect, such matters as whether a text is to be critical, whether it is to be modernized, and what role analytical bibliography plays in editing. 32 Under the revised title Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures . The revised discussion of proofreading adds a further requirement, based on the experience of several editions: that a final check be made to determine whether printers' errors have entered after the final proofs, by performing a machine collation of the unbound printed gatherings against the last set of proofs. 33 The seal itself was of course devised as a shorthand way of informing the reader or buyer that certain standards had been met and of promoting a broader general awareness of the need for reliable texts—with the potential result that readers would begin to demand, and publishers to seek, texts which qualified for the seal. 34 Except for one footnote, which suggests that the "graphic peculiarities of particular texts" should probably not be recorded in the "general apparatus" but "may appropriately form the subject of an appendix" (p. 386). Apparently the "general apparatus" Greg has in mind consists of footnotes; and, since he believes that "in this respect the copy-text is only one among others," he is expressing the view that emendations of accidentals in the copy-text should "probably" not be listed at the foot of the page but rather at the end of the volume—the practice which Bowers adopts in the Dekker. As early as 1760 Edward Capell, in his Prolusions , employed a similar system, in which one category of readings is listed at the foot of the page, and at the end come "all the other rejected readings of the editions made use of" (p. iii). Capell saw the value of making a specific text the "ground-work" of his own and of recording all departures from it as well as variant readings from other editions, so that the reader would have "all the materials that can be procur'd for him," in order to re-examine the editor's decisions. 35 The only way in which adherence to Greg's theory affects the content of the usual CEAA apparatus is that the historical record of variants normally lists only substantives, not accidentals. There would obviously be no objection to the inclusion of the accidentals as well, but in most cases the number involved would be so great that the effort and expense of listing them would not seem to be justified, in view of the lack of importance attaching to accidentals in later editions under Greg's theory. If someone disagrees with the editor's choice of copy-text, therefore, and wishes to re-edit the work using a different copy-text, he cannot reconstruct the accidentals of that text from the usual CEAA historical collation. Nevertheless, the editor of a CEAA edition explains his choice of copy-text in his textual essay, citing not only external evidence but illustrative readings from the texts; he generally provides enough evidence so that a reader will have an adequate basis for agreeing or disagreeing with his choice. Naturally a person who decides to re-edit the text employing a different copy-text will have to turn to a copy of the edition containing that copy-text; but he should be able to rethink the question of copy-text in the first place on the basis of what is included within the CEAA volume. 36 Obviously it makes sense to follow established forms whenever there is no particular reason for not following them, so that readers will have fewer adjustments to make as they turn from one edition to another. 37 For an examination of the variations in apparatus among CEAA volumes and of certain considerations to keep in mind in choosing among them, see G. T. Tanselle, "Some Principles for Editorial Apparatus," SB , 25 (1972), 41-88; and "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts," forthcoming in the Library . 38 For some discussion, see William H. Gilman, "How Should Journals Be Edited?", Early American Literature , 6 (1971), 73-83. 39 The CEAA has recently begun to offer a seal for "An Approved Facsimile." The first facsimile to be published under this plan is that of the manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage , edited by Fredson Bowers with extensive introductory material and appendixes and published in two volumes in 1973 by Microcard Editions Books. The next two such facsimiles are to be those of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Ledger and of the manuscript of The Great Gatsby , edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli. 40 The CEAA seal, reading "An Approved Text," is awarded only to editions which contain these two elements. However, when a CEAA text is leased by a reprinting publisher, the "An Approved Text" seal remains on the new volume, so long as the text is faithfully reproduced, even if the apparatus is not also reprinted. Perhaps logically the original CEAA edition should contain a seal for "An Approved Apparatus" as well as for "An Approved Text," since the "Text" seal, when it appears in the originating edition, covers more than the text. Such a seal—reading "An Approved Apparatus"—already exists for a different purpose: it is available to editors who have gone through precisely the same CEAA editorial process but find that publication of the actual text is not feasible (because of copyright restrictions, for example, or lack of interest on the part of a publisher). In these cases the apparatus is keyed by page-line references to the copy-text edition, and a reader, entering the listed emendations on a copy of that edition, can bring its text into conformity with the critical text established (but not published) by the editor. The first apparatus of the CEAA pattern to be published separately from a text was Matthew J. Bruccoli's "Material for a Centenary Edition of Tender is the Night ," SB , 17 (1964), 177-193; the advantages of and appropriate occasions for such an approach are discussed in James B. Meriwether's "A Proposal for a CEAA Edition of William Faulkner," in Editing Twentieth-Century Texts , ed. Francess G. Halpenny (1972), pp. 12-27. Bruccoli has recently prepared the first separate apparatus to receive the CEAA seal and to be issued as an independent publication ( The Great Gatsby , University of South Carolina Press); see his discussion of it and the proposed series of which it is to be a part, in "The SCADE Series: Apparatus for Definitive Editions," PBSA , 67 (1973), 431-435. 41 "Practical Texts and Definitive Editions," delivered on 16 February 1968 and published, along with a paper by Charlton Hinman, in Two Lectures on Editing: Shakespeare and Hawthorne (1969), pp. 21-70. Bowers's essay includes (footnotes 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, on pp. 36-39, 42, 46-48) some comments on Richard H. Fogle's unfavorable review of the Hawthorne edition in American Literary Scholarship: An Annual, 1965 , ed. James Woodress (1967), pp. 21-27; Fogle's comparison of the Ohio State edition of The House of the Seven Gables with a classroom edition (Riverside) prompted Bowers's decision to elaborate on the differences between the two kinds of editions: "without the stimulation of his confusion of the true issues it is unlikely that this paper would ever have been written" (p. 38). Bowers has continued to discuss the differences in later articles, such as "The New Look in Editing," South Atlantic Bulletin , 35 (1970), 3-10 (which also comments on Jesse H. Shera's review of the Hawthorne edition in American Notes &amp; Queries , 1 [1962-63], 159-260); and "The Ecology of American Literary Texts," Scholarly Publishing , 4 (1972-73), 133-140. Joseph Katz discusses the shortcomings of certain practical editions in "Practical Editions: A Bad Resource for American Literary Study," Resources for American Literary Study , 3 (1973), 221-229 (which includes references to the Proof articles surveying the practical editions of individual works). 42 This point has been well put by Leon Howard in his review of the Hawthorne edition in NCF , 22 (1967-68), 191-195, when he remarks that, "even though textual theory might change, the work has been done and the information made available for every serious student of American literature" (p. 193). Of course, new information can turn up later, as Bowers recognizes when he says that "definitive" is "only a comparative term, since we must always believe that from time to time the accumulation of scholarship will enable an editor to improve on the work of his predecessors" ("Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts" [cited in footnote 18 above], p. 13). Similarly, he begins his discussion of "Established Texts and Definitive Editions," PQ , 41 (1962), 1-17, by noting, "Nothing but confusion can result from the popular assumption that only one form of an established text can ever exist, and hence that a definitive edition of a single form of a literary work is invariably possible." 43 Although I shall be commenting here principally on essays which take an adverse view of Greg's theory and the CEAA (since they naturally bring into sharpest focus the issues involved), it is clear that some of the reviewers who have written favorable, but often perfunctory, notices of CEAA volumes have no real conception of the aims of those editions. References to some of the more significant reviews are made in the CEAA Statement (2nd ed., 1972), p. 23; a number of other reviews, principally from 1969, are listed (along with other CEAA publicity) in CEAA Newsletter , No. 3 (June 1970), pp. 36-38. Although a few of these reviews, and some others, are referred to in these pages, I do not take up individual reviews in any detail, since the questions they raise usually involve judgment of particular cases rather than general principles and procedures. 44 In the 26 September installment (pp. 7-10), headed "Their Wedding Journey," he comments not only on this volume of the Indiana Howells edition but also on Typee in the Northwestern-Newberry Melville and The Marble Faun in the Ohio State Hawthorne; on 10 October (pp. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) he limits himself to "Mark Twain," taking up three volumes of the California edition of Mark Twain papers— Satires and Burlesques, Letters to His Publishers , and Which Was the Dream ? 45 The New York Review of Books for 19 December 1968, pp. 36-38, contained letters from William H. Y. Hackett, Jr., and Theodore Besterman, which Wilson prints in his postscript; letters from George B. Alexander, Ronald Gottesman, and Paul Baender, which Wilson refers to; and letters from Frederick Buechner and Frank J. Donner, which Wilson does not mention (but whose correction of "Albert Payson Terhune's" to "Albert Bigelow Paine's" is incorporated in the text at 189.6). 46 As Wilson notes in the 1968 pamphlet, the article had originally appeared "in a slightly different form." For pamphlet publication a number of stylistic revisions were made (e.g., "persistent" for "acute" at 179.21 [all page references are to the 1973 volume, as the most accessible text]), some errors were corrected (e.g., the comments on the Constable Melville and the Russell &amp; Russell reprint at 191.6-9), some additions were incorporated (e.g., the parenthetical sentence at 172.8-11), and five footnotes were added (those on pp. 164, 166, 182, and 186, and one not retained in the 1973 book: attached to the sentence ending at 156.4, it read, "These volumes now range in price here from $10 to $14"). Three of those footnotes cite information supplied by correspondents (those on pp. 164 and 166 based on Gottesman's published letter, and that on p. 186 credited to Alexander's published letter). As Wilson points out in his postscript, other revisions were based on comments in letters, particularly Gottesman's (though in describing one of the corrections—"Reedy" to "Rudy" at 164.5—he reverses the two words); but some corrections available to him in letters were not in fact utilized (see footnote 49 below). The 1973 volume incorporates a few more corrections (e.g., "Newberry" for "Newbury" at 163.22) and omits one footnote (as noted above). 47 Epstein and John Thompson submitted a proposal—for a series of editions of the kind Wilson desired—to various foundations and eventually to the National Endowment; in 1966, at the time of the initial award of $300,000 to the MLA, $50,000 was to be made available for the Wilson plan whenever facilities for administering it were developed (they never were). The New York Review of Books , edited by Epstein's wife, had included, eight months before Wilson's article, another review critical of a CEAA edition—Lewis Mumford's "Emerson Behind Barbed Wire" (18 January 1968, pp. 3-5). Mumford objected to the Harvard edition of The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson because of its inclusion of material discarded by Emerson and its use of editorial symbols within the text to record Emerson's revisions. The Mumford piece provoked considerable correspondence, including a letter from Wilson criticizing the MLA "stupid academic editions" and describing his Pléiade idea. The issue of 14 March 1968 (pp. 35-36) contained letters from (besides Wilson) Lewis Leary, William M. Gibson, and G. S. Rousseau, and a reply from Mumford; another letter, from M. H. Abrams and Morton W. Bloomfield, along with another reply from Mumford, appeared in the issue of 23 May (p. 43). Mumford's review, of course, does not touch on the subject of Greg's rationale, since the choice of copy-text is not an issue in connection with Emerson's manuscript journals. 48 For example, he approves the inclusion in the Pléiade Proust of "an omitted episode" and the restoration in the Soviet editions of Pushkin and Tolstoy of "cut or altered passages," and he looks forward to a complete edition of Mark Twain's Autobiography , since "we have never had the whole of this work"; yet he believes that one of the pieces included in Which Was the Dream ? ("Three Thousand Years among the Microbes") "might well be omitted from the canon" because "it turns out to be disappointing" (p. 178). 49 Gibson's essay, "The Center for Editions of American Authors" (pp. 1-6), was reprinted from Scholarly Books in America , 10 (January 1969), 7-11. Two of the letters (pp. 7-12), by Ronald Gottesman and Paul Baender, had previously been published in the New York Review of Books (19 December 1968); two others (pp. 13, 17-19), by Frederick Anderson and Oscar Cargill, also addressed to the New York Review , had not been published before; and a fifth (pp. 14-16), by John C. Gerber, had been sent directly to Wilson and had not been published. (A footnote to Gerber's letter points out that Wilson did not correct in the pamphlet his misstatements about the Mark Twain Papers and Works noted here.) Fisher's essay, "The MLA Editions of Major American Authors" (pp. 20-26), besides providing a historical account which includes information about Wilson's "Pléiade" plan, makes some response to Wilson's articles. The pamphlet ends with "A Calendar" (pp. 27-28), listing relevant events back to 1947. Bowers's comments on Wilson's articles appear in Two Lectures on Editing , pp. 23-25 (footnote 2) and p. 70 (footnote 30). Benjamin DeMott's "The Battle of the Books," in the New York Times Book Review , 17 October 1971, pp. 70-72, offers a journalistic account of the controversy. 50 It is symptomatic that Wilson, and Mumford before him, both try to divorce these editions from humanistic learning. Mumford says that the culprit behind the Emerson edition is the "Academic Establishment," fostering "the preconceptions and the mock-scientific assumptions governing the pursuit of the humanities today" (p. 4). Wilson makes disparaging remarks about editors who are not interested in literature (p. 170), exaggerates the technical language employed (p. 169), and prints with obvious delight a letter from W. H. Y. Hackett, Jr., ridiculing, among other things, the Hinman Collator (pp. 198-99). Ray's comment, though printed without a citation of source, is taken from his "Foreword" to The American Writer in England: An Exhibition Arranged in Honor of the Sesquicentennial of the University of Virginia (1969), p. viii. 51 SB , 22 (1969), 311-318. 52 The other of his principal illustrations deals with collateral texts, deriving independently from a lost common ancestor; in these situations he believes that it would be "misleading" to denominate one of the collateral texts a "copy-text." An editor's statement, however, ought to make clear the reasons for selecting a particular text as the basic one, so that the reader will not find the label "misleading." If the collateral texts are equidistant in descent from the lost common ancestor, of course, it is true that there may be no basis for selecting one over another, and the editor must then construct a copy-text on the basis of all these texts, as Bowers has explained in his discussion of "radiating texts," referred to above (footnote 13); but from that point on Greg's theory of copy-text applies as usual. And if the collateral texts are not equidistant from the lost common ancestor, the editor is able to follow Greg's rationale directly, by selecting the one nearest the ancestor unless he has strong evidence pointing toward another choice. 53 My views on Baender's argument are set forth in greater detail in "The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note," SB , 23 (1970), 191-196. See also Bowers's comment in "Multiple Authority" (cited in footnote 13 above), p. 82 (footnote 1). 54 "On the Editing of Modern American Texts," BNYPL , 75 (1971), 147-153. 55 Although Pizer continually refers to "the" theory of copy-text, it is obviously Greg's theory which he is discussing. One should understand, however, that an editor necessarily has a "copy-text," whatever he may call it, and that Greg's is only one among many conceivable rationales for selecting a copy-text. 56 That the result might be "complex and bulky" is undeniable; that it is therefore "all but unusable" does not follow. Anyone who wishes to comprehend a complex textual history would presumably not expect to find the evidence as easy to follow as it might be in less complicated situations. 57 Pizer is particularly worried about the future republication of CEAA clear texts without accompanying apparatus: "It is a nice point," he believes, "whether a clear-text critical edition sans apparatus is any different from an unedited text"—because "in either case the reader must go to considerable effort to check the evidence" (p. 152). A critical text exists to present an informed reconstruction of an author's intended text, based on an examination of all known evidence and on critical insight into the author's aims and methods; a text which is "unedited" (presumably edited only by the original publisher's editor or reproduced from a contemporary printing by a later editor) does not purport to serve this purpose. There is nothing similar about the two except that they are texts of the same piece of writing and that they are texts as opposed to apparatuses. If a reader wishes to consult the documentation which an apparatus provides and finds no apparatus accompanying his text, he may be somewhat inconvenienced by having to go to a library to examine a CEAA edition (text plus apparatus), but surely less so than if he had to collect the evidence himself with which to judge an "unedited" text. 58 If Pizer is concerned (as he seems to be in his proposal of "textual organicism," pp. 152-153) to preserve as a respectable possibility the idea of a collected set which includes some "definitive editions" along with some "practical editions" (to use Bowers's terms), all one can say is that there is no theoretical objection to it, so long as each text is clearly labeled for what it is. 59 Pizer, in his footnote 5 (p. 148), gives the impression that he has not fully grasped Greg's central insight: that there is no reason to expect authority in substantives and authority in accidentals to reside in the same text. What Pizer says is that the "suspicion of later texts . . . affects the entire matter of the choice of copy-text while receiving explicit expression primarily in relation to accidentals." That is of course just the point: the potential authority of a later text in respect to substantives is in no way affected by the choice of an early text as the authority in accidentals. 60 Pizer's sixth footnote (p. 148) recognizes this fact and is a more trenchant discussion of the issue than what appears in the body of his article: "I should note my awareness of the great range of variation possible within the publisher-author relationship and of the consequent need for editorial knowledge and discretion in determining the degree of authorial acceptance of a publisher's changes." 61 While it is possible to argue that the change of even a single word in a text produces a new work, critical discrimination has not advanced very far which makes no attempt to locate that point along the spectrum of revision where alterations to improve the expression of one conception give way to alterations that shift the conception itself. 62 Grabo, "Pizer vs Copy-Text," BNYPL , 75 (1971), 171-173; Parker, "In Defense of 'Copy-Text Editing,'" 337-344. Bowers makes a few remarks on Pizer's article in "Multiple Authority" (cited in footnote 13 above), pp. 86-87 (footnote 11). 63 "How Not to Edit American Authors: Some Shortcomings of the CEAA Editions," BNYPL , 75 (1971), 419-423. 64 Because Freehafer cites Hershel Parker's reply to Pizer in connection with this discussion, Parker makes a further brief comment in "Historical Introductions vs Personal Interpretations," BNYPL , 76 (1972), 19. Freehafer's statement that "those who cannot successfully criticize an author ought not to edit him" (p. 420) seems not to recognize editing as a critical activity itself; what constitutes "successful" criticism is of course an open question. 65 As for explanatory notes, the CEAA editions have not by any means uniformly excluded them, and the CEAA Statement encourages them for certain kinds of works. In any case, Freehafer's belief that an editor who does not provide explanatory notes will be less likely to detect, for example, errors in the spelling of proper names is merely questioning editorial competence in general; any responsible editor investigates the spelling of names of persons and places as a routine part of his job, and, if he makes a mistake in a given instance, the fault surely cannot be traced to the fact that he was not obliged to write explanatory notes. 66 The view that the CEAA editions "will probably be looked upon in the future as a monument to a temporary overemphasis on an imperfectly borrowed and excessively bibliographical style of editing" (p. 421) is puzzling. The "bibliographical" emphasis is an emphasis on establishing the history of each text, and the CEAA editors could be charged with "excess" in this regard if they claimed that all future editions of these works should have the same emphasis; but it is odd to regard as "temporary overemphasis" the effort to put on record information which will be useful in the future for producing different kinds of editions with texts based on other principles. 67 " The Marble Faun and the Editing of Nineteenth-Century Texts," Studies in the Novel , 2 (1970), 487-503. This article is a detailed review of the Ohio State edition of The Marble Faun and makes fewer general observations than the title might suggest. It represents the kind of close examination of a CEAA volume which has been all too infrequent, but for the most part it is concerned with the evaluation of particular emendations rather than with questions involving the use of Greg's rationale. One paragraph (pp. 498-499), however, does say that, because Greg's theory seems to work in connection with The Marble Faun manuscript, it does not follow that the theory can be applied "to all fair-copy manuscripts of the nineteenth century," since certain authors (several are cited) are known not to have punctuated their manuscripts for publication and others (Henry James) are known to have carefully revised their punctuation for later editions. It should not be necessary to repeat that Greg's theory does not demand the use of manuscript as copy-text when there is convincing evidence favoring another course. Freehafer makes some of the same criticisms of the Hawthorne edition, especially in regard to emendations resulting from a policy of "normalization," in his reviews of Hawthorne scholarship in Jahrbuch für Amerikastudien , 15 (1970), 293-294, and 16 (1971), 268-269. 68 "'On the Editing of Modern American Texts': A Final Comment," BNYPL , 75 (1971), 504-505. Pizer has published remarks on CEAA editions or on Greg's theory in a number of other places. For example, he has commented unfavorably on the Crane edition in a review in MP , 68 (1970-71), 212-214, and in his survey of Crane scholarship in Fifteen American Authors before 1900 , ed. R. A. Rees and E. N. Harbert (1971), p. 100 (the edition reflects "the present emphasis on critical texts and common sense be damned"). And his Rosenbach lecture, "Dreiser's Novels: The Editorial Problem" (published in Theodore Dreiser Centenary , 1971), asserts that Greg's theory, by causing editors to focus on that prepublication state which is "at once chronologically closest to the printed book and still completely sanctioned by the author" (p. 10), results in neglect of earlier prepublication states. A twentieth-century author, he says, "was more apt than his fellow novelist of a hundred years earlier to find that what appeared in a first edition was indeed what he wanted to appear in that edition" (p. 11); as a result, the real editorial problem becomes—for Dreiser, at any rate—"not to determine his final intention but to use the material at hand to demonstrate how he reached that intention" (p. 12). Most editors, however, unless they have decided to edit a particular early version of a work, are inevitably concerned with "final intentions"; but that concern does not mean that their editions cannot include data relevant to a genetic study of the prepublication stages of the work, and indeed the CEAA Statement urges editors to include a record of at least the substantive pre-copy-text variants. (The principal difference between the two approaches is that Pizer prefers printing selected passages from earlier states as footnotes to the main text, whereas the CEAA Statement recommends a discussion, illustrated by quotations, of the nature of the various stages of prepublication revision.) 69 Proof , 1 (1971), 122-155. Peckham's ideas had earlier appeared, in compressed form, in the discussion of "General Textual Principles" in the first and second volumes of the Ohio University edition of Robert Browning (1969, 1970), pp. vii-ix; beginning with the third volume (1971) this section is somewhat expanded (pp. vii-xiii) and contains a reference to this Proof essay. 70 I have discussed this part of his essay in "Bibliography and Science," SB , 27 (1974), 55-89. 71 It is not clear, however, why "sparse and inconsistent" punctuation in itself justifies the separate treatment of substantives and accidentals. Similarly, Peckham states in the next paragraph, "Greg's distinction rests upon the fact . . . that nobody but Ben Jonson [among Renaissance dramatists] took writing for the public theater seriously" (p. 125). Does this imply that later writers of "serious" literature normally managed to exert careful control over the printed forms of their work? And does it imply that for works of later periods editing usually involves only the correction of obvious errors in a text which otherwise embodies the author's final wishes in every respect? 72 When Peckham says that "what to do about punctuation is an empirical matter, not a theoretical matter, not a matter of editorial principles or rules" (p. 126), he is actually agreeing with Greg's position that each situation must be examined on its own terms; Greg was providing a "rule" only for those situations in which empirical evidence does not convincingly settle the question. 73 Of course, errors are made in the transmission of substantives as well as accidentals. David J. Nordloh, in "Substantives and Accidentals vs. New Evidence: Another Strike in the Game of Distinctions," CEAA Newsletter , No. 3 (June 1970), pp. 12-13, cites an instance in which a substantive variant between a manuscript and a magazine text can be shown to have resulted from a typist's error in the intervening typescript. It may be that without the typescript an editor would have taken the magazine reading as the one intended by the author; but the existence of such instances does not affect the general proposition that substantives as a class have normally received more careful treatment in transmission than accidentals. 74 Peckham's recollection of having heard, as a boy, stories about the serious consequences of incorrect punctuation in government documents (p. 125) does not really illustrate any common awareness "that punctuation cannot be separated from words," for the point of telling such stories is that the situations involved are exceptional and contradict everyday experience. Similarly, the "shift from rhetorical to syntactical punctuation in the first half of the nineteenth century" is not convincing evidence of such an awareness; both approaches support Peckham's view that punctuation consists of written signs for juncture, pitch, and stress and thus is part of the meaning, but he does not make clear why the shift from one to the other reflects a general awareness of this point. 75 One further observation of Peckham's on accidentals deserves notice. A logical consequence of his view that accidentals and substantives are inseparable is to deplore the absence of accidentals variants in the historical collations in CEAA volumes. The CEAA Statement naturally does not prohibit their inclusion; but it is undeniable that their absence springs not merely from the great expense that would be incurred in most cases by listing them but also from the emphasis of Greg's theory itself on the lack of significance of post-copy-text accidentals. As Peckham points out, a record of variants in accidentals would be important for the historical study of punctuation, and in addition, of course, it would give the reader a still fuller picture of the evidence which the editor had at his disposal. My own view is that variants in accidentals ought to be included whenever feasible (and particularly when the copy-text is a manuscript); but the time and money involved may in many—perhaps most—instances seem out of proportion to the amount of use that would be made of such information. See also footnote 35 above. 76 Peckham uses the word "change" as more neutral than "revise," for he is under the impression that "'revise' now generally means to change for the better" (pp. 138-139). 77 As I called it in "Textual Study and Literary Judgment," PBSA , 65 (1971), esp. 113-114. I do not mean that "scholarly" editing is not also creative in a general sense but am using "creative editing" as a shorthand way of referring to editing which has a different aim from that of historical reconstruction. Lewis Leary, who uses the term in "Troubles with Mark Twain," Studies in American Fiction , 2 (1974), does not, in my view, sufficiently distinguish between the editor who adopts a reading which seems "best" to him and the editor who selects what he thinks would have been regarded as "best" by the author. 78 In the section of his essay on analytical bibliography and science (pp. 129-136), Peckham recognizes that the analytical bibliographer is a historian; see Tanselle, "Bibliography and Science" (cited in footnote 70 above), pp. 83-87. 79 Whether one is attempting to reconstruct his first, or last, or some other, intention is an important matter but is beside the point until one grants the goal of reconstructing authorial intention of some sort. The question of "original" versus "final" intentions is helpfully illustrated by examples from Melville in Hershel Parker's "Melville and the Concept of 'Author's Final Intentions,'" Proof , 1 (1971), 156-168. 80 When Peckham says that "textual editing" is "logically independent of problems of aesthetics" (p. 136), he means that the artistic status of a work (whether or not it is generally considered to be an effective work of art) has nothing to do with the process of editing the work. But that does not mean that critical or aesthetic judgment is not involved in the editor's assessment of the evidence. At another point (p. 151) Peckham states, "The notions of text and author have been responsible for the fact that a discipline which came into existence as a reaction against textual eclecticism has returned to textual eclecticism"; but the more likely explanation would seem to be simply the growing recognition that it is foolish to attempt to eliminate critical judgment from historical research. 81 Let me repeat: I recognize that Peckham is asserting the essential identity of all "editorial" actions and that the scholarly editor I am speaking of cannot avoid, in Peckham's terms, producing his own version of a work. I am not disagreeing with Peckham on this point but am trying to show that there are valid discriminations to be made nevertheless among the versions produced and that it is not meaningless to regard some as approaching more closely than others to an "authorial" version, even if what is "authorial" must be to some extent a subjective judgment. (A "critical" edition, of course, by definition involves an editor's inferences about authorial intention, as Bowers makes clear by using the word "inferential" in his description of an editor's aim as "an attempt to approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy"—in "Textual Criticism" [cited in footnote 30 above], p. 33.) 82 Their whole approach shows their recognition of the impossibility of a definitive text , even though they, too, sometimes contribute to the confusion by an imprecise use of the words "text" and "edition." 83 I have commented in somewhat more detail on these parts of Thorpe's argument in "Bibliography and Science" (cited in footnote 70 above), pp. 78-80. Thorpe devotes an entire chapter, "The Province of Textual Criticism" (pp. 80-104), to setting forth the view that the "bibliographical orientation" of textual criticism is excessive; and his discussion of textual criticism as a "science" occupies the second section (pp. 57-68) of his chapter on "The Ideal of Textual Criticism" (this chapter was originally read on 8 February 1969 at a Clark Library Seminar and published that same year, along with a paper by Claude M. Simpson, Jr., in a pamphlet entitled The Task of the Editor , pp. 1-32). 84 Thorpe believes that the title Statement of Editorial Principles should be "Statement of Editorial Methodology" (p. 73), and he takes the title to be indicative of a confusion between aims and techniques. Actually the CEAA pamphlet deals with both, as the title of the 1972 revised edition ( Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures ) attempts to indicate. 85 Thorpe is correct in saying that "actual collations never provide more than some facts on which the trained intelligence can work" (p. 73); but the point he misses in the Statement's remark that relevance is decided by collation is simply the fact that external evidence (e.g., an author's statement that a particular edition is a piracy) must be tested by what appears in the text itself (e.g., the presence or absence of differences that could reasonably be regarded as authorial revisions). See footnote 27 above. 86 If Peckham needs evidence that people still do react differently to accidentals than to substantives, Thorpe's statement here (and elsewhere, as on p. 74) provides a good illustration. Philip Young, like Thorpe, seems to judge the worth of editorial labor by how dramatically the text is altered, when he remarks that he "cannot find a single really significant difference between the new text [Ohio State Scarlet Letter ] and that of the Riverside Edition (1883), regularly referred to in the bibliographies as Standard" ("Hawthorne and 100 Years: A Report from the Academy," Kenyon Review , 27 [1965], 215-232; reprinted as "Centennial, or the Hawthorne Caper," in Three Bags Full [1972], pp. 79-98). Young's discussion fails to recognize that what he regards as insignificant may appear significant to another critic and that the evidence, whatever it is, should be available in print for all to consult. 87 This statement occurs in a paragraph which was not present in the 1969 published version of this chapter. 88 The CEAA Statement does not take a great deal of space to make this point, nor does Thorpe, who says, "The sources of such information are so various that it is hardly worth mentioning any, except as examples" (p. 181). 89 This chapter is an expanded version of a paper read at the University of Kansas on 30 April 1971 and published later that year as a pamphlet entitled Watching the Ps &amp; Qs: Editorial Treatment of Accidentals . 90 Additional evidence of the freedom with which nineteenth-century compositors altered accidentals is offered in two of James B. Meriwether's contributions to the CEAA Newsletter : "House-Styling, Vintage 1856," No. 3 (June 1970), pp. 11-12; "'On Careless Punctuation,'" No. 5 (December 1972), p. 3. 91 Originally published in PMLA , 80 (1965), 465-482. 92 Thorpe's position on this question is criticized by Peckham, who points out (p. 152) that "intention" about past events must inevitably be a reconstruction, for which an author's statement is only one piece of evidence. In an essay called "The Intentional? Fallacy?", included in The Triumph of Romanticism (1970), Peckham states the point more fully: "Briefly, an inference of intention is a way of accounting for or explaining the generation of an utterance; it can never be a report. The speaker of an utterance has greater authority than anybody else in his so-called intentional inference only because he is likely to have more information for framing his historical construct, not because he generated the utterance" (p. 441). See also footnote 81 above. 93 Although Thorpe says, "The basic principle is that the author's intentions with respect to accidentals should be carried out" (p. 198), he also asserts, at the end of the same paragraph, "Whether the text should be presented in old-spelling or in modernized accidentals is mainly a matter of convenience for the intended audience"—as if there is no contradiction involved. He surveys the arguments for and against modernizing accidentals on pp. 134-140 and pp. 169-170 and concludes, "I can say that the losses from modernization seem to me less than most textual scholars assume" (p. 170). Nevertheless, despite his reluctance to distinguish clearly the purposes and implications of the two kinds of texts, the primary focus is on the author's own wishes: "Our task is, I believe, to fulfill the intentions of the writer in these small details [accidentals] as well as in greater matters" (p. 165). 94 For Bowers's criticism of Thorpe's position, see footnote 6 in "The New Look in Editing," South Atlantic Bulletin , 35 (1970), 8; for Peckham's, see Proof , 1 (1971), 122, 135-138, 152. See also the reviews by John Feather, in MLR , 68 (1973), 381-382, David J. Nordloh, in Resources for American Literary Study , 3 (1973), 254-257, and G. R. Proudfoot, in Library , 5th ser., 28 (1973), 77-78. 95 Bowers, in his review of Gaskell, "McKerrow Revisited," PBSA , 67 (1973), 109-124, speaks of Gaskell's "rejection of Greg's classic theory of copy-text" (p. 122). But Gaskell does not reject it totally: his explanation of the difference between substantives and accidentals and of the reason for choosing an early text as authority for accidentals is obviously derived from Greg. What Gaskell rejects is the logical extension back to the manuscript of the steps that led to the choice of the first edition over a later edition as copy-text. Cf. my review in Costerus , n.s. 1 (1974). 96 The separate question of whether different versions of a work exist, each deserving to be edited separately from different copy-texts, is touched on by Gaskell in a somewhat confusing way. Near the beginning of the chapter he calls it "an anomaly of bibliographical scholarship today" that "much effort is expended" on editing works "of which the early texts differ from each other only in minor and frequently trivial ways," while "books of which we have texts in several widely different forms are either avoided by editors or edited in a single version" (p. 337). If "single version" means one of the author's versions, the process would seem to be what the situation probably calls for; if it means (as the context suggests) an eclectic or "critical" text, one would have to say that such a text might be, but would not necessarily be, inappropriate—depending on the way in which the forms of the work are "widely different," whether as a result of a large number of changes or as a result of the nature of what changes there are. That Gaskell is thinking primarily in quantitative terms is shown later in the chapter. In discussing authorial revision of printed texts (p. 341), he states that the first edition remains the copy-text, provided that the author did not revise the punctuation and provided that "the revision [of substantives] is not extensive (say no more than a word or two in each paragraph)." Similarly, after describing the extensive revisions of Pamela (citing 8400 changes in the first two volumes of the last version), he asserts, "Here it would obviously be impossible for an editor to incorporate the first, the intermediate, and the final versions of the novel in a single critical text" (p. 342). Maybe so, but the reason is not the sheer number of changes; for only the nature of the differences, and not merely their quantity, can justify regarding two versions of a work as, in effect, separate works. I discuss this point further in my forthcoming article on "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention." 97 Of course, "rigidly" prejudices the case, since an editor who "rigidly" followed the manuscript, or any other text, without regard for the specific evidence involved would plainly be in the wrong. 98 That regularizing or normalizing amounts to modernizing has been made clear by Hershel Parker in "Regularizing Accidentals: The Latest Form of Infidelity," Proof , 3 (1973), 1-20. Furthermore, as he says in his cogent concluding section on the dangers of modernizing, "Normalizing to satisfy an editor's instinct for tidiness or to make smooth the way of a reader is ultimately demeaning for the editor and insulting to the reader." I have made some further comments on regularizing in "Bibliographical Problems in Melville," Studies in American Fiction , 2 (1974), 57-74, and in "The New Editions of Hawthorne and Crane," Book Collector , 23 (1974), 214-229. 99 A third book of a general and introductory nature which appeared in 1972 is F. W. Bateson's The Scholar-Critic: An Introduction to Literary Research . Although not limited to bibliographical and textual matters, as Thorpe and Gaskell are, it contains a chapter on "Textual Criticism" (pp. 126-146) which belittles the "'biblio-textual' school" of Greg and his followers (for supposedly attempting to eliminate literary judgment from editing) and endorses modernized texts. His argument for modernization seems strangely inconsistent with his own general position. He begins by labeling as a fallacy the view that "the ability to compose great literature necessarily carries with it the ability to spell and punctuate it correctly" (p. 139). But he later makes the sensible distinction between "good English" and "correct English," and it would seem that the attempt to enforce "correct" punctuation (by whatever standard) on an author's work would reveal as petty an attitude as to wish that he had been more "correct," and perhaps less effective, in his wording. And if printed literature is to be considered a recorded form of oral language—as Bateson describes it in "Modern Bibliography and the Literary Artifact," in English Studies Today , 2nd ser. (1961), pp. 67-77, from which part of this chapter is drawn—it would seem that punctuation would have to be regarded as an inextricable part of the effort to convey nuances of meaning in print. When he recommends that accidentals "should always be modernized" except when "such a process affects the meaning" (p. 142), it does not seem unreasonable to conclude that his statement amounts to saying that accidentals should never be modernized. That we can understand Shakespeare without reading him in his own pronunciation—a point cited by Bateson in support of his position—is irrelevant; for, while the pronunciation of words does not, within limits, seriously affect their meaning, the way in which we are directed to speak them by the punctuation does frequently affect it. (Bateson has also expressed his view of modernizing in a letter to the TLS , 1 January 1971, pp. 14-15.) 100 While the present paper was in proof, another essay critical of Greg's theory appeared. Vinton A. Dearing, in "Concepts of Copy-Text Old and New," Library , 5th ser., 28 (1973), 281-293, argues that Greg's procedure, by emphasizing an early text rather than a later one, "implies that a scribe or compositor regularly puts more errors into a text than the author takes out of his copy" (p. 293). Actually, of course, it implies no more than that errors do creep into a text as it is transmitted; each variant must still be given careful individual attention. Dearing's proposed solution raises many more questions than it answers: "Count the changes certainly made by the author and those certainly made by the scribe or compositor, and assign the rest to the cause with the greater total." I trust that it is unnecessary to enumerate the difficulties which such a statement involves. Still another relevant essay which appeared too late to be cited above is "The CEAA: An Interim Assessment," by Hershel Parker with Bruce Bebb, PBSA , 68 (1974), 129-148, which offers succinct evaluations of the CEAA editions in respect to design, arrangement of material, textual policies, and the provision of historical essays.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts by Hans Zeller *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Independently of one another, in mutual ignorance of the endeavours of the neighbouring discipline, English and German studies have until recently followed quite similar paths regard-the critical constitution of literary texts, though German editors have generally been working without the solid equipment of analytical bibliography. But for about the last ten years a new theory of the establishing of texts has begun to take effect in German editions, and seems to be gaining more and more ground with editors. Seen from the viewpoint of English studies, this new theory might look like a regression from the position held by Greg to the McKerrow phase of editing. Yet the motives behind the emergence and elaboration of the new Germanist theory are not the same as those implicit in such objections as have been raised against the application of the Greg-Bowers principles to the editions of modern American authors. Therefore the recent efforts of Germanists may be of interest to editors of English and American literature, just as the Germanist concept must rely on the application of bibliographical criteria for further expansion and development. It has not by any means attained the level of the applied Greg-Bowers principles, which display a greater refinement and more solid foundations than any other editing procedure known to me. It goes without saying that the common purpose of both is to elicit, through the distortions of transmission, what the author wrote, and what corresponded to his intention; and there is a common endeavour to proceed according to formulated rules. What distinguishes more recent German editions both from most earlier editions and from recent English ones is fundamentally a different understanding of the notions of version ("Fassung") and of authorial intention and authority ("Autorisation"), and ultimately a different theory of the literary work and its mutations. This new understanding resulted from a crisis which occurred when the edition of Goethe's works, planned by the Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin since 1949, was in preparation. The Academy edition was to have replaced the so-called Weimar or Sophia edition, a historical-critical edition of Goethe's works conceived in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Just as the decisive phases in the development of English editing have been determined largely by Shakespeare scholarship, so also German editing, with its conceptions and its mistakes, has been shaped by Goethe studies. When Greg's fundamental essay appeared in 1950, Ernst Grumach, who was at the time in charge of the Academy edition, urged the necessity for a new edition of Goethe with a critically established text. 1 His plea was based above all on criticism of the Weimar edition and its canonisation of one particular authority, in this case the final revised edition ("Ausgabe letzter Hand") supervised by Goethe. Over a period of years (1825-1830), and with Goethe's approval and guidance, his philological assistants, above all Göttling, brought uniformity to the linguistic form (for instance, inflexion) and to the orthography of his works, and revised the punctuation; Goethe himself only occasionally intervened and worked with them himself, thus conferring upon the shape of the work what has been termed merely "passive authorisation", as opposed to the "active authorisation" which alone can be binding for the editor. To the strong unauthoritative textual overlay caused by this process and approved by Goethe, were added those corruptions which the texts trailed with them. These were augmented in the customary manner from edition to edition, often for decades: distortions which could usually have been discovered only by comparison with early editions or manuscripts, a practice of which Goethe expressed disapproval. Grumach's criticism was that what had not been undertaken at the time, namely a real recension of the text, had not been undertaken by the Weimar edition either (1887-1919), in that the edition simply followed the principles valid for the "final revised edition", and departed from the text only in the case of obvious corruptions, declaring "o n e edition sacrosanct and regarding all other witnesses . . . as contributory only". "The task of the critical editor", according to Grumach's 1950 phrasing, "can only be to produce the best text", that is to say, "to examine the text conscientiously and to the best of one's ability, taking into account all available textual evidence and all factors affecting transmission and development of the text, in order to produce the version of the text which gives adequate expression to the intention of the author." 2 The realisation of Grumach's concept can be examined in the two volumes which appeared under his supervision, containing text and apparatus of Goethe's epic poems. 3 The transmission and establishment of the text of two poems is presented here in abridged form, as an example of a German edition approaching Greg's concept. The most important authoritative documents for Goethe's epic Reineke Fuchs (4312 hexameters in 12 cantos) are: E First edition in Goethe's Neue Schriften , vol. 2, 1794. Printer's copy not extant. Goethe did not read proof. At least 57 misprints (in Grumach's estimation), some of which are corrected in a printed errata list probably made at Goethe's request. A Works, vol. 10, 1808. The printer's copy was a revised exemplar of E, probably with considerable alterations in punctuation and reshaping of a number of lines by Goethe. There is no evidence that Goethe read proof. In Grumach's estimation, 54 misprints in the text. B Works, vol. 11, 1817. The printer's copy was a revised exemplar of A; Goethe had altered wording and punctuation in the first four and in the last (12th) canto. Goethe is not known to have read proof. 25 new misprints in the text. C Works, final revised edition, vol. 40, 1830. Set from an exemplar of B, corrected by Göttling according to Goethe's directives. No alterations in the text demonstrably attributable to Goethe. Goethe did not read proof. The text of the Academy edition (designated hereafter as the edited text) was in this case not based on the first printing in E, but, following Grumach's general concept, on the text as printed in A, being Goethe's last complete revision of the work (B having been revised by Goethe only in five out of twelve cantos). Departures from the base text A occurred (1) in order to adopt such variants in wording and punctuation from B as Grumach attributed to the author, that is to say, in order to adopt the last certain authorial alterations; (2) in order to correct the 54 misprints in A, for which purpose the reading of the first edition E was introduced, or, if E was also corrupt, the reading of the nearest witness in chronological sequence, B or C; (3) in order to standardise the spacing. Goethe's epic Hermann und Dorothea , with approximately 2000 lines, displays a rather more complicated textual history: H 3 Scribal copy, written 1796/97, with several layers of corrections by Goethe. H 4 Lost printer's copy of E, probably a fair copy of H 3 . H 5 Subsequent list of corrections to H 4 , disregarded by E in three places. E First edition, separate publication, 1797. Set from H 4 H 5 and from a further lost list of corrections to H 4 . E is a correct text without misprints! N Pirate reprint of a reprint of E, with 241 corruptions of the text. A Works, vol. 10, 1808. Set from a copy of N as worked over by Goethe. 141 misprints were reproduced; in two places the corrupt wording was varied; in two places the corrupt punctuation was altered; in the remaining cases the original reading was restored; 13 additional new misprints. No evidence that Goethe read proof. B Works, vol. 11, 1817. Set from A. Some new misprints; variants in orthography and punctuation, indicating a general scanning of the text but not thorough corrections by Goethe. No evidence that Goethe read proof. C Works, final revised edition, vol. 40, 1830. Set from an exemplar of B, corrected by Göttling according to Goethe's directives. 5 new misprints. Goethe did not read proof. In the establishment of the text, the first edition was regarded as superseded by the revised version A. The last complete revision had to serve as base for the edited text, that is to say, A. Since the 141 corruptions which had penetrated from the pirate edition could not be regarded as intended by Goethe, but only passively authorised, the edited text reverted in these instances to the correct text of E; the two places where the corrupt punctuation had led to an alteration (probably by the compositor), and the 13 places newly corrupted in A were handled similarly. In the two places, however, where the corruption of N had led the author to make a correction, this correction was left in the text as representing the final intention of the author. Moreover, those three variants were adopted from H 5 which had not passed over into E. Thus no variants were adopted from the versions subsequent to A, because none of these exhibited individual alterations which could be proved to go back to the author. The extent to which this editorial procedure coincides with the principles of Sir Walter Greg is evident: each individual variant is investigated to see whether it originates from the author. If this cannot be made to seem probable, the variant is not adopted in the text. In this way the edited text appears as an eclectic (contaminated) text. The fact that the text is not edited on the basis of the witness containing it in its earliest published form (in analogy to the concept of "copy-text editing") but instead on that of the last version fully revised by the author has to do with the fact that German editorial procedure does not distinguish in so marked a way between accidentals and substantives as does Anglo-American practice. 4 This establishment of text as carried out by Grumach can be taken as typical of German editing in the 1950's. But for reasons which in this case are not known to me, internal difficulties arose. The guidelines which Grumach had followed were replaced by new "basic principles". 5 These formed the core of a new concept which has by no means gone unchallenged, but which has been winning more and more support from editors, it seems to me, since it gradually became known. Implicitly, the stipulations include among other things some indirect criticism of the methods of establishing text which had previously been customary, in particular of Grumach's procedure. Inasmuch as Greg's concept and that of Grumach coincide, there is also implicit criticism of the former, when applied to conditions of transmission such as those typically obtaining for writers of German literature since the 18th century. I shall take up those points which are essential in the present context and attempt to develop the concept somewhat further. Matters of principle are raised above all by the following questions: (1) Is contamination admissible, that is to say, may the editor transfer variants from one authorised version to another, as happened in the Academy edition and as the Greg-Bowers principles require? (2) What is meant by the (final or non-final) intention of the author, and how may it be determined? (3) What should be regarded as textual error?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Concept of Version ("Fassung") "Eclectic editing", the establishing of a text from more than one authoritative document, comprises two types of multiple authority which are essentially different from one another, although they may occur in combination. In the first type, the missing original is represented by several radiating texts, from which their common original is to be reconstructed through the adapted application of the stemma rules of classical editing. 6 I too approve this procedure. What is under dispute here is the second type of multiple authority: only in this case do I speak of contamination. Here one eclectic text is produced from authoritative documents which differ from one another in essence through the intervention of the author. This eclectic text is supposed, among other things, to realise the final intention of the author, as far as this is possible on the basis of extant documents. In the first type of multiple authority the textual differences are exclusively errors caused by the process of transmission; in the second, there is an added difference between versions which is intended by the author. Texts with authorial variation I designate as different versions ("Fassungen"). In the most extreme case a version is constituted by a single variant. A holograph with one alteration which does not simply correct an error thus represents two versions of the text. Though it is unusual to express oneself in this way, it is not possible to give a useful definition of the concept in any other terms. The significance of the definition will become apparent immediately. The main difficulty in realising Greg and Grumach's undertaking, namely in establishing a text representing as reliably as possible the demonstrably final wish of the author, lies in separating from one another transmissional and authorial variants. In order to achieve this, Greg set up the well-known rules: "An editor should in every case of variation ask himself (1) whether the original reading is one that can reasonably be attributed to the author, and (2) whether the later reading is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former. If the answer to the first question is negative, then the later reading should be accepted as at least possibly an authoritative correction. . . . If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to (2) is negative, the original reading should be retained. If the answers to both questions are affirmative, then the later reading should be presumed to be due to revision and admitted into the text. . . . It will be observed that one implication of this procedure is that a later variant that is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the text." 7 Characteristic of this procedure is that the same set of questions is applied to each individual reading, and it is left to the discerning judgement of the editor to classify it. There can be no doubt but that what results is assured of the maximum authority with regard to the sum of all its elements. 8 The question is, however, whether the sum of authoritative readings yields an authoritative text. Should not the authority of a text be considered to extend equally to the texture of the text, to the relationship of its elements to one another and to the whole, and therefore to what constitutes a text as a text, to what makes it into a particular version? As far as I know, the methods of textual constitution under discussion take this basic aspect of the version into consideration only in special cases: "In some literary works it is generally recognized that a revision may be so thoroughgoing — so motivated throughout by the author's altered political, social, or artistic concepts" 9 — that the variants cannot be transferred and the editing of more than one version in parallel texts or in separate editions is required, because the later version represents an entirely new creative act, and demanded in a sense a new manuscript. As examples the different versions of Wordsworth's Prelude are cited, or Henry James's revision of his early works Roderick Hudson and The Portrait of a Lady . "There are two 'final' versions." "Each of these texts deserves to stand in its own right as a separate text." 10 I assume that the differentiation is made not merely for the sake of avoiding an overflow of variants in the textual apparatus, that is to say, for practical reasons, but as a response, in these cases, to an altered authorial conception of the work, and thus for reasons of theory and principle. The question then arises as to whether it is in fact possible to mark a borderline between the two differently treated cases, whether it is practicable to make the distinction in every instance. One could not, for instance, decisively distinguish two versions by quantitative criteria, which might demand that the variants should exceed a certain number, or that a certain time must have elapsed before the revision. In the line "Dass endlich zerbräche das kühle Haupt", in the last version of Trakl's poem Passion ( Agony ), the manuscript has the adjective "kühle" (cool) for deleted "glühende" (glowing), but one cannot maintain that this alteration is more far-reaching than when in the same manuscript the "Purpurne Wolke" (purple cloud) is replaced by "Goldene Wolke" (golden cloud). 11 The first stanza of Hölderlin's Feiertag hymn describes parabolically the condition after a storm. In the prose draft of the poem we read "vom erquikenden Reegen des Himmels"; in the metrical version "von des Himmels erfreuendem Reegen". At first sight one might not raise objections if an editor or commentator considered the two readings ("erquikenden / erfreuendem Reegen") simply in terms of stylistic improvement as the replacement of a commonplace expression by a clearly metaphorical adjective. Yet related within the text the matter looks different: 1 Wie wenn am Feiertage, das Feld zu sehn 2 Ein Landmann geht, des a) Abends, b) Morgens, wenn 3 Aus heisser a) Luft b) Nacht die kühlenden Blize fielen 4 a) Den ganzen Tag b) Die ganze Zeit und fern noch a) hallet b) tönet der Donner, 7 Und von des Himmels a) erquikendem b) erfreuendem Reegen 8 Der Weinstock trauft One might still regard the variants in l. 4 "hallet / tönet" in this manner, namely as synonyms, and similarly, without regard to the context, "Den ganzen Tag / Die ganze Zeit" in l. 4. But related within the text it becomes apparent that this is just as impossible as with l. 3 "Luft / Nacht", and that the same difference exists as between the variants in l. 2 "des Abends / des Morgens". Here it is impossible to regard the variants as synonymously varying expressions. The variation emerges as a contrast in meaning, and therefore in intention, and thus it is determined that in l. 4 "Tag / Zeit" are not synonymous; rather, "Tag" 4a contrasts with "Nacht" 3b. These variants do not only occur between the prose draft and the metrical version, but also internally in the latter. 12 The draft and the metrical version are directly consecutive in the manuscript, and were presumably written down in direct chronological sequence. The variation attests a differing concept of time within the one manuscript. Therefore, contamination between the variants of the two versions is out of the question, Instead of saying merely that the variants correspond to a new concept, however, I can also say that there is a certain relatedness between them, that they result from a relatedness, the relatedness of a version. In one quite specific case contamination in establishing a text is probably the only correct procedure. This is when it can be proved that the author did not make alterations which bore a relationship to one another and to the whole, but simply altered things here and there in isolation. But can that be proved? In adopting the procedure of contamination the editor starts in general from the premise that the intention of the author and the concept of the work remain the same even when a revision is made, unless this assumption can be disproved by such obvious contradictions as that "Abends" and "Morgens", "Tag" and "Nacht" be synonymous. Such cases are regarded as special cases. But in the remaining cases the editor is to my mind doing in principle just what he would be doing if he were to adopt the procedure of contamination with Hölderlin, only it is less obvious. Fredson Bowers once said of a distinction of this sort, an editor who strains at a gnat may swallow camels too. What is disturbing to me in this construction of categories is that it is not founded on any explicit theory, that it tends rather to mark as special cases those intractable instances which would in fact refute the implicit hypothesis. The hypothesis consists in the tacit assumption that the alterations of the author do not in general result from relatedness, 13 and the assumption in turn is based on the usual absence of striking evidence to the contrary. The very opposite answers to my own general view of the essence of a literary work, but this again can be proved only in special cases, for instance when there are close syntactic links between the newly introduced textual elements, or links in rhyme or metre, or—as in the instance cited (Hölderlin)—clear semantic relationships. But what becomes obvious only in such instances is to my mind almost always the case. My conception rests on the linguistic idea of the text as a complex of elements which form a system of signs, both denoting ( signifiant ) and denoted ( signifié ). 14 That it is a system means that the work consists not of its elements but of the relationships between them. However, the clear relationships between the elements form only a part of the relevant relationships. Relationships exist likewise on the phonological level of the text, on the lexical level, etc. Seen in this way, a version is a specific system of linguistic sings, functioning within and without, and authorial revisions transform it into another system. As I said, in principle a new version comes into existence through a single variant. Since a text, as text, does not in fact consist of elements but of the relationships between them, variation at one point has an effect on invariant sections of the text. In considering different versions one must therefore not confine one's attention to the variants. This is most clearly exemplified when the title of a work is altered. Fundamentally, therefore, whether the variants are numerous and of far-reaching effect is not a necessary condition for the constitution of a version. 15 A new version implies a new intention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Problem of Authorial Intention The application of the Greg-Bowers copy-text theory requires the interchangeability of variants from different versions. This requirement, as far as I can see, rests on the assumption that the alterations made by the author are isolated improvements within a concept which remains constant, unless the opposite can be proved, which it rarely can. This assumption in turn is usually accompanied by a particular notion of the mutations of a literary work; in German studies this notion is rooted in Goethe's understanding of himself as man and poet. As was described in the introductory section, in establishing Goethe's texts from the final revised edition, Grumach had in each instance adopted only substantive alterations attributable directly to Goethe, not, however, the alterations undertaken by Goethe's assistants under his surveillance—not far-reaching standardisation of punctuation, orthography and word forms. He regarded these as alien to Goethe's text, often detrimental to Goethe's real intentions; that they were retained in the Weimar edition (1887 ff.) is said to have been the result of "false piety". At this point, criticism of Grumach's edition set in. Friedrich Beissner founded his objections on "the right of the author to his own work", and declared that for a complete edition the principle of the Weimar edition had been unquestionably right in giving favourable consideration to the final revised edition including the standardisation, because Goethe wanted it, and sanctioned the procedure of his assistants, and the result. An editor, however, would be obliged to carry out Goethe's final intentions better than his assistants did at that time; he would have to standardise according to more refined methods and at the same time "preserve what was distinctively Goethe's". He would only be entitled to reverse alterations which "could be proved to be in opposition to Goethe's real intentions and which had been overlooked by him." 16 The establishment of a text which appeals ultimately to the intention of the author may easily give rise to controversy. To the process of standardisation mentioned, which reflected in the main the scribal habits of the 1820's, Goethe also subjected works which had come into existence 50 years earlier with quite different graphical characteristics, works which had been the foundation of his literary fame. Thus according to his final intention Goethe wished to appear before his readers not out-moded and old-fashioned, but in modern, contemporary orthography. Would it not be right for an editor citing the intention of the author in support of his edition, believing himself obliged to carry out what the author himself no longer carried out, to derive from this even the obligation to transpose Goethe's works into modern spelling, "while with utmost sensitivity respecting and preserving what is distinctively Goethe's"? Were this to happen, a basic principle of the historical-critical edition would be injured by the principle of the final intention. The axiomatic preference for the final intention of the author as against his earlier intentions can be seen in two ways. Either it is based on the teleological notion that the work itself has a goal, or that the author envisages one, and that in the course of time he brings his work nearer and nearer to it; correlated with the work is a concept which the writer's "improvements" can realise with increasing refinement and precision. (Therefore it is emphasised that only a change in concept hinders the application of the copy-text theory.) Or it is based on the related morphological notion that the work is an organism, that its mutations are a "development", an "organic growth", a continual process of ripening, from the seed perhaps even to perfect maturity. This was how Goethe saw his life's work. And this was how the editors of the Weimar edition saw Goethe's final revised edition: "By nature [!] the last edition represents the summit, the conclusion." 17 Moreover another concept is adduced, which in my opinion signifies an old confusion of the textual and the legal spheres, namely when that same edition is described as "Goethe's testamentary disposition", as "his bequest", and when the editors feel themselves to be his literary executors, and believe that they are commissioned by him to carry out what he wished to undertake but did not himself complete. If one wanted to pursue this editorial principle of final authorial intention to its logical conclusion, it would lead in some cases to the annihilation of the object of the edition through the edition: even today one would have to destroy The Aeneid . For Virgil demanded of his friends Marius and Tucca that they should burn the work which at his death was extrinsically complete, intrinsically unfinished; it was to be destroyed for purely artistic reasons, because it did not fulfill his standards. Augustus ordered them to publish the poem. 18 Franz Kafka demanded of his executor Max Brod that he should burn his unprinted writings unread. 19 Instead he published them. This time there was no emperor. But only the executor, not the editor, can be set at odds by such an expression of the author's wishes; the editor's philological task, here as elsewhere, can only be to interpret extant documents and accompanying circumstances as historic facts. In my opinion he has to deal with the intentions of the author not as an executor, but only as a historian, and he should regard them not as binding directives for editorial decisions, but as historical phenomena. And I believe that this is the way in which texts should be regarded altogether, in their relationships to one another, to their originators, and to the conditions of their genesis and influence. I see the following parts, or rather aspects, of the history of a work: (1) the history of the text, that is to say, the history of its emergence and the alterations made to it by the author; (2) the history of its influence and reception, which begins as soon as the work, or parts of it, become known to other people; (3) the history of transmission, that is to say, the process following on from the textual history, where, even under the eyes of the author, the work begins to be affected by those intentional and unintentional textual alterations which accompany its dispersion. The aspects overlap at times; unauthorised "facsimile" reprints ("Doppeldrucke") and pirate editions with their distortions may provide the basic copy for an authorised revision of the text. Of importance for our discussion is above all the interdependence of factors of textual history and of influence and reception. Apart from rare exceptions, it is safe to assume that authors want to be read, and that in writing they think of a public. For this reason an author not only has an effect on his readers, he is in turn affected by their reaction. It is not possible (or only rarely, in exceptional cases), when a work is revised, to give a detailed account of the extent to which the reception of the first version, a change in society, a change in the author himself and in his relationship to his environment, a different incentive or purpose in publication, may be involved in the revision, and this holds all the more true since right from the beginning, before he even thought of writing, the author was exposed to this play of forces from all sides. What is termed the intention of the author is an undetachable part of these forces, and therefore seems equally ill-suited as a criterion for editorial decisions or as a criterion for the evaluation of literary works. Only the textual history is within the editor's reach: notes, extracts, drafts, when they have survived, and then the versions in chronological sequence, a diachronic succession of discrete semiotic systems. The totality of the versions yields the diachronic pattern of the work. Each individual version yields a synchronic linguistic pattern. If one imagines the textual history in the shape of a 3-dimensional cylinder standing upright, then the different versions are horizontal planes perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. The purpose of the historical-critical edition (apart from the necessary correction of mutilated text) is to create an appropriate reproduction of this cylinder, that is to say, of the complete textual history; while the purpose of a critical edition is to reproduce a particular plane, that is to say, an individual version. Contamination would mean the projection of one plane onto another. In the historical-critical edition the editor selects one version (or, when there are substantial differences between the versions, more than one) for reproductions as the text in his edition, and he presents the remaining textual history (or possibly all of it) in the apparatus. 20 From a historical point of view the different versions are in theory of equal value. Each represents a semiotic system which was valid at a specific time, which the author later rejected, because he for some reason no longer found it adequate, in favour of another version which matched his new intention. To explain the alterations by saying that one assumes the author's intentions are still the same but that he was not previously able to realise them so well, is to declare him a bungler. Whether the author regards the alterations as an improvement of his work, or as an enhancement of its literary qualities, whether or not he declares the earlier version invalidated, or condemns it—for the historian, for the editor, the alterations mean an adaptation of the work to suit the altered circumstances, ideas and purposes of the author. For the editor there is no "best version". In selecting the text to be edited he is not bound by the final intention of the author. He may, for instance, defend the young Goethe's works against the revision of the 75-year-old, of whom it can be proved that he in part no longer understood, or no longer wanted to understand, the creations of his youth. The editor of Ernst Jünger's works will probably reject the alterations which the author made to his earlier works after the collapse of the Third Reich, and edit the original versions. In specific cases the choice of version for the edited text may depend on very different factors; the history of influence and reception may be decisive, or again the degree of corruption or purity of a particular version. As long as the editor sees his function as that of a historian, he has a wide range of freedom in the selection of the version for the edited text, but this version he must reproduce without contamination. The establishment of a text oriented to the intentions of the author is confronted with considerable difficulties when it becomes apparent from the variants that the magnetic needle of the author's wishes is quivering in the field of non-aesthetic forces. This leads to characteristic problems. The printer's copies for the first edition of some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novels have survived, fair copy autographs. The manuscripts of The Blithedale Romance (1852) and The Marble Faun (1860) display traces of the influence of Hawthorne's wife Sophia. Crosses in the manuscript of The Marble Faun , as the editor tells us, mark places which Sophia noted in order to suggest to her husband an alteration (in style or content). Usually the author complied, as the corrections show. In three marked places, however, he resisted. One of these places, with the phrase "vinous enjoyment", is characteristic of Sophia's temperance convictions. 21 In the manuscript of The Blithedale Romance Hawthorne made excisions only in three places; two are concerned with liquor and one with sexuality. It is not possible to ascertain, says the editor, to whose initiative the deletions are to be traced, but it seems very probable that they "were made in deference to the sensibilities of Hawthorne's wife. . . . Although the deletions undoubtedly represent his final intentions, the causes behind these intentions are suspect." "The reasons could not have been literary." 22 Therefore the deleted passages have been re-adopted in the critical text. It seems to me that in the editor's decisions the difference which obtains in the case of The Marble Faun , where Hawthorne resisted the influence of his wife, does not find adequate expression, and for methodological reasons I find the idea perplexing, that the editor should feel obliged not only to make inferences about the final intentions of an author, but also about the causes behind these intentions. I cannot regard the psyche of the author and its analysis as a substantial foundation for editing. All cases of actual and suspected self-imposed censorship give rise to this kind of analysis. Fredson Bowers, as editor of Stephen Crane's Maggie (1893), did not by any means put a veil over the difficulties involved in such distinctions; he placed them clearly in the foreground on several occasions. 23 The first version of the novel could only be printed privately under a pseudonym. When Crane found a publisher for it three years later, the publisher demanded an attenuation of the drastic language, that is to say, expurgation "to remove most of the profanity and perhaps some of the sordid detail characteristic of the original version" 24 (in Crane's own phrase, "words which hurt"). Problems arise, because it is clear that Crane voluntarily undertook further corrections and in some instances it is not clear to which category the alterations belong. This is the case with three deletions in chapter 17 and with some modifications, which were carried out either "under the impression that they would be required by the general agreement . . . about the nature of the revisions", 25 or for purely artistic reasons, for the "softening of satire or of shocking detail". 26 The editor feels obliged to come to a decision on this score in each case, and to include in the edited text only those departures from the first version which match "the author's final and uninfluenced artistic intentions". 27 The investigation of the nature of the deletions in the 17th chapter constitutes a highly impressive interpretation of the two versions of this chapter ("Textual Introduction," pp. lxxviixci), and leads to the conclusion that there are no grounds for assuming anything other than a deletion made by Crane deliberately for literary reasons, in order to resolve an ambiguity. One might of course ask whether an investigation of this sort should be the concern of an editor or of the textual critic, or rather of the literary critic. 28 Greg's principles, in particular the aim of clarifying "whether the later reading is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former," 29 and most particularly this "reasonably", require the editor to undertake ad hoc investigations of this nature whenever an alteration is suspect. However, would it not ultimately put him under the obligation not only of examining the variants, say, stylistically, but also of interpreting, with regard to the alterations, the original and the revised version of the text, taking into consideration all its relevant dimensions, and would this kind of interpretation not lead directly into the hermeneutic circle, inasmuch as the revised version represents both the basis and the goal of the investigation? It is indeed notable that scattered through the comments of the editor on the motives behind certain of Crane's softenings are phrases such as "could be", "it is not certain", "it is possible", "probably". 30 The reason for this does not by any means lie in a deficiency in the editor's powers of analysis, but in the thing itself: if one has to reckon with purely literary and purely censorial motives for alteration, one must also reckon with a combination of the two. Firstly, in anticipation of the character of the expected censorship, Crane could be led to undertake alterations which also had literary value in the context of the new version. Secondly, because of the systematic character of the work, purely censorial alterations sparked off further alterations, determined at this stage by literary considerations. Again in consequence of the systemic character of the work, the contamination of the two historical versions in the edited text gives rise to a third version. Though the editor may indeed give a rational account of his decision at each point on the basis of the documents, nevertheless to aim to produce the ideal text which Crane would have produced in 1896 if the publisher had left him complete freedom 31 is to my mind just as unhistorical as the question of how the first World War or the history of the United States would have developed if Germany had not caused the USA to enter the war in 1917 by unlimited submarine combat. The nonspecific form of censorship described above is one of the historical conditions under which Crane wrote the second version of Maggie and made it function. From the text which arose in this way it is not possible to subtract these forces and influences, in order to obtain a text of the author's own. Indeed I regard the "uninfluenced artistic intentions" of the author as something which exists only in terms of aesthetic abstraction. Between influences on the author and influences on the text are all manner of transitions. It is in the nature of certain areas of literature that, apart from aesthetic purposes, obligations exist towards practical purposes and diverse forms of non-literary ideology; this is the case with the so-called utilitarian forms such as the essay, the pamphlet, memoirs, originally with all rhetorical forms and with André Jolles' "Einfache Formen", fable, didactic poem and satire, the mediaeval mystery play and legend, Jesuit drama and Brecht's plays of instruction. Klopstock still does not recognise any autonomous poetry of quality. His poetic message is bound up with his religious convictions and obligations. The highest form of poetry, the Christian epic, and religious poetry altogether, is proclamation of faith. "The plan of the revelation is its prime rule", he says of the "sacred poem". Nevertheless, in his major work, Der Messias , he undertakes alterations and deletions for other reasons too, for instance in order to prevent the work from becoming the object of theological disputes detrimental to it. 32 For me it is inconceivable that editors should be allowed to reverse such alterations on the grounds that they were made for reasons neither religious nor poetic. In German literature it was only during Klopstock's lifetime and later that poetry laid claim to an autonomous area of its own, and even then it naturally retained links with the rest of reality. The editor oriented to the artistic intentions of the author is confronted also with those puzzling situations which James Thorpe treats in the second part of his essay, "The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism", 33 asking "what constitutes the integrity of the work of art?" Often the editors of magazines intervene not only in the accidentals of contributions. But even authors who have protested against such changes often adopt them when they publish their periodical contributions in book form, and seem to give them some kind of authority. How is the editor to interpret this behaviour on the part of the author? "Often we cannot be sure whether he makes suggested changes because of a compliant disposition, whether he allows editorial alterations to stand in later editions out of laziness, whether he reverts to earlier readings out of pertinacity, or whether there is reasoned conviction in support of his action". 34 Thorpe comes to the conclusion that the intentions which amount to "the integrity of the work of art" include "those intentions which are the author's, together with those others of which he approves or in which he acquiesces". 35 I think that it is the difficulty, indeed the impossibility, of obtaining a text attributable exclusively to the author, when conditions are really complicated, which led Thorpe towards the recognition of an aggregate of alien influences. In this he adopts a position very close to that of current German studies being described here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Textual Error and Textual Fault ("Textfehler") Our great sensitivity to contamination will be countered from the viewpoint of the Greg principles in the following way:—in transposing the last reliably authoritative substantive variations into the copy-text, which is binding only for the accidentals, one is basically not mixing different versions, but simply cleansing the last version of non-authorial intervention. I am prepared to agree that under quite specific circumstances this is indeed the best way to produce the correct authorial text; namely, if one has as copy-text an autograph printer's copy, if the author can be shown to have read the proofs only cursorily, and directly after the production of the copy, and finally if he can be shown to have exerted no influence on subsequent editions. These conditions are fulfilled, for instance, in the case of some of the novels of Nathaniel Hawthorne (such as The Blithedale Romance ). In a case like this it is my opinion too that one produces the text closest to the author by examining the authority of every single deviation of the printed text from the printer's copy (with the reservations mentioned above regarding the excisions). Only when these conditions are fulfilled does the procedure not conflict with my concept of the versions of a literary work: in such a case one can indeed take it as likely that the author made his corrections and revisions to the proofs on the basis of the idea of the text which was still fresh in his mind from the manuscript, and not on the basis of the text set and altered by the compositor. Where these conditions are not fulfilled, the Greg establishment of text runs in danger of contamination. What I mean can best be demonstrated by an example. Because it is a matter of relationships within a work, it is necessary to present the relevant passages within the context of the work. For this demonstration a ballad by C. F. Meyer is particularly suitable, for which ten textual witnesses have survived from the years 1871-1892. I discount the earliest manuscript because the second document (designated here as H 1 ) has been revised to such an extent that it and the subsequent versions cannot easily be related to the first. The nine documents H 1 -D 9 , on the other hand, can be registered in synoptic sequence in such a way that the alterations of each as against the preceding one can be read off; only text which varies from that of the directly preceding version is registered in each case. Text deleted in the manuscripts is in [square brackets]. Certain variants in punctuation are given in the margin; orthographic variants are listed at the end, so as not to encumber the presentation with them. The nine authoritative documents are as follows: H 1 Manuscript written by C. F. Meyer's sister, dated "January 1873". H 2 Manuscript written by Meyer's sister. Revision of H 1 . Printer's copy for D 3 . D 3 First printing in an almanac, 1873. Deviations from H 2 only in punctuation (subtitle and l. 19) and orthography. No misprints. D 4 Authorised reprint in an anthology, 1876. Deviations from D 3 in wording (subtitle and l. 33), and in punctuation, and graphical changes. Meyer to the editors: "I wish to read proof myself". 8 probable misprints. D 5 -D 9 C. F. Meyer, Gedichte , 1st-5th editions, 1882-1892. D 5 is a revision of D 4. D 6 -D 9 alter only punctuation (D 8 l. 20; D 9 l. 13) and orthograph. In each case Meyer worked over the five editions of the collection thoroughly, and read the proofs, particularly of the first three, carefully. D 5 -D 9 have no stanza division. At line 11, H 1 displays alternate readings ("Alternativ-Varianten"), neither of which is deleted; both therefore have the potential for subsequent adoption. In punctuation and orthography, the synoptical presentation follows the first printing D 3 . Orthographic variants not registered in the synopsis are: title, 22, 33 Komturs, Komturei D 9 6 Küssnach D 7 -D 9 6 dreissig D 4 D 5 D 8 D 9 31 rot D 5 -D 9 35 Heimschritt D 7 -D 9 The ballad is based on a saga from the Swiss Wars of the Reformation. From Küsnacht, a village on the Lake of Zurich, the Grand Commander Schmid, a Knight of the Order of St. John, rode out with other men from Küsnacht to help his friend, the Zurich reformer Zwingli, in battle. At this point the ballad begins. It describes the anxious waiting of those who remained behind, and the return alone of the fallen Commander's charger. The charger is said to have swum across the lake by night and to have entered the stables among the buildings on the Order's estate. At this point (l.33) the text of the first three witnesses has: Die Comturei mit Thurm und Chor Ragt' bleich im Mondenglanz empor. In Meyer's collected poems on the other hand all editions have: Die Comturei mit Thurm und Thor Ragt weiss im Mondenglanz empor. For someone who knows the scene of the ballad as the poet did (Meyer lived for several years in Küsnacht), the original version has particular significance; a late Gothic choir of unusual height still rises high above the nave of the church, as it did in the Grand Commander's time. To leave no doubt about this detail, Meyer emphasised the C of "Chor" by underlining it in the printer's copy H 2 , leaving no room for doubt in the mind of the compositor. But later the mistake seems to have been made nevertheless, when the compositor of the anthology D 4 set the text (presumably from D 3 ). This compositor is probably to be blamed for seven further misprints in the ballad, and also for errors in the 14 other poems and in the prose of C. F. Meyer printed in this anthology, some of them serious distortions of the text. Meyer's wish to read proof himself was probably not fulfilled. The phrase "Thurm und Thor" (l. 33) lacks vision, but it can easily be explained as the result of confusion of the letters C and T by the compositor, as the substitution of the smooth but trivial expression "Thurm und Thor" for the compelling phrase "Thurm und Chor". I am convinced that we have to do with a compositor's error in D 4 at this point and in the loss of the apostrophe indicating the preterite in ll. 1, 25, 32, 34. When Meyer revised the ballad six years later for his collected poems (D 5 ), he clearly used the version D 4 and let the phrase "Thurm und Thor" stand; similarly in all following editions. When I was editing the text of the collected poems twelve years ago, I adopted the view that this could only be a matter of a misprint taken over from D 4 , which as an alliterative formula benumbed the thinking and the perspicuity of the author and his helpers, and was thus able to elude the very thorough corrections of the first three issues of the collection (D 5 -D 7 ). I therefore put the original phrase "Thurm und Chor" from H 1 H 2 D 3 into the edited text. I still consider "Thor" in D 4 to be a misprint, but in spite of this I consider my emendation to D 5 -D 9 to have been wrong. I now believe that "Thor" corresponded to Meyer's intentions when he produced the version D 5 from D 4 , and I believe that in contrast to the versions H 1 H 2 D 3 his intention shifted from the optical, say, to the acoustic, from the image "Thurm und Chor" to the alliteration "Thurm und Thor." This alliteration is very well-suited to the popular tone and archaic language (l.27) of a ballad treating of legendary material. Because of the somewhat singular architectonic conditions, the optical image is an artistic touch which can scarcely be appreciated. There is no indication that Meyer rejected the variant "Thor". But one cannot say whether he recognised the misprint as such and consciously adopted the variant in the text of D 5 . Be that as it may, I believe that D 4 's misprint influenced the alteration of intention observable throughout D 5 , and that it is given authority by this new intention; thus in D 5 -D 9 it can no longer be regarded as a textual error (as it was in D 4 ). The credibility of this assumption is strengthened by a comparison with the other instances of damage to the text in D 4 , to which the author responded by adopting some in D 5 and by varying others. In ll.14a, 14b the postpositional subject has been mistakenly severed by a full stop in D 4 . D 5 does not alter the faulty punctuation, 36 but instead the context; presumably the concluding stop in l. 14 drew Meyer's attention to the expendability of ll. 14a, 14b. We do not have to assume that the misprint in D 4 caused an oversight in D 5 (the omission of two lines), but that Meyer's reaction to the disfigurement in D 4 was to retain what had originated as a misprint while altering the context in D 5 —parallel to l. 33 "Thurm und Thor". In ll. 32-34 we find further misprints in D 4 , whereby the verb forms "Verkündet'" and "Ragt'" lose the apostrophe, the only preterital sign. Whereas in l. 1 "legt'" and l. 25 "starrt'" Meyer reversed the same error, in ll. 32 and 34 he lets the present forms stand, so that presumably the misprint again causes a change in the system, this time in the temporal structure of the poem. In H 2 D 3 the whole poem is in the preterite, with the exception of the direct speech. D 4 certainly has four erroneous forms of the present. D 5 on the other hand has preterite everywhere except in ll. 30-34, and this is deliberate as the change of tense in l. 30 "überquillt" D 5 for "überquoll" D 4 shows; after the speech of the boy in l. 28 the narrative present is introduced. Thus it is apparent that in producing the version D 5 from the text of D 4 , Meyer reversed only two (ll. 1, 25) of the eight disfigurements in D 4 . In the remaining six cases he either adopted the erroneous reading unaltered (l.33), or he changed it again (ll. 20, 21), or he adopted the erroneous reading and altered the context (ll. 14, 32, 34). If I simplify the textual conditions in Meyer's ballad to schematic form, I can say that the relationship between the almanac printing D 3 and the anthology copy D 4 is analogous to that between an autograph manuscript and a faulty printing set from it, of which the author either did not read the proofs at all or only in a very cursory manner. 37 Such special conditions obtain to a considerable degree for Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance , as was mentioned above. Following the Anglo-American usage, I can designate D 3 D 4 as one version, and can call this the first version, since I discount H 1 2 . In this way D 3 could be said to consist of the relationships between the elements A-H. In D 4 the misprints F' G' H' replace F G H. If the editor wants to adopt this first version (D 3 D 4 ) in the edited text, he will be well-advised to reverse D 4 's misprints F' G' H' in order to restore the potential of the relationships between the elements E-F, F-G, etc., established by the author. 1st version {D 3 A — . . . — E — F — G — H {D 4 A — . . . — E — F' — G' — H' 2nd version D 5 A — . . . — e — F' — G — h Contamination D 3 /D 5 A — . . . — e — F — G — h But for the production of the second version (D 5 ) the special conditions (of The Blithedale Romance ) no longer obtain; it is a revision on the basis of the faulty text found in D 4 . As we said, the author produced D 5 partly by using original elements from D 3 which are also in D 4 (A . . . D), partly by altering the original text (e), partly by adopting damaged text (F'), partly by reversing mistakes (G), partly by altering such readings (h). Instead of the relationships of the first version which were intended in D 3 and disturbed in D 4 , we have other relationships. 38 If the editor wishes to adopt the second version (D 5 ) in the edited text, he must give the text of D 5 which the author produced (possibly with emendation of such new misprints as may demonstrably be attributed to D 5 —of which more will be said shortly). On no account may he reverse in D 5 the misprints observed in D 4 , as the Greg-Bowers principles demand; if he did this he would make an arbitrary sychronisation of non-synchronic elements; he would produce from D 3 and D 5 a contaminated version unknown to the author (the bottom line in the scheme), a version which would not have the potential of the relationships as established by the author in D 5 , but some other instead. The reconstruction would be in danger of becoming a construction alien to the author. The example of Meyer's ballad, and also the example from Klopstock's epic quoted in footnote 15, and considerations of a general nature, lead us to the paramount understanding that for the production of a new version the source of the elements which the author uses in the text is immaterial; it does not matter whether the variants are original or extraneous, misprints (as we shall see, there are misprints and misprints) or variants introduced by a publisher's editor. In other words, for the elements of a text to be authoritative, and thus for the text itself to be authorised, it is not necessary to assume that the author recognised extraneous elements included in the text (compositor's errors and editorial intervention) as such; he may have regarded them as original text. The necessary condition for our establishment of text is only that he should have registered the readings in question. That this is the case is sometimes obvious (for syntactic-semantic reasons, etc.), and sometimes it can be demonstrated by interpretation (as in some cases in Meyer's ballad); for the remainder (for instance with other texts by the same author and by other authors), it is an assumption which represents a generalisation made on the basis of the demonstrable cases. This is the root of the matter—here we have the cause of the difference between the establishment of text based on versions on the one hand, and on contamination on the other. Both work from a certain assumption in the undemonstrable cases: corresponding to our uniform view of literary works as semiotic systems we assume that the demonstrable and the undemonstrable cases are fundamentally the same; that is to say, we assume that the author took note of individual readings in the text which formed the basis of the revision (unless there are indications of special conditions as with Hawthorne's Blithedale Romance ). The contaminating edition, however, if I have understood it rightly, assumes rather that the author not only ignored the misprint as such, but also the whole of the passage in question including wording, etc., unless the opposite can be proved; thus it is assumed that the two cases belong to two fundamentally different categories, but that the demarcation line between them coincides with the borderline between the demonstrable and the undemonstrable. I cannot imagine how one could account for this agreeable coincidence. From the methodological point of view, the circumstances are just like those prevailing in the demonstrability of discrete versions as described at the end of section I. Since it is evident that misprints, transmissional errors, or even conscious non-authorial changes need not necessarily remain unauthorised from the "second generation" on, and do not by their original nature alone entitle the editor to emend the text, 39 it is necessary to find a specific term in order to designate those places where the editor does have the obligation to intervene in the text as transmitted. I term them textual faults ("Textfehler"). The question arises, under what circumstances is one to assume not only damage to the text, but also textual fault; what conditions must be fulfilled? In the matter of textual fault, as with contamination (the very risk of which we want to avoid), our considerable caution is not imposed on us by diffuse timidity, or by apprehensiveness about the vindication of editorial decisions, but by specific notions of the most simple literary actualities, and by our experience in editing. First, the theory. By now it has been made clear why authorisation in our sense is not to be related to individual variants, but to versions. Greg's criteria for establishing authority, cited in section I, assure the text only of the authority of individual elements, not of the version or work. If a variant is not to be rejected in favour of the original reading, Greg demands that it should have originated with more than 50% probability from the author. Even if the substance of the version did not prohibit this procedure, there would be other hindering factors, and it is these which make the question of textual fault so problematical. They all follow from simple insights into the modes of existence of literary art to which the theories of the Prague structuralists and their successors have called attention. Fundamentally, there are two attitudes towards the text: the attitude of the reader, the exegete or the editor, and the attitude of the author. (There can of course be permutations.) The former is typically the attitude one adopts towards the transmitted text, probably corrupt at times, which is to be edited and interpreted. The exegete presumes that the author's text arose not by chance but of necessity, that it is unique, unrepeatable, artistically complete, a text of maximum significance. Similarly the editor searches in the transmitted text for the one authentic text, in comparison with which all else will be textual corruption. His attitude can only be that of the most faithful scholarly accuracy. For the author on the other hand a text is something to be created by selection from the semantic inventory of the language, from the quantum of synonyms. That synonyms exist for him, synonyms in the broadest sense of the word, is shown by draft manuscripts with their substitutions which often form whole skeins of variants. In the end the author has made a decision one way or the other, but he could have decided differently. For him creative writing does not mean necessity, but the possibility of variation. Valéry remarked of the creative process: "There is no sense in consummating the word". 40 "In general I cannot take up anything I have written without thinking that I would have made something quite different out of it, had not an interference from outside" interrupted the creative process. Valéry saw no reason why he should be censured "because I presented to the public several, and sometimes even contradictory, texts of one and the same poem." On the contrary he felt tempted "to challenge poets to produce a multiplicity of variants or possible treatments for a single theme." 41 Such a situation naturally renders absurd the scholarly endeavours to find the one authentic text by considerations of probability. The claim to follow the intention of the author in so doing means that the attitude of the author is reduced to that of the reader. To edit the text according to the intention of the author, when the singularities of his intention are known to us only through this text, can be achieved only if the text is in a certain sense redundant, that is to say, predictable. But this condition is fulfilled, as experiments have shown, only in the case of utilitarian texts (e.g., newspaper articles), and not in the case of poetic texts, which are distinguished from other texts perhaps only by their non-redundancy. Errors can as a rule be recognised as violations of a principle. But it is an idiosyncrasy of artistic structures that they themselves transgress the rules or codes which they have set up in the text, in favour of new codes ( internal disautomatisation ). Our personal experiences in editing confirm what this theory would lead us to expect. In the introductory section I described the two-fold establishment of text in Goethe's epic poems, first according to Grumach's guidelines, then according to the stricter "basic principles" of his successors (see footnote 5). The statements about the number of misprints in the 1808 edition of the Works (A) diverge quite considerably: in Grumach's view there are 19 misprints in Achilleis and 54 in Reineke Fuchs , but according to the "basic principles" there are 6 and 8 respectively; in Hermann und Dorothea A has 13 misprints according to the one, 5 according to the other. When, as an editor, one has the opportunity of pondering over a text for a decade or two, one becomes increasingly sceptical of one's own judgement of textual fault, because in the course of time one observes a tendency to acknowledge what had previously been regarded as mistakes as being within the author's range of linguistic possibilities. Therefore, on the basis of theoretical considerations and of editorial experience, we have reached a point of view concerning textual fault and authorisation which is to a certain extent in opposition to the Greg-Bowers principles. 42 Perhaps I may be allowed to take up a comparison which Fredson Bowers once made in a discussion of editorial principles before Greg. He compares his own procedure to the criminal procedure of certain Continental codes, according to which the accused is required to demonstrate his own innocence. Our procedure is more like Anglo-American jurisdiction, with its initial presumption of innocence and the onus of proving guilt. In conclusion I describe in outline our method of procedure, as far as it can be formulated in general terms at the present time. To begin with it is clear that in reckoning with the structure of specific versions we shall not start from the individual reading in order to define authorisation ("Autorisation"), but from the version. When certain conditions are fulfilled we attribute authorisation to a version as such, and treat individual passages as textual faults when there is sufficient evidence. Thus we mean by authorisation a provisional general quality, which may be intermittently suspended. It is assumed valid until the contrary is proved and is not conferred with the finality of the predication of authority according to Greg-Bowers. We regard as authorised those manuscripts which the author worked on himself, or which were demonstrably commissioned by him. Published texts are considered to be authorised if the author desired or approved their production, and if he influenced the text by supplying the printer's copy or by personal revision, or by revision undertaken at his request during the printing process. 43 (Where there is no authorised document, the text is established on the basis of that unauthorised document which is nearest to the lost authority.) Textual fault ("Textfehler"), that is to say, an intermittent suspension of authorisation (in the case of unauthorised documents, an intermittent breakdown in transmission), occurs when two conditions are fulfilled: (1) when the reading in question admits of no sense in the wider contextual setting, or (particularly with modern literature) when it contradicts the logic specific to the text, the internal text structure; (2) when the results of analytical bibliography (in the broad sense of the term) confirm the suspension of authorisation. The bibliographical demonstration requires a detailed investigation of the circumstances of authorisation, such as is usual in Anglo-American studies. In the simpler cases the demonstration can be verified by lists of misprints, correction sheets, or by correspondence concerning individual passages, showing for instance that the author delegated the proof-reading of a particular sheet. There may be a whole cluster of arguments to be cited, whereby it is their convergence which is decisive. The substantiation of the two criteria would require a more detailed discussion than is possible here. 44 It is necessary that the criterion of text-specific logic should be supplemented by the bibliographical criterion, and vice versa. If one wanted to confine one's attention to the bibliographical criterion, the variant reading discussed above, "Thurm und Thor" in Meyer's ballad, would not only be a misprint but also a textual fault: it derives from the printed copy D 4 , is shown by comparison with the printer's copy D 3 to be a misprint, and stands in surroundings which exhibit numerous other misprints. To the surroundings in a broader sense belong other poems by Meyer in the same anthology, which also exhibit misprints, and it must be assumed that the author could not read proof as he desired. A passage from one of the other poems provides an example of the fulfillment of both criteria. The poem entitled "Das Glöcklein" describes a dying woman's dream of death. She listens as the flocks return home in the evening from the alp, everything becomes quiet, and at the end the sound of one bell left behind rings out: "Ein Glöcklein, horch! klingt fern es auch der Schlucht? Irrt es verspätet noch am Felsenhang? Ein armes Glöcklein, das die Erde sucht—" The text of the first line is meaningless in the immediate context (as it happens, other documents show that "auch" is a misprint for "aus"). The text of the third line is meaningless in the broader context of the whole poem, because the homecoming is not to the "Erde", but to the eternal home, to which the "Herde" (the word occurs twice) is returning in this poem. Thus here both the bibliographical criterion and the criterion of text-specific logic are fulfilled. The assessment of what is possible in the language of a text is subject to considerable uncertainty for the reasons of theory discussed above if for no other: the non-redundance of the work of art and its tendency to violate on certain levels the principles which it has itself established—causes which one may recognise in Goethe's observation to Eckermann, that a good poem must as a whole be rational, but in detail somewhat irrational. Therefore the logical criterion alone is inadequate, as the following example is intended to show. In the edition of Dichtungen which Georg Heym's friends produced with a certain nonchalance in 1922 from his literary remains, a stanza of the poem "An das Meer" begins with the lines: "Und etwas tauchen aus der Flut, der matten, / Gesichter, wesenlos vom Totenreich." When Carl Seelig produced the first complete edition of Heym's poems in 1947 he thought that the first line simply did not make sense, tried to reconstruct the graphical image and ended with the following conjecture: "Und Ätnas tauchen aus der Flut, der matten, / Gesichter, wesenlos vom Totenreich." Thus he had wrongly interpreted "etwas" as subject instead of adverbial; in this case the printed copy of 1922 is correct. 45 If an editor assesses a passage only according to the criterion of sense, that is to say, only in terms of what he thinks possible for the author or for the text in question, there is always a danger that something unique, a neologism or an anomaly, may be removed from the text in favour of something more normal. A strange example occurs in the manuscripts of C. F. Meyer. The author had written: "Wie von grausem Bann befreit"; his sister made an alteration, presumably writing from dictation, and replaced the first two words by "Von dem", so that the passage now ran: "Von dem grause m Bann befreit". In print, it was rendered grammatically correct as: "Von dem grause n Bann befreit" (Poem no. 177 D 5 , l. 137). In the handbooks of historical German syntax and in the specialist literature on this subject there is no example from the nineteenth century of the strong form of the adjective after a definite article, as produced by Meyer's sister, so that it is easy to assume that the sister did not carry out the alteration to the end. But this anomaly occurs occasionally in Meyer's own uncorrected and unquestionably legible poetic manuscripts, for instance "Mit dem erschöpfte m Pferd" (Poem no. 170 M 6 , l. 38); and again the reverse case which is perhaps even more noteworthy: "Mit beredte n Mund" (Poem No. 158 M 3 , l. 44); again, in all the versions of the story "Angela Borgia" which appeared during Meyer's life-time: "Mit grausame n Genusse". It is significant that the manuscripts and the printed copy in the periodical still exhibit the strong form which one would expect at this point ("grausame m "), so that the supposedly faulty form does not derive from Meyer but from the compositor, that is to say, from another nineteenth-century user of the language, and Meyer did not alter it, but the editor of the prose in the historical-critical edition considered it to be a misprint and reversed it. C. F. Meyer was no linguistic innovator, and it is inconceivable to me that he should have been alone in the nineteenth century in using inflexional forms in this way. If the forms are not recorded in the reference works and in other linguistic literature, this, and probably many similar instances, is caused by a vicious circle: the editors eliminate rare forms from the language of the edited text in the critical editions, because on the basis of their knowledge of the language, their ideas of the author, their reference books and the descriptions of historical grammar, metrics, etc., they consider them faulty. But these works of reference and their predecessors are based on just such editions purged by the editors. In order to prevent this from happening, it is necessary to supplement the criterion of text-specific logic with the bibliographical criterion. This supplementation is necessary also because of the idiosyncrasy of the work of art referred to above, that it may violate the code which it has itself created. In the area of greatest authority, the autograph manuscript which is not simply a copy, one will be well-advised to admit no textual faults at all. The so-called slips of the pen, and such other disturbances of the writing process as may affect the author's projection of his work, occur, like all other deficiencies, against a specific meaningful background. A separation into deficiencies to be emended would only go to show that the editor's perspicuity is limited. One can of course object to the logical criterion by saying that the most insidious misprints are characterized as such, and remain undetected, because they do not generate a nonsensical text, but an impoverished, more trivial text, mutilated nevertheless. This is the case with the alteration of "Thurm und Chor" to "Thurm und Thor". Under quite specific circumstances, which have been described (Hawthorne's Blithedale Romance ), such misprints would indeed need to be treated as textual faults. But in general one cannot discount the possibility that it is a matter of a "second generation" misprint which the author may not have recognised as a misprint, but which he registered and built into the semiotic system, that is to say, he authorised it and therefore it cannot later be reversed. If one regards cases of this sort as dubious, they are decided according to the editorial measures which we are recommending in favour of the textus receptus. This has the additional advantage that it is this text which is essential for the history of influence and reception. A textual fault obliges the editor to intervene in the text. But emendation is only permitted in the edited text when the correction is unequivocal. In all other cases the textual fault or the gap in the text should be marked, that is to say, indicated by a mark in the text. Suggested improvements should be discussed in the apparatus. In order to comply with the rigorous requirements of text establishment, we recommend that simple corruptions of the text and mistakes (suspected compositor's errors and slips of the pen), which the author may have overlooked and which do not meet the definition of the textual fault, should also be marked in this way in the text or in the margin. Appropriate to the problematical nature of our edited texts is also, to my mind, a minimal apparatus of emendation at the foot of the page in the text, corresponding to the markings in the text. Both these technical measures are intended to draw the attention of the reader to problems of textual crticism and to possible solutions while he is reading the text; apart from this they provide a reference to the main apparatus. In this critical apparatus all problematical passages should be discussed in detail, which has not been usual in German editions, and this discussion should be modelled on such exemplary "textual notes" as are found, for instance, in the editions of Fredson Bowers.</field>

According to Greg in his fundamental contribution of 1950 ("The Rationale of Copy-Text", repr. in Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell, Oxford 1966), it is "the historical circumstances of the English language" (p. 384) which necessitate the distinction. I therefore leave this aspect out of consideration. 5 "Grundlagen der Goethe-Ausgabe, ausgearbeitet von Mitarbeitern der Goethe-Ausgabe." Circulated in MS. 43 fols., n.p., n.d. Based upon these "Grundlagen", discussing them and enlarging upon them, is Siegfried Scheibe's contribution, "Zu einigen Grundprinzipien einer historisch-kritischen Ausgabe", in Texte und Varianten, Probleme ihrer Edition und Interpretation , ed. Gunter Martens and Hans Zeller (Muenchen 1971), pp. 1-44. 6 See the systematic discussion in Fredson Bowers, "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text", The Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115, especially pp. 97ff. 7 Greg, Collected Papers , p. 387. 8 Cf. Fredson Bowers, "Current Theories of Copy-Text", in Modern Philology 48 (1950/51), p. 15, n. 15: One would need to determine "which method is likely to retain more authoritative readings than it rejects . . . in retaining the maximum possible number." — If quotations here and subsequently are almost exclusively from Fredson Bowers' articles and editions, the simple reason is that during the short time of my acquaintance with Anglo-American editing, so admirable a discipline in the eyes of a Germanist, the work of Fredson Bowers has been my main point of reference. This gives me the opportunity of expressing my deep respect for an editorial achievement which in my opinion does not have its equal by far in German studies. 9 Fredson Bowers, "Textual Introduction" to Maggie , in The University of Virginia Edition of the Works of Stephen Crane , I (Charlottesville 1969), p. xciii. 10 CEAA, Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures , rev. ed. (New York 1972), p. 6. 11 Georg Trakl, Dichtungen und Briefe . Historisch-kritische Ausgabe (Salzburg 1969), II, 226. 12 Friedrich Hölderlin, Sämtliche Werke , ed. Friedrich Beissner. Vol. II (Stuttgart 1951), 118, 667, 672 (H 1 , H 3 ). 13 In his article of 1950, W. W. Greg recommends a treatment of the textual witnesses of works of the English Renaissance in accordance with editorial practice customary for manuscript transmission, which raises the question of whether it is permissible at all to apply his principles under different transmissional circumstances: "In respect of substantive readings we have exactly the same liberty (and obligation) of choice as has a classical editor" ( Collected Papers , p. 377). Greg discusses R. B. McKerrow's editorial principles ( Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare [Oxford 1939], p. 17 f.) and states that where McKerrow had postulated that an editor accept " all the alterations" of a revised edition, he had "failed to add the equally important proviso that the alterations must also be of a piece (and not . . . of apparently disparate origin)", or "his canon is open to exactly the same objections as the 'most authoritative manuscript' theory in classical editing" (38of.). In the same context, Greg affirms that the "one important respect in which the editing of classical texts differs from that of English" is that the former normalise spelling (p. 375). The main difference therefore is seen to reside not in text constitution. It would seem to me that these remarks set out very clearly under what conditions alone Greg's principles, that is to say, the establishment of any given number of individual readings, should be considered as valid editorial guidance; namely, only in cases of radiating contaminated transmission, such as are the rule in texts with a mediaeval transmissional tradition, and, therefore, where it is the editorial aim to attain texts which are better than any extant textual witness. In texts, on the other hand, which have not already come upon us in radiating contaminated witnesses, but in such as contain distinct, albeit partly corrupt, versions, it is the editor, reconstructing a single version according to Greg's principles, who brings about the contamination. — The problem of contamination will be dealt with in section III. 14 This is emphasized in order to forestall the opinion that poetic language serves to express concepts and thoughts which might be enhanced and improved upon by revision. That this is not so will be further discussed in the following section. 15 Cf. Miroslav Cervenka, "Textologie und Semiotik", in Texte und Varianten , pp. 143-163, especially p. 152. — Clearly, it is essential to our present view and argument that works of literature function by virtue of manifold relationships between their elements. Just as clearly, such functionality does not become manifest in certain genres, or in works of limited length, only. The argument should be considered valid therefore not merely for lyrical poetry, but equally for narrative and dramatic works. The only reason for the exclusive reference here to lyrical texts is that in their relative brevity they can be more conveniently presented. An investigation on similar lines of the two versions of Gottfried Keller's Der grüne Heinrich , a novel in four books, has confirmed my views, but an account of the naturally much more complex conditions which obtain there and a discussion of the relationships revealed would by far exceed the scope of an example and of this article. An example in suitable isolation from Klopstock's gigantic epic in 20 cantos Der Messias is discussed by Elisabeth Höpker-Herberg, "Ausschnitte aus dem synoptischen Apparat zum 'Messias'", in Kolloquium über Probleme der Kommentierung im Freien Deutschen Hochstift, Frankfurt/M.

Oktober 1970), Referate und Diskussionsbeiträge (Bonn - Bad Godesberg 1971), pp. 103-104, 109; and by Christiane and Martin Boghardt, "Die Halleschen Messias -Drucke von 1751/1752", in Jahrbuch des Freien Deutschen Hochstifts 1971, pp. 3-4 (concerning Messias , canto II, 339 f.).

Leonhard (Frankfurt/M. 1962), pp. 180 f. — C. F. Meyer created a case in point when he twice corrected a sheet of the story "Angela Borgia", the first one having got temporarily lost in the printing shop. The two sets of revisions were made in immediate temporal succession. Nevertheless they are not identical: of a total of 36 changes (of which 23 are changes in substantive readings), only 16 occur in both copies (10 of which are substantive variants). See C. F. Meyer, Sämtliche Werke , XIV (Bern 1966). p. 311, 357-362. 42 We, that is the editors who were at the time engaged upon the Academy edition of Goethe in Berlin, the editors of the Hamburg Klopstock edition, and the editors of the works of Georg Heym. My conversations with all of them, and with Dr. Gunter Martens of Hamburg in particular, have helped considerably to clarify my own thoughts. 43 I take over the definition as given by Siegfried Scheibe on p. 28 of his 1971 article (see footnote 5). 44 The criterion of "sense" and text-specific logic is amply discussed on pp. 61-74 of my "Befund und Deutung" (see foot-note 28). 45 Georg Heym, Gesammelte Gedichte , ed.

Heym, Dichtungen und Schriften , I (1964), 318. — A similar example in Milton's "Comus", where numerous editors for internal reasons, and without foundation in bibliographical and transmissional fact, had introduced an erroneous conjecture, is referred to by J. Thorpe on p. 81 of "The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism" (see footnote 33).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">It is uncommon to be able to locate with any certainty the manuscript copy for any part of an Elizabethan printed book. But one instance where it is possible to do so with a high degree of certainty occurs in John Stowe's edition of Chaucer (1561). Among the poems attributed to Chaucer in this edition is the fifteenth-century Craft of Lovers . 1 Recent work for a critical edition of this poem now makes it possible to demonstrate that Stowe's edition derives from Trinity College, Cambridge MS R.3.19. And this demonstration offers some incidental insight into Stowe's editorial practices and his unreliability as an attributor.</field>

C profer: AH dispute Stowe had access to all three manuscripts, conceivably at the time when he was preparing his edition. 4 But a collation of S 1 against the manuscripts reveals that in all the instances noted above (and extensively elsewhere) S 1 follows C against AH. But there are slight indications that Stowe adopted readings from either A or H which he found superior to C. The following is a complete list of readings in S 1 which occur in A and/or H and not in C: 3. C be: AHS 1 ben 46. C wold: AHS 1 add not 55. C bondes: AHS 1 boundes 61. C drops: AHS 1 drope 99. C gay: AHS 1 add of 107. CA vnto: HS 1 to 144. C creature: AHS 1 creatures This does seem to suggest that Stowe did refer to at least one of the other manuscripts. But he does not seem to have done so on any systematic basis. In this case at least, his sense of his role as editor does not seem to have included any compulsion to choose critically between the alternative readings before him. 5 There remain however a number of unique readings in S 1 . The full list is: 8. C these: S 1 this 16. C intemerate: S 1 intenuate 36. C syr: S 1 adds your 39. C worldly: S 1 worldy 67. C erbe: S 1 eke 88. C carnall: S 1 cardnal 95. C lacken: S 1 lacke 143. C hygh: S 1 hight 150. C yow: S 1 your 151. C hert: S 1 her 159. C CCCC . . . : S 1 CCC . . . 160. C prepotent: S 1 portent It is of course a reasonable assumption that such unique readings are not likely to have any authority. A number appear to be printer's errors (e.g. 39, 95, 143, 151) and a number of others are manifestly nonsense and can probably be accounted for by the difficulty of either Stowe or the compositor with a hard or unfamiliar word (e.g. 16, 67, 88, 150, 160). Of the remaining readings one is clearly incorrect (8) and another (36) doubtless an editorial conjecture necessary to repair a lacuna in C and with which the other manuscripts would not give any help. 6 The final reading is perhaps the most interesting. At 159 'CCCC' is emended to 'CCC'. Opposite this line in C Stowe has noted that 'Chaucer died . 1400' (f. 156 v ). Clearly the emendation is an attempt to reconcile his text to accord with this fact. Stowe's fallibility as an attributor is well known; but it is rarely possible to document it in such a way. In sum then it seems clear that Stowe based his edition of the Craft of Lovers on Trinity R.3.19. There is some indication that he did adopt a few readings from either the Additional or Harley manuscripts. It also seems that in one case he employed his editorial role to suppress evidence that conflicted with his wish to attribute the poem to Chaucer. There is no logical necessity for assuming he had access to any additional manuscripts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It remains to consider the relationship between Stowe's edition and Speght's (1598), the only other black letter edition. It seems clear that Speght took his text directly from Stowe. His text contains all the unique variants of Stowe with the following exceptions: 8. S 1 this: S 2 these 39. S 1 worldy: S 2 worldly 151. S 1 her: S 2 hert which may be taken as the sort of reasonable conjectural restorations that an editor of Speght's abilities would be capable of making. 7 There are however three unique readings in Speght: 5. S 1 moral: S 2 mortal 26. S 1 so: S 2 do 143. S 1 hight: S 2 high It is possible the first is also an emendation by Speght. The other two are clearly compositorial errors. In any case there is no need to assume that Speght had access to any text other than Stowe's. Hence neither of the printed editions of the Craft of Lovers has any independent authority. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The poem consists (in the Trinity manuscript) of 23 rhyme royal stanzas. After its appearance in the editions of Stowe and Speght the poem was reprinted in the later editions of Chaucer by Urry (1721), Bell (1782), Anderson (1795) and Chalmers (1810). For full details see E. P. Hammond, Chaucer: A Bibliographical Manual (1908), pp. 119-136. Miss Hammond notes that Stowe's edition is 'probably from the Cambridge MS' (p. 420), but provides no further discussion or evidence. 2 Cf. C. Brown and R. H. Robbins, The Index of Middle English Verse (1943), no. 3761. 3 For discussion of these three manuscripts and their relationships in general terms see E. P. Hammond, "Two British Museum Manuscripts", Anglia , 28 (1908), 1-28, and A. I.

R. , 8 (1913), 538-539. 5 Stowe's conception of the editorial function warrants a separate study. For preliminary discussion illustrating his differing approaches to two texts by the same author see W. Ringler, "Lydgate's Serpent of Division , 1559, Edited by John Stow", SB , 14 (1961), 201-203 (where Stowe was content to use an earlier printed edition as copy); and A. S. G. Edwards and J. I. Miller, "John Stowe and Lydgate's St. Edmund ", N&amp;Q , 218 (1973), 365-369 (where it seems that Stowe made at least preliminary attempts at collation of a number of manuscripts). 6 This line in C reads: "What auayleth syr proclamacion"; in AH it reads: "What availeth sir suche demonstracioun". 7 Cf. the assessment of Speght as editor in G. Pace, "Speght's Chaucer and MS.

      <field name="heading_text">Authoritative Manuscript Corrections in Donne's Biathantos by Ernest Sullivan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. John Sparrow's article, "Manuscript Corrections in the Two Issues of Donne's Biathanatos, " The Book Collector , 21 (Spring, 1972), 29-32 1 describes three groups of manuscript corrections occurring in his copy of the first issue and his copy of the second issue of the first edition of Biathanatos . 2 First, in each copy of each issue on the first leaf (¶3) of the Epistle Dedicatory, 3 the following four manuscript corrections appear: " recto : last line the Treatise ] corrected to this Treatise / verso : . . . l. 6 writ,] corrected to writen [ sic ] 4 / l.16 al most] corrected to almost [ sic ] 5 / l.18 allarums] corrected to allarums)" (p. 29). Second, in only his second issue in the final lines of the Epistle Dedicatory, two manuscript corrections of the punctuation occur: sig. ¶4 v , l. 7 truth.] corrected to truth,; sig. ¶4 v , l. 8 morir .] corrected to morir , (p. 31). Finally, in only his first issue, we find the single manuscript correction in the body of the text of Biathanatos : sig. Ee2, l. 1 exacted] corrected to exalted (p. 30). From just the information that the corrections in the second group occur only in Mr. Sparrow's copy of the second issue and that the correction in the third group occurs only in his copy of the first issue, one could not determine whether the corrections in the second and third groups are authoritative or whether any of the groups of corrections are related; however, all seven of the manuscript corrections found by Mr. Sparrow in either his copy of the first issue or in his copy of the second issue also occur in a single copy of the first issue at the Yale University Library. These corrections in the Yale copy of the first issue in conjunction with those in Mr. Sparrow's copy of each issue prove that all of the corrections are authoritative and that these alterations probably represent an effort on the part of the younger Donne to have some copies of the first issue of Biathanatos corrected. Comparison of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory in Mr. Sparrow's copies with those in the Yale copy shows that a single emendator almost certainly made all six of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory. The corrections (on sigs. ¶3 and ¶3 v ) common to all three copies are identical and in the same hand; 6 thus, these four corrections were certainly made by one person. The two corrections in punctuation which appear on sig. ¶4 v in Mr. Sparrow's copy of the second issue (but not in his copy of the first issue) closely resemble (even in their exaggerated size) the corrections at the same place in the Yale copy of the first issue, and therefore these punctuation corrections were probably made by a single person, very likely the person who made the corrections on sigs. ¶3 and ¶3 v in the Epistle Dedicatory. The fact that Mr. Sparrow's copy of the first issue lacks these punctuation corrections would appear to lessen somewhat the probability that one person made all six corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory; however, the possibility that a single person, making all of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, carelessly omitted the two punctuation corrections on the final page of the Epistle Dedicatory in Mr. Sparrow's copy of the first issue seems more likely than the alternative possibility that some other person at a different time made these particular punctuation corrections in the same place with the same technique in two of the very copies having the other corrections. 7 Even though we cannot specifically identify the particular emendator, we do know that all of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory were quite likely made at the publishing house. Since all six of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory appear in a single copy (Yale) of the first issue, they must all have been made during the manufacture or sale of the first issue. According to Mr. Sparrow (pp. 30 and 31), all of these corrections (except the one on the recto of sig. ¶3, facing the cancel title page in his copy of the second issue) in both of his copies offset. All the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory of the Yale copy of the first issue also offset; hence, all six corrections were made at some time after the sheets of the first issue had been folded. Since the correction on the recto of sig. ¶3 did not offset on the cancel title page, we can reasonably assume that this correction (as well as the other corrections if made at the same time) 8 had been made before Humphrey Moseley substituted the cancel title page of the second issue. The fact that this correction on sig. ¶3 offset on sig. ¶2 v (except in Mr. Sparrow's copy of the second issue) also indicates that the corrections were made either immediately just before or sometime after sheet ¶ had been given its second and final folding in normal quarto order, suggesting that the corrections were made after the sheets were ready for binding. 9 The probability that the corrections on sig. ¶4 v (as well as those in the rest of the Epistle Dedicatory if also made at the same time) were made after the sheets had been bound or prepared for binding is further increased by the fact that the corrections on sig. ¶4 v offset on sig. (*) 1. We know that the settings on the recto and verso of sigs. (*) 1.2 were printed on the same sheet as the settings on the recto and verso of sigs. Ee1.2. 10 As I have shown in my dissertation (pp. 121-122), the settings of the rectos and versos of sigs. (*) 1, (*) 2, Ee1, and Ee2 were arranged in the formes so that after printing the sheet could be cut in half with each of the halves to be then folded once and placed in the appropriate location in the volume. Thus, the corrections on sig. ¶4 v could offset on sig. (*) 1 only if the sheets were in position for binding or already bound when the correction was made. The corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, then, were almost certainly made while the sheets of the first issue were in position for binding or already bound and before the sheets were reissued by Moseley. Since the six corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory were almost certainly made by a single emendator at a single point in time, they very likely have the same authority, and the nature of some of these corrections suggests that they are all authoritative. This near certainty that all of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory were made by the same person at the same time reasonably establishes that the changes represent a deliberate effort at correction rather than a random event or tampering by the owner(s). The corrections involving 'the', 'writ,', and the punctuation were not at all necessary or obvious (certainly the printer of the second edition, using the first edition as his copy, did not make them, although he did make a number of other corrections); therefore, these corrections probably derive from an Errata list (or, less likely, a manuscript copy of the Epistle Dedicatory) rather than from the mind of the emendator, and they (and the other corrections made with them) should all be authoritative. 11 The emendator of the Epistle Dedicatory may not have also made the correction from 'exacted' to 'exalted' on sig. Ee2 of the text of the Yale and Sparrow copies of the first issue, and we do not know when the correction was made, but this correction in the text of Biathanatos is very likely related to those in the Epistle Dedicatory and even more certainly authoritative. As Mr. Sparrow notes (p. 30), the correction on sig. Ee2 does not appear to be in the same hand as those corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory. The handwriting evidence is not conclusive, however, since the only letter offering direct comparison is an 'e'. 12 Unless, then, some as yet undiscovered examples of this correction on sig. Ee2 come to light in copies other than those also containing the manuscript corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, the case for a single emendator or a pair of emendators working together on a limited number of copies being responsible for all seven of the corrections seems more plausible than the case that the corrections on sig. Ee2 are unrelated to those in the Epistle Dedicatory. The authority of this correction on sig. Ee2 is even more certain than the authority of those corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, contrary to the implications of Mr. Sparrow's article. Mr. Sparrow notes (p. 30) that this correction is the only one in the body of the text of Biathanatos , that this correction does not occur in his copy of the second issue, and that this correction is in a different hand from those in the Epistle Dedicatory. Given only these three observations, one could not logically conclude that the correction was authoritative; in fact, one might suspect the opposite. Knowing, however, that the Yale copy of the first issue also has this correction at the same place in the body of the text of Biathanatos , we can assume that this correction was not a random event and probably not the work of the owner(s) of the books. 13 Since this change from 'exacted' to 'exalted' does not involve an obvious correction 14 (but does give a better reading), we can reasonably suspect that the correction did not originate in the mind of an emendator in the publisher's office. This correction also very likely derives from an Errata list; had the emendator been extensively checking the body of the text of Biathanatos in the first edition against the printer's manuscript (which closely resembled the Bodleian manuscript), 15 he undoubtedly would have made many more corrections in the first edition. Furthermore, the authority of the correction is strengthened by the fact that 'exalted' is the reading of the Bodleian manuscript at this point (p. 256, ll. 17-18), strongly implying that 'exalted' was also the reading in the printer's manuscript of Biathanatos . Thus, the correction from 'exacted' to 'exalted' also appears authoritative, even though perhaps inscribed by someone other than the emendator of the Epistle Dedicatory. Finally, the authority of all the corrections in the first edition of Biathanatos is enhanced by the existence of similar manuscript corrections in other seventeenth-century works. 16 The occasion for making the corrections cannot be precisely determined, but enough evidence exists to warrant conjecture that the younger Donne had the publisher make them. Because six of the seven corrections cluster in the Epistle Dedicatory, it would seem very possible that the younger Donne (who would have been especially interested in the correctness of the Epistle Dedicatory), 17 in looking over the Epistle Dedicatory after all of the sheets had been printed (and many probably bound or sold), noticed the apparent errors and called them to the attention of the publisher. Given also that (1) the only other correction occurs on sig. Ee2 and that (2) a sheet containing sig. Ee2 could easily have been adjacent to a sheet containing the Epistle Dedicatory at the publisher's (assuming that the preliminary materials were printed in the same order as they appear in the first edition and that the sheets at the publisher's were in the order in which they were printed), we can suspect that the younger Donne, in examining the Epistle Dedicatory, also glanced at the adjacent sheet (containing sigs. Ee1, Ee1 v , Ee2, Ee2 v , (*) 1, (*) 1 v , (*) 2, and (*) 2 v ) and happened to recognize the erroneous reading of 'exacted' (which, as the last word in the first line on sig. Ee2, would have been in a conspicuous location). Since the need for the correction of 'exacted' and the correct emendation to 'exalted' almost certainly would not be apparent to an average person from a glance at the sheet, and since we know that the correction was not the result of extensive checking of the first edition against the printer's manuscript, we can reasonably infer that someone acquainted with the text of Biathanatos , as was the younger Donne, initiated the correction. The presence of the corrections on both sheet ¶ (containing the Epistle Dedicatory) and the sheet containing sig. Ee2—which could have been seen together only while the sheets were in their uncut state—suggests that some time passed between the initial recognition of the need for correction and the actual making of the corrections, since the corrections could not have actually been made until after the sheet containing sigs. Ee1, Ee1 v , Ee2, Ee2 v , (*) 1, (*) 1 v , (*) 2, and (*) 2 v had been cut and folded and sig. (*) 1 (on which the corrections present on sig. ¶4 v offset) placed next to sig. ¶4 v . The occurrence of the corrections on sig. Ee2 in at least one fewer copy than the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory could be explained either as a simple omission by the emendator or by the younger Donne's reviewing the sheet containing the Epistle Dedicatory at two separate times and failing to notice the reading of 'exacted' until the second time, by which time at least the one copy had been removed from the publisher's. The presence of all the corrections in a single copy of the first issue, the near certain authority of the corrections, the clustering of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, the existence of the corrections (many in the same hand) in at least three copies of the first edition, and the likelihood that the need for the corrections was recognized before the sheet containing sig. Ee2 was cut even though the corrections were not actually made until after the sheets in these three copies had been cut and bound, all imply that the corrections represent an effort by the younger Donne, acting through the publisher, to improve the readings in some copies of the first issue. Although two of these seven manuscript corrections may appear trivial ('al most' to 'almost' and 'allarums' to 'allarums)'), and another ill-advised (' morir. ' to ' morir ,' immediately before the closing 'Your Lordships . . .'), two corrections do involve stylistic differences ('the' to 'this' and 'writ' to 'writen'), and two others yield clearly superior readings ('truth." to 'truth,' and 'exacted' to 'exalted'), the former creating a substantially different interpretation of the Epistle Dedicatory. Before the correction from 'truth.' to 'truth,' (l. 7) the phrase 'firme and established truth' (ll. 6-7) referred back to 'this Doctrine' (l. 6). As Mr. Sparrow argues (p. 31), 'this Doctrine' is undoubtedly an allusion to the 'Doctrine' of Donne's treatise, that suicide is not always a sin. In this context, the Epistle Dedicatory would seem to support the integrity of Donne's argument—an integrity that has been questioned at length in A. E. Malloch's unpublished dissertation, "A Critical Study of Donne's Biathanatos " (Toronto, 1958) and in Richard Hughes' The Progress of the Soul: The Interior Career of John Donne (1968). After the correction, however, the phrase 'firme and established truth' refers forward to the Spanish proverb, ' Da vida osar morir ' (l. 8). In the new context, then, the closing sentence of the Epistle Dedicatory need not be read as supporting the integrity of Donne's announced 'Doctrine'. These manuscript changes in the first edition of Biathanatos are relatively rare; they do not occur in the copies of the first issue of the first edition at CLUC, CSmH, DLC (ND 0332947), MH (Augustus Jessopp's copy), and NjP, or the copies of the second issue at the CSmH, L (George Thomason's copy), and NNUT. The second edition (1700), which almost certainly derives from a copy of the first edition that lacked the manuscript corrections, has 'almost' (probably from a copy of the first edition in which the hyphen printed) where the Sparrow and Yale copies have printed 'al most', and where all copies of the first edition have erroneously printed 'allarums' the second edition has changed the capitalization and added the necessary parenthesis, 'Allarums)'. Had the compositor of the second edition been using a copy of the first edition containing the corrections, he probably would have made the emendation from 'exacted' to 'exalted'. The relative rarity of the corrections could be caused by the younger Donne not checking the readings of the Epistle Dedicatory until after all the sheets had been printed; thus, by the time he could communicate the need for the corrections to the publisher and the publisher subsequently begin making the corrections, many of the sheets had been sold or distributed. A final problem posed by Mr. Sparrow in a note on page 31 ("how it was that the younger Donne, when he presented a copy [of Biathanatos ] to [Constantine] Huygens in 1649, was able to quote verbatim from a letter sent by his father to [Lord] Herbert more than thirty years before") can be solved by the knowledge that in 1642 Lord Herbert of Cherbury presented his manuscript copy of Biathanatos (containing the letter by Donne to Lord Herbert on the leaf of the title page) to the Bodleian Library, where the younger Donne surely would have had access to it. The younger Donne printed the letter on pages 20-21 of his edition of Letters to Severall Persons of Honour : written by John Donne (London: J. Flesher, 1651).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Reprinted in To Geoffrey Keynes (1972), pp. 65-68, 3 plates. 2 The quarto first edition was printed (with an undated title page) in 1647 by John Dawson. By late 1647, Humphrey Moseley had obtained the sheets of Dawson's undated issue and reissued these same sheets with a cancel title page bearing Moseley's name and dated 1648. The new title page is the only difference between the sheets of the two issues. Proofs of the identity of the printer, dates of publication, and the order of the issues may be found in pages 135-136 and 142-146 of my dissertation, "A Critical, Old-spelling Edition of John Donne's Biathanatos " (UCLA, 1973). 3 The Epistle Dedicatory, authored by the younger Donne, is addressed 'TO THE Right Honourable THE LORD PHILLIP HARBERT [Herbert],' Earl of Montgomery and fourth Earl of Pembroke (1584-1650), who, according to the DNB , "accepted the dedication of numerous books" (IX, 662). 4 No attempt appears to have been made to obliterate the comma (the letters 'en' have simply been written above the comma); thus, I retain the comma in my descriptions of this correction. 5 The correction more literally appears as 'al=most' and differs from the others under discussion in that it involves only an accidental failure of a type to print in some copies: copies of the first issue of the first edition at the Harvard University Library (MH: Augustus Jessopp's copy), Henry E. Huntington Library (CSmH), Library of Congress (DLC: ND 0332947), Princeton University Library (NjP), and William Andrews Clark Memorial Library (CLUC), as well as the second issue copies at the British Museum (L: George Thomason's copy), CSmH, and Union Theological Library (NNUT) all read 'al-most'. Hence (though it seems unlikely) this correction could have been made independently of the others and could derive from another copy of the first edition. The word 'al-most' is entirely on line 16; it is not hyphenated because split at the end of a line. 6 Mr. Sparrow's article contains (pp. 34-36) photographic reproductions of the corrections in the Dedicatory Epistle in his copies. 7 It is, of course, barely possible, as Mr. Sparrow's conjecture (see note 8) could imply, that two emendators worked on the Epistle Dedicatory (one making the corrections on sigs. ¶3 and ¶3 v and the other making those corrections on sig. ¶4 v ) or that a single emendator made the corrections at two separate points in time, but the facts that all of these corrections involve a single sheet, that, significantly, the corrections on sig. ¶4 v are on the same forme as those on sig. ¶3, and that the corrections were made at approximately the same time (as shown below) all suggest that these corrections would have been handled as a unit by a single emendator. 8 Because his copy of the first issue lacked the punctuation corrections on sig. ¶4 v , Mr. Sparrow conjectured that not all of the punctuation corrections were made at the same time as the other corrections: "If the corrections [in punctuation] in the concluding lines of the Dedication were made . . . by someone in the publisher's office, their absence from my copy of the earlier issue can only, it seems, be explained by supposing that some of the folded sheets had been corrected, and sold, before the mistake in the punctuation of 'truth.' was detected" (p. 32). Mr. Sparrow's conjecture could theoretically be correct if read to mean that the emendator began making the punctuation corrections sometime after the sheets of the first issue had been folded and positioned for binding and after the corrections on leaf ¶3 had been made on some copies of the first issue unavailable to the emendator while making the punctuation corrections (although the fact that his copy of the first issue lacks the corrections in punctuation could more reasonably be explained as a careless omission by the emendator), but the existence of the punctuation corrections in the Yale copy of the first issue means that his conjecture should not be read as implying that the differences between his copies result from any changes associated with the production or sale of the second issue. 9 According to Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), the final folding of sheets printed in the seventeenth century usually took place at the bindery (p. 147). The fact that the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory occur in more than one copy, offset (with the exception of that on sig. ¶3 of Mr. Sparrow's copy of the second issue) in a manner showing that the sheets had been folded for the final time, and do not appear in printed form in any of the copies of either issue of the first edition listed in note 5, reasonably establishes that these corrections do not represent a proof state of the text and therefore were not made during the printing of the first edition of Biathanatos . 10 See Geoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of Dr. John Donne , 4th ed. (1973), p. 119 and my dissertation, pp. 121-122. The text of Biathanatos ends on sig. Ee2 v , and sigs. (*) 1, (*) 1 v , (*) 2, and (*)2 v contain preliminary materials, specifically a list of 'Authors cited in this Booke.' 11 On the basis that (1) his two copies are from different provenances, (2) there is no list of Errata in the book, (3) some of the corrections are not obvious, and (4) the corrections are in the same hand, Mr. Sparrow (pp. 30-31) concludes that the corrections on sigs. ¶3 and ¶3 v probably derive from the editor's manuscript of the Epistle Dedicatory. He also speculates (p. 32) that the punctuation corrections on sig. ¶4 v were also made in the publisher's office, leaving the reader to infer that Mr. Sparrow also considered the punctuation corrections authoritative. 12 The method used for making the correction in the text does, however, also differ from the method used in the Epistle Dedicatory. In the text, 'exacted' is entirely blotted out and 'exalted' written in the margin, 'exacted' being the last word in the line. The emendator of the Epistle Dedicatory merely superimposed the corrections on the printed readings. 13 The inference that the manuscript correction on sig. Ee2 is not a random event is strengthened by the fact that this manuscript correction is the only correction in the text in the Sparrow and Yale copies of the first issue. 14 As with some of the corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory, the correction of 'exacted' to 'exalted' was not obvious enough for the printer of the second edition to make the emendation. The sentence in the first edition of Biathanatos reads as follows: "As to cure diseases by touch, or by charme, (both which one (h) excellent Chirurgian, and one (i) excellent philosopher, are of opinion may be done, because what vertue soever the heavens infuse into any creature, man, who is Al, is capable of, and being borne when that vertue is exacted, may receive a like impression, or may give it to a word, or character made at that instant, if he can understand the time) though these, I say be forbidden by divers Lawes, out of a Just prejudice that vulgar owners of such a vertue, would mis-imploy, it, yet none mislikes that the Kings of England &amp; France , should cure one sicknesse by such meanes, nor (k) that the Kings of Spaine should dispossess Dæmoniaque persons so, because Kings are justly presumed to use all their power to the glory of God; So is it fit, that this priviledge [suicide] of which we speak should be contracted and restrained" (pp. 216-217). 15 For a discussion of the similarities between the printer's manuscript copy of Biathanatos (a copy not known to be extant) and the Bodleian manuscript copy of Biathanatos , see pages 147-152 of my dissertation. The Bodleian manuscript, however, certainly did not serve as the printer's copy, and it is extremely unlikely that the correction from 'exacted' to 'exalted' derives from the Bodleian manuscript; the manuscript had been in the Bodleian since 1642, and the first edition was not published until 1647. I doubt that someone would check a single reading from a book being published in London with a manuscript at Oxford, and if he had extensively checked the readings of the first edition with the Bodleian manuscript, he probably would have made many other much more obviously needed changes. 16 G. Blakemore Evans, in Allan Holaday's The Plays of George Chapman : The Comedies : A Critical Edition (1970), describes (pp. 559-560) many such non-autograph but apparently authoritative manuscript corrections in four copies of George Eld's first edition of Chapman's The Memorable Maske (London, 1613). David F. Gladish, in his edition of Sir William Davenant's Gondibert (1971) lists (pp. xxix-xxx) and accepts the authority of the five non-autograph manuscript corrections in the single copies of The Preface to Gondibert (Paris: Mattieu Gvillemot, 1650) at MH and the Bibliotheque Nationale as well as one additional such manuscript correction present only in the MH copy. Geoffrey Keynes, in his A Bibliography of Sir Thomas Browne (1968), notes (p. 74) the presence of the non-autograph manuscript corrections in three copies of Browne's Hydriotaphia and Garden of Cyrus (London: for Hen. Brome, 1658) first described and accepted as authoritative by John Carter in his edition of Urne Buriall and the Garden of Cyrus (1958), p. 116. 17 In another example of a work (Thomas Dekker's Match Me in London ) in which corrections cluster in the dedication, Fredson Bowers, in The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker (1958), has argued that Dekker himself proofread the dedication and initiated the corrections (III, 259-261). In our case as well, the younger Donne certainly would have wanted to avoid any errors in his address to an important patron.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shaftesbury Cursed: Dryden's Revision of the Achitophel Lines by Edward L. Saslow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first edition of Absalom and Achitophel (November 1681) lacks sixteen lines to be found in the third (1681) and all subsequent editions, 1 four concerning Absalom (957-960) and these twelve in the portrait of Achitophel: So easie still it proves in Factious Times, With publick Zeal to cancel private Crimes: How safe is Treason, and how sacred ill, Where none can sin against the Peoples Will: Where Crouds can wink; and no offence be known, Since in anothers guilt they find their own. Yet, Fame deserv'd, no Enemy can grudge; The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge. In Israels Courts ne'r sat an Abbethdin With more discerning Eyes, or Hands more clean: Unbrib'd, unsought, the Wretched to redress; Swift of Dispatch, and easie of Access. (180-191) Within a few months a "Non-conformist Parson" claimed that Dryden had added the brief praise of Shaftesbury out of fear or cupidity. 2 Andrew Kippis in 1778 offered the absurd story that soon after the publication of the first edition Shaftesbury, as a governor of Charterhouse, gave Dryden's son Erasmus-Henry a scholarship, and that Dryden added ll. 188-191 to the third edition in gratitude. 3 The first useful comment was that of Noyes, who suggested that the twelve lines were in Dryden's "original draught" since "their absence occasions an abrupt and awkward transition." 4 Macdonald found "some confirmation" for Noyes' conjecture on bibliographic grounds: In the first edition, a folio in 2's, the lines would have come immediately after the last line on sig. C1 v (p. 6), and it is precisely at this point that the make up of the volume is odd. C1 is conjugate with A1 ("To the Reader") and is followed by an unsigned single leaf. 5 C1 v exists in four different states in which four misprints and an incorrect catchword have been progressively corrected. Some change, then, was made while the poem was in the press, and Macdonald concludes that "it does not seem possible to explain the bibliographical eccentricity of this edition by the mere excision at the last moment of the twelve lines; and the fact that the only wrong catchword in the pamphlet, 'Not' at the foot of p. 6, occurs here, may indicate that Dryden's text was not originally quite as it is in this edition or in final form." 6 I shall offer what I believe to be the most probable reconstruction of Dryden's original text, together with some brief comments upon it. First, however, it will be necessary to consider the reconstruction given by Professor Vinton Dearing in the recently published second volume of the California Dryden. 7 Professor Dearing believes that the first edition had the last six lines of the twelve (186-191) at the bottom of p. 6 and that it lacked both the first six (180-185) and the seven lines (173-179) that now precede them. Dryden presented the "first copy from the press" to Charles who objected to the six lines. Dryden "tears out C1, writes the [seven] new lines," to take up the space occupied by the cancelled 186-191, "and hands it to the printer. The compositor starts with this page, and when he comes to the foot turns it over, uses the first word on the front of the leaf ('Not') as catchword and resets the front of the leaf." 8 However Dryden "refuses to be censored. He also writes an address to the reader in which the penultimate paragraph makes much the same points" as the six lines had, and in the second edition he restores them and adds six more lines (180-185) "to improve the transition" between the seven new lines and the original six. As evidence that the ll. 173-179 are a late addition Dearing remarks on changes made in l. 179 in the first and third editions. Since the California volumes will be the standard edition of Dryden's works for many years to come, Dearing's argument requires careful consideration. The events that Dearing supposes are individually unlikely, and next to impossible collectively. Dryden presents this first copy to Charles without any contemporary recording the fact in a diary or letter. 9 Charles takes time from his other activities to read the thousand lines of the poem with sufficient care to single out ten (Dearing applies his argument to ll. 957-960 as well) that he finds objectionable. Although he commands that Dryden strike out: Yet, Fame deserv'd, no Enemy can grudge; The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge. In Israels Courts ne'r sat an Abbethdin With more discerning Eyes, or Hands more clean: Unbrib'd, unsought, the Wretched to redress; Swift of Dispatch, and easie of Access. (186-191) he is willing to let stand: Oh, had he been content to serve the Crown, With vertues only proper to the Gown; Or, had the rankness of the Soyl been freed From Cockle, that opprest the Noble seed: David , for him his tuneful Harp had strung, And Heaven had wanted one Immortal song. (192-197) Among the seven new lines that Dryden writes is the triplet on the breaking of the Triple Alliance (175-177). Thus Dearing holds that Dryden had omitted this important and well-known charge from his original portrait of Shaftesbury. 10 Nor do the changes in l. 179, the switching back and forth between "Patron" and "Patriott" and the substitution of "usurp'd" for "assum'd", indicate that ll. 173-179 are a late addition. "Patron" is simply a misprint—Macdonald saw this—that was corrected in the second state of the first edition, but which managed to find its way back into the third state before finally being eliminated in the fourth. "Usurp'd" is only one of a number of slight changes (cf. ll. 19, 235, 369, 381, 416, 482, 585, 665, 680, 688, 777, 846, 847, 882, 966) that Dryden introduced in the third edition. What Dearing has Dryden do next seems most unlikely of all. He adds an address to the reader in which he puts back into the work those ideas that he has just taken out at Charles's order and then restores the offending lines themselves at the very first opportunity. Dryden's loyalty to Charles, his diffidence, and his financial dependence on governmental favor in the early 1680's need no urging, and twice in his career he explicitly states that he has himself censored his writings in response to the disapproval (either actual or expected) of the great. In the dedication to Limberham Dryden writes that he has "taken a becoming care, that those things which offended on the stage, might be either altered, or omitted in the press; for their authority is, and shall be, ever sacred to me, as much absent as present, and in all alterations of their fortune, who for those reasons have stopped its further appearance on the theatre. And whatsoever hindrance it has been to me in point of profit, many of my friends can bear me witness, that I have not once murmured against that decree." His words in the dedication to King Arthur are even more interesting: "[N]ot to offend the present times, nor a government which has hitherto protected me, I have been obliged so much to alter the first design, and take away so many beauties from the writing, that it is now no more what it was formerly, than the present ship of the Royal Sovereign, after so often taking down and altering, is the vessel it was at the first building." 11 If Dryden would sacrifice the "beauties" of his opera to avoid offending William's government can we suppose that he would restore the six lines and offend Charles himself? Dryden's last minute change, I suggest, was the addition of lines 152-158 and 167-172. The obvious explanation for the four misprints on p. 6 is that proof was read before the original C1 was cancelled, and the cancellans C1 was not proofread until some sheets had been printed. Now of the errors on C1 v "Kold" (l. 153) and "Kody" (l. 157) are of particular interest. The compositor twice set a "K" for a "B", an error which would be readily explicable only if he were working from handwriting. But to say that these words were handwriting as the new C1 was being set is to say that they were being added to it, for the compositor would work from the print of the cancellandum if he could. If lines were being added to C1, then others were being eliminated to retain the normal number of lines per page. We may then suppose that the twelve lines were originally the last on C1 v and that the compositor, with or without instructions, removed them to provide the space he needed for the addition. As radical as this excision may seem to the modern reader, it did not obscure the sense of the poem, and indeed, the awkwardness it introduced remained unnoticed until Noyes's edition of 1909. 12 The addition must have included the couplet and triplet that contain the misprints and the couplet that lies between them: For close Designs and crooked Counsels fit; Sagacious, Bold, and Turbulent of wit: Restless, unfixt in Principles and Place; In Power unpleas'd, impatient of Disgrace. A fiery Soul, which working out its way, Fretted the Pigmy Body to decay: And o'r inform'd the Tenement of Clay. (152-158) But more than these seven lines must have been added. The addition totalled thirteen lines, since the cancellandum contained the triplet on the breaking of the Triple Alliance, and a page with a single triplet regularly has thirty-three lines rather than the thirty-four of the cancellans. Thus six more lines were added, and the only six that can be removed from the cancellans text without creating an obvious gap are these: Punish a Body which he could not please; Bankrupt of Life, yet Prodigal of Ease? And all to leave, what with his Toyl he won, To that unfeather'd, two Leg'd thing, a Son: Got, while his Soul did hudled Notions try; And born a shapeless Lump, like Anarchy. (167-172) Only this hypothesis or one very much like it will fit the facts of the case. As Dearing says, C1 is a cancellans. It was decided to cancel C1 before the preliminaries had been printed and for some reason, perhaps ease of binding, it was further decided to print "To the Reader" on A1 r-v and to use A2 for the cancellans C1, with B quired within the A1.C1 fold. The title page was then printed on π2 r and π1 was left blank. The original plan for printing the preliminaries was presumably to print the title page on A1 r and "To the Reader" on A2 r-v , as was done in the second edition, a folio in 2's which collates regularly [A] 2 B-I 2 . There is extremely strong evidence for this theory of cancellation. In the second edition, a page-for-page reprint, the title page ([A]1 r ), the first page of "To the Reader" ([A]2 r ), and lines 146-179, 523-1031 of the text (C1 v , F-I 2 ) were printed from the same settings of type as had been used in the first. 13 The only probable explanation for this state of affairs is that the text of the first edition was printed in order, that after the type for sheet E had been distributed it was decided to leave type standing for a second edition, and that the outer forme of A1.C1 was printed after this decision was made. 14 That C1 v was printed after E implies that C1 is a cancellans. The cancellation must have been of C1 only, with C2 remaining as the unsigned single leaf, for had the entire sheet been cancelled the volume would now collate regularly. This point is worth mentioning, since Macdonald was misled by the incorrectness of the catchword on C1 v into believing that C2 was the addition. Now C1 could not have been cancelled simply to remove the twelve lines, for the first six were unobjectionable. Hence Dearing is forced to complicate his hypothesis by supposing them a later addition. Further, if the last six were removed because of their meaning, why were they restored? What reason can be given for their removal that would not operate fully as powerfully against their restoration a few weeks later? If, however, the lines were cut simply to make room for others, both difficulties vanish; their meaning becomes almost irrelevant and their restoration desirable. 15 If I am correct, Dryden's description of Shaftesbury as first printed read: Of these the false Achitophel was first: A Name to all succeeding Ages Curst. 151 A daring Pilot in extremity; 159 Pleas'd with the Danger, when the Waves went high. He sought the Storms; but for a Calm unfit, Would Steer too nigh the Sands, to boast his Wit. Great Wits are sure to Madness near ally'd; And thin Partitions do their Bounds divide: Else, why should he, with Wealth and Honour blest, Refuse his Age the needful hours of Rest? 166 In Friendship False, Implacable in Hate: 173 Resolv'd to Ruine or to Rule the State. To Compass this the Triple Bond he broke; The Pillars of the publick Safety shook: And fitted Israel for a Foreign Yoke. Then, seiz'd with Fear, yet still affecting Fame, Assum'd a Patriott's All-attoning Name. So easie still it proves in Factious Times, With publick Zeal to cancel private Crimes: How safe is Treason, and how sacred ill, Where none can sin against the Peoples Will: Where Crouds can wink; and no offence be known, Since in anothers guilt they find their own. Yet, Fame deserv'd, no Enemy can grudge; The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge. In Israels Courts ne'r sat an Abbethdin With more discerning Eyes, or Hands more clean: Unbrib'd, unsought, the Wretched to redress; Swift of Dispatch, and easie of Access. Oh, had he been content to serve the Crown, With vertues only proper to the Gown; Or, had the rankness of the Soyl been freed From Cockle, that opprest the Noble seed: David , for him his tunefull Harp had strung, And Heaven had wanted one Immortal song. (150-151, 159-166, 173-197) The couplet before the first addition introduces Shaftesbury, the four couplets between the additions give a brief character of him, and those that follow the second addition sketch the preceding decade or so of his public career. The personal abuse of the final version is lacking, and in its absence the deftness of Dryden's original portrait is easily discerned. The introductory couplet does not say that Shaftesbury's will be "a name to all succeeding Ages Curst." What it does say is that the Biblical Achitophel's name was so cursed, as indeed it was long before Dryden set pen to paper. 16 Shaftesbury soon becomes Achitophel, but in strict logic Dryden's charge against him here is that "Achitophel" is a fit name for him. The character (ll. 159-166) does not so much balance or combine praise and blame as develop both together. By being what he is, Shaftesbury is at the same time a "daring Pilot in extremity" and "for a Calm unfit". It is this negative side of Shaftesbury's "wit" (l. 162) that Dryden goes on to develop in the next two couplets (ll. 163-166). Again notice what Dryden does not say. He does not call Shaftesbury mad. He suggests rather that as a "great wit"—and that description is in itself a compliment—Shaftesbury is so close to madness as to do a mad thing. This description of Shaftesbury meets the standard for satire that Dryden set in the Discourse on Satire (1692): How easy is it to call rogue and villain, and that wittily! But how hard to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave, without using any of those opprobrious terms! To spare the grossness of the names, and to do the thing yet more severely, is to draw a full face, and to make the nose and cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing. This is the mystery of that noble trade, which yet no master can teach to his apprentice; he may give the rules, but the scholar is never the nearer in his practice. Neither is it true, that this fineness of raillery is offensive. A witty man is tickled while he is hurt in this manner, and a fool feels it not. The occasion of an offence may possibly be given, but he cannot take it. 17 The additional thirteen lines are a lengthening at both ends of the original character of Shaftesbury. Unlike the earlier lines they are unambiguously and personally derogatory. They obscure the wit of the original character and destroy the function of Dryden's praise of Shaftesbury as Lord Chancellor. "The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge," Dryden had written, and it is as statesman that Shaftesbury is to be attacked throughout the rest of the poem. By praising him as judge and emphasizing the antithesis Dryden creates an appearance of fairness and hence gains a more ready belief for his attack. But the abuse of Shaftesbury's infirmities and of his son are of a different order than condemnation of his excessive wit and Machiavellian statesmanship, and in the final text praise and blame exist together but uncombined, like oil and water. 18 However, we should be sorry to lose the additional lines, and not simply for their intrinsic worth. The poem as a whole shows Achitophel to be guilty of such wickedness that we would wonder at a character of him which alleged no more than folly. Whether Dryden added the thirteen lines for this reason or for some other is a matter of speculation; that he did add the lines as the poem was going through the press is the most probable inference from the bibliographical and critical evidence before us. 19</field>

Unless we are to assume simple inadvertence, may it not be that the catchword "Not" was used so that the cancellans leaf would be sure to find its correct place, before the cancellandum (which would later be removed), when the gatherings were put together? 9 One place we might expect to have such a presentation mentioned is Richard Mulys' letter of November 19, 1681 to a member of the Duke of Ormond's household ( Historical Manuscripts Commission [of Great Britain], Ormonde , n.s., 6 [1911], 233). On Mulys' possession of "inside information" see Wallace Maurer, "Who Prompted Dryden to Write Absalom and Achitophel ?", PQ , 40 (1961), 131-132. 10 See Kenneth Harold Dobson Haley, The First Earl of Shaftesbury (1968), pp. 448, 511, 604. 11 The Works of John Dryden , ed. Sir Walter Scott, rev. George Saintsbury, VI (1883), 9-10; VIII (1884), 135. 12 James Kinsley, in fact, denies that any such awkwardness exists, The Poems of John Dryden (1958), IV, 1884. 13 See Macdonald, p. 23; Kinsley, IV, 1878; Calif. Works , II, 412. That C1 v (with the changes in the first line indicated in Calif. Works , II, 412, 416) was printed from the standing type of the first edition is my own observation based on a comparison of the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library copies of the first (first and third state) and second editions. 14 One explanation for why the type of only the outer forme of A1.C1 was left standing is that A1.C1 was printed, inner forme first, after E, and the decision to leave type standing was made after the type of the inner forme had been distributed. 15 " Almost irrelevant," because, presumably, a cut that destroyed the sense of its context would not have been made. 16 R. F. Jones, "The Originality of Absalom and Achitophel ," MLN , 44 (1931), 211-218. 17 Scott-Saintsbury edition, XIII (1887), 98. 18 A. L. French, "Dryden, Marvell and Political Poetry," SEL , 8 (1968), 403-404, makes a similar point. 19 The reader may wonder at the shift in tone between l. 166 and l. 173, which follows it in my reconstruction. Perhaps the character of Shaftesbury (ll. 159-166) was itself absent from the earliest draft of the poem. Monmouth has no formal character, and in The Medal Dryden was content to delineate Shaftesbury by recounting his career, as he does in ll. 173-197 here. If Dryden had not originally given a character of Shaftesbury it would be logical for him to decide to add one after writing those of the leading Whigs, French's challenge to the unity of the Achitophel lines ( loc. cit. ), if accepted, would offer some support to this hypothesis of double revision.</field>

When these completed projects fail to receive critical approbation, Sawney laments: O dire Reverse of Fate! O dreadful Doom!

They summon " Envy " and " Fraud " (28), who are told to conspire with " Fancy " to retrieve the situation. " Fancy " is sympathetic to Sawney's dilemma, but the only one of her demons who will help is " Curiosity " (37). One of Sawney's cohorts, " Shameless ," is angry that this is all the assistance Fancy will give, and he determines upon a " Lampoon " to save Sawney's face (40). So Sawney writes the Dunciad .

The Base Gives way, and, with a hideous Rumble, down The Building falls, and in its Ruins, heaps The Idol there adored: But, as they gaze On the subverted Frame, a rising Cloud Ascends, till all is vanish'd like a Mist, Before the Wind, away: No more the Crowd Of Witlings pay their empty vows, no more The Beaus , the Ladies , worship at his Shrine , But sneering Satyrs haunt the abandon'd Waste, And dance in Triumph round; while SAWNEY, lost In Anger, and Vexation, at his melted Fame, Snarls at Mankind, and takes a final Leap Into the vast Profund . . .

      <field name="fulltext">The tone varies throughout the six cantos, and at times comes close to a genuine solemnity. But The Harlot's Progress is essentially a mock-heroic poem. The following passage, which describes the heroine's response to falling out of favour with an "old Letcher" called Francisco, is typical of the author's style: What she should do in this disast'rous Place, She next resolves, and mourns her hapless Case, Raves, frets, and weeps, and tears her lovely Hair, And seems quite lost in Sorrow and Despair. A thousand Thoughts torment her anxious Breast, Rack her poor Heart, and rob her of her Rest; This Way and that she roves from Room to Room, But finds no Refuge from impending Doom. [p. 11] We follow the progress of her brief life as a prostitute until her final sickness and death. At her funeral, Chloe, a former friend and colleague, utters a passionate lament: With Hands up-lifted, O! what Change she cries, Pale are those lovely Cheeks, and clos'd those Eyes. Whose pleasing Fires did ev'ry Youth enflame, Whose Lightning darken'd Love where'er it came. How marr'd that beauteous Skin, whose Lilly White, Fill'd ev'ry Eye with Wonder and Delight. Unhappy Nymph! Thee did I dearly love, Ne'er shall thy Image from my Heart remove. O cruel Death! couldst not thou find a Prey, Who sought thy Dart, and curs'd thy dull Delay. But thou must strike my Friend, in whom was seen Each tempting Grace, and fair as Beauty's Queen. By all the Brave was her lov'd Converse sought, To her the Rich and Great their Offerings brought.

This Feast (and Fasting) is their Duty, The Doctor , only, reaps the Booty ; But recommends to them the Tryal, Of Abstinence , and Self-Denial .

      <field name="heading_text">The "Swingeing" of Cibber: The Suppression of the First Edition of The Refusal by Rodney L. Hayley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two editions of Colley Cibber's comedy The Refusal; or, the Ladies Philosophy appeared in 1721. The play was first issued in quarto (Q1) as the last part of Volume II of Cibber's Plays , both volumes of which were delivered to subscribers on July 1 of that year. 1 In mid-November an octavo edition (O1) of The Refusal was released. 2 This edition consists of two issues, one dated 1721, the other 1722. 3 Despite the difference in dates they were, as I shall discuss below, issued simultaneously. The collational formula of O1 (1721) is A 4 B-H 8 G 4 , with the text ending on G3 r , and advertisements for books printed by B. Lintot, W. Mears, and W. Chetwood occupying G3 v , G4 r , and G4 v respectively. The 1722 issue is identical, except in three respects. In the first place, its G3 leaf is a cancel: the text on G3 r is exactly the same as that printed on the corresponding page of the 1721 issue, with only the tail-ornaments differing; furthermore, on G3 v of the 1722 issue appear advertisements not for Lintot, but for T. Woodward. Secondly, there is no G4 leaf in the 1722 issue. And thirdly, the 1722 title-page, also a cancel, differs in certain details from the title-page of the 1721 issue. The latter issue, according to its title-page, was printed (like Volume II of the quarto Plays ) 4 by Lintot, Mears, and Chetwood in 1721. The title-page of O1 (1722), on the other hand, bears the imprint, "Printed for W. MEARS, . . . W. CHETWOOD, . . . T. WOODWARD, . . . and sold by J. ROBERTS . . . M.DCC.XXII." It also gives the additional information, "Where may be had Mr. CIBBER'S Works, two Volumes, Quarto , Royal Paper." Surprisingly, newspaper advertisements appearing at the time O1 was first issued name as its printers and sellers those listed on the 1722 issue title-page. 5 Moreover, the advertisements in O1 (1721) hint at a much earlier date of printing than one would expect, given that the octavo was released in November of 1721. For example, in The Daily Courant for October 6 Lintot advertises the publication of the seventh edition of Pope's Essay on Criticism , and the fourth edition of his Ode for Musick on St. Cœcilia's Day ; yet on G3 v of O1 (1721), Lintot advertises the fifth edition of the former work, and the third of the latter. Another seeming anomaly is presented by the fact that O1's collation (the text begins on B1, with the preliminaries ending on A4 v , apparently printed last) suggests that the edition was set from manuscript, 6 and not from the earlier-issued quarto as one would expect. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that Q1 was printed from manuscript: its preliminaries begin on the sheet which completes the preceding work in the Plays collection, occupying leaves 3A3 to 3B1 (the text begins on 3B2.) 7 All these apparently incongruous details can be reconciled, if we assume that Q1, although issued some four and a half months prior to O1, in fact derived from it. A collation of the two editions proves the validity of such an assumption. 8 The two are very similar: the comparison reveals, however, an attempt on the part of Q1's compositors to regularize O1's accidentals, and to correct obvious errors; the few substantive variants in Q1 appear to be attempts to improve the printer's copy, though sometimes the "corrections" pervert the author's intention. For example, Witling's familiar form of address in O1 for Sir Gilbert Wrangle—"Sir Gil. "—was surely intended by Cibber, who is throughout the play bent on delineating the fop's insolent familiarity; but the Q1 compositor, thinking "Gil." to be merely a space-saving contraction, expands it to " Gilbert ." 9 Another such "correction" provides more definite proof of Q1's derivation from O1. In O1, lines 28-36 on D1 v read as follows: L. W. The Wisdom of our Ancestors restrain'd such horrid Licences; and, you see, the Laws they made, describ'd them all by the modest Term of Spinsters only. L. W. But! I'll take care of her at least; and since she is become a publick Mischief, to humble her will be a publick Good: I'll send to Mr. Witling this moment, and invite him to dine here. I desire you will be in the way, Child, and assist me in bringing this Matter to a speedy Conclusion. Exit. The above passage is obviously corrupt: probably a speech by Sophronia (with whom Lady Wrangle is conversing in this scene) has been omitted by the compositor. In Q1, the two speeches by Lady Wrangle are joined into one (the exclamation "But!" becomes "But", thus smoothing the transition, and the second speech prefix is dropped). If we assume O1 derives from Q1, we have also to assume that the O1 compositor chose to break up what seems in his conjectured copy a perfectly correct passage, giving each of these newly-formed speeches to the same character, Lady Wrangle. I would suggest such an assumption is at best highly unlikely (nowhere else in O1 do we detect any sign of such irresponsible creativity on the part of the compositors). If, however, we reverse the situation, and assume that Q1 derives from O1, an explanation for the difference between the two texts becomes readily apparent. The Q1 compositor, taking great care to produce adequate texts for the expensive Plays , 10 decided the two consecutive speeches by Lady Wrangle in O1, his copy, were simply one speech, and accordingly considered joining the two to be merely a routine correction. Once we have decided on the order of O1 and Q1, a more puzzling problem arises: why was O1, though indeed the first edition, not published until some four and a half months after the second? To explain this bibliographic anomaly one must examine the events leading up to, and following, the production of the play. On January 10, 11, and 12, 1720/1, Lincoln's Inn Fields presented No Fools Like Wits , 11 which the Compleat List of all the English Dramatic Poets (1747) attributes to John Gay, observing of the play: "It is an Alteration of a Comedy called the Female Vertuosoes ; and acted against Mr. Cibber's Refusal , which was partly taken from the same Play." 12 Cibber's Refusal in fact was not to appear on the Drury Lane boards until February 14, but it was completed as early as January 16, and was probably well known to Gay. 13 His revision of Thomas Wright's old play, with its similar plot to Cibber's, was no doubt intended to expose Cibber as a plagiarist. 14 At this point, the notorious bookseller and printer Edmund Curll joined the skirmish, advertising in the newspapers "No Fools like Wits: Or, the Female Vertuosoes. A Comedy. As it is now Acting at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. By Mr. Wright." 15 Then early in February, a week before The Refusal was to be produced, Curll decided to cash in on Cibber's as well as Gay's profits: in The Post-Boy for February 7-9 he announced, "Next Week will publish'd in 8vo. the 2nd Edit. of No Fools like Wits, a Comedy; wherein will be marked the Passages which Mr. Cibber has borrow'd from Moliere in his Refusal, or the Ladies Philosophy." With such unfavourable advance publicity, it is not surprising that the actual production of The Refusal was a failure: after a tempestuous six-day run, from February 14-20, the play was finally forced off the stage. According to one contemporary account, "Mr. Cibber 's Enemies shew'd themselves very warmly at the Representation of this Piece, and I think without much Discretion; for they began to hiss it before they had heard it, and I remember very well, began their Uproar, on the first Night, as soon as he appeared to speak the Prologue. However it went on for six Nights, not without Disturbances every one of them." 16 Cibber's "plagiarism" in The Refusal was by now a well-known joke in the town. On February 18, Mist's Weekly Journal or Saturday's Post commented sarcastically on the play's genealogy: On Tuesday Night last at the Theatre in Drury-Lane, was acted a Comedy, called the Refusal, or the Ladies Philosophy, which was stolen from a Comedy lately acted in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, no Fools like Wits, which was stolen from a Comedy called The Female Virtuoso's, which was stolen from a Comedy of Moliere, called Les Femmes Scavantes . Such Authors as this Mr, D[enni]s says are fed like Hogs in Westphalia, one is tied to the Tail of another, and the last feeds only upon the Excrements of the rest, and therefore is generally, when full grown, no bigger than a Pig. 17 Curll's campaign against Cibber now began to gather momentum. Shortly after the opening of The Refusal Curll released an edition with the imposing title No Fools like Wits: Or, The Female Vertuosoes. A Comedy As it was Acted at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields. Or, The Refusal: Or, The Ladies Philosophy. As it is Acted at the Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane. The Second Edition . 18 Despite its title, this work was neither Gay's recently-acted play, nor Cibber's; rather, it was merely a verbatim reprint of Wright's 1693 Female Vertuoso's . Curll even includes the 1693 cast-list, and the original dedication (perhaps because in it Wright acknowledges his debt to Molière). In fact, the amusing title-page, a list of the " Cibberiz'd " equivalents to Wright's characters, and a satirical dedication to Cibber comprise the only new material in Curll's edition. In this dedication "To Mr. Cibber" (dated February 15), Curll satirizes both Cibber and the reviver responsible for the Lincoln's Inn Fields production 19 for their plagiarism and lack of art. Though Curll admits on the title-page "His Title , not his Play , we set to Sale," it is plain that he wished not only to satirize Cibber, but to confuse the buying public into thinking his edition reproduced the text of Cibber's play. In the course of the next three months Curll regularly inserted large eye-catching advertisements in the newspapers for his edition of Wright's play—with the part of the title stolen from Cibber usually featured more prominently than the rest. 20 Sometime during this period Lintot, Mears, and Chetwood printed The Refusal in octavo, but faced with the advertising campaign for Curll's "pirate" version, they decided to hold back publication until a more advantageous time. By the beginning of July the two-volume Plays was ready to be delivered to its subscribers, and thereafter was offered to the general public. Although Curll's advertisements for his Refusal had ceased, it still seemed unwise to release the octavo edition: Cibber and his printers did not want the Q1 and O1 editions to compete on the same market—at least not until the bulk of the very expensive Plays had been sold. 21 Nothing more was heard from Curll until October 7; on that date Mist's Weekly Journal printed an amusing letter from him to the editor, in which the bookseller boasted of his dishonest trade practices, and specifically referred to their damaging effect on Cibber: I need not tell you Trading is dull, Times bad, or any other melancholly Tale; you know very well, if there were any Business stirring, I would have my Share of it. I have the most savoury Collection of sweet Letchery that ever appeared in Print, yet though nothing fits the Taste of the Times better, tho' the Town swarms with Sectaries, I scarce clear enough by it to pay Shop-Rent. The Beau Sonneteers have quitted poetical Numbers for arithmetical ones, and if they should write, the fine Gentlemen and Ladies, their Readers, have turned their Imaginations from considering Similitude, Propriety and Cadence, to Differences and Refusals. In short, Sir, there are no Authors now who are so generous as to bestow their Works, nor any, that I can find, able to keep a Servant, who might, for a small Gratuity, steal them. For my Part, I have a natural Aversion to Copy-Money; I never Paid for any Copy but one I had at Westminster , at a very smart Price. 22 Since I have been bereft of my dear Authors, I have attempted to write in propria persona . . . . The allusions to his Refusal are unmistakable: by means of this pirate, he asserts, he "swinged off Colley very handsomely." Cibber, eager as always to get in the last word, quickly responded to Curll's letter. 23 " My Dear ," he writes, "Thine to Nat. Mist I have this Day perused, and am hugely delighted with it." But, he continues merrily, "Though I have been heartily swinged by thee, I take it unkindly at thy Hands, that thou shouldst insult over my Chastisement, when I took my Correction so patiently." Cibber's laughter was no doubt genuine. In this minor engagement between two of Pope's dunces, Curll was the aggressor, but Cibber clearly the victor. It is unlikely that Curll succeeded either in embarrassing Cibber, or in reducing his profits. Certainly he forced Cibber's printers to withhold the first edition of The Refusal —and the resulting delay could have been costly. The play featured the machinations of an unscrupulous South Sea director; by November of 1721, when the octavo was finally released, the controversy surrounding the bursting of the Bubble—an extremely hot issue when the play was originally acted—had died down to a certain extent. The vigorous advertising campaign carried on in the newspapers announcing the publishing of O1 may or may not have succeeded in stimulating sales. 24 But the existence of the issue dated 1722 does not necessarily prove that sales dragged on into the following year. As the newspaper advertisements indicate, the 1721 and 1722 issues were published simultaneously. When the octavo was released Lintot had already sold his share in the copy to Woodward (in November and December, 1721, advertisements were jointly placed by Mears, Chetwood, and Woodward for the octavo; during the same period Lintot advertises the Plays , but not the octavo edition of The Refusal ). In order to make known his interest in the copy Woodward cancelled the title-page of O1 (1721), replacing it with one which substituted his name for Lintot's; at the same time he replaced the advertisements for Lintot, Mears, and Chetwood with his own. Since the cancellans title-page was printed late in 1721 it was given the date 1722 as a matter of course. 25 The octavo was not, to my knowledge, advertised in the 1722 papers, by any of its printers, though this fact does not, of course, prove that the edition sold out in 1721. But in any case, it is very likely that receipts from the quarto Plays (which included The Refusal ) more than made up for any possible reduction in anticipated profits from the octavo. Davies tells us that Cibber made "a considerable sum" from the sale of the Plays 26 —a fact which helps to explain Cibber's good humour in his letter to Curll. And finally, if Curll hoped to divert Cibber's expected revenues from The Refusal to himself, he was to be sadly disillusioned. By his own testimony, receipts from his pirate Refusal were negligible: "humbled by Adversity," he had to admit in his letter to Mist that the "swingeing" of Cibber, however enjoyable at the time, had in the end brought him "nothing but waste Paper." 27</field>

I have examined the Bodleian, Cambridge, and BM copies of O1 (1721), as well as Xerox and microfilm copies obtained from the Texas, Pennsylvania, Yale, Harvard, Chicago, Princeton, Huntington, Folger Shakespeare, and Newberry libraries. I have examined only a single copy (belonging to the John Rylands library) of the rarer 1722 issue, but the Newberry, Wisconsin, Yale, Chicago, and Northwestern libraries kindly provided bibliographic descriptions of their copies. 4 According to its title-page, Volume I was also printed by Jacob Tonson. 5 The Post-Boy , November 9-11, 11-14, 14-16, and December 16-19; also The Daily Courant , November 10, 13, 15, 17, and December 18, 20. 6 See R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), pp. 188-189. 7 Ibid. , pp. 189-190. 8 I have collated thirteen copies of O1 (listed in note 3), and eight copies of Q1 (BM, Bodleian, Cambridge, Leicester, Rutgers, Pennsylvania State, Kentucky, and Stanford). 9 In both Q1 and O1 the speech prefix consistently used for Sir Gilbert is "Sir Gilb ." 10 In John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (1812), I, 217, the 1721 Plays are described as "beautifully printed." 11 London Stage , Part 2, 1700-1729, ed. Emmett L. Avery (1960), p. 608. The play was apparently never published: see William H. Irving, John Gay, Favorite of the Wits (1940), p. 189. 12 Probably by John Mottley, the List was appended to Thomas Whincop's Scanderbeg (1747). Mottley's testimony is not entirely correct: though Cibber's Refusal is, like Thomas Wright's Female Vertuoso's (1693), an adaptation of Molière's Les Femmes Sçavantes , it is not "partly taken" from Wright's play, but rather derives independently from the common Molière source. Mottley's word on the question of Gay's authorship, however, has been generally accepted. D. E. Baker ( The Companion to the Playhouse [1764], I, s. v. , No Fools Like Wits ) also gives the play to Gay, and agrees it was acted "in Opposition to Mr. Cibber's Refusal ." These details are followed by the revised Biographia Dramatica (1812), III, 86; Irving ( op. cit. , p. 188) also accepts the attribution, though he argues that Gay's version must have contained more original material than the Biographia Dramatica seems to imply. 13 The Daily Post for January 16 announced a subscription for "Two Volumes of PLAYS, Written by Mr. Cibber . . . Vol. II containing . . . V. The Refusal; or, The Ladies Philosophy; a new Comedy now in Rehearsal." 14 Gay and Cibber had long been enemies: for the background to their quarrel, and for Cibber's satire in The Refusal on Gay and his friends, see my note, "The Scriblerians and the South Sea Bubble: a Hit by Cibber," R.E.S. , 24, No. 96 (1973), 452-458. 15 The Post-Boy , January 12-14, and 17-19. 16 Mottley's List , p. 197. The playhouse disturbances were probably connected with politics: cf. Baker, op. cit. , I, s. v. , The Refusal ; John Genest, Some Account of the English Stage from the Restoration in 1660 to 1830 (1832), III, 49; and Cibber's Apology , ed. R. W. Lowe (1889), II, 189. 17 John Dennis was to continue his attack on The Refusal in The Causes of the Decay and Defects of Dramatic Poetry (1725?): see The Critical Works of John Dennis , ed. Edward Niles Hooker (1943), II, 281. 18 If indeed there was a "first edition" of this work it is apparently not extant. According to Ralph Straus ( The Unspeakable Curll: Being some Account of Edmund Curll, Bookseller; to which is added a full List of his Books [1927], p. 245) Curll had reprinted Wright's play in 1717, entitling it The Female Virtuosoes, or Witty Ladies . Straus comments vaguely, "I am not sure of the date of this first (Curll) edition. I am not even certain that the title is correct. Breval seems to have had something to do with it." I have been unable to locate a copy of this work. 19 It is significant that the BM's copy of Curll's edition was originally owned by John Gay. 20 See The Post-Boy for February 23-25, and March 9-11; The Daily Post for April 28, May 5; The Daily Courant , May 10, 17. 21 The cost of a subscription to the Plays was not advertised, but later the two-volume set retailed for the large sum of "1 l. 15 s." (see The Daily Post , February 2, 1722). The lushness of the edition, "Gold besmear'd / In Quarto Royal ," with "fair vermillion'd Leaves" was ridiculed in The Weekly Journal or Saturday's Post for March 3, 1722. 22 Curll here alludes either to his jailing in 1716, ordered by Westminster after he printed an unauthorized version of Winton's state trial, or to the drubbing given him in the same year by the boys of Westminster School (he had printed without permission an oration by the School's Captain on the death of Dr. Robert South). See Straus, op. cit. , pp. 65-76. 23 Though his letter was not published in Mist's Journal until November 25. Mist apologized for the delay in a prefatory note to Cibber's letter and Curll's rejoinder (both apparently sent in to Mist by Curll): "I heartily beg Pardon of my good Friend Mr. C—rll , for delaying the Publication of two little Epistles he was so kind as to send me, to adorn my Journal with; assuring him, this Misfortune is owing entirely to an Excess of Care, in laying up these Letters so safely that I have not been able to find them again, till after a Month's strict Search; and not to any Negligence in obeying his Commands, which I shall always receive with Pleasure." 24 Cf. note 5. 25 According to Nichols ( Literary Anecdotes , III, 249n.), "The Rule in general observed among Printers is, that when a Book happens not to be ready for publication before November, the date of the ensuing year is used." It is observable that some printers followed this practice at the time the octavo Refusal was issued; for example, S. Briscoe's edition of Sedley's Works , advertised as "This Day is publish'd" in The Post-Boy for December 2-5, 1721, bears the date 1722 on its title-page (BM copy). 26 Thomas Davies, Dramatic Miscellanies (1784), III, 476. 27 As late as 1728 Curll still had the play in stock: in his "Catalogue" appended to The Poetical Works of Mr. William Pattison (1728), Curll advertises, " No Fools like Wits ; (or, the Refusal :) Or, The Ladies Philosophy . A Comedy as acted at the Theatre-Royal ."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Piracies of Two Plays by Farquhar by Shirley Strum Kenny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sometime around 1733 one of the most smoothly professional pirates ever to abuse the English book trade perpetrated a number of unauthorized editions of old plays. Obviously pirates of the mid-eighteenth century, as those of any other period, sought anonymity, but while they spent considerable effort on hiding their own identity, they seldom attempted to disguise their books as legitimate editions. A pirate's imprint might either be false or vague—"Printed for the Booksellers of Town and Country"; and he might even legitimize his work by actually printing it abroad outside the limits of English copyright. He might crudely imitate an engraving, but an imitation was at the very most a half-hearted effort to foist his product off as the one that he imitated. Pirates wanted profits, and they wanted anonymity to protect them from the law, but they cared little for the odor of authenticity. The pirate now under discussion is obviously of a different breed. In 1948 Giles E. Dawson was the first to identify any of his remarkable handiwork. The counterfeit editions of Hamlet , 1723, Othello , 1774, and Macbeth , 1729, all of which appear in the first volume of a Folger Shakespeare Library copy of The English Theatre of 1731-33, a collection of old plays published by William Feales, are astonishingly similar to the originals; ornaments are copied with exquisite care, and the placement of signatures and press figures is calculatedly close to those of the edition that was imitated. 1 In 1955 D. F. Foxon found another specimen of the counterfeiter's handiwork, a piracy of the 1732 edition of Steele's The Lying Lover , which, while not so close an imitation as the Shakespearean piracies in matters of placement of signature and inclusion of press figures, still contains careful forgeries of the individual factotums, headpieces, and tailpieces of the original. The pirated Lying Lover was discovered in another copy of The English Theatre , and as Dawson had believed Feales a prime suspect, Foxon felt his discovery tied Feales, albeit on circumstantial evidence, even more closely to the piracies. 2 What is remarkable about these piracies and what links them without question is the trouble the pirate took to disguise his copies of the plays as authentic editions published by legitimate booksellers. I have acquired copies of two more piracies, obviously by the same hand, imitations of the 1733 editions of George Farquhar's The Beaux' Stratagem and The Recruiting Officer . The Folger Shakespeare Library has a copy of the same pirated Beaux' Stratagem in a collection of plays shelfmarked PR1241 S4 Cage. Although the piracies of Farquhar's plays do not reveal the identity or for that matter the motivation of the industrious pirate, I have found evidence to make me suspect that Feales may have been falsely accused by his twentieth-century investigators. The two Farquhar forgeries provide new information on the pirate's technique and his single-mindedness, and they serve as a reminder that there are probably a good many more piracies circa 1733 sitting respectably undetected in rare book collections. The legitimate "Eighth Edition" of The Beaux' Stratagem was published with the imprint: ' LONDON: | Printed for Bernard Lintot; and sold by | W. Feales, at Rowe's-Head , against St. Clement 's | Church in the Strand . | [short rule] M.dcc.xxxiii.' It was a page-by-page reprint of the 1730 "Seventh Edition" with the imprint ' LONDON: | Printed for Bernard Lintot, at the Cross-Keys , | between the Temple-Gates , in Fleetstreet . | [short rule] | M. dcc xxx.' It included as frontispiece an engraving from a plate used as early as Lintot's edition of 1714, used later in the 1730 edition, and reused again in the 1736 edition, which bears the imprint ' LONDON: | Printed for Bernard Lintot; and sold by | W. Feales, at Rowe's Head , the Corner of Essex-|Street in the Strand . | [short rule] | M. DCC.XXXVI.' [' LONDON: ' and date in red.] An ornamental initial on p. 5 of the 1733 edition reappears on p. 84 of the 1736 edition, and collation proves that the 1736 edition derived from the legitimate 1733 edition. The legitimate "Eleventh Edition" of The Recruiting Officer carries the imprint ' LONDON: | Printed for Bernard Lintot; and sold by | W. Feales, at Rowe's-Head , against St. Clement's | Church in the Strand . | [short rule] | M.dcc.xxxiii.' It is a reprint of the "Tenth Edition," published by Lintot in 1723, and it contains an engraving from a plate used in that edition. The engraving was reused later in Lintot's edition of 1736, which bears the imprint ' LONDON: | Printed for Bernard Lintot; and sold by | W. Feales, at Rowe-Head , the Corner of Essex-|Street in the Strand . | [short rule] | M.DCC.XXXVI.' [' LONDON: ' and date in red.] The text of the 1736 edition derives from the legitimate 1733 edition rather than the piracy. The piracies of The Recruiting Officer and The Beaux' Stratagem are page-by-page reprints of the legitimate editions of 1733 with almost identical title-pages, but they do not follow the originals line by line; both have some differences in lineation on about half the pages. What is remarkable about the piracies, however, is not the setting of the text, but the care with which the engravings and carved ornaments were imitated by the collaborating artist. The forgeries of Farquhar's plays are the first examples to come to light of engravings as part of the handicraft of the pirate under consideration; neither the Shakespeare plays nor The Lying Lover had frontispieces. The piracies of the two 1733 editions of Farquhar closely resemble the legitimate editions in the frontispiece engravings and every carved ornament; there can be no question that an artist, and a skillful one at that, was hired specifically to counterfeit the engravings and ornaments so that they would defy detection. Differences in the legitimate and counterfeit engravings become apparent under minute examination: In the engraved frontispiece of the pirated Beaux' Stratagem , there are no buttons on the skirt of Aimwell's coat; the buttonholes on Archer's pocket are missing; the furbelows on the dress at the left are wider than those of the original; the capitals on the doorway are taller and somewhat more elaborate; the chandelier is slightly broader. In The Recruiting Officer , the difference can be most easily recognized by the fact that the man at the extreme left in the piracy has only four buttons instead of the seven of the original; there are of course again many differences in detail that can be detected by examining the fake and the real together, but the two must be compared to see the differences. Actually copying engravings was not a particularly rare procedure in the 1730's. Both Feales and another bookseller, probably Robert Walker, issued editions of Steele's The Conscious Lovers , for example, with two different imitations of the Van der Gucht engraving in Tonson's edition of 1733. Feales's copy, which was reversed from the original (the easiest way to copy an engraving), appeared in an edition he issued in 1735, a year before the copyright expired. Feales's name had appeared in the imprint of Tonson's 1733 edition, and the new edition bore his own imprint, 'Printed for W. Feales . . . and the Book-sellers of London and Westminster.' The 1740 edition, 'Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country' after copyright expiration, and found in Walker's The Best English Plays , contains a second imitation, this one not reversed. But neither copy pretended to be Tonson's 1733 edition. Oddly enough, in the frontispieces in both Farquhar plays, the "forger" was an artist perhaps superior to the man he imitated. Although his lines tend to be heavily drawn and his faces less delicate than those by his predecessor, he shows a finer hand at detail, usually better skill at shading, and greater talent at depicting wigs and clothes. Sometimes he added detail rather than slavishly imitating the original. My point is, of course, that he was a man of considerable talent, many shades above the craftsmen who usually took on the work of shabbily counterfeited engravings like those of The Conscious Lovers . The engravings in the two Farquhar plays, taken along with the headpieces and ornamental bands, were obviously aimed at duplicity far more secretive than that shown by Feales and Walker with The Conscious Lovers . Although it is even more difficult to describe the differences in ornaments than to spot them, the following list will point out some ways to distinguish the two editions of The Beaux' Stratagem : Page and ornament Legitimate edition Piracy A2 v Ornamental band To fill out lines composed of standard fleurons, one semicolon is used in each band. Exclamation points used to fill out lines; one upright, one inverted in upper band; both inverted in lower band. P. 3 Headpiece Horizontal line and dot on ball in middle of ornament. Vertical lines on ball. P. 5 Headpiece Three faint bricks on bottom row of wall; leaves at top right point left; four indentations on battlement; two lines on tower to represent windows in facade. Four bricks. Leaves point down. Three. Three lines. P. 49 Ornamental band Exclamation point to fill out line of fleurons. Only fleurons. P. 68 Headband Two star ornaments, seven fleurons. Two small fleurons with seven other fleurons. P. 90 Headband Composed of standard floral ornaments. In middle one piece of a different ornament used. Only floral ornaments used. The title-page also is a close copy of the original, varying noticeably only in the use of a swash D in ' DRURY ' and in the rules at the bottom of the page. The text of the play is not so closely copied, however, as are the ornaments and other more conspicuous details. Although the piracy is a page-by-page reprint, there are substantive variants such as 'Face' for 'his Face' (19.11), 'naughty' for 'naught' (20.2), 'a Reparation' for 'Reparation' (20.3.), 'must' for 'most' (43.38), 'first' for 'fifth' (45.40), 'us' for 'me' (69.35). The most surprising of the substantive variants is the catchword on p. 11, ' Aim. ' incorrectly replacing ' Arch. '; the printer was so unusually careful in noticeable details that his failure to correct the variant in catchword position is curious. There are also numerous variants in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, 'Old' for 'old' (Dramatis Personae), for example, 'good nature' for 'Good-nature' (14.34), 'Dear?' for 'Dear;' (16.11), 'you' for the incorrect 'your' (16.21), 'tho' for 'though' (46.18), etc. And there are of course the many points at which the piracy does not follow the copy line for line, for example on pp. 10.28-29; 11.30-35; 14.27-28; and 64. 6-15. 3 No press figures were used in either edition, but the running-titles and catchwords of the piracy, with the one exception of p. 11, are meticulous imitations of those of the original. Signatures are not precisely placed to match the legitimate edition of 1733, but seven of the eighteen seem calculatedly close to the original. The very fact that there was more concern for counterfeiting engraving, title-page, ornaments, and running-titles, and for approximating placement on the page than there was for the accuracy of the text indicates that the printer's primary goal was to avoid discovery when he marketed his copies. The ornaments in The Recruiting Officer are more closely imitated than in The Beaux' Stratagem , but they can be distinguished by comparing the original and imitation. For example, on A6, an odd ornament is inserted in a line of fleurons in the original but not in the imitation. On the titlepage, the counterfeit edition includes a Y shaded backwards in the word 'COMEDY'; a swash D in ' DRURY '; and no period after Æneid'. Again the running-titles, signatures, and catchwords resemble the original with few exceptions; the signature on p. 29 incorrectly reads B2 instead of B3 as in the original; the catchword 'a' on p. 43 is missing in the piracy; and the catchword on p. 75 reads ' Bal. ' instead of ' Ball. ' as an abbreviation for Justice Ballance. There is, as in The Beaux' Stratagem , less precision in placement of signatures than Dawson found in the Shakespeare piracies. Characteristically, less concern is shown for composition than for the more obvious elements of the page. Forty pages contain differences in lineation. There are again numerous substantive changes, usually careless misprints: 'acquaint' for 'acquit' (A3 v l. 16), ' Shropshire ' for ' Shrewsbury ' (13.29), 'Force' for 'Forces' (17.17), 'Letter says' for 'Letters say' (29.36), 'liberty' for 'your liberty' (35.38), etc. The printer's attitude toward accidentals is also casual; on a single page, p. 21, for example, one finds 'Psha?' for 'Psha!' (l. 10), ' Welch ' for ' Welsh ' (l. 19), the substantive omission 'far' for 'far as' (l. 24) and 'Complexion' for 'Complection' (ll. 26-27). The pirate consistently spells 'Battle' instead of 'Battel'. He does not hesitate to change spelling or punctuation. His concern is, once again, for what shows. The pirate-printer was even able to practice certain economies. The same headband had been used in Lintot's editions of The Lying Lover , 1732, on A2; The Recruiting Officer , 1733, p. 95; and The Beaux' Stratagem , 1733, p. 89. A single counterfeit ornament appears in the piracies of The Recruiting Officer and The Beaux' Stratagem , and although I have not seen Mr. Foxon's Lying Lover , I would not be surprised to find it there. Again, another ornamental headband appeared in the originals on A4 and p. 54 of The Lying Lover and p. 3 of The Beaux' Stratagem , and the pirate doubtless saved work by reusing his imitation of it too. While no one could quarrel with the efficiency of the pirate—his ruse, after all, worked, and he remained undiscovered for more than two hundred years—almost anyone could marvel at his motivation. With The Recruiting Officer , first published in April 1706, and The Beaux' Stratagem , first published in April 1707, as with the piracies described by Dawson and Foxon, the copyright had expired 10 April 1731 according to the Copyright Law of 1710. Dawson conjectured that the Shakespeare piracies occurred after 1731; Foxon knew The Lying Lover could be no earlier than 1733. With the Farquhar plays, obviously the piracy can not predate 1733, since that is the date of the editions which were imitated. Therefore copyright was not a legal issue. It is true that the owners of old copyrights managed by bluffing, largely through temporary injunctions and the threat of costly legal suits, to keep younger and less well-heeled booksellers away from lucrative copyrights such as Shakespeare. 4 But if The Beaux' Stratagem and The Recruiting Officer could fall into the category of copyrights worth fighting over, it is scarcely believable that The Lying Lover , a dismal failure on stage that folded after six nights and never played again until a last run of four nights in 1746, 5 could be worthy of dispute. The most logical explanation is the one that both Dawson and Foxon suggested: copies were surreptitiously printed in order to fill out collections of plays when the old runs of single plays had been exhausted. Dawson and Foxon concluded that the culprit might well be William Feales: the copies they found were bound in The English Theatre , the collection which Feales pieced together by buying up old copies of plays and later supplemented with new copies when the old ones ran out. Furthermore, none of the piracies that they found bore Feales's imprint. The Shakespearean piracies were sold by various booksellers, A. Bettesworth and F. Clay; Mary Paulson, Bettesworth, R. Caldwell, and Clay; and Tonson, J. Darby, Bettesworth, and Clay. The Lying Lover was printed for Lintot. Foxon conjectured that perhaps Feales pirated it rather than Steele's other plays because the other three were published by Tonson, with whom Feales was on good terms, "but perhaps difficulties arose with Lintot." The pirated Beaux' Stratagem , however, cancels the probability of such an explanation, for the "good" 1733 edition bore the names of Lintot and Feales together on the imprint. Obviously there would be little point in Feales's counterfeiting his own legitimate edition. Even the possibility that Feales could have reprinted the 1733 edition to fill out volumes of The English Theatre after a quarrel with Lintot must be rejected, for the next edition, in 1736, once again cites both names in the imprint. Furthermore, whereas the first four piracies to be discovered appeared in copies of The English Theatre , the two Folger copies of The English Theatre contain copies of the legitimate 1730 and 1733 editions of The Beaux' Stratagem and The Recruiting Officer ; the Folger copy of the pirated Beaux' Stratagem is bound in a two-volume nonce collection under a binder's title "Select Comedies" and "Select Tragedies", which includes plays dated 1724 to 1747 printed variously for Tonson, Lintot, Knapton, Longman, Draper, Watts, and others. Undeniably the piracy could have appeared in The English Theatre , but in the case of Farquhar we have no evidence that it did. 6 Feales typically bought remainder stocks of plays and reissued them in collections with his title-pages. By 1733 he had a thriving business with Tonson, issuing new editions of Shakespeare with his name in the imprint, and he also published in conjunction with Lintot, John Clarke, J. Watts, J. Woodward, the Wellingtons, Bettesworth, Clay, and other booksellers. Robert Walker, in his attempt to free Shakespeare from Tonson's tight grip in 1734, denounced Feales as a member of the greedy establishment who were trying to retain illegal rights to print best sellers such as Shakespeare. 7 Feales was in very good odor indeed at the probable time of the piracies, and apparently he was embarked on most lucrative publishing ventures. For him surreptitiously to counterfeit his own legitimate stock simply does not make sense, even if he needed to replenish a diminishing stock. He could have openly had The Beaux' Stratagem reissued as he did The Conscious Lovers in 1735. There could be no sane business reason to engage in piracy. It would seem that he bought these copies of Shakespeare and Steele in good faith. Who, then, was the pirate? Unless the forged headpieces can be traced, it will be hard indeed to indict anyone, but as Professor James G. McManaway pointed out to me, if the pirate was really concerned about detection, he would have abandoned the headpieces after using them. The pieces that were imitated can be linked with books printed for Lintot. The initial C on p. 5 of The Beaux' Stratagem belongs to a set of initials, identifiably similar, used by Lintot's printer in various plays. The headpiece on p. 5 was used on A3 of the fourth edition of The Works of Mr. Edmund Smith , published by Lintot in 1729; the one on p. 89 appears on A5 v and the one on p. 3 on A6 of Baker's Tunbridge Walks , printed for Lintot and sold by Feales, 1733; and the one on p. 89 reappears on p. 95 of the 1733 Recruiting Officer . In each case, it is the legitimate ornament rather than the copy that appears. But I have not discovered the counterfeits in any texts that postdate the piracies, and obviously they would not have appeared earlier since they were made in order to resemble the ornaments in the 1733 editions. Nor have I found elsewhere the ones used in the Shakespeare or The Lying Lover . Robert Walker comes to mind as a possible suspect. He locked horns with Tonson and Feales on printing Shakespeare in 1734-35. 8 Walker was publishing under his own imprint by 1729, 9 but nothing is known of his activities between then and 1734; at any rate, he was certainly on the scene at an appropriate time to counterfeit the 1733 editions. However, the meticulous care and secretiveness of the pirate is completely uncharacteristic of Walker's blatancy and his crude printing. Walker openly defied Tonson's phony claim of copyright in 1734-35. Furthermore his printing skill was not notable, and he used and reused a very meagre store of carved ornaments in the Shakespeare and The Beauties of the English Stage of 1740, none of which are those of the piracies. Surprisingly, however, when Walker printed an edition of The Recruiting Officer in 1739, he used as copy not the legitimate edition of 1733 or 1736, but the forgery. Consistently his text agrees with that of the pirate on substantives as well as accidentals. The only exceptions are those points at which the pirate is obviously wrong; for example, 'acquit' once again replaces 'acquaint' in a reference to acquitting a manager of a charge (A3 v l. 16), and the misspelling 'whithin' (38.31 of the piracy) returns to 'within'. With the exception of that kind of error and, rarely, a non-significant change ('myself' in the original [30.10], 'my self' in the piracy, 'myself' in Walker), Walker very closely follows the piracy in every case in which it differs from the original. The use of the piracy as copy could be a mere coincidence, but at least it suggests the possibility that in his early days Walker was far more careful and discreet about printing plays than he was to be with Shakespeare and The Beauties of the English Stage . But if Walker is suspicious, he is certainly not indictable. And so for now, the pirate retains his well-deserved anonymity. His skill was consummate. Surely in the future, magnifying glasses in hand, we will find that his range was wider than the odd assemblage of six plays that we have thus far discovered. And perhaps, with sufficient diligence and good luck, we will even unmask him. Even if his face remains unknown, however, his hand will probably be increasingly visible.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Samuel Ruchardson and Defoe's Tour (1738): The Evidence of Bibliography by Pat Rogers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among unsolved questions of attribution comes the responsibility for later editions of Daniel Defoe's Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain . It has long been known that Samuel Richardson was connected with the third, fourth and fifth editions (1742, 1748, 1753). It is likely that this was also the case with the sixth edition (dated 1762-61), though this did not appear until November 1761, four months after Richardson's death. The major uncertainty, however, concerns the second edition of October 1738. Downs and Dottin thought that Richardson was involved in the revisions here too. William M. Sale, jr., relying on statements in the 1742 preface, concluded that Richardson did not take over as editor until the third edition. 1 Recently, in the standard biography, T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel have revived the earlier claim. They write, 'It seems to us almost certain that Richardson's connection with the Tour began in 1738.' This statement is based on consideration of the revisions and editorial interpolations in the text of that year. 2 A small bibliographic anomaly permits us to add further corroborative evidence. We know that Richardson's firm printed Volumes I and II of the second edition; 3 and it is an error in this area—more specifically binding—which supplies the clue. All copies of the work I have examined 4 contain the same oddity in the entry for Eton College, at the end of the first letter in Volume II. The cause of the confusion is easily located. And although the exact sequence of events can only be conjectured, a strong circumstantial case builds up pointing at Richardson's involvement. When the second volume of the Tour originally came out in 1725, Defoe had referred briefly to repairs carried out on the college buildings. He also named the then Provost, Henry Godolphin. 5 In 1738 the editor added a mention of a new library, and continued: In the great Court a fine Statue is also erected to the Honour of Dr. Godolphin , Dean of St. Paul 's, and Provost of this College, who was a Benefactor to it. This occurs on p. 71, the recto of the last leaf in gathering D (D12). However, all copies then follow with another leaf (E1) paginated 71-72, and signed E. Thereafter the register proceeds in the normal fashion. The new leaf has the first paragraph of the recto, just cited, amended thus: In the great Court a fine Statue is also erected to the Honour of the Founder, by Dr. Godolphin , late Dean of St. Paul 's, and Provost of this College, and the Library has receiv'd several considerable Benefactions of late Years. To make room for this change, the second paragraph from the foot of the page is reset to fit two, instead of three, lines. Otherwise the page is identical (apart from the addition of 'Vol. II E' prior to the catchword), and the verso is wholly undisturbed. 6 In fact the bulk of the type was left standing. The reason for making the textual change is easy to find. In its original form, the paragraph described the statue as that of Godolphin, rather than of Henry VI. But it is here that the oddity appears. Instead of simply cancelling the erroneous leaf, the book presents a mosaic of both versions. In turn we have pp. 71-72 in uncorrected form, making the ordinary D12; then the same pages, making E1, and starting off a perfectly ordinary gathering. The second letter of this volume begins on E2 r , p. 73. It is obvious that the presence of both cancelland and cancel leaves arose from a technical slip-up: perhaps, faulty instructions to the binder. However, it is also apparent that the mistake was noted too late for correction for press but before the imposition of the first forme of sheet E. Whilst the type of signature D was still undistributed, the change was made in time to reimpose the standing type of D12 recto (corrected) and verso (unaltered) in the two formes of sheet E. The rest of the book went on unaffected. This was undoubtedly a printing-house alteration, concerned with an error missed at proof stage. It is incidentally the kind of adjustment made throughout, though normally it is Defoe's text which is being revamped, and the aim is updating rather than correction of a mistake. 7 Significantly, there was someone directly involved in the printing of the book who could authorise and compile a new paragraph of this sort. The reworking of the entire sentence forbids the possibility that a compositor simply missed out a few words from his copy. The passage has indeed been rewritten , and this occurred (as we have seen) on the spot during the printing of the sheets. Only one other name has ever been tentatively associated with revisions of the Tour , and this on dubious evidence. A manuscript note in the British Museum copy of the 1742 edition states that supplementary material was furnished (for this occasion?) 'by Mess r . Richardson, Kimber, &amp; others.' 8 Whatever the plausibility of Isaac Kimber on general grounds, he would be an unlikely man to find in a printing-house. That he, or anyone else apart from Richardson, could have been in a position to find the error so quickly, and correct it so confidently in the midst of printing, is surely highly improbable. The 'reviser' here was practically certain to be Samuel Richardson. And this strengthens the already powerful case of Eaves and Kimpel, dating Richardson's share in the enterprise back to 1738.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Case for Fielding's Authorship of An Address to the Electors of Great Britain (1740) Reopened by Thomas R. Cleary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though it has been repeatedly suggested that a lengthy political tract, An Address to the Electors of Great Britain , was written by Henry Fielding, the attribution has not gained general acceptance. In the 1920's Frederick S. Dickson and Gerard E. Jensen pondered this possibility, and, more recently, A. Leroy Greason Jr. expanded their hesitant suggestions into a full-scale argument in favor of Fielding's authorship. Though Greason's argument seemed reasonably strong, it was seriously questioned by William B. Coley, and Fielding's claim has not been advanced again. Not all of Coley's objections are cogent or material, however, and this paper will show that there is sufficient external and stylistic evidence to justify a reasonably firm attribution of the Address to Fielding. The evidence for this attribution has emerged gradually. The original suggestion was made by Frederick S. Dickson in a note (dated March 19, 1923) on the fly-leaf of a copy of the pamphlet he donated to the Yale University library. 1 Dickson erroneously suggests that the pamphlet is a reprint of one published in London in August, 1739, and offers no real evidence for his attribution, but declares his conviction "that Henry Fielding wrote this paper." Gerard E. Jensen published Dickson's note and cursorily examined the external evidence for and against his conclusion. On the positive side, he observes that word usage and the "almost unvaried use of 'hath', 'doth', 'shew', 'whilst'" tempt the reader to say, "This is Fielding", and that Fielding's name is connected with the pamphlet in an inserted notice on page 56: "The Author is industriously conceal'd, tho' the Daily Gazetteer, in a mad Fit of Anger, ascribes it to Mr. Fielding." As corroboratory evidence, he cites allusions to Lord Coke, Harrington, Cambden, Bracton, Hale, Eachard, Matthew Paris, Locke, Rapin, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Montaigne "and other authorities in Fielding's Library", two uses of the word " Champion ", characteristic satiric references to "great men" and Jonathan Wild, and an attack on Walpole that is "persuasively suggestive of Fielding the political reformer." On the negative side, he wonders whether six references to Algernon Sidney are matched by references in Fielding's authentic works, asks (surprising as it may seem) whether the use of the word "nay" on eight occasions stirs "any remembrance in the lovers of Fielding", and notes that certain spellings are not in accordance with Fielding's orthographic habits. More materially, he finds occasional lapses in style bothersome, citing one terribly inept sentence and questioning whether Fielding was capable of writing it. On balance, however, he concurs with Dickson's attribution mainly because "in general style and usage it is markedly characteristic of our author." 2 Dickson presents no argument and Jensen's discussion is often far from impressive, or even informed, but Greason's revival of Fielding's claim is another matter. He expanded upon Jensen's stylistic argument, stressing that the consistent use of "hath" and "doth", the frequent employment of "nay" and such phrases as "thro' thick and thin", "in a word", "in plain English", "great Men" and "I say" are consistent with Fielding's stylistic habits. He solidifies the argument from content by, among other things, locating an essay ( Champion , May 8, 1740) in which Fielding anticipates an assault in the Address on Walpole's post of Prime Minister as a destructive excrescence on the fabric of the Constitution and another essay ( Champion , December 4, 1739) in which he alludes to Algernon Sidney. Most importantly, he points out that the Address was first published as a lengthy series of essays in the Champion beginning on November 1, 1740. This discovery not only allows him to correct the false impression that the pamphlet is a reprint of one published in 1739, but obviously provides strong circumstantial support for the attribution to Fielding. Other evidences of his authorship take on new authority in the light of the initial appearance of the Address in a journal dominated by Fielding, and Greason concludes that this new evidence all but absolutely confirms Fielding's claim. 3 Despite its obvious strengths, Greason's attribution has not, however, won general acceptance because of objections raised by William B. Coley. 4 Coley does not deny that Fielding may have written the Address , but suggests that Greason's evidence is too ambiguous to justify its acceptance into his canon. He divides Greason's evidence into three categories—external evidence, stylistic evidence, and the evidence of content—and questions the strength of each in turn. Such a procedure does less than justice to a case that depends on mutually corroborative points, but a rebuttal of Coley's objections must perforce follow it, considering the cogency of his objections category by category. To give Coley his due, one can only support his rejection of Greason's argument from content. Of all approaches to the problem of attributing anonymous works, the tracing of parallels in thought is the most dubious unless the ideas in question and the allusions or metaphors are strikingly individual or undeniable verbal parallels extensively support the impression that the same mind is at work. In the case of the Address , no one familiar with the literature produced by the opposition to Walpole in the decade preceding its publication can doubt that Coley is correct in describing its "reasoning" and "many of [its] allusions" as "stock anti-ministerial journalism" and in maintaining that, on the grounds of content alone , Fielding's claim to its authorship is neither stronger, nor weaker than James Ralph's. 5 The Address is a most impressive work, matching, at its best, the pamphlets of Carteret, Pulteney, and Lyttleton in its perspicacity and rhetorical energy, but its arguments are wholly derivative. Once accepted as authentic, its length and its serious and (by the journalistic standards of the day) temperate and scholarly examination of the potential dangers to the Constitution of Walpole's assumption of the unconstitutional role of Prime Minister 6 and use of the funds and patronage placed at his disposal to insure his continued control of the House of Commons 7 would make it an addition to Fielding's canon of great interest and importance. It would have to be regarded as the most important early statement of his political principles, one standing out from and illuminating the occasional, witty, ironical, ad hoc satire that was his specialty as an opposition author; it would provide the first glimpse of the side of his genius manifested in the moral and social cum political tracts produced after his elevation to the magistracy. But its familiar arguments and predictable allusions can provide no reliable evidence for or against its attribution to Fielding. Fortunately, the external and stylistic evidence for such an attribution endures Coley's scrutiny far better. Here again, certain of his objections are valid, but other crucial ones are not sufficiently relevant or convincing to justify disregarding the compelling nexus of mutually corroboratory external and stylistic evidences of Fielding's authorship of the Address . Greason's facts can be more effectively marshalled behind his attribution than they are in his discussion (which is as concerned with fixing the original publication date of the Address as defending the attribution), and certain items of evidence not previously applied to the problem considerably strengthen Fielding's claim. Coley begins his critique of the external evidence by very correctly censuring as optimistic Greason's conclusion that "the only objection to the initial appearance of the pamphlet in the Champion as proof that Fielding was the author is the absence of Fielding's signature, a 'C' or an 'L'." This single item of external evidence undeniably does not "constitute conclusive grounds" for the assignment, though "it reinforces the claim that the Champion group was in some way connected with the publication of this pamphlet" (p. 488). The problem, as Coley accurately diagnoses it, is to prove that Fielding and not another regular or occasional contributor to the Champion was its author, and he finds the available external evidence unacceptably vague. He notes that the only concrete external indication cited by Jensen and Greason is the ambiguous notice inserted in the Edinburgh pamphlet: " The Author is industriously conceal'd, tho' the Daily Gazetteer, in a mad Fit of Anger, ascribes it to Mr. Fielding." Coley does not question that this ironical notice is intended to suggest that Fielding wrote the Address , for he correctly describes it as an "obvious Puff" (i.e., an attempt to attract readers by hinting that it is indeed the work of the well-known London journalist). He also rounds out Greason's evidence by citing the original attribution, made by Ralph Courteville under his pen-name, "Freeman", in the Daily Gazetteer for November 14, 1740: It is now, as I remember, some Weeks ago, since that Credit to the Cause, the Champion , of the Patriots, threatened us with a Series of Papers on the Elections, written by a distinguish'd Hand, and Care was taken to prepossess the Town that this distinguish'd Person was a Man of great Parts, and also of great Quality. In consequence of this he made the Publick dance a long Attendance! now these Letters were to be inserted this Time, now that; nay, a Sort of Running Footman, an Occasional Scribbler, was dispatch'd before him to stop People's Mouths with a few crude Sentences on the same Subject, till this distinguish'd Hand was at leisure. All in the true Bear-Garden Stile, where 'tis notoriously known that the Scum of the Theatre break Heads before the Masters mount. Well, at length comes the Great Man, and who should it be but—Captain Vinegar himself—what Anger? What Disappointment in the Audience? This specific ascription by a knowledgeable adversary would seem to considerably strengthen Greason's case; Coley admits that it seems "at first glance . . . a circumstantial and unequivocal account of the appearance of the Address " (p. 489). Nonetheless, he insists that it be regarded as suspect, offering, though his arguments are not always clear, three justifications for his dubiety (pp. 489-490). He never questions that Courteville means to attribute the Address specifically to Fielding, but attempts repeatedly to depict his testimony as untrustworthy. He first terms Courteville's statement "a typically partisan utterance of the paper war of politics." This is obviously true (the statement is vitriolic and Courteville had long been an enemy), but Coley does not explain further and his remark hardly seems a cogent argument against accepting the ascription. Coley may mean that Courteville is lying, but, if he does, his failure to say so clearly underlines the total lack of concrete evidence to support such an accusation and the extreme unlikelihood that so clever a political infighter would risk so "circumstantial and unequivocal" a lie. Though Coley's second point is more specific, it seems irrelevant to the question of Fielding's authorship of the Address . He identifies the "few crude sentences on the same subject" that Courteville says were written by an "Occasional Scribbler" as a letter "To the Freeholders and Electors of Great Britain", signed "Philopatriae", that appeared in the Champion for September 20 and 23, 1740. He notes that while one contemporary source, an Edinburgh journal called the Patriot , agrees with Courteville in ascribing these essays and the Address to different authors, the former are attributed to "Vinegar" in the Political Calendar for September, 1740. This discrepancy regarding the authorship of the "Philopatriae" essays appears to Coley, "together with the tone of the entire 'Freeman' account," to cast doubt on the validity of Courteville's ascription of the Address . It is difficult, however, to fathom how it does so. Coley admits that the Political Calendar may be using "Vinegar" as a synecdoche for the Champion , rather than specifically attributing the essays to Fielding. If true, this eliminates the discrepancy Coley stresses. Moreover, even if one assumes that an attribution to Fielding was intended, it is best regarded as simple error. Coley does not suggest that the style of the earlier essays provides the slightest excuse for ascribing them to Fielding and the Political Calendar is a notoriously inaccurate and hurriedly prepared medley, though its convenient summary of events, month by month, has made it a popular short-cut for modern scholars. In short, Coley's argument serves, at most, as an implicit warning that all contemporary sources are not equally trustworthy and that ascriptions to "Vinegar" may be ambiguous, and while such a warning might, in other circumstances, be useful, the fact of the "two conflicting ascriptions" of the "Philopatriae" essays seems purely a "red herring" with reference to the question of the validity of Courteville's ascription. Coley's third and final point is that the date of the statement in the Gazetteer (November 14) shows that it was not made in the light of the signature that may or may not have been appended to the final essay in the original series and, thus, corroborates the Edinburgh edition's claim that "the Author is industriously conceal'd." (The last of the seven extant installments was published on November 15, but Greason conjectures that the series ran through the issue for November 29.) This is true, but it again seems doubtfully relevant or material. It seems unlikely that Courteville would have needed the evidence of a signature to determine the authorship of the series; such a secret would in all likelihood have been penetrable by so canny and experienced a denizen of the small, not notably honourable, world of London journalism. It seems even more unlikely that the original series was signed at all, and almost inconceivable that it bore a signature that would have identified Fielding (or, indeed, any regular contributor to the Champion ) as its author. The lack of a signature in the Edinburgh reprint, which is remarkably faithful as far as the extant original issues allow comparison, 8 strongly suggests that none was appended to the final issue. Moreover, a series of advertisements for the Address published during September and November, 1740, suggests that Courteville investigated the pre-publication history of the Address with some care before making his attribution and lends credence to his claim that the Champion was trying to pass off a series by "Captain Vinegar" as the work of an outside contributor. If such an imposture was being attempted, a signature intended to clarify rather than obscure the true authorship of the series would have been unthinkable, and the close adherence of Courteville's account to the other circumstances surrounding its publication lends authority to his identification of its author. Coley speaks of the impression of "circumstantiality and unequivocality" made by Courteville's account, but seems unaware of the precision with which it fits certain facts. Except for a slight understatement of the length of the delay, Courteville is precisely accurate in his recollection that "some Weeks ago . . . the Champion . . . threatened us with a Series of Papers on the Elections, written by a distinguish'd Hand, and Care was taken to prepossess the Town that this distinguish'd Person was a Man of great Parts, and also of great Quality." The Address was first advertised, thus, on September 6, 9 and 11: N.B. We shall shortly present our Readers with some Papers addressed to the Electors of Great Britain , written by a very Eminent Hand, who hath thought fit to honour us by the introducing them into the World thro' our Hands. Equally accurate is Courteville's complaint that the public was then made to "dance a long Attendance; now these Letters were to be inserted this time, now that; nay, a Sort of Running Footman, an Occasional Scribbler, was despatch'd before him to stop People's Mouths with a few crude Sentences on the same Subject, till this distinguish'd Hand was at leisure." On September 20 and 23, the "crude Sentences" (the "Philopatriae" essays) appeared, and almost simultaneously (September 23 and 25) a delay was announced: "Our Readers are desired to take Notice, that the Papers, relating to the Elections, lately promised in the Champion, will be published in the Beginning of next Month." And this promise too was premature, for October came and passed without a mention of the papers until it was accurately announced on October 30 that "On Saturday next we shall begin to publish the promis'd Address to the Electors of Great Britain ." An attempt in the opening sentence of the first issue (November 1) to brazen out an embarrassing situation ("This Address, tho' long since propos'd, comes earlier to you, than my first intention . . .") only underscores the obvious fact that something had gone wrong with the original plan for the series. Courteville certainly wrote his satiric ascriptions with the advertisements in mind or in hand. The series of delays, together with the surprising and almost certainly significant avoidance of any mention of the "Eminent Hand" after the first boasting advertisement, might well have confirmed his suspicion that the style of the first six installments suggested Fielding's hand. The advertisements form a pattern strongly suggesting that the series was initially promised by an outside contributor (presumably an important opposition figure), who repeatedly delayed and finally reneged, forcing a member of the Champion 's regular staff to write the series in diplomatic silence in the vain hope that the embarrassing substitution would not be noticed. 9 The external evidence is, then, not seriously shaken by Coley's objections, each of which misses the mark. It is, indeed, far stronger than Greason's discussion makes it seem, for he failed to locate the original ascription in the Gazetteer and every indication that Courteville's ascription was a considered one renders his testimony more compelling. The external evidence alone—its original appearance in the Champion , Courteville's "circumstantial and unequivocal" attribution, together with the evidence of the advertisements, and the "Puff" in the Edinburgh pamphlet—might be viewed as a strong, if finally not quite sufficient, basis for assigning the Address to Fielding. But, fortunately, its style provides the final corroboration that Fielding, and not another staff member, was the substitute forced to fill in for the mysterious "Eminent Hand". Jensen and Greason, as noted, regard the frequent and consistent use of "hath" and the less frequent, but equally consistent use of "doth", rather than "has" and "does", as very strong indications of Fielding's hand. This old-fashioned preference was, as Coley notes, recognized as a consistent peculiarity of his style during his own lifetime and has been considered an important "test" of his authorship of anonymous works since the publication in 1858 of Thomas Keightley's essay "On the Life and Writings of Henry Fielding". 10 Nonetheless, Coley strikes at the heart of the stylistic argument by questioning whether the Address 's passage of this "test" is a reliable basis for an attribution. His argument has definite merits. Modern scholars place limited confidence in this traditional method of determining Fielding's authorship since Fielding was not the only writer of his day to prefer the obsolescent usages, and, in this instance, Coley points out that certain later works by James Ralph, Fielding's assistant on the Champion , exhibit the "hath" usage (pp. 490-491). But though indiscriminate dependence on the "hath" test can lead to error (a case in point being the attribution by some of the almost surely spurious The Crisis: A Sermon to Fielding 11 ) and Ralph's occasional use of "hath" is disturbing, Coley's dismissal of the stylistic argument as inconclusive seems unjustified. Ralph never uses "doth" as far as I can determine and does not use "hath" in Champion essays or indeed anywhere else until after 1740. Coley suggests that his eschewing of "hath" in the Champion "may have been part of a deliberate separation of styles, designed to create the impression that there were several distinct contributors to the journal" (p. 490), but ignores the obvious unlikelihood that Ralph would have used "hath" (for the first time in a year of writing Champion essays) and "doth" (for the first and only time in his career) in a series of essays being passed off as the work of an outside contributor. More importantly, Coley's rejection of this stylistic indicator appears justified only because he considers it in isolation from the external evidence. Logic requires that heavy stress be laid on this usage in literally dozens of instances in a work originally published in the Champion and ascribed to Fielding by as informed and intelligent a contemporary as Ralph Courteville. Coley's strictures are not confined to the usage "test". He very reasonably rejects as evidence the "verbal mannerisms" stressed by Greason ("thro' thick and thin", "in a word", "in plain English", "great Men", and "I say") since they are used in Champion essays not by Fielding. More importantly, but less convincingly, Coley also suggests that a "certain thickening of style" in the Address , a heavy dependence on "parallelisms, repetitions, and series [constructions]" and "the aggregative use of colons to lengthen sentences" are more typical of Ralph's style than Fielding's and conjectures that this "may have been in back of Jensen's candid admission that there was much in the pamphlet that did not have the ring of true Fielding about it" (p. 491). His judgment does not, however, stand close scrutiny. Jensen does not express the broad misgivings Coley attributes to him. He merely questions whether one horrendous sentence on p. 93 of the Address could have been written by Fielding. It is as difficult to imagine either James Ralph or Fielding writing such a sentence under normal circumstances as it is easy to imagine either writer doing so under the conditions that must have prevailed. No other sentence in the lengthy pamphlet equals it in ineptitude, and the very few sentences resembling it in the pamphlet all occur in its closing section, where the fatigue resulting from the need to produce three closely-reasoned, scholarly essays a week might well have betrayed Fielding into occasional clumsiness, particularly since (as external evidence indicates) the Address was hurriedly huddled together when the "Eminent Hand" of the advertisements failed to fulfill his promise. Coley's contention about the "certain thickening of style" combines a questionable subjective impression with certain objective, but inconclusive evidence. Its central basis is his impression that the style of the Address is generally more reminiscent of Ralph's Champion essays than Fielding's. But there seems to be no general stylistic pattern in the Address that renders Fielding's authorship less plausible. Though it may not quite reproduce the easy, droll flow of his best comic and satiric contributions to the Champion , its prose recalls that of his "serious" political essays in the later runs of the True Patriot and the Jacobite's Journal , as well as of the formal moral and social essays in the Miscellanies of 1743. The differences between Fielding's normal Champion style and the style of the Address are slight and readily explicable as the result of different aims and subject matter, rather than different authorship. The specific characteristics that Coley cites as more typical of Ralph's style add little solidity to his general impression. First, though the "aggregative use of colons to lengthen sentences" is somewhat more frequent in Ralph's prose, Fielding elsewhere employs this technique with fair frequency and my examination of the Address has not revealed a high enough incidence of sentences so elongated to prove anything. Second, Fielding employs "parallelisms, repetitions, and series [constructions]" with great frequency (as often as they are used in the Address ) in his earlier Champion essays and indeed throughout all of his prose writings. Ralph may use them slightly more often (though my comparison of their Champion essays and other work has not definitely revealed such a pattern), but no striking divergence of the kind that would lend cogency to Coley's argument is apparent. In fact, the most impressive analysis of the structure of Fielding's prose 12 (one not available to Coley), specifically and accurately stresses the extreme importance in the formal essays in the Miscellanies (which are more comparable in length and tone to the Address than Fielding's Champion essays) of parallel and series constructions, repetition, suspensive constructions (which are numerous in the Address ) and a variety of sentence-elongating devices. Coley's stylistic argument is based on a relatively imprecise conception of the structure of Fielding's prose, and seems most dubious in the light of a clearer understanding of its characteristics. The combined external and internal evidence supporting the attribution of the Address to the Electors to Fielding is far stronger and the objections to such an attribution far weaker than has been thought. Gerard E. Jensen prefaces his attribution of the Address to the Electors of Great Britain to Fielding with the humble observation, "Very likely I am too easily persuaded." Perhaps he was premature in judging on the basis of very incomplete evidence and erroneous assumptions. But much has since been learned, and, at a time when the Wesleyan-Oxford edition of Fielding's complete works is in the process of eliminating so many of the bibliographical puzzles that have deviled Fielding studies, it is to be hoped that the merits of his claim to the Address will finally assure its inclusion among his authentic works.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The title-page of the 108 page pamphlet provides the following publication data: "Edinburgh, Printed by Drummond and Company, in Swan 's Close, a little below the Cross-well, North Side of the Street, 1740." Dickson erroneously suggests, "This Address was published in London by Drummond and Company in August 1739," and Jensen accepts his suggestion. 2 Gerard E. Jensen, " An Address to the Electors of Great Britain . . . Possibly a Fielding Tract," Modern Language Notes , 40 (1925), 57-58. 3 A. Leroy Greason Jr., "Fielding's An Address to the Electors of Great Britain ," Philological Quarterly , 33 (1954), 347-352. Greason's argument that the Address first appeared in the Champion in November 1740 is impeccable; equally convincing is his suggestion that Dickson confused the Address with a shorter pamphlet by "H. Goreham: London, 1739" and entitled An Address to the Electors and other free subjects of Great Britain . His discovery of its initial publication in the Champion gives the Address a dual bibliographical significance. No other essays firmly attributable to Fielding published in the Champion after October 21, 1740 are extant, though he may have continued to write for the journal until June, 1741. John B. Shipley has suggested that an essay in the Dublin Evening Post for December 30-January 3, 1739/40 is a reprint of a Fielding essay from the Champion published slightly earlier. But his evidence is too weak to finally support its assignment either to the Champion or to Fielding; "A New Fielding Essay from the Champion ," Philological Quarterly , 42 (1963), 417-422. If the Address is Fielding's, the seven extant essays published between November 1 and November 15 (which correspond to pages 1 to 62 of the pamphlet) are his and the closing section of the Address (pages 63-108) represents, according to Greason's calculations, six more Fielding essays published through November 29, 1740. 4 William B. Coley, "The Authorship of An Address to the Electors of Great Britain (1740)," Philological Quarterly , 36 (1957), 488-495. 5 Coley, pp. 491-495. Though Coley does not attribute the Address to Ralph, he notes, among other things, that Ralph ( Champion , March 18, 1739/40), as well as Fielding, had depicted the post of prime minister as an unconstitutional anomaly and that the one allusion by Fielding to Algernon Sidney cited by Greason is more than overbalanced by evidences of a "sustained and abiding association with the name and works of Sidney" in a number of works by Ralph published between 1741 and 1746; for example, his History of England (1744-46) includes a long and emotional account of Sidney's trial and execution for treason. In support of Coley, it can be added that Algernon Sidney's works provide many of the mottoes heading issues of The Remembrancer , a journal Ralph established in late 1747. 6 Fielding's depiction of the post of prime minister as dangerously unconstitutional is a standard opposition ploy. Analogues of his comparison in the Address (and the Champion for May 8, 1740) of the balanced constitution to the balanced machinery of the Newtonian universe and of the prime minister to an unbalancing "extra part" can be found everywhere in the opposition literature of the period. The Craftsman (cf. Isaac Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle [1968], pp. 20-21, 114-145) returns frequently to this position and it is given formal poetic utterance in J. T. Desangulier's opposition poem "The Newtonian System of the World, the Best Model for Government" (1737). Indeed, in 1740 the House of Lords attempted to unseat Walpole on the grounds that his post was unconstitutional; see William Coxe, Memoirs of the Life and Administration of Sir Robert Walpole (1798), III, 465. 7 Fielding's scholarly arguments in favour of non-partisan independence among electors and legislators and his tracing of the precedents for an independent House of Commons to the Saxon Witenagemot are unique in his works. But many other opposition writers employed the same adaptations of the "Classical Republican" and "Gothick" traditions that had dominated "Whig" political thought since the seventeenth century. These traditions are lucidly discussed in, respectively, Zera Silver Fink, The Classical Republicans , 2nd ed. (1962) and Samuel Kliger, The Goths in England (1952); the dependence upon these traditions of the spokesmen of the anti-Walpole opposition is discussed in Isaac Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle (1968), esp. pp. 114-145. 8 Greason (p. 349, note 4) finds only two very minor discrepancies between the original essays and the first 62 pages of the pamphlet. 9 Greason (pp. 348-349) quotes the first advertisement and notes the existence of the others, but does not apply them to the problem of authorship, no doubt because he had not located Courteville's statement and was primarily concerned at that point in his argument with fixing the original publication date of the Address . Coley does not mention the advertisements. 10 Coley, p. 490, note 9. Fielding's usage is satirized in An Examen of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1750), p. 3. 11 The use of "hath" in The Crisis: A Sermon , a clumsily unimpressive work, seems best explained as an attempt to lend it a specious clerical air. While as careful a scholar as Henry Knight Miller has treated The Crisis as Fielding's ( Essays on Fielding's Miscellanies [1961], pp. 6, 191n), Martin Battestin has questioned its authenticity ("Fielding's Changing Politics and Joseph Andrews ," Philological Quarterly , 39 [1960], 42-43). Neither offers evidence for his view. 12 Henry Knight Miller, Essays on Fielding's Miscellanies (1961), pp. 150-164. Cf.

      <field name="heading_text">The 1785 Variorum Shakespeare by William C. Woodson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Initially during the last quarter of the eighteenth century George Steevens dominated the editing of Shakespeare, but following the publication of his 1778 Variorum he announced his intention never "to appear again as editor of Shakespeare. . . . Ingratitude and impertinence from several of the booksellers have been my reward for conducting two laborious editions, both of which are sold." 1 As his successor he nominated his protege Edmond Malone, whose plans for a new edition were announced in the Gentleman's Magazine of August, 1783. Then simultaneously buttressing his eminence as a Shakespearean and technically keeping his promise to Malone to leave the field open to him, Steevens engaged Isaac Reed to edit anew the 1778 Variorum. Reed worked quickly and produced in 1785 a ten volume Shakespeare, with minimal changes in the commentary and presenting what has been called a "careless reprint" of the 1778 text. 2 To all appearances the 1785 Variorum is of negligible importance in the transmission of the text and generally it is discounted as having little bibliographical importance; both these assumptions, however, need examination. Regarding the text, my experience with Macbeth for the New Variorum shows that Reed introduced new readings from both Steevens and Malone. Moreover, the substantive emendations indicate that Reed did not serve Steevens exclusively or at all times faithfully. The following are the substantive changes from 1778 in Macbeth , here arranged by contributor: 3 Steevens 1. summer-seeding lust 4.3.86 (1912); summer-seeming, Ff, V1778. A new note by Steevens credits Blackstone with the conjecture and implies Steevens' responsibility for the 1785 text: "I have paid the attention to this conjecture which I think it deserves by admitting it into the text." 2. hearing should not latch them 4.3.195 (2037); catch them, Rowe i, V1778. A new note by Steevens accepts the Folio reading. 3. ignorant present 1.5.58 (409); ignorant present time, Pope i, V1778. Steevens' note in 1778 doubting the emendation is reprinted. Malone 1. if trembling I inhibit 3.4.105 (1381); inhabit, Ff, V1778. Whereas Steevens' note doubting the reading of 1778 is reprinted, a new note by Malone strongly argues for "inhibit". 2. Enter Rosse and Angus 1.2.55 (66); Enter Rosse, V1778. Steevens argued against the presence of Angus in 1778 and again in 1785; in his editions of 1793 and 1803 he repeated his argument and removed Angus from the text. Reed, in following Malone's new note and restoring the Folio stage direction, deliberately contradicts Steevens. 3. cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff 5.3.44 (2266); foul bosom, V1778. Steevens' note accepting "foul" appeared in 1778 and Reed printed it in 1785; but at the same time Reed added a new argument by Malone for restoring the Folio reading. Curiously Steevens printed "stuff'd" in 1793 and 1803, although he introduced new arguments against it in the commentary. Reed 1. As when the sun 'gins his reflection 1.2.25 (44); whence, Ff, V1778. In 1778 the catch line from the text that began the commentary note printed "when", an error that was repeated in the catch line of the 1785 commentary. But also in 1785, "when" has crept into the text. This may be of course a compositorial error which escaped Reed in the proofing, and it should be added that the Furness Variorum does not record it as an emendation. Of the eighty accidental variants, ten are primarily errors in putting commas for periods or vice versa; the rest are changes in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, some of which were no doubt suggested by Malone and Steevens, in whose later editions they also appear. If the 1785 Variorum thus has a place in the transmission of the text of Macbeth , the edition also has another order of importance, for it marks a new phase in the history of Shakespeare editions and in the lives of the most prominent editors at the turn of the eighteenth century. That the 1785 Variorum exacerbated the quarrel between Steevens and Malone has been recognized before and attributed to the 1785 notes in which Malone challenged Steevens; indeed it was over difficulties that arose in responding to the notes that Steevens broke off correspondence with Malone. 4 Steevens never bridged the quarrel and undertook his 1793 edition by most accounts to prevent reissue of Malone's 1790 Shakespeare. Yet more importantly the 1793 edition would give Steevens his own forum for responding to Malone and the opportunity to remove from his text the changes suggested by Malone in 1785. The importance of the 1785 Variorum, then, is that it drew Steevens back into editing, and so indirectly helped in perfecting the variorum concept. The edition of 1785 was followed by Malone's of 1790, Steevens' of 1793, 1803, and 1813, and Malone's in 1821, which was used by Furness Sr. in developing his variorum series. 5 Steevens would have delighted to see his dominance as a Shakespearean editor continue into the nineteenth century. As a perusal of Jaggard's Shakespeare Bibliography will show, Steevens' text was frequently reprinted until the reign of Victoria. Because of Steevens' death in 1800, his 1793 Variorum provided the basic text for the 1803 and 1813 editions, as well as for the popular Chalmers' and Boydell pictorial editions. 6 The 1793 text was based on liberal principles of emendation, provocatively set forth in the Advertisement. When Charles Knight complained in his Pictorial edition (1843) against Steevens' editorial high-handedness, his hope to displace Steevens included the realization that Steevens "was received for nearly half a century as the standard text" (VIII, 392). In the chain of events that led to Steevens' remarkable dominance of the commercialization of Shakespeare in the nineteenth century, the 1785 Variorum has a minor but essential place.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">D. H. Lawrence's Progress to Maturity: From Holograph Manuscript to Final Publication of The Prussian Officer and Other Stories by Brian H. Finney</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lawrence reached literary maturity the year he eloped with Frieda (1912) and finally broke from his dead mother's lingering influence. Already twenty-seven years old, he was a late developer. The psychological reasons for this are well documented in Sons and Lovers , the novel he re-wrote in its final form during that first year with Frieda. He was the first to recognise the difference between Sons and Lovers ('a restrained, somewhat impersonal novel') and his previous two novels, The White Peacock ('a florid prose poem') and The Trespasser ('a decorated idyll running to seed in idealism' 1 ). Most critics concur with Lawrence's judgement of these first two novels, but proceed to cite some of his published short stories as early examples of the kind of writing he displayed in novel form in Sons and Lovers . Yet in fact no story written before 1912 shows any more maturity than the two novels of this period. The cause of such widespread misapprehension is a lack of proper research into the genesis of Lawrence's stories. Amazingly, the evidence has mainly survived in the form of holograph manuscripts and corrected typescripts of the early stories. These are scattered all over England and the United States of America, both in the hands of private collectors and in public and university libraries. Collated, the various versions of Lawrence's early short stories provide a fascinating insight into the way he developed from unexceptional beginnings into one of this century's most powerful writers of fiction. Lawrence first began writing short stories in the late autumn of 1907 for a Christmas story competition run by the Nottinghamshire Guardian (he won it with 'A Prelude'). From 1910 onwards his stories began appearing in such periodicals as Ford Madox Ford's English Review , the Nation and the New Statesman . In 1914 Duckworth brought out Lawrence's first collection of short stories, The Prussian Officer and Other Stories . Of the twelve stories included in this book, ten had already appeared in periodicals. With very few exceptions, therefore, there are at least three different versions of each of the stories: a first holograph version, a periodical version and a collected version. Only two of the stories ('The Prussian Officer' and 'The Thorn in the Flesh') were first written after 1912, and even then Lawrence completely re-wrote the latter story for its appearance in book form. Two important points emerge from an examination of all the known versions of the twelve stories published in The Prussian Officer in 1914. Firstly every story in it has been written, re-written, or revised in 1913 or 1914. The revisions Lawrence undertook in July 1913 and July 1914 2 were of a sufficiently drastic nature to warrant dating all the stories in his first collection as the work of 1913-14. Secondly this means that The Prussian Officer collection comprises Lawrence's only fiction between Sons and Lovers , a novel in the nineteenth-century tradition, and his next revolutionary, forward-looking book, The Rainbow . The enormous gulf separating these two quite different novels is bridged by the short stories. The Prussian Officer collection with its periodical and manuscript antecedents, then, provides anyone interested in Lawrence's literary growth with a compelling insight into the stages by which he reached the stature we accord him today. For reasons of space I will confine my attention to three of the stories in The Prussian Officer and Other Stories : 'The White Stocking', 'The Shadow in the Rose Garden' and 'Daughters of the Vicar'. In each case Lawrence's first version of these stories has survived in the form of a holograph manuscript. The early versions are invariably much shorter than the final stories, less than a third the length in the case of 'The Shadow in the Rose Garden', two-fifths in the case of 'The White Stocking'. Conversely, the short early versions often contain far more factual details and events, rely far more heavily on plotting, and tend to cultivate sentimentality in place of genuine emotion. Take Lawrence's first version of 'The White Stocking', for instance. He wrote this in October 1907 for the Christmas story competition being run by the Nottinghamshire Guardian , and entered it in Louie Burrows' name under the category of 'an Amusing Adventure'. 3 The holograph manuscript of this early version (titled: 'The White Stocking: Amusing'), though not listed in Warren Roberts' Soho Bibliography , has survived in the private collection of Mr. W. H. Clarke, Lawrence's younger nephew, who inherited it from his mother, Lawrence's sister, Ada Lawrence Clarke. The story is written in Lawrence's early handwriting on one side of eighteen pages of a ruled exercise book, and runs to approximately 3,500 words. This must be the version that Jessie Chambers described in her memoir as 'an idealised picture of his mother as a young girl going to a ball at the Castle and drawing out a long white stocking in mistake for a pocket handkerchief'. 4 The 1907 story is a naively written account of a Christmas party in Nottingham given by Sam Osborne, a middle-aged, flirtatious employer. His attentions to Prissy, the conceited young heroine, a pattern girl in his company, cause a temporary split between her and her sweetheart, Whiston, the firm's commercial traveller. The two men's rivalry surfaces in an angry exchange when Sam Osborne bumps into Whiston who consequently spills hot coffee down his employer's legs. The climax of the story shows Prissy's downfall as she attempts to prolong her moment of triumph in leading off a dance by drawing out her handkerchief which turns out to be a white stocking to the mirth of everyone. The humiliated Prissy flings the stocking at her mocking employer and rushes out of the room. The banal ending should provide the general savour of this version: Whiston felt his blood boil. He bounded across the room, snatched the stocking from the little man, and flung out of the room. He caught up Prissy running hatless along the foot of the Castle Rock, sobbing breathless. He drew her into a dark shadow, wiped her eyes with the white stocking, and attempted to soothe her. 'Oh George' she sobbed 'oh the beast. Oh I do hate him. I could kill him! And he said things about you and I hated him then. And what shall I do, I've come without my hat?' He comforted her and having fetched a cab, took her home. The characterisation is crudely over-simplified. The hero, Whiston, is wholly virtuous ('as straight as a die, and as good a man as ever walked the streets'), the villain 'Old Beast Osborne', Prissy's 'unlovely employer', is without any saving graces. Prissy's vanity is over-laboured and the whole story is turned into a psychologically unconvincing exemplum of the old adage 'Pride comes before a fall'. The dialogue at times assumes literary pretensions that drive a wide divide between the character and what he or she is made to say. A factory girl greets Whiston's approach with: 'Oh Mr. Whiston, we had been sighing that Sir Lancelot would come to this lonely Astolat' and proceeds to quote Keats at him. Sam Osborne calls Prissy first Salome, then Medusa. Not even for a moment is there a glimpse of the kind of writing that one associates with Lawrence's mature works. In January 1910 Lawrence informed Louie Burrows 'I have re-written the White Stocking'. 5 Then again in April 1911 he wrote to her 'I've finished the fourth story—it's the 'White Stocking' written up'. 6 He sent the 1911 version to Austin Harrison, by then editor of the English Review , who rejected what he called a 'wicked' story early in 1912. 7 The story finally appeared in another magazine, The Smart Set , in October 1914, although an unpublished letter to his agent, Pinker, at the University of Texas at Austin shows that it had been accepted by April 22 of that year. Whether Lawrence had revised the 1911 version yet again in July 1913 must remain in doubt, although its competence suggests this may well have been the case. But the story is now transformed. The 1907 story is told as a flashback. It is flanked each side by events in the present. Whiston is now married to Prissy, re-named Elsie. In the first section we see the two years' married pair on St. Valentine's Day. Elsie receives through the post for the second year running a white stocking with some pearl earrings, obviously from Sam Osborne, now called Sam Adams. Whiston fails to notice the earrings but leaves the house in a temper at her acceptance of the stocking. After the flashback to Sam Adams' Christmas party, the third section recounts the confrontation between husband and wife over her acquiescence to Adams' gallantries, with a final reconciliation. The story ends: Next day she sent back both stockings and earrings. She never told her husband about the latter. 8 In July 1914 Lawrence extensively revised the story for the fourth or fifth time prior to its appearance in The Prussian Officer volume, published in November 1914. 9 The plot is barely altered. The story has been pruned down a little. The incident of the spilt coffee has been dropped. Sam Adams slyly pockets the white stocking instead of holding it up for ridicule. In the final section the quarrel between husband and wife comes to blows on his part before they become reconciled. But the 1914 story has really left the realm of action for the realm of emotion. Lawrence has transformed it into a psychological drama, in which all the main characters appear compelled to act out unknown parts from unconscious motives. Sentences are left unfinished, and both Whiston and his wife are taken by surprise by the violence of their own unsuspected feelings. The ending of the story gives some idea of the change in technique: . . . He went over, slowly, and very gently took her in his hands. She let herself be taken. Then as she lay against his shoulder, she sobbed aloud: 'I never meant —' 'My love — my little love —' he cried, in anguish of spirit, holding her in his arms. Back in 1907 Lawrence was wholly concerned with the actual story line. By the time he wrote the Smart Set version he was struggling to penetrate beneath his characters' conscious exteriors, but could only achieve this by spelling out for the reader's sake the feelings underlying their overt actions. But by 1914 Lawrence had mastered this problem and was communicating at the level of sub-conscious and unconscious emotion. This becomes apparent if one compares, for example, the three accounts of Sam's dancing with Prissy/Elsie. In 1907 Prissy enjoys dancing with Sam because of the status she acquires in being seen as the centre of her employer's attention. After her first dance she is 'flushed with triumph'. Her downfall similarly comes because she tries to prolong 'the triumph of the moment' at the centre of the dance-floor. In the periodical version, Sam Adams has a more personal appeal to her, being a superb dancer: . . . he gave her such support, she seemed to divine where he wanted her to go. This was the joy of it. . . . He was a man who knew what he was about. That last sentence shows Lawrence having to interpret for the reader the real fascination Elsie finds in Adams. But with the collected version of 1914 Lawrence has found himself. What gives Adams the edge over Whiston is the physical contact that the dancing allows Elsie and himself. Poor Whiston doesn't dance, so that he is temporarily blotted out of Elsie's emotional consciousness by the sheer magnetism of Sam's presence, even though her conscience (prodded by Whiston) struggles to repel the roué she knows him to be. In a battle between mind and body, the body is likely to be the more powerful force in the short run. This complex psychomachia is skilfully conveyed entirely through the action in this final version. There is no narrative intervention this time: That dance was an intoxication to her. After the first few steps, she felt herself slipping away from herself. She almost knew she was going, she did not even want to go. Yet she must have chosen to go. She lay in the arm of the steady, close man with whom she was dancing, and she seemed to swim away out of contact with the room, into him. She had passed into another, denser element of him, an essential privacy. By comparison to this experience, the disapproving Whiston 'had not made himself real to her. He was only a heavy place in her consciousness'. In a way he never becomes real to Elsie in this way until, driven into a paroxysm of rage, he strikes her across the mouth at the climax of the story, restoring the emotional equilibrium between them in the only sphere possible—the physical. In the final version hero and villain have been replaced by a more subtly balanced characterisation. Sam Adams now has great physical magnetism which is countered by 'the automatic irony of the roué'. Whiston feels ashamed of his own, however necessary, outbreak of violence. Right and wrong in the moral sense are no longer of interest to the mature Lawrence. Instead he focuses attention on emotional needs and their fulfillment. Whiston only defeats Adams at the dance when he makes physical contact with Elsie, just as he defeats Adams' continuing courtship from a distance by the violent blow that erupts from his unconscious. The amorality of nature has replaced the earlier moral codes that forced Lawrence to divide characters into sheep and goats, heroes and villains. Life itself now occupies the centre of the stage—life, irrational, irresistible and as vibrant as the final version of the story itself. 'The Shadow in the Rose Garden' has similarly survived in three separate versions. In its earliest version it must parallel quite closely an actual visit Lawrence made with his sweetheart, Jessie Chambers, to Robin Hood's Bay on the Yorkshire coast in 1907. 10 In 1935 Jessie Chambers confirmed the identification of the location of this story: 'The actual garden he describes I believe is one we visited at Robin Hood's Bay on one of our annual holidays'. 11 Lawrence wrote his first short stories for the Christmas 1907 competition of the Nottinghamshire Guardian and makes no mention of this story. 12 The holograph manuscript of this version, entitled 'The Vicar's Garden,' is at the University of Texas at Austin and, as Tedlock noted, 13 is on identical paper to that used for one of the three stories submitted in the winter of 1907. It is fair to surmise, therefore, that this first version was probably written early in 1908. The manuscript, like that of 'The White Stocking', is written on one side only of seven ruled leaves torn from a notebook. The typescript of this version is now in the library of the University of California at Berkeley. 'The Vicar's Garden' is a brief anecdote running to about 1,500 words. Like the 1907 version of 'The White Stocking', it concentrates on a story line, which this time turns upon the horror underlying the apparent beauty of the vicar's garden. The narrator and his sweetheart chance upon the vicar's garden and, enchanted with its beauty, are allowed to wander round it on their own. On their return to the landlady, she informs them that the vicar's son is now kept in confinement there, having gone mad from a fever he caught fighting abroad. The moral is crudely drawn by contrasting the girl's opening response to the locale with her later frightened reaction on learning the reality of the situation. At the beginning one reads: . . . When she began to speak I knew she had been taking a wistful look into the Future from the delightful promontory of the Present which we had gained now after a long hoping, and planning, and working. 'This,' she said, 'would be a perfect place for a honeymoon.' The inappropriate resort to allegory highlights Lawrence's concern at this time for a combination of literary allusion and didactic emphasis. The final sentence returns to the banal moral of the anecdote, once the truth has been learnt: 'The honeymoon will not, I fear, be spent by that bonny northern bay'. It is almost certain that Lawrence re-wrote 'The Vicar's Garden' as 'The Shadow in the Rose Garden' in July 1913, since he was asking his typist of 1913, Douglas Clayton, for the manuscript and typescript back of this story for further revision in July 1914. 14 The 1913 version is a little over three times the length of the earlier version. Accepted for publication by The Smart Set by December 1913, it appeared in its issue of March 1914. 15 As with 'The White Stocking', the pair are married in the later versions of the story. It is as if Lawrence felt compelled to write about his own situation, once he had eloped with Frieda. The story opens with the couple beginning their first morning's holiday in a state of suppressed conflict. The wife has brought her husband back to the seaside town where she had spent two years as a lady's companion before meeting her husband. Sending her husband out on his own for the morning, she visits the vicarage rose garden, where she meets the vicar's mad son with whom she had been in love during her earlier stay in the town. He fails even to recognise her. She returns shattered. Finally her husband forces her to confess that she and the vicar's son had been lovers, that he had gone off to fight abroad and become insane from some tropical disease, and that she had seen him that morning. The end of the 1913 version still echoes the bathos of the first version: '"We can't stop here then," he said.' The July 1914 version for the Duckworth collection, like that of 'The White Stocking', makes no major alterations in plot but excavates deeper into the characters' less conscious feelings. The 1908 anecdote revels in sentiment. The girl when in the garden exclaims 'I have never been so happy'. Within half a page she learns the truth from her landlady, who is herself in tears, and clings, terrified, to the narrator's arm. 'Ay, very sad, very sad,' exclaims the landlady, betraying the early Lawrence's lack of confidence in whether he has affected his reader likewise. The intermediate version still has lapses into sheer sentimentality. The wife, observing her mad lover from the past, reacts too like a stage heroine in 1913: He was mad. Her heart went still, and the world seemed to spin around her. Then a great tenderness filled her heart. He dropped his pipe. She picked it up and put it in his hand, as if he were a child. The contact with him made her tremble: he was the man she had loved, and still loved. In 1914 Lawrence showed more understanding of the psychological trauma that such an encounter would cause the wife: She sat and heard him talking. But it was not he. Yet those were the hands she had kissed, there were the glistening, strange black eyes that she had loved. Yet it was not he. She sat motionless with horror and silence. He dropped his tobacco pouch, and groped for it on the ground. Yet she must wait if he would recognise her. Why could she not go! Thematically the 1913 and especially the 1914 stories are no longer concerned with drawing facile distinctions between appearance and reality. The real focus of interest is on the relationship between husband and wife. The wife is held responsible in the 1913 version for the fact that the vicar's son left to fight abroad. Now she is in danger of destroying a second man, her husband. But he is not prepared to be cast aside by her indifference. Especially in the 1914 version he is made to display a surly, stubborn instinct for emotional self-preservation. He insists on having it out with his wife. In the violent release of hatred on both sides, the wife is finally forced to recognise the strength of her husband's personality, while he is made to acknowledge the gulf separating them. The couple are left at the end of the story in a position for the first time in their lives to begin to build that ideal relationship that Lawrence symbolised in his next novel by a rainbow, and in Women in Love by star polarity. The 1914 story ends on a non-event that in itself represents an entirely new basis for married life: He could not go near her. It would be a violation to each of them to be brought into contact with the other. The thing must work itself out. They were both shocked so much, they were impersonal, and no longer hated each other. After some minutes he left her and went out. One final development in this story between 1908 and 1914 is of interest. One can trace the growth in Lawrence's use of natural scenery for symbolic purposes. In the first version Lawrence anticipates in muted form the use he is to make of nature in Sons and Lovers as a norm against which characters can be judged. Already the girl in 'The Vicar's Garden' shows a little of the possessiveness towards flowers for which Paul damns Miriam: She lifted a heavy-headed rose, and I must put my face to its cool fresh lips, and inhale the sweetness and sympathy it breathed out to me. . . . Unless I admired and was ecstatic she was not satisfied. The girl then grasps a large spray of roses to her breast. But Lawrence's personally motivated criticism of the Jessie Chambers character has no thematic place in the story, whereas it is of central importance to Sons and Lovers , a novel about encroachment, or dependence and independence. By 1913 Lawrence is putting the roses to a different and more relevant use. The wife in search of her dead love wanders through the edenic garden of her past, feeling her present self disintegrating before the memory of a more beautiful life she had once shared with the vicar's son: She sat quite still, feeling her own existence lapse. She was no more than a rose, a rose that was going to fall, slip its white petals. But the image is still too tinged with self-pity and sentimentality. After all, the end of the story, far from showing the wife dying from this life, shows her being forced into the living present by her husband. By 1914 Lawrence has shed the last vestiges of sentiment and compelled his image to fulfill the symbolic function demanded by the narrative at the end: She was no more than a rose, a rose that could not quite come into blossom, but remained tense. . . . She was not herself. The rose has been used as a symbol for passion since time immemorial. This short passage now anticipates the later statement that 'she had never really loved him'. The story of 1914 traces her blossoming from past indifference to present awareness of the man she has married. Partly because of its length, partly because the first two-thirds of the story is already accessible in published form, I want to confine my remarks on 'Daughters of the Vicar' to clearing up a number of misapprehensions. Lawrence first wrote this story as 'Two Marriages' in July 1911. 16 He revised it for typing October 1911. 17 Two incomplete typescripts have survived. One is at the University of California at Berkeley and consists of the first 44 pages of the story (equivalent to the first nine and a half sections of the final published version of the story). This unfinished typescript was obviously used to publish the incomplete version of 'Two Marriages' that appeared posthumously as a supplement to Time and Tide on 24 March 1934. 18 The last third of 'Two Marriages' has survived as 22 pages of holograph manuscript in the private collection of Mr. George Lazarus (there is also one page of holograph manuscript from earlier in the story). The descriptions of Mr. Lazarus' holograph manuscripts and typescripts of 'Daughters of the Vicar' in Warren Roberts' Soho Bibliography have been superseded by the re-ordering of this material by Mr. Lazarus himself. He has been able to reassemble the new version of the story Lawrence wrote in 1913 after 'Two Marriages' had been turned down by the American magazine, the Century . 19 Using another typescript identical to that at Berkeley (though complete in the first place), Lawrence proceeded either to correct the typescript or substitute new holograph pages where the typescript needed more drastic revision. The result is a composite manuscript made up of 29 holograph manuscript pages and 30 corrected typescript pages, representing the re-named story, 'Daughters of the Vicar', which he then sent to Douglas Clayton in July 1913 for typing. 20 After he had failed to sell this version of the story to the Northern Syndicate, he once more revised it in July 1914 for inclusion in The Prussian Officer and Other Stories , as a comparison of the two texts confirms. 21 While the 1913 text bears the same reasonably close relationship to the 1914 published version as occurs in the other two stories examined, the 1911 story of 'Two Marriages' (written only a year before the final draft of Sons and Lovers ) still suffers from most of the faults discerned in his stories of 1907 and 1908. The plot is much closer to the finished version than is the case in either 'The White Stocking' or 'The Shadow in the Rose Garden'. But just as he allows his relationship to the possessive Jessie Chambers to intrude in 'The Vicar's Garden', so he betrays the continuing hold his mother still had on him a year after her death in Alfred's predicament after his mother has died: 'The pivot and main-spring of his life had been his mother, as a woman usually is, knowingly or unknowingly, the main-spring of a man's life'. This generalisation stands in opposition to one of the main themes of the story, Alfred's liberation from various kinds of external authority, whether from his parents or the navy. The 1911 version still occasionally contains those by now familiar lapses into sentimentality that mar Lawrence's fiction prior to Sons and Lovers . In the published section of 'Two Marriages' the mother actually offers to leave her son Alfred to Louisa, one of the vicar's daughters, if she'd have him—otherwise he'll go wrong, she claims self-righteously. The proposal scene in the unpublished holograph fragment is painfully unconvincing. Louisa lets Alfred make a fool of himself saying things like 'You've got to marry somebody' until she finally acquiesces, her voice breaks, she takes his head on her bosom, sobs there, and so on. In the finale Alfred Durant asks the vicar and his wife for permission to marry Louisa. The vicar's wife forbids it, but Louisa's married sister, Mary, intervenes for no apparent reason: 'Father, you will reconsider', she commands—and is improbably obeyed. She has to go through the same process to force her father to read the banns. 'Two Marriages' ends rather like a fairy story: Durant was infinitely glad of his wife. He served her his life long. But he had sufficient reserve, so that she never wearied him. She found a good deal of humiliation in her life: she was, socially, neither fish, flesh nor good red herring, as she laughingly said to her husband. . . . But what woman is not able to live socially alone, if it please her. She lived close and beautifully with her husband. 'The house is fairly clothed round with his work,' she said to herself once as (she) sat waiting for him to come from pit. Then suddenly she saw that their home was a fabric made out of his energy of tenderness: he had woven it out of his spirit. She sat still and worshipped in reverence. And she thought of the vicarage, where she had lived. Her children would be born into a real home, whose very stuff would have in it some of their father's spirit—and their mother's— and of their forefathers' and foremothers'. It would be nearly like a living thing, of their own blood. It was indeed a home. She dreamed of the boy, like Alfred, who would have the home when he left it. He would be like Alfred, but she would educate him. She had several children, and was not disappointed. The 1913 version is very much closer to the published story. Alfred now has to make a similar choice between dependence and independence, as Louisa alone did in 1911. To give some indication of the sort of changes Lawrence made at this stage, one might again look at the final section of the story. In this version Louisa's father stays in character by snobbishly refusing to give his consent to her marrying a coalminer. The couple go off and get married in a registry office, symbolising Louisa's break with the standards of her family, where social class and financial status come before personal fulfillment. But the ending is still too neat and moralistic to be satisfactory: 'But mother,' she said, when she had been married ten years, 'I've less to regret than any of them, and I've plenty to be thankful for. I chose my man myself, mother—and he wanted me. I was no fool.' She found she had a love that would wear. He did not always understand. But he was always hers, always there, always reliable. And they had some happy times, at evening, talking and reading, for he was intelligent and straight forward in his mind, if not very profound. Moreover, when she thought she knew him altogether, she would find she had been too ready. Queer little things he said, or a few half articulate words he spoke in his sleep, showed her his feeling went much deeper than it seemed, and she was ashamed for she had been tempted to draw a line under her estimate of him, and say, that was all. He was very happy, working all his life for her. She liked the house and garden, and therefore he spent most of his leisure planning out improvements, little conveniences. He was always busy, and she felt as if he were building his own little world around her. In the published version Alfred and Louisa are made to face the true consequences of their choice of personal satisfaction at the expense of social conformity. As the vicar's wife puts it, 'if you will have your own way, you must go your own way'. The story ends with Alfred and Louisa planning to get married in a registry office and emigrate to Canada. The demands of love may entail social ostracism, Lawrence has realised by this stage of his own life in exile with Frieda. This conflict between internal and external forms of authority runs through the last two stories to be written for this first collection, 'The Thorn in the Flesh' and 'The Prussian Officer'. It first surfaces as a major theme in his longer fiction in Women in Love , where Birkin and Ursula symbolically write out their letters of resignation before feeling free to explore life unfettered by social or moralistic codes and conventions (including that of traditional marriage). 1912, then, the year Lawrence eloped with Frieda, is a crucial landmark in his development as a writer. Before 1912 his own emotional immaturity (instanced in particular by his letters to Louie Burrows throughout 1911) prevented him from excavating in his fiction beneath the surface of plot and dialogue to uncover the deep emotional currents of the unconscious. By 1913 he was capable of writing 'The Prussian Officer', a story of such power and depth that it deserves to be ranked with The Rainbow and Women in Love . It is in 1913 and 1914 that Lawrence learnt to replace a reliance on plotted events by an emphasis on internal feelings, an appeal to sentimentality by a sterner regard for psychological realism, and an intrusive use of autobiographical material by narrative objectivity. What was explicit before 1912 becomes implicit after that date. The successive revisions Lawrence made to his first collection of short stories provide an illuminating glimpse into the making of one of this century's foremost writers. ___________________________________________________________________________ In view of the duplication that would result with the proposals in the Annual bibliography of the History of the Printed Book and Libraries to expand its coverage with the fourth volume, of 1973, the Society's Annual Selective Checklist has been discontinued as of this issue. ____________________________________________________________________________</field>
